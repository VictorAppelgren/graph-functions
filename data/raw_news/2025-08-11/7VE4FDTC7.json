  "title": "Why is Air India suspending flights between New Delhi and Washington DC?",
  "description": "Air India's suspension of service is \"due to a combination of operational factors, to ensure the reliability and integrity\" of the airline.",
  "content": "Air India is suspending services between New Delhi and Washington, D.C., starting on Sept. 1 due to aircraft shortages stemming from upgrades to its Boeing fleet and the ongoing ban on Indian carriers in Pakistan's airspace.\n\nThe company announced on Aug. 11 that the suspension is \"due to a combination of operational factors, to ensure the reliability and integrity of Air India\u2019s overall route network.\"\n\n\"The suspension is primarily driven by the planned shortfall in Air India\u2019s fleet, as the airline commenced retrofitting 26 of its Boeing 787-8 aircraft last month,\" the company said in a news release, adding this \"extensive retrofit program, aimed at significantly enhancing customer experience,\" will result in unavailability of multiple aircrafts until at least end of 2026.\n\nIn addition to its fleet upgrade, the closure of airspace over Pakistan \"impacts the airline\u2019s long-haul operations, leading to longer flight routings and increased operational complexity,\" the news release said. The airspace ban is estimated to cost Air India about $600 million over 12 months, Reuters reported.India and Pakistan closed their airspaces to each other days after relations nosedived following a fatal attack on civilians in Indian Kashmir in April. New Delhi has blamed Islamabad for the attack, which Islamabad denies.\n\nWhile there will no direct flights between the two capitals, Air India customers will have the option to choose flights to Washington, D.C., with layovers in New York, Newark, Chicago and San Francisco with the airline's partners Alaska Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, \"allowing customers to travel on a single itinerary with their baggage checked through to the final destination,\" the news release said.\n\nThe airline will also continue to \"operate non-stop flights between India and six destinations in North America, including Toronto and Vancouver in Canada.\"\n\nCustomers booked on flights to or from Washington, D.C. beyond September 1 will be contacted by the airline and offered alternative travel arrangements, including rebooking on other flights or full refunds, as per their individual preferences, the airline said.\n\nThe suspension also comes as Air India faces heightened regulatory scrutiny after a June crash of one of its Boeing planes in Ahmedabad killed 260 people.\n\nMeanwhile, passengers on a recent Air India flight from San Francisco to Mumbai via Kolkata encountered some unwelcome visitors early this month.\n\n\"On flight AI180 from San Francisco to Mumbai via Kolkata, two passengers were unfortunately bothered by the presence of a few small cockroaches on board,\" a spokesperson for the airline previously told USA TODAY in a statement Aug. 5. They notified a crew member who relocated them to different seats, where they were \"comfortable thereafter,\" the airline continued.\n\nDuring the scheduled fuel stop at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata, the aircraft was deep cleaned by the ground crew to address the issue, and continued its journey to Mumbai as scheduled.\n\n\"Despite our regular fumigation efforts, insects can sometimes enter an aircraft during ground operations,\" the airline added. \"Air India will be undertaking a comprehensive investigation to determine the source and the cause of this incident and implement measures to prevent recurrence. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to the passengers.\"\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "What it really means to be a Disney adult, according to an expert\n- Disney adults are a subculture of fans who find community and connection through Disney.\n- While some criticize Disney adults for enjoying activities associated with children, author AJ Wolfe argues that Disney has always catered to adults as well.\n- Wolfe's book, \"Disney Adults,\" explores the pros and cons of this subculture, including the positive aspects of community and the negative aspects of consumerism and exclusivity.\nSwifty. Gamer. Backpacker. Foodie.\nAll these labels bring vivid images to mind, but one group elicits particularly strong feelings from fans and observers alike: Disney adults.\nWhatever you think of when you hear the term, Disney expert AJ Wolfe, owner of DisneyFoodBlog.com and AllEars.net, wants to challenge that in her new book by the same name, \u201cDisney Adults.\u201d\n\u201cStereotypes are there for a reason, but what are the reasons that people are attacking this particular subculture? And what does that say about them versus us, as well?\u201d she asked.\nWolfe spoke with USA TODAY about what she discovered and her own experiences as a Disney adult.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nQuestion: Disney has been popular with adults from the very beginning. It's not a new phenomenon. Can you tell us about that?\nWolfe: There have been Disney adults for 100 years, really since Walt Disney started his whole empire back in the 1920s. Walt has a pretty well-known quote that says, \u201cYou\u2019re dead if you aim only for kids. Adults are only kids grown up, anyway.\" He knew from the very beginning that he had to make sure to entice the people who held the purse strings.\nWhat we've seen Disney adults evolve into though is an online subculture \u2013 primarily online, although things are starting to put their tendrils into in-person meetups and communities.\nPeople have this idea of what a Disney adult is. What do you want people to know about them?\nStereotypes come out of truth, right? There are some of us who are obsessed and obnoxious and selfish and problematic, but every fandom has those people. That's called humanity. That's what we are, as a culture in general.\nWhat people aren't really looking at \u2013 especially with Disney adults and I think with a lot of subcultures \u2013 is what's below the water when it comes to the iceberg.\nOnline, what algorithms are pushing is what people are watching: the extremes. You're not seeing the reality.\nEvery culture, every subculture, the majority of what's going on is stuff you don't see, stuff you have no idea about, so that's what we're doing with the book. It\u2019s really kind of showing how broad and extensive this subculture is and also pros and cons of it.\nLet's talk about some of those pros.\nWhat's great about this particular fandom is that people are finally finding their tribe. I think a lot of Disney adults don't fit anywhere else, and this is some place that they fit exquisitely. They find their best friends; they find their partners. You can find people you'd never find in your regular community or your workplace or your school.\nI think because a lot of us don't fit anywhere, we're very open and and happy to welcome everybody who finds some sort of solace here or who finds Disney to be interesting or compelling or curious or whatever. We're happy to talk to you about it. We're happy to bring you on where you are.\nWe are also very willing to help each other, so you see a lot of positives within the Disney community of fundraisers, charity work, people helping other people in the community and doing outreach outside of the community.\nBut the most important one, especially for me personally, is you find your tribe and your community, which honestly you can't be healthy without.\nFor many fans, Disney brings back core memories and a deep emotional connection that they feel when they go to the places Disney has created.\nThis is something that I really wanted to figure out while writing this book. How does Disney do this? Like, we\u2019re lining up to give them more money. How did they get such a hold on us?\nWhat it all stems back to for a lot of us as Disney adults is family and emotional connections. I blame our parents and our grandparents 1000% for bringing us to those Disney movies, for bringing us to Disney World and for having such a fabulous time while they were there that we kind of cottoned on to that and said, \u201cThis is when my dad and I really connect. This is when my grandma and I have something in common, and I remember this time.\u201d\nAnd now, with the world doing what it's doing and people just being high anxiety and feeling stressed and just regular life, you're going to want to try to get back to that feeling of safety and predictability and warmth and being taken care of, and so a lot of times people will go back to Disney.\nIt's a cycle because as you grow up with these things, you want to pass them on to your kids so they have the same experiences, and it raises another generation of fans.\nExactly. The thing that's also interesting about that is when I was raising my son, who's 11 now, we could have gone to Europe for vacation. We could have gone to Costa Rica, but that's harder than just going to Disney because Disney is so easy. They speak English, they take dollars, but it's still this experience you get to have. It's the easier choice.\nIt can be really hard to try to figure out an entirely different city that speaks a different language. And so I think when you have little kids, sometimes it's just, \"We're going to go to Disney for a little while because we know what to expect.\"\nYou want your kids to experience what you experienced, but also it's the devil you know.\nCan you talk about that feeling of FOMO a lot of Disney adults have about the latest snacks, the latest merch?\nThe marketing is unbelievable, and I'm not going to lie, the whole Disney adult community is doing this marketing for Disney for free.\nDisney has become a 24-hour news cycle. Hungry is the perfect word for the information, details, hot goss on their happy place, and that's exactly what they're trying to key into, because that's going to bring them that dopamine hit, that joy, that little feeling of \"I know what's going on and this person doesn't know what's going on.\"\nThere's also this weird hierarchy of \"How much do you know, and do you know more than other people? Do you have this pin? Do you have that Loungefly bag? Have you tried that snack? Have you been on that ride?\" It's just this wild subculture of one-upmanship and FOMO, and \"I have to right now book this trip because I have to be on that new ride.\" It's fascinating. I'm all caught up in it, too.\nCan you speak to some of the cons and address some of the criticisms people have of Disney adults?\nAbsolutely, and we have a whole chapter in the book about it.\nTwo main points that kind of keep coming up are, first, people are loving something that general society considers to be for kids. It's like you are not allowed, as an upstanding citizen, to like something that was built and created for children.\nWe heard Walt's quote. We know it wasn't built and created for children, but people are like, \u201cDisney is for kids. Why do you like something that\u2019s for kids? That's weird.\u201d And so that's verging on a lot of other weird things that people are uncomfortable with.\nSometimes Disney adults can be othering towards other theme parks.\nAs far I\u2019m concerned, a rising tide lifts all boats. Disney's going to get better because Universal's getting better. Universal's going to get better because Disney's getting better. I do feel like this is great for all of us. Can we just be cool?\nI think we shoot ourselves in the foot a lot when it comes to themed experiences because we're not willing to open our minds.\nOf course you can love something for free, but a lot of experiences cost money. Can you tell us about the role of money plays with Disney adults?\nThat's interesting that you say you can love something for free because what Disney has definitely done, even more so in the last couple of years, is there's a lot of their experiences that you cannot have unless you have a certain amount of money.\nCan you go to Disney cheap? Sure, but not that cheap. Those tickets cost at least $100, and so I think there is a feeling among Disney adults that Disney is out-pricing a lot of people and that they're getting to the point that it's just going to be a luxury item, at least for the parks, and they cannot afford to go anymore.\nI think you're starting to see, \u201cOh, only rich people can go to Disney. Only rich people can have these experiences.\u201d And Disney, in the past five years, has made a lot of their amenities that used to be free into paid amenities. You can't get them anymore unless you pay for them, so it's an evolving space.\nPeople will still pay it. That's the thing.\nIs there anything else you want people to know?\nMost importantly, the thing about this particular subculture and this book in general is that we are talking about humanity here. It's aspects of any group or community or subculture that you're seeing.\nI think you're going to see more and more and more subcultures emerge online, and you're going to see a lot more of our friends and connections and chosen family be people we've never met before.\nSo just sort of thinking about that and how do we comprehend these communities? How do we involve ourselves in these communities? How do we not be scared of these communities? Realize that there's so much more to these groups than you might think. Give yourself some time to really explore."

      "text": "These tourist hotspots are too crowded to enjoy this summer\n- Overtourism is causing travelers to avoid popular destinations due to strained infrastructure and depleted resources.\n- Crowded destinations may pose safety risks due to political tensions, environmental challenges, and crime.\n- Experts advise against visiting overcrowded locations like certain Thai islands, Dubrovnik, Santorini, and major European capitals.\nDo I really need to show you pictures of Dubrovnik, Croatia, when there's a cruise ship in town, or of the Trevi Fountain in Rome on a hot day, to prove travel has never been as crowded as it is this summer?\nProbably not. A recent survey by Global Rescue found that 73% of travelers are worried about overtourism, and more than half are actively avoiding popular destinations like France, Spain, Italy, and Thailand.\nCheck out Elliott Confidential, the newsletter the travel industry doesn't want you to read. Each issue is filled with breaking news, deep insights, and exclusive strategies for becoming a better traveler. But don't tell anyone!\n\u201cOvertourism weakens destinations by straining infrastructure and depleting resources,\u201d said Dan Richards, CEO of Global Rescue. \u201cIt leaves them ill-equipped to handle crises, whether it\u2019s a natural disaster or a surge in crime.\u201d\nBut are overcrowded destinations dangerous? And what places should you avoid \u2013 or not avoid?\nAre crowded summer travel destinations more dangerous?\nTraveling to a popular and overcrowded destination can be risky. A combination of political tensions, environmental challenges, and crime concerns requires travelers to be more diligent in planning, said Frank Harrison, regional security director for the Americas at World Travel Protection.\n\"Many destinations that were once considered relatively safe now face multiple interlinked problems that heighten the risks for travelers,\" he added. \"Travel is certainly more complex.\"\nEven with all the crowds, you might be perfectly safe. But that doesn't mean you'll have a positive experience. There's a growing backlash against mass tourism in some destinations, so you might feel unwelcome.\n\"This backlash results in new restrictions on tourism or a less welcoming atmosphere for travelers,\" explained John Rose, the chief risk officer at ALTOUR, a global corporate travel management company. \"It makes some traditionally popular destinations less appealing or more challenging to navigate.\"\nOne way to avoid the chaos is to ask a professional for advice. A competent travel adviser will help ensure that you don't end up standing in a long line this summer. But what does your travel adviser know that you don't?\nPlaces you should skip this summer\nSome destinations are just too hot \u2013 literally and figuratively \u2013 to handle this summer. Here\u2019s where experts say you should think twice before booking:\n\u25feThailand: Thailand\u2019s tropical islands have long been a magnet for travelers looking for sun, sand, and affordability. But now there are too many tourists. Experts are advising their clients to steer clear of places like Phuket, Pattaya and Krabi. \u201cPrices are inflated, pollution is rising, and the quality of life for locals is declining,\" says Alonso Marly, a travel adviser at Skylux Travel.\nAlternate: Try Chiang Mai, in the northern part of Thailand, which is less touristy and calmer, or Bangkok, which has more room \u2013 and better shopping.\n\u25feCroatia: Thanks to its starring role in \"Game of Thrones\" and its popularity among cruise passengers, Dubrovnik has become one of Europe\u2019s most overcrowded cities. With just 41,000 residents, it\u2019s struggling to handle the influx of tourists. Tourists have caused traffic jams and, on busy days, have made the city almost completely inaccessible.\nAlternate: Check out Split, which also has an impressive historical inner city (with fewer walls), or head to Zagreb, which is less crowded but still offers a classic Croatian experience.\n\u25fe Greece: Santorini\u2019s brilliant white houses and blue-domed churches have made it a bucket-list destination. But with over 3.4 million visitors annually, the island is buckling under the pressure. Locals are protesting the large influx of tourists, which is making the city unlivable during high season. Other Greek islands, including Mykonos and Corfu, have also been hit hard.\nAlternate: Athens and Thessaloniki are always safe bets. They can get busy during the summer, but a little less frenzied than the Greek islands.\n\u25feEurope's tourism capitals: You know what I'm talking about: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lisbon, and Venice. These European cities are grappling with anti-tourist sentiment fueled by rising housing costs and overcrowding. Add record-breaking heat waves, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for a miserable trip.\nAlternate: Get off the beaten path \u2013 even just a little \u2013 and you could have a much saner experience. I spent last July in Berlin, and was impressed with how uncrowded it was. I also spent time in Helsinki and northern Sweden, and managed to escape the crowds. Even August in Stockholm isn't so bad because many residents leave town for a month.\nThis is by no means the full list. Chances are, if you want to go somewhere that's popular, it might be too full. For example, if you're thinking of visiting Rome this summer, remember that it's a Jubilee year, so it's going to be extra crowded.\nSafer bets: Where to go instead\nSo, where should you go? The safest destinations are the ones marked in the U.S. State Department Travel Advisory system as a Level 1 or Level 2, said John Gobbels, chief operating officer of air medical transport and travel security program Medjet.\n\"But even then, be wary,\" he added. \"Be careful where you go and whom you trust. Do research on the safest and least safe parts of town because every town has parts you probably should not be walking alone in at night.\"\nBerkshire Hathaway Travel Protection (BHTP) releases a report of the safest destinations every year, and it's widely considered the gold standard for travel safety. BHTP's research is based on factors such as terrorism, environmental issues and flight delays. On this list this year: Iceland, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand.\n\u201cAfter years of conducting this research, patterns have emerged and certain countries and cities, like Switzerland and Singapore, have become mainstays,\u201d said Carol Mueller, BHTP's head of marketing.\nBut you don't have to be a security expert to know that some places are riskier than others. I've been traveling around the world for years, and the BHTP list is my go-to for a safe and relatively uncrowded place, even during the summer.\nWhy? Well, for a variety of reasons. For example, it's winter in Australia and New Zealand, which means it's low season, unless maybe you're going skiing on the South Island. Switzerland and Singapore are too expensive to attract the kind of mass tourism you find in Barcelona or Santorini. Iceland is beautiful, but isolated.\nBe a contrarian this summer\nThe takeaway is the same: If you want to avoid overcrowded destinations this summer, be a contrarian. When everyone else goes north, head south. When they flock to popular destinations, stray off the beaten path.\nAnd yes, I will be in Europe this summer, but my itinerary is taking me to the places where fewer tourists go. Reykjavik, Prague, Luxembourg, Munich and my ancestral hometown of Amykles, Greece. It's close to the chaos, but not too close. Maybe I'll see you out there.\nChristopher Elliott is an author, consumer advocate, and journalist. He founded Elliott Advocacy, a nonprofit organization that helps solve consumer problems.

      "text": "No front desk staff, just a tablet. Guest's hotel check-in video goes viral.\nThe kiosk will be removed, a Wyndham Hotels representative said.\nPete Sager had anything but a normal check-in when he arrived at a La Quinta hotel in Florida last month.\nInstead of staff greeting him from behind the front desk, a single candle burned on the empty counter. Taking to social media to share, a single video of his abnormal experience has garnered millions of views.\nSager, of Frisco, Texas, checked in to the La Quinta Inn & Suites in Sunrise, Florida on Friday, July 25, according to documents Sager shared with USA TODAY. Rather than making small talk with a front desk employee, Sager said he was greeted by a man on a tablet, who was helping guests remotely. Seizing on the abnormal moment, Sager said he recorded his interaction with the man on the screen using a pair of AI glasses.\nWhile Sager posted the video to his own social media, it gained traction after it was reposted by another social media user on X (formerly Twitter). As of Aug. 8, the reshared video had more than 2.1 million views.\nWhat happened?\nWhen Sager arrived to the La Quinta Inn & Suites, he first saw a group of people arguing with a tablet at a kiosk. The tablet, as seen in the video, sat under a green banner that read, \"Check in and out here!\" Sager said members of the group were asking for more towels and were told by the remote worker they would arrive the next day.\nSager said when it was his turn to step up to the kiosk, he began recording, joking with the man on the other side of the screen that he took his job. Sager said when he asked the man where he was based, he was told Florida.\nIn addition to the tablet, Sager said the kiosk included tech for guests to tap a debit or credit card and scan an ID. The tablet, which displayed the remote worker, also allowed guests to sign the necessary documents as they would traditionally do at a hotel front desk, he added. The kiosk also had an output that distributed room keys.\nDuring his two nights at the hotel, Sager said the only staff he saw on site were cleaning staff.\n\"The lack of staff could be concerning for someone who's paying for a visit,\" Sager told USA TODAY. \"It's not a four star (hotel), but it's not a two star, and it's in a part of Florida where it's a destination area. It's not like an Iowa on-the-side-of-the-road, where you're just stopping to sleep and get going.\"\nTwo nights at the hotel cost about $150, per Sager's receipt, which he provided to USA TODAY.\nA concern of safety\nSager said he also found the lack of hotel staff concerning in relation to guest safety.\n\"When I was at the pool, there were some kids out there and I thought, 'You know what, if anything happened, there's no staff here to come out and attend to an emergency,'\" Sager said. \"Say someone cuts their foot, a kid hits his head ... What are you going to do? Run to a screen and it's going to be like, 'Okay, I'll call somebody.'\"\nWyndham: Kiosk not approved, to be removed\nThe La Quinta where the incident occurred is a franchised location, meaning it is independently owned and staffed, Robert Myers, Wyndham Hotels & Resort external communications vice president, told USA TODAY.\n\"That said, this franchisee\u2019s use of this equipment is not brand approved nor is it being marketed to other franchisees. Further, our brand standards require hotels to have a team member physically stationed at the front desk at all times,\" Myers added. \"Upon learning of this matter, we immediately reached out to the hotel\u2019s owner who has since informed us the hotel will be removing the kiosk.\"\nWhat are people saying online?\nLargely, online users have expressed their discomfort by the remote staff.\n\"This is getting way out of hand. This is 100% absurd,\" one TikTok user commented on Sager's video.\nAnother commented: \"This should literally be illegal.\"\nBut others cited remote check-in options at other hotel branches, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, guests at select Hilton hotels may check in without talking to a single employee, checking in on a mobile app and using the same app as a digital key to unlock their room. Wyndham, in fact, offers mobile check-in, too, rolling out the initiative to about 9,000 hotels across the globe in December 2020.\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Skip the buffet: These 6 kid-friendly resorts serve gourmet meals\nIf your idea of dining at an all-inclusive family resort involves endless lines and boring buffets, it's time for an update. These days, the food scene at many of the top all-inclusive resorts is anything but blas\u00e9.

With so much unspoiled coastline, it\u2019s no surprise that a windfall of fresh fish is a big part of the resort's culinary scene.

Fairmont Mayakoba\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\nImmersed in a mangrove jungle intersected by canals, Fairmont Mayakoba is a luxurious resort on a swath of Caribbean beach that\u2019s the definition of tropical paradise. It\u2019s home to exotic parrots, monkeys, and sea turtles that delight kids and kids at heart, and it's one of the world's top all-inclusive resorts for impressive cuisine because there are just so many global dining options from Korean barbecue to a New York-style steakhouse.\nSAIL AND SAVE: Kids sail free on these 8 cruise lines, including river cruises\nAt the resort's Sweet Spot, Mexican confections join rainbow-swirl lollipops and old-fashioned bulk candy, a treat for anyone with a sweet tooth.

      "text": "Two expeditions in one: New Seabourn cruise takes guests to Arctic, Antarctica\n- Seabourn's new \"Pole to Pole: Grand Expedition\" cruise will sail from the Arctic to the Antarctic in a single 94-day voyage in 2027.\n- The itinerary includes stops in 14 countries and territories, featuring diverse wildlife encounters and exploration of remote regions like Ellesmere Island.\nSeabourn already takes guests on expedition cruises to the icy wilds of the Arctic and Antarctica. Now, a new itinerary will combine both into one voyage.\nThe luxury line will offer its \u201cPole to Pole: Grand Expedition\u201d in 2027, sailing more than 20,500 nautical miles over 94 days.\n\u201cThis is the first time in Seabourn\u2019s history \u2013 and one of the first in the cruise industry \u2013 that a luxury expedition has been designed to explore both polar regions in a single sailing,\u201d Robin West, Seabourn\u2019s Vice President of Expedition Operations & Planning, told USA TODAY in an email. \u201cThe idea was born from our desire to push the boundaries of expedition travel and create a journey that few could even imagine, let alone undertake. With Seabourn Venture\u2019s advanced capabilities and PC6 Polar Class rating, we knew we had the right ship to make it a reality.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what guests can expect.\nWhen is Seabourn\u2019s \u2018Pole to Pole\u2019 expedition?\nThe itinerary will start in Reykjavik, Iceland, on Aug. 17, 2027. Guests will spend the night there before taking a charter flight to Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, to board the 264-guest Venture.\nWhere will the expedition cruise go?\nWest said the sailing\u2019s combined format will give visitors a \u201cmuch deeper perspective.\u201d\n\u201cTraveling from pole-to-pole in a single expedition allows guests to witness the full spectrum of Earth\u2019s most remote environments,\u201d he said. \u201cIn doing this, the format eliminates itinerary repetition and creates a natural progress through changing ecosystems, cultures, and wildlife. It also gives our expedition team the opportunity to guide our guests through the shifts in environment across hemispheres.\u201d\nPassengers will explore destinations in 14 countries and territories, from Canada to Brazil and Argentina, and explore famed waterways and remote regions. Those include six days in the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; three days in South Georgia, home to king penguins and other wildlife; and five days in Antarctica.\nThe trip also includes three days at Ellesmere Island, a lesser-visited destination in the Arctic Archipelago. \u201cThe island is home to fewer than 200 people and remains one of the most pristine and isolated environments on Earth,\u201d said West. \u201cOur guests will have the rare opportunity to explore Canada\u2019s northernmost landmass \u2013 an area few will ever reach \u2013 featuring dramatic Arctic landscapes such as ice caps, ancient glaciers, and rugged mountain ranges.\u201d\nGuests will primarily explore Alexandra Fiord, and get the chance to see musk oxen, polar bears, walruses and more. The agenda isn\u2019t all chilly, either: other stops include warmer locales such as Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Barbados. The adventure will come to a close in Ushuaia, Argentina, where passengers can board a charter flight to Buenos Aires.\nHow much does the \u2018Pole to Pole\u2019 expedition cruise cost?\nThe 94-day expedition starts at $104,999 per person based on double occupancy. That includes dining on the ship, Zodiac landings, onboard lectures, Wi-Fi and more.\nThe sailing is currently available to book for previous Seabourn guests, and opens to the general public on Aug. 13.\nNathan Diller is a consumer travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Nashville.

They notified a crew member who relocated them to different seats, where they were \"comfortable thereafter,\" the airline continued.\nDuring the scheduled fuel stop at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata, the aircraft was deep cleaned by the ground crew to address the issue and continued its journey to Mumbai as scheduled.\n\"Despite our regular fumigation efforts, insects can sometimes enter an aircraft during ground operations,\" the airline added. \"Air India will be undertaking a comprehensive investigation to determine the source and the cause of this incident and implement measures to prevent recurrence. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to the passengers.\"\nThis isn't the first time a cockroach has made an appearance on an Air India flight. In 2019, a passenger said he found a dead bug in the in-flight meal he was served.\nEarlier this summer, a TikTok went viral after a Spirit Airlines passenger shared her experience of finding cockroaches crawling around on the bulkhead near her seat. She said she told the flight attendants, who didn't help, and the airline ended up offering her a voucher."

      "text": "How India-Pakistan conflict pushed planes off course\nClosure of airspace and military confrontation lead to rerouting of flights, swelling flight times and associated costs\nFresh tension between India and Pakistan has hit the commercial aviation industry, forcing rerouting of flights and cancellations.\nIndia said it struck nine Pakistani \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d sites on May 7, some of them hundreds of kilometers inside Pakistan, while the latter claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets. The strikes came two weeks after an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, which India blamed on terrorists backed by Pakistan.\nFollowing India\u2019s military strikes, several airlines said they were re-routing or cancelling flights over or near the region. Dozens of flights were cancelled or diverted to avoid Pakistan\u2019s airspace, flight-tracking website FlightRadar24 showed. Several airports were also shut in northern India.\nMaps show airborne flights over India, Pakistan and neighbouring regions before and after India conducted military strikes across nine locations in Pakistan. The airspace looks almost clear of aircrafts after the strikes, while air traffic built up south of Pakistan over the Arabian Sea.\nEven as the fresh tension led nearly all aircraft to stay away from Pakistan and northern India, the rerouting of some flights had began earlier.\nIndia unveiled a slew of measures against Pakistan last month, including suspending a water-sharing pact, soon after the terror attack in Indian Kashmir. In retaliation, Pakistan shut its airspace to Indian airlines on April 24, amid other measures. India retaliated by shutting its airspace to Pakistani carriers.\nIndia relies heavily on Pakistan airspace\nA map shows locations of India and Pakistan.\nThese are all the routes scheduled by Indian airlines in the first week of May touching the country\u2019s top 15 international airports, according to FlightRadar24. The airlines operate close to 4,000 direct flights a week across more than 200 routes linking 61 international destinations.\nThe same map now highlights all the scheduled routes of Indian airlines in early May from India\u2019s top 15 international airports.\nThe routes that cross Pakistan account for 20% of Indian flights with foreign destinations and 30% of their flights heading west. These primarily connect with the northern Indian cities of Amritsar and Lucknow, besides the capital, New Delhi.\nThe map now only highlights the routes connecting Indian airports with destinations in the west that would require the flights to fly over Pakistan if they were to take the shortest routes.\nFor airlines from Pakistan, on the contrary, 99% of their flights do not need to fly through Indian airspace.\nThe map now highlights all the routes linking 10 airports in Pakistan with foreign destinations that are serviced by the Pakistani airlines.\nAs a result, only eight flights a week that Pakistan International Airlines operates to Kuala Lumpur and Beijing are potentially affected by the ban India imposed on Pakistani airlines.\nThe same map now highlights three routes that link Pakistani airports to destinations in the east, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur.\nThe same map is now repeated.\nNot all Indian airlines\u2019 flights are equally affected. Some need a very short detour to bypass airspace over Pakistan, such as connections between New Delhi and Nairobi or the city of Lucknow and Muscat.\nAdded flight time\nA Reuters analysis of 75 daily flights between the northern Indian cities of Delhi, Amritsar and Lucknow and destinations requiring them to cross Pakistan shows their duration increased by 47 minutes on average after Pakistan shut its airspace on April 24.\nThe increase in duration ranged from a few minutes for flights linking Delhi with Doha, Jeddah and Dubai in the Middle East, to as much as four hours for flights connecting Delhi with the cities of San Francisco in the United States and Vancouver in Canada.\nEach dot shows how much longer or shorter a flight was each day than its usual duration before Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian airlines.\nCharts show flight durations of about 75 daily flights linking northern Indian cities of New Delhi, Lucknow and Amritsar to destinations in Americas, Europe and Middle East, by their deviation from average durations before and after Pakistan shut its airspace for Indian aircrafts on April 24. Flights connecting Americas added an average of 2.8 hours to flying time while flights to the Europe added more than an hour on average. Flights linking Middle East were lengthened by an average of 18 minutes.\nOn average, flights with the Americas added 2.8 hours to flying time, excluding fuelling stopovers, while flights to European cities added more than an hour on average. Flights connecting the Middle East were the least affected, lengthened by an average of 18 minutes.\nWide range of impact\nFlights connecting Delhi with Central Asia were badly affected, made longer by the need to go all the way around Pakistan.\nIndia\u2019s leading airline, IndiGo, cancelled direct flights to Tashkent in Uzbekistan and Almaty in Kazakhstan for at least 10 days, saying limited rerouting options placed the destinations \u201coutside the operational range\u201d of its current fleet.\nMaps show flight paths of two IndiGo flights, linking New Delhi with Tashkent and Almaty, before and after Pakistan shut its airspace for Indian airlines.\nThe routes that have added the most to their flight time connect New Delhi with destinations in the United States and Canada. Some have had passengers stay on the aircraft for an additional five to six hours, which includes a refuelling stopover in Europe.\nThe long detours and stopovers mean higher fuel costs for the airlines and longer journey times for passengers and crew, in light of which India\u2019s aviation regulator has allowed Air India to temporarily extend maximum duty hours and rest periods for pilots on long-haul routes. Air India was expecting to face additional costs of about $600 million if Pakistan\u2019s airspace ban were to last for a year.\nMaps show flight paths of two Air India flights, linking New Delhi with New York and Vancouver, before and after Pakistan shut its airspace for Indian airlines.\nFor Pakistan\u2019s largest carrier, Pakistan International Airlines, only two routes linking the cities of Islamabad and Lahore with the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur stand to be affected by the Indian airspace ban. Its only other route connecting an eastern location is Islamabad\u2013Beijing, which had bypassed Indian airspace even before the current conflict.\nMap shows the flight path of a Pakistan International Airlines flight between Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur before and after India shut its airspace for Pakistani airlines.\nBesides carriers from India and Pakistan, some European airlines had also started rerouting some long-haul flights around Pakistan at least a week before India\u2019s May 7 strikes. These include Air France, Lufthansa, Swiss International Airlines and British Airways, a list from FlightRadar24 shows.\nCiting \u201crecent evolution of tensions\u201d between India and Pakistan, Air France said it was suspending \u201coverflight of Pakistan until further notice\u201d. Lufthansa also confirmed it was \u201cavoiding Pakistani airspace until further notice\u201d.\nMaps show the flight paths of a select few flights by four European carriers that rerouted their flights connecting India and South East Asia around Pakistan.\nThe airspace ban has an impact beyond rerouting of flights and associated costs. Pakistan may see a drop in its earnings from overflight fees, which can run into hundreds of dollars a flight.\nTop illustration by\nArathy J Aluckal\nAdditional reporting by\nSudev Kiyada\nSources\nFlightRadar24; Natural Earth; India\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aviation\nEdited by\nSimon Scarr and Clarence Fernandez"

      "text": "Phones, jewelry, linens: Which products could cost more due to Trump's India tariffs?\nPresident Donald Trump announced the United States will impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, bringing import levies on some items as high as 50%.\nThe Wednesday, Aug. 6, order from the president comes less than a week after the first round of 25% tariff hikes were announced for the South Asian nation and significant U.S. trading partner. Trump cited New Delhi's continued imports of Russian oil as the reason behind this newest measure, sharply escalating tensions between the two countries after months of negotiations over a possible limited trade agreement fell through.\nThe new tariffs on some Indian goods would be among the steepest faced by any U.S. trading partner. Trade analysts warned the tariffs could severely disrupt Indian exports, according to Reuters. The president's order says the additional 25% tariff will go into effect 21 days after the previously-announced 25% tariff, which was set to take hold Aug. 7.\nTrump announced the initial 25% tariff in a post on his social media app Truth Social on July 30, two days before a bevy of increased reciprocal tariffs went into effect for dozens of nations on Aug. 1.\nIndia, the world's fifth largest economy in 2024, relies significantly on the U.S., counting it as its top trading partner last year. Indian goods exported to the U.S. totaled $87 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, with pharmaceuticals and jewelry among its top product types, followed by petrochemicals and textiles. Separately, services exports, mainly IT and professional services, were worth $33 billion last year.\nThe U.S. is India\u2019s third-largest investor, and has a $45.7 billion trade deficit with the South Asian nation.\nHere are some of the products the U.S. relies on most from India, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\nPharmaceuticals\nThe U.S. accounts for nearly a third of India's pharmaceutical exports, mainly cheaper versions of popular drugs, Reuters reports, with sales jumping 16% to about $9 billion last fiscal year.\nAmong the dozens of types of medications and supplies the U.S. imports from India, a few classifications make up a significant share. They are items like wadding, gauze and bandages; antineoplastic and immunosuppressive medications, including those used to treat cancers; and analgesics, antipyretics and nonhormonal anti-inflammatory agents, such as pain relievers and medications used to reduce fevers.\nSmartphones\nThough China and Vietnam were responsible for more than half of phones sent to the U.S. last year, India also produces a significant share, and looks to be gaining a firmer foothold in the market.\nAccording to a new report, India has overtaken China in the last few months as the top exporter of smartphones to the U.S., following Apple\u2019s pivot to center manufacturing in New Delhi amid tariff concerns. The share of U.S. smartphone shipments assembled in China fell from 61% to 25% over the past year, the research firm Canalys said, with India picking up most of the decline and increasing its smartphone volume by 240% roughly within the same time frame.\nJewelry and precious stones\nNext to pharmaceuticals, jewelry and precious stones are among India's top products exported to American consumers. About 30% of India's gems and jewelry exports go to the U.S., accounting for about $10 billion in annual trade, said Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India, per Reuters.\nThese goods include unmounted or unset diamonds, precious metal jewelry and jewelry clad with precious metal \u2212 such as pieces plated with gold or silver.\nHome linens\nIndia is among the top countries responsible for imported home linens in the U.S., representing 36% of nearly $6 billion in imports, according to a New York Times analysis of government data.\nThese products include bathroom and kitchen linen made of terrycloth or cotton, along with bed and table linens.\nIndia is also a leader in some types of imported clothing, such as activewear, shirts, baby clothes and suits. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the tariff hikes so far have disproportionately affected clothing and textiles, with consumers facing up to 39% higher shoe prices and 37% higher apparel prices in the short run.\nOther products\nThe U.S. also relies on Indian imports of frozen shrimp and prawns, petroleum oils such as transformer oil and motor fuel, semiconductor technologies like solar panels and certain types of electrical machinery and parts.\nContributing: Reuters; Joey Garrison, USA TODAY.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.
