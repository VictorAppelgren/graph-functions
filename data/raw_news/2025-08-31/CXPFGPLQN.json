I\u2019ve had my hands in the same spot for the last three-plus years. \u201cMoving your hands is obviously a big change for a pitcher, and it probably affects your mechanics a little bit.",

      "text": "Mets\u2019 bullpen gets major makeover with Ryan Helsley, Tyler Rogers trade deadline moves\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 With one day still to go before the trade deadline, there is time for David Stearns to attempt to add maybe a center fielder and perhaps a starter.\nThe Mets president of baseball operations did not wait, though, to form what he hopes will be a super bullpen, instantly transforming a shaky group into what looks to be the team\u2019s greatest strength.\nIf the Mets do not out-slug opponents in October, they will hope to outlast them with a group of relievers that projects to be as strong as any after a busy Wednesday.\nStearns pushed plenty, but not nearly all, of his chips in to add a pair of very different righties \u2014 flamethrower Ryan Helsley from the Cardinals and submariner Tyler Rogers from the Giants \u2014 just a few days after bringing in another hard thrower in Gregory Soto.\nThe late innings \u2014 and the middle innings for that matter, especially considering the rotation\u2019s struggles to pitch deep into games \u2014 might be locked down with a deep unit filled with dominant stuff and different looks.\nThe prospect cost was significant for the depth of the farm system but not the top of the farm system, losing their Nos. 8, 10, 12 and 16 prospects, according to MLB Pipeline, along with one unranked and major league reliever Jos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3.\n\u201cWe got better as a team,\u201d manager Carlos Mendoza said after a 5-0 loss at Petco Park, where the Mets were silenced by a filthy bullpen they want to emulate.\nHelsley, an impending free agent, is a two-time All-Star with a 3.00 ERA and a 100 mph fastball. He led the majors in saves last season, when he was so overwhelming he finished ninth in NL Cy Young Award voting.\nRogers, also a free agent at season\u2019s end, nearly scrapes his right hand on the mound when he pitches. The unique angle has proven difficult to hit \u2014 he owns a 1.80 ERA this season and 2.79 mark for his career \u2014 and might help his durability.\nWith the slowest fastball in MLB (averaging 83.3 mph), Rogers leads the majors in games pitched (53) and led the majors in the category a season ago (77). Against an arm angle rarely seen in today\u2019s game, neither lefties nor righties have hit the 34-year-old well.\nThe Mets can envision a group of Edwin D\u00edaz, Helsley, Rogers, Soto, Brooks Raley, Reed Garrett and Ryne Stanek \u2014 and perhaps a fresher Huascar Brazob\u00e1n \u2014 overwhelming opponents in the postseason.\n\u201cI might be throwing the fourth inning now,\u201d said Stanek, which would be a scary thought for opposing offenses.\nGone are infielder Jesus Baez (the top-rated prospect lost but a 20-year-old who is at least several years away), righty Nate Dohm (a 2024 third-round pick having a strong season with High-A Brooklyn) and righty Frank Ellisalt (a 2024 19th-round pick who has impressed mostly with Low-A St. Lucie), who were packaged for Helsley.\nGone are outfielder Drew Gilbert (who was having a nice, if not excellent, season with Triple-A Syracuse), righty Blade Tidwell (who debuted this season and flashed good raw stuff in four games) and Butt\u00f3(who hugged teammates as news spread during the early innings of Wednesday\u2019s game), who were sent to the Giants. They represent losses to the system but from its depth.\nGilbert likely was behind Carson Benge and Jett Williams among the prospects who could grow into major league center fielders; Tidwell was slotted behind at least Brandon Sproat, Nolan McLean and Jonah Tong and might not have survived the offseason on the 40-man roster; Butt\u00f3, who was out of minor league options, might not have survived on the 26-man roster considering the upgrades.\nThe Mets bullpen was the game\u2019s best through April, when arms such as A.J. Minter, Danny Young and Max Kranick powered the group. That trio \u2014 along with 2024 revelation Dedniel N\u00fa\u00f1ez \u2014 are gone for the season with elbow surgeries.\nThe Mets have suffered since and entered play Wednesday with a 4.87 bullpen ERA since June that was the sixth worst in the majors.\nAn electric arm like Helsley\u2019s can help.\nA funky arm like Rogers\u2019 can help.\n\u201cNot easy. It\u2019s tough to track,\u201d Francisco Lindor said of Rogers, against whom he is 1-for-5. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to help us.\u201d\nWhether the Mets are truly Going For It can be better measured at Thursday\u2019s deadline, when Stearns can seek additional help. Without question, though, they are Going For a super bullpen."

      "text": "Access the Mets beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Mike Puma about the inside buzz on the Mets.\nTry it freeFor what will be the only time this year at Citi Field, a Juan Soto strikeout was met with cheers.\nAnother long bottom of the inning mercifully had ended, this one entailing the Mets scoring seven runs. Finally, the 42,112 on hand could be done with the overwhelming and over-boring Mets offense and could watch Jonah Tong pitch again.\nFor one energetic night in Queens, the majority of the sellout crowd preferred the starting pitcher to his team. Such is the excitement for Tong, a 22-year-old phenom known for a nastiness on the mound and an earnestness off of it.\nThere is plenty of hope that the future of the Mets was on display Friday \u2014 a future that might have just arrived. Tong was intriguing, if not perfect, in his debut, a 19-9 destruction of the Marlins in a contest whose result was decided as the first five Mets batters of the game scored. When the onslaught was finished, the club had set a new franchise record for runs scored at home and had given Luis Torrens a taste of pitching.\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to complain about run support. That was insane,\u201d said Tong, who weathered Day 1 nerves, interminable half-innings and a defense that let him down late, but his stuff flashed enough that the club can envision that it has unwrapped a second Nolan McLean in the heat of a playoff race.\nWhen his five innings were over \u2014 punctuated by a called strike three to ring up Liam Hicks, home-plate umpire Andy Fletcher perhaps coaxed by a crowd desperate for the escape \u2014 Tong had allowed four runs (just one earned) on six hits with zero walks and six strikeouts. He had not allowed four runs in any of his 22 starts with Double- or Triple-A, but miscues behind him were more to blame.\n\u201cThat\u2019s everything I ever dreamed of as a kid growing up,\u201d said Tong, who will get at least a second chance to relive that childhood dream as the Mets will remain with their six current starting pitchers the next turn through the rotation.\nTong\u2019s debut will be better remembered for the life in the ballpark than the life on his pitches (which was excellent, though). When the outgoing and smiley personality emerged at 6:20 p.m. from the dugout to walk to the bullpen, the group of fans down the right field line stood and applauded \u2014 about 50 minutes before first pitch. When he emerged from the bullpen, a louder cry rang out.\n\u201cThis atmosphere, this environment is a lot of fun,\u201d Brandon Nimmo said.\n\u201cI think the whole team was in the dugout for the first pitch today,\u201d manager Carlos Mendoza said. \u201cEverybody wanted to see that, wanted to watch that.\u201d\nThe kid from Canada warmed up to Nickelback and heard Rush and the \u201cThong Song\u201d between innings and after strikeouts. There is a new fan favorite in Flushing, and if he did not immediately announce himself as an ace, he did leave the crowd and the Mets wanting to see more.\nDisplaying his Tim Lincecum-esque delivery, the spry, generously listed 6-foot-1 righty maxed out at 97.7 mph, relied heavily on a changeup that induced a few whiffs and more weak contact and mixed in a curveball that he used to record his first strikeout.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND METS STATS\nHe needed six pitches to retire the Marlins in order in the first and endured 20-plus-minute breaks before pitching into and out of trouble in the second and third innings before taking the mound in the fourth.\nAs Citi Field stood to thank its military veteran of the game, Tong, too, used a right hand that held a ball and his gloved left hand to clap before his lone 1-2-3 frame.\n\u201cGot a great, long career of him,\u201d Nimmo said. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely nice kid.\u201d\nHe and his defenders were dented in his final frame, in which one run scored cleanly \u2014 a single, wild pitch and RBI single \u2014 before sloppiness ensued. Back-to-back misplays from Francisco Lindor and Pete Alonso led to an unearned run, and two more came in when Otto Lopez dropped a single into center.\nBut with the crowd begging for a strikeout with his 97th and final pitch of the game, Tong unleashed a four-seamer a touch low but could strut back to the dugout, the final call as friendly as the environs.\n\u201cI really couldn\u2019t hear myself talk, which was a new one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fans were amazing.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The New York Mets have overhauled their bullpen by acquiring two high\u2011profile relievers, Ryan Helsley and Tyler Rogers, in a bid to solidify late\u2011inning defense and boost postseason prospects. Helsley, who has struggled with pitch\u2011tipping, reported a hand\u2011position adjustment that helped him deliver a scoreless sixth in a 19\u20119 win over the Marlins. The Mets\u2019 front office and manager emphasize the new bullpen\u2019s diverse arm styles as a key to outlasting opponents, while rookie starter Jonah Tong\u2019s dominant debut added to the team's optimism. Overall, the moves signal a strategic shift toward a stronger relief corps to support the Mets\u2019 playoff ambitions.",
