  "content": "Workers install a platform for a up-coming basketball games event by Chinese sports brand Li Ning at the capital popular commercial district, in Beijing, Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2025.\n\nChina\u2019s economy showed signs of slowing in July as factory output and retail sales slowed and housing prices dropped further, according to data released Friday.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs on exports to the United States is still looming over the world\u2019s second-largest economy after President Donald Trump extended a pause in sharp hikes in import duties for 90 days, beginning Monday, following a 90-day pause that began in May.\n\nAs officials worked toward a broader trade agreement, China reported earlier that its exports surged 7.2% in July year-on-year, while its imports grew at the fastest pace in a year, as businesses rushed to take advantage of the truce in Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing.\n\nBut that also reflected a lower base for comparison, and manufacturers have slowed investments, hiring and production as they watch to see what comes. Chinese manufacturers also have ramped up shipments to Southeast Asia, Africa and other regions to help offset lost business in the U.S.\n\n\u201cExports remained a bright spot although the boost from front-loading appears to be tapering off and has started to show up in weak industrial production, as we anticipated,\u201d Oxford Economics\u2019 Sheana Yue wrote in a report.\n\nChina also has been enduring flooding from torrential seasonal rains that have disrupted business activity in many parts of the country\n\nThe statistics bureau\u2019s report said the economy had shown \u201cnotable resilience and vitality against the complex and volatile external environment and adverse impacts from extreme domestic weather.\u201d\n\nAnnual growth in industrial output slowed to 5.7% in July from 6.8% in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said. That was an 8-month low.\n\nInvestments in factory equipment and other fixed assets rose a meager 1.6% in January-July, compared with 2.8% growth in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cChinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year,\u201d Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a report.\n\nProperty investments plunged 12% in the first seven months of the year, with residential housing investment dropping nearly 11%.\n\nPrices for newly built housing in major cities fell 1.1%, as a prolonged downturn in the property industry lingered.\n\nYue of Oxford Economics said prices could continue to fall before stabilizing in 2028.\n\nThe meltdown in the housing market hit just as the COVID -19 pandemic began, sapping one of the economy\u2019s main drivers of growth and causing dozens of developers to default on their debts.\n\nThe crisis rippled throughout the economy, destroying jobs for millions of people.\n\nThe government has sought to ensure that most housing that was paid for gets built, but sales remain weak despite a series of moves meant to entice families into back into the market.\n\nSince most Chinese families have their wealth tied up in property, the anemic housing market has been a major factor crimping consumer spending. In July, retail sales rose 3.7%, the slowest rate in seven months and down from a 4.8% increase in June.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 5.2% from 5% as university graduates began looking for work.\n\nWhile consumer prices rose 0.4% in July from the month before, prices at the wholesale level slipped 3.6% from a year earlier in another indicator of relatively weak demand.\n\nKurtenbach writes for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Retail sales rose 0.5% in July as some shoppers stepped up purchases ahead of tariffs\n- Share via\nNEW YORK \u2014 Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation\u2019s auto dealerships, even as President Trump\u2019s tariffs start to take a toll on jobs and lead to some price increases.\nBut the figures also underscore anxiety among Americans: All the uncertainty around the expansive duties appears to be pushing them to step up their purchases of furniture and other items ahead of the expected price increases, analysts said.\nRetail sales rose a solid 0.5% last month from the previous month, and June spending was stronger than expected, according to the Commerce Department\u2019s report released Friday. June\u2019s retail sales were revised upward to 0.9% from the original 0.6% increase, the agency said. The pace in July matched economists\u2019 estimates.\nThe increases followed two consecutive months of spending declines in April and May.\nExcluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cars, retail sales rose 0.3% in July.\nAuto sales rose 1.6%. They appear to have returned roughly to normalized spending after a surge in March and April as Americans attempted to get ahead of Trump\u2019s 25% duty on imported cars and parts and then a slump after that, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\nThe data showed solid spending across various stores. Business at clothing stores and online retailers saw increases. Business at home furnishings and furniture stores had strong sales gains.\nHowever, at electronics stores, sales were down. And business at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, also fell, as shoppers ate at home to save money.\nA category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019 consumption estimate and is a sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items.\nTuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, noted the difficulty of attributing the entire July gain to resilient American shoppers given so much uncertainty surrounding the economy and tariffs. A sizable portion of the gain likely came from rising prices of imported goods under the impact of tariffs, he said.\nNguyen also noted he can\u2019t dismiss the possibility that consumers once again pulled forward their spending ahead of the August tariff deadline, taking advantage of Amazon Prime Day sales as well as competing sales from the likes of Walmart and Target.\nIn fact, Nguyen noted the sharp rise in furniture sales, for example, appeared to indicate shoppers were trying to get ahead of the duties.\n\u201cThere is nothing fundamentally wrong with American households that would suggest a spending recession given that shoppers are in a strong enough financial position to accelerate purchases,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith so much noise in the data, the rest of the year promises to be a wild and bumpy ride.\u201d\nEarlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. hiring is slowing sharply as Trump\u2019s trade policies paralyze businesses and raise concerns about the outlook for the world\u2019s largest economy. U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported, well short of the 115,000 expected.\nAnother government report, issued Tuesday, on U.S. inflation showed that inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were offset by declining gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.\nThe new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some effects of Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs.\nMany businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. The consumer price figures likely reflect some effect from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.\nBut that may change. U.S. wholesale inflation soared unexpectedly last month, signaling that Trump\u2019s taxes are pushing costs up and that higher prices for consumers may be on the way.\nThe Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which measures inflation before it hits consumers \u2014 rose 0.9% last month from June, the biggest jump in more than three years.\nThe report comes as major retailers like Walmart and Target are slated to report their fiscal second-quarter earnings reports starting next week. Analysts will study the reports to get insight into the state of consumer behavior. But they will also monitor how much stores are passing on the tariffs\u2019 costs to shoppers.\nIn May, Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, warned that it had increased prices on bananas imported from Costa Rica from 50 cents per pound to 54 cents, but it noted that a large sting for shoppers wouldn\u2019t start to appear until June and July.\nBut a growing list of companies including Procter & Gamble, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren told investors in recent weeks that they plan to or have already raised prices.\nSome are trying to be selective and focusing on raising prices on just their premium products as a way to offset the higher costs from tariffs.\nWarby Parker, which has been shifting its sourcing away from China, told analysts last Thursday that it plans to keep its $95 option. But it\u2019s increasing prices on select lens types. It also wants to cater more to older shoppers who need more expensive progressive lens. Warby Parker said that progressives, trifocals and bifocals make up roughly 40% of all prescription units sold industrywide.\nBut just 23% of Warby Parker\u2019s business now is made up of progressives, its highest priced offering and offer the highest profit margins.\n\u201cWe were able to quickly roll out select strategic price increases that have benefited our growth,\u201d Neil Blumenthal, co-chairman, co-founder and co-CEO of Warby Parker, told analysts last week.\nD\u2019Innocenzio writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "U.S. inflation held steady as mild tariff hit is offset by cheaper gas, food\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\nThe new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some effects of President Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday\u2019s figures probably reflect some effect from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs \u2014 calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports \u2014 has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months.\n\u201cThose cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape or form,\u201d Bethune said. Some companies could return to \u201cshrinkflation,\u201d he added, in which they reduce the package size of a good while keeping the price the same.\nAnd companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said.\nThe Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot.\nHiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced tariffs in April. The stalling-out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank at its next meeting in September, and some Fed officials have raised concerns about the health of the job market. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans.\nEconomists are divided over how Fed officials will read the data in the coming months. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Yet some say that with core inflation notably above 2% and rising, the Fed will postpone that decision.\nChair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines \u2014 a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.\nOn Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. It wasn\u2019t clear what lawsuit he was referring to.\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.\nGas prices fell 2.2% from June to July and have plunged 9.5% from a year earlier, the government\u2019s report said. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago.\nTariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leaped 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier.\nCoffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Nearly all U.S. coffee is imported.\nTuesday\u2019s data arrives at a highly charged moment for the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.\nThe president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.\nAdding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, will still be reliable.\nSmaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds.\nClothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. The company has joined a lawsuit seeking to block the duties. Rebecca Melsky, chief executive and co-founder of the firm, says it is prohibitively expensive to make the cotton-blend fabrics it uses in the United States.\nFor now, the company has instituted a \u201ctip jar\u201d on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods.\n\u201cWe have not across the board raised prices because of the tariffs \u2014 yet,\u201d she said.\nTrump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven\u2019t fallen much since the levies were put in place.\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall, consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth.\nMany large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren\u2019t in place for Tuesday\u2019s inflation report.\nConsumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Walmart has also raised prices.\nCosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.\nRugaber writes for the Associated Press. AP retail writer Anne D\u2019Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report."

      "text": "U.S. producer prices surge in July as Trump tariffs push costs higher\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. wholesale inflation surged unexpectedly last month, signaling that President Trump\u2019s sweeping taxes on imports are pushing costs up and that higher prices for consumers may be on the way.\nThe Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which measures inflation before it hits consumers \u2014 rose 0.9% last month from June, biggest jump in more than three years. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices rose 3.3%.\nThe numbers were much higher than economists had expected.\nPrices rose faster for producers than consumers last month, suggesting that U.S. importers may, for now, be eating the cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs rather than passing them on to customers.\nThat may not last.\n\u201cIt will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs onto the backs of inflation-weary consumers,\u201d wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at fwdbonds, a financial markets research firm.\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core producer prices rose 0.9% from June, biggest month-over-month jump since March 2022. Compared with a year ago, core wholesale prices rose 3.7% after posting a 2.6% year-over-year jump in June.\nWholesale food prices rose 1.4% from June, led by a 38.9% surge in vegetable prices. The price of home electronic equipment gained 5% from June. Both are heavily imported in the U.S.\nBut some aspects of Thursday\u2019s producer price report were puzzling, including a big jump in profit margins at retailers and wholesalers. Economist Stephen Brown at Capital Economics found the increase \u201cto put it lightly, counterintuitive given the anecdotal evidence that firms are absorbing the lion\u2019s share of tariff increases in margins.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s tariffs have generated considerable uncertainty about the U.S. economy, the world\u2019s largest, which could explain some seemingly contradictory trends. Trump has negotiated trade agreements with several major U.S. trading partners, including the European Union and Japan. But the details have not been published, leaving businesses uncertain about where tariff rates will end up and therefore whether and how they should adjust their own prices.\nThe fallout from the tariffs has also been delayed because many importers stockpiled products before the taxes took effect. Those inventories are diminishing, however.\nWhat\u2019s more, the U.S. courts are hearing a challenge to Trump\u2019s most sweeping tariffs and could strike them down.\nThe wholesale inflation report two days after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 2.7% last month from July 2024, same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Core consumer prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\nThe new consumer price numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are partly offsetting the impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties instead of passing them along to customers via higher prices.\nThe producer and consumer inflation numbers are both issued by the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is already in Trump crosshairs.\nAfter the BLS issued a disappointing jobs report for July, Trump fired the director of the BLS, groundlessly accusing the bureau of rigging the numbers for political reasons. Trump then nominated a partisan idealogue to replace her, raising fears of political interference in economic data that investors, policymakers, businesses and the Federal Reserve rely on to make decisions.\nThursday\u2019s report is likely to complicate decisions for the Fed. After an ominous July jobs report \u2013 which also showed that hiring was much weaker than originally reported in May and June \u2014 the central bank was widely expected to cut interest rates at its meeting next month in a bid to recharge hiring.\nThe Fed has drawn Trump\u2019s ire for not cutting interest rates already. Under Chair Jerome Powell, it had been delaying rate cuts until better understood the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation. \u201cThis report is a strong validation of the Fed\u2019s wait-and-see stance on policy changes,\u2019\u2019 Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a commentary Thursday. \u201cIt will mean a markdown of market expectations for a September rate cut.\u2019\u2019\nWholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably measures of health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.\nThe PCE inflation numbers for July are due out Aug. 29.\nWiseman writes for the Associated Press."

Exports rose 7.2% year\u2011on\u2011year, but the boost is tapering as manufacturers cut investment and production amid tariff uncertainty. In the United States, retail sales edged up 0.5% in July as shoppers accelerated purchases ahead of new tariffs, while consumer inflation held steady at 2.7% and wholesale prices surged, signaling that tariff costs are beginning to filter into prices.
