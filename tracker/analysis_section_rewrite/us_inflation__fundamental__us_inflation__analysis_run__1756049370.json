      "feedback": "The draft ambitiously ties a multi‑year, AI‑driven productivity regime to market pricing, but it reads more as a narrative than a rigorously defined, testable framework; to reach world‑class standards you should (a) replace the single narrative with a formal horizon, regime‑based structure (e.g., three regimes: (i) productivity‑driven expansion with manageable displacement, (ii) displacement‑dominant adjustment, (iii) stabilization with policy cushioning) and specify transition conditions (e.g., a credible uptick in automation exposure from Brookings’ ~25% high‑exposure jobs, or a regime shift when unemployment or underemployment exceeds a threshold); (b) anchor the analysis in first‑principles and invariant anchors relevant to SECTION FOCUS—productivity/investment dynamics, real rate/term‑of‑trade considerations, and policy reaction functions—while clearly stating the invariants and the regimes that can shift them; (c) articulate a crisp causal chain from AI productivity to market pricing (AI/TFP increment drives capex, margins, and durable goods demand, which then informs wage dynamics and inflation/real rates, feeding into asset prices and risk premia), with explicit linkages to labor supply, wage formation, and demand channels rather than relying on generic “transmission through labor”; (d) quantify the base case using concrete numbers in the sources (Ford’s Q2 EV losses of about $1.3B, 5.18% dividend yield, ~10.3 forward P/E; UNH/LULU specifics from IGP1Q4ZEJ; Morningstar’s ~3.7% safe withdrawal and Morningstar guidance; the Finnish UBI outcome; the 25% exposure figure from Brookings in NL5YYTLF2); (e) build explicit catalysts/triggers and invalidation rules: AI adoption pace, tariff/policy changes (Mark Cuban’s tariff angle from YVQU6QCY4), earnings trajectories of key firms (Ford, UNH, LULU in IGP1Q4ZEJ), and a clear “invalidation” stress test (e.g., a sustained inflation shock or a policy pivot that dramatically reduces fiscal space); (f) separate data vs opinion more clearly (NL5YYTLF2 is opinion‑leaning on identity effects; treat such claims as qualitative inputs with caveats), and ensure the conclusion remains disciplined about uncertainties; (g) strengthen the corporate‑finance lens by explicitly weighing ROIC vs. WACC when discussing capex signaling (draw on the ROIC article in 6 and Walmart example) and calibrate the implied return regime to discount rates; (h) tighten source mapping so each factual claim is tethered to a source ID and reconcile conflicts (e.g., the disinflationary productivity impulse vs. tariff‑driven price pressure from  YVQU6QCY4 and the Mark Cuban piece); (i) improve structure and readability under SECTION FOCUS by delivering a base‑case paragraph followed by a short list of watch items, then a compact set of risk scenarios and a confidence rating; (j) format and quantify “what to watch” (labor share, unemployment, EV profitability, healthcare/longevity costs, UBI policy developments, tariff pass‑through, and ROIC/WACC gaps) so the piece can be scanned quickly by a reader. Map each claim to the IDs NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, IGP1Q4ZEJ, YVQU6QCY4, and 11, and include a brief note where numbers originate. This will yield a true multi‑year, regime‑based, first‑principles framework with explicit catalysts, invalidation checks, and a transparent, data‑driven base case plus clearly delineated risks.",
