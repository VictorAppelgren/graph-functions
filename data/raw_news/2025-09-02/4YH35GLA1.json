  "title": "What To Expect From Friday's Jobs Report",
  "description": "With the economy at a turning point, Friday's report on job creation will attract even more attention than usual. Forecasters expect it to show August was lackluster for job growth.",
  "content": "\u2022 A government report released Friday could show August was another lackluster month for job growth. Economists expect U.S. employers added just 75,000 jobs during that time.\n\u2022 Anything less than a surprising surge in job growth could reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September to boost the job market and prevent a surge of unemployment.\n\u2022 Reports on the job market from private companies could get extra attention this month after last month's report spurred questions about the quality and reliability of government data.\n\n\n\nThe job market continued to sputter along in its recent low-hiring, low-firing limbo, if forecasts are on target.\n\n\n\nEconomists predict that a report on Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will show the economy continuing its recent trend of relatively low job growth. Employers likely added 75,000 jobs in August, a slight uptick from the anemic 73,000 added in July, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThey also expect the unemployment rate to tick to 4.3%, slightly higher than the prior month's 4.2% level.\n\n\n\nFriday's jobs report comes at a crucial time for the economy and the outlook for interest rates. The July edition caused economic and political shockwaves by showing a sharp slowdown in job growth and steep downward revisions to job growth estimates for May and June. The August report could shed fresh light on how much President Donald Trump's tariffs are dragging down the hiring market and the overall economy.\n\n\n\nThe report could also be pivotal for the Federal Reserve, which will use the data to decide whether to cut interest rates at the central bank's next policy committee meeting in September. Fed officials have said they're considering lowering interest rates out of concern that tariffs are slowing hiring and could cause a severe increase in unemployment. A lower federal funds rate could lower borrowing costs and boost the job market.\n\n\n\nAlthough job growth has been relatively slow compared to previous years, the unemployment rate has stayed low, with some economists saying the workforce is growing more slowly because of Trump's crackdown on immigration.\n\n\n\nFinancial markets currently widely expect the Fed to cut the Fed funds rate from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. But that expectation could change if the job market rebounds and inflation worsens.\n\n\n\nHowever, that may be a high bar to clear. An addition of 225,000 jobs in August would likely be enough job growth to ease the Fed's concerns about the labor market and push policymakers to keep interest rates high, Michael T. Gapen, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a commentary. That would be the fastest job growth since December 2024.\n\n\n\nFed officials have been caught between their two-sided objective, given to them by Congress, of keeping inflation low and employment high. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested in a major policy speech this month that the job market was becoming more of a concern than it had been earlier this year.",

May\u2019s job gains now stand at 19,000, down from the originally reported 144,000, while the June jobs number shrank to just 14,000 from 147,000.\n\u201cThe numbers today, and the revisions in an important way, suggest that maybe the economy and the labor market are weakening more broadly,\u201d Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostic said on CNBC after the report\u2019s release.\nThe Dow and the S&P are each down well over 1% after the weak report and Trump's overnight move to hike tariffs on dozens of countries.\nWeak Report Puts More Pressure on Fed to Cut Rates\nThe latest jobs numbers are likely to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates. The central bank earlier this week left its key rate unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials need to see more data on how tariffs are affecting inflation before adjusting rates.\nSome economists have already said that the jobs numbers have them considering rate cuts. \u201c[The data] suggest that the risks to the employment side of the mandate may be coming more into balance with those of inflation, and that's something that I'll really have to look at as I think about the appropriate path for policy,\u201d Bostic said.\nPresident Donald Trump ramped up the pressure with a post targeting Powell on Truth Social shortly after the report\u2019s release.\n\u201cToo Little, Too Late. Jerome \u2018Too Late\u2019 Powell is a disaster. DROP THE RATE!\u201d Trump wrote.\nEconomists, Investors See the Fed Moving Towards Rate Cuts\nEconomists expect the weak jobs data to push the Fed towards a rate cut at its September meeting, even as inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\u201cThis is a gamechanger jobs report. The labor market is deteriorating quickly,\u201d said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \u201cThe Federal Reserve needs to seriously consider a September rate cut. It\u2019s clear companies are not hiring at all in this environment of uncertainty.\u201d\nInvestors also quickly adjusted their expectations. The CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool now shows that traders have priced in a 82% chance for a rate cut in September. That's up from a 37% probability from before Friday\u2019s release of the jobs data.\nAfter Months of Warnings, the Storm Hits\nJob creation has slowed in recent months, and job openings declined in June. Employers have stayed in low-hiring, low-firing limbo as tariffs and high interest rates weigh on the economy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally in the eye of the hurricane. After months of warning signs, the July jobs report confirms that the slowdown isn\u2019t just approaching\u2014it\u2019s here,\u201d said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at employment website Glassdoor."

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Sharply reduced immigration could hurt the U.S. economy, which has become more reliant on foreign-born labor in recent decades, economists said.\n- Immigration has slowed sharply and could even turn negative according to several recent economic analyses.\n- President Donald Trump acknowledge his policies were hurting farms and restaurants, and reportedly has ordered ICE to halt raids at those businesses at least temporarily.\nPresident Donald Trump's policies could recreate a shortage that hurt the economy during the pandemic and its aftermath: that of labor.\nTrump's crackdown on immigration since January has driven down the number of people entering the U.S. to work, and could even send the flow of immigrants into the negative for the first time in decades, according to several recent analyses by economists. That could lead to labor shortages, especially in industries like construction and agriculture, where immigrants, both legal and otherwise, do a large percentage of the work.\n\"The hiring challenges that seemed like an anomaly following the pandemic and even in the late 2010s could increasingly feel like the norm,\" Sarah House and Nicole Servi, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a commentary.\nThe analyses shed light on the economic impact of Trump's immigration policies, which include more enforcement of border crossings, travel bans, restrictions on foreign students at American universities, highly publicized deportations, and ICE raids on worksites to round up laborers.\nThe spending bill passed by Republicans in the House of Representatives would give the Trump administration more resources to carry out those policies, quintupling spending on immigration enforcement to $185 billion, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute think tank.\nData Shows Immigration Downturn\nThe foreign-born workforce is already dwindling, according to Wells Fargo's analysis of survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The foreign-born workforce shrank by an average of 150,000 people each month in the last four months, compared to an increase of 186,000 per month at the same time last year.\nThat's significant because immigrants have become increasingly important to the economy in recent decades. Immigrants, both legal and illegal, make up 19% of the workforce, up from 11% in the late 90s, according to the Wells Fargo analysis. As the native-born population has aged, employers have increasingly relied on immigrants, who tend to be younger, to fill jobs: 36% of native-born people were aged 25-54, compared to 55% of immigrants.\nOther experts believe Trump's immigration policies will have an even more profound effect on the labor force. The U.S. could actually see more immigrants leave the country than enter it this year, according to a forthcoming paper by economists at the centrist Brookings Institution think tank, the Washington Post reported Monday. That would be the first time the U.S. experienced net negative immigration in 50 years.\nA return to pandemic-like labor shortages could seriously impact the economy. At the height of worker shortages in mid-2022, employers had a hard time filling positions, with more than two open jobs for every unemployed worker, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That ratio has since fallen to 1.2 to 1, thanks partly to the immigrant surge during the Biden administration.\nA serious reduction in immigrant labor would result in \"sharp increases in the prices of food and housing, tamping down households\u2019 purchasing power,\" researchers led by Celine McNicholas, director of policy and government affairs at the EPI, wrote in April.\nTrump's Turnaround\nTrump himself seemingly acknowledged some of those risks last week when he said \"changes are coming\" to his immigration policies.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement had been directed to temporarily halt raids at farms, restaurants, and hotels, CBS reported over the weekend, citing unnamed sources.\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump posted on social media last week."

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door for the central bank to cut interest rates in September, but stopped short of indicating it's a sure thing.\n- With risks of a job market downturn rising, central bank policymakers \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" Powell said in a major policy speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n- The Fed has kept rates high to fight inflation, which is still rising further from the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate, but Powell said the risks to the job market may require the Fed to cut rates anyway.\nLower interest rates are looking a lot more likely, though still not a sure thing.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank may cut the federal funds rate when its policy committee next meets in September. The growing risks of a serious job market downturn may require the Federal Reserve to change its current monetary policy, which has kept rates high to discourage borrowing and fight inflation, Powell said speaking in a major policy address at the Jackson Hole economic symposium Friday.\n\"With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" Powell said.\nPowell's highly anticipated speech focused on how President Donald Trump's trade wars, especially his sweeping import taxes, are affecting the economy and setting back the Fed on both sides of its \"dual mandate\" to keep inflation low and employment high. Powell highlighted recent data showing employers are cutting back on hiring due to the tariffs, a trend that could easily sour into mass layoffs.\n\"Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\" Powell said. \"This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\"\nAt the same time, Powell noted the tariffs are pushing up prices. That could be a short-lived trend, but could also set off a bout of high inflation at a time when prices are still increasing faster than the Fed's target of a 2% annual rate, Powell said.\n\"The upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Powell said the weak job market made it unlikely that the tariffs would set off an inflation spiral in which workers kept demanding higher wages to keep up with increasing living costs, like what happened in the 1970s.\nPowell acknowledged the difficulty the Fed faces in setting monetary policy at a time when its \"dual mandate\" is pulling it in opposite directions: high inflation typically requires the Fed to keep interest rates high, while a job market slowdown would push it to lower rates. The fed funds rate influences interest rates on all kinds of loans.\n\"In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside\u2014a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate,\" Powell said.\nFinancial markets interpreted Powell's speech as opening the door to cutting interest rates in September. Investors were pricing in a 91.5% chance of a September rate cut after Powell's speech, up from 75% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data.\n\"Fed Chair Powell's comments at Jackson Hole were more dovish than we and markets were expecting,\" wrote Bank of America Securities analysts.\nUpdate, Aug. 23, 2025: This article has been updated to include analyst comments."

      "text": "The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions (mainly banks) lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis. In simpler terms, it's the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans to meet their reserve requirements.\nThe federal funds rate is a cornerstone of U.S. monetary policy and a key driver of economic activity. It refers to the target interest rate range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System.\nFOMC's decisions about the federal funds rate have far-reaching economic consequences, and they're one of the few major market indicators widely followed by the nonfinancial press. For instance, when the Federal Reserve cut its influential fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% on Dec. 18, 2024, it warranted major news coverage across the U.S.\nIt marked the first rate cut in over four years and signaled a shift in strategy aimed at bolstering the economy and preventing a rise in unemployment. Such changes in the federal funds rate can impact everything from mortgage and credit card interest rates to business investments and the stock market. Below, we discuss why.\nKey Takeaways\n- The federal funds rate is the target interest rate range set by the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- This is the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight.\n- The FOMC sets the target federal funds rate eight times a year, based on prevailing economic conditions.\n- The federal funds rate can influence short-term rates on consumer loans and credit cards.\n- Investors monitor the federal funds rate because it has an impact on the stock market.\nUnderstanding the Federal Funds Rate\nThe federal funds rate refers to the interest rate that banks charge other institutions for lending excess cash to them from their reserve balances overnight.\nBy law, banks must maintain a reserve equal to a certain percentage of their deposits in an account at a Federal Reserve bank. The amount of money a bank must keep in its Fed account is known as a reserve requirement and is based on a percentage of the bank's total deposits.\nFinancial institutions are required to maintain interest-bearing accounts at Federal Reserve banks to ensure they have enough money to cover depositors' withdrawals and other obligations. Any money in their reserve that exceeds the required level is available for lending to other banks that might have a shortfall.\nFast Fact\nOn Dec. 18, 2024, the FOMC announced that it would cut its target range by a quarter of a percentage point from 4.25% to 4.50%. This was the third cut after two years of rate increases as it fought post-pandemic inflation.\nThe end-of-the-day balances in the bank's account averaged over two-week reserve maintenance periods are used to determine whether it meets its reserve requirements. If a bank expects to have end-of-the-day balances greater than what's required, it can lend the excess to an institution that anticipates a shortfall in its balances. The interest rate the lending bank can charge is the federal funds rate, or fed funds rate.\nThe FOMC makes its decisions about rate adjustments based on key economic indicators that may show signs of inflation, recession, or other issues that can affect sustainable economic growth. The indicators can include measures like the core inflation rate and the durable goods orders report.\nHow the Federal Funds Rate Is Adjusted\nThe FOMC meets eight times a year to set the target federal funds rate range as part of its monetary policy. The committee uses various tools to push the effective federal funds rate into that target range. This rate serves as a benchmark for many other interest rates in the economy and is used to help promote economic growth.\nThe Fed adjusts the federal funds rate in response to economic conditions:\nLowering the rate: When the Fed wants to stimulate economic growth or prevent unemployment from rising, it lowers the target federal funds rate. This makes borrowing cheaper throughout the economy, encouraging spending and investment.\nRaising the rate: Conversely, when the Fed wants to cool down an overheating economy or combat inflation, it raises the target rate, making borrowing more expensive and encouraging saving.\nHolding steady: In periods of economic stability, the Fed may choose to keep the rate unchanged for extended periods.\nThese decisions are closely watched by markets and can have significant impacts on various sectors of the economy.\nHistorical Policy Shifts\nThe federal funds rate has fluctuated significantly over time, reflecting changing economic conditions and policy approaches. The magnitude of rate changes can vary. While 25 basis point adjustments are standard, the Fed may opt for more significant changes (such as 50 basis points or more) if it believes more dramatic action is needed to influence economic conditions.\nFor instance, following the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed kept rates near zero for several years to stimulate economic recovery. In contrast, periods of high inflation have seen the Fed raise rates aggressively to cool the economy.\nThe target for the federal funds rate has varied widely over the years in response to the prevailing economic conditions. It was set as high as 20% in the early 1980s in response to inflation. With the coming of the Great Recession, the rate was slashed to a record-low target of 0% to 0.25% in an attempt to encourage growth.\nIn March 2020, the target rate was between 0% and 0.25%. In 2022, to combat inflation, the Fed started raising its rate slowly, a process that continued into 2024.\nThe FOMC increased the target fed funds rate to a range of 5.25% and 5.5% in July 2023. It maintained this range during subsequent meetings and confirmed the range in its June 2024 meeting.\nOn Sept. 18, 2024, the committee announced that it would cut its target range by half a percentage point to 4.75% to 5%, citing the \"progress on inflation and the balance of risks.\" It said it will continue to reduce its Treasury security holds, agency debt, and mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBSs).\nThe committee then again cut rates in November 2024 by a quarter of a percentage point, and again in December 2024 to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%.\nImpact of the Fed Funds Rate\nThe federal funds rate is one of the most important interest rates in the U.S. economy. That's because it impacts monetary and financial conditions, which in turn have a bearing on critical aspects of the broader economy, including employment, growth, and inflation.\nThe rate also influences short-term interest rates, albeit indirectly, for everything from home and auto loans to credit cards, as lenders often set their rates based on the prime lending rate. The prime rate is the rate banks charge their most creditworthy borrowers\u2014a rate that is also influenced by the federal funds rate.\nInvestors keep a close watch on the federal funds rate. The stock market typically reacts very strongly to changes in the target rate.\nFor example, a small decline in the rate can prompt the market to leap higher as the borrowing costs for companies get lower. Many stock analysts pay particular attention to statements by members of the FOMC to try to get a sense of where the target rate may be headed.\nSectors Affected by the Federal Funds Rate\nThe federal funds rate has far-reaching effects across various sectors of the economy:\n- Automotive industry: Car loan rates typically follow trends in the federal funds rate, impacting vehicle sales.\n- Banking: Banks use this rate as a basis for setting interest rates on loans and savings accounts, thus impacting the rest of the list here.\n- Consumer lending: Credit card rates and personal loan rates are influenced by changes in the federal funds rate.\n- Corporate investments: Lower rates spur business expansion and capital investments, while higher rates generally curb such activities.\n- Foreign exchange: Rate changes can affect the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, impacting international trade and investment.\n- Government finance: The rate influences the cost of government borrowing and can affect budget deficits.\n- Real estate: Mortgage rates often move in tandem with the federal funds rate, affecting home buying and refinancing activity. It's a major reason the Fed Funds rate makes national news headlines.\n- Financial markets: Changes in the federal funds rate can affect stock prices since it affects corporate profits and investor behavior.\nHow Does the Federal Funds Rate Work?\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow or lend excess reserves overnight. The law requires that banks must have a minimum reserve level in proportion to their deposits. This reserve requirement is held at a Federal Reserve bank. When a bank has excess reserve requirements, it may lend these funds overnight to other banks that have realized a reserve deficit.\nHow Is the Federal Funds Rate Determined?\nIt is customary for the Federal Open Market Committee to meet eight times annually to determine the federal funds rate. These rates are influenced by economic indicators, such as the core inflation rate and the durable goods orders report, which provide signals about the economic health of the country.\nWhat Is the Difference Between the Federal Funds and Regular Interest Rates?\nBoth the federal funds rate and interest rates are some of the most important financial indicators in the U.S. The chief distinction is that the federal funds rate sets the range that banks will lend or borrow to each other overnight. Because this impacts borrowing costs and financial conditions, stock markets are typically sensitive to changes in these rates. The federal funds rate also indirectly affects short-term interest rates. Conversely, interest rates, which are set by the Federal Reserve, determine the rate that it costs for banks to borrow.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe federal funds rate is used by the Fed to control monetary policy and is watched closely by investors to gauge how the market may move in the future. The rate is one of the most important pieces of financial data in the U.S.\nIt's the interest rate at which depository institutions (mainly banks) lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis. In simpler terms, it's the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans to meet their reserve requirements."
