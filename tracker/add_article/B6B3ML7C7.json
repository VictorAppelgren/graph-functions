      "summary": "President Trump is pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates this year, but Powell—11 months from the end of his term—will likely prioritize preserving the Fed’s independence and legacy, making rate cuts unlikely. Trump’s public insults and potential early announcement of a successor may backfire, reinforcing Powell’s resistance to political pressure. Market expectations remain that the Fed will keep rates steady at its July meeting, with a 79% probability of no significant cuts.",
