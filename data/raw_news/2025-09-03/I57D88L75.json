  "title": "Will Taylor Swift Be The Super Bowl LX Performer? Goodell Says Maybe.",
  "description": "Mentions of sourdough bread and references to the numbers 60, 47 and 1973 have fans convinced Taylor Swift is the NFL's next big performer.",
  "content": "Goodell said the NFL would \u201calways love to have Taylor play,\u201d but said he couldn't reveal any details about the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, which is being produced by Jay-Z's company Roc Nation. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything about it,\u201d Goodell told \"Today\" host Savannah Guthrie after she asked if a Swift peformance was in the works, adding, \"She is a special, special talent, and obviously she would be welcome at any time.\" Swift, who announced the track list and release date for her new album in a two-hour podcast appearance last month, made several comments that convinced fans she\u2019d be the star of the Super Bowl LX halftime show. Swift shared details on her \u201cgranny\u201d hobbies like sewing purses and baby blankets, painting and her \u201cvery deep\u201d sourdough obsession, and fans quickly noticed that this year\u2019s NFL championship game is set to be played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, where Sourdough Sam is the mascot of the home team (the San Francisco 49ers). Swift also said she\u2019s \u201creally talking about bread 60% of the time now,\u201d and fans connected that the 2026 Super Bowl will be the 60th rendition of the event. At the start of the podcast, co-host Jason Kelce introduced Swift using an impassioned intro listing her accolades and she responded, \u201cthank you for screaming for 47 seconds for me.\u201dLevi Stadium was the 47th stop on her record-breaking Eras Tour. Swift also said, \u201cThat's how it works in 1973!\" when telling a story on the podcast, and fans noticed Superbowl VII was that year (she\u2019s currently promoting the release of her 12th album) and that the Miami Dolphins, who use orange as a team color, played in the game that year (each of Swift's albums has a color associated with it, and her upcoming \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d and its album cycle are orange-themed).\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nSwift is famous for her habit of teasing fans with clues and Easter eggs hidden in her social media posts, music videos, interviews and other releases. In 2019, she admitted she\u2019s \u201ctrained\u201d her fans to scour her every move for clues, and on \u201cNew Heights\u201d she talked more about the habit: \"I have parameters. There\u2019s dos and donts. I don\u2019t do an Easter egg that ties to my personal life. It points to my music\u2026it\u2019s something you don\u2019t know why I\u2019m saying for a specific reason, but then you\u2019ll look back and go 'oh my god.'\" She went on to cite the commencement speech she gave while receiving an honorary doctorate at New York University in 2022, saying,\u201dI put so many lyrical easter eggs in that speech that when the \u2018Midnights\u2019 album came out after that, the fans were like 'The whole speech was an easter egg.' And that for me is really fun because they find it fun. I love numerology, I love math stuff, I love dates, that stuff I find really fun.\"\n\nSwift\u2019s propensity to tease has also caused fans to generate wild theories that aren\u2019t true. There was a fan rumor in 2024 that Swift was the true author of the novel that inspired the spy movie \"Argylle\" before Matthew Vaughn, director of the film, shut down the idea. \u201cAnd there is an Elly Conway who wrote the book, but it\u2019s not Taylor Swift,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"I did read the conspiracies, and I was like, Wow, they don\u2019t leave a stone unturned! But it\u2019s not Taylor Swift. She definitely didn\u2019t write the book.\u201d Earlier this year, fans became convinced Swift was going to attend the American Music Awards and announce the long-awaited re-recorded version of her 2017 album \u201cReputation\u201d at the event, but she did not attend and the re-record has still not been announced. Fans' \"Woodvale\" theory, suggesting a third Folklore sister album, has not come to fruition and the \"Karma\" album theory, suggesting a lost album between \"1989\" and \"Reputation,\" has also been largely debunked.\n\nThe 2026 Super Bowl performer has not been announced, but there are several theories as to who it may be. Some have suggested Jay-Z could headline the Super Bowl 60 halftime show\u2014Roc Nation has been producing the halftime show since Super Bowl 54\u2014but other rumors have said he\u2019s under pressure to choose a female artist \"outside of the hip-hop world.\u201d His wife, Beyonc\u00e9, has reportedly been ruled out as a possibility. Sportsbook Review, a betting analysis website, recently reported Swift is the odds-on favorite to perform, followed by Metallica, Post Malone, Jay-Z, Morgan Wallen, Miley Cyrus and Sabrina Carpenter.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe NFL typically announces the Super Bowl halftime performer in the fall. Last year, the announcement was made in September.",

      "text": "Taylor Swift is one of the lucky few artists who have scored a hit with a song that, for one reason or another, becomes an annual sensation. Most musicians who fit into this club do so thanks to holiday tunes, as Christmas music is massively popular at the end of every year in America. Swift has released tracks that celebrate the jolliest day of the year, but it\u2019s in the summer that the singer-songwriter returns to the Billboard charts with the same cut over and over again.\n\u201cAugust\u201d Reenters the Top 10 on Two Charts\nSwift\u2019s \u201cAugust\u201d reappears on four Billboard rankings this frame. The track reenters the top 10 on both the Alternative Digital Song Sales and Alternative Streaming Songs charts, coming in at Nos. 7 and 9, respectively.\nThe same tune finds its way to both worldwide rosters as it settles at No. 50 on the Billboard Global 200 and No. 59 on the Billboard Global Excluding U.S., after not finding space on either list last time around.\nTaylor Swift\u2019s Song Nears Its All-Time Peaks\n\u201cAugust\u201d has been much more successful in terms of peak positions when it comes to the two alternative rankings, which are U.S.-specific. Swift\u2019s summery tune has reached No. 3 on the Alternative Streaming Songs chart and No. 5 on the Alternative Digital Song Sales roster. \u201cAugust\u201d reappears within a few spaces of its all-time best showing on both global rosters, which is impressive, as it was released many years before Billboard introduced the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excluding U.S.\n\u201cAugust\u201d is an Annual Smash for Taylor Swift\n\u201cAugust\u201d surges in both sales and streams for the obvious reason that it\u2019s finally the track\u2019s namesake month. Fans of the singer love the song throughout the entire year, but return to it in droves as July comes to an end and in the first few days and even week of the month. The consumption of the cut grew considerably, and that activity is reflected on the current Billboard charts.\nFolklore Made \u201cAugust\u201d a Hit\nSwift released \u201cAugust\u201d in July 2020 as one of the tracks on her surprise album Folklore. The tune took her in a different direction from her previous full-length Lover, which was a pure top 40 radio-ready pop full-length, while Folklore focused on a more acoustic, folk and indie sound. While it was never officially pushed as a single from Folklore, \u201cAugust\u201d still managed to reach No. 23 on the Hot 100 and crack the top 10 on various rock and alternative lists."

      "text": "Topline\nDevoted fans of billionaire pop star Taylor Swift, known for planting clues to her upcoming music releases, have developed their latest theory: that Swift may announce the long-awaited re-recorded version of her 2017 album \u201cReputation\u201d at the American Music Awards on Monday night, though it\u2019s unclear whether she will attend.\nKey Facts\nSwifties believe the singer has hidden the number \u201c26\u201d\u2014which they think is a reference to May 26, the date of the American Music Awards\u2014in various places to suggest she may announce new music during the awards ceremony.\nFans have noticed some merchandise on Swift\u2019s website is discounted at 26% off, while the order of links\u2014Apparel, Music, Accessories, Sale\u2014spell out \u201cAMAs.\u201d\nSwifties have crunched the numbers, concluding Swift has posted photos from the \u201cReputation\u201d set of the Eras Tour 26 times, and they noticed her total Instagram post count, 676, is equal to 26 squared.\nLast week, the not-yet-released re-recorded version of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d a song from \u201cReputation,\u201d was included in a trailer for an upcoming episode of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d though the trailer offered no indication of when the song or album would be released.\nSwift is also known for using awards shows to announce her forthcoming releases: She announced \u201cMidnights\u201d at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2022 and \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d at the Grammy Awards in 2024.\nWhen Are The American Music Awards?\nThe American Music Awards air Monday, May 26, at 8 p.m. EDT on CBS and Paramount+. This year\u2019s ceremony is hosted by Jennifer Lopez, who is also slated to perform, with other performers including Janet Jackson, Gwen Stefani, Benson Boone and Ren\u00e9e Rapp. Kendrick Lamar leads the nomination tally with 10, followed by Post Malone with eight. Swift, who has won the most AMAs of all time with 40, has six nominations this year.\nWhy Is Swift Re-Recording Her Albums?\nSwift announced in 2019 she would re-record her first six albums after her former label, Big Machine Records, was purchased by Scooter Braun, a record label executive and former artist manager, giving him the rights to Swift\u2019s master recordings. Swift accused Braun of bullying her and stripping her of the rights to her work, though Braun pushed back and claimed he offered her the opportunity to buy her masters back. Swift began releasing her re-recorded music, subtitled (Taylor\u2019s Version), in 2021, and to date she has re-released four of her first six albums, with only \u201cReputation\u201d and her debut album, \u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d left. All of her re-recorded albums have topped the charts, and they include previously unreleased songs.\nKey Background\nSwift has long teased fans with clues and Easter eggs hidden in her social media posts, CD booklets, music videos and more. In 2017, she said the \u201cwhole video\u201d for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d was an Easter egg, and in 2019, she said she \u201ctrained\u201d her fans to scour her every move for clues. This has caused fans to generate wild theories that aren\u2019t true\u2014like a rumor she wrote the big-budget movie \u201cArgylle\u201d under a pen name, which was false\u2014though in recent years, she has directly challenged fans to unscramble the titles of upcoming songs.\nForbes Valuation\nSwift is the wealthiest woman in music with a net worth of $1.6 billion, according to Forbes estimates. She joined the billionaire ranks in 2023 as the Eras Tour smashed records to become the highest-grossing tour of all time, at more than $2 billion.\nFurther Reading\nHow to watch 2025 American Music Awards: Date, performers, nominees, more (USA Today)"

Most recently, in early August, he called Swift \"woke,\u201d said he \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d her and said she was \"NO LONGER HOT,\" in a post praising actress Sydney Sweeney for being a registered Republican. A Navigator Research poll conducted the week after, from Aug. 7 to 11, reportedly showed Swift's popularity with Republicans has dropped 22% in the last two years. In August 2024, Trump re-shared AI-generated images that falsely indicated Swift had endorsed him for president, stating: \u201cI accept!\u201d After Swift endorsed Harris, Trump told \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a Taylor Swift fan,\u201d and he again criticized Swift in February after the Super Bowl. Swift attended the game to support Kelce and was met with some boos when shown on a jumbotron. \u201cThe only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.\nKey Background\nTaylor Swift's team teased her \"next era\" in a post on Monday and sent fans into a frenzy speculating the singer would soon announce her 12th studio album. The Kelce brothers then teased a \u201cspecial episode with a VERY special guest\u201d premiering Wednesday. She then launched a countdown on her website and announced at 12:12 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, Aug. 12, that \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d is the title of her next project. She revealed the album cover on the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast Wednesday. The album will have 12 songs and Swift said \"it comes from the most infectious, joyful, wild and dramatic place I was at in my life. That effervescence comes through.\" She said she recorded the album in Sweden during breaks of the Eras Tour\u2019s European leg. Her podcast appearance was one of her longest and most candid interviews ever and the live stream of the podcast on YouTube glitched out at the one-hour-and-45-minute mark (it was still streaming live on Spotify during the YouTube glitch). The episode was later posted in full.\nCrucial Quote\n\"Swifties so powerful we broke the internet,\" WNBA star Caitlin Clark wrote in a post on X.\nForbes Valuation\nSwift was ranked as the No. 2,310th richest person in the world as of Thursday with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion. She became a billionaire in October 2023 thanks to the earnings from her Eras Tour and the value of her music catalog and is the musician to make the Forbes billionaire ranking primarily based on her songs and performances. She ranks No. 21 on this. year's list of the richest self-made women in America."

Sportsbooks are giving her as much as a 62% chance of headlining the halftime show following her engagement to Travis Kelce.\nSwift recently appeared on the New Heights podcast - hosted by boyfriend (and Kansas City Chiefs tight end) Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce. She announced her upcoming album, The Life of a Showgirl, on the show, which has led to speculation that she'll leave her usual Super Bowl spot in a luxury suite and take the stage to be the Super Bowl halftime show performer.\nKelce's Chiefs remain among the betting favorites by the Super Bowl odds ahead of the season, as we offer our NFL picks.\nSuper Bowl halftime show performer odds 2026 \ud83c\udfa4\nHere are the favorites to perform the Super Bowl 60 halftime show at Levi's Stadium on Sunday, Feb. 8, according to the prediction market from Kalshi.

She has frequently attended Chiefs games ever since, including this past Super Bowl against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nShe has often been among the betting favorites to perform the Super Bowl halftime show, and has reportedly turned down past invitations to headline the spectacle.\n2026 Super Bowl halftime show performer prediction \ud83c\udfaf\n\ud83d\udc90 Miley Cyrus (4%)\nI've backed Cyrus by the early Super Bowl halftime show odds each of the past two years. While the value has finally disappeared with her opening as a co-favorite to play at Levi's Stadium in 2026 across our best sports betting sites, I'm going to see this through.\nCyrus' new album, Something Beautiful, opened at No. 32 on the Top Streaming Albums chart. The album also opened at No. 2 on the Top Album Sales chart, with 27,000 sales, according to Luminate, and it opened at No. 1 on the Vinyl Albums chart.\nThere's been a run of five straight Super Bowl halftime shows with rappers and/or R&B singers headlining. I expect a break from that pattern in 2026, and our best sports betting sites clearly agree. Post Malone is getting the shortest odds of any \"rapper\" to perform at Levi's Stadium, and his last album was a country record.\nCyrus won Grammy awards in 2024 and 2025. The 32-year-old singer/songwriter's last album, \"Endless Summer Vacation,\" was released in 2023. Dropping another later this year or in early 2026 would make her a prime candidate to perform at Levi's Stadium.\nOne of the big factors that could lead to Miley performing the Super Bowl halftime show is her lengthy list of collaborations, and potential guest stars at Levi's Stadium. Her past collab partners include Dolly Parton, Beyonce, Dua Lipa, Snoop Dogg, and Metallica, with many of those acts contenders to headline the show.\nWhen is Super Bowl 60? \ud83c\udfdf\ufe0f\nSuper Bowl 60 - the championship game of the 2025-26 NFL season - will be played on Sunday, Feb. 8, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., the home of the San Francisco 49ers.\nThe Big Game will feature the winners of the AFC and NFC Championship games.\nWho picks the Super Bowl halftime performer?\nThe NFL works with partner Roc Nation to select the Super Bowl halftime performer(s) and entertainment.\nSuper Bowl halftime performer history\n| Super Bowl | Headliner | Guest(s) | Location |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 59 | Kendrick Lamar | SZA | Caesars Superdome |\n| 58 | Usher | Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris, Sonic Boom of the South | Allegiant Stadium |\n| 57 | Rihanna | None | State Farm Stadium |\n| 56 | Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.\nAs we all know, die-hard Swifties will read double and triple meanings into ev-er-y-thing Taylor Swift does or says or breathes near. It's mostly harmless fun, but one recent rumor has been so buzzy that it required an actual investigation. And, weirdly enough, it turned out to be a little bit real.\nSo, in case you're not terminally online, lemme explain: There's a new spy movie coming out featuring Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill called Argylle, and in the movie, there's an author of spy novels named Elly Conway, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. In real life, the movie is based on a novel, written by a woman named Elly Conway, whom no one seems to have ever seen or met. And since the movie was made before the novel hit shelves (it's not that weird\u2014the rights to buzzy manuscripts are often sold to studios before they get published), a rumor started that Elly Conway was, in fact, not a real person, and perhaps the pen name of someone who, for whatever reason, didn't want their name attached to the book. Like, maybe\u2026Taylor Swift?\nIn the trailer for the movie, a cat that looks an awful lot like Swift's beloved feline Meredith is seen in a backpack carrier that is an awful lot like the one Swift uses in Miss Americana. (The above photo is actually Swift's other cat, Olivia.) And thus a rumor was born. Since, to date, no one has come forward to be like, \u201cHello, I wrote this novel,\u201d the question persisted, and Rolling Stone decided to investigate by asking Matthew Vaughn, director of the upcoming feature.\n\u201cThere is a real book\u2026and it\u2019s a really good book,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cAnd there is an Elly Conway who wrote the book, but it\u2019s not Taylor Swift.\u201d And actually, he has a very respectful reason for not feeding the gossip, even if it would create more excitement for his project. \u201cAnd I say that because I imagine Taylor Swift has a load of people trying to jump on her bandwagon left, right, and center, and I don\u2019t want to be a part of that club,\u201d he added before giving credit to the eagle-eyed, if not necessarily truth-minded, Swifties: \u201cI did read the conspiracies, and I was like, Wow, they don\u2019t leave a stone unturned! But it\u2019s not Taylor Swift. She definitely didn\u2019t write the book.\u201d\nIn fact, it was his daughter who first alerted him to the Swift of it all. \u201cI\u2019m not a big internet guy, and it was actually my daughter who came up to me\u2014this is the power of celebrity and the internet\u2014and said, \u2018You never told me Taylor wrote the book!\u2019\u201d said Vaughn. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking at her going, \u2018What are you talking about, Taylor Swift wrote the book? She didn\u2019t write the book!\u2019 And I was laughing because I was like, \u2018It\u2019s not true! She didn\u2019t write the book!\u2019 But my daughter was convinced of it.\u201d So, thanks, internet, for gaslighting Matthew Vaughn's daughter!\nAnd this is where we have to acknowledge that the rumors weren't entirely off-base: There's a reason the Scottish Fold cat in the movie looks just like Taylor's. \u201cIronically, what she is responsible for is the Scottish Fold,\u201d said Vaughn. \u201cI got home one day, it was Christmas, and I was like, \u2018What the fuck is that noise?\u2019 And I\u2019m running around the house and I hear a noise, and the kids had seen a Taylor Swift documentary [Miss Americana] and there was a Scottish Fold in that, and they\u2019d persuaded my wife, Claudia [Schiffer], to get them the kitten for Christmas. It was bought without my permission and hidden from me.\u201d\nThe cat, named Chip, is, Vaughn insists, the only Swift connection to be found. And yes, he is the one you see in the movie. \u201cThat first day of filming with the cat we had\u2014this actor cat\u2014wasn\u2019t really working out, and I literally went to my daughter\u2019s bedroom, because the cat sleeps with her, and I said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m gonna borrow the cat.\u2019 And she went, \u2018Fine.\u2019 I don\u2019t think she realized it meant for three months. It was odd because he rode to work with me every morning, shared my trailer. But he was great. And he seemed to enjoy it as well. He was a natural. The nepo cat.\u201d\nNeed Chip to meet Meredith ASAP."

  "argos_summary": "Taylor Swift is the leading betting favorite to headline the 2026 Super Bowl 60 halftime show, with odds around 62%, after a high\u2011profile podcast appearance that sparked fan speculation. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league would love to have her perform but could not confirm details, citing the show\u2019s production by Roc Nation. Fans have linked Swift\u2019s sourdough references and the 60th edition of the game to her potential appearance, while sportsbooks and media outlets highlight her growing odds ahead of the event at Levi\u2019s Stadium. The speculation remains unconfirmed, but the narrative has gained traction across sports and entertainment coverage.",
