  "description": "PayPal accounts are now at risk \u2014 what to know.",
  "content": "A cybercriminal is now selling millions of PayPal usernames and passwords on an online forum, data PayPal told me comes from a 2022 breach. Unsurprisingly, this has triggered headline warnings (1,2) that will alarm millions of users.\n\nThe dataset being sold is not as large or as new as advertised \u2014 there are not 16 million passwords and it\u2019s not a \u201cmassive 2025 PayPal breach.\u201d But it does expose the extent of passwords that are weak and those that are reused across multiple platforms.\n\nYou can\u2019t check whether your password is listed in this sale without buying the data for $750, and you certainly don\u2019t want to do that. But if you haven\u2019t changed yours in a while, it\u2019s safest to assume it is and change it now anyway.\n\nYou should also ensure that you have enabled 2-Step Verification on your account. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS, which is inherently weak. If your device allows it, add a passkey which links your account sign-in to your device\u2019s security.\n\nFinally, whether it\u2019s an existing or a changed password, you should check it against the list of those that are easily hacked \u2014 either because they\u2019re too weak or because they\u2019re too obvious. Even if you\u2019re not using a password manager to select strong, unique passwords, it\u2019s critical you get them right.\n\nWhen it comes to passwords that are too weak, you should check the annual list from Hive Systems. This sets out why character length and a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols is so critical. It\u2019s an easy-to-follow set of rules.\n\nThe other list is also updated annually. This one comes from NordPass and covers the \u201ctop 200 most common passwords.\u201d There\u2019s a little of everything here. Numbers, sports teams, pop groups, qwerty variants and kids names. All are to be avoided.\n\nThere\u2019s a similar list available from CyberGhost, which groups awful passwords by theme rather than popularity. Given that \u201c81% of all data security breaches are caused by weak passwords,\u201d it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time to check the lists.\n\nGiven that most users do not use two-factor-authentication or regularly update passwords, it\u2019s critical that you get this right. While the revitalized PayPal breach is in the headlines, you can start there. But do the same for all your accounts, especially banking and other finance platforms as well as email and cloud data storage.",

      "text": "A hacker going by the name Chucky_BF has allegedly stolen details for 15.8 million PayPal accounts and is selling them on an internet forum at a bargain price of just $750 USD. The treasure trove of data, which is being stored in a TXT file, is said to be 1.1 GB in size. However, the authenticity of the PayPal data has not yet been confirmed.\nYou can see a screenshot of the offer in this social media post . According to the hacker, the PayPal passwords are available in plain text and the email addresses of these PayPal accounts originate from Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, and various country-specific domains.\nHow the stolen PayPal data was acquired\nAs of this writing, the hacker hasn\u2019t said where the data came from or how much of it is still up to date.\nIn this social media post, well-known security expert Troy Hunt suspects that the hacker didn\u2019t steal the data directly from PayPal\u2019s servers since PayPal doesn\u2019t store passwords in plaintext. Most likely they were taken from users, perhaps via infostealer malware.\nAccording to security site Hackread, which checked some of the data, there are some test accounts and fake accounts interspersed among the PayPal accounts, but many are genuine.\nLooking at the PayPal Newsroom, the company has not yet issued a statement about this as of this writing.\nHere\u2019s what you should do now\nIf you have a PayPal account, you should immediately go check your transaction history and account settings for any suspicious activity. You should also change your PayPal password ASAP\u2014and if you use the same password for other accounts, you should change those account passwords as well. Consider your password compromised.\nFurther reading: Careful!

      "text": "A cybercriminal is offering to sell 16 million PayPal user names and passwords on a cybercrime forum, claiming a \u201cmassive 2025 PayPal breach.\" The company says there has been no new breach and this data comes instead from a security incident in 2022.\nChucky_BF claims the dataset exposes \u201c15.8M credential pairs in plaintext,\u201d with \u201craw email: password:url entries across global domains.\u201d But the price is just $750, which would seem to support the company\u2019s rebuttal to these new claims, and suggests a much smaller volume of actual user data is included.\nAccording to HackRead, which first reported the sale, the samples \u201cshow Gmail addresses paired with passwords and linked directly to PayPal\u2019s login pages, while another features a user account appearing in both web and mobile formats, showing that the same account details were found in different versions of PayPal\u2019s services.\u201d\nThis is likely \u201ca mix of real accounts and test or fake ones, which is often the case with stolen databases.\u201d The dataset includes plenty of reused passwords, which is a wider risk for those using the same email and passwords across multiple accounts.\nThere\u2019s now so much data out there, that separating new from rehashed takes time, as we saw with the infamous 16 billion record new data breach that never was. What is undeniable, though, is that your passwords and email addresses are guaranteed to have leaked or breached or been stolen somewhere, and they will now be for sale.\nEven though PayPal says this data breach is not new, given how rarely users change passwords and how often they reuse them across accounts, it remains a serious threat.\nWhether new or a rehashed existing data breach, the advice is always the same. You should access your PayPal account settings, go to Security, and ensure your password is strong and unique, you enable 2FA using an authenticator app, and that you add a passkey to your account. All that takes under 2 minutes.\nThat way you can read the procession of \u201cmassive\u201d data breach headlines without worrying about your devices, your money or your identity. Conversely, if you still have accounts protected by nothing but passwords and SMS codes, you need to act now.\nAs for this breach, HackRead says \u201cif the claims are accurate, this would represent one of the larger PayPal-focused leaks of recent years, with millions of users across Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, and country-specific domains implicated.\u201d\nPayPal says that\u2019s not the case."

      "text": "Microsoft has something shiny and new for Apple\u2019s iPhone users \u2014 but this free upgrade comes with a warning. As the company rushes to AI-everything on Windows PCs, it turns out that smartphones are not immune. Copilot is now taking over.\nMicrosoft confirmed to Windows Latest that the app that was once the simple Office 365 is being upgraded to Microsoft 365 Copilot. But in doing so it loses the ability to edit Word, PowerPoint or Excel files. Instead you get an AI-fueled viewer and Copilot to summarize your files and answer your questions. But not to edit your documents.\nAssuming you still want to edit files, you\u2019ll need to install the standalone Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps, there will no longer be an all-in-one option.\nIf Windows Latest is anything to go by, the there could be a user backlash coming, as one app becomes four and the easy access of the past disappears.\n\u201cIt really makes me wonder how Microsoft can consistently come up with stupid ideas. This move turns the Microsoft 365 iPhone app into a Copilot-powered viewer only. You must open Word, Excel, or PowerPoint for even small edits. It also breaks simple flows, and it\u2019s definitely going to confuse people about where to chat and where to edit.\u201d\nThere is another security and privacy issue though. iPhone users will soon find themselves with a heady mix of Siri (via Apple), ChatGPT (via Siri), Gemini (via Google). MetaAI (via WhatsApp) and Copilot (via Microsoft). All on one device. Add in a new AI browser and any other chatbot or AI assistant and we\u2019re out on thin ice.\nI suspect if you ask 100 iPhone users what the privacy and security policies are across this mixed bag of apps, you\u2019ll get 100 different answers. In reality, no one knows. And while Apple invested heavily in its Private Cloud Compute to secure its badged AI queries, none of these other platforms use the same secure enclave.\nAs new AI engines are stitched into our most-used apps, just as with Gemini upgrades to Gmail, AI becomes less of an option and more of a mandatory feature upgrade. Yes, this latest move is another free AI upgrade, but how much is too much?\nThis change starts rolling out to iPhone on September 15. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the same change also rolls out to Android in the next few weeks,\u201d Windows Latest says."

      "text": "Republished on June 23 with an update on the new \u201crecord breaking\u201d password leak, and a critical password reset warning for all Google users.\nGoogle has confirmed another atack on Gmail users this week. Yet again, its own infrastructure has been exploited to compromise user accounts. And yet again, it comes with another warning for users to upgrade their accounts \u2014 this is now a must.\nEarlier this month, I covered Google\u2019s warning that most of its users still only use basic password security and are wide open to data breaches and attacks. \u201cWe want to move beyond passwords altogether,\" Google said, pushing users to replace them.\nPasskeys, it says, \"are phishing-resistant and can log you in simply with the method you use to unlock your device (like your fingerprint or face ID) \u2014 no password required.\u201d Put simply, this links account security to hardware security, and means there are no passwords to steal or two-factor authentication (2FA) codes to bypass or intercept.\nWhile that is critical for Gmail users, it\u2019s actually much wider. Google reached out to me after that article, to emphasize that the benefits are more significant for users: Adding a passkey to a Google account protects all the services and accounts that can be accessed by that sign in. Conversely, not doing so leaves all those other accounts at risk.\nEven if most user accounts were secured by passwords and 2FA codes, there would still be a push to passkeys. And while Google, Microsoft and others make 2FA mandatory, the reality is that there\u2019s still a risk that codes can be shared even if they can\u2019t be stolen. That was the crux of the latest Gmail attack, tricking users into sharing codes.\nThe raft of headlines around a Cybernews report into a new 16 billion record data breach should focus minds, even if it\u2019s \u201cnot a new data breach,\u201d per Bleeping Computer \u201cthe websites involved were not recently compromised to steal these credentials.\u201d\nMashable agrees. \u201cSome commentators were quick to call it the largest password leak in history, and in terms of raw records exposed, that\u2019s mostly, technically true. However, these records did not come from a single breach \u2014 or even a new breach. Instead, they came from many smaller ones,\" with \u201cthe end result more a \u2018greatest hits\u2019 rather than a new, noteworthy hack.\u201d Albeit that doesn\u2019t change the fact the data is out there.\nKaspersky says \u201cthe journalists haven\u2019t provided any evidence of existence of this database. Therefore, neither Kaspersky\u2019s experts nor anyone else has managed to analyze it. Therefore, we cannot say whether yours \u2013 or anyone else\u2019s \u2013 data is in there.\u201d\nCybernews has now responded to the viral media response to its article, including the clarifications. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the hype when we were writing the article. Data breaches and even the biggest-ever data leaks, unfortunately, have become somewhat mundane, and people don\u2019t seem to care that much.\u201d\nThe team also says \u201cwe\u2019re not exaggerating this \u2014 if anything, we aren\u2019t doing enough as journalists and users to hold those companies accountable by putting them in the spotlight.\u201d And that\u2019s unarguably right. These are still leaked passwords.\n\u201cIf your passwords ever get leaked,\u201d Cybernews says in an update to its article, \u201cthe damage can go way beyond just one account. Hackers can use that info to mess with your life in all kinds of ways. In the worst cases, they can even take over your digital identity. Once someone gets into your email, for example, they can reset passwords for other accounts and gain access to pretty much everything.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why Google says its users should upgrade the security of their accounts. Protecting Gmail also protects everything your Gmail account opens up.\nBut the onus is on users to change account security. We\u2019re some way off mandatory passkeys, albeit that needs to come just as mandatory 2FA is now more common. That said, Google\u2019s latest survey paints a bleak picture. Although \u201c60% of U.S. consumers say they \u201cuse strong, unique passwords,\u201d less than 50% \u201cenable 2FA.\u201d\nThe truth is that the only form of simple 2FA is SMS codes, which are sent quickly without having to exit the app or click or tap. They even autofill and often auto-delete. But SMS is woefully insecure, it\u2019s the worst possible 2FA option. And anything else \u2014 authenticator apps, physical keys, even trusted device or app sign-ins \u2014 is more painful.\nPasskeys are the opposite. They\u2019re even easier than passwords and SMS 2FA. The code (which you never see) combines your login ID, password and 2FA into a simple sign-in process authenticated by your device security \u2014 ideally biometrics. And because there is no code you can see or copy, you can\u2019t share the passkey even if you want to. Even if any of the underlying code is stolen, it only works on your actual device.\nGoogle is right \u2014 this is about much more than Gmail, even if those email account attacks generate headline after headline. While there are some misgivings about the dominance and data overreach in big tech using its span of control to sign you into multiple services, even those they don\u2019t own or control, it is more secure.\nAs Kaspersky suggests, \u201clet\u2019s set skepticism aside. Yes, we don\u2019t reliably know what exactly this leak is, or whose data is in it. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should do nothing. The first and best recommendation is to change your passwords,\u201d which is an obvious immediate step. But it doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\u201cUse passkeys wherever possible,\u201d Kaspersky also advises. \u201cThis is the modern passwordless method of logging into accounts, which is already supported by Google, iCloud, Microsoft, Meta and others.\u201d\nGoogle tells its users that \u201cwhen you pair the ease and safety of passkeys with your Google Account, you can then use Sign in with Google to log in to your favorite websites and apps \u2014 limiting the number of accounts you have to maintain.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Google and Apple users in particular \u2014 but others as well \u2014 will need to watch for inevitable texts and emails warning that passwords have been stolen and need to be reset, citing news of this record data breach. Those messages will include links to reset passwords or numbers to call account helplines.\nAny such messages are malicious fakes and should be deleted right away. Google will never reach out to its account holders in this way, and any such outreach is an attack. The company has asked me to \u201cplease reiterate to your readers that Google will not contact you to reset your password or troubleshoot account issues.\u201d\nThe FBI warns the same: \u201cLegitimate customer, security, or tech support companies will not initiate unsolicited contact with individuals.\"\nIf you receive any form of password reset message, you must access your account in the normal way. If there\u2019s an issue you\u2019ll be directed to a password reset option. Never do this by way of a link, unless you personally requested a password reset using a normal channel and a reset link is then sent to your email or phone number.\nMeanwhile, regardless of the provenance of this latest breach news, Cybernews is right when it says \u201cthe collection of datasets shows the scale of the problem \u2014 billions and billions of passwords and trillions of records, including very private medical, location, and financial data, spill online every day.\u201d"

      "text": "16 million PayPal accounts exposed on the dark web \u2014 emails, passwords and more for sale\nThe hacker has claimed they have PayPal emails, plaintext passwords and more for sale on the dark web\nEditor's Note: PayPal has reached out to Tom's Guide about this stolen data, confirming there wasn't a breach and that the exposed information is related to a security incident from back in 2022. Original story follows below:\nA post on a well-known hacking forum has claimed to have a dataset of millions of PayPal account credentials including login emails and plaintext passwords. As reported by Cybernews, the author of the post claims the stolen data was taken from May 2025 and includes 15.8 million login emails, passwords, associated URLs and variants from accounts worldwide.\nHaving emails and passwords available online for anyone to access puts PayPal users at an obvious risk \u2013 even though many users already have multi-factor authentication enabled. The exposure of associated URLs means that attackers can also be pointed at other services that are linked to the information that has been leaked. Likewise, the leak has been set up in such a way as to allow them to easily leverage the exposed data for other malicious behavior, like automated credential stuffing attacks.\nThere are few additional details about the leak at this time. The hackers responsible say that the leak includes thousands of strong and unique password strings but many may be reused which would make the amount of useful data smaller. In fact, the amount that this stolen data is being sold for to other hackers on the dark web would indicate that this is the case. Additionally, researchers have pointed out that if the stolen data was quite recent, much of it would have already been exploited by now.\nPayPal has not yet made a public comment about the forum post claims as of yet, and no one has been able to verify the post\u2019s claims either given the small size of the data sample provided. The hackers may have obtained this data through info-stealing malware, given the way that the stolen data has been structured (URL, login, password).\nInfostealers are often installed after users click on a malicious link or attachment that has malware embedded in it, then it works quietly in the background to funnel stolen information back to the attackers. Some infostealers can hide themselves or delete themselves after they\u2019ve taken passwords, browser data or payment information and they\u2019re available to buy or rent on the dark web for any platform. This is reason enough to have the best antivirus software installed on your devices and kept up to date. It\u2019s also important to follow good security practices, have browser features enabled to protect you online and make full use of the extra included in many antivirus suites like a VPN or firewall.\nHow to stay safe\nPayPal users who are concerned that their data may have been exposed should start by changing their password \u2013 and if you made the mistake of using that password anywhere else, change it there too. If you're not already using one of the best password managers to protect your passwords online, start now.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nIf you suspect your personal information may have been exposed online you should be using of the best identity theft protection services.

      "text": "Top 200\nMost Common Passwords\nIt\u2019s our sixth year\u2014this time, in collaboration with NordStellar\u2014analyzing people\u2019s password habits, and guess what? They're still really bad.\nAnd we're not just talking about personal passwords here. This time, we also put together a list of the most common corporate passwords to see how they compare to those used in everyday life.\nSo, check out all the dishonorable winners on both lists and learn what the latest trends are.\nResearch breakdown\nMethodology\nTogether with NordStellar, we reviewed and analyzed a 2.5TB database extracted from various publicly available sources, including those on the dark web. No personal data was acquired or purchased to conduct this study.\n44 countries\nWe organized the data into different categories to help us analyze it by country of origin. That said, we focused only on the statistical information, so no personal data from internet users was included in this research.\nPersonal and corporate\nWe analyzed passwords stolen by malware or exposed in data leaks. In most cases, they were leaked with email addresses, allowing us to distinguish between corporate and personal credentials by domain name.\nFindings\nMake your passwords tough to break\nDiscover how NordPass can help you create strong passwords on the spot to prevent unauthorized access.\nMost popular corporate passwords\nTake a quick look below and you\u2019ll see that the most common passwords people use at work aren\u2019t all that different from the ones they use in their personal lives. It just goes to show that, at the end of the day, people are people \u2013 no matter where they are or what they\u2019re up to, they share the same poor password habits.\nFindings\nInteresting findings\nIs it time to say goodbye to passwords?\nPasskeys are the answer\nBacked by the FIDO Alliance, passkeys are the modern solution to the password problem. At NordPass, we're one of the early adopters of passkey technology, allowing our users to enjoy a secure and smooth passwordless online experience.\nFundamentals of password safety\nCreate strong passwords\nYour password should be at least 20 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. Steer clear of easily guessable information like birthdays, names, or common words.\nReview your passwords\nMake sure to regularly check the health of your passwords. Identify any weak, old, or reused ones, and upgrade them to new, complex passwords for a safer online experience.\nNever reuse passwords\nYou should not use the same password for multiple sites or services. If one account is compromised, other accounts could be at risk.\nUse a password manager\nGenerate, store, and manage all your passwords with NordPass to ensure they\u2019re well protected, difficult to crack, and easily available when you need them.\nGet in touch\nIf you\u2019d like more information about the most common password lists or want to set up an interview, contact us at [email protected] and we will get back to you shortly."

      "text": "The internet is not a safe space and it\u2019s about to get worse. A new \u201cattack surface is far wider than anything we\u2019ve faced before,\u201d with \u201chidden risks\u201d that \u201ccompromise millions of users simultaneously.\u201d And Google\u2019s defenses are \u201cunfortunately insufficient.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the warning from Guardio, which has set out to understand just how exposed we are by new AI browsing tools and the extent to which they put us all at risk. The results are alarming. It is \u201ca perfect trust chain gone rogue,\u201d the team says, and you need to shore up your personal defenses before it\u2019s too late.\nWhile \u201cAI Browsers promise a future where Agentic AI works for you, fully automating online tasks from shopping to handling emails.\u201d this convenience \"comes with a cost.\" The team set up three tests: instructing AI to find and buy a product online, allowing AI to open a banking sign-in page, and a new spin on the viral ClickFix attack.\nIn each case, the AI agent put its human at risk \u2014 and these attacks are not sophisticated. Almost all humans would have detected these threats. And that\u2019s the key message here \u2014 AI is too easily fooled, and this attack surface is so new, that more sophisticated adversaries are only just getting started.\n\u201cAI Browsers are no longer a concept,\" Guardio says. \"Microsoft has Copilot built into Edge. OpenAI is experimenting with a sandboxed browser in \u2018agent mode\u2019. And Perplexity\u2019s Comet fully embraces the idea of a browser that browses for you. Searching, reading, shopping, clicking. It\u2019s not just assisting us, but increasingly replacing us.\"\nIn the first test, a fake Walmart online store was spun up. \u201cThe site had everything: a clean design, realistic product listings, and a checkout flow good enough to pass a casual glance.\u201d Within the AI browser \u201cthe page loads without issue and isn\u2019t blocked by Google Safe Browsing, even though GSB is active in this Chromium-based browser.\u201d\nThe AI agent was told to buy an Apple Watch and it did exactly that. \u201cIt found the Apple Watch, added it to the cart, and, without asking for confirmation, autofilled our saved address and credit card details.\u201d Seconds later \u201cthe purchase was complete.\" There is no watch, of course, just opportunistic scammers \u201calready spending their money.\u201d\nThe test didn\u2019t always succeed, sometimes the AI was not fooled \u2014 but it was fooled plenty of times. \u201cAnd when security depends on chance, it\u2019s not security.\u201d\nIn the second test, the AI browser was directed by a phishing email to a fake Wells Fargo sign-in page. \u201cThere was no URL check, no pre-navigation warning, just a direct pass to the attacker\u2019s page. Once the fake Wells Fargo login loaded, the browser treated it as legitimate. It prompted the user to enter credentials, even helping fill in the form.\u201d\nThe third test expanded on the new prompt injection threat, with these hidden behind a typical ClickFix popup, in this case a Captcha, but one with hidden instructions for the AI agent to ignore what was visible to the human and run a different script instead.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t try to glitch the model into obedience,\u201d Guardio says. \u201cInstead, we mislead it using techniques borrowed from the human social engineering playbook \u2014 appealing directly to its core design goal: to help its human quickly, completely, and without hesitation. We just provide it with the best (manipulating) methods to do so.\u201d\nGuardio warns that \u201cin the AI-vs-AI era, scammers don\u2019t need to trick millions of different people; they only need to break one AI model. Once they succeed, the same exploit can be scaled endlessly. And because they have access to the same models, they can \u201ctrain\u201d their malicious AI against the victim\u2019s AI until the scam works flawlessly.\u201d\nThis works because \u201csecurity is often an afterthought or delegated entirely to existing tools like Google Safe Browsing, which is, unfortunately, insufficient.\u201d Even the fake Wells Fargo sign-in page, which was \u201cactive in the wild for several days,\u201d was \u201cstill unflagged by Google Safe Browsing.\u201d\nThe advice is simple. If you use an AI agent and give it free rein, then change your browser settings to apply Enhanced Protection. If this isn\u2019t available, change your browser. You also need to be careful with browser-based password managers, saved credit card details and autofill. If you allow your AI agent to tap into your security credentials and your financial information, then you\u2019re out on thin ice.\nIn a world where Google controls the internet, directing us and our AI agents to the websites we visit, then Google\u2019s defenses protect the internet. If they don\u2019t work, then the internet doesn\u2019t work. A rethink is required before it\u2019s too late.\nI have reached out to Google for any comments on this new report."

The dataset, which includes 15.8 million credentials, is being sold for $750 and may contain many reused passwords, posing a significant risk to users. Security experts recommend that PayPal users change their passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid using weak or common passwords to protect their accounts.",
