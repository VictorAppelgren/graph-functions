      "feedback": "The draft is largely on‑track but suffers from a few drifted or under‑quantified statements and redundant phrasing that dilute the house view. Tighten the opening to a single, explicit base‑case range (e.g., “S&P 500 will decline 5–10 % over 3–6 months if the Fed keeps rates high and payrolls slow, or rise 3–5 % if a 25‑bp cut is priced in”) and attach the range to the canonical handle **spx** with a clear causal chain (fed_policy → ust10y → spx). Remove the generic “sticky inflation” sentence and replace it with the concrete July CPI/PCE releases (97MD1FHW8) and their dates (Oct 2025, Jan 2026) as catalysts. Consolidate the mortgage‑rate discussion into one sentence that links the 6.55 % level (LF0UUL917) to the cost‑of‑capital effect on tech valuations, citing **ust10y** and **dxy**. Replace the long paragraph on the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread with a concise bullet‑style note: “2‑yr/10‑yr spread expected to steepen 57 bp by mid‑Sept (7XH2DKEKV), raising cut probability; a flattening <30 bp would reverse this.” Ensure every claim has an inline citation and a handle mapping; e.g., “Fed’s September meeting (16‑17 Sept 2025) is the key catalyst (XTQIQRP5K).” Finally, trim the last paragraph to a single watch‑list sentence: “Watch Fed minutes, July CPI/PCE, September payrolls, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, and Q3 earnings of the top‑ten spx names; any upside surprise invalidates the pullback thesis.” This will produce a concise, evidence‑driven brief that meets the 4–6 sentence limit and adheres to the canonical mapping and catalyst requirements.",
