  "description": "How rare earth elements improve functionality and performance across a range of high-tech devices such as consumer electronics and medical equipment",
  "content": "Many essential devices rely on various rare earth element (REE) components to deliver high-performance functionality, including hybrid vehicles, televisions, and even MRI imaging tools. And that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wide range of products using rare earth technology.\n\n\n\nSo, what exactly are rare earth elements? REEs are a group of 17 elements in the periodic table, including scandium, yttrium, and 15 lanthanides. Their magnetic, phosphorescent, and catalytic properties are used to enhance magnetic strength, which ultimately improves device performance.\n\nThere's a reason why you can enjoy high-quality audio on your phone and high-definition colors on your big-screen TV. Everyday consumer electronics use one or more rare earth elements for better functionality.\n\u2022 Smartphones: REEs are used in speakers and microphones to enhance audio performance. Neodymium and praseodymium help create compact, high-performance magnets that are essential for powerful sounds.\n\u2022 Laptops and tablets: Both devices rely on long battery life and a high-definition display, which is produced by a combination of lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium.\n\u2022 LED TVs and monitors: Neodymium, europium, terbium, and yttrium improve the color accuracy of displays, brightness, and energy efficiency.\n\u2022 Headphones and gaming consoles: These systems use tiny magnets containing neodymium to generate high-fidelity sound. Rare earth elements play a key role in improving the efficiency and durability of components used in electric vehicles and renewable-energy systems.\n\u2022 Electric vehicles: EVs use motors with magnets made from neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium. The magnets convert electrical energy into mechanical power.\n\u2022 Wind turbines: Rare earth metals create high-performance permanent magnets used by wind turbines to create low-maintenance and efficient energy generation.\n\u2022 Rechargeable batteries: These often use lanthanum and cerium to enhance energy storage and reliability.\n\u2022 Solar technology: Elements such as phosphors are often used in solar technology to convert ultraviolet light into visible wavelengths for better solar panel efficiency. Military and defense operations depend on high-tech equipment that offers precision, enhanced imaging, infrared capabilities, and a compact design.\n\u2022 Jet engines and missile guidance: Neodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are some of the rare earth elements in key components of jet engines and missile systems, such as magnets and actuators, as well as in alloys that need to withstand high temperatures.\n\u2022 Radar and sonar: Radar and sonar rely on high-performance electronic systems such as signal processors, rotating antennas, and motors to deliver signals in difficult conditions. Neodymium or samarium-cobalt magnets are used in these systems to enhance performance.\n\u2022 Satellite communications: Satellites use erbium, ytterbium, and neodymium elements in laser crystals and fiber optics to send and receive GPS and broadcast data over long distances. Accurate diagnoses and effective surgical procedures rely on medical equipment and imaging tools that deliver exact and detailed information.\n\u2022 MRI machines: These require gadolinium (a contrast agent) to create strong magnetic fields to assist with detailed imaging of the body. Gadolinium improves the clarity of bone structures while highlighting soft tissue areas.\n\u2022 X-ray and imaging devices: Gadolinium, terbium, and europium are used in X-ray and imaging devices to produce sharper images.\n\u2022 Laser surgery tools: Laser surgical devices use rare earth elements like neodymium for precision cutting and cauterizing, while erbium is commonly used in skin resurfacing treatments. Rare earth elements aren't limited to high-tech tools and specialized industries; they're also used in many everyday household products and industrial applications.\n\u2022 Power tools: Advanced power tools use long-lasting rechargeable batteries made from lanthanum, an element that enables batteries to hold more charge and withstand harsh conditions.\n\u2022 Automotive emissions: Harmful emissions, such as carbon monoxide in automotive systems, can be reduced with the right combination of rare earth catalysts for cleaner air.\n\u2022 Fluorescent lighting: Phosphor coatings containing rare earth elements enable fluorescent lights to convert ultraviolet light into visible wavelengths, producing brighter, more vivid colors. Rare earth elements play a key role in improving the efficiency of renewable energy technologies, making them essential to the future of sustainable energy production.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",

      "text": "Rare Earths Statistics and Information\nStatistics and information on the worldwide supply of, demand for, and flow of the mineral commodity group rare earths - scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides\nThe principal economic sources of rare earths are the minerals bastnasite, monazite, and loparite and the lateritic ion-adsorption clays. The rare earths are a relatively abundant group of 17 elements composed of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. The elements range in crustal abundance from cerium, the 25th most abundant element of the 78 common elements in the Earth's crust at 60 parts per million, to thulium and lutetium, the least abundant rare-earth elements at about 0.5 part per million. The elemental forms of rare earths are iron gray to silvery lustrous metals that are typically soft, malleable, and ductile and usually reactive, especially at elevated temperatures or when finely divided. The rare earths' unique properties are used in a wide variety of applications.\nSubscribe to receive an email notification when a new publication is added to this page.
