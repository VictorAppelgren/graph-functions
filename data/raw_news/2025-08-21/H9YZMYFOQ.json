  "title": "I got most of a space station killed in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn",
  "description": "My biggest question after watching a demo at Gamescom is if I have agreed to smuggle a cat",
  "content": "The Expanse novels by James S. A. Corey are set in a near future world where the decisions of politicians, corporations, detectives, and soldiers have big consequences for the fate of the Solar System. Likewise, your decisions in Owlcat Games\u2019 The Expanse: Osiris Reborn can prove just as momentous. Case in point, you\u2019re not going to get a warning before making a call that gets most of a space station killed. That's what I learned during an hour-long closed-door preview of the game at Gamescom, which was hands-off but did allow me to dictate certain choices.\n\nOsiris Reborn takes place amidst the first two books in The Expanse series or the first two and a half seasons of the excellent Syfy/Prime Video TV series. You control a pair of identical twin mercenaries working for Pinkwater Security, who made the very unfortunate decision to visit the asteroid Eros when the corporation Protogen was conducting an experiment there involving an extraterrestrial material. The siblings escape by stealing a Protogen shuttle, bringing trouble back to the Pinkwater space station.\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of The Expanse, but you don\u2019t really need to know all the backstory of the conflict between Earth, Mars, and the Belters to get into this game. You certainly don\u2019t need to know anything about the alien Protomolecule since the characters will be learning its secrets as you go. When you arrive at Pinkwater Station, you can watch the momentous broadcast from The Expanse protagonist James Holden explaining the nature of the bioattack on Eros. Owlcat looked to the series for the visuals of key characters and the world, and has promised some of the actors will make appearances in the game.\n\nYou can choose the gender of your starting character as well as a preset build, like marksman (a sniper) or officer, which mostly relies on assault rifles. This isn\u2019t a class, just a choice of starting equipment and abilities. You also choose where your character is from, which impacts their appearance and story.\n\nThe space station is very lively and detailed, down to menus showing what they eat \u2014 algae apparently \u2014 with NPCs gossiping about the news. We chat with Luciana, who has fresh supplies from Europa we can buy and seems to want to tell us what everyone else on the station is looking for.\n\nLarry, an exhausted station worker, punctuates his dialogue with Belter sign language and asks us to do him a favor by bringing a birthday present to his mom so he doesn\u2019t have to pay for shipping. He says it\u2019s a painting but is adamant that we don\u2019t open it. The quest is called \u201cA Purrfect Gift.\u201d Is it a picture of a cat? Is it a cat? Am I a cat smuggler? The developers leading my demo won\u2019t answer these pressing questions.\n\nBut that mystery will have to wait as a Protogen ship approaches the station, demanding their stolen spacecraft back. You can tell the station commander you\u2019ll find a way to escape or, if you have a high enough persuasion score, you can convince him to take up arms against the corporate security. We tried this and it was not a good idea.\n\nThe twins sneak out through the vents, but are quickly spotted and shot at by Protogen security, the color switching to grayscale to indicate our low health. This is a particularly tricky portion of the game as it\u2019s just you and your sibling \u2014 usually you\u2019ll have two companions \u2014 so it requires making good use of cover and the environment. Luckily, your friend Zahar, one of the first companions you get, is guiding you remotely from your stolen ship.\n\nYour sibling, J, has the ability to take advantage of structural weaknesses. A well-placed shot can cause the ceiling to collapse or blow up parts of the environment to catch enemies on fire. Companions all have their own specialist ability, so a hacker might be able to use a terminal to hit people nearby with an EMP blast while a sniper can provide supporting fire. The impact the fighting is having on the environment is impressively detailed, with the walls quickly becoming pockmarked by bullets.\n\nThe station is so swarmed by Protogen agents that Zafar encourages you to go outside to sneak around. The view from outer space is gorgeous, with Jupiter looming large against the starscape and the station\u2019s spinning ring. You can walk on any surface using your magboots and the camera adjusts based on where you\u2019re standing. Sound is toned down: no one can hear you scream in space, but you can still sense movement in the vibrations beneath your boots.\n\nExploring thoroughly rewards you with crafting materials, money, and equipment, with some paths locked behind skills you or your companions have. Protogen has figured out your ploy, and engages you on the station exterior, where the debris they create by shooting up the environment floats around in space along with the bodies and globs of blood. We spot a sniper using a scanner ability and break through his cover using an armor-piercing weapon through his cover.\n\nAfter the heated battle there\u2019s an impressive cutscene where the brothers use thrusters on their backpack to float up, compensating for the station\u2019s drift while dodging debris and barely making it to the ring where their ship is. They can choose their method of approach based on advice from your companion, which will both impact what you encounter and your companion\u2019s reaction.\n\nGoing back into the station, we see the results of the choice. The place is littered with bodies and we even see a Protogen agent executing a captive. The station arsenal has been mostly depleted by the people who fought back, but there\u2019s still a few items to grab. As a particularly imposing Protogen soldier in power armor comes at you, Larry bails you out and sends you on your way with a reminder of that package. I really hope it\u2019s a cat.\n\nThe fighting takes us back to the place where we started the demo and onto our ship, where we meet up with Zahar. After that, we\u2019ll have the freedom to explore Ceres, Mars, and Luna with a branching story that should take 20 to 30 hours, running parallel to Holden\u2019s story. The decision made on the station proved to be disastrous for the people there, but the race to safety was exciting, filled with a mix of complex fights and dramatic cutscenes. I\u2019m very much looking forward to seeing how my choices impact the rest of the game.",

      "text": "On Feb. 6 at 4 p.m. PST, The Expanse is reportedly scheduled to leave Prime Video \u2014 not all of it, mind you. Just the first three seasons; those are the ones that aired on Syfy, before the show was rescued from cancellation by Prime. So while seasons 4-6 will stay on Prime Video, the beginning of the show will be gone.\nThis isn\u2019t a sure thing. (Polygon has reached out to Amazon for comment, and will update this when we hear back.) And there have been times in the past where streaming channels have totally reversed a show\u2019s removal even when it seemed set in stone. The world of streaming library rights is bizarre and byzantine, and it\u2019s a strange and confusing place to be in with a beloved show like The Expanse, particularly when it leaves half a show in its wake. It wouldn\u2019t be alone, but that doesn\u2019t make it easier to take. It\u2019s just another reminder how helpless it can feel amid the carousel of content.\nThe truth is, for as much as they can feel interchangeable with archives, streaming libraries aren\u2019t anything like that. It makes sense when shows that get rebooted or rescued by streamers go to live there forever (or the streaming timeline equivalent of it) \u2014 Gilmore Girls is still fully on Netflix after its revival, and Leverage is on Prime Video with ads after Redemption started up a few years ago. But even when it feels like the rights line up just as you\u2019d expect, the capitalism of it all makes it slippery. Just like the old Hollywood practices they stem from, these shows are part of a business, an intersection of culture and commerce that pulls back the constant tension between those two sides. And at the end of the day, streaming services don\u2019t owe us access, even when they\u2019re the \u201chome\u201d of those shows.\nSo much of modern life is about chasing preservation in some way \u2014 what does or doesn\u2019t get saved by the apps we use; what moments we can remember forever; what favorites we can maintain, for whenever the mood strikes. It\u2019s no surprise there\u2019s a similar sentiment among media: For every silent classic or TV icon saved from being forgotten, there\u2019s a million more whose film was corrupted, or whose records got taped over, or that just never made it to DVD. There was a time when The Expanse was a darling saved by the goodwill of Jeff Bezos himself. Now it\u2019s just another show that might hop between sites as rights agreements lapse and renew.\nAll we\u2019re really left with is accepting that in and of itself can be a beautiful thing \u2014 not the part where it\u2019s bandied about and you never know if someday will be the day you click over and it\u2019s gone, but the fact that it existed at all. The Expanse is a delightful sci-fi epic, marrying intergalactic political intrigue with grounded characters stepping up in the void of the cosmos. As it goes on it keeps layering in more world, and more complication. You might think Jared Harris\u2019 accent is weird and off-kilter \u2014 it is! Just in a very specific \u201cthe Belter creole developed from very specific Earth dialects\u201d kind of way. The cast is great, tackling physical and verbal power struggles with equal aplomb. And for my money, Wes Chatham\u2019s Amos is an all-timer muscle character.\nThere\u2019s no wrong time to watch The Expanse, a show that rather elegantly metes out complicated book lore (and drastically improves its source material\u2019s start by both immediately introducing more conflict among the Rocinante crew and giving us Shohreh Aghdashloo\u2019s spectacular Avasarala right away). Whether it\u2019s leaving next month, next year, or next century, there\u2019s no time like the present to wade into the thoughtful science fiction of its world and ponder how we, too, can step up in the face of bureaucracy and say no to the easy answer in favor of doing the harder thing (in this case: ignoring a weird but promising alien fungus). After all, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone.\nAll six seasons of The Expanse are streaming (for now!) on Prime Video. The first three may be removed Feb. 6.\nThe Expanse: The Complete Series"

      "text": "It\u2019s been clear since James Holden first stepped foot on the Rocinante: The Expanse would make for an incredible game. While the popular sci-fi series has previously been imagined as a game (a Telltale narrative, a tabletop RPG), developer Owlcat Games\u2019 forthcoming The Expanse: Osiris Reborn seems like it\u2019ll take it to a whole new level.\nPlanned for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X sometime in the near-ish future (it's currently listed as \"coming soon\" on Steam), The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a third-person action-RPG in the vein of Mass Effect. Like Telltale's 2023 narrative-driven RPG, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, Osiris Reborn features some familiar faces from The Expanse TV show, but the two games have some major differences. Although Telltale definitely nailed the general vibe of The Expanse universe, the game\u2019s scope was limited, and like every Telltale title, its combat mainly consisted of QTEs. But unlike Telltale's take on The Expanse, Osiris Reborn will feature both tough narrative choices and legit, real-time combat \u2014 including spaceship battles, traditional gunplay, and fights in zero-g.\nIn short, this game looks like every Expanse's fan's dream.\nFor Osiris Reborn, Owlcat Games' dev team seems to have really zeroed in on the ingredients needed to tell a good Expanse story. They've embraced comparisons to Mass Effect, and they\u2019re not going easy on the franchise's frequent dips into the realm of cosmic horror, either. In fact, Owlcat Games creative director Alexander Mishulin told Polygon that on at least one occasion, players will come face-to-face with what is arguably the creepiest entity in the Expanse universe: the Hybrid.\nIn The Expanse TV show, the Hybrid is a horrifying creature that terrorizes Martian marine Bobby Draper (Frankie Adams), killing her entire team and leaving her as the sole survivor. True Expanse lore-heads will know the Hybrid is the result of Project Caliban, an experiment run by an Earth-based company called Protogen, which specializes in private security, but also has a massive research wing. Protogen exposes its unwitting test subjects (mainly children and teens) to the protomolecule, a mysterious alien substance that seems to corrupt all that it touches. Most of Project Caliban's subjects do not survive the process. The unfortunate few who do make it become Hybrids: 50% human, 50% protomolecule, 110% terrifying.\nOnce Osiris Reborn launches, Expanse fans will get to see a Hybrid for the first time since Season 3 of the TV show aired in 2018. In fact, it sounds like players may be facing more than one of them.\n\"We can confirm that you will be facing Project Caliban, which means Hybrids,\" Mishulin told Polygon in a recent interview. \"They will be in the game. You will be facing off with them. You're starting [the game] on Eros, and that means this horrific [Project Caliban] experiment. This means being close to [the] protomolecule.\"\nThe last time Expanse fans got a look at a Hybrid, it had made its way into the cargo bay of the Rocinante, a ship that doubles as both the home and the base of operations for the show's main characters. Given the fact that Osiris Reborn takes place during the first two-and-a-half seasons of the TV show, the game's devs have made a point of ensuring that the actions of the Rocinante's crew will be directly felt by players. Some of the Roci's crew members may also be making an appearance.\n\"You will be exploring your own story, but time and again you will be meeting consequences \u2014 not only of your actions, but of [Rocinante captain James] Holden's actions as well,\" Mishulin explained. \"One of the antagonists you will be facing is Protogen, but you have a different fight, and alongside your journey, you will be meeting familiar faces.\"\nAs for which Expanse TV show characters players will encounter in Osiris Reborn? Mishulin and the rest of the dev team are keeping their lips zipped for now.\n\"We are not telling who, we are not telling how, but we can confirm that some of the actors from the series will be making [an] appearance in our game,\" Mishulin told Polygon.\nZero-g combat is another crucial aspect of adapting the Expanse into a video game. In both the books and the show, characters spend hours in low- or no-gravity environments, with some characters even having to take special drugs to withstand regular gravity since their bodies are so acclimated to a lack of it. Obviously, leaving out zero-g combat wasn't an option. But implementing it hasn\u2019t exactly been a spacewalk for the developers.\n\"We are still doing it right now,\" Mishulin said of Owlcat's ongoing quest to perfect the game's zero-g experience. \"Because it's an additional layer to the combat, and we would want our players to feel \u2014 on one hand \u2014 feel the dangers of the space, and understand that space is a hostile environment. But on the other hand, we want them to feel how cool it is.\"\nMishulin said the \"rule of cool\" did occasionally win out over strict adherence to hard sci-fi. For example, in reality, you cannot hear anything in the open vacuum of space. But in Osiris Reborn, gunshots fired in space are still audible to the player, because watching people shoot at each other in dead silence isn't exactly a thrilling experience. When it comes to player perception, Mishulin told Polygon, \"We want you to have a visceral combat experience.\"\n\"We want it to be flashy,\" he said of Osiris Reborn's combat. \"So, for example, you will be hearing shots in a vacuum. Not because we don't know [that you can't hear things in space], but because we want you to experience that [flashiness].\"\nThis is great news for Expanse fans who have been craving a game set in The Expanse universe that focuses heavily on both combat mechanics (including ship combat and zero-g combat) and a compelling narrative in which player choices matter and the surrounding universe feels believably embroiled in its own political and humanitarian conflicts.\nDespite its futuristic tech and far-flung setting, The Expanse is ultimately about telling very human stories, especially stories that revolve around the often-difficult choices its characters are forced to make (sometimes in the heat of battle).\nAlthough Polygon hasn't yet had a chance to try out the game, it's clear that Osiris Reborn's developers are aiming to please The Expanse's massive community of fans, who are aching to explore a universe of heart-pounding combat, interstellar romance, tough decision-making, Machievellian political intrigue \u2014 and, of course, creepy protomolecule monsters."
