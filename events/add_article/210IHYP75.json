      "summary": "Amex Exploration’s updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Perron gold project in Quebec shows highly attractive economics, with a 17.5‑year life‑of‑mine producing 1.66 million ounces at an average grade of 5.07 g/t and an all‑in sustaining cost of US$1,061/oz. The project’s net initial CAPEX is $77.5 million, and the PEA projects a post‑tax NPV of $1.085 billion and an IRR of 70% at a gold price of US$2,500/oz, with a 1.4‑year payback. Production will begin with a 4‑year toll‑milling phase followed by a 2,000 t/d on‑site processing plant, delivering 95% recovery and low operating costs. The updated MRE released May 21 2025 underpins the economics, and the project is slated to start commercial production in 2028, providing a catalyst for gold investors and miners seeking high‑grade, low‑cost operations.",
