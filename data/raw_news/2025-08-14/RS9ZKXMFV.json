  "title": "\u2018Devil\u2019s in Details\u2019 With Trump Intel Stake: PIMCO's Cantrill",
  "description": "Libby Cantrill, PIMCO\u2019s Managing Director and Head of Public Policy, says the president may not be able to take a stake in Intel unilaterally, since Congress retains that power under the Constitution. She tells Katie Greifeld and Matt Miller on \u201cThe Close\u201d that this signals the president\u2019s willingness to transact and sends a clear message to American companies that engagement with the White House will be important. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "We're still trying to wrap our minds around this breaking news from Bloomberg News that the Trump administration is set to discuss taking a stake in Intel. You marry that together with the news that we got at the beginning of this week, that the government is set to receive a 15% slice of revenues from Chinese chip sales made by in video and AMD. I wonder how you're thinking about those two items and what could be coming. How does that change your understanding about how the U.S. government, specifically the presidential administration, is going to interact with American companies? Yeah, well, nice to be with you. I think like everything, the devil will be in the details. I think it's really important, though, to point out, particularly as it relates to the intel news, that the president the president may not be able to do this unilaterally. Just keep in mind that Congress still has the power of the purse enshrined by the Constitution and then codified by various different statutes along along the way. And so the president may be interested in taking a share of of intel, but as it relates to a direct investment that would most likely require Congress. So I think just from a preliminary basis, we we should maybe reserve judgment, just given that those details would need to be outlined and finalized. I think that as it relates to the Nvidia deal, again, that also might be in violation of the experts clause of the Constitution, but that might be there might be some fungibility there, I think, and does look like the Supreme Court is is apt to side with President Trump regardless of what the Constitution says. I wonder if you can imagine an export tax for many other big businesses. Will this become the norm if the president gets his way? Yeah, I mean, I might I might push back on that assertion. You know, we've certainly seen the Supreme Court side with the president, but also not. So I don't think this is necessarily sort of open and shut from from that perspective. But it's obviously does just broadly indicate a president who is willing to transact. You know, this is sort of the transaction man in, you know, in play. And as a result, as a result, it is a clear signal to American companies that having engagement with this White House is going to be important. But again, I think that we should reserve judgment until we do see those the kind of the finer print, because I think there are a lot of a lot of details that do need to be filled out really before we can sort of assess the viability of this and the likelihood of it. Well, speaking of transactions, one of the other big news items out there is that apparently the government plans to IPO, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This has been anticipated, speculated about for some time. You just have to look at the share chart to see that speculation. But lately, when it comes to, you know, really paying attention to the details, too, this is not a sort of open and closed process. There's a lot of hurdles to jump through here as well. You know, there there are. And I think just, you know, zooming out, I mean, the US mortgage market is in many ways the envy of the world. And Fannie and Freddie have a lot to do with that. They are incredibly effective at ensuring liquidity and the secondary mortgage market. So I think we as agency investors really take the approach of doing no harm. Whomever controls Fannie and Freddie, we want to ensure that there is no disruption to the mortgage market. That was echoed by Secretary Bessant over the last 24 hours as well. So we very much share that, that view. I do think, again, you know, not to be the negative, Nancy, here, but when you actually look at the details and the complexity of Fannie and Freddie and again, the public good that they serve to the the the the broader home market and housing market, you know, I think that there will likely be probably more questions than answers here. And I think broadly speaking, you know, our view is that while an IPO is certainly possible, a fall timeframe seems really aggressive in terms of regulatory capital, in terms of some of rule makings that we think would need to be in the works. So I think bottom line here is, again, while these make great headlines and certainly help with the, you know, the share prices of the common and preferred, you know, again, over over use of the statement. But the really the devil will be in the details and we think on this front probably a lot more to do than maybe the market expects at this point. Libya, you're so focused on policy, obviously for PIMCO but decisions about. The Fed. Well, the replacement for Adriana Kugler seat as well as who will be the Fed chair, they could be one and the same. They could be different people. Since we know Steven, Myron is only temporary. How do you think that affects the FOMC? Because the administration is calling for and the market is priced in rate cuts to the point that would bring the terminal rate below the current level of core CPI. Yes. I mean, I think a couple of things. One is that you just don't don't forget that there is this advice and consent role of the US Senate. So whomever is nominated by the president will also have to get confirmed not only by the broader Senate, which would require 50 votes, but also they'd have to get through the Senate Banking Committee. And because of that very narrow split. Whomever is nominated, Stephen, Myron, for instance, cannot lose even one Republican vote, assuming no Democrats vote for him. So there is still a long way from here to there, if you if you will. And we don't think that regardless, should he get confirmed, we don't think that's he probably will be on the Fed by September. So that puts him on the FOMC, a voting member of the FOMC, probably by the end of October. But I think the broader point here and something that we are very much in for of reinforcing to our clients is that while, you know, a Fed official, Fed governor is, of course, an important voice, they are just one voice and there are 12 voting members of the FOMC. The chair obviously has sort of a disproportionate impact, but still is only one person. So I think that while there have been concerns about, you know, the personnel being kind of the policy, it's just important to zoom out and remember that, again, there are only one or two voices on a Fed and there needs to be a majority vote, of course, to to change monetary policy.",
