  "title": "PSG Partners With Rematch To Drive Unique User-Generated U.S. Content",
  "description": "Rematch's new AI-rewind technology allows fans to generate their own content at youth sports games. The company just signed a deal with PSG's U.S. academies.",
  "content": "Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s (PSG) U.S. academies are partnering with community-driven sports highlight platform Rematch to allow their communities to capture and share unique content from games across the country.\n\nThe partnership will integrate into the PSG Academy ecosystem and allow for social media collaborations. As part of the agreement, \u201cRematch will organize and share the best highlights from across the [PSG] academies for each individual use on a weekly basis. In turn, the PSG Academy brand will be embedded on all captured and shared content from academy competitions and training.\u201d\n\nThe agreement begins this fall and will include six of PSG academies: Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, and Phoenix. There was even strong interest from PSG\u2019s academy in British Columbia, but the Rematch app is not yet operational in Canada, so that agreement will not be finalized until 2026.\n\nRematch U.S. CEO Hanna Howard says this partnership will \u201cunlock access to content that most academies and clubs don\u2019t have.\u201d The highlights will be user-generated, from the sidelines, without the need for a videographer.\n\nRematch is a French company founded in 2019. It allows sports fans to effortlessly capture highlights and provides \u201ca dedicated social platform where highlights can be viewed and shared-so every player, every game, every highlight can be seen and celebrated.\u201d\n\nUnlike traditional videography, which requires a camera, a full match recording, and then hours of video editing to deliver a highlights package, Rematch\u2019s software allows fans to live the memorable moment in real-time and then go back and capture it on camera. Using a specialized AI-powered rewind software, fans using the Rematch app just need to hit record after the goal, basket, or try is scored, and the app will automatically capture the preceding fifteen to twenty seconds of action, giving the user a high-quality, ready-made highlight clip.\n\nThe app was popularized in the French grassroots sports market before launching in the U.S. Since 2019, Rematch has partnered with the French Federations for basketball, soccer, handball, rugby, and others, and has had over 700 million highlights views.\n\nRematch launched in January 2025 in the U.S. In its first six months, Rematch videos have had roughly 10.5 million views across social media platforms, and the app is expected to eclipse more than 10,000 users by the end of August.\n\nWith more than 2,000 total games filmed and 22,000 highlights captured, the app is democratizing sports visibility, allowing the best moments across all youth sports to be watched.\n\nIn the company\u2019s own words, \u201cRematch is a movement to celebrate participation, connect communities, and open new opportunities for sponsors and organizations to engage a passionate sports audience.\u201d\n\nPSG Partnership and the Future of Rematch\n\nRematch launched in the U.S. with a focus on youth soccer before successfully expanding into basketball. The app is looking to add more sports, notably volleyball and American football, and even had a brief beta trial with .\n\nThe partnership with PSG\u2019s U.S. academies was the product of mutual connections. Rematch pitched its offering to the Parisian powerhouse back in April. As Howard recalls, \u201cthey really took a liking to it.\u201d It helped that there was also a French connection.\n\nFor what Howard describes as \u201ca significant discount,\u201d the six PSG academies will receive access to user-generated content that can enhance the club\u2019s brand visibility in the U.S. The app has no cost, which means parents and casual fans can easily download it. Recording is so simple that any fan with a smartphone can do it. From there, Rematch will review all the captured content, tailor highlight videos, and upload them to social media with club branding.\n\nHoward also says there will be opportunities for brand collaborations. Rematch will provide the academies (and any partner entity) with performance metrics of different posts, monthly reports on involvement, and will even spotlight parents who post the most high-performing content as a way of providing inter-academy gamification.\n\nRematch remains hyper-focused on celebrating highlights regardless of sporting level or competition. The company is developing a premium version of the app, which will cost users $4.99 a month and will allow fans to capture videos in 4k or 1080p and will provide filters that remove camera shake, distracting audio, and customized video length \u2014 at the moment, soccer highlights default to 15 seconds.\n\nThe low monthly fee is part of Rematch\u2019s efforts to remain appealing to the widest possible user base. As Howard says, \u201cWe are really determined to maintain accessibility for parents.\u201d The partnership with PSG is just the beginning. Rematch is open to the possibility of partnering with professional leagues and clubs, just as it did with MLR. In the age of content creation, this is a chance for all fans to actively celebrate their sports.",

      "text": "It\u2019s been a dizzying month for Major League Rugby.\nJust a month ago, the New England Free Jacks were celebrating their third-straight MLR Championship \u2014 heralding the dawn of America\u2019s first rugby dynasty. Viewing figures were up, with 258 percent year-over-year streaming viewership growth and a 135 percent year-over-year increase in total minutes streamed \u2014 largely thanks to the league\u2019s deal with ESPN. MLR even saw its first documentary, \u201cUnited States of Rugby,\u201d hit screens across the country.\nUnfortunately, the promise of MLR\u2019s eighth season has disappeared like Cheslin Kolbe in open space. It\u2019s been roughly a week since news surfaced that Major League Rugby\u2019s California clubs, San Diego Legion and RFC L.A., are merging and that NOLA Gold is stepping away from the competition in 2026. At the time, MLR CEO Nic Benson stated, \u201cWe\u2019re as bullish as we\u2019ve ever been about our potential to drive value for the sport and through the sport.\u201d\nHowever, since speaking with me, Benson has received more bad news. The Miami Sharks announced they would also be withdrawing from MLR, just two seasons after joining. As first reported in the Guardian, the Sharks asked to take one season off before returning to MLR in 2027, a request which was denied by the board.\nBoth NOLA and Miami could apply to re-join the league in 2027, but as of now, MLR will go into its ninth season with just eight teams \u2014 the lowest number since its second season.\nIt\u2019s well known in U.S. rugby circles that both the Utah Warriors and the Miami Sharks were in search of additional funding ahead of the 2026 MLR season. While there is quiet confidence that Utah will secure additional funding, Miami\u2019s ownership group has pulled the plug on their operation, not seeing the returns they were expecting.\nWith so much turmoil just a month after MLR\u2019s championship game in Rhode Island, fans must wonder what these changes mean for rugby in the U.S., especially with the Olympic sevens and two Rugby World Cups coming to the States in 2028, 2031, and 2033.\nThe California Legion Merger\nSan Diego Legion and RFC L.A. have joined forces to become the California Legion. The new entity will pool resources and be Southern California\u2019s sole professional club. Former Wallaby Adam Freier, who has been a key figure in Los Angeles rugby for the past four years, will take the reins as CEO of the California Legion. No details have been shared about whether former San Diego Legion owner Ryan Patterson or RFC L.A. owner Pete Sickle are equal partners or one is the majority owner of the new club.\nUpon the announcement of the new club, Freier said, \u201cOur vision is for every young rugby player in California to know there is a clear path to pursue their sport from youth to pro and that path begins with structure, support, and alignment at every stage across the state.\u201d\nUnderstandably, San Diego and L.A. fans will feel hard done by. After all, they are rivals in most sports, and the San Diego Legion had one of the strongest followings in the country. However, Freier is adamant that this move will help align the Southern California rugby community and pay dividends in the long term.\nThe team will not operate in a single location; instead, it will have home matches in San Diego, L.A., and Orange County. This is not a short-term vision either; the club wants to make use of its connections across Southern California to ensure everyone in the rugby community has a chance to see their team play. No statements have been issued on how season tickets will be affected by the new multi-city stadium decision.\nFreier also noted that the team will change color depending on where it is playing. \u201cAt no point will the California Legion enter their stadium in San Diego without their red armor,\u201d he told me, adding that they will play in baby blue when in L.A. Cynics will point out how difficult it will be to build a new identity and extended fanbase, chopping and changing stadiums and colors. But Freier is adamant that \u201cIt\u2019s about being brave and doing things differently.\u201d\nWith the Major League Rugby College Draft taking place at the end of August, California Legion and MLR will need to move quickly to sort out the future of the players that were once on two separate franchises.\nFreier was once the head of the Players\u2019 Association in Australian rugby. As such, he says, \u201cI understand that there would be a lot of anxiety and confusion about this from a player\u2019s point of view.\u201d But he said that the MLR will give the club some time to blend the new squad, noting that no players will be trapped in any deals, nor will established pros be forced to enter a draft and wait for another franchise to call their name.\nThe overriding feeling from fans (and likely players) regarding the new California Legion is uncertainty. At best, the club could unite Southern California\u2019s rugby communities and its sizable player pool, making the Legion into a giant capable of conquering MLR. At worst, it could be a disparate assembly of players roaming from one stadium to the next without a coherent fanbase. What is clear is that Freier and Benson are both fully backing the merger.\nAt the time of the announcement, Benson said, \u201cThis new team will build and connect rugby communities to elevate the game in Southern California,\u201d while Freier told me directly, \u201cWe want to make California one of the strongest rugby states not only in America but on the planet.\u201d Benson has also previously mentioned the league\u2019s desire to have a club in Northern California, particularly the Bay Area or Sacramento, where there are strong grassroots clubs and thriving, rugby-loving Polynesian communities.\nMiami and NOLA\u2019s Departures\nNOLA Gold announced its decision to leave Major League Rugby at the end of July, just one season after making its first playoff appearance. The club\u2019s official statement only states that it will not be participating in the 2026 season, leaving the door open for a future comeback.\nNOLA did not publicly offer a reason for its decision to leave the league, but rumors are that its leadership did not see eye to eye with MLR and the direction the league was heading. For now, the franchise\u2019s ownership group seems intent on investing in community rugby.\nIn its end-of-season message, NOLA cited a 30% increase in ticket revenue as \u201ca strong indicator of the growing support from our community.\u201d The Gold have introduced over 4,500 children to rugby and seem to be prioritizing the rugby development moving forward.\nDespite their departure from MLR, NOLA said, \u201cOur belief in rugby\u2019s long-term potential remains constant - not just on the Gulf Coast, but across the United States. We are building something meaningful here: a franchise rooted in values of commitment, respect, and resilience, and a community that embraces rugby as a force for unity and excellence.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen if this will continue to be true as the club moves forward outside of MLR.\nMiami\u2019s departure is an unforeseen blow, and the timing could not be more ironic. On Monday, MLR announced that Sharks CEO Milagros Cubelli, the sister of Argentina scrum-half Tom\u00e1s Cubelli, was voted MLR Executive of the Year by her peers.\nCubelli helped guide the Sharks to their first-ever playoff appearance, where they lost to eventual champions New England, and drove sponsorship revenue up 20% in 2025. However, improved performances on and off the field were not enough to convince owner Marcos Galperin, one of Argentina\u2019s richest men, to continue funding the MLR operation.\nThe Future of Rugby in the U.S.\nFreier and Benson were both quick to note that the contraction of MLR is not representative of a decreasing appetite for rugby in the U.S., and they\u2019re right. There are pockets of rugby enthusiasts around the country and a desire for the game to grow at the highest level.\nThe most popular rugby player on the planet, Ilona Maher, is American. USA Rugby recently fundraised over $1.8 million to bolster its product over the next three years, and World Rugby is committed to investing over $250 million in rugby in the U.S. to ensure the country can deliver two excellent World Cups and have sustained rugby growth decades into the future.\nMLR\u2019s reduction to eight clubs is evidence that the league continues to search for ways to lower operational expenses while substantially increasing revenues. It can be seen as a natural contraction, similar to that of MLS, before it launches into MLR 2.0 and clubs pop up in new cities across the country. That is the hope, at least.\nSpeaking to me after the California Legion announcement, Freier said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should be looking at these teams stepping back as representative of a lack of rugby growth in this country, it\u2019s not.\u201d The former Wallaby also praised the MLR\u2019s owners, saying, \u201cThese owners are incredible. It\u2019s expensive to be an owner, and they are passionate rugby people. They love the game.\u201d\nBenson, meanwhile, said, \u201cTurmoil and reinvention in a young league are not uncommon; the test will be how we navigate it.\u201d The league\u2019s CEO added, \u201cWe have a core group of committed owners, that hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019m confident in the ability of our team and the group of owners to navigate it well.\u201d\nWhether the ownership groups are as incredible as Freier says or not, what continues to hamper rugby is the game\u2019s disparate nature in the U.S. and abroad. World Rugby CEO Alan Gilpin has gone on record stating that the U.S. needs strong domestic men\u2019s and women\u2019s leagues in place ahead of the World Cups in 2031 and 2033. MLR and Women\u2019s Elite Rugby (WER) were expected to be those leagues, but as cracks surface, the rugby vultures are circling.\nRumors about a potential Super Rugby franchise in Hawai\u2019i or on the West Coast refuse to go away. Super Rugby Americas continues to thrive in South America, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine a Miami franchise, funded by an Argentine and steeped in Latin American culture, competing against teams in Buenos Aires and Santiago as opposed to Utah and New England. The United Rugby Championship (URC) has made no secret about its desire to host games in the U.S., so what is to stop it from establishing a U.S. club?\nThen there is the disruptive R360 project proposed by former England international Mike Tindall and funded by private investment from Saudi Arabia, the U.S., and the U.K.\nR360 has positioned itself as the answer to rugby union\u2019s problems. It will bring money, star power, and hype to the biggest cities across the world, ala Formula 1. According to reports from City AM, the eight-team league aims to be profitable by 2027 and has enough funding to go ahead with its inaugural season next year.\nBenson remains undisturbed by new leagues and exhibition matches coming to the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019re not concerned about any encroachment at this points,\u201d he told me over the phone. \u201cWe have ongoing conversations with the other leagues. More rugby is good. Having any kind of event that helps drive awareness of the sport is a positive.\"\nWith professional rugby clubs shuttering in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, there is no doubt that rugby\u2019s governing bodies must align themselves and search for new proposals that will drive revenue and deliver the best product on the field; however, allowing MLR to collapse, or worse, sewing the seeds of its destruction in favor of more immediate short-term returns in other competitions is a short-sighted move that will limit credible professional pathways in the U.S. and hamper rugby\u2019s American growth long-term.\nCan the league survive with just eight teams? Schedules and playoff formats will need to be adjusted but Benson certainly seems to think so. And if it does survive, how can ownership groups decrease operating budgets while increasing revenue and performance? Most importantly, how will the entire rugby ecosystem in the U.S. grow moving forward? These are questions that the owners, the fans, and rugby\u2019s governing bodies must find answers to."

  "argos_summary": "Paris Saint\u2011Germain\u2019s U.S. academies have teamed up with the French\u2011based highlight app Rematch to let fans capture and share user\u2011generated clips from games across six U.S. academies, embedding PSG branding and providing weekly highlight packages. Rematch, which uses AI\u2011powered rewind technology to auto\u2011capture the moments before a goal or try, has already amassed 700\u202fmillion views in France and 10.5\u202fmillion in the U.S. in its first six months, and plans a premium tier with higher\u2011quality footage. The partnership offers the academies free access to the app, content curation, social\u2011media collaboration, performance metrics and potential brand\u2011collaboration opportunities, with a discount for the six U.S. clubs. The article also notes PSG\u2019s strong 2023\u201124 financial results and touches on broader sports developments, including Major League Rugby\u2019s contraction and other partnership initiatives, but the core focus remains the PSG\u2011Rematch collaboration.
