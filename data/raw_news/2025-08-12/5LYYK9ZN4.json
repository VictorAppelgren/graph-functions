  "title": "Michigan\u2019s governor meets with Trump to deliver a message from the U.S. auto industry that he doesn\u2019t want to hear",
  "description": "In a private meeting, Whitmer told Trump that Michigan's auto industry would be severely impacted from his tariffs.",
  "content": "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer met privately in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump to make a case he did not want to hear: The automotive industry he said he wants to save was being hurt by his tariffs.\n\n\n\nThe Democrat came with a slide deck to make her points in a visual presentation. Just getting the meeting Tuesday with the Republican president was an achievement for someone viewed as a contender for her party\u2019s White House nomination in 2028.\n\n\n\nWhitmer\u2019s strategy for dealing with Trump highlights the conundrum for her and other Democratic leaders as they try to protect the interests of their states while voicing their opposition to his agenda. It\u2019s a dynamic that Whitmer has navigated much differently from many other Democratic governors.\n\n\n\nThe fact that Whitmer had \u201can opening to make direct appeals\u201d in private to Trump was unique in this political moment, said Matt Grossman, a Michigan State University politics professor.\n\n\n\nIt was her third meeting with Trump at the White House since he took office in January. This one, however, was far less public than the time in April when Whitmer was unwittingly part of an impromptu news conference that embarrassed her so much she covered her face with a folder.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, she told the president that the economic damage from the tariffs could be severe in Michigan, a state that helped deliver him the White House in 2024. Whitmer also brought up federal support for recovery efforts after an ice storm and sought to delay changes to Medicaid.\n\n\n\nTrump offered no specific commitments, according to people familiar with the private conversation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity to describe it.\n\n\n\nWhitmer is hardly the only one sounding the warning of the potentially damaging consequences, including factory job losses, lower profits and coming price increases, of the import taxes that Trump has said will be the economic salvation for American manufacturing.\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said no other president \u201chas taken a greater interest in restoring American auto industry dominance than President Trump.\u201d Trade frameworks negotiated by the administration would open up the Japanese, Korean and European markets for vehicles made on assembly lines in Michigan, Desai said.\n\n\n\nBut the outreach Trump has preferred tends to be splashy presentations by tech CEOs. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave the president a customized glass plaque with a gold base as Cook promised $600 billion in investments. Trump claims to have brought in $17 trillion in investment commitments, although none of those numbers has surfaced yet in economic data.\n\n\n\nUnder his series of executive orders and trade frameworks, U.S. automakers face import taxes of 50% on steel and aluminum, 30% on parts from China and a top rate of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered under an existing 2020 trade agreement. That puts America\u2019s automakers and parts suppliers at a disadvantage against German, Japanese and South Korean vehicles that only face a 15% import tax negotiated by Trump last month.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, Trump this past week threatened a 100% tariff on computer chips, which are an integral part of cars and trucks, though he would exclude companies that produce chips domestically from the tax.\n\n\n\nWhitmer\u2019s two earlier meetings with Trump resulted in gains for Michigan. But the tariffs represent a significantly broader request of a president who has imposed them even more aggressively in the face of criticism.\n\n\n\nMaterials in the presentation brought by Whitmer to the meeting and obtained by The Associated Press noted how trade with Canada and Mexico has driven $23.2 billion in investment to Michigan since 2020.\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors, Ford, and Stellantis operate 50 factories across the state, while more than 4,000 facilities support the auto parts supply chain. Altogether, the sector supports nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs, forming the backbone of Michigan\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\nWhitmer outlined the main points of the materials to Trump and left copies with his team.\n\n\n\nTo Grossman, the Michigan State professor, a key question is whether voters who expected to be helped by tariffs would react if Trump\u2019s import taxes failed to deliver the promised economic growth.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s aware that Michigan is a critical swing state and the auto industry has outsized influence, not just directly, but symbolically,\u201d Grossman said.\n\n\n\nAP VoteCast found that Trump won Michigan in 2024 largely because two-thirds of its voters described the economic conditions as being poor or \u201cnot so good.\u201d Roughly 70% of the voters in the state who felt negatively about the economy backed the Republican. The state was essentially split over whether tariffs were a positive, with Trump getting 76% of those voters who viewed them favorably.\n\n\n\nThe heads of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have repeatedly warned the administration that the tariffs would cut company profits and undermine their global competitiveness. Their efforts have resulted in little more than a temporary, monthlong pause intended to give companies time to adjust. The reprieve did little to blunt the financial fallout.\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter alone, Ford reported $800 million in tariff-related costs, while GM said the import taxes cost it $1.1 billion. Those expenses could make it harder to reinvest in new domestic factories, a goal Trump has championed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe expect tariffs to be a net headwind of about $2 billion this year, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor the developments closely and engage with policymakers to ensure U.S. autoworkers and customers are not disadvantaged by policy change,\u201d Ford CEO Jim Farley said on his company\u2019s earning call.\n\n\n\nSince Trump returned to the White House, Michigan has lost 7,500 manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\n\nSmaller suppliers have felt the strain, too.\n\n\n\nDetroit Axle, a family-run auto parts distributor, has been one of the more vocal companies in Michigan about the impact of the tariffs. The company initially announced it might have to shut down a warehouse and lay off more than 100 workers, but later said it would be able to keep the facility open, at least for now.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a market of who is able to survive, it\u2019s not a matter of who can thrive,\u201d said Mike Musheinesh, owner of Detroit Axle.",
