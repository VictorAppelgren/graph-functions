      "text": "The Sonos Arc has long stood as the flagship soundbar from the American networked audio giant. Upon its release in 2020, the Arc established itself as one of the most feature-rich products in its category. It was Sonos\u2019s first soundbar to support Dolby Atmos, which was a significant step forward at the time.\nFour years later, the Sonos Arc Ultra was released, intended to take up the mantle of a premium flagship soundbar. The Arc Ultra represents the next generation for Sonos, features breakthrough technologies like \u201cSound Motion,\u201d and adds Bluetooth support for the first time in any Sonos soundbar.\nIf you\u2019re in the market for an upscale soundbar, the new Buy at Amazon release presents an opportunity. With the Sonos Arc soon going the way of the dinosaurs, you\u2019re bound to see its remaining inventory undergo some steep sales. So, should you snatch one up for a bargain (or even find one used) or go with the latest and greatest? To help you make that decision, we\u2019ve compared the two generations of this premium product to see how much daylight there really is between them.\nDesign\nAt first glance, the Sonos Arc and Sonos Arc Ultra share remarkably similar form factors, making them difficult to distinguish from afar. The new Arc Ultra is just shy of a pound lighter than the original Arc, weighing just over 13 pounds compared to 13.8 pounds, and about half an inch thinner from top to bottom, measuring 2.9 inches in height versus 3.4 inches.\nThe Arc Ultra also measures roughly a quarter inch shallower than the Arc, with a depth of 4.3 inches compared to 4.6 inches, meaning it would stick out just a touch less from the wall when mounted. Overall, the newer generation carries a slimmer and more compact design, if only just.\nBoth models feature capacitive touch controls and are available in black and white finishes. If aesthetics are a priority for you in picking the perfect soundbar, you\u2019ll find little difference between these two.\nWinner: Tie\nSetup\nThe setup process for Sonos speakers is always a breeze, and truthfully, this is one of Sonos\u2019 greatest strengths. Once users have downloaded the Sonos app on their iOS or Android device, they will be walked through an uncomplicated set of steps and have their soundbar up and running in just a few minutes. This is also where users will be prompted to take advantage of features like Trueplay to optimize the soundbar\u2019s audio for the room it\u2019s being used in.\nWinner: Tie\nPerformance\nAs we began testing the sound and performance of the Sonos Arc Ultra, the upgrades from its predecessor became more apparent. Right off the bat, the Arc Ultra boasts 15 amplifiers, whereas the Arc has only 11.\nWhere the Arc featured just three silk-dome tweeters, the Arc Ultra has seven, which help deliver superior clarity and volume with less distortion. The added drivers also shine when watching content that supports Dolby Atmos. The Arc Ultra offers a spatial audio masterclass in 9.1.4 surround, while the Arc is limited to 5.0.2, lacking the additional height channels. For an even more immersive Atmos surround sound experience, add a pair of Sonos Era 300s as rear channels, and you will be blown away.\nOn the lower end, the original Arc used its eight elliptical woofers to handle both mids and lows; the new Arc Ultra divides up this work with six dedicated midwoofers and its new \u201cSound Motion\u201d system, composed of a four-motor, dual-membrane woofer serving as a dedicated driver for bass on the soundbar. This new design, in particular the addition of \u201cSound Motion\u201d and more immersive Dolby Atmos, yields a substantially refined sound with vastly improved bass performance.\nYou can, of course, add a Sonos Sub or Sub Mini for truly deep and room-filling low end, but both Sonos Arc soundbars deliver surprising bass \u2014 with the Ultra having a leg up.\nWinner: Sonos Arc Ultra\nFeatures\nSonos has often excelled at setting itself apart from competitors by offering products that are as feature-rich as they are user-friendly. From features like Trueplay tuning, which uses onboard microphones to optimize audio for the acoustics of the room, to its new Sound Motion tech, Sonos remains one of the most innovative players in the game.\nFor the purposes of comparison, the four years between the release of the Arc and the Arc Ultra were just enough to introduce a few added features with which the Arc Ultra sets itself apart yet again.\nFirstly, the Arc Ultra is the first soundbar from Sonos to support Bluetooth, making it that much easier to use your Arc Ultra as a dedicated speaker from various devices without having to connect to Wi-Fi or through the Sonos app.\nThe Arc Ultra also offers advanced speech enhancement settings, leveraging its added tweeters to highlight the frequencies most used by dialogue in television and film. This helps ensure clarity of dialogue even among complex soundscapes.\nThe Arc Ultra has added Trueplay support for users with Android devices, too, as the original Arc only supported this feature when setting up the soundbar with an iOS device. Both generations of the soundbar support a \u201cNight Sound\u201d mode, which reduces the volume of loud sounds while raising the volume of quieter sounds. Anyone who has tried watching an action-filled movie at night while their spouse is sleeping knows the pain of turning the volume up so that you can hear the quieter dialogue, only to have a blaringly loud scene suddenly wake the whole house.\nGiving some more thought to nighttime viewing, the Arc Ultra features something of an Easter egg for its sister product, the Sonos Ace headphones. Owners of both the Arc Ultra and the Ace headphones can seamlessly switch their audio between the two devices, though most smart TVs and streaming devices offer wireless headphone support as a standalone feature.\nWinner: Sonos Arc Ultra\nPrice\nThe Sonos Arc is likely to be discontinued soon, but it is still available directly from Sonos for $899 and can already be found for less than that at various online retailers like Buy at Amazon . It\u2019s likely that as stock dwindles, more aggressive sales will appear until all new units have been sold. The new Arc Ultra is available from Sonos and all major Buy at Amazon .\nLook around for the best sales, and you\u2019ll easily find the original Arc on sale for over $100 less than the Arc Ultra.\nWinner: Sonos Arc 1st Gen\nThe verdict\nThe Arc and Arc Ultra both exemplify the top-of-the-line soundbars in their respective eras. The original Arc endures as an impressive speaker with its support for Dolby Atmos, Trueplay tuning, and 11 high-end drivers, though the reality remains that four years in the world of consumer gadgets can feel like a lifetime in terms of features and performance.\nWith an MSRP of just $100 more, the Arc Ultra delivers improved sound with a dedicated bass driver, a 9.1.4 Dolby Atmos setup that feels far more future-proof, improved dialogue enhancement, added Bluetooth capability, and expanded Android support that all make it worth the splurge for the newest tech. If you\u2019re looking for a great deal on a top-notch soundbar, then by all means, keep your eyes peeled for an aggressive sale on the original Arc, but if $100 is all that separates the old from the new, then the Sonos Arc Ultra is the way to go."

      "text": "- Excellent surround sound\n- Easy and simple setup\n- Decent Dolby Atmos from a single speaker\n- Choice of Alexa or Google Assistant\n- No HDMI inputs\n- Not ideal for all music genres\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nWhen Sonos debuted its first soundbar, the $699 Playbar in 2013, it received well-deserved praise. As a dead-simple, but somewhat pricey way to give your TV a massive audio upgrade, it succeeded on just about all but one front: The decision on Sonos\u2019 part to equip the Playbar with a single optical input meant the Playbar would forever be locked out of the expanding world of surround formats like Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and Dolby Atmos \u2014 something reviewers noted at the time as a drawback to an otherwise superb product.\nSeven years later, Sonos has returned to the full-size home theater soundbar arena with the $799 Arc, a Dolby Atmos-capable speaker that shows off everything the company has learned since the Playbar\u2019s debut. Did Sonos push the envelope far enough this time, or has it simply played catchup? Let\u2019s take a look.\nGorgeous design\nI\u2019ve said before that when it comes to soundbars, the best designs draw no attention to themselves at all. After all, your visual focus should be on your TV, not your soundbar.\nWhether your primary aesthetic is low-key Darth Vader or low-key Stormtrooper, there\u2019s a Sonos Arc to suit your tastes\nBut just because a soundbar shouldn\u2019t compete with what\u2019s on-screen, that doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be a boring slab of plastic. In classic Sonos fashion, the Arc manages to exude a subtle elegance when it\u2019s not acting as your TV\u2019s partner and then disappears almost entirely when it\u2019s time to dim the lights and start the show.\nI credit this chameleon-like performance to our review unit\u2019s matte black finish. It worked for me \u2014 though, for the first time, Sonos also has a full-size soundbar you can also buy in matte white. Whether your primary aesthetic is low-key Darth Vader or low-key Stormtrooper, there\u2019s a Sonos Arc to suit your tastes.\nThe design of the single-piece wrap-around speaker grille comprised of hundreds of tiny holes gives the Arc the same understated monolithic look as the company\u2019s other recent products, such as the Move, Sonos One, One SL, and the updated Sonos Five.\nSonos has placed the Arc\u2019s touch controls on the top of the soundbar, which feels like a more logical position than the Playbar\u2019s more awkward side controls. However, this placement means that sliding the Arc fully underneath your TV will make these controls difficult or impossible to get to. That might not matter though as, with all Sonos products, you can control the speaker entirely from your phone, tablet, or computer.\nJust like with the Playbar, you can sit the Arc in front of your TV, where you\u2019ll need at least 2.5 inches of clearance if you want it to sit directly under the screen. It can also be wall-mounted, but be prepared for some sticker shock: The optional steel bracket is a whopping $80 \u2014 a full 10% of the price of the Arc itself.\nLimited connectivity\nSonos prides itself on its commitment to simplicity and the Arc embodies that fully with its extremely easy set-up: A single HDMI ARC/eARC port on the rear of the speaker is all you need to connect it to your TV. Just plug one end of the included HDMI cable into that port, plug the other end into your TV\u2019s HDMI ARC/eARC port, plug the power cable in, and you\u2019re essentially good to go.\nThe rest of the setup process happens in the Sonos app. It only takes a few minutes and includes Sonos\u2019 Trueplay tuning feature. Trueplay is how Sonos gains an understanding of your room\u2019s acoustics. It can then optimize the Arc\u2019s EQ for better music and presumably, better Dolby Atmos. Trouble is, Trueplay is an iOS-only feature that requires the microphone on an iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. Android users are out of luck.\nSonos points out that you can always borrow an iOS device to Trueplay your system, but that seems like cold comfort for those who have chosen to stay out of Apple\u2019s well-manicured but walled garden.\nSonos prides itself on its commitment to simplicity and the Arc couldn\u2019t be simpler to set up and use.\nIronically, Sonos\u2019 desire to keep things simple has created a degree of inconvenience, too. HDMI ARC/eARC is a terrific concept because it lets you send digital audio and video to your TV while simultaneously letting your TV send digital audio back to your soundbar or AV receiver. But the Sonos Arc hogs that connection for itself, turning it into an audio-out port only.\nThat\u2019s because the Arc, unlike a lot of soundbars on the market, doesn\u2019t have an HDMI input. All of your source devices, such as game consoles, cable boxes, streaming media devices, or Blu-ray players must connect directly to one of your TV\u2019s other HDMI inputs, which creates three potential problems.\nFirst, unless your source device is a stick-style gadget like a Fire TV Stick, you will need to run one HDMI cable per device to your TV \u2014 in addition to the HDMI cable the Arc requires. Depending on your home theater installation, that could be tricky.\nSecond, few TVs ship with more than four HDMI inputs. Once you\u2019ve connected the Arc, you\u2019re down to three. If three inputs aren\u2019t enough, you\u2019re going to need an HDMI switcher to convert one of those three into two or more additional ports.\nIf you can get by with just three ports (or if your TV happens to have more than four to start with) and you don\u2019t mind running a few more HDMI cables, then don\u2019t give this another thought. If, on the other hand, you were hoping to replace a six- or seven-input AV receiver with the Arc, you\u2019ll need to do some homework before placing your order.\nThird, because the Arc can only receive audio via your TV, the audio it receives will be dependent on what your TV supports. Not all TVs support Dolby Atmos, for instance, so if you connect an Apple TV 4K to a TV that isn\u2019t capable of passing along Doby Atmos over HDMI ARC, the Sonos Arc will likely end up getting regular Dolby Digital 5.1. Without a direct HDMI input, the Arc remains forever at the mercy of its TV counterpart.\nI should note that if your TV doesn\u2019t have HDMI ARC at all, you can use the included optical-to-HDMI adapter, but you won\u2019t be able to receive Dolby Digital Plus or Dolby TrueHD, and thus, no Dolby Atmos. Dolby Digital 5.1 will still sound amazing, but it doesn\u2019t take advantage of the Arc\u2019s full range.\nWhen Sonos released the Arc, it wasn\u2019t compatible with LPCM multi-channel sound \u2014 a problem for those with devices that rely on this format, like the Nintendo Switch. But as of November 2020, Sonos has released a firmware update that turns on LPCM support.\nSensational surround sound\nJust like every other speaker Sonos makes, the Arc manages to deliver a bigger and richer sound than its compact housing suggests. Bass \u2014 the key ingredient for home theater sound \u2014 is remarkably thunderous for a soundbar. The uninitiated will look around the room in search of the subwoofer that simply isn\u2019t there.\nEqually impressive is the Arc\u2019s ability to reproduce dialogue. It\u2019s clear and precise, even without engaging the optional dialog-enhancement mode. That\u2019s a testament to Sonos\u2019 understanding of what makes watching TV enjoyable. You can have the most immersive multichannel sound system on the planet, but if you can\u2019t understand what the actors are saying because of muddy dialogue, your viewing experience will be significantly damaged.\nBass \u2014 the key ingredient for home theater sound \u2014 is remarkably thunderous for a soundbar.\nThanks to its upward-firing height channel drivers and its phased speaker array, the Arc also creates an expansive soundstage, making it an ideal single-speaker solution for way better TV audio.\nMost people will end up using the Arc with Dolby Audio in either 2-channel stereo or 5.1 audio because these two formats represent the majority of available streaming and broadcast content. The Arc does a great job with both, easily filling even larger rooms with expansive, thrilling sound.\nEntry-level Dolby Atmos\nThat same stellar audio experience is true for the Arc\u2019s headline feature, Dolby Atmos, but you will need to temper your expectations a little. The Arc uses a pair of upward-firing speakers to reflect the \u201cheight\u201d portion of a Dolby Atmos soundtrack back to your viewing position. It\u2019s the same technique used by all Atmos-capable soundbars and even some dedicated Atmos speakers.\nThe effectiveness will be very dependent on the geometry of your room. In my basement TV room, with 7.5-foot ceilings, I was definitely aware of the increased sense of 3D space, but it was a subtle effect rather than something that grabs you by the lapels. There\u2019s no visual indicator on the Arc that lets you know you\u2019re listening to Dolby Atmos, but a quick glance at the app will provide confirmation if you\u2019re not sure.\nI tested the Arc\u2019s Atmos chops with recent action-oriented favorites like Ford v Ferrari, Avengers: Endgame, and John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum. Whether it\u2019s roaring race cars, thundering spaceships, or ricocheting bullets, the Arc can help put you front and center for all of the action.\nIf you find that the Arc\u2019s height channel reproduction feels weak, perhaps because of the shape or angle of your ceiling or your distance to the soundbar, you can adjust the volume level of the upward-firing drivers. This ability was added via a software update that Sonos released on May 12, 2021. I haven\u2019t had a chance to test this new setting, so your mileage may vary.\nAt the moment, the Arc only supports Dolby Atmos, not DTS:X, which offers a similarly immersive experience to Atmos but is not as well-supported by Blu-rays or streaming services. If DTS:X support matters to you, check out the excellent Vizio Elevate soundbar, which supports both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nAdding a sub and surrounds\nI think the Sonos Arc is terrific on its own, but if what you seek is an even bigger and better sound, you can have it. Sonos lets you expand the Arc\u2019s capabilities by adding a $699 Sonos Sub, and you can use any matched pair of Sonos speakers as your surround satellites \u2014 even a pair of $99 Ikea Symfonisk Bookshelf speakers.\nI recommend both upgrades. The Sub will take the Arc\u2019s impressive bass from good to gargantuan (and it\u2019s the only subwoofer that is compatible with the Arc), while a pair of surrounds will help the Arc fill in some of those sounds that it can\u2019t quite reproduce by bouncing audio toward you. I tried it with a set of Sonos One SLs \u2014 which was amazing \u2014 but I believe any pair of Sonos speakers would give the Arc a helpful boost.\nMusic performance\nSoundbars are first and foremost about delivering better TV audio, but the Arc isn\u2019t just a soundbar. As a full Sonos speaker, you get all of the benefits of the Sonos system: A brilliant mobile app that gives you total control over your music sources, your speakers, and indeed, your whole home should you wish to expand into multi-room audio.\nIf you need your soundbar to perform double duty as your primary source of music, the Arc can do it. The only caveat here is that because the Arc is tuned to deliver optimal results for TV audio, it doesn\u2019t possess the same sound signature as other kinds of speakers, or even other Sonos speakers. The same emphasis on higher frequencies and lower frequencies that make for such compelling movie magic, don\u2019t always mesh well with all music genres.\nVocal-forward tracks by Adele, for instance, are definitely enhanced. Billie Eilish\u2019s Bond theme, No Time To Die is another example of a track that benefits from the Arc\u2019s theater-inspired acoustics. But jazz standards, classical compositions, and even some straight-up pop and rock songs can feel a bit trapped by a lack of definition through the midranges.\nAtmos Music\nHowever, there is a caveat to my caveat: Dolby Atmos Music. As luck would have it, Tidal added the ability to stream Dolby Atmos Music from its Apple TV 4K app the same week I was wrapping up my time with the Sonos Arc.\nDolby Atmos Music on the Arc is a joy. Tracks that have been mastered in Atmos Music (or remastered in it) can, depending on the song, give you an entirely new appreciation of the music. A fabulous example is The Doors\u2019 classic Riders On The Storm. The rain and thunder that have always felt underwhelming to me when listening in stereo, suddenly become an intimate and essential part of the music. Jim Morrison\u2019s already haunting lyrics and vocals get a shiver-inducing ghostly echo after lines like \u201cThere\u2019s a killer on the road.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if those elements have always been a part of the song or not, but with the combination of Atmos Music and the Arc, you can\u2019t ignore them. Not every Atmos Music track is equally mesmerizing, but if you can afford the $20 per month Tidal HiFi subscription tier, and you have a compatible streaming device, I highly recommend it.\nAirPlay 2 and voice assistants\nThe Sonos Arc doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth \u2014 a feature that almost every other soundbar has \u2014 so you won\u2019t be able to connect to it directly from your phone. Instead, you can use Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 technology to connect from your Apple device over Wi-Fi. As much as this may frustrate Android users, in practice, there\u2019s only one situation where it will be an issue: Playing music that only lives on your Android device.\nThe Arc also benefits from Sonos\u2019 agnostic approach to voice assistants. You can choose to use either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, though only one at a time. The Sonos Arc and Beam used to be the only smart soundbars to provide this choice, but Bose now offers a similar choice for its Smart Soundbars.\nI had some trouble getting Google Assistant set up, but I\u2019ll chalk that up to the beta software I was using. Alexa worked flawlessly.\nHaving a voice assistant in a soundbar is actually a pretty big deal. Beyond the obvious benefits of a smart speaker (playing music, controlling smart home devices, and getting answers to your questions), because the Arc is connected to your TV via HDMI, you can use a variety of voice commands to turn the TV on and off or adjust the volume. Your specific TV may support even more commands depending on the model and whether it\u2019s compatible with Google Assistant or Alexa.\nOur take\nThe $799 Sonos Arc is the home theater upgrade that Sonos fans have been waiting for. It delivers superb surround sound, a good if subtle Dolby Atmos experience, plus all of the benefits of a smart speaker and Sonos\u2019 unique multiroom audio system. Only its lack of HDMI inputs and slightly compromised music quality keep it from being a perfect soundbar for the price.\nIs there a better alternative?\nIf what you want is an Atmos-capable soundbar with a choice of voice assistants and the ultimate flexibility of Sonos\u2019 multiroom audio system, there simply isn\u2019t a second option at any price.\nIf you love the idea of a Sonos Dolby Atmos soundbar but would prefer not to have a microphone in your living room, the Costco-only Sonos Arc SL delivers that option, for $50 less than the regular Arc.\nIf you\u2019re willing to forgo Dolby Atmos, the Bose Soundbar 700 is the same price and does a better job with music reproduction (though it can\u2019t do Atmos Music). You get the same choice of voice assistants, and the ability to add wireless accessories like subwoofers and surround speakers, but the Bose app doesn\u2019t offer anywhere near the multiroom audio control or the superb universal search of the Sonos app.\nIf you\u2019re willing to get into multiple speaker units, you can get a more convincing Dolby Atmos experience. Our top picks from this category are:\n- Vizio\u2019s $700 5.1.4 system\n- The $1,000 Vizio Elevate\n- Or, for even more punch, you can pick up the LG SN11RG for $1,700\nAll three have multiple HDMI inputs, too.\nHow long will it last?\nDespite the fact that Sonos recently ended support for some older devices, you can expect the Arc to last for years, if not decades. Sonos products are well-built, and the Arc is no exception.\nShould you buy it?\nYes. For Sonos users, the Sonos Arc is an absolute no-brainer. It\u2019s just $100 more than the Playbar it replaces, yet it offers better sound, Dolby Atmos, AirPlay 2, voice assistants, and more. As long as you\u2019re OK with having to use your TV\u2019s HDMI inputs or an HDMI switcher to connect your video sources, the Arc will reward you with terrific home theater audio for under $1,000."

      "text": "With the demands of modern PC games, no less than one of the best graphics cards will do, preferably in partnership with one of the best processors. We've reviewed dozens of GPUs and spent over 200 hours benchmarking them, and these are the cards that we've tested and can still swear by despite the current state of the GPU market.\nGraphics cards are not cheap right now, but the models listed below remain competitive. Some are pricier than they were at launch, but we hand-picked the ones that are still readily available and worth your money. With Nvidia's RTX 50-series, AMD's RDNA 4, and Intel's Arc Battlemage out in full swing, we're spoiled for choice, and it's all a matter of hunting down a good deal selling close to the recommended list price (MSRP).\nThese are the graphics cards I recommend today, based on hours of in-house testing.\nThe most powerful graphics card\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090\n- Unrivaled 4K gaming performance\n- Innovative, attractive Founder's Edition design\n- DisplayPort 2.1 and 4:2:2 encoding\n- 32GB of memory for AI workloads\n- DLSS 4 is a treat...\n- ...when it works properly\n- Insanely expensive\n- Power requirements are off the charts\n| Specification: | |\n| VRAM | 32GB GDDR7 |\n| Power requirements | 575 watts |\n| Architecture | Blackwell |\nWhy should you buy this: It's the most powerful graphics card money can buy.\nWho's it for: Enthusiasts who don't mind spending up for the best of the best.\nWhat we thought of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090:\nThe RTX 5090 is the most ridiculous graphics card Nvidia has ever released. I'm still shocked by its performance. At 4K, I measured frame rates that are on average 30% higher than the RTX 4090, and that's before you factor in the new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation feature that's available on Nvidia's RTX 50-series graphics cards.\nAlthough Nvidia takes the crown in gaming, the RTX 5090 is suited for a ton of other workloads, too. With 32GB of GDDR7 memory, it allows you to dip your toe into training AI language models, and with DisplayPort 2.1 and 4:2:2 encoding, it's a great option for media production. For me, it's the design that stands out most, however. Nvidia developer a flow-through design for its Founder's Edition model, allowing the company to shrink this graphics card down to only two slots.\nThis is all great, but the RTX 5090 also comes in at $2,000 to start with, and it hardly ever sells for less than $2,800. Some models go over $4,000. It's the most expensive graphics card Nvidia has ever released, and for most people, it's just too expensive. If you want the best of the best, though, Nvidia is delivering it with the RTX 5090.\nThe best value graphics card\nIntel Arc B580\n- Lower price than AMD and Nvidia alternatives\n- 12GB of VRAM\n- XeSS 2 support\n- Incredible performance for the price\n- Occasional driver issues\n- 190W is a lot for a budget GPU\n| Specification: | |\n| VRAM | 12GB GDDR6 |\n| Power requirements | 190 watts |\n| Architecture | Battlemage |\nWhy should you buy this: It's a powerful graphics card that has no business being as inexpensive as it is.\nWho's it for: Gamers who want solid performance under $280.\nWhat we thought of the Intel Arc B580:\nI'm shocked the Arc B580 is as good as it is. It comes in at $250, but is usually sold at a higher price, hovering around $280. One way or another, it has no business being that inexpensive. Based on my testing, it's a clean 9% faster than Nvidia's RTX 4060 at 1080p, and a massive 18% faster at 1440p. This is a graphics card that not only goes toe-to-toe with Nvidia and AMD on performance. It also comes in at a much cheaper price.\nTo me, the Arc B580 feels like a course correction. The market for $250 graphics cards has been woefully underserved for the past few years, but Intel is delivering a GPU with the Arc B580 in that price bracket that's compelling. It's a solid performer, but more than that, it's a capable modern GPU with good ray tracing performance, 12GB of VRAM, and even frame generation support with XeSS 2.\nIntel's discrete graphics business is still fairly young, but if I was building a budget PC today, it'd be hard to argue with what the Arc B580 offers. It's capable of just about anything at 1080p, and based on my testing, it even has enough grunt to go up to 1440p. The fact that it's actually cheaper than the competition is just the cherry on top.\nThe best graphics card for gaming\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super\n- Solid performance improvement over RTX 4070\n- Still highly efficient\n- DLSS 3.5\n- Fantastic ray tracing performance\n- Great value\n- Only minor uplifts in a few games\n- 12GB of VRAM may limit some ray-traced titles at 4K\n| Specification: | |\n| VRAM | 12GB GDDR6X |\n| Power requirements | 200 watts |\n| Architecture | Ada Lovelace |\nWhy should you buy this: It's much faster than the original model, and comparable to the RTX 5070.\nWho's it for: Midrange gamers looking for a GPU that can handle the most demanding games at 1440p.\nWhat we thought of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super:\nThe RTX 4070 was already a great graphics card, but the RTX 4070 Super is even better. This new version is between 10% and 15% faster than the base model based on our testing, and it still comes with all of the features that made the original version so impressive.\nNow, you're getting frame rates at the target resolution that are consistently above 100 fps, and often much more. On top of that the RTX 4070 Super has enough power to press up to 4K, assuming you make a few compromises in the most demanding games. It's the Swiss Army Knife of graphics cards, filling its duty as a gaming workhorse in just about any situation. It even manages to beat AMD's RX 7800 XT, though it's more expensive, and difficult to come by now that newer models are already out. If you can't buy this one near MSRP, go for the RTX 5070 instead.\nIt comes with Nvidia's excellent DLSS 3.5, as well. It's a huge asset in games like Alan Wake 2 with path tracing turned on, and it can make demanding games more playable at 4K. Between DLSS 3, solid raw performance, and an attainable price, the RTX 4070 Super nails a sweet spot that most graphics cards miss.\nThe best AMD graphics card for 4K gaming\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX\n- Fantastic value for the RX 7900 XTX\n- Playable ray tracing performance\n- High refresh rate 4K gaming\n- Standard 8-pin power\n- Disappointing generational improvements\n- Loud and hot\n| Specification: | |\n| VRAM | 24GB GDDR6 |\n| Power requirements | 355 watts |\n| Architecture | RDNA 3 |\nWhy should you buy this: It offers some of the best 4K gaming performance you can find today, and at a reasonable price.\nWho\u2019s it for: High-end gamers who need high frame rates, but don't care much about ray tracing.\nWhat we thought of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX:\nThe lineup of current-gen GPUs all have one thing in common: they're expensive. That makes choosing the best GPU tough, but dipping back into the previous generation is still a viable option. The RX 7900 XTX offers flagship performance at an excellent value amid the inflated landscape of GPU prices right now.\nFor raw performance, the RX 7900 XTX is capable of running the most demanding PC games above 60 frames per second (fps), and in the case of titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn, it can even hit around 100 fps. The RX 7900 XTX compares favorably with the RTX 4080 Super, and it's currently around $300 cheaper due to varying stock levels.\nIn addition, it's smaller, and it calls for standard 8-pin power rather than the 12-pin connector featured on Nvidia's most recent GPUs. That doesn't mean the RX 7900 XTX is without faults. It gets loud and it runs hot and compared to Nvidia, it lacks prowess in ray tracing games.\nEven with those caveats, the RX 7900 XTX is an excellent graphics card that can power high-end gaming in demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077.\nThe best graphics card for 1440p\nAMD RX 7700 XT\n- Reasonably priced\n- 100-plus fps at 1440p\n- Solid ray tracing performance\n- Plenty of VRAM\n- Standard 8-pin power\n- No DLSS\n- Still weaker than Nvidia with ray tracing\n| Specification: | |\n| VRAM | 12GB GDDR6 |\n| Power requirements | 245 watts |\n| Architecture | RDNA 3 |\nWhy should you buy this: It's a solid midrange card, even with newer options available.\nWho's it for: Gamers who want 1440p gaming in the triple digits without breaking the bank.\nWhat we thought of the AMD RX 7700 XT:\nThe RX 7700 XT is still a solid buy -- arguably better than it was at launch. You can find it for around $400, which is a great price considering the performance. Our comparison of the AMD RX 7700 XT and Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti found the RX 7700 XT to be around 23% faster than Nvidia's GPU, and that includes games with ray tracing.\nAlthough Nvidia has some excellent GPUs at other price points this generation, there aren't a ton of options around $400. The RX 7700 XT fills that gap, but there are other options around the same price, such as the RX 9060 XT 16GB or the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB. We recommend steering clear of the cheaper 8GB equivalents of those graphics cards.\nThe RX 7700 XT is best if you're on a strict budget, however. A slightly more expensive card like the RX 5060 Ti 16GB or the RTX 5070 gains you a lot of extra performance at 1440p. For those trying to stay under $400, though, nothing beats the RX 7700 XT.\nThe best graphics card for VR\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\n- DisplayPort 2.1 support\n- Powerful 4K gaming\n- Relatively small\n- Disappointing generational improvements\n- Loud and hot\n| Specification: | |\n| VRAM | 20GB GDDR6 |\n| Power requirements | 300 watts |\n| Architecture | RDNA 3 |\nWhy should you buy this: It's a powerful 4K GPU, and it supports DisplayPort 2.1 for high-end VR headsets.\nWho's it for: VR enthusiasts who want to drive high-end headsets.\nWhat we thought of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT:\nThe AMD RX 7900 XT wasn't a great GPU when it released, but it's become much better since. It's seen a wave of price drops, bringing the $900 list price down to around $680. It's a great buy at that price, espeically if you're in the market for high-end VR gaming.\nThe big reason the RX 7900 XT stands out so much is its DisplayPort 2.1 support. High-end VR headsets often come with insane resolutions and refresh rates, which require DisplayPort 2.1. The RX 7900 XT is able to work with these headsets due to its connection.\nIt's no slouch of a GPU, either. Although the RX 7900 XTX is more powerful for 4K, the RX 7900 XT has enough grunt to play most demanding games at 4K and 60 fps. You may have to turn down settings in a few titles, but those situations should be few and far between. However, this GPU has a lot of competition in the RX 9070 XT, which sells for a similar price right now -- but this one gives you 20GB VRAM, which is a nice benefit.\nThe best graphics card for laptops\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 mobile\n- Available in a ton of laptops\n- DLSS 3.5 support\n- Efficient enough for thin and light machines\n- A little expensive\n- Struggles at 4K\n| Specification: | |\n| VRAM | 8GB GDDR6 |\n| Power requirements | 115 watts |\n| Architecture | Ada Lovelace |\nWhy should you buy this: It's the sweet spot of Nvidia's last-gen mobile lineup of GPUs.\nWho's it for: Gamers on the go that need the perfect balance of power.\nWhat we thought of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 mobile:\nIf you want the ultimate mobile gaming experience, it's hard to beat the RTX 4070 mobile. It's not the fastest laptop graphics card Nvidia currently offers, but it's by far the best. It's available in a massive number of laptops, including the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 and Razer Blade 14, and all of them offer great performance at a 1440p resolution.\nWhat's most impressive about the RTX 4070 mobile, however, is that it's scalable. You can pump it with power in a large, 16-inch laptop for a small performance boost, but the efficiency of the GPU means it has a home in thinner machines like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.\nIt also has access to DLSS 3.5, making things like ray tracing possible on a laptop. You won't find the RTX 4070 available in more budget-focused machines, but if you have the cash to spare, it definitely strikes the perfect balance of efficiency and power for a laptop. You can also safely shop for laptops with the RTX 5070, which often come at comparable prices.\nWhat to consider\nWhen choosing the best graphics card for your PC, there are a few important things to keep in mind. First and foremost, check you really need to upgrade. Take the time to identify what graphics card you have installed already.\nPricing\nAs a rule of thumb, you should dedicate about 30% of your budget to a graphics card for a gaming PC. For 1080p, you should spend around $300 to $400; for 1440p, around $400 to $500; and for 4K, $600 or above. Unfortunately, the current pricing throws those figures for a spin, so you may have to prepare to spend up to $500 for 1080p, $800 for 1440p, and well over $1,000 for a comfortable 4K.\nPower draw\nNvidia and AMD recommend power supply wattage for their most recent graphics card. The Radeon RX 7800 XT, for example, draws 263W of power and AMD recommends a 600W PSU at least. Similarly, the GeForce RTX 4080 video card draws 360W and Nvidia recommends a 850W PSU. These recommendations aren't always perfect, though, so we recommend using a PSU calculator. If you are planning to overclock your GPU, this will also affect power draw, so factor this in.\nResolution and game needs\nFinding the graphics card that will best suit your needs comes down to the resolution of your display and the kinds of games you play. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is great for 4K, for example, but it's overkill for 1080p where the AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT shines. The lower your display's resolution, the less you need to spend on a graphics card.\nBeyond that, consider the games you want to play and at what frame rates. You can use the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super for everything from Counter-Strike 2 to Borderlands 3, but you might need to step up to the GeForce RTX 4060 to play games like Cyberpunk 2077.\nHow we tested\nEvery graphics card we recommend is run through a rigorous series of tests by our team of GPU experts, including Jacob Roach and Kunal Khullar. It takes anywhere from 24-48 hours to test one graphics card, assessing performance, checking the GPU temperature, and our reviewers are constantly re-running tests on current-gen graphics cards to make sure our results are always up to date. Here, we focused on surfacing the graphics cards that meet the performance and value mark based on our list of tests as of the most recent pass.\nWhy trust us\nDigital Trends has been publishing PC component reviews for years. Our reporters bring more than a decade of experience with PC hardware. Our goal is to bring you the best GPU recommendations through first-hand testing and experience, balancing the objective data with the subjective experience of using the product day after day."

Google Home and Apple Home are its two biggest competitors \u2014 and all three are great options for running your smart home. But what exactly is Amazon Alexa? And how can it help you streamline your life? From how to use Alexa and why you would choose Alexa for your smart home, here\u2019s a closer look at this innovative assistant.\nWho/what is Alexa?\nFor most people, all you really have to know about Alexa is that it\u2019s the name of the voice that comes out of Alexa-enabled speakers. Basically, Alexa is to Amazon what Siri is to Apple. Alexa is a voice that you can ask questions to and get answers, such as \u201cWhat is the weather today in Chicago?\u201d Alexa has been integrated into many of Amazon\u2019s services and can be used with products such as the original Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Spot, Echo Show, or Amazon Fire TV.\nBut really, what exactly is Alexa? When you ask Alexa a question, what you\u2019re doing is communicating with a cloud-based service. Amazon has designed the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) to mimic real conversations, but you\u2019re actually using intuitive voice commands to get this service to perform specific tasks. \u201cAlexa\u201d is simply the \u201cwake word\u201d that alerts the service to start listening to your voice. For most devices, you just have to say the wake word to get a response.\nAccording to Amazon\u2019s Developer site, the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) lives in the cloud. Amazon\u2019s AVS is an intelligent voice recognition and natural language understanding service. The service can be used to voice-enable any connected device that has a microphone and speaker. That\u2019s why you\u2019re starting to see Alexa in headphones and other devices. \u201cAlexa is always getting smarter with new capabilities through machine learning,\u201d Amazon\u2019s Developer site reads.\nWhile Alexa is the official name for Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, you can change this wake word to \u201cAmazon,\u201d \u201cComputer,\u201d or \u201cEcho.\u201d That\u2019s a useful feature, especially if your name or your partner\u2019s or roommate\u2019s name happens to be Alexa or something that sounds similar.\nWhy Alexa?\nApple has Siri. Google Home has the Google Assistant, which comes alive when you say \u201cOK, Google.\u201d Amazon has Alexa. But why? According to David Limp, the Amazon executive who oversaw the development of the service, the name \u201cAlexa\u201d was chosen for a few reasons. First, the name \u201cAlexa\u201d harks back to the Library of Alexandria, which attempted to collect all of the world\u2019s knowledge. Amazon is attempting to do the same thing. Alexa is always learning but, in theory, it should be a seamless source of information.\nMore practically, the service was named Alexa because it contains the uncommon \u201cX\u201d sound. Since this service is voice-activated, Amazon wanted to choose a name that wouldn\u2019t get confused with other words that could accidentally awaken the device:\n\u201cWe did go through a number of names and the name is important as much for the personality that it creates around the persona than is this computer-based voice computer in the cloud. But there\u2019s computer science behind it, too,\u201d Limp said. \u201cIf any of you have Echoes, you know that it only wakes up when it hears the word \u2018Alexa,\u2019 and the phonics of that word and how that word is parsed, and the fact that it has a hard consonant with the \u2018X\u2019 in it, is important in making sure that it wakes up only when it\u2019s asked for. And so, a combination of those two things allowed us to kind of narrow in on Alexa.\u201d\nWhere can I use Alexa?\nIn order to use Alexa, you\u2019ll need a device that integrates voice technology. This typically means an Amazon device, such as an Echo, Echo Dot, or Echo Show, but this cloud-based personal voice assistant has also been integrated into the Echo Auto, and with some third-party systems. Devices like the Fire TV are also compatible with Alexa, as are some third-party devices such as the Sonos One. Someone even programmed Alexa to work with a Big Mouth Billy Bass.\nAlexa has also become the center of many smart-home systems, including Wink, SmartThings, and the Logitech Harmony. You can also use the voice assistant to build your smart home piecemeal, as Alexa can pair with hubless devices such as WeMo switches and Nest thermostats. And now that many Echo devices support Matter, it can interact with a wide variety of smart home gadgets. You can also use it directly on your phone via an app, so you don\u2019t have to invest in third-party gadgets to enjoy the voice assistant\u2019s company.\nHere is a list of the best smart home devices compatible with Alexa.\nWhat can Alexa do?\nThe list of commands Alexa can understand seems to grow on a daily basis. Amazon calls these \u201cskills,\u201d and you can even create your own skills through Amazon Blueprints. Upon review from Amazon, you can even publish your own skills in the Amazon Skills Store for other people to use on their Alexa devices. The number of tasks that Alexa can accomplish is clearly more than we can list in this article, so be sure to check out our roundup of the best Alexa skills.\nIn addition, Alexa is also useful in helping people establish bedtime and morning routines. You only need to assign a command, and that specific command can trigger a series of events. For instance, if you were to say, \u201cAlexa, goodnight,\u201d it could trigger the machine to turn all house lights off, arm the security system, and turn on an ambient noise machine simultaneously. You can make your routine pretty specific, too; If you\u2019d like, you could program Alexa to turn on your preferred lights, wait 10 minutes, and then turn on the coffee pot. If you get up earlier than your partner does, you can use Alexa\u2019s whisper mode, so it communicates back in a whisper and listens explicitly for your whispers. You can learn how to set up routines in our how-to guide.\nAmazon is constantly working to improve and expand Alexa\u2019s functions and capabilities by creating valuable and intuitive technology. For example, the company is currently working to roll out frustration-detection features, so Alexa will be able to understand your tone and figure out if you\u2019re getting frustrated with it. If you want to learn about some more of these new Alexa features, simply ask, \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s new with you?\u201d and it\u2019s happy to share.\nAlso interested in Apple Home? Here\u2019s a detailed comparison of Apple Home vs. Amazon Alexa to help you figure out which is best for your smart home."

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nBy any measure, it\u2019s been a lousy year for Sonos. The company\u2019s much-anticipated entry into wireless headphones \u2014 the Sonos Ace \u2014 should have been a triumphant moment (the Ace are very good). Unfortunately, the Ace\u2019s debut was overshadowed by a botched app update, which continues to dog the company despite a slew of patches that have largely (but not totally) fixed the problems.\nThe app fiasco cast such a pall over the company\u2019s normally ebullient new product launches that Sonos announced its new flagship Dolby Atmos soundbar \u2014 the $999 Sonos Arc Ultra \u2014 not with a splashy in-person press event, but with a press release.\nI know that Sonos\u2019 wounds are 100% self-inflicted, but I can\u2019t help feeling bad for the folks who brought the Arc Ultra into existence because, just like the Sonos Ace, it\u2019s a really good audio product.\nIt\u2019s not perfect \u2014 I\u2019ll touch on some of its weaknesses in a moment \u2014 and it\u2019s not a massive step up from the original Arc (which it replaces), but there\u2019s an undeniable improvement in sound quality that makes the Ultra worth the extra $100 \u2014 especially if you\u2019re already all-in on Sonos.\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Sonos Arc, the Arc Ultra is nearly identical. It comes in the two standard Sonos colors (black and white) and its dimensions make it hard to tell the two apart at a distance. At 46.3 inches in width, the Ultra is only about two inches wider than the Arc, and yet it\u2019s shorter, with a height of 2.9 inches instead of the original\u2019s 3.4 inches. The Ultra is even a little shallower.\nThe all-matte-plastic, cylindrical body and integrated grille preserve what is arguably one of the best-looking soundbar designs. Where most people will notice a difference is the new central housing. It acts as a plinth, creating the effect \u2014 when seen from the front \u2014 that the cylinder\u2019s \u201cwings\u201d are floating a few millimeters above the surface.\nThat housing is also where you\u2019ll find the touch controls. In keeping with Sonos\u2019 most recent speakers (the Era 100, Era 300, and Move 2), these now include a dedicated volume slider, which some may find easier or more intuitive than the previous dual-function volume/track skipping controls. I didn\u2019t mind the previous layout, but having them on the very top surface resulted in a lot of accidental touches. So far, that hasn\u2019t been the case with the Ultra\u2019s controls.\nThe specs\n| Price | $999 |\n| Channels | 9.1.4 |\n| Sound formats | Stereo PCM, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby Atmos (Dolby Digital Plus), Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Atmos (True HD), Multichannel PCM, Dolby Multichannel PCM, DTS Digital Surround |\n| HDMI inputs/outputs | HDMI ARC/eARC, no HDMI inputs |\n| Networking | Ethernet, Dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax |\n| Streaming protocols | Bluetooth (SBC, AAC), Apple AirPlay 2 |\n| Voice control | Sonos Voice Control, Amazon Alexa (Google Assistant/Siri compatible) |\n| Expandable | Yes, with a variety of Sonos speakers and subwoofers |\n| Subwoofer included | No |\n| Hi-res audio | Yes, up to 24-bit/48kHz |\n| Multiroom compatible | Yes |\n| Remote control | No |\nThe Arc Ultra gains Bluetooth connectivity, something the Arc lacked. When friends drop by, it\u2019s a handy feature that gives them the ability to stream to the speaker without needing your Wi-Fi password or the Sonos app. Better yet, turning on Bluetooth and pairing a phone doesn\u2019t interrupt Wi-Fi features like using the Sonos app or streaming via AirPlay \u2014 the two can coexist. Just keep in mind that Bluetooth streaming won\u2019t sound quite as good as streaming via the app.\nUnfortunately, the placement of the Bluetooth button is awkward. Unlike the same buttons on the Era 100, Era 300, and Move 2, which are positioned for easy reach at the top of the speaker\u2019s rear surface, it\u2019s nestled in the same small rear cavity that houses the HDMI and power connections, as well as the Ethernet port and physical microphone switch. The Sonos-supplied HDMI cable is thinner and more flexible than most, which may help with the crowding, but if your setup requires a third-party cable, things could get tight. It\u2019s a good thing you only need to press it when pairing a new device \u2014 navigating that space blind is tricky.\nIf you wall mount the Ultra (which you can do with an original Arc wall mount if you\u2019re upgrading), it\u2019s easier to get to those controls \u2014 the cavity has a bottom opening designed for doing so.\nIt would be great if Sonos added at least one HDMI input to its flagship soundbar, but the company is clearly opposed to doing so. To be fair, there are only two reasons for wanting an HDMI input: Your TV\u2019s remaining three HDMI inputs aren\u2019t enough to cope with your collection of connected devices, and/or you prefer to send a signal directly to your soundbar because your TV is older and can\u2019t passthrough formats like Dolby Atmos. If you don\u2019t fall into these categories, move along \u2014 nothing to see here.\nIn the box, you\u2019ll find the soundbar, a power cable, and an HDMI cable \u2014 essentially everything you need to get going. What you won\u2019t find is the optical-to-HDMI adapter that used to ship with the Ultra. , but it reckons (rightly I suspect) that most folks won\u2019t need one. Besides, if you use an optical connection, you\u2019ll miss out on Dolby Atmos.\nDespite the recent headaches with the Sonos app, I set up the Ultra just as quickly and painlessly as any other recent Sonos product. The app recognized the speaker almost as soon as I plugged it in.\nWithin a few minutes, it added it to my Wi-Fi, performed the first software update, and gave me a brief tour of its features. It then encouraged me to perform Sonos\u2019 TruePlay room tuning and gave me the option of enabling one or both optional voice assistants (Sonos Voice Control and Amazon Alexa).\nGoogle fans take note: Unlike the Sonos Arc, the Ultra doesn\u2019t offer Google Assistant for direct voice control, however, it\u2019s still controllable from Sonos\u2019 older Google Assistant-compatible products. You can also control it via Apple\u2019s Siri.\nSonos app struggles\nIt\u2019s been seven months since the new app design rolled out. Glitches aside (oh, so many glitches), my biggest criticism is that I still have trouble navigating its interface.\nThe app used to have separate tabs that let you jump between what you were listening to, what you were looking for, and a view of the Sonos speakers in your home. At first, I didn\u2019t mind their absence, but the more I use it, the more I miss them.\nNow, these formerly separate functions slide over each other, layering one view over another. Previously, even if you\u2019d never used the Sonos app, you could intuit your way through it. The new design has a steeper learning curve that rewards memorization, not intuition. I still struggle with it, as does my family.\nI bring this up for three reasons. First, Sonos has always made good wireless speakers. But it was the software that made them great. It made the potentially daunting task of managing and controlling multiple speakers and music sources easy. This new app design is a step backward, and it makes Sonos products a little harder to recommend as a result.\nSecond, the Arc Ultra doesn\u2019t come with a remote control. The Sonos app is the remote.\nExcept for power, volume, and muting, which can be controlled via your TV\u2019s remote, all other settings must be done with the app. The app is also the only way to confirm the sound format the Ultra is playing. You may think you\u2019re listening to Dolby Atmos content, but unless you see the Atmos logo in the Sonos app, there\u2019s no other confirmation.\nFinally, if you want to get the best sound quality from the Ultra when streaming music, you must use the Sonos app. The speaker supports Bluetooth and Apple AirPlay, and while both are convenient, both are lossy connections. You can also play directly from Spotify and Tidal apps, but again, these aren\u2019t high-quality streams. For lossless audio, hi-res, or Dolby Atmos Music, you must add your subscription service to the Sonos app.\nOK, I\u2019m done picking on the app. Besides, if you\u2019re already a Sonos owner, I\u2019m preaching to the choir.\nNow for the real reason you\u2019re here: the sound.\nAll about that bass (and treble)\nUnder the grille is a totally new driver arrangement. The Arc\u2019s 5.1.2-channel, three-tweeter/eight-woofer/11-amp configuration has been replaced with a seven-tweeter/six-mid-woofer/13-amp combo, plus the star of the show, Sonos\u2019 new Sound Motion dual-membrane, quad-motor, bi-amped woofer.\nIt\u2019s a remarkable bit of tech. Even though the Ultra is shorter and shallower than the Arc, and has more drivers taking up its interior room, it produces far more low-end. Place your hand in front of the speaker grille (just to the left of the volume controls) and you can feel the air being pushed out by that driver, even at moderate volume levels.\nIt\u2019s not just louder or more powerful \u2014 it\u2019s more articulate, too. With the Sound Motion driver taking the lead on lows, the mid-woofers focus their energy on the midrange, something the Arc\u2019s woofers were never free to do. This balance creates an audible improvement in precision and clarity.\nWith this level of bass on tap, the Arc Ultra becomes a true all-in-one soundbar, joining the ranks of the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus and Sony\u2019s Bravia Home Theater Bar 8. You can still significantly enhance bass performance by adding a subwoofer (or two), but it\u2019s not mandatory. In fact, I\u2019m sure a lot of folks \u2014 especially those with smaller rooms or condo dwellers \u2014 will question whether they need a sub at all.\nI\u2019ll admit, I said something similar in my review of the original Arc, when it debuted in 2020. At the time, I think it was a fair assessment \u2014 few soundbars back then could improve on the Arc\u2019s bass without the help of a subwoofer. In the four years since, however, soundbar bass has improved a lot \u2014 and the Ultra means that Sonos has kept pace.\nThe Ultra\u2019s increased number of tweeters produces a noticeable difference in clarity, especially for dialogue. The all-important center channel is cohesive and voices are more intelligible, even without experimenting with the Ultra\u2019s new three-level Speech Enhancement settings.\nBefore my Ultra review unit arrived, my wife and I watched Netflix\u2019s Kaos\u2014 a quirky, Jeff Goldblum-led reimagining of Greek gods in modern times \u2014 using the Sonos Arc. But I had a hard time understanding many of Dionysus\u2019 lines. As is often the case, a combination of accent and audio quality had me reaching for my Apple TV remote to do the \u201cwhat did he say?\u201d trick where it repeats the last few lines with subtitles turned on.\nGoing back to the same problematic lines with the Arc Ultra was like pulling away layers of gauze \u2014 suddenly there was clarity.\nTurning on Speech Enhancement will likely help those who need greater separation of voices from background sounds, but you may not like what it does to the rest of the soundtrack, especially at its highest level. This is where Sonos could benefit from a physical remote. It would be handy to quickly switch Speech Enhancement on or off (or change the level) without reaching for my phone.\nMultichannel and Dolby Atmos are both improved on the Arc Ultra. The new driver arrangement provides a more defined sense of width, depth, and height, plus better precision for individual sound effects. But once again, the extra bass from the Sound Motion driver caught my attention.\nRunning through my usual test clips, I thoroughly enjoyed the additional impact \u2014 literally. In the iconic first set piece from No Time To Die, where James Bond sits calmly inside his vintage Aston Martin as the car is slowly turned into Swiss cheese by a hail of bullets, you can feel each shot viscerally.\nThere\u2019s a similarly thrilling vibe to the roar of engines in Mad Max: Fury Road and Ford v Ferrari.\nThere\u2019s no question that the Ultra can process 9.1.4-channel audio \u2014 I ran it through a series of test tones to verify \u2014 but you should probably temper your expectations on this front. As with any single-speaker setup, volume is your friend. The louder the Ultra gets, the more vibrant and immersive the experience.\nThe Ultra, like the Arc before it, does a decent job of height channel reproduction, but it\u2019s still not as accomplished at recreating a sense of width and depth as the Bose Ultra Smart Soundbar (previously known as the Bose Smart Soundbar 900) or the Sony Bravia Home Theater Bar 8.\nOn its own, it doesn\u2019t replace a discrete speaker home theater system or even a multispeaker soundbar package like the . For that kind of performance, you\u2019ll need a set of Sonos Era 300 as rear speakers and a Sonos Sub.\nAdding these to the mix creates that missing sense of width and depth, improves height effects, and delivers powerful levels of bass. It\u2019s a superb setup, but it\u2019s far from a budget-friendly investment at $2,696.\nMy one critique of the Ultra\u2019s sound is that it tends to exhibit some harshness and sibilance in the higher frequencies. It\u2019s most noticeable when playing Atmos content \u2014 both for movies and music. My unscientific belief is that using tweeters for both the up-firing and side-firing drivers (instead of the Arc\u2019s full-range/tweeter combo) means that some sounds that need more midrange aren\u2019t getting it.\nMy test case for this is the superb Atmos mix of The Doors\u2019 Riders on the Storm. Some of Jim Morrison\u2019s lyrics are echoed ethereally by the height channels. It\u2019s supposed to sound like the eerie whispers of disembodied voices, but instead, they sound shrill \u2026 like cartoon ghosts trying to scare you.\nYou can mitigate this a little using the EQ settings (moving the treble slider into the negative values), but since this also affects the rest of the mix, it\u2019s an imperfect solution.\nThis is partially because Atmos Music is a hit-and-miss format. There\u2019s an Atmos version of Diana Ross\u2019 I\u2019m Coming Out that sounds crazy good on the Ultra. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say it was mixed for the Arc Ultra: no trace of sibilance, the snare and cymbal hits are tight, and the horns (plus Ross\u2019 distinctive voice) are very clear. It\u2019s not surprising that Sonos recommended it as a sample track for Arc Ultra reviewers.\nI also didn\u2019t detect any harshness when the Ultra rendered stereo. Where the Arc\u2019s tuning favored vibrant highs and deep lows \u2014 somewhat undermining its musicality \u2014 the Arc Ultra has more nuance and detail through the mids and creates a natural, relaxed sound. It\u2019s a balancing act you\u2019ll appreciate if you use the Ultra for more than just TV audio.\nOne quick note on using the Sonos Ace headphones with the Arc Ultra via TV Audio Swap. Just like with the Arc, the Ace can receive a fully rendered Dolby Atmos mix from the Ultra, along with head tracking to help with the realism of hearing speakers in a room. However, the Ultra doesn\u2019t mimic its own 9.1.4 processing for the Ace\u2019s mix. Instead, it gets the same 7.1.4 mix as the Arc delivered. That\u2019s hardly a problem. It sounds just fine and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to distinguish another two channels in the mix.\nMoreover, we\u2019ll probably hear a bigger improvement when Sonos releases its TrueCinema feature for the Ace, which attempts to mimic your room\u2019s real-world acoustics. When it launched the Ace, Sonos said TrueCinema was coming later this year (2024). But that was before the company had to reassign virtually all of its engineering talent to the epic task of fixing the broken Sonos app.\nMy only gripe is that Sonos doesn\u2019t offer much flexibility when using the Ace and Arc Ultra. \u201cSwap\u201d is exactly what happens \u2014 you trade soundbar audio for headphones audio. That\u2019s not helpful when you want to watch in a group setting, but one person needs headphones. And, for now, while you can set up more than one Sonos Ace to do TV Audio Swap with the Ultra, only one set of headphones at a time can receive the signal.\nThe future is Ultra\nNow that it has been replaced by the slightly more expensive Arc Ultra, the Sonos Arc will only remain available while supplies last. If you can score a big discount \u2014 say 30% or more \u2014 it\u2019s still a great soundbar. But the Arc Ultra is better in almost every way that counts.\nWith new Bluetooth streaming, clearer dialogue, more precision and detail, and that extra punch of low-end bass, it\u2019s a better speaker for TV audio and music.\nThe lack of an HDMI input (especially now that Sonos is asking $999) or a physical remote are small, but notable drawbacks. The real cause for hesitation, especially if you\u2019ve never owned a Sonos product, is the company\u2019s ongoing app woes. You may want to wait for things to improve before taking the plunge. But if you\u2019re already all-in on Sonos, the Arc Ultra makes a great addition to your TV setup, whether it\u2019s your first Sonos soundbar or an upgrade."

      "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is huge news right now, thanks to chatbots like ChatGPT \u2014 but did you know you can already access an AI on your Android phone? Google Assistant is Google\u2019s AI-powered voice assistant, and it\u2019s available on Android, iOS, and a large number of smart devices (like Google\u2019s Nest speakers). While not as capable as ChatGPT (yet), Google Assistant can handle an impressive number of tasks \u2014 including pausing and resuming songs and videos, making tasks and reminders, and in some cases, even taking and screening phone calls for you.\nThat may seem like a lot, but Google Assistant is relatively simple to use. If you\u2019ve never used a voice assistant before, we\u2019ve got this guide to help you get to grips with it and take your first steps.\nWhat is Google Assistant?\nFirst, though, you need to know what exactly Google Assistant is. Google Assistant has a long and rich history, but its roots lie in Google\u2019s search feature. The first glimmers of what would eventually become Google Assistant launched as Google Voice Search. A far cry from what we can do now, this feature was extremely basic and only allowed for the most simple of voice commands, like voice searches.\nThe really big change came with the introduction of Google Now in Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Code-named \u201cMajel\u201d after Majel Barrett, wife of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and voice of the computer in many Star Trek series, Google Now included Google Voice Search, but now with the important change of having answers read aloud. It also introduced a notification system that would inform you of upcoming appointments or traffic, and later updates would add Gmail integration as well, expanding on its capabilities.\nGoogle Now persisted for years, before eventually being absorbed into Google Assistant when it launched on the first Google Pixel. Google Assistant quickly grew to every Android phone running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and newer, and from there, Google hasn\u2019t looked back; Google Assistant has only grown in features and usefulness.\nA decade after Google Now\u2019s initial launch, some elements of Google\u2019s dream have been realized. While it\u2019s still a far cry from Star Trek\u2018s omniscient computer, Google Assistant reaches far into our lives, helping to control our vacuums, TVs, music, and lots more.\nEverything Google Assistant can do\nCreating a complete list of Google Assistant\u2019s abilities and commands would be an enormous endeavor, and well beyond the aims of this particular article. However, we can summarize its general abilities, so you can have a good idea of what you can expect your AI pal to do for you.\nGeneral knowledge inquiries\nGoogle Assistant is able to give you general information on a subject. As a general rule of thumb, if you can Google it and get an answer directly from the search page, then the Assistant can read it to you. You can ask it about the weather, when the sun sets, how tall a celebrity is, to do basic math, define words, and much more. If it\u2019s not sure about a question, it will usually read you a few sentences from a website it thinks might know the answer and send a link to your device to read more.\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather like in [say location]?\u201d\n- \u201cWhen is [say the name of the team] next game?\u201d\n- \u201cHow old is [name]?\u201d\n- \u201cSynonyms for [say the word].\u201d\nHelp you with your day and account\nGoogle Assistant can function as a more personal assistant as well, as long as you\u2019ve set it up to do so. Most of the more personal questions will require you\u2019ve set up Voice Match, so Google can be sure it\u2019s not telling anyone else about your personal business.\nOnce you\u2019ve set it up, though, you can ask Google Assistant questions about your personal commute to work, when upcoming events are, and even control your Google privacy settings or delete any stored data.\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s my commute like?\u201d\n- \u201cWhere\u2019s my hotel?\u201d\n- \u201cDelete everything I said today.\u201d (Also works for this week, month, or year)\n- \u201cHow far away is [say the name of the location]?\u201d\nControl streaming and other devices\nWith availability on a wide range of devices, including phones, tablets, and smart speakers, there\u2019s a lot Google Assistant can do on other devices. You can ask it to play a specific program on your TV, toggle phone settings, and even ring your phone.\n- \u201cPlay some music.\u201d\n- \u201cTurn [on/off] [Flashlight, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth].\u201d\n- \u201cPlay The Umbrella Academy on TV.\u201d\n- \u201cFind my phone.\u201d\nPixel-specific abilities\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel smartphones are more intimately tied to Google Assistant than other phones, so they have a number of specific features. These don\u2019t generally take the form of commands but are usually AI-powered features. Examples include having the Assistant answer phone calls for you or even holding your place in a call queue.\nSome of these features can be expected to come to other Android phones down the line, but Pixels will generally get new features first, making them the smartphone range of choice for Assistant addicts.\nAnd a whole lot more\nWe\u2019ve barely scratched the surface here. We haven\u2019t mentioned how the Assistant can send text messages, interact with specific apps, and translate languages. We have a more comprehensive list if you want to do a deeper dive, and we recommend taking at least a skim so you have a good idea of everything your Google Assistant can help with.\nWhat devices have Google Assistant?\nOne of the best parts of Google Assistant is that it\u2019s built into a number of different devices, so you can easily fill your house with smart devices that all tie back to the same overarching system.\nThe first place you\u2019ll find Google Assistant is on smartphones and tablets. Google Assistant is built into almost every Android device, with the exception of some very old smartphones and tablets, and those which use Android without Google\u2019s services, like Huawei\u2019s devices and Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets. Aside from those, though, you\u2019ll find most Android phones and tablets have access to Google Assistant, including top-tier devices like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Google Pixel 7 Pro, and OnePlus 11, as well as more budget offerings like the Nokia G60 5G.\nWear OS-powered smartwatches also bring Google Assistant along for the ride, and as you might expect, that number includes the Pixel Watch. However, it also includes the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, which uses a modified Wear OS as its base software, meaning Google Assistant is still present.\nWhat about Apple phones, like the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14? While Apple\u2019s iPhones ship with the Siri assistant by default, you can add Google Assistant to your iPhone by downloading the Google Assistant app from the App Store. You\u2019ll need to jump through hoops to get it to respond to your voice though. Start by going into the Shortcuts app, and adding a shortcut to activate Google Assistant through Siri. To do this, open Shortcuts, then select the Add (plus button) > Add action, then select Assistant from the list. Then choose Hey Google and add the Hey Google shortcut. Then you\u2019ll be able to say \u201cHey Siri, hey Google\u201d to bring up Google Assistant through Siri.\nGoogle Assistant also isn\u2019t limited to just smartphones and tablets. It\u2019s unsurprising that you can access Google Assistant on the Google Nest smart speakers and Chromecast, but did you know smart speakers from JBL, Sonos, Bose, and others also have Google Assistant support? Not only that, but you can also find Google Assistant support on smart locks, robot vacuums, smart plugs, and even lightbulbs. If there\u2019s a smart version of something, then you can be sure you can find a version with Google Assistant support.\nWhere to find Google Assistant settings\nUsing Google Assistant is a relatively simple process, but there\u2019s a lot going on under the surface. Google Assistant has a lot of settings to tweak and change and also has many additional options that can make your time with Google Assistant even more productive. You\u2019ll find Google Assistant\u2019s settings in the Home app.\nStep 1: Open the Home app.\nStep 2: Select your face in the top-right, then choose Assistant settings.\nThere are a lot of different settings here, and most are fairly self-explanatory. However, there are some standout options worth checking out. The You section allows your Assistant to be a bit more personal. For instance, you can set up contacts as specific family members, so you can ask the Assistant to \u201ccall Dad\u201d or \u201ccall Mom\u201d. You can also pick your default traveling method under You > Transport, whether it be car, bike, or walking.\nIf you\u2019re looking to automate more of your life, then Assistant Routines may be for you. These heavily customizable actions can trigger a number of actions from a single prompt, so they\u2019re perfect for automating parts of your everyday routine. You could create a routine to start a podcast playlist when you start the morning drive to work, or you could set the living room lamps to come on at a specific time of day, or even start a bedtime routine when you tell your Assistant \u201cgood night\u201d. You can find these under Assistant settings > Routines.\nThese are just two of the advanced settings you set for your Assistant, but there are plenty more \u2014 including specifying dietary requirements, setting up your Face Match for personal results on camera-equipped smart devices, the Family Bell feature to alert your family at specific times, and lots more. There\u2019s so much we could dedicate an entire article just to the settings menu, so take your time and explore to see what\u2019s on offer.\nHow to change Google Assistant\u2019s voice\nYou\u2019re going to hear the Assistant\u2019s voice a lot, so it\u2019s important it\u2019s a voice you\u2019re happy to hear. If you\u2019re not, you can change it easily in the settings app.\nStep 1: Open the Home app.\nStep 2: Select your face in the top-right, then choose Assistant settings.\nStep 3: Scroll down and select Assistant voice & sounds.\nStep 4: The different options available to you are represented by colored circles. Scroll through them and see which one you prefer.\nHow to turn off Google Assistant\nAI assistants aren\u2019t for everyone, and you may not want the extra features offered by Google Assistant. If that\u2019s the case, you can easily turn it off with the following steps:\nStep 1: Open the Home app on your phone.\nStep 2: Open Assistant settings by selecting your face in the top-right of the Home app.\nStep 3: Scroll down and select General.\nStep 4: Untick the Google Assistant option.\nThis will turn off Google Assistant on your device entirely, so you\u2019ll no longer get \u201cHey Google\u201d triggers, but you also won\u2019t get Assistant-powered features like Snapshot as well. If that\u2019s a bit too extreme for you, you can just turn off the \u201cHey Google\u201d listening function by heading back to the Assistant settings screen, and then selecting Hey Google & Voice Match and unticking Hey Google.\nYou can also turn off Google Assistant on your Google Nest devices too, though this essentially just turns the device into a speaker, so we don\u2019t recommend using it all the time. However, if you want to make sure it\u2019s not listening to everything you\u2019re saying, you can toggle the hardware mute switch on each Nest device to make sure it\u2019s temporarily deafened.\nWhich one is better \u2014 Siri or Google Assistant?\nSiri and Google Assistant are two of the more prominent smartphone-based AI assistants, so it\u2019s natural they\u2019re often compared. Which is better? That\u2019s a tricky question \u2014 and one that needs in-depth and focused analysis.\nIn brief, though, both share a lot of similar features. Both respond to their hot words quickly and efficiently and can pull up relevant data with similar levels of accuracy. You can also use either to control compatible devices \u2014 of which there are plenty \u2014 as well as control certain elements of your smartphone. That said, the smartphone controls are a little more limited on Google Assistant and require some additional setup on most devices, so your experience of this on an iPhone is likely to be smoother. Google Assistant does have an advantage in other Assistant-powered areas, though, including features like call screening and queue waiting. These are tricks Siri can\u2019t replicate, and it does give the Assistant some extra gimmick points.\nOn the whole, it\u2019s best to use whichever assistant is built into your smartphone \u2014 so Siri for iPhones, and Google Assistant for Android phones. While there are definitely differences between the capabilities of the two, they\u2019re relatively minor in the greater scope of your device, and both are likely to work very well for you.\nThere is one area to consider if you\u2019re a brand-hopper. While Google Assistant works on iPhones (with some workarounds), Siri does not work on Android. So Google Assistant can move with you across phone brands, while Siri cannot. That\u2019s not a problem if you\u2019re a proud and eternal iPhone-lover \u2014 but if you\u2019re considering swapping to an Android phone to see what all the fuss is about, you\u2019ll have to start again with Google Assistant and won\u2019t be able to bring your Siri with you."

      "text": "A TV's built-in speakers often leave a lot to be desired when it comes to sound quality, and a full-on multi-speaker system will cost you a pretty penny. Thankfully, today's soundbars are more powerful and feature-packed than ever! From Dolby Atmos virtualization to voice assistant compatibility, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a soundbar without a list of cool capabilities (other than making your TV sound better). There is an abundance of soundbar models to choose from on the market today, many made by popular television brands and others made by companies with a rich history of audio excellence.\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new soundbar or simply want to catch up on all things audio, we\u2019ve put together this list of the best soundbars you can run out and buy (or order online) right now.\nBest soundbar overall\nSamsung HW-Q990D Dolby Atmos Soundbar\n- Excellent sound quality and wide soundstage\n- HDMI 2.1 connectivity\n- Supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X\n- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities\n- Expensive\n- Might be overkill for some folks\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 48.5 x 2.8 x 5.4 inches; 17 pounds |\n| Power | N/A |\n| Connectivity | 1 x HDMI eARC, 2 x HDMI 2.1, digital optical, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD MA, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | Alexa, Google Assistant (region-specific) |\nThe Samsung HW-Q990D is a robust soundbar system that comes with two rear speakers and a wireless subwoofer, delivering a complete surround sound experience without the hassle of investing in an AV receiver or running a bunch of speaker wires. Last year, we proudly featured the Samsung HW-Q990C as our top soundbar, and the HW-990D only made life sweeter by introducing HDMI 2.1 connectivity and 4K/120Hz capabilities. But of course, the most pressing question is, \u201cHow does it sound?\u201d Utterly fantastic, actually.\nBilled as an 11.1.4 setup, the HW-Q990D has two up-firing drivers built into the soundbar and two built into the rear speakers. This allows the system to shoot sound up toward the ceiling and back down, creating the 3D immersion that Dolby Atmos and DTS:X are known for. And thanks to Samsung\u2019s SpaceFit Sound Pro technology, the HW-Q990D will automatically adjust system output based on your listening environment, ensuring you get the best audio for rooms both big and small.\nThe HW-Q990D boasts an expansive soundstage with a solid balance of highs, mids, and lows and features numerous audio customizations, as well as a graphic EQ (Standard preset only). You\u2019ll also get full Dolby and DTS support, along with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities, the latter of which opens the doors to services like AirPlay, Spotify Connect, and Chromecast.\nYes, it\u2019s a bit on the pricey side, but if you\u2019re in the market for the absolute best soundbar you can connect to your TV, you may as well go all in on surround sound emulation, too!\nBest Dolby Atmos sound from a single speaker\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus\n- Fantastic 3D sound\n- Lots of connections\n- Built-in room tuning\n- Up to 4 wireless subs/1 wired sub\n- AirPlay/Chromecast/Tidal Connect\n- Alexa built-in\n- Dolby Atmos/DTS:X\n- Sony 360/MPEG-H\n- Still expensive\n- Only HDMI 2.0a\n- Relies heavily on mobile app\n- Weird Alexa integration\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 41.3 x 3 x 5.1 inches; 14.1 pounds |\n| Power | Up to 400 watts |\n| Connectivity | 1 x HDMI eARC, 2 x HDMI inputs, digital optical, RCA, LFE output, Ethernet |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD MA, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | Alexa, Google Assistant |\nIf you want to get the most immersive and powerful sound possible from a soundbar \u2014 with no subwoofers or extra surround speakers \u2014 the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus is without equal. Its secret sauce is the Ambeo digital signal processing that Sennheiser pioneered with its first soundbar, the recently renamed Ambeo Soundbar Max.\nYou can think of Ambeo as a turbo-charger for immersive, 3D audio. Using the Soundbar Plus' nine drivers and amps, it projects sound around even large rooms in such a way that you become convinced there must be speakers hiding behind your furniture or in your ceiling. It truly brings Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and even two-channel stereo to life in a way that is nothing short of mesmerizing. To get even close to this effect, most soundbars need to add additional surround speakers, and even then, they don't always succeed.\nWith two HDMI 2.0a inputs (plus optical and analog ports) and an HDMI 2.1 ARC/eARC input/output, there's no need to give up ports on your TV. And with the option to use Sennheiser's wireless Ambeo subs (up to four) or your own wired subwoofer, you're not locked in to a specific accessory for low-end power. Its support for AirPlay, Chromecast, and Bluetooth means you're free to stream music to the bar from any device you own. And if you want to use it as a smart speaker, Amazon Alexa is built-in and can be turned on at any time.\nAt $1,500, it's one of the more expensive soundbars. And despite being able to add it to Google Home or Amazon Alexa, it's not a great choice for multiroom sound. But when you take into account its remarkable performance as an Atmos speaker, it's worth every penny.\nHonorable mentions: If you're looking specifically for a Sennheiser, a more powerful (but considerably larger and more expensive) option is the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Max. Alternately, we can recommend the Sony HT-A7000, another one of Sony's capable soundbars that, for the same price range as the Ambeo, features Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, sounds great for music as well as movies and TV (with clear dialogue), and support for Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Alexa.\nBest no-holds-barred, money-is-no-object soundbar\nNakamichi Dragon 11.4.6 Surround Sound System\n- Supremely clean highs\n- Crystal-clear dialogue\n- Massively powerful\n- Seamless surround effects/object placement\n- Ridiculously fun\n- Lack of separate LFE and bass control\n- OSD could use better integration\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 58 x 4.4 x 7.7 inches; 32.1 pounds |\n| Power | Up to 5,000 watts |\n| Connectivity | 1 x HDMI eARC, 3 x HDMI 2.1 inputs, digital optical, 3.5mm aux, Bluetooth |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD MA, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | N/A |\nCall it the dragon's egg at the end of this best soundbars list, call it the beast that'll burn a hole right through your wallet, call it what you want but whatever you do, don't call the Nakamichi Dragon surround sound system for the faint of heart. We'll try our best to describe it here, but it's worth taking a few minutes for Caleb's Denison's video review, or watch him put it head to head with a Sonos Arc system to get the bigger picture about this $3,900 11.4.6 surround sound system.\nFirst, though, the basics: the Nakamichi Dragon consists of a massive 58-inch soundbar unit that weighs around 40 pounds and features 14 speakers and seven digital amplifiers. There are two 9-pound wireless surround sound speakers each with five drivers (side, rear, and up-firing), and two wireless subwoofers, each with two 8-inch drivers in them. Yeah, the total system output is 3,000 watts peaking at 125 decibels. Translation: loud.\nThe Nakamichi Dragon excels in volume, clarity, precision, soundstage, and just about every other audio-related term used to say \"it sounds incredible\" for both music and movies. But where it shines is in its abilities as a surround system, with support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. Through auditioning several surround sound examples, Denison noted the Dragon's ability to immerse him in cavernous reverbs and pinpoint-accurate object placement around the room \u2014 sounds even seem to originate from places in the room where there are no speakers. Dialogue is clear and easy to understand (depending on the sound mix, of course), and explosive rumble comes with ease form the Dragon's woofers.\nSetup and calibration, while not for newbies, is pretty straightforward and id guided by a well-designed on-screen display that lets you select room size, EQing for games, movies, and more, as well as advanced calibration tools to get the system perfectly tuned for your uses.\nCould you assemble a comparable system for less money? Of course you could. The $2,600 Sonos system (Arc soundbar, two Era 300s, one Sonos Sub), Denison compares the Dragon to in his video is roughly the same price (if you add a second Sub like the Dragon has, it's $3,400), and there are obviously full Atmos receiver/speaker setups you could get into for less. But if you've got the money and are a little more serious about your home theater audio, few can compete with the impact and clarity of the Dragon at this price.\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbar for less than $1,000\nVizio Elevate Soundbar\n- Simple setup, clear chart showing connections\n- Wonderfully unique design\n- Deep control over sound output levels\n- Exceptionally clear dialogue\n- Effects dependent on room\n- Costly\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 48 x 2.64 x 6.5 inches; 12.39 pounds |\n| Power | N/A |\n| Connectivity | 1 x HDMI eARC, 2 x HDMI inputs, digital optical, 3.5mm AUX, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD MA, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | N/A |\nThe Vizio Elevate is the company's flagship and it deserves serious consideration by anyone who wants an elegantly designed and powerful sound system for their TV.\nThe Elevate's signature feature is its rotating speaker modules. They sit at the ends of the soundbar and rotate from front-firing to up-firing whenever Dolby Atmos or DTS:X content is being played. When combined with the up-firing drivers embedded in the surround speakers, you get four height channels, for overhead sound effects that rival those of more premium units. Better yet, all of those 5.1.4 channels are individually controllable, so you can easily tune the speakers to your space.\nThe included wireless subwoofer has a generous eight-inch driver and can reach as low as 30Hz, and has enough power to rattle your windows, even if it can't quite compare to the dedicated powered subs you'll find on more expensive component systems.\nWith two HDMI inputs and an HDMI ARC/eARC output, there's no problem with being able to attach external media sources, and Bluetooth is on tap for streaming music from your phone. The only thing missing is Wi-Fi, so there's no support for high-quality audio streaming from music services, no compatibility with AirPlay, Chromecast, or Amazon Alexa, and no multi-room audio.\nStill, for the price, it's very hard to beat the Elevate for pure TV and movie immersion. The only thing that comes close is Vizio's own M-Series Elevate, which is $200 cheaper and lacks the flagship Elevate's rear up-firing drivers.\nBest single-speaker soundbar under $500\nKlipsch Flexus Core 200\n- Fabulous sound\n- Striking levels of bass\n- Easy setup\n- Wired subwoofer output\n- Backlit remote\n- No Wi-Fi\n- Slightly tame height channels\n- Can't save settings per input\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 43.9 x 3 x 4.9 inches; 18.7 pounds |\n| Power | 185 watts |\n| Connectivity | HDMI eARC, digital optical, LFE output, USB |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | N/A |\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great Dolby Atmos soundbar that won\u2019t cost you more than $1,000, your sights should be set on the Klipsch Flexus Core 200. Not only is this a phenomenal soundbar on its own but when you add a Flexus Sub 100 and Flexus Surr 100 rear speakers to your setup, you\u2019ll have a complete Flexus surround system. Of course, these are optional add-ons.\nWhat we\u2019d really like to rave about is how much power the Flexus Core 200 packs. Rated at 185 watts, we were blown away by how large of the soundbar is for the price. Even without a subwoofer, the Flexus Core 200 delivers a ridiculous amount of bass, on top of excellent dialogue clarity and decent height-channel virtualization. No, it doesn\u2019t touch the output of a true Atmos system, but it\u2019s far more than just a traditional stereo sound enhancer.\nThe Klipsch Connect app is another great addition to the Flexus Core 200 package. Intuitive from one screen to the next, you\u2019ll be able to do everything from EQ customization to volume controls and surround speaker configuration. And while the Flexus Core 200 is equipped with an HDMI eARC port and digital optical, there\u2019s no way to connect the Flexus to the internet. This just means that you\u2019ll need to do all your wireless music streaming via Bluetooth.\nBest budget soundbar\nSonos Ray\n- Compact for versatile placement\n- Impressive sound for its size\n- Expandable to a full 5.1 system\n- Easy setup and control\n- Pricey for a small soundbar\n- Lacks a bit of midrange detail\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 22 x 2.8 x 3.7 inches; 4.3 pounds |\n| Power | N/A |\n| Connectivity | Digital optical, Ethernet |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Digital, DTS |\n| Voice assistant | Alexa, Google Assistant |\nSo you've wanted to get into Sonos for your TV room, but your room's a bit too small for the big sound and bigger price of its flagship Sonos Arc (on our list above) or even the middle-tier ). In 2022 Sonos finally addressed this need and launched the Sonos Ray, and while it's still more pricey than some of the choices on our list, this is Sonos we're talking about, and should you choose, the Ray can either add to your existing multi-room Sonos system or be the beginning of one.\nSimilar in size and look to the Beam, the Ray comes in black and white finishes and looks sharp anywhere, and it can also be wall-mounted with a bracket you can get from Sonos.\nSetup is signature Sonos simple, and once it is it's easy to control with the excellent Sonos app, which you can use to control volume, EQing, and grouping with other Sonos speakers. There are also touch controls on the top of the soundbar, too.\nWhile the Sonos Ray isn't a Dolby Atmos soundbar like its Beam (2nd gen) and Arc siblings, optical connectivity to your TV allows for Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Digital Surround, if and when you want to expand your system with, for example, a Sonos Sub Mini and a pair of Sonos Era 100s or Sonos Ones as rear surrounds.\nAnd it kind of goes without saying that it sounds good, too, with our reviewer Simon Cohen praising its ability to deliver big low-end and mids, as well as clear highs, perfect for sound effects in movies such as whizzing bullets, screeching tires, and barking dogs. Music, Cohen says, sounds equally good, and, as per all Sonos speakers, you get access to all your streaming services like Tidal, Spotify, Apple Music, and more.\nBest expandable Dolby Atmos soundbar\nSonos Arc Ultra\n- Big, powerful bass\n- Clear and intelligible dialogue\n- Immersive Dolby Atmos\n- Great for music and movies\n- Lots of expansion options\n- Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay\n- No HDMI input\n- No remote\n- Highs can be slightly harsh\n- Sonos app is still buggy\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 3.1 x 46.4 x 4.3 inches; 13 pounds |\n| Power | N/A |\n| Connectivity | 1 x HDMI eARC, Ethernet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | Alexa, Google Assistant |\nIt's been just over four years since the launch of the original Sonos Arc soundbar, and it's been on this list of best soundbars ever since, for its excellent sound, sleek design, and ease of use. Luckily, its successor, the Sonos Arc Ultra, has arrived to take the reins, and although it's nearly identical to the Arc, it holds its status as one of the best, and with a few welcome improvements.\nLooks-wise, there very little difference between the Arc and the Ultra \u2014 it's 2 inches wider than the Arc, but a bit shorter a little shallower. It also has a new housing that wraps around the back of the speaker and runs along most of its length at the back. It's much more pronounced than the Arc, and it also now houses the Ultra's touch controls, including a volume slider that brings it up to speed with other new generation Sonos speakers like the Era 100, Era 300, and the Move 2.\nEven with Sonos' app rollout woes last year, setting up the Arc Ultra is still incredibly easy with the app, and the speaker still seamlessly incorporates itself into your larger network of whole-home Sonos sound. This updated model also adds Bluetooth support, for decreased reliance on the app when playing music.\nAs with the Arc, the Arc Ultra uses up-firing speaker drivers to re-create Dolby Atmos sound, adding a solid sense of 3D space to action films, sports, and more. But make no mistake, there have been some improvements. The Arc\u2019s 5.1.2-channel array has been replaced with seven-tweeters, six-mid-woofers, 15 class-D amplifiers, and Sonos\u2019 new Sound Motion dual-membrane, quad-motor, bi-amped woofer, making it louder, more powerful, and more articulate.\nOn its own the Ultra is impressive, but you can easily expand its home theater capabilities by adding other Sonos speakers as surround satellites, such as a pair of Era 100s, Era 300s, or connecting to a pair of Sonos' Sonos Ace headphones that work with the Arc (and Beam (Gen 2), Beam (Gen 1), and Ray soundbars) to pipe Dolby Atmos spatial audio sound from the Arc to them.\nPlus, you can also grow the system later by adding a sub, like the magnificent \u2014 if very expensive \u2014 and the new, smaller Sub Mini. HDMI eARC connectivity makes the Ultra a breeze to add to your TV and set up.\nThe Sonos Arc is also a smart speaker, with two choices of voice assistant: the bare-bones but super useful Sonos Voice Control for Sonos-only functions, and Alexa, which can control Sonos products and much more, too. Google Assistant fans, sadly, cannot use it directly with the Ultra, but its functions can still be controlled through older Sonos speakers that still support it, should you have them.\nAll around, the Arc Ultra will take your TV to the next level and deliver a fantastic music-listening setup as well, and it's only $100 more than the outgoing Sonos Arc \u2014 until Sonos depletes its stock.\nHonorable mention: If the Sonos ecosystem isn't your thing, Bose's latest flagship, the , is a great alternative from a company with more years of top-tier audio excellence than most. It's the same price as the Sonos Arc, sports Dolby Atmos, has up-firing drivers for that immersive all-around effect, and features an AI-driven dialogue mode. The Bose SimpleSync feature also lets you connect to other Bose speakers and headphones you have in your house.\nThe best small soundbar\nBose Smart Soundbar\n- Easy setup\n- Excellent Atmos for its size\n- Clear and engaging dialog\n- AirPlay and Chromecast\n- Good music quality\n- No HDMI inputs\n- Smart speaker is Alexa-only\n- Limited in-app music services\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 27.3 x 2.1 x 4.5 inches; 6.9 pounds |\n| Power | N/A |\n| Connectivity | 1 x HDMI eARC, 1 x HDMI input, digital optical, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | Alexa, Google Assistant |\nWhen compared to Sonos, Bose still has a ways to go when it comes to multiroom sound and streaming music service integration, but thanks to the Bose Smart Soundbar's built-in up-firing height drivers, it's the best small speaker for movies and TV \u2014 especially if Dolby Atmos is involved.\nBass and dialog clarity are two especially bright spots for the Smart Soundbar, but it's the sheer size of the speaker's soundstage that you notice the most. It projects sound upward, outward, and to the sides so effectively, you'll swear there are additional speakers in your room. If the effect isn't powerful enough, you can add the real deal \u2014 the Smart Soundbar is compatible with two models of wireless Bose subwoofers and two models of wireless Bose surround speakers.\nLike its predecessor, the Smart Soundbar 300, and the Sonos Beam Gen 2, the 600 can act as a smart speaker, but only using Amazon's Alexa AI. Google Assistant is still compatible, but it's no longer built-in. However, you do get Chromecast in addition to AirPlay and Bluetooth, making the Smart Soundbar a better streaming choice for Android users than Sonos (AirPlay only).\nThe Smart Soundbar also has a feature that's custom-tailored to bedrooms: You can connect any compatible Bose headphones over Bluetooth for private listening. Bose's Personal Surround Sound tech lets you use a pair of the company's Ultra Open Earbuds to augment the sound. \"When the devices are paired together, the earbuds act as a substitute for discrete surround speakers. Thanks to the earbuds\u2019 fully open design, you can hear all kinds of surrounding sounds, including the soundbar\u2019s audio,\" our reviewer Simon Cohen says about the feature.\nHonorable mentions: If keeping things tight and tidy under your TV is a priority, we can suggest a few more soundbars on the smaller side, including the , a Dolby Atmos-capable soundbar thats's great if you're looking to build or expand a multiroom wireless audio system; the Sony HT-S2000, which excels at Dolby Atmos sound for around the same price; and the Polk MagniFi Mini AX, a tiny Dolby Atmos/DTS:X soundbar the deliver clear dialogue and comes with a powerful subwoofer for under $500.\nBest soundbar alternative for Apple TV fans\nApple HomePod (2nd Gen)\n- Great sound quality\n- Incredible bass performance\n- Dazzling Spatial Audio surround\n- Plug and Play wireless\n- Slick design\n- Limited connection options\n- No direct Spotify playback\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 5.6 x 6.6 inches; 5.16 pounds |\n| Power | N/A |\n| Connectivity | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth |\n| Supported formats | N/A |\n| Voice assistant | Siri |\nHomePod, the little Apple smart-speaker-that-could, made its triumphant return to store shelves early this year after the Cupertino company discontinued the original in 2021. It's an excellent-sounding speaker that has improved upon the original in a number of ways, it's packed with room-sensing tech that adapt the sound to basically anywhere you put it, and it's a top-notch smart speaker with Matter supportso it can work with and control all your home's connected smart devices, such as lights, thermostats, and more.\nSo why, you might ask, is a smart speaker included on our list of the best soundbars? Because, as our intrepid Editor-at-Large, Caleb Denison, discovered in his review, when you pair two 2nd-gen HomePods together and add a new Apple TV 4K, the combination easily competes with soundbars, including the Sonos Beam. So much so that Denison called the experience \"downright magical.\"\nAnd while there are definitely some differences between the more expensive HomePods + Apple TV 4K setup (roughly $750) and a $500 Sonos Beam (HDMI eARC is the big one missing from the HomePod), pairing a set of HomePods together offer not only excellent stereo sound separation when listening to movies (something that is harder to achieve with a soundbar), but Spatial Audio for movies and TV is amazing. \"Dialogue is crystal clear and perfectly centered, sound effects are spacious and enveloping \u2014 I definitely got the impression there were more speakers in the room,\" Denison gushed. Even the bass surprised him for a two-channel system, and if you want for a system that also does music just as well (or maybe you want to explore Dolby Atmos Music tracks, too), a set of HomePods might be worth a look.\nBest soundbar alternative for everyone\nSony Bravia Theatre Quad\n- Incredibly flexible\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Convincing Atmos surround\n- Easy placement and setup\n- Great for movies and music\n- Very expensive\n- Buggy app\n| Specification: | |\n| Size (WxHxD) | 11.4 x 12.6 x 5.1 inches; 5.3 pounds |\n| Power | 340 watts |\n| Connectivity | 1 x HDMI eARC, 2 x HDMI 2.1 inputs, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ethernet |\n| Supported formats | Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD MA, PCM |\n| Voice assistant | N/A |\nImagine a home theater system that transcends the limitations of your living space, transforming any room into an immersive cinematic sanctuary. Sony's Bravia Theatre Quad system promises to do just that. This innovative solution challenges the conventional notion of surround sound, delivering a genuinely captivating audio experience that adapts seamlessly to your environment.\nAt the heart of the Bravia Theatre Quad lies a quartet of compact wireless speakers, each engineered with four internal drivers to generate a vibrant and nuanced soundscape. However, the true genius of this system lies in its advanced spatial mapping technology. Utilizing intricate algorithms, this intelligent system analyzes your room's unique dimensions, pinpointing the precise location of walls, furniture, and even ceiling height. This detailed acoustic mapping allows the Bravia Theatre Quad to calibrate each speaker individually, optimizing sound dispersion for a genuinely immersive, three-dimensional audio experience.\nThis adaptability allows for freedom in speaker placement. Whether you prefer a sleek, minimalist aesthetic with wall-mounted speakers, a genuinely immersive overhead soundscape with ceiling-mounted units, or the flexibility of freestanding speakers positioned for optimal sound dispersion, the Theatre Quad adapts to your preferences and room layout.\nBeyond its versatility, the Theatre Quad boasts exceptional audio fidelity. Reviewers, like our own Caleb Denison, and audiophiles praise its crystal-clear dialogue reproduction, which ensures that you never miss a word, even during explosive action sequences. The system's dynamic range captures the full spectrum of sonic detail, from subtle whispers to room-shaking explosions, allowing you to experience the true emotional impact of your favorite films. The Bravia Theatre Quad's impressive Atmos virtualization technology creates a convincing illusion of overhead sound, adding breathtaking realism and immersion.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThey offer a small footprint, they\u2019re affordable and easy to set up, and they sound much better than the speakers built into most TVs.\nVirtually all modern soundbars connect to your TV via digital connection either with an optical or HDMI cable. The latter is generally preferred for TVs with HDMI ARC or eARC, as it allows for better sound and control of basic functionality with your TV remote. For Dolby Atmos, an HDMI connection is a prerequisite.\nSome of them can be, yes. See the above for information about HDMI ARC.\nYes, many come with mounting brackets in the box, but almost all have optional wall-mount solutions you can buy later.\nTechnically yes, but we usually recommend mounting them below the TV. In general, we recommend you get them as close to ear level as possible for the best sound.\nMost new soundbars do have this sort of wireless functionality. This typically allows you to stream music from your smartphone or home network directly to the soundbar. If a soundbar is also a smart speaker (e.g. Sonos Arc Ultra, Bose Smart Soundbar 600) it will be Wi-Fi equipped.\nWi-Fi is generally preferable to Bluetooth for music streaming as its higher bandwidth supports higher quality formats like lossless FLAC, ALAC, WAV, and others. See the above question for wireless functionality with your TV or receiver.\nNo, not always. Some are built without them purposefully to save space. If they contain built-in subwoofers they can still deliver surprisingly strong bass, but most rely on a wired (or wireless) subwoofer for low-frequency sound.\nYes, but in slightly different ways. Some soundbars can double as smart speakers. The Sonos and Bose family of soundbars give you a choice of Google Assistant or Alexa, with the former also allowing you to use Sonos' Voice Control.\nSoundbars can also be voice assistant-compatible, which means that you'll be able to use one or more voice assistants to control the soundbar if you already own a smart speaker or some other way to issue voice commands. Several soundbars can be added to Apple HomeKit, which lets you control them via Siri.\nStill other soundbars, like Vizio's family of products, have dedicated smart speaker inputs so you can wire a Google Nest Mini or Amazon Echo into the soundbar. This lets the soundbar understand when you are trying to talk to your assistant, and it can lower the speaker volume automatically while letting you hear the assistant via the higher-quality soundbar.\nNo, but Apple's HomePod Mini its resurrected 2nd Gen HomePod can act as soundbar replacements if you also own an Apple TV 4K. You can set up a set of HomePods as a stereo pair, which sounds amazing and might just be a good soundbar alternative."

      "text": "Dolby Atmos is the most immersive version of surround sound you can get at home. Though it took some time to catch on, the format is now everywhere, from movie theaters to Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, as well as the world\u2019s streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, and Disney+.\nBut what, exactly, is Dolby Atmos? How is it different from other kinds of surround sound? And perhaps most importantly: If you decide you want to experience Atmos at home, how can you make sure that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re getting? Dolby Atmos can be awesome, but getting it is (unfortunately) a bit more complicated than simply buying a TV or a soundbar with the Dolby Atmos logo on the box.\nJust want to know what all the Dolby Atmos fuss is about? We got you covered. Want to become a Dolby Atmos expert? This guide will get you there, with as little jargon as possible.\nHow to use this guide\nWe\u2019ve organized this ultimate guide to Dolby Atmos into three parts.\nPart 1 covers the basics. If you just want to know what Dolby Atmos is and why you should care, this will explain a few key concepts. The next time Dolby Atmos comes up in conversation, you\u2019ll know exactly what folks are talking about.\nPart 2 gets a little deeper. It\u2019s for people who are seriously thinking of how they can get a Dolby Atmos experience at home, with explanations about the gear you\u2019ll need and how to decipher some of the jargon that gets thrown around, like discrete versus virtual channels, and what numbers like 7.1.4 mean.\nPart 3 is dedicated to navigating the Dolby Atmos ecosystem to make sure you\u2019re actually getting the Dolby Atmos sound you\u2019ve invested in. As with so many things in our technological world, it\u2019s not quite as simple as it should be. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll get into the sneaky gotchas that can come between you and a true Dolby Atmos experience.\nPart 1: what is Dolby Atmos?\nTraditional surround sound literally surrounds you. The sound comes from in front, beside, and sometimes behind you, too. Dolby Atmos takes this to the next logical step, with sound that comes from above. Instead of sitting in a ring of sound, with things coming at you in a fairly flat, directional manner, you\u2019re sitting under a dome of sound.\nAnother characteristic of Dolby Atmos that makes it so immersive \u2014 so \u201c3D\u201d as many people refer to it \u2014 is its ability to move individual sounds around within that dome. It mimics the way sounds work in the real world; you get the sense of motion, not just direction.\nDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t necessarily need to mount speakers to your ceiling to get this effect. (Though doing so will sound incredible.) Thanks to the technology that makes Dolby Atmos possible, there are plenty of ways to experience Dolby Atmos that don\u2019t involve putting holes in drywall or spending thousands of dollars, and we\u2019ll cover many of these options in a moment.\nBefore we do, let\u2019s cover a key concept that will help you understand how Dolby Atmos actually works. Trust me, when we get a little deeper, you\u2019ll be glad we started here.\nMetadata \u2014 Dolby Atmos\u2019 secret sauce\nAt a deeply technical level, Dolby Atmos isn\u2019t actually a soundtrack at all. It\u2019s metadata (extra information about the soundtrack) that is used by compatible audio gear to control which speakers are reproducing certain sounds.\nIn the studio, audio engineers using Dolby Atmos mixing technology are able to treat individual sounds as \u201cobjects,\u201d which can then be moved independently inside that dome of sound. The classic example is the helicopter that flies in from a location behind your right shoulder, then hovers in place overhead for a few seconds before screeching off to somewhere just to the left of your TV screen.\nWhat\u2019s so clever about Atmos is that the movement of the helicopter is represented as a set of instructions (the metadata), not embedded directly into the soundtrack.\nA Dolby Atmos sound system can read that metadata and decide how best to send the helicopter\u2019s movements to your available speakers, ultimately creating a sound experience that is far more immersive than previous surround sound technologies.\nAnd what about Dolby Atmos Music?\nDolby Atmos Music does for music what Dolby Atmos does for movies and there are now plenty of ways to experience it, from Dolby Atmos-capable soundbars and speakers, like the Sonos Arc Ultra and Sonos Era 300, to the wired and wireless headphones you use with your smartphone. It\u2019s impressive when you hear it, but it has different requirements than Dolby Atmos for movies and TV shows, so check out our full Dolby Atmos Music explainer to see if your current gear supports it.\nPart 2: channels, speakers, and gear galore\nReady to experience Dolby Atmos at home? Here\u2019s what you should know before you buy.\nDolby Atmos: the gear you need\nAt a minimum, you need three things to achieve Atmos nirvana.\n- Source: The content itself \u2014 whether it\u2019s a movie or music \u2014 needs to be available in Dolby Atmos.\n- Decoding device: Whether it\u2019s a TV, a streaming device, or a stereo receiver, the gear you\u2019re using has to be compatible with Dolby Atmos.\n- Sound system: If you opt for an AV receiver, soundbar, or some other setup as your sound system, it will also need to be Dolby Atmos compatible.\nDolby Atmos movies, shows, and music\nSources for Dolby Atmos content are now very common. You\u2019ll find Atmos on Blu-ray discs and video streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and many others. For Dolby Atmos Music, your best bets are music streaming services like Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music.\nNot all titles come with Dolby Atmos soundtracks. Older movies typically don\u2019t have them unless they\u2019ve been recently remastered, like the Star Wars franchise on Disney+, but it\u2019s very common on new releases, especially Hollywood blockbusters. Another thing to keep in mind: some streaming services like Netflix, only offer Dolby Atmos as an option when you pay for their most expensive subscription tier.\nDolby Atmos playback devices\nVirtually all Blu-ray players can decode Dolby Atmos from Blu-ray discs. But just to be certain, you may want to check your player\u2019s specifications. With streaming devices like the Apple TV 4K or Google Streamer, etc., it\u2019s much more of a mixed bag. All of the top-end devices from the major manufacturers support Dolby Atmos, but some of the lower-priced models will, too. Again, check the specs to be sure.\nThere\u2019s a very good chance your smart TV also is a Dolby Atmos playback device. If it is, you\u2019ll be able to hear Dolby Atmos from its built-in speakers. (Again, if the content supports it.) But since TV speakers aren\u2019t exactly the best for big, bold, and immersive audio, you\u2019ll want to make sure the TV can also pass Dolby Atmos through to an external device via its HDMI ARC/eARC port. Not sure what that means? We\u2019ll discuss passthrough more in Part 3.\nDolby Atmos sound systems\nThis is the part of the Dolby Atmos equation where you get the greatest range of gear, not to mention levels of investment. As I said earlier, your TV may already comprise a Dolby Atmos sound system. But the odds are good that even if it does, you\u2019ll want something better.\nThe two main types of Dolby Atmos sound systems are AV receiver-based with wired speakers, and Dolby Atmos soundbars, which may also include additional wired or wireless speakers.\nAV receiver component-based systems are considered the gold standard for Dolby Atmos. They give you the most control over the sound because they let you pick each component and place each speaker exactly where you want it to be. If you already own a 5.1 or 7.1 AV receiver-based wired surround sound system, you can keep all of your existing speakers, and then upgrade your system with a Dolby Atmos AV receiver and some additional height-effect speakers. (Which would add another decimal place to result in a 7.1.x or 5.1.x scheme.) Or, your existing AV receiver might already be Dolby Atmos capable, in which case you only need to add height-effect speakers.\nThe downside of AV receiver systems \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve never owned one \u2014 is they tend to be expensive, complicated to install, and not exactly user-friendly when trying to adjust settings.\nThis is why Dolby Atmos soundbars are by far the most popular way to upgrade. They\u2019re simple to set up, they often cost far less than AV receiver-based home theater systems, and some models let you add additional speakers or subwoofers as your needs (and your budget) grow.\nIn the early days of Dolby Atmos soundbars, AV receiver systems held a big lead in terms of sound quality and immersion. More recently, however, we\u2019ve seen Atmos soundbar systems that would satisfy all but the most demanding audio and cinephiles, though not without a considerable investment, ahem, Nakamichi Dragon.\nYou may also run into the term Dolby Atmos FlexConnect. This is a new technology created by Dolby that lets select Dolby Atmos-equipped TVs boost their built-in sound systems by sending sound to additional wireless speakers without the need for a soundbar, an AV receiver, or even an HDMI cable.\nWe have yet to try one of these systems, so we can\u2019t comment on how they perform compared to soundbars or home theater systems, but it\u2019s a good bet they\u2019ll still be better than your TV\u2019s built-in speakers alone.\nWhat about headphones?\nOK, so we\u2019ve covered what you need to get Dolby Atmos sound from your TV speakers, a soundbar, or a home theater speaker system, but there\u2019s one more option: Headphones.\nIt\u2019s possible to get Dolby Atmos for both movies and music via any set of wired or wireless headphones, but you\u2019ll need some specific equipment to make it happen.\nDolby Atmos for movies via headphones\nIf you have an Apple TV 4K, you can connect any set of Bluetooth headphones, and the streaming device will create a virtualized Dolby Atmos experience as long as you\u2019re watching a movie with a Dolby Atmos soundtrack. But if you own a pair of Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro, AirPods third- or fourth-generation, or AirPods Max, the Apple TV will also enable head-tracking spatial audio \u2014 an even more immersive version of Dolby Atmos (and multichannel surround) that simulates what it\u2019s like to listen without any headphones at all. It\u2019s quite magical.\nYou can get the same experience (without the head tracking) on any mobile phone or tablet that supports Dolby Atmos.\nDolby Atmos Music via headphones\nIf you subscribe to Apple Music, Tidal, or Amazon Music, you can hear Dolby Atmos Music via your headphones \u2014 provided that these services have published a version of their apps that are compatible with your phone, and you\u2019ve selected a Dolby Atmos Music version of the song you want to hear. Not all songs are available in Dolby Atmos. (Again, that goes back to the whole source/device/system thing from earlier.)\nDolby Atmos: what are all of those numbers for?\nSurround sound soundtracks and sound systems are defined by channels. A channel is a unique set of sounds, typically assigned to a single speaker. When you see surround sound described as Dolby 5.1, that means the soundtrack includes five channels of surround sound (front left, front right, center, surround left, and surround right) plus one channel dedicated to low-frequency effects \u2014 usually handled by a subwoofer.\nDolby Atmos soundtracks add the missing overhead components that give you the dome of sound. But here\u2019s where it can get a bit confusing.\nDolby Atmos is scalable. As long as your AV receiver or soundbar is Dolby Atmos-compatible, it will do its best to deliver a Dolby Atmos experience regardless of whether it has two speakers or two dozen speakers. That\u2019s why Dolby Atmos soundtracks don\u2019t use the typical 5.1 (or 7.1 or 9.1) designations. They\u2019re just labeled as Dolby Atmos.\nSo why are some Dolby Atmos sound systems advertised with designations like 5.1.4 or even 11.4.6? This is an attempt on the part of the manufacturer to give you a sense of the system\u2019s capability \u2014 how immersive it will sound when you use it. The reality is, your Dolby Atmos experience will depend in large part on the number of drivers (the individual components that produce sound) and the number of speakers (the physical boxes containing the drivers) in your sound system.\nWe\u2019ll discuss the specifics in the next section. But for now, here\u2019s a primer on what these numbers are supposed to represent.\nThe first two numbers that describe a Dolby Atmos sound system are the same as a traditional surround system \u2014 the first number connotes the horizontally arranged channels and the second number is the low-frequency channel. Atmos adds a third number, which represents the \u201cheight\u201d channels \u2014 the channels that give us that overhead dome of sound effect.\nThere are tons of combinations, but here are some examples to give you a sense of what we\u2019re talking about:\n- 3.1.2 \u2014 front left, front right, and center channels, plus a subwoofer, and left and right height channels\n- 5.1.4 \u2014 front left/right, center, surround left/right, a sub, and two sets of height channels (front height left/right and rear height left/right)\n- 9.1.6 \u2014 front left/right, center, wide left/right, surround left/right, rear left/right, a sub, and three sets of height channels (front height left/right, middle height left/right, and rear height left/right)\nYou may also see systems that use a number greater than 1 to represent the low-frequency subwoofer channel e.g. 9.2.4 or even 9.4.4. This means the manufacturer has decided to include multiple subwoofers, for better management (and power) of low frequencies. But because Atmos only has one low-frequency channel, each of these subwoofers gets the same signal.\nHow far can you go? Dolby Atmos supports up to 64 speaker locations, so the sky is almost the limit.\nThis triple-digit system represents a best-case scenario. In other words, as in the diagram above, there should be one physical speaker for every channel. However, because some Dolby Atmos systems use virtualization, there can be far fewer physical speakers than channels, and this can mean dramatically different results (see the next section).\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that your chosen system needs to be of the right scope, scale, and power for your room, otherwise, you could end up with a big invoice and a system that doesn\u2019t sound as good as it could.\nDolby Atmos: discrete and virtual channels\nThere are two ways that a Dolby Atmos system can deliver sound channels: discretely, and virtually.\nDiscrete channels mean that there\u2019s a direct source of sound for each channel. In this perfect world, it\u2019s one speaker for each channel, including the right number of ceiling speakers for the height channels. But making that happen requires a Dolby Atmos AV receiver, lots of speaker wire, and probably some drywall cutting and repair, so a second discrete option exists: Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers.\nDolby Atmos-enabled speakers achieve their height channels by bouncing sound off your ceiling toward you instead of projecting it directly down at you.\nMore on Dolby Atmos\n- How to install Dolby Atmos ceiling speakers\n- The best Dolby Atmos movies, from Ready Player One to the new Jumanji movie\n- How do you re-create the air-ripping launch of 11,000-hp dragsters? Dolby Atmos\nAV receiver owners can buy full-size tower or bookshelf speakers that have these extra, angled drivers built-in, or you can add just the angled driver as its own speaker, which you\u2019d place on top of your existing speakers.\nYou can even mix and match. Perhaps you initially installed two ceiling speakers but you now want a second set of height channels, and you don\u2019t want to cut new holes in your drywall. You could add Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers instead, (assuming your AV receiver is able to support four or more height channels).\nThe shape of your room and the height and angles of your ceiling all play a role in determining the right solution.\nSoundbars can have the equivalent of Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers too, but we refer to these as \u201cup-firing\u201d drivers, which can be located in the main soundbar as well as in surround speakers if your soundbar has these.\nVirtual channels mean that the sound system uses software known as digital signal processing (DSP) to create \u201cphantom speakers\u201d in your room in place of real speakers. Using the principles of psychoacoustics, it\u2019s possible for instance, for two speakers in the front of your room to simulate an additional two surround speakers. It\u2019s even possible to virtualize height channels, though this effect is usually less convincing than virtual surround channels.\nThese virtualized channels can\u2019t fully replace real speakers, but we\u2019ve been shocked at just how convincing some virtualized systems can be. Bose, Sennheiser, and Sony each have created Dolby Atmos soundbars that virtualize up to six channels, and they sound amazing.\nHowever, we need to point out a major caveat with virtualization. There is no universal standard for how virtualization is accomplished. This can lead to wildly different results between brands and models. Moreover, from a marketing point of view, Dolby Labs doesn\u2019t distinguish between Dolby Atmos sound systems.\nEvery system that supports Dolby Atmos technology receives the Dolby Atmos label, regardless of how well it achieves Atmos\u2019 promise of 3D immersion. It\u2019s this situation that has led us to question whether the Dolby Atmos label on a product has a direct relationship to a specific sound experience, or whether it\u2019s simply a brand at this point.\nAs an example, in the photos above are two Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbars. Both claim to reproduce 7.1.4-channel sound, but the Ambeo Soundbar Plus has nine drivers to work with, while the Ambeo Soundbar Mini only has six. As you might expect, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus delivers a much more immersive performance (it also costs considerably more).\nAs guidance, we suggest you do two things before buying. First, as always: Read the reviews. Experts who have had a chance to hear many different systems in action will be able to tell you how a given model compares to its peers. Second: It\u2019s not a rule, but generally speaking the greater the number of individual drivers in a soundbar, the better the virtualization effect will be. It\u2019s simple physics \u2014 two forward-facing drivers can\u2019t create as complex a sound field as five or more drivers, each separated by a few inches of space, and positioned at different angles to the listening area.\nPart 3: Are you actually getting Dolby Atmos sound?\nYou\u2019ve done all your homework. You\u2019ve got a source of Atmos content that\u2019s being played by an Atmos-capable device and it\u2019s all being routed through a Dolby Atmos sound system. So why doesn\u2019t it sound like you\u2019re actually getting Dolby Atmos?\nTo get to the bottom of this vexing problem, there are a few more concepts we need to cover.\nDolby Atmos: lossy and lossless audio\nDolby Atmos metadata piggybacks on a traditional surround sound signal. This is why Atmos is backward compatible with non-Atmos sound systems \u2014 the non-Atmos system doesn\u2019t know what to do with the metadata, so it ignores it and just plays the traditional surround portion that it recognizes.\nThere are two flavors of Dolby surround sound that can let Atmos metadata tag along for the ride:\n- Dolby TrueHD\n- Dolby Digital Plus\nDolby TrueHD is a lossless, high-resolution, multichannel surround sound format. In terms of home theater sound, it\u2019s the gold standard. However, TrueHD\u2019s massive bandwidth requirements make it an impractical choice for streaming services, so, at the moment, it\u2019s pretty much restricted to Blu-rays and Ultra HD 4K Blu-rays.\nDolby Digital Plus can carry the same content as TrueHD, but it uses a lossy, lower-bandwidth format making it the de facto standard for Dolby Atmos on all streaming services. The size difference between the two formats in terms of bitrate is huge. A Dolby Digital Plus soundtrack with Dolby Atmos metadata typically uses between 384 and 768 kbps of bandwidth. The same content in TrueHD uses an average of 6,000 kbps, but can soar as high as 18,000 kbps because there\u2019s no upper limit on TrueHD\u2019s bitrate.\nNeedless to say, Dolby Atmos over Dolby Digital Plus will be the way most people experience Atmos. For the Atmos Music fans out there, it\u2019s the same story \u2014 Atmos Music on Blu-ray will most likely use TrueHD, while streaming services will use Dolby Digital Plus. The one exception (if you can find them) is hi-res music download sites.\nDolby Atmos: HDMI-only\nIn most cases, HDMI is a requirement for sending Dolby Atmos from a TV to an external sound system. The only exception to this when using select Samsung or LG TV/soundbar combos (these are capable of wireless Dolby Atmos).\nHDMI is needed because Both Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus versions of Atmos contain more data than a digital optical connection can handle.\nHowever, there are three possible HDMI paths that Dolby Atmos can take to get to your sound system, each with a slightly different set of considerations:\n- Direct HDMI from your source device to your sound system\n- Direct HDMI from your TV to your sound system\n- Indirect HDMI from your source device via your TV to your sound system\nDirect HDMI from your source device to your sound system\nIf you use a Dolby Atmos AV receiver, you will most likely connect your source device (Blu-ray player, streaming media player, etc.) directly to the AV receiver and then let the receiver send the video portion of the signal to your TV. If your Dolby Atmos soundbar has an HDMI video input (many don\u2019t), you can use your soundbar the same way. These connections not only guarantee the best audio quality, but they\u2019re the only way to get Dolby Atmos sound if your TV isn\u2019t Dolby Atmos compatible. These connections work with both Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus.\nDirect HDMI from your TV to your sound system\nIf your smart TV is Dolby Atmos compatible, you don\u2019t have to use any other third-party source devices, as long as your smart TV\u2019s apps are also Dolby Atmos-capable. In this case, you\u2019ll use your TV\u2019s HDMI ARC/eARC port to connect to your AV receiver or soundbar\u2019s HDMI ARC/eARC port via an HDMI cable. Since virtually all of your Dolby Atmos content will be streamed and thus in Dolby Digital Plus, it won\u2019t matter if your TV only has HDMI ARC or the newer HDMI eARC \u2014 Dolby Atmos with Dolby Digital Plus will work with both. However \u2026\nIndirect HDMI from your source device via your TV to your sound system\nIf you want to use a source device but you don\u2019t own an AV receiver or your soundbar doesn\u2019t have any HDMI video inputs, you\u2019ll need to use your TV as a passthrough that can transmit Dolby Atmos from the source device to your soundbar \u2014 and this where your TV\u2019s HDMI port version matters.\nAlmost all new TVs from 2020 and onward have HDMI eARC. If your TV has eARC, it will pass through any version of Dolby Atmos to your soundbar.\nDolby Atmos capable TVs that only have HDMI ARC should be able to pass through Dolby Digital Plus to your soundbar, but they won\u2019t be able to pass through Dolby TrueHD. Much like an optical connection can\u2019t handle the bandwidth of Dolby Digital Plus, HDMI ARC can\u2019t handle TrueHD. If your source material is only available in Dolby TrueHD, you may not get any sound at all. This can also affect Dolby Atmos from the Apple TV 4K, even though it doesn\u2019t use Dolby TrueHD.\nHowever, some Dolby Atmos TVs with HDMI ARC are able to downconvert Dolby TrueHD to Dolby Digital Plus, while preserving Dolby Atmos metadata. If your TV can do this, you\u2019ll still get Dolby Atmos to your soundbar, even if your source content was in TrueHD.\nIf you\u2019re using an optical cable to connect your TV to your soundbar or your AV receiver, these signals will be converted into a simpler surround format, like Dolby Digital 5.1, before they get transmitted. The sound you hear will still be really good, but it won\u2019t be Atmos.\nFiles, apps, and hardware\nWe\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s worth repeating: for Dolby Atmos to work, every ingredient in your home theater setup has to support Atmos. In other words:\n- The movie you\u2019re playing \u2014 whether it\u2019s physical, downloaded, or streamed \u2014 has to be encoded with Dolby Atmos (via Dolby TrueHD or Dolby Digital Plus).\n- The hardware you\u2019re playing it on has to be able to decode Dolby Atmos. If it can\u2019t, it needs to be able to pass it along to a Dolby Atmos-capable sound system without altering it. This is known as \u201cpassthrough.\u201d\n- The app you\u2019re using \u2014 e.g. Plex, Netflix, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, etc. \u2014 must be capable of delivering Dolby Atmos data to your playback device.\n- And, of course, your TV, AV receiver, or soundbar must be Dolby Atmos compatible, if that\u2019s the device you\u2019re using to listen to audio.\nTo make life more complicated, just because your app of choice supports Dolby Atmos on some devices, that doesn\u2019t mean it necessarily supports it on all devices. For instance: Plex running on an Nvidia Shield TV can pass through Atmos over Dolby TrueHD, and over Dolby Digital Plus, but Plex on an Apple TV 4K will only handle Atmos over Dolby Digital Plus, and Plex on a fourth-generation Apple TV can\u2019t pass through Dolby Atmos at all.\nIf you\u2019re playing an Atmos-encoded Ultra HD Blu-ray on an Ultra HD Blu-ray player that\u2019s connected to an Atmos-capable TV, soundbar, or AV receiver via HDMI, we can pretty much guarantee you\u2019re getting the full Dolby Atmos experience. We can\u2019t say the same about some other device combinations.\nHere are a few examples where you will not get Dolby Atmos sound:\n- Playing an Atmos-encoded Netflix movie on an Apple TV HD (4th gen, non-4K) connected to an Atmos-capable AV receiver. In this scenario, the Apple TV is the weakest link: It doesn\u2019t support Dolby Atmos. You\u2019ll be limited to 5.1 Dolby Digital Plus surround sound.\n- Playing any Dolby Atmos-encoded content on a Roku Streaming Stick+ that\u2019s attached to a Dolby Atmos capable TV, with an Atmos soundbar connected via optical cable. The obstacle here is the optical connection to the soundbar. You\u2019ve got Atmos content on a device that can support Atmos, on a TV that can pass through Atmos, but because you\u2019re using an optical cable instead of HDMI ARC/eARC, the TV has to down-convert the audio to Dolby Digital 5.1 (otherwise known as AC-3), because optical connections cannot cope with the higher bandwidth requirements of Dolby Digital Plus.\n- Using the built-in Plex client on an LG OLED TV to play a movie encoded with Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Atmos, with an Atmos soundbar connected via HDMI ARC. This is a really frustrating one \u2014 all of the sources and components are Atmos-capable, but because the Plex client on the LG TV isn\u2019t yet optimized to handle TrueHD/Atmos, it down-converts the audio to Dolby 5.1 \u2014 even though both the TV itself and the connected soundbar could have easily handled the TrueHD/Atmos track.\nHow do I know if I\u2019m getting Dolby Atmos?\nBecause Dolby Atmos systems can upmix any surround sound signals they get, it can be tricky to know if you\u2019re getting true Dolby Atmos or upmixed two-channel, 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. From an audible point of view, if you\u2019re getting Atmos, you should be able to detect sounds as they appear to move from one area of the room to another. Rainfall, bullet ricochets, and whizzing cars are all good candidates for this.\nThey won\u2019t just move from front to back or side to side; they should also occasionally sound as though they\u2019re coming from overhead, or somewhere above the screen.\nStill not certain? The one surefire way to confirm Dolby Atmos is working is to check the information panel on the front of your AV receiver or your soundbar (if it has one, or perhaps an LED indicator, or an on-screen display). It should display the kind of audio signal it\u2019s currently working with. If the display doesn\u2019t specifically say \u201cAtmos\u201d or \u201cDolby Atmos,\u201d then the odds are that you\u2019re not getting Atmos. Checking the display is likely easier than queuing up the right soundtrack for a rainfall or ricochet sound check.\nSome Atmos soundbars, like the Sonos Arc, Bose Smart Soundbar 900, and LG S95QR, will show you the audio signal within their respective mobile apps for iOS and Android.\nOne more thing\nWe have one last troubleshooting trick up our sleeves for those of you who still can\u2019t get Atmos to appear despite exhausting all the protocols mentioned above. TVs and streaming devices have different settings for their digital audio outputs. Most of the time, they\u2019re set to \u201cauto\u201d by default, which is what you want.\nBut sometimes, they end up in PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) mode, which strips out Dolby Atmos metadata. Perhaps you have troubleshot your device every way you know how and still can\u2019t pick up Dolby Atmos. In that case, we recommend you navigate its settings to see if it\u2019s in PCM mode. If it\u2019s set to PCM, change it to Auto or Bitstream.\nThere may also be more than one settings menu. On the PlayStation 4, if you want to play Blu-ray discs with Dolby Atmos, you need to confirm that both the main system audio settings and the audio settings for your Blu-ray disc itself are set to Bitstream. Not all setups are compatible with Dolby Atmos, so if this doesn\u2019t work either, you might have an incompatible system.\nAchieving proper Dolby Atmos requires a bit of diligence and technical know-how on your part, but it\u2019s totally worth it. The result is a clearer, richer sound that surpasses 5.1 or 7.1 surround. We have created the diagram above to provide you with the proper guidelines to ensure that your Atmos setup goes off without a hitch. Once you dial in your files, hardware, apps, and settings, you should be able to achieve an impressive Dolby Atmos sound that\u2019s worth all the effort."
