      "summary": "The United Arab Emirates has warned that any Israeli annexation of the West Bank would be a \"red line,\" cautioning that it could undermine the Abraham Accords and regional integration. This statement comes amid Israel’s intensified offensive in Gaza, where overnight strikes have killed at least 31 people and sparked nationwide protests in Israel over the call-up of 60,000 reserves. The UAE’s warning underscores its role in the 2020 Abraham Accords and its concern that annexation would derail the two‑state solution and broader peace trajectory.",
