  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None The company has its detractors, and one chimed in with a research update.\n\u2022 None In doing so, he reiterated his sell recommendation in no uncertain terms.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Strategy \u203a\n\nA negative analyst note published before market open on Thursday was the wet blanket that dampened Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) stock. The company, now transformed into almost a pure-play Bitcoin investor, saw its shares slump to close the day almost 2% lower in price. That compared unfavorably to the S&P 500, which shed a comparatively modest 0.4%.\n\nThe prognosticator who authored the Strategy update was Gus Gal\u00e1 of Monness, Crespi, Hardt. In the note, Gal\u00e1 reiterated his sell recommendation and $175 price target on the company. That's far below the stock's most recent closing price of $337.58.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAccording to reports, Gal\u00e1 zeroed in on several discouraging elements of Strategy's business in the note. He expressed concern about the premium valuation of the stock versus its total Bitcoin holdings. And he believes that the company might take hits to its financial strength with its growing load of convertible bonds (issued to, of course, raise funds to buy more Bitcoin).\n\nRegarding convertible bonds, they either remain as debt or are converted into equity. The danger for an issuer of such securities is that they could weigh down a balance sheet with excessive debt, or on the other hand be quite dilutive to existing shareholders if many holders convert to equity.\n\nAnother danger for any company with heavy Bitcoin exposure -- and Strategy is Exhibit A for this grouping -- is that it's very exposed to developments with its favorite asset. Lately Bitcoin has been performing well, at times shattering all-time highs. However, even though it's at the top of its asset class, it's still a cryptocurrency -- and as ever, cryptos can be volatile investments.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Strategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Strategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Strategy wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $654,624!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,075,117!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,049% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 183% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nEric Volkman has positions in Bitcoin. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin.

      "text": "A convertible bond is a type of debt security that allows investors to exchange their bonds for a specific number of common shares. Convertible bonds can be a good addition to a diversified portfolio, but they come with unique terminology and calculations. Here, we\u2019ll define convertible bonds and explain the different types, as well as the pros and cons of owning them. We\u2019ll also answer some frequently asked questions about convertible bonds.\nUnderstanding convertible bonds\nUnderstanding convertible bonds\nConvertible bonds are fixed income securities that can be converted into common stock shares. (Sometimes they\u2019re just called \u201cconvertibles.\u201d) This conversion can take place at the discretion of the investor, i.e., the bondholder, or it may be mandatory. Conversion can happen at various times over the bond\u2019s life.\nConvertibles provide an interesting option to bondholders if the corporation\u2019s equity shares significantly increase in price.\nA convertible bond\u2019s conversion price is specified in the bond\u2019s indenture agreement, which is released at bond origination. The conversion price is the price at which an investor can convert their bond into stock shares. It\u2019s typically set higher than the current equity share price.\nA convertible bond\u2019s conversion ratio is the number of stock shares an investor will receive should they choose to convert their bond. A bond with a face value of $1,000 and a conversion price of $20 has a conversion ratio of 50, meaning it could be exchanged for 50 stock shares.\nTypes of convertible bonds\nTypes of convertible bonds\nThere are a few different types of convertible bonds to review, including the vanilla convertible bond and the mandatory convertible bond.\n- A vanilla convertible bond is a standard convertible bond. An investor can either hold the bond to maturity and receive the bond\u2019s face value, or they can convert it to equity shares and benefit from a rise in the issuer\u2019s stock price. Vanilla convertible bonds offer a lower yield to investors because they also provide the option, but not the obligation, to convert to equity shares.\n- A mandatory convertible bond functions as advertised: An investor\u2019s bonds will automatically convert by a certain date specified in the bond\u2019s indenture agreement. With mandatory convertibles, the investor earns a higher return prior to mandatory conversion. After conversion, returns could be higher or lower, depending on the issuer\u2019s equity performance.\nPros and cons of convertible bonds\nPros and cons of convertible bonds\nOwning convertible bonds comes with various advantages and disadvantages. Here are the basic pros and cons:\nPros of convertible bonds\n- Optionality: Given uncertain bond and equity prices, many investors like the idea of being in control. If equity prices rise past the conversion price, an investor holding a convertible bond can exchange their bonds for common shares and earn a profit.\n- Guaranteed income: Although it may not be a tremendous amount of income, convertible bonds do provide guaranteed income nonetheless. In volatile equity markets, guaranteed income streams are all the more valuable.\n- Higher upside than corporate bonds: Even though convertible bonds will offer a lower yield than corporates at bond origination, they have the potential to more than make up for the difference upon conversion to common shares.\n- Protection from issuer default: If the bond hasn\u2019t yet been converted, a convertible bondholder will be paid before common stockholders if the issuer defaults. Priority in liquidation can be an important feature in the event of unexpected financial trouble.\n- Diversification benefit: Hybrid securities such as convertibles (as well as preferred stocks) offer an added diversification benefit to a portfolio of standard stock and bond investments.\nCons of convertible bonds\n- Low yields: Relative to other corporate bonds, convertible bonds will offer a lower yield along with a conversion option. If the issuer\u2019s stock price never reaches the conversion price, the investor may instead hold the bond until maturity at a lower yield.\n- Increased portfolio complexity: Retail investors may not have the inclination to add hybrid securities to a basic portfolio. If keeping things simple is a priority, convertible bonds may not be a good option.\n- Riskier than corporate bonds: Should the issuer enter bankruptcy, convertible bondholders will be paid back after most other classes of debt, including corporates.\n- High correlation to equity markets. Intermediate price movements within convertible bond security markets are highly correlated to stock prices, which may remove some of the advertised diversification benefit. Convertibles trading at or near their conversion price will display higher volatility.\n- Less liquid than other bond classes: Convertible bonds may trade in markets with greater bid-ask spreads, and as a result, less liquidity. Selling large blocks of convertible securities may be difficult to do without receiving a lower price for certain tranches.\nExample\nExample\nSay an investor were to purchase a convertible bond with a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 2%. As long as the investor holds the bond, they\u2019ll receive a coupon payment of $20 annually, or $10 semi-annually. The investor, while guaranteed a modest stream of income, is likely to have purchased the bond not for the interest payments but for a potential rise in the issuer\u2019s equity share price.\nImagine that, at the same time, the investor is also able to convert the bond to equity shares at a conversion price of $15. This implies a conversion ratio of 66.67 ($1,000/$15). In other words, if the investor chooses to convert the bond to equity shares, they\u2019d receive 66 shares (plus a fraction) in exchange.\nIt will only make sense for the investor to convert the bond to stock shares if the market price of the issuer\u2019s equity exceeds the conversion price. If the price is less than the conversion price, converting the bond will result in a loss; above the conversion price, the investor will see unrealized profit. Unless the bond is a mandatory convertible bond, there is no guarantee that the investor will ever convert the bond.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on convertible bonds\nConvertible bonds are unique securities that can play a role in an investor\u2019s diversified portfolio. Convertibles are usually appealing to investors who are willing to accept lower returns in the short run in the hope of striking it big down the line. From a company\u2019s perspective, convertible bond issuances are a way of lowering its cost of debt in a tax-efficient manner.\nAs with any investment, there is a risk of loss with convertible bonds. Before investing, be sure to understand what you\u2019re signing up for, and realize that losses are possible. If the risks are worth the rewards in your scenario, convertible bonds might be worth a second look.\nConvertible Bonds FAQs\nWhat is a forced conversion?\nA forced conversion happens when a bond issuer mandates conversion of its hybrid securities. This is more likely to happen if the issuer\u2019s equity price hasn\u2019t yet reached its conversion price. After all, most convertible bondholders would convert on their own if the conversion price had been met.\nA forced conversion can throw off your plans and expectations as a convertible bondholder, so it\u2019s vital to know if forced conversions are permitted in the bond\u2019s indenture agreement.\nCan you lose money on convertible bonds?\nAbsolutely. This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most direct way would be if the issuing company were to declare bankruptcy or enter involuntary liquidation. Convertible bondholders will recover their investment after corporate bondholders but before common stockholders.\nNext, convertible bond prices will move with stock price and/or interest rate movements. Prices can be volatile, and convertible bonds trade in relatively illiquid markets.\nLike with most stock and bond investments, principal is at risk if any one of a variety of events take place.\nWho can issue convertible bonds?\nAny company looking to finance operations through debt can theoretically issue convertible bonds. Convertibles allow a company to pay a lower rate of interest on its debt and still receive tax-deductible debt financing.\nStart-ups that have yet to meaningfully increase their revenue -- and also have yet to develop a strong credit rating -- might be ideal candidates to issue convertible bonds. Issuing convertibles offers investors an opportunity to participate in big upside should the company take off in the future."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Bitcoin (BTC -1.63%), the cryptocurrency that started it all, made some fortunate investors billions. Before it was the leader of a multi-trillion-dollar crypto market, Bitcoin was just an idea described in a white paper. For a better idea of how Bitcoin works and what makes it so special, let's look back at the Bitcoin white paper and why it's important.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is a white paper?\nA white paper is a document that provides information about a technology, product, or service. Most white papers are written in an academic style and focus on providing technical information to prospective investors and users. In Bitcoin's case, the white paper explained how it would work and the problems it would solve.\nCryptocurrency\nImportance\nImportance of a white paper\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and because it was introducing an entirely new concept, the white paper was a crucial part of explaining its plans. The Bitcoin white paper needed to describe the weaknesses in the current electronic payment systems and how it would work as a peer-to-peer digital currency.\nMany subsequent cryptocurrencies have followed Bitcoin's lead by publishing their own white papers. The documents are often one of the best ways for people to learn about cryptocurrency projects.\nOverview\nBitcoin white paper overview\nThe nine-page Bitcoin white paper is called \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" It was released on Oct. 31, 2008, by an anonymous author who went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. To better understand Bitcoin, here's a breakdown of the 12 sections in its white paper:\n1. Introduction\nNakamoto starts by describing the electronic payments system and its weaknesses. Since it relies on financial institutions that need to resolve disputes, there's no way to have non-reversible transactions. Businesses must accept a certain percentage of fraud as the cost of doing business and get personal information from their customers for added security.\nThe proposed solution was a distributed timestamp server to record a series of cryptographically signed transactions in a public ledger. The purpose for the Bitcoin network would be to enable secure digital currency transactions without the need for a trusted middleman -- in other words, to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment network. In the following sections of the white paper, Nakamoto went into detail on all the system components.\n2. Transactions\nA major challenge with a digital currency is finding a way to solve the double-spend problem (the possibility of a user spending the same funds twice). The traditional solution has been for a trusted central authority to check transactions. However, this means that the entire system relies on one entity.\nTo do this without a central authority, Nakamoto's solution was for transactions to be publicly announced. For his solution to work, all the participants needed a way to record the order of transactions and agree on them. Publishing each block of transactions as they are added to the blockchain would allow all distributed Bitcoin nodes to agree on their order and remain synchronized. It also would allow payment recipients to be sure that the funds they received were not previously spent.\n3. Timestamp server\nThe timestamp server is the first part of how Bitcoin solves the double-spend problem by providing verifiable evidence that a particular block existed on the blockchain at a particular time.\nA Bitcoin block generally contains multiple transactions. All of the information from a Bitcoin block is crunched into a mathematical hash function, which creates a shorter, unique string of characters called a hash. This hash is a short way of verifying the integrity of the original block data. The bitcoin miner adding a new block to the blockchain will timestamp the block's hash. This hash will include the previous block's timestamp, too, so the hashes form a chain of information, each one reinforcing the ones before it.\n4. Proof of work\nFor Bitcoin to work, it needs a way to validate transactions and timestamp them. It does that with a proof-of-work system.\nAs mentioned in the section above, every block of transactions has a hash associated with it. In Bitcoin's proof-of-work system, network nodes, or miners, compete to complete a block with a unique number called a nonce in such a way that the block's hashed value is lower than a targeted hash value. The difficulty of guessing a hash that is lower than the targeted hash value is adjustable to achieve the desired number of average blocks per hour. Finding the correct value satisfies the requirements of proof of work because it demonstrates that the nodes have expended computing power.\nAs the Bitcoin white paper describes it, this is essentially a one-CPU, one-vote system. If honest nodes control a majority of the CPU power, then there will be an accurate, honest blockchain.\n5. Network\nOn the Bitcoin network, transactions are broadcast to every node. Each node collects new transactions into a block. Then it works on finding the correct hash value for the block to satisfy the proof-of-work requirement. Once a node does that, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\nIf all the transactions in that block are valid, then nodes accept it and move on to start trying to mine the following block on that chain. They show they've accepted it by adding it to the system and beginning work on the next block of transactions. Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one. This is important because in the rare event of a \"tie,\" miners could end up working on two alternate forks. However, as soon as one of them is successful at adding the next block, it will become the longest chain, and all nodes will then recognize it as the definitive blockchain.\n6. Incentive\nNodes are the backbone of the Bitcoin network. To encourage honest participation, the system has a built-in reward for the creator of each block. The creator is the node that first solved a block's proof-of-work requirement and broadcast it to the other nodes.\nThe first transaction in a new block issues a new coin to the creator of that block. The block reward can be funded by newly minted coins, making it a way to introduce more coins into circulation. It can also be funded with transaction fees. In fact, after the full supply of Bitcoin has been mined in the future, mining rewards will come solely from transaction fees.\n7. Reclaiming disk space\nOlder Bitcoin transactions can be hashed into a Merkle Tree. A Merkle Tree saves space by using a summary hash of multiple transaction hashes and freeing nodes from having to refer to them all individually to validate past transactions. Simply put, this allows older blocks of transactions to be compacted, reducing the amount of storage required for the blockchain.\n8. Simplified payment verification\nUsers don't need to have a copy of the entire blockchain to verify payments. They can link a transaction to a block using the timestamp. Although they can't check the transaction themselves, they can confirm it was accepted by network nodes. This is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network.\n9. Combining and splitting value\nTransactions consist of inputs and outputs, which allows values to be split and combined. Each transaction can have either a single input (matching the output of another transaction) or multiple smaller inputs. A transaction can have up to two outputs -- one for sending a payment and another (if necessary) for returning change to the sender.\n10. Privacy\nIn the traditional banking system, only the financial institutions and the parties involved have access to information about a transaction. For example, if you transfer $50 to a friend, that information is only available to you, your friend, and your respective banks.\nSince Bitcoin transactions are broadcast to nodes and recorded on a public ledger, privacy is maintained using anonymous public keys. The public key is an address to a Bitcoin wallet, which doesn't contain any information about the owner of the wallet. The white paper notes that a new key pair (with a new address) should be used for each transaction to preserve privacy.\n11. Calculations\nThe only way for an attacker to steal Bitcoin would be to change one of their own transactions and take back funds they recently spent. To do this, they would need to wait until the transaction was confirmed on the blockchain so the recipient sees it. Then the attacker would need to change that transaction and build their own \"attacker chain\" that catches up to and exceeds the correct blockchain.\nThe probability of success is very low, and the longer an attacker waits to start their own chain, the more the chances of success fall. In this section, Nakamoto provides calculations to consider how many blocks would need to be added before a recipient could be confident the sender can't change the transaction.\n12. Conclusion\nNakamoto concludes with a recap of the white paper and summarizing all the different components of Bitcoin and how they work together to create a secure electronic payment system that doesn't rely on trust between parties.\nChanges to Bitcoin since 2008\nChanges to Bitcoin since 2008\nAlthough Bitcoin has largely followed the blueprint Nakamoto created, there have been changes to what was described in the white paper:\n- Nakamoto inserted a 1MB block size limit into the Bitcoin code in 2010. Without a block size limit, miners may not have agreed on block sizes, causing the blockchain to split.\n- While Nakamoto described proof of work as \"one-CPU, one-vote,\" miners progressed to using ASICs, which are more powerful devices designed for Bitcoin mining. They also began working together in mining pools. This has made mining more centralized and energy-intensive than originally envisioned.\n- Bitcoin can now be used with the Lightning Network, a protocol designed to offer small, instant Bitcoin payments, improving scalability.\n- Bitcoin has gone through multiple hard forks, which is when a new blockchain splits from the current blockchain. The most famous Bitcoin fork is Bitcoin Cash (BCH -0.78%), created when some members of the Bitcoin community wanted to increase its block size limit for more efficient transactions.\nThe biggest change to Bitcoin wasn't any technical update but in how it's used. It was designed as electronic cash, but it's now widely considered closer to digital gold. Instead of being a currency that people use regularly, it's more a store of value.\nRelated investing topics\nThe future of Bitcoin\nThe future of Bitcoin\nDue to its popularity, Bitcoin adoption has been steadily increasing. It's legal tender in multiple countries, and more than 15,000 businesses worldwide accept it. It's also one of the most popular choices for those investing in cryptocurrency. However, it has attracted criticism for its mining process, which uses as much energy as a medium-sized country.\nTo their credit, many Bitcoin miners have been seeking out renewable energy sources. Since lower energy prices drastically increase the profitability of Bitcoin mining, the move toward renewable energy will likely be an important next step in Bitcoin's development."
