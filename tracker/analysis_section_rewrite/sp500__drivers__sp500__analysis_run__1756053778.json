      "feedback": "The draft has a solid base-case Regime A anchored in AI/TFP productivity (NL5YYTLF2) and a plausible long-horizon link to disciplined capex and high-moat earnings, with Ford’s EV-cycle metrics (EV losses ~ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ~ 4.3%; ROIC ~ 10.1%; revenue CAGR 2.5% 2014–2024) and ACMR’s 2025 revenue midpoint (~$900m; GM ~4%) providing tangible anchors, but it needs a world-class upgrade in structure and specificity; to achieve that, (1) define Regimes A/B/C with explicit, testable numeric thresholds (e.g., inflation/y/y and wage-growth cross multi-quarter thresholds; automation-exposure level Z%) and map how each regime changes the macro, policy, flows/positions, and valuation vectors, so the causal chain is traversable and testable; (2) deliver an integrated cross-topic map: show a single, end-to-end mechanism from AI uptake to capex discipline to earnings in high-moat firms, with clear lag structure, feedbacks, and where each topic most influence pricing (rates, FX, risk premia) and where it does not, avoiding parallel, disjoint sections; (3) deepen first-principles grounding and fragility analysis by explaining why productivity gains translate to durable earnings without being overrun by labor slack, supply constraints, or policy space limits, including a concise optionality/fragility check; (4) tighten quantification: extract and place exact numbers from each source after every factual claim (verify ACMR 2025 figures and confirm GM, revenue, and margin numbers; keep Ford details precise and cite 22PL3Q360 for the auto-cycle context), and present all key figures as ranges or explicit point estimates with confidence bands; (5) enforce citation discipline: attach a source tag after every factual assertion, reconcile any conflicts between NL5YYTLF2 and 37UZC9X8I (regime transitions) or other IDs, and avoid conflating regime labels (A vs 1 vs Regime) across sources; (6) replace the current“watch list” prose with a crisp five-to-seven-point triggers table in-text: each trigger (threshold, horizon, and explicit invalidation signal) and the likely market/earnings implication; (7) fix truncations and formatting gaps (confirm and complete the ACMR line; ensure every claim rests on an ID from the six sources); (8) add a compact base-case vs bear/bull scenario set with approximate sensitivities to 10Y yield, EV/capex repricing, and AI-uptake tempo; (9) align the output to SECTION FOCUS by delivering a single, cohesive synthesis paragraph plus a short watch-list and a risk caveat, and (10) keep the final prose concise and precise, removing repetition and ensuring each assertion has a source-backed basis.",
