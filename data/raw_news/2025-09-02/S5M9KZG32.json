  "content": "Q: China and America Are Locked in a High-Stakes AI Race. How Do Their Tactics Differ?\n\nSilicon Valley and Beijing are both making big investments in AI, but they have different priorities. Reporters Josh Chin and Raffaele Huang discuss their divergent visions.\n\nA: The U.S. is spending billions in a rush to beat China to the next evolutionary leap in AI. China is running a different race.\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT nearly three years ago, Silicon Valley has spent heavily pursuing AI\u2019s holy grail: artificial general intelligence that matches or beats human thinking. Enthusiasts say it will give the U.S. military advantages, help cure cancer and solve climate change, and eliminate the need for people to perform routine work such as accounting and customer service.",
