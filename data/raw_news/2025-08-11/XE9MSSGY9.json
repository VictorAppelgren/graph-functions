  "description": "The official confirmation that the hip-hop icon will provide the halftime entertainment at the biggest game of the year wasn't warmly greeted by all footy fans.",
  "content": "The AFL has been accused of abandoning its platform of respecting women by hiring Snoop Dogg to play at this year's grand final, with a top radio star blasting the league for choosing the 'sexist' hip-hop icon.\n\nNews of the rapper's gig providing halftime entertainment had only just broken on Tuesday when 3AW's Tom Elliott slammed CEO Andrew Dillon for green-lighting the performance.\n\n'Snoop Dogg? I cannot stand hip-hop, rap, drill rap - any of the variations of talking not singing,' Elliott told his listeners.\n\n'There is no way ... that I am going to pay attention to what he has to say.\n\n'Snoop Dogg's lyrics - and we have been going through some of his songs this morning - are the absolute opposite of what the AFL is on about.\n\n'For example, this coming Thursday, the AFLW season starts ... the AFLW stands for diversity and inclusion.\n\n'They've got two weeks of pride rounds in the men's game. We respect people of different races and cultures and ethnicities.'\n\nElliott then read out the lyrics to the Snoop Dogg song Girls, Girls, Girls.\n\n'I like tall ones, white ones, fat ones, black ones, short ones, cute ones, bad ones, good ones.\n\n'I'm tryin' a creep with 'em, individually want to sleep with 'em, I do 'em, I did 'em, I hit 'em and quit 'em.\n\n'That's how I get rid of 'em, welcome to my world, girls, girls, girls.'\n\nHe then summed up the lyrics with, 'So basically it's OK to hit women and then get rid of them.\n\n'This is at odds with what the AFL is constantly lecturing us about - you know, respect towards women.\n\n'I can tell you, in the hip-hop culture they have anything but respect towards women. Women are objects to be used and abused and chucked away in the world of Snoop Dogg.\n\n'How the AFL thought this was a good idea I just don't know.'\n\nElliott predicted Snoop Dogg would try to 'censor' some of his extreme lyrics at the grand final, and pointed out that any AFL star who said he liked to hit his girlfriend and dump her would be in huge trouble.\n\nSome footy fans voiced the same opinion when the AFL broke the news of Snoop's performance on social media.\n\n'If the AFL didn't have double standards, they'd have no standards at all,' one wrote.\n\n'Like Snoop but I don't think he's suitable for grand final entertainment,' another commented.\n\nA third posted a list of Snoop tracks including 'I Wanna F**k You', 'B**ch Please' and 'B**ch Please II', along with the comment, 'Something tells me the Chardonnay is gonna hit the MCC [Melbourne Cricket Club] ceiling when Snoop starts unloading his playlist.'\n\nChannel Nine star Eddie McGuire claimed the musician's gig at the MCG caused drama for the AFL in a very different way thanks to footy great Dustin Martin's manager Ralph Carr.\n\nMcGuire accused Carr of infuriating the league by announcing the bombshell news on LinkedIn 12 days ago with the words, 'Representing Snoop Dogg for his visit to Australia' before quickly deleting the post.\n\n'Ralph Carr sent it out to everybody in the known universe,' McGuire said on his podcast with footy great Jimmy Bartel.\n\n'He had his nose severely pulled by the AFL, saying, \"Our announcement, d**khead, not yours\".'",
