  "description": "Today, the program provides benefits to almost 69 million Americans each month.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 90 years ago this week, he said it would provide economic stability to older people while giving the U.S. \"an economic structure of vastly greater soundness.\u201d\n\nToday, the program provides benefits to almost 69 million Americans each month. It's a major source of income for people older than 65 and is popular across the country and political lines.\n\nIt also looks more threatened than ever.\n\nJust as it has for decades, Social Security faces a looming shortfall in money to pay full benefits. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the program has faced more tumult. Agency staffing has been slashed. Unions and advocacy groups concerned about sharing sensitive information have sued. Administration officials, including the president, have falsely claimed that millions of dead people were receiving Social Security benefits. Former top adviser Elon Musk said the program was a potential \u201cPonzi scheme.\"\n\nAt an Oval Office event Thursday commemorating the program\u2019s anniversary, Trump said that under his watch \"we\u2019re strengthening it.\u201d But the president and Republicans who control Congress have not proposed a long-term solution to shore up the program.\n\nSocial Security remains far from the sound economic system that Roosevelt envisioned, due to changes made \u2013 and not made \u2013 under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at past and current challenges to Social Security, the proposed solutions and what it could take to shore up the program.\n\nThe go-broke date has been moved up\n\nThe so-called go-broke date \u2013 or the date at which Social Security will no longer have enough funds to pay full benefits \u2013 has been moved up to 2034, instead of last year\u2019s estimate of 2035. After that point, Social Security would only be able to pay 81% of benefits, according to an annual report released in June. The earlier date came as new legislation affecting Social Security benefits have contributed to earlier projected depletion dates, the report concluded.\n\nThe Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law by Democratic President Joe Biden and enacted in January, had an impact. It repealed the Windfall Elimination and Government Pension Offset provisions, increasing Social Security benefit levels for former public workers.\n\nThe new tax law signed by Trump in July will accelerate the insolvency of Social Security, said Brendan Duke at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t laid out an idea to fix it yet,\" he said. Trump on Thursday repeated the claim that his new tax and spending law will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits.\n\nThat law has a temporary tax deduction for people 65 and over that applies to all income, not just Social Security. But not all Social Security beneficiaries can claim it; among those who cannot are low-income older adults who do not pay taxes on Social Security.\n\nAARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said the number of beneficiaries is set to increase to 82 million people by the time Social Security turns 100.\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead to the next 90 years of Social Security, it\u2019s critical that it remains strong for generations to come,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe privatization conversation has been revived\n\nThe notion of privatizing Social Security surfaced most recently when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this month said new tax-deferred investment accounts dubbed \u201c Trump accounts\u201c may serve as a \u201cbackdoor to privatization,\" though Treasury has walked back those comments.\n\nThe public has been widely against the idea of privatizing Social Security since Republican President George W. Bush embarked on a campaign to pitch privatization of the program in 2005, through voluntary personal retirement accounts. The plan was not well-received by the public.\n\nGlenn Hubbard, a Columbia University professor and top economist in Bush\u2019s White House, told The Associated Press that Social Security needs to be reduced in size in order to maintain benefits for generations to come. He supports limiting benefits for wealthy retirees.\n\n\u201cWe will have to make a choice,\" Hubbard said. \u201cIf you want Social Security benefits to look like they are today, we\u2019re going to have to raise everyone\u2019s taxes a lot. And if that\u2019s what people want, that\u2019s a menu, and you pay the high price and you move on.\"\n\nAnother option would be to increase minimum benefits and slow down benefit growth for everyone else, which Hubbard said would right the ship without requiring big tax increases, if it's done over time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a political choice,\u201d he said, adding \u201cNeither one of those is pain free.\"\n\nNancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the preservation of Social Security benefits, is more worried that the administration of benefits could be privatized under Trump, rather than a move toward privatized accounts. The agency cut more than 7,000 from its workforce this year as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's effort to reduce the size of the government.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in April found that an increasing share of older Americans \u2013 particularly Democrats \u2013 support the program but aren\u2019t confident the benefit will be available to them when they retire.\n\n\u201cSo much of what we hear is that its running out of money,\u201d said Becky Boober, 70, from Rockport, Maine, who recently retired after decades in public service. She relies on Social Security to keep her finances afloat, is grateful for the program and thinks it should be expanded.\n\n\u201cIn my mind there are several easy fixes that are not a political stretch,\u201d she said. They include raising the income tax cap on high-income earners and possibly raising the retirement age, which is currently 67 for people born after 1960, though she is less inclined to support that change.\n\nSome call for shrinking the program\n\nRachel Greszler is a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the group behind the Project 2025 blueprint for Trump\u2019s second term. It called for an increase in the retirement age.\n\nGreszler says Social Security no longer serves its intended purpose of being a social safety net for low-income older adults and is far too large. She supports pursuing privatization, which includes allowing retirees to put their Social Security taxes into a personal investment account.\n\nShe also argues for shrinking the program to a point where every retiree would receive the same Social Security benefit so long as they worked the same number of years, which she argues would increase benefits for the bottom one-third of earners. How this would impact middle-class earners is unclear.",

      "text": "York City is off Trump administration's so-called 'sanctuary' list\nYork City is not considered a \"sanctuary\" in the eyes of the federal government, according to a list published by the Justice Department online Tuesday. That's despite appearing on the list's first rendition in May.\nYork City Mayor Michael Helfrich said Wednesday he had seen the list and was aware the city is not on it. He declined to comment further.\nThe Justice Department identified some three dozen states, cities and counties as so-called sanctuary jurisdictions on Tuesday, two months after the federal government quietly removed a much longer list that included many localities that support the Trump administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies.\nThe earlier, typo-riddled list was met with pushback from across the political spectrum, with officials often saying it wasn't clear why their jurisdictions were included.\nHelfrich and other city leaders have in the past denied that the city fits a \"sanctuary\" label.\nSanctuary: There is no strict definition for what constitutes a sanctuary policy or a sanctuary city. The terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding people until federal officers take custody.\nThen-Mayor C. Kim Bracey signed an executive order in 2017 outlining protections for immigrants while taking care to declare York as a \"welcoming city\" rather than give it a \"sanctuary city\" label. The order instructed city workers not to ask about one's immigration status unless required by law.\nWhen proposed legislation dubbed the \"Trust Act\" was discussed by York City Council over the winter, Council President Edquina Washington also affirmed the city as \"welcoming\" and not a \"sanctuary.\"\nThe legislation, which would have enshrined Bracey's protections for immigrants into law, narrowly passed the council but was vetoed by Helfrich. He repeatedly cited concerns that the legislation could cause the city to be misinterpreted as a \"sanctuary city,\" and therefore put millions of dollars in federal funding at risk.\nIn the earlier list from the Trump administration, York City was one of only five municipalities to receive the designation in Pennsylvania, alongside Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, State College and Gettysburg, along with 11 counties, including Adams and Dauphin.\nOf those, Philadelphia is the only Pennsylvania jurisdiction to appear in the re-released version.\n>>Want to stay up to date on the latest news? Sign up for the Dispatch newsletters.\nLatest from administration: The new announcement doesn't appear to threaten consequences beyond what the federal government is already doing.\nU.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi warned in the announcement that the department would \u201ccontinue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.\u201d\n\u201cSanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,\u201d she said.\nThe new list is composed overwhelmingly of Democratic jurisdictions, including states like New York, California and Connecticut, cities like Boston and New York City and a handful of counties, including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois.\nThe administration never fully explained the errors in the first announcement, which included hundreds of jurisdictions, including places that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump and at least one that had declared itself a \u201cnon-sanctuary city.\u201d The list was published in late May on the Department of Homeland Security's website but within three days was replaced with a \u201cPage Not Found\u201d error message.\nImmigration enforcement: Trump officials have long warned that the federal government would go after jurisdictions that resist the president's plans for mass deportations. In April, Trump signed an executive order requiring Homeland Security and the attorney general to publish a list of jurisdictions they believe are obstructing federal immigration laws.\nThe administration has filed a series of lawsuits targeting state or city policies it says are interfering with immigration enforcement, including those in Los Angeles, New York City, Denver and Rochester, New York. It sued four New Jersey cities in May.\nIn late July, a judge in Illinois dismissed a Trump administration lawsuit that sought to disrupt limits Chicago imposes on cooperation between federal immigration agents and local police.\nIn Connecticut, Democratic officials pushed back, arguing there\u2019s no reference to sanctuary jurisdictions in state law.\nAttorney General William Tong called the description of sanctuary states in the Department of Justice announcement \u201ca concocted fiction\u201d of the Trump administration.\nConnecticut\u2019s Trust Act law has limited how police in the state can work with federal immigration since 2013.\n\u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report\n>> Please consider subscribing to support local journalism."

      "text": "Trump says he's placing D.C. police under federal control, deploying the National Guard\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington including deployment of the National Guard, prompting the city's mayor to voice legal concerns about who would be patrolling the streets in the nation's capital.\nTrump said at a Monday news briefing that he was \u201cdeploying the National Guard to help reestablish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they\u2019re going to be allowed to do their job properly.\u201d\nThe Republican president compared crime in the American capital with that in other major cities, saying Washington performs poorly on safety relative to the capitals of Iraq, Brazil and Colombia, among others.\n\u201cWe're getting rid of the slums, too,\u201d Trump said, adding that the U.S. would not lose its cities and that Washington was just a start.\nFor Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move involves at least 500 federal law enforcement officials, raising fundamental questions about how an increasingly emboldened federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts.\nCombating crime\nThe president has used his social media and White House megaphones to message that his administration is tough on crime, yet his ability to shape policy might be limited outside of Washington, which has a unique status as a congressionally established federal district. Nor is it clear how his push would address the root causes of homelessness and crime.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation\u2019s capital as part of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.\nMore than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Marshals Service are also contributing officers.\nThe person was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately have a comment Monday morning.\nTrump says he signed documents to give himself authority to crack down on crime in Washington\nThe president said he signed an executive order and presidential memorandum in the Oval Office before holding his news conference.\nOne executive order invoked presidential powers under the Home Rule Act to take over Washington\u2019s police force.\nHe also signed what the administration called statutorily required notification letters to DC Mayor Bowser and relevant congressional leaders.\nTrump also signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy the National Guard in the nation\u2019s capital.\nFocusing on homelessness\nTrump in a Sunday social media post had emphasized the removal of Washington's homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\nLast week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option \u201cto extend as needed.\u201d\nOn Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service assigned more than 120 officers and agents to assist in Washington.\nTrump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was \u201cridiculous\u201d and the city was \u201cunsafe,\u201d after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe National Guard\nMayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.\nBowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC's \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \"the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d\nBowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. She noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as \u201cone of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.\"\nFor Bowser, \u201cAny comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.\u201d\nCrime statistics\nPolice statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nTrump offered no details in Truth Social posts over the weekend about possible new actions to address crime levels he argues are dangerous for citizens, tourists and workers alike. The White House declined to offer additional details about Monday's announcement.\nThe police department and the mayor\u2019s office did not respond to questions about what Trump might do next.\nThe president criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.\n\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nHe called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining. It could face steep pushback.\nBowser acknowledged that the law allows the president to take more control over the city's police, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\" she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d"

      "text": "US July budget deficit up 20% year-over-year despite record Trump tariff income\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.\nThe U.S. saw a 273% increase \u2014 or $21 billion \u2014 in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed.\nA Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government\u2019s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.\nEven as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.\nIf tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.\nWhile organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue \u2014 estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump\u2019s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result \u201c in only modest reductions in federal debt.\u201d\nIn June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court.\nA Treasury official did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on when the U.S. could begin to see tariff revenue start to put a dent in the deficit.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month on Fox Business Network's \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d that the administration is \u201claser-focused on bringing this deficit down.\u201d The Trump administration expects to make more trade deals with other nations, including China and other major economies.\nFor instance, on Monday, Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days, which preserves the 30% tariffs he had imposed as a condition for negotiations. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\nTrump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that \u201call other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.\u201d Beijing, at the same time, also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce.\n>> Please consider subscribing to support local journalism.\nWant to stay up to date on the latest news?
