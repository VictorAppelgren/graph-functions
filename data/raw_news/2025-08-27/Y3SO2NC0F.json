  "description": "The couple\u2019s 49-year-old age gap has raised eyebrows. Now, it might raise money.",
  "content": "Jordon Hudson wants to make some gold from the gold-digging accusations levied at her amid her relationship with Bill Belichick, who is estimated to be worth $70 million.\n\nThe former cheerleader, 24, filed a trademark application this week through the company she manages, TCE Rights Management, to cash in on her \u201cgold digger\u201d epithet.\n\nMany have been quick to ridicule Hudson\u2019s 49-year age gap with the eight-time Super Bowl champion coach, 73, since they started dating in 2023.\n\nHowever, the couple has largely disregarded criticism and has cheekily made light of the situation.\n\nYet, Hudson and Belichick are suspiciously touchy about how they began their romance. During an April interview on CBS News\u2019 Sunday Morning, Hudson immediately shut down a question directed at Belichick about how they met, a moment that later went viral. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this,\u201d she sternly interjected. The incident sparked fan speculation about the nature of Hudson\u2019s relationship with Belichick.\n\nThe controversy was further fueled by the North Carolina Tar Heels head coach\u2019s request in March that Hudson be copied on all of his work emails.\n\nBelichick\u2019s friends and family also seem to find their \u201cgold digger\u201d relationship no laughing matter, and reportedly kicked Hudson out of a Christmas party. Belichick\u2019s former girlfriend of 16 years, Linda Holliday, 62, was also in attendance.\n\nOthers in Belichick\u2019s circle are angered simply by the sheer amount of attention his dating life has garnered.\n\n\u201cWe talking more about Jordon Hudson than talking about who\u2019s our starting quarterback. You can\u2019t name me three players on North Carolina\u2019s roster right now besides Jordon Hudson,\u201d said former NFL quarterback Cam Newton.",

      "text": "What is Bill Belichick's Net Worth and Salary?\nBill Belichick is an American football head coach who has a net worth of $70 million. Bill Belichick is considered one of the best coaches in NFL history, showing an early aptitude for the game of football, a trait he no doubt inherited from his father, a longtime assistant coach and college football scout. Belichick got his start in 1975 when he took a job with the Baltimore Colts. By the 1980s, he was the defensive coordinator for the New York Giants and was touted as one of the brightest minds in the game. After a rocky stint as head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the early 1990s, the New England Patriots hired Bill in 2000. In the ensuing years, Bill guided the franchise to eight Super Bowl victories.\nPatriots Contract and Salary\nThe details of Bill's contract are not public but several inside reports have claimed he is quietly the highest-paid coach in the NFL. The largest known contract is Jon Gruden's 10-year $100 million deal signed in 2019 that comes with an annual salary of $10 million before bonuses. It is generally understood that Belichick earns at least $12.5 million in base salary. Some estimates have claimed his salary is actually as high as $25 million. His last known contract was an extension signed in 2007 that kept him with the Patriots through 2013. It is also known that he signed an extension sometime before 2013.\nUNC Contract and Salary\nIn December 2024, Bill signed a 5-year, $50 million contract to become the head coach of the University of North Carolina. The deal pays an average of $10 million per year and includes a clause that would allow him to get out of the deal at any point if he wanted to take an NFL coaching job.\nEarly Life\nBill Belichick was born William Stephen Belichick on April 16, 1952, in Nashville, Tennessee. He grew up in Annapolis, Maryland, with his mother Jeannette and father Steve, who worked as an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy; Bill's godfather is Bill Edwards, a College Football Hall of Fame coach. Belichick studied the way his father dissected game film, drew up plays, and often accompanied Steve to coaches' meetings. By his early teens, Bill was a regular part of the team's practices and was well-versed in the game's schemes and formations. Belichick attended Annapolis High School, where he was a member of the football and lacrosse teams. He graduated in 1970, then attended Massachusetts' Phillips Academy for a postgraduate year, improving his test scores and grades enough to get into Wesleyan University. At Wesleyan, Bill played tight end and center on the football team and was the captain of the lacrosse team; he also played squash and joined the Chi Psi fraternity. In 1975, Belichick graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics.\nNFL Coaching Career\nAfter graduating from Wesleyan, Belichick took a job with the Baltimore Colts for $25 a week, serving as an assistant to head coach Ted Marchibroda. In 1976, he became the assistant special teams coach for the Detroit Lions, and the following year, he began coaching wide receivers and tight ends. In 1978, Bill began working for the Denver Broncos as a defensive assistant and assistant special teams coach. In 1979, he held those same positions with the New York Giants, and he began coaching linebackers in 1980. In 1985, Belichick became the Giants' defensive coordinator, and the team won the Super Bowl in 1987 and 1991; Bill's Super Bowl XXV defensive game plan earned a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Belichick joined the Cleveland Browns as head coach in 1991 and stayed with the team until 1995; when it was announced that the team would move to Baltimore, Bill was assured that he would be coaching the new team, but he was fired instead.\nIn 1996, Belichick was hired by the New England Patriots as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach, and in 1997, he joined the New York Jets as interim head coach, then became assistant head coach and defensive coordinator after Bill Parcells was named head coach. Parcells had arranged to have Belichick take over in 1999, but the day after he was announced as head coach, Bill resigned during a press conference. He became head coach for the New England Patriots in 2000 and took on general manager duties as well. In 2007, Bill was fined $500,000 after a Patriots video assistant was caught filming the New York Jets' defensive signals in what is known as \"Spygate.\" The team was also fined $250,000, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell took away the Patriots' first-round draft pick in the following year's NFL Draft.

Several of Belichick\u2019s former colleagues and friends have spoken out about his relationship with Hudson in recent weeks. The couple have been at the epicenter of controversy following a viral, tense CBS interview that saw Hudson, who is also Belichick\u2019s public relations representative, bar a reporter from asking the two how they met. The coach told ESPN earlier this week that Hudson \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything to do with UNC football.\u201d\nRead it at People"
