  "title": "Deal: The Yaber L2s Projector is just $134.98, and it's actually quite enjoyable!",
  "description": "You can take a Yaber L2s Projector home for just under $135! It's not a bad option, either. You'd be surprised how good it is for this price.",
  "content": "Projectors are kind of magical. Nothing quite beats enjoying a weekend movie, cozied up in your favorite blankie, in a dark room, with a projector playing a movie on your wall. The thing is, projectors were usually very expensive, but things are changing, and now you can get something like the Yaber L2s projector, which will look great and is only going for $134.98 right now! Buy the Yaber L2s Projector for just $134.98 ($65.01 off)\n\nThis offer is available from Amazon, but the official seller is Woot. That said, Woot is a deals-focused website owned by Amazon, so you\u2019re buying from a reputable source. Additionally, you get a 30-day return window, and the product is in new condition. Also, only the Misty White version is on sale. The Charcoal White model is going for $259.99.\n\nIf you walk inside my pad, you won\u2019t find a TV anywhere. Truth is, I don\u2019t have much time to enjoy one, so I own a projector, which I store away and only bring out when I can enjoy a good film. I have also taken it with me to other people\u2019s houses. Modern projectors are affordable, convenient, and look pretty good. This is why we can recommend something like the Yaber L2s to most people, and it costs a mere $134.98 right now!\n\nOur co-workers at SoundGuys.com have reviewed the Yaber L2s Projector, and while it isn\u2019t as impressive as more expensive models, they were quite happy with the value.\n\nThe clean, simple, and compact design makes it very portable. However, it does not have a battery, so you\u2019ll need to plug it in to use it. This is why we don\u2019t truly consider it a portable projector. It\u2019s easy to carry if you want to use it at a friend\u2019s house, though. The projector is simple and user-friendly, though. You won\u2019t really need to worry much about maintenance, and operating it is straightforward.\n\nIn terms of specs, we\u2019re looking at a pretty nice Full HD resolution with a 700-lumen brightness. Based on our experience, it is great for dark rooms, but things start getting a bit less visible once the environment gets a bit brighter. The image can be expanded up to a whopping 150 inches, turning any wall into a fun little movie theater.\n\nConsidering the price and size, we were actually quite surprised by the audio quality. The couple of 8W JBL-powered speakers sound pretty good, and they get loud. Of course, they are still not as good as a good dedicated speaker, but it should be more than enough to enjoy a movie in your living room.\n\nIf we had to complain about anything, it would be that it comes with no integrated smart TV OS. It\u2019s to be expected when a projector is this good and cheap, though. You can definitely get a smart TV dongle or box and plug it into the HDMI port.\n\nHonestly, you shouldn\u2019t consider any other options if you want to pay this little for a projector. It\u2019s kind of too good for the cost, especially at this discounted price. Go get it while you can!",

      "text": "All products featured are independently chosen by us. However, SoundGuys may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links. See our ethics statement.\nYaber Projector L2s Review\nJanuary 28, 2025\nYaber Projector L2s\nYaber\u2019s latest addition to its Home Cinema lineup, the L2s, aims to deliver an easy and affordable way to bring big-screen entertainment into your home. With its promise of simplicity and some key features that stand out in its class, it\u2019s an intriguing option for people wanting to get into the home theater game. In this SoundGuys review, we\u2019ll unpack the L2s to help you decide if it deserves a spot in your home entertainment setup.\nThis article was published on January 28, 2025, and is the first version of this article. Updates will follow as the market changes.\nWhat I like about the Yaber Projector L2s\nThe design of the Yaber Projector L2s is pretty lightweight and a good size for most living rooms. The all-plastic build is typical for most projectors of this price and is easy to install into any home theater setup.\nThe projector gives you the option to either plop it onto a table, nightstand, shelf or whatever surface you have, and you can adjust the tilt using a screw leg in the front\u2014or you can ceiling mount it using the 1/4\u2033-20 screw thread underneath the projector. In terms of mounting the projector, though it is nice that they included a pretty standard 1/4\u2033-20 screw thread underneath the projector, there\u2019s unfortunately only one mounting point which doesn\u2019t give me a ton of confidence, and I would\u2019ve liked to see a few more screw holes for mounting more securely.\nThe projector has a slot where you can clean its dust filter, as well as an accessible backdoor to wipe the inside projection elements for further maintenance, which is nice.\nThe power button is the only button on the projector itself. The rest of the controls are accessed via the included remote, which resembles any other remote for a smart TV or something similar. Each button is tactile and relatively responsive. There\u2019s a dedicated button for triggering the auto-focus and auto keystoning as well as manually adjusting your focus forward and backwards.\nThe name of the game for this product as a whole is in its simplicity.\nThere is no app for the projector, but that\u2019s uncommon anyway since all of the settings can be configured within the projector\u2019s menus. The menus are simple, with adjustments to change Image Modes (basically the projection picture profiles), turning the autofocus on/off, automatic (vertical) keystoning or manual keystoning, and screen scaling, which are all easy to control and comprehensive.\nWhat\u2019s great about this projector is that it does offer a handful of connectivity options, albeit not a lot of I/O on the physical projector itself, but lots of wireless options. In terms of wired connections, the projector has one HDMI port on the back, as well as a USB type A port, which allows you to connect USB memory to play media or to use it for wired casting from a phone. The projector also has a 3.5mm output for wired listening via headphones or external speakers.\nAs for wireless connectivity, you can cast via iOS or Android devices, and you can even connect Bluetooth speakers to the projector over Bluetooth 5.0. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t have Bluetooth speakers but just want to listen to music, you can also use the projector\u2019s built-in speakers as a Bluetooth speaker.\nUnlike Yaber\u2019s Anywhere Cinema lineup of projectors, the Yaber L2s does not have an internal battery. It is AC-powered only as it is part of its Home Cinema line of products. If you want a portable projector to take with you on the go, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.\nThe sound quality of the stereo 8W speakers provided by JBL is surprisingly decent, especially when considering most built-in projector speakers are either terrible or not worth having at all. It\u2019s capable of getting pretty quiet for when you want to watch a movie late at night without bothering your neighbors, to pretty loud for its size. When using the speakers in a small-to-medium-sized room, I found the speakers good enough to stay immersed in the content I was watching.\nThe speakers are able to produce pretty decently clear mid-range frequencies, which was an immediate stand-out.\nFor example, the horns and brass section in Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s soundtrack \u201cCan You Hear the Music\u201d from Christopher Nolan\u2019s film Oppenheimer comes through clearly with brilliance. That being said, the lower synths are missing the bass strength and presence to really bring that piece home, but the overall clarity is impressive for these tiny speakers inside the projector.\nWhat I don\u2019t like about the Yaber Projector L2s\nWhen buying a home theater projector solution, one of the main things to consider is image quality and performance. The Yaber L2s fares okay, but it\u2019s nothing to write home about. The image out of the box is desaturated, with low contrast, and overall the colors appear cooler. Our testing of the projector\u2019s color accuracy in the Standard Image Mode revealed a measured color temperature of 8290K, highlighting this issue. Typically, most projectors should be projecting at 6500k.\nAdditionally, in terms of color accuracy, don\u2019t expect to experience what any filmmakers or content creators intended for how the image should look out of this projector. Color accuracy is measured in dE which is a standard measurement that quantifies the difference between two colors that appear on a projection or screen. The scale of measurement ranges from 0 to 100, 0 having the least color difference, and 100 having the most color difference. The Yaber Pro L2s scored a \u0394E (Delta E, or dE) value of 14.47 (dE value of lower than 2 is ideal). For dE values from 10-20, the colors are very noticeably different, like comparing distinct shades that no longer feel similar.\nIn our testing, we found that the projector was able to cover 51.0% of the sRGB color gamut, whereas it can only cover 35.2% AdobeRGB, and 36.2% of the DCI-P3 color space. You can see our test results below.\nWhat\u2019s also unfortunate is that the advertised ANSI Lumens that Yaber boasted for this projector was 700 ANSI Lumens, but in our measurements, it came out to 328 ANSI Lumens. This means that to get the best performance out of this projector, you\u2019d have to black out your room to make sure no ambient lighting won\u2019t cast onto your projector screen or wall that you\u2019re projecting onto. If there\u2019s even a bit of ambient lighting in the room, the entire image will become harder to see and the contrast ratio will also worsen. Ambient lighting control is important for most of any projectors of course, but for the Yaber L2s, unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to use this in a living room with big windows during broad daylight, for example.\nThough simple, I do wish the projector gave you more fine-tuned adjustability within the Image Modes to tailor the best color out of the projector since, out of the box, the Standard Image Mode is poor and not very vibrant, contrasty, or saturated as it should be. Below is my personal recommendation to use with the \u201cUser\u201d defined Image Mode after futzing with the settings for a while to get it closer to what the image should look like:\n- Brightness: 49\n- Contrast: 53\n- Saturation: 73\n- Sharpness: 0\n- Hue: 50\n- Temperature: Standard\nAnd, of course, with our bread and butter being sound, we couldn\u2019t ignore some of the downsides of the sound quality of this little home theater machine. Even though the dual 8W JBL Sound speakers don\u2019t sound awful, due to the projector\u2019s size, it\u2019s just not capable of producing any meaningful bass, and definitely no sub-bass whatsoever. At higher volumes, the mids become a bit muddied and unclear, while the higher frequencies can distort a bit. That being said, if you don\u2019t have a home theater speaker system already for casual moviegoers and content-watching, these speakers will do just fine for most people.\nFor example, in Hans Zimmer\u2019s soundtrack \u201cNo Time for Caution\u201d from Christopher Nolan\u2019s film Interstellar, the bass depth of the organ is basically non-existent, and the presence of the piece feels lacklustre. Although bringing up the volume does fill the room, when all of the orchestral instruments, including the organ, crescendo to the main climax of the piece, the string section especially gets distorted, making the mid-register instruments like cellos and piano harder to make out individually.\nI would highly recommend pairing this lil\u2019 projector with an actual speaker system to really get the best immersive experience out of it. It\u2019s nice that the projector also gives you the option to use the device itself as a Bluetooth speaker, but the sound quality alone is not as impressive as something you can achieve out of some great Bluetooth speakers that cost a fraction of the cost of the projector. Unfortunately, when using a Bluetooth speaker, there is a noticeable delay to the audio, which can be distracting when watching content. If you are to pair it with a Bluetooth speaker, you can consider Bose SoundLink Flex Gen 2 ($149 at Amazon), or if you want to invest in something a little nicer, the Soundcore Motion X600 ($149.99 at Amazon) would be great.\nYaber Projector L2s Specs\n| Yaber Projector L2s | ||\n|---|---|---|\n| Yaber Projector L2s Display | Brightness Native Resolution Compatible Resolution Video Format | 700 ANSI Lumens 1080P, 60Hz 1920 x 1080 3GP/ASF/AVI/FLV/MKV/MP4/MPG/RMVB/TS/VOB |\n| Yaber Projector L2s Projection | Projection size Focus Throw Ratio Keystone | 40-150\" Auto 1.38 :1 Auto |\n| Yaber Projector L2s Audio | Speaker Audio Format | L2s 8W JBL Speakers x2 AAC/FLAC/M4A/MP3/ WAV |\n| Yaber Projector L2s Connectivity | Bluetooth Ports Wi-Fi | Bluetooth 5.0 HDMI x1 / USB Type-A x1 / 3.5mm Audio Out x1 2.4G + 5G |\n| Yaber Projector L2s Measurements | Product Size Product Weight | 226.9 x 159 x 184mm 5.07lb (2.3kg) |\n| Yaber Projector L2s What's in the Box | L2 Projector Power Cord | Projector Remote Control HDMI Cable |\nShould you buy the Yaber Projector L2s?\nThe Yaber L2s is a solid budget projector for casual viewers looking to set up a simple home theater. It\u2019s easy to use, with a lightweight design, JBL speakers, and features like wireless casting and Bluetooth connectivity, making it great for family movie nights or binge-watching shows in a dark room. Between picture and sound for the price, this is something you should definitely consider getting\u2014even more so if you can find it on sale!\nThat said, it\u2019s not without its drawbacks. The projector\u2019s actual brightness falls short of its advertised claims, limiting its usability in rooms with any ambient light. Its color accuracy also leaves much to be desired, with muted tones and a cooler color temperature that won\u2019t satisfy those seeking lifelike images. While the built-in speakers are better than most projectors in this price range, they lack bass and the higher frequencies can distort at higher volumes, so pairing it with an external speaker system setup is recommended.\nIf you\u2019re a casual viewer on a budget, the Yaber L2s offers solid value, especially if you find it on sale. However, serious home theater enthusiasts or professionals who prioritize brightness, color accuracy, and sound quality should look elsewhere.\nYaber Projector L2s review: FAQs\nBecause the Yaber L2s's projection technology uses an LCD, often times with cheaper projectors of this class, this is the first to go. Burn-ins and other image issues may arise if used for prolonged periods of time.\nYou can connect your phone to the Yaber L2s projector via iOS or Android wireless casting. You can also connect your phone via wired casting via the USB Type-A port on the back of the projector. You can also connect your phone to the projector via Bluetooth for using the speaker as a Bluetooth speaker.\nThe Yaber L2s projector has Bluetooth 5.0.\nIn our testing, we had it turned on for over 5-6 hours with no issues, but with more time there may be more risk of the LCD in the projector burning out sooner.\nIf you can afford it, definitely go for a projector screen to get the most out of the projector's capabilities. Depending on the wall material and paint, your performance can drastically vary, though this doesn't mean you can't use it on a wall!\nTypically, a grey projector screen offers better perceived contrast ratio in rooms that have more ambient lighting, whereas a white projector screen will offer more brightness and color vibrancy in a more light-controlled room.\nThe closer the project is to your projector screen, the brighter your projection will be, but of course, this comes at the cost of your screen size. If you want a larger-than-TV-sized image, then you can project from 40\" up to a 150\" projection size with the Yaber L2s projector.\nUnfortunately, we do not recommend using the Yaber L2s projector in daylight conditions as the overall light output of the projector wouldn't be able to compete with the brightness of the sun.\nThe Yaber L2s projector doesn't natively support Netflix or have an app for it, but you can connect your computer via HDMI or your phone via wired or wireless casting to open Netflix that way instead.\nThe Yaber L2s projector supports AAC, FLAC, M4A, MP3, and WAV audio formats.\nThe Yaber L2s projector supports 3GP, ASF, AVI, FLV, MKV, MP4, MPG, RMVB, TS, and VOB video formats.\nThank you for being part of our community.

  "argos_summary": "The Yaber L2s projector is currently on sale for $134.98, making it an affordable option for casual movie watchers. It features Full HD resolution, 700-lumen brightness, and JBL-powered speakers, although its actual brightness is lower than advertised, limiting use in well-lit rooms. While the projector is user-friendly and portable, it lacks integrated smart features and has some color accuracy issues, making it best suited for those on a budget rather than serious home theater enthusiasts.",
