  "description": "A big unknown with President Donald Trump\u2019s move Monday to federalize the DC Metropolitan Police and deploy the National Guard in the nation\u2019s capital is how much he wants a crackdown versus the appearance of one.",
  "content": "A big unknown with President Donald Trump\u2019s move Monday to federalize the DC Metropolitan Police Department and deploy the National Guard in the nation\u2019s capital is how much he wants a crackdown versus the appearance of one.\n\nTrump\u2019s mobilization of the military two months ago in Los Angeles seemed to fit the latter category. Maybe Trump just wants to look like he\u2019s getting tough on crime in DC.\n\nBut with Trump\u2019s now-repeated and historically extraordinary deployment of the Guard \u2013 and his comments about bringing this approach to other cities \u2013 he\u2019s doing what he often does: gradually pushing the envelope and getting ever closer to what seems to be his desired outcome, which is a fuller militarization of the homeland.\n\nThat might sound overwrought to some. But it\u2019s worth emphasizing that this is precisely the outcome that multiple top generals and military officials who served in Trump\u2019s first term worried about \u2013 and warned about.\n\nFor years, they\u2019ve cast Trump\u2019s desire to dispatch the military on US soil as one of his most troubling tendencies \u2013 and even case-in-point evidence of his authoritarianism.\n\nThis issue was raised in one form or another by two Trump defense secretaries (Jim Mattis and Mark Esper), his top general (Mark Milley) and his chief of staff (John Kelly, also a retired general). All of them have cast this as a line that is not to be crossed and indicated they feared Trump would indeed cross it. Some even recalled multiple instances when Trump tried to do so or suggested it.\n\nThe flashpoint for many of their comments was the scene in June 2020 when federal law enforcement cleared Lafayette Square near the White Houe of racial-justice protesters. They did so right before Trump strolled through for a photo-op featuring both Milley and Esper. (Both later expressed regret for participating.)\n\nMattis responded with a blistering \u2013 and unusual, for him \u2013 statement that warned of what the scene portended.\n\n\u201cMilitarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, DC, sets up a conflict \u2014 a false conflict \u2014 between the military and civilian society,\u201d he said. \u201cIt erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part.\u201d\n\nMattis said the military should be used on US soil \u201conly when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors.\u201d\n\nEsper has described a scene in which Trump asked him and Milley why the protesters couldn\u2019t simply be shot \u201cin the legs or something.\u201d And in his 2022 book, he said a large part of his job that summer was \u201cmaking sure to blunt or redirect any efforts that could politicize the military, misuse the force, or undermine the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nIn a CNN interview in October, Esper even invoked the Kent State massacre, where the National Guard killed four Vietnam War protesters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to that,\u201d Esper said.\n\nKelly likewise has said Trump had to be told repeatedly why he shouldn\u2019t use the military against American citizens, dating back to his first year in office. But he said Trump would just keep pressing the issue.\n\n\u201cAnd I think this issue of using the military on \u2014 to go after \u2014 American citizens is one of those things I think is a very, very bad thing \u2014 even to say it for political purposes to get elected \u2014 I think it\u2019s a very, very bad thing, let alone actually doing it,\u201d Kelly told the New York Times last year.\n\nIn the same interview, Kelly mentioned Trump\u2019s penchant for this while saying he met the definition of a fascist.\n\nThat\u2019s a description Milley, too, has applied to Trump. And at one point, he reportedly so feared Trump\u2019s willingness to misuse the military that he worried Trump might launch a coup after the 2020 election. (Trump denied ever considering such a thing.)\n\nIn their 2021 book, \u201cI Alone Can Fix it,\u201d Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker reported that Milley believed Trump was stoking unrest with his false claims about voter fraud in possible hope of being able to call in the military. (Rucker is now senior vice president for editorial strategy and news at CNN.)\n\n\u201cThis is a Reichstag moment,\u201d Milley reportedly told aides, recalling the episode the Nazis used as a pretext to cripple the opposition and consolidate power.\n\nMilley didn\u2019t confirm the account in the book, but a defense official close to him suggested to CNN in 2021 that Milley was indeed quite concerned about Trump mobilizing the military for nefarious purposes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to sit in silence while people try to use the military against Americans,\u201d the official said.\n\nTrump\u2019s time in politics has featured no shortage of former administration officials who warn in pretty stark terms about his tendencies.\n\nBut what\u2019s particularly notable here is the positions these men held. These are precisely the kinds of people who would be most aware of Trump\u2019s desire to misuse the military.\n\nAnd the fact that they\u2019ve suggested he\u2019s pushed for these things privately indicates it isn\u2019t just bluster when Trump talks openly about calling in active duty military in addition to the National Guard in DC, as he did Monday.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean all of that will come to pass. The guardrails have held before, even as they\u2019ve clearly receded in his second term. And Trump\u2019s legal authorities are more limited outside DC.\n\nBut the president appears more and more intent on pressing the issue. And that makes the comments of these four men more relevant than ever.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump said Monday he is placing Washington, DC\u2019s, police department \u201cunder direct federal control\u201d and deploying National Guard troops to the nation\u2019s capital, citing a public safety emergency after an assault on a former government worker.\nThe move draws on the sweeping, but temporary powers granted under the Home Rule Act of 1973, a law that balances local self-governance with federal oversight in the capital. While the president can assume control of the police department for up to two days, extending this authority would require congressional notice or a change to the law.\nTrump\u2019s announcement comes after the assault of a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency worker during an attempted carjacking on August 3. While Trump has repeatedly criticized what he describes as a surge in violent crime in Washington, overall crime numbers this year are lower than last year.\n\u201cWashington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today!\u201d Trump said Monday on his Truth Social.\nThe declaration also came as administration lawyers were in a courtroom Monday for the first day of a trial over the legality of Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard in California in June amid protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles.\nHere\u2019s what to know about Trump\u2019s authority in Washington, DC, and the implications of this unprecedented move:\nHow was Trump able to take over DC\u2019s police?\nWashington, DC, operates under the Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants Congress oversight and authority over the capital while allowing district residents limited self-governance.\nThe act grants emergency powers to the federal government, allowing the president to take control of the city\u2019s police for up to 48 hours if he determines \u201cspecial conditions of an emergency nature exist,\u201d requiring the department\u2019s use for federal purposes.\nThis marks the first time in the act\u2019s history that a president has assumed control of the city\u2019s police force.\nExtending the takeover for a longer period requires Trump to formally notify the chairs and ranking members of congressional committees handling DC affairs.\nAny control lasting more than 30 days would need congressional approval and must be passed into law, a highly improbable scenario given the current gridlock in a closely divided Congress.\nWhat do district leaders say?\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser and leaders of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department did not know about Trump\u2019s intentions ahead of his announcement, three sources told CNN.\nBowser called the move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented\u201d during a news conference Monday, saying she believes Trump\u2019s view of DC was \u201cshaped by his Covid-era experience during his first term\u201d when crime spiked.\nDC Police Union chairman Greggory Pemberton said the group supports the move and agrees \u201csomething needs to be done.\u201d\nNational Guard and FBI agents already working with police\nTrump also activated 800 soldiers from the DC National Guard, with up to 200 assigned to support law enforcement, according to the Defense Department.\n\u201cDuties for those personnel include administrative and logistical roles, as well as providing a physical presence in support of law enforcement,\u201d the Defense Department said.\nBeyond the police department, Trump has broad jurisdiction over the city\u2019s affairs. Numerous federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, are headquartered in the city and report directly to the administration.\nOver the weekend, Trump moved officers from several federal agencies, including up to 130 FBI agents to patrol with DC police in several neighborhoods.\nCrime rates in DC on decline since last year\nDespite Trump\u2019s claims Monday that crime is \u201cout of control,\u201d data shows violent crime in Washington, DC, has been declining since its 2023 spike, with two years of sustained improvement.\nThere were 274 reported homicides in 2023, the city\u2019s highest number since 1997. But there was a 32% drop in 2024 to 187 and another 12% fall so far this year, with 99 reported as of Sunday.\nCarjackings saw a similar trend. After surging to 959 in 2023, the number of reported carjackings dropped to around 500 in 2024, and has fallen further in 2025, with just 188 incidents as of Saturday. July marked the lowest monthly carjacking total since May 2020.\nSimilarly, cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore and Detroit \u2013 historically known for high homicide rates \u2013 have seen substantial declines in violent crime in 2024, 2025 or both."

Just shoot them in the legs or something?\u201d Trump asked, according to an excerpt in Esper\u2019s book \u201cA Sacred Oath,\u201d Axios reported.\nA representative for Trump did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\nCNN has previously reported similar accounts, including those documented by journalist Michael Bender in his own book titled \u201cFrankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost.\u201d\nLast year, Bender\u2019s book revealed new details about how Trump repeatedly called for law enforcement to shoot protesters during Oval Office meetings.\n\u201cJust shoot them,\u201d Trump said on multiple occasions inside the Oval Office, according to Bender\u2019s book.\nWhen Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley and then-Attorney General Bill Barr would push back, Trump toned it down, but only slightly, Bender adds.\n\u201cWell, shoot them in the leg\u2014or maybe the foot,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut be hard on them!\u201d\nEarlier this month, CNN reported that the Justice Department reached an agreement to settle four lawsuits filed by protesters who were forcibly cleared out of Washington\u2019s Lafayette Square during a racial justice protest outside the White House in 2020.\nThe US Park Police and the US Secret Service have agreed to revise their policies toward demonstrations and crowd control, according to a settlement filed in DC\u2019s federal court."

      "text": "President Donald Trump is nothing if not skilled at crafting alternate realities and using them to benefit himself politically. But his messaging around the Los Angeles protests has taken it to another level.\nYou could be forgiven for thinking Trump wants to create the illusion of a federal crackdown on protesters without everything that comes with the real deal. That\u2019s not to say Trump is bluffing about a hands-on response \u2014 but there\u2019s also value in creating perceptions.\nTrump\u2019s decisions to send in the National Guard and mobilize the Marines are controversial for a whole host of reasons. But for now, the guard and the Marines aren\u2019t actually allowed to conduct law enforcement. The guard has had little engagement with protestors.\nUnless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, the guard is restricted to protecting federal property and personnel. That translates to mostly guarding an immigration detention center and possibly assisting the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that set off the protests. The Marines have done even less so far \u2013 the commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, said Tuesday that the Marines, while mobilized, haven\u2019t yet been called in to respond.\nAs CNN\u2019s Josh Campbell reports, the bulk of the 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines that have been mobilized actually remain out of public view and likely won\u2019t even be seen publicly. And CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky and Natasha Bertrand reported Tuesday that the Marines have not received official tasks or orders yet and many are undergoing additional training before they potentially assist with the protests, citing US officials.\nBut to hear Trump tell it, his decision to call in the troops has made all the difference in putting down violent demonstrations.\n\u201cWe made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in a social media post. \u201cIf we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated.\u201d\nHe added later: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t \u2018SEND IN THE TROOPS\u2019 to Los Angeles the last three nights, that once beautiful and great City would be burning to the ground right now.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s comments gloss over the fact that the protests and violence are actually confined to a small portion of Los Angeles, with the vast majority of the city and Los Angeles County going about its regular business.\nBut they also imply a much bigger role for the troops than we\u2019ve actually seen.\nTrump made similar comments at a White House event later in the day.\nHe said \u201cwe ended\u201d the violence, and: \u201cLos Angeles was under siege until we got there. The police were unable to handle it.\u201d\n\u201cLast night, they had total control,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the military in there, the National Guard \u2013 and then we also sent in some Marines,\u201d he added before trailing off.\nTrump made similar comments on Monday, saying the guard had arrived \u201cjust in time.\u201d\nTalking about possibly sending in the Marines, Trump said, \u201cI mean, I think we have it very well under control. I think it would have been a very bad situation.\u201d Shortly after, despite those comments, the Pentagon went on to mobilize 2,000 more National Guard troops and the 700 Marines who are standing by.\nThe increased military presence could be acting as a deterrent to some violence. CNN\u2019s Kyung Lah, who is on the ground in Los Angeles covering the protests, told me the guard\u2019s biggest impact is as a \u201cshow of force\u201d and a target for people\u2019s ire, rather than engaging with protesters or rioters.\nAfter Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday, CNN footage showed that law enforcement from the California National Guard, Department of Homeland Security as well as Immigrations and Customs Enforcement fired non-lethal tear gas outside a federal detention center to disperse protesters.\nBefore that incident, Lah noted to me that guardsmen at the detention center at one point Sunday used their shields to push the crowd out. On Monday, they responded to a bottle being thrown at them by running down the steps and chasing people away.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s about the extent of it,\u201d Lah said. \u201cThe real face-to-face, the clearing of the streets, all of that has been the LAPD.\u201d\nIt\u2019s theoretically possible that the shows of force and the mere threat of a truly hands-on federal crackdown could dissuade protesters from getting more violent. But there is little evidence this has truly quelled the protests. And Lah noted that many people have showed up to protest because of the deployment of the guard.\nThe image Trump has painted in recent days evokes his yearslong flirtation with justified violence and the prospect of cracking down on demonstrators and supposedly evil forces within the United States. Trump has also spoken fondly of the ability of foreign strongmen to control their populations and squelch internal dissent.\nBut while that image obviously appeals to Trump, an actual crackdown is much more fraught. That creates the possibility of an overzealous response and ugly scenes. And CNN polling five years ago amid racial-justice protests showed that 60% of Americans didn\u2019t want the military called in to respond to domestic protests, compared to 36% who said they did.\nIt\u2019s possible Trump still aims for the real thing. But for now, he seems happy with trying to create the perception that the troops he called in are quashing the protests in LA.\nEmma Tucker and Kyung Lah contributed to this report."

Aired 1-1:30p ET\nAired October 23, 2024 - 13:00 ET\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n[13:00:00]\nKAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas.\nDonald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable. And, in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there, and no longer be there to rein him in.\nSo the bottom line is this. We know what Donald Trump wants. He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be, what do the American people want?\nThank you.\nBORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: We have been listening to Vice President Kamala Harris speaking there from the vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory, essentially calling out Donald Trump, reiterating reporting that Trump's former Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters that Trump invoked Hitler during conversations, saying that he wanted generals that were as loyal as Hitler's generals.\nShe went on to say that it is deeply troubling and dangerous that Trump would compare himself to Hitler, obviously, the former German leader responsible for millions of deaths, hundreds of thousands of American deaths, millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust.\nShe described Trump as unhinged and unstable and also added that in a second Trump administration, there would be no John Kellys around to restrain him from his worst instincts.\nBRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Yes, she's trying to say that he is increasingly unhinged and unstable and that what he wants is unchecked power.\nShe's trying to say, you have seen him before, but actually this is going to be a different thing if he is reelected.\nLet's -- we have a sound bite. Let's listen to it.\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GEN. JOHN KELLY (RET.), FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Certainly,\nthe former president is in the far right area. He's certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators. He has said that.\nSo he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\nHe commented more than once that Hitler did some good things too.\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\nKEILAR: And those are some of the comments that have created this moment that Harris is trying to capitalize here in this race.\nLet's bring in our panel here to talk a little bit about this, Kristen Soltis Anderson, Karen Finney, and Jim Sciutto with us.\nKristen, what do you think about what you're seeing here, as Harris is trying to highlight this moment, which does sort of hew to the reporting that we have had at CNN, which is that she does want to do this? She wants to highlight where Donald Trump is having these moments that may be alarming to some voters.\nKRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think it's clear that the strategy in the last week or two has been to pivot back to this messaging about Donald Trump as a threat to democracy.\nAnd I suspect the reason for this is that they view very reliable Republican voters who are skeptical of Donald Trump maybe not as someone that they could convince to outright vote for Harris. But they can convince them, do you really want to go to sleep at night knowing you voted for Donald Trump?\nAnd if they can plant that seed in the minds of enough of these Republicans who really don't like Trump, I think it's clear that that is a strategy they want to pursue. This reporting is obviously pretty serious, and it seems clear with her taking the bold step of saying, I'm going to do a press conference in the middle of the day, not taking questions, but I'm going to do a statement in the middle of the day, it's clear this is a message they want to drive home.\nKAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think there's actually a couple of other things too.\nI was in Pennsylvania over the weekend, and women voters who I spoke to who had previously voted for Trump, what they said was, I just -- he keeps talking about revenge, and I'm worried, what about me? This is a woman who's concerned about Social Security recently diagnosed with cancer, so her health care is on her mind.\nI don't hear him talking about me. I hear him talking about revenge, and my husband and I are worried about that.\nSo, I think part of it is also to say, if he's so focused on revenge, he's not going to be focused on you. So, voting for him is a risk. Is it a risk you're willing to take? And we think he's focused on -- he's not focused on you. He's focused on himself.\nAnd so I think they're trying to do a couple of things, and, frankly, suppress votes of people who may not vote for her, but maybe they will just say, you know what, I'm just not going to vote this time and won't vote for him again.\nSANCHEZ: Jim, in your most recent book, you actually published conversations you had with the former Chief of Staff John Kelly, in which he details this fascination that Trump has for Hitler.\nJIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, praise.\nI mean, if there's a historical figure that you would think everyone could agree on you cannot say a kind word about, it would be Adolf Hitler, I expect, right?\n[13:05:03]\nSo let me quote John Kelly's firsthand account, John Kelly, 40-year Marine general, rose from enlisted men to the highest rank, a four- star general, Gold Star father as well. Here is his firsthand account of Trump talking about Hitler.\n\"He said: 'Well, Hitler, he did some good things.' I said: 'Well, what?' And he said: 'Well, Hitler rebuilt the economy.' But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world. And I said: 'Sir, you could never say anything good about the guy, nothing. I mean, Mussolini was a great guy by comparison.'\"\nI should also note that Kelly recounted how he, much like Jeffrey Goldberg found in his \"Atlantic\" piece, also talked about how Nazi generals, Hitler's generals, were more loyal to him than American generals were to Trump.\nNow, this is, again, his chief of staff recounting words he heard from Trump in his face directly.\nThe other point I would make about this is that the praise for Hitler is -- and the praise for strongman authoritarians around the world is not limited to him, because Trump has said and continues to say, by the way, not in private, but in public, kind and praising words about Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Viktor Orban, who have -- who are not just authoritarians, but have committed crimes against their own people, right, turned the state against their own people.\nAnd, of course, he's saying those praising things as he's talking about an enemy within in this country. So the comments aren't just shocking. They're also consequential in that they give you a sense of how we might govern.\nKEILAR: We want to keep this conversation going, but we do want to go to Alayna Treene, who is in Georgia, following Donald Trump, because there is some reaction from the Trump campaign.\nAlayna, what are you hearing? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: That's right. There is. We\nhave heard a number of Trump advisers and people like Mark Meadows, Kash Patel really heavily push back on this.\nI'm going to read for you something that Steven Cheung, a top Trump campaign adviser, told me in response to some of this last night. He said -- quote -- \"that Kelly had totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his president well while working as chief of staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump derangement syndrome.\"\nSo, clearly, they are pushing back very heavily on this. But I do want to take a step back, because I have covered Donald Trump for a number of years. I also was covering the White House when John Kelly was serving as Donald Trump's chief of staff. And I think it's important to add the context of who John Kelly is.\nHe served in the military also. I'd note that his son was killed, and he also served in the military. So this is something that is deeply personal to Kelly. I know that he is someone who very much takes the Constitution very seriously, and he took that role very seriously.\nI think that's why when you listen to some of the recordings from \"The New York Times.\" You heard him say that he had told Donald Trump in the past while they were in the White House that: \"I don't serve you. I'm serving the Constitution.\"\nSo that's some of the context around this. But, also, I don't think we can overstate how big of a development this is coming just two weeks before the election. We know that it's not just Kelly among those who had served with Donald Trump when he was in office who have been kind of trying to raise alarm bells about what it would mean for him to be president once again.\nWe have also heard criticisms from Mark Milley, from Jim Mattis, from John Bolton, from Bill Barr, a lot of people who had served with him. And I think the timing of these comments is important because I think you're really seeing people in the 11th hour now say a lot of this publicly.\nAnd to that point as well, Kelly, this isn't entirely surprising from him. He has been very critical of Donald Trump in the past. And I know privately he has made similar comments about what has been said, the conversations between the two of them.\nI think the reason that he's taking it public now is clearly because he wants this to be seen in front of voters right before this November 5 election.\nNow, look, when I talk to other Trump advisers about this, this is really -- that statement I just read is kind of all of what they are saying. They're pushing back on this. They're saying the generals who have served with him are those who have been criticizing Donald Trump over some of these comments that they argue are not true, they're saying this is because Donald Trump has since turned on them. And so that's what you're going to hear a lot of his advisers continue\nto say. Now, as for Georgia today and whether or not Donald Trump will address this, I have a hard time believing that he's going to talk about this, either at his staff -- his first stop here in Georgia, which is in Zebulon, when he's meeting with faith leaders.\nAnd then, later today, he's going to be doing a much larger rally hosted by Turning Point Action. But, again, I think I cannot overstate the importance of the timing of this and also to keep in mind where these are coming from, which is John Kelly -- Boris, Brianna.\nKEILAR: Yes. Alayna, thank you so much for that.\nAnd just important to note, yes, these may be folks who are not in with Donald Trump anymore, but it just may mean they're not covering for him anymore, which is something that we saw during the Trump administration.\n[13:10:06]\nBut also, just to the point -- just to the point of the folks in the Trump orbit, Jim, who are trying to back Trump up and saying that he didn't say this, you have Kash Patel and Mark Meadows. And these are two individuals who are incredibly conflicted when it comes to their fates, their financial fates and how linked they are to Trump on this.\nThese aren't independent arbiters.\nSCIUTTO: Listen, one thing I will say about John Kelly, John Kelly has no desire, as a man who served in uniform, because he believes that men and women in uniform should not play a political role.\nHe resisted going public with this. I have had conversations with him face-to-face where I asked him, do you want to go on CNN and discuss this? he said: \"That's not my place.\"\nSo him going public -- and that began as background comments. Ten they began -- then they went on-the-record comments in print. And now you have a recording out there -- is something he does not do lightly. He is not desperate to be on TV. He is not desperate to be the center of headlines, in fact, quite the opposite.\nAnd then when you look at Steven Cheung and others -- and, by the way, I have gotten statements from Steven Cheung to the same degree when you come to him with firsthand accounts about Trump comments before. And it's a reflexive answer practically cut and pasted. So you have to place that statement against the reputations and credibility not just of John Kelly, but Mark Milley, Mark Esper, who served as his defense secretary, his vice president, who is not endorsing him, right, I mean, members of the Cabinet, et cetera.\nSo, listen, it's -- you and I can't decide for anybody who we believe. You can only say to folks who are watching right now, who do they find more credible?\nSANCHEZ: We're actually going to be speaking to former Defense Secretary Esper later this afternoon, so stay tuned for that.\nRight now, I want to get up to Eva McKend, who is live for us at the CNN town hall, the site of the CNN town hall that is expected later tonight with Vice President Kamala Harris.\nEva, you have been having conversations with folks on the campaign. Is this something that they saw themselves talking about just two weeks out from the election?\nEVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's certainly part of a broader argument, Boris, that the vice president has been making on the campaign trail, that the former president has been exhibiting behavior, especially over the last several weeks, in her view, that illustrates that he is unhinged, that he is unstable.\nShe's telling Americans, as she did today, do you want leader in the White House who would view the military as their personal militia? And the reason why she has been holding these country-over-party events in an appeal to conservative voters, Republican voters, is, they believe they have strength in this argument.\nThere are going to be voters that don't agree with her on every policy matter, but when it comes to this existential question and the future and the health of our democracy, the campaign very much believes they are in a strong position to make that argument. So that's why we saw the vice president almost engaging in a rapid response here talking about this in real time.\nThat being said, they know that Trump is not the only issue here. We expect her tonight at the town hall to lean heavily into her personal biography in an attempt to humanize herself, connect on a human level to the undecided and persuadable voters that will be asking her questions in this town hall tonight, as well as make an affirmative case for herself as she outlines her policy vision for America, which she describes as an opportunity economy.\nBut, yes, calling out the former president, sounding the alarm bell is also part of the campaign argument as well -- Boris, Brianna.\nSANCHEZ: Eva McKend live for us in Pennsylvania.\nYou will want to tune in for that town hall later tonight as well. It starts at 9:00 p.m.\nKaren, over to you.\nIt strikes me that the strategy here is partly try to persuade some Republicans for Democrats, partly try to have them see that maybe staying home is a better option. But how many of those folks are actually still out there? Because, over the last 12 months, we have seen so many Republicans, even those that criticize Donald Trump on January 6, that came out with all sorts of public statements against him come home, not just to the party, but to Trump himself.\nFINNEY: You know, there -- I talked to a couple of them actually this weekend, but they come in different categories. Some are just genuinely agonizing over, does it even matter if I vote?\nAm I even going to bother? And some are deciding, is it -- gosh, I don't -- there's things I don't know about her. They have concerns about him. And, again, it's particularly with younger voters, same thing. They know -- we always say to them, this is your future. And they know that.\nBut they also, again, feel like they have voted in the past, perhaps, and things didn't change enough.\nI will tell you one thing I think she has to do tonight, though. This conversation that we're having is really an elite media conversation, and it is for a certain level of voters. It's got to be brought down to the grassroots, to the people who live where she's going to be speaking.\n[13:15:05]\nAnd that is to say, not only did he treat the military this way when he was in office. He's currently actively trying to disenfranchise members of our military serving overseas. That's your sons and daughters that are serving. That may be your sons and daughters who sacrifice their lives for our country and for our values.\nShe's got to keep bringing some of these issues back down to, this is how it affects you right here, right now, today and how your life will change if I'm president or won't change if he is.\nKEILAR: With the voting challenges to the uniformed and overseas, you mean?\nFINNEY: Yes, absolutely, and the challenges that they have had there with the voting by mail.\nKEILAR: Yes, it's still up in the air in Pennsylvania. And we will see if it continues in other states, the challenges.\nWhat are you looking for tonight, Kristen?\nSOLTIS ANDERSON: So I think the big question that she has yet to answer is, what are your core values?\nShe has put out policy ideas, bullet point lists, I'm going to do this on homebuyer tax credit, I'm going to do this on childcare. And she's told us before about her bio. She's going to start a sentence tonight, I grew up in a middle-class family. Like, put that on your bingo card. That's going to be there.\nBut what I think voters are still wondering about, to the extent anybody still has these questions, is, there was 2019-2020 Kamala Harris, and now there's Liz Cheney's my best friend, I own a gun Kamala Harris,.\nWhere on that spectrum is her core? Who on the inside -- when she says, my values have not changed, what are those values? I think that is still the question mark that she has not yet -- she still hasn't filled that in yet. And I think that's what she will have to do tonight.\nSANCHEZ: And, Jim, when it comes to her point about a second Trump administration and potentially who would serve and who might be the guardrails, if any, what have you heard about a potential Trump -- second-term Trump Cabinet?\nSCIUTTO: Well, listen, that category of Republican -- and, by the way, not all Republicans, right? Some are members of the military service who serve both administrations like a Mark Milley, et cetera. We don't know exactly what their party registration is.\nRegardless, that category of person is very unlikely to be serving in a Trump administration, in part because they don't want to, and in part because Trump doesn't want them to, right, that Trump wants to have, and he said it explicitly, more loyalists who are going to be willing to carry out an agenda that goes further than what we saw in the first term.\nSo when you speak of guardrails, unlikely that they or many of them will be present. And, by the way, that's not just -- we're not just imagining that that took place in the first Trump term. I have reported about it. Our colleagues have reported about it, times when Trump wanted to do X and they pulled him back. I will just give you an example.\nTrump, by accounts in my book and others have had this as well, wanted to pull out of NATO at the summit in 2018. And it was Kelly and Bolton who pulled him back. And, by the way, he wanted to pull out because he felt like he wasn't treated well by the other NATO leaders at the time. There was not a grand strategic conversation about how we have got to realign ourselves towards whatever.\nIt was, he was angry and he's, like, I'm leaving. And Bolton and Kelly in the moment were able to pull him out of that. So, if you imagine decision-making like that without those guardrails, there might very well be consequences.\nSANCHEZ: A very transactional track record of Donald Trump making decisions based on the personal versus what might be good for the country.\nSCIUTTO: Yes.\nSANCHEZ: Jim, Kristen, Karen, appreciate you all. Thanks for joining us for the conversation.\nAnd, of course, be sure to tune in tonight as Anderson Cooper moderates a CNN presidential town hall with Vice President Kamala Harris. Again, it starts at 9:00 p.m. right here on CNN.\nNEWS CENTRAL returns after a quick break.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[13:23:03] SANCHEZ: Just moments ago, Vice President Kamala Harris responded to reports that former President Donald Trump praised Adolf Hitler during his time in office.\nTrump's own former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly telling \"The Atlantic,\" Trump said that he needed -- quote -- \"the kind of generals that Hitler had.\"\nKelly also told \"The New York Times\" that he'd heard Trump praise the Nazi leader more than once, claiming that Trump said -- quote -- \"Hitler did some good things too.\"\nHere's a bit of Vice President Harris' remarks.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nHARRIS: This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side by side in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.\nDonald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable. And in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSANCHEZ: Joining us now to discuss is Mark Esper, who served as defense secretary under President Trump. Secretary Esper serves on the board or as a strategic adviser for a handful of aerospace and defense-related companies.\nSecretary, thank you so much for being with us.\nFirst, do you have any reason to doubt General Kelly's remarks?\nMARK ESPER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Oh, not at all, Boris. Of course, we have heard these stories before.\nAnd so what's new is that John Kelly came out and has spoken to the press about it and he's on record, right? We have audio recordings of his answers. So, look, I -- John Kelly as a man of great integrity and character, and he served this nation well in uniform for decades and then, of course, out of uniform. And I have never had any reason whatsoever to doubt his honesty or integrity.\nSANCHEZ: Were there ever any incidents, Secretary, that you have not previously spoken about in which you heard Donald Trump use similar language or refer to American military personnel in a derogatory fashion?\n[13:25:05]\nESPER: No, not along the lines that John Kelly and others have outlined.\nOf he -- course, the incidents I recall is that he was very troubled by the fact that we would have America's wounded warriors out in public. And he did not like that. And I had a couple of instances where we'd have to have that discussion. And he would -- he just thought we should conceal them.\nAnd our view was, my view, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was that these were Americas heroes and it was important to show the American people and their colleagues, by the way, in the service that, when our heroes come home wounded, that we take care of them and that we will be with them all the time, and they weren't something to hide in the closet, but, in many ways, something to hoist up and to celebrate as, again, people who served our country, who gave all for our nation.\nSANCHEZ: Chief of Staff Kelly also said that he believed that Donald Trump fell under the definition of a fascist. Do you also consider Donald Trump to be a fascist?\nESPER: You know, I have spoken out against lowering the civil discourse in this country and personal attacks and labels and stuff like that.\nSo, look, I'm not going to get into that type of labeling, if you will. But John Kelly did something. And he looked it up in a dictionary. And if you look it up, I think everybody should, ask yourself, does he fall into those categories? And it's hard to say that he doesn't when you kind of look at those terms.\nBut he certainly has those inclinations. And I think it's something we should be worried about.\nSANCHEZ: And, Secretary, when you hear Trump reportedly say that he wants generals who are totally loyal to him, even above the Constitution, what could that mean if he's reelected?\nAre there any potential checks and balances to prevent him from, say, going after some of his political rivals using the military?\nESPER: Well, the first check should be that the military and civilians alike who serve in government swear an oath to the Constitution, not to a president, not to a party, not to political philosophy.\nIt's why the memoir I wrote two years ago now is entitled \"A Sacred Oath.\" And I think nobody lives at or understands it as well as the military, who is it's trained in our schools or academies, our ROTC programs. You're constantly reminded of it while you're on duty. It's reinforced multiple times.\nSo, look, I fully believe that the uniformed officers will live up to that oath to obey the Constitution and will not be will -- will not swear a loyalty oath to the president of the United States. And so my concern, of course, is to the institution, what will happen.\nThat was my concern during my tenure and, of course, in the summer of 2020, when he wanted to use the active-duty military, considered using the active-duty military to put down the protests and possibly even shoot protesters. And so my concern was about the institution of the military and then, maybe even more importantly, along those same line lines, the importance of the civil-military relationship in this country.\nIt's very unique. On one hand, the military is completely subordinate to civilian authority. But, on the other hand, we serve the American people. Our oath is to the Constitution, but we serve the American people. And what you don't want to do is break down those bonds of trust that have been there for decades and decades.\nWe saw that happen after the Vietnam War. We saw that happen after the killings at Kent State, if you recall. The National Guard opened fire on civilian protesters. We don't want to go back to that. The last institution, it seems, it has anything greater than a 50 percent legitimacy rate among the American people right now is the U.S. military, and we need to preserve that no matter what.\nSANCHEZ: Secretary Mark Esper, appreciate you sharing your perspective and joining us this afternoon.\nESPER: Thanks, Boris.\nSANCHEZ: Still to come this hour on CNN NEWS CENTRAL: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says they're seeing evidence that North Korean troops are being deployed to Russia. What it could mean for the war in Ukraine -- when we come back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)"

      "text": "The top US military officer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley, was so shaken that then-President Donald Trump and his allies might attempt a coup or take other dangerous or illegal measures after the November election that Milley and other top officials informally planned for different ways to stop Trump, according to excerpts of an upcoming book obtained by CNN.\nThe book, from Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, describes how Milley and the other Joint Chiefs discussed a plan to resign, one-by-one, rather than carry out orders from Trump that they considered to be illegal, dangerous or ill-advised.\n\u201cIt was a kind of Saturday Night Massacre in reverse,\u201d Leonnig and Rucker write.\nThe book, \u201cI Alone Can Fix It,\u201d scheduled to be released next Tuesday, chronicles Trump\u2019s final year as president, with a behind-the-scenes look at how senior administration officials and Trump\u2019s inner circle navigated his increasingly unhinged behavior after losing the 2020 election. The authors interviewed Trump for more than two hours.\nThe book recounts how for the first time in modern US history the nation\u2019s top military officer, whose role is to advise the president, was preparing for a showdown with the commander in chief because he feared a coup attempt after Trump lost the November election.\nThe authors explain Milley\u2019s growing concerns that personnel moves that put Trump acolytes in positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, including the firing of Defense Secretary Mark Esper and the resignation of Attorney General William Barr, were the sign of something sinister to come.\nMilley spoke to friends, lawmakers and colleagues about the threat of a coup, and the Joint Chiefs chairman felt he had to be \u201con guard\u201d for what might come.\n\u201cThey may try, but they\u2019re not going to f**king succeed,\u201d Milley told his deputies, according to the authors. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this without the military. You can\u2019t do this without the CIA and the FBI. We\u2019re the guys with the guns.\u201d\nIn the days leading up to January 6, Leonnig and Rucker write, Milley was worried about Trump\u2019s call to action. \u201cMilley told his staff that he believed Trump was stoking unrest, possibly in hopes of an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act and call out the military.\u201d\nMilley viewed Trump as \u201cthe classic authoritarian leader with nothing to lose,\u201d the authors write, and he saw parallels between Adolf Hitler\u2019s rhetoric as a victim and savior and Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud.\n\u201cThis is a Reichstag moment,\u201d Milley told aides, according to the book. \u201cThe gospel of the F\u00fchrer.\u201d\nAhead of a November pro-Trump \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d to protest the election results, Milley told aides he feared it \u201ccould be the modern American equivalent of \u2018brownshirts in the streets,\u2019\u201d referring to the pro-Nazi militia that fueled Hitler\u2019s rise to power.\nMilley will not publicly address the issues raised in the book, a defense official close to the general told CNN. The official did not dispute that Milley engaged in activities and communications that are not part of the traditional portfolio of a chairman in the final days of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to sit in silence while people try to use the military against Americans,\u201d the official said. So while Milley \u201ctried his hardest to actively stay out of politics,\u201d if the events that occurred brought him into that arena temporarily, \u201cso be it,\u201d the official said.\nThe official added that the general was not calling Trump a Nazi but felt he had no choice but to respond given his concerns that the rhetoric used by the President and his supporters could lead to such an environment.\nTrump on Thursday issued a lengthy statement attacking Milley.\n\u201cI never threatened, or spoke about, to anyone, a coup of our Government,\u201d Trump wrote in his statement, adding, \u201cSo ridiculous!\u201d\n\u201cSorry to inform you, but an Election is my form of \u2018coup,\u2019 and if I was going to do a coup, one of the last people I would want to do it with is General Mark Milley,\u201d Trump continued.\n\u2018This is all real, man\u2019\nRucker and Leonnig interviewed more than 140 sources for the book, though most were given anonymity to speak candidly to reconstruct events and dialogue. Milley is quoted extensively and comes off in a positive light as someone who tried to keep democracy alive because he believed it was on the brink of collapse after receiving a warning one week after the election from an old friend.\n\u201cWhat they are trying to do here is overturn the government,\u201d said the friend, who is not named, according to the authors. \u201cThis is all real, man. You are one of the few guys who are standing between us and some really bad stuff.\u201d\nMilley\u2019s reputation took a major hit in June 2020, when he joined Trump during his controversial photo-op at St. John\u2019s Church, after federal forces violently dispersed a peaceful crowd of social justice protesters at Lafayette Square outside the White House. To make matters worse, Milley wore camouflage military fatigues throughout the incident. He later apologized, saying, \u201cI should not have been there.\u201d\nBut behind the scenes, the book says Milley was on the frontlines of trying to protect the country, including an episode where he tried to stop Trump from firing FBI Director Chris Wray and CIA Director Gina Haspel.\nLeonnig and Rucker recount a scene when Milley was with Trump and his top aides in a suite at the Army-Navy football game in December, and publicly confronted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you guys getting rid of Wray or Gina?\u201d Milley asked. \u201cCome on chief. What the hell is going on here? What are you guys doing?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cJust some personnel moves.\u201d\n\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Milley responded, which Leonnig and Rucker write was said as a warning that he was watching.\n\u2018That doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2019\nThe book also sheds new light on Trump\u2019s descent into a dark and isolated vacuum of conspiracy theories and self-serving delusions after he was declared the loser of the 2020 election.\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, the book says Milley held a conference call each day with Meadows and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Leonnig and Rucker report the officials used the calls to compare notes and \u201ccollectively survey the horizon for trouble.\u201d\n\u201cThe general theme of these calls was, come hell or high water, there will be a peaceful transfer of power on January twentieth,\u201d one senior official told the authors. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an aircraft, our landing gear is stuck, we\u2019ve got one engine, and we\u2019re out of fuel. We\u2019ve got to land this bad boy.\u201d\nMilley told aides he saw the calls as an opportunity to keep tabs on Trump, the authors write.\nA second defense official told CNN that Milley and the Joint Chiefs met on both January 7 and 8, with some calling in virtually, to discuss not only what happened at the violent insurrection at the US Capitol but also to discuss their growing worry about the emerging \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios.\nOn January 12, they signed a memo rejecting the violence and told troops to stand strong, reminding service members of their obligation to support and defend the Constitution and reject extremism.\nThe second defense official said the \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios included everything from dealing with rumored unrest at every state capitol to the possibility Trump didn\u2019t leave office. \u201cWhat happens if the crazies take over, what do we do?\u201d was the focus of the discussion and essentially what became a mini-wargame to plan for possible scenarios.\nThere was concern in part about being \u201cready\u201d because they had seen the slow National Guard response on the Hill on January 6.\nIf Trump didn\u2019t leave the White House, it was going to be up to Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and the US Secret Service to deal with him and related domestic unrest. For the Joint Chiefs, the minute Democratic nominee Joe Biden was sworn in would be it \u2013 he would be the commander in chief at that point and Trump would no longer hold power.\nThe official said that a realistic scenario is none of the chiefs would have resigned. They would have not carried out illegal orders, but they would have made Trump fire them.\nLeonnig and Rucker also recount a scene where Pompeo visited Milley at home in the weeks before the election, and the two had a heart-to-heart conversation sitting at the general\u2019s table. Pompeo is quoted as saying, \u201cYou know the crazies are taking over,\u201d according to people familiar with the conversation.\nThe authors write that Pompeo, through a person close to him, denied making the comments attributed to him and said they were not reflective of his views.\nIn recent weeks Trump has attacked Milley, who is still the Joint Chiefs chairman in the Biden administration, after he testified to Congress about January 6.\n\u2018You f**king did this\u2019\nThe book also contains several striking anecdotes about prominent women during the Trump presidency, including GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former first lady Michelle Obama.\nThe book details a phone call the day after the January 6 insurrection between Milley and Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who has close military ties. Cheney voted to impeach Trump and has been an outspoken critic of his election lies, leading to her ouster from House GOP leadership.\nMilley asked Cheney how she was doing.\n\u201cThat f**king guy Jim Jordan. That son of a b*tch,\u201d Cheney said, according to the book.\nCheney bluntly relayed to Milley what she experienced on the House floor on January 6 while pro-Trump rioters overran police and breached the Capitol building, including a run-in with Jordan, a staunch Trump ally in the House who feverishly tried to overturn the election.\nCheney described to Milley her exchange with Jordan: \u201cWhile these maniacs are going through the place, I\u2019m standing in the aisle and he said, \u2018We need to get the ladies away from the aisle. Let me help you.\u2019 I smacked his hand away and told him, \u2018Get away from me. You f**king did this.\u2019\u201d\n\u2018Crazy,\u2019 \u2018dangerous,\u2019 \u2018maniac\u2019\nThe book reveals Pelosi\u2019s private conversations with Milley during this tenuous period. When Trump fired Esper in November, Pelosi was one of several lawmakers who called Milley. \u201cWe are all trusting you,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember your oath.\u201d\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Pelosi told the general she was deeply concerned that a \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cmaniac\u201d Trump might use nuclear weapons during his final days in office.\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I guarantee you these processes are very good,\u201d Milley reassured her. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be an accidental firing of nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you guarantee me?\u201d Pelosi asked.\n\u201cMa\u2019am, there\u2019s a process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will only follow legal orders. We\u2019ll only do things that are legal, ethical, and moral.\u201d\nA week after the insurrection, Pelosi led House Democrats\u2019 second impeachment of Trump for inciting the insurrection. In an interview with the authors, Pelosi said she fears another president could try to pick up where Trump left off.\n\u201cWe might get somebody of his ilk who\u2019s sane, and that would really be dangerous, because it could be somebody who\u2019s smart, who\u2019s strategic, and the rest,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThis is a slob. He doesn\u2019t believe in science. He doesn\u2019t believe in governance. He\u2019s a snake-oil salesman. And he\u2019s shrewd. Give him credit for his shrewdness.\u201d\n\u2018That b*tch\u2019\nThe book quotes Trump, who had a strained relationship with Merkel, as telling his advisers during an Oval Office meeting about NATO and the US relationship with Germany, \u201cThat b*tch Merkel.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018I know the f**king krauts,\u2019 the president added, using a derogatory term for German soldiers from World War I and World War II,\u201d Leonnig and Rucker write. \u201cTrump then pointed to a framed photograph of his father, Fred Trump, displayed on the table behind the Resolute Desk and said, \u2018I was raised by the biggest kraut of them all.\u2019\u201d\nTrump, through a spokesman, denied to the authors making these comments.\n\u2018No one has a bigger smile\u2019\nAfter January 6, Milley participated in a drill with military and law enforcement leaders to prepare for the January 20 inauguration of President Joe Biden. Washington was on lockdown over fears that far-right groups like the Proud Boys might try to violently disrupt the transfer of power.\nMilley told a group of senior leaders, \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, guys: These guys are Nazis, they\u2019re boogaloo boys, they\u2019re Proud Boys. These are the same people we fought in World War II. We\u2019re going to put a ring of steel around this city and the Nazis aren\u2019t getting in.\u201d\nTrump did not attend the inauguration, in a notable break with tradition, and the event went off without incident.\nAs the inauguration ceremony ended, Kamala Harris, who had just been sworn in as vice president, paused to thank Milley. \u201cWe all know what you and some others did,\u201d she said, according to the authors. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe book ends with Milley describing his relief that there had not been a coup, thinking to himself, \u201cThank God Almighty, we landed the ship safely.\u201d\nMilley expressed his relief in the moments after Biden was sworn in, speaking to the Obamas sitting on the inauguration stage. Michelle Obama asked Milley how he was feeling.\n\u201cNo one has a bigger smile today than I do,\u201d Milley said, according to Leonnig and Rucker. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it under my mask, but I do.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report."

      "text": "For years, it has seemed as if President Donald Trump really wanted to deploy the military on US soil and was just looking for the right opportunities to do it.\nIt\u2019s escalating \u2013 and in a way that reinforces how extraordinary and fraught Trump\u2019s gambit is.\nHe announced on Monday that he is placing the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and is deploying the National Guard to deal with crime in the city.\nThe former is unprecedented, while the latter \u2013 deploying the guard \u2013 has a handful of precedents in DC and other cities.\nBut as with Trump\u2019s first mobilization of the troops this year, two months ago amid protests in Los Angeles, he\u2019s stretching the bounds of presidential action for a situation that doesn\u2019t appear on par with past deployments. And this move is likely to add to fears \u2013 including among some former Trump administration officials \u2013 that the president is crossing a line on militarizing the homeland and politicizing troop deployments.\nTrump\u2019s stated rationale is that crime in DC is \u201cout of control.\u201d He and his allies have seized on a brutal recent assault of a former staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency.\nAs plenty have noted, though, DC violent crime is actually down in recent years. It spiked in 2023, but has been declining since then. The most recent data from the Metropolitan Police Department show violent crime is down 26% so far this year from 2024.\nThe data also show violent crime this year has been lower than at any point in at least six years, the Washington Post reported. In other words, it\u2019s lower than at the tail end of Trump\u2019s first term.\nNone of which means crime isn\u2019t a problem in DC or isn\u2019t high, relative to lots of other places. (In a Washington Post-Schar School poll this spring, crime, violence and guns were at the top of the list when DC residents were asked to name the biggest problem facing the district, although the share naming crime as a major problem was down significantly since 2022.)\nBut things had already apparently been moving in the right direction without federal intervention, which makes Trump\u2019s decision appear more arbitrary. If this move is warranted today, why wasn\u2019t it late in his first term?\nFrom there, it\u2019s a question of whether the problem fits with the extraordinary remedy Trump is putting forward \u2013 and whether it represents a troubling precedent.\nTop officials in Trump\u2019s first term worried about his penchant for calling in the troops \u2013 something they have said they talked him out of \u2013 because of its overtones of getting the military involved in domestic politics and its potential to inflame situations. Some of these same officials have said Trump has fascist tendencies.\nThe situations where Trump has called in the guard are unlikely to tamp down those fears.\nPresidents have done this before, but almost always to deal with large-scale disturbances like riots.\nA backgrounder issued by the National Guard in 2020 said state militia and the guard worked to quell race riots and labor strikes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But for 90 years between 1867 and 1957, no president federalized them.\nIn the years that followed, a succession of presidents federalized the guard to deal with ugly scenes during the Civil Rights era. Then it was called in to deal with race riots in Detroit (1967) and after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination (1968). Before Trump called the Guard in to deal with racial justice protests in DC in 2020, the last example had been the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles in 1992.\nIn other words, Trump is calling in the guard for a very different purpose even from the rare instances in which this has been done before.\nTrump\u2019s decision to call in the guard in Los Angeles two months ago would seem more in line with that history, but it too was unusual.\nThe violence amid the president\u2019s controversial immigration raids didn\u2019t seem to be nearly as serious or widespread as Trump claimed or at all comparable to the Rodney King riots. And it was the first time in 60 years that a president had called in the troops without a request from a governor. (A trial this week is set to determine whether Trump exceeded his authority.)\nAll of which reinforces how Trump is indeed breaking new ground.\nAmericans have been skeptical of using troops on US soil\nThe second reason this is so fraught is that it doesn\u2019t really seem to be something Americans are asking for \u2013 and could be something they are quite skeptical of.\nTrump in June didn\u2019t just deploy the guard to deal with the Los Angeles protests; he also sent in Marines. Those Marines were only there to protect federal property, but it raised the prospect of an even more heavy-handed crackdown.\nSome polls showed a split verdict, but a Washington Post-Schar School poll showed Americans paying close attention to the Los Angeles situation opposed sending the guard and the Marines 54-37%. And weeks later, a Quinnipiac University poll showed voters disapproved of sending in the Guard 55-43% and disapproved of sending in the Marines 60-37%. (Independents disapproved of the latter more than 2-to-1.)\nGoing back to 2020, CNN polling showed Americans said 60-36% that it would be inappropriate for a president to \u201cdeploy the U.S. military in response to protests in the United States.\u201d\nSo, Trump\u2019s proposition is a dicey one.\nAnd it\u2019s not just that the president has taken these extraordinary steps; he\u2019s repeatedly suggested they could be a part of a new ratcheted-up role for the military in policing the country.\n\u201cI can inform the rest of the country that when they do it, if they do it, they\u2019re going to be met with equal or greater force than we met right here,\u201d he said amid the mobilization in Los Angeles, referring to protesters getting violent.\nOn Monday, he left open the possibility of deploying active-duty troops in DC \u2013 i.e. not just the guard \u2013 although he said he didn\u2019t think that would be necessary. And he said he could take a similar approach to cities like Chicago and New York.\n\u201cThen I\u2019m going to look at New York, in a little while. Let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s do this together. Let\u2019s see. It\u2019s going to go pretty quickly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if we need to, we\u2019re going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster.\u201d\nTrump has threatened these things before. He\u2019s now following through in ways that seem designed to test our tolerance for a very different kind of country."

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump has announced the federalization of the DC Metropolitan Police Department and the deployment of the National Guard in response to crime in Washington, DC, despite overall crime rates being lower than in previous years. This unprecedented move raises concerns among former military officials about the militarization of domestic policing and the potential for authoritarianism, echoing fears expressed during his first term. Trump's actions appear to be more about creating the perception of a crackdown on crime rather than addressing an actual emergency, as many believe the situation does not warrant such federal intervention.",
