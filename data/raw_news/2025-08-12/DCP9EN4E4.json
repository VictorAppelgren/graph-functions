  "title": "I was a track champion \u2014 until the NCAA replaced me with a man",
  "description": "When a male athlete who identifies as a woman joined our team, he effortlessly broke both my school records \u2014 at his very first NCAA women\u2019s meet.",
  "content": "On Sunday, I outed myself: I am Track Athlete A in a major lawsuit, Gaines v. NCAA, that aims to win justice for women in college sports.\n\nFor two years, I\u2019ve lived in the shadows, watching my records, my opportunities, my dignity and my voice stripped away \u2014 not by happenstance, but by design, as colleges applied rules allowing male athletes into women\u2019s sports.\n\nMy university, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and my own coaches applauded as a man competed on our women\u2019s team, erased my records and those of other women, and was ushered into our locker room.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just steal medals \u2014 he stole the experiences we female athletes were promised: a safe and supportive environment, privacy, unity and leaders we could trust.\n\nFederal law was supposed to protect young women like me. Instead, Title IX was ignored.\n\nI\u2019m speaking now because no other girl should be forced to feel insignificant just to make room for a man.\n\nI\u2019ve been running track since I was 11 years old.\n\nThe joy of running and the reward of perseverance through adversity are deeply personal to me.\n\nI\u2019m hard of hearing, so there\u2019s a lot about my sport I can\u2019t take for granted \u2014 such as hearing my coaches\u2019 and teammates\u2019 voices during practice, or the starter\u2019s commands at the line.\n\nAt meets without a microphone, I sometimes missed the critical \u201cSet!\u201d command.\n\nI\u2019d have to throw my hand in the air to stop the race, drawing confused looks \u2014 and once, in a championship meet, a wave of boos from the crowd that nearly brought me to tears.\n\nBut I kept going.\n\nI learned to adapt, to fight through setbacks, and I earned my place through grit and determination.\n\nBy my sophomore year at RIT, I was a team captain and the school record-holder in the 60-, 200- and 300-meter dash.\n\nBut what I never expected \u2014 what I could not overcome \u2014 was lining up next to someone with the unmistakable physical advantages of a male body.\n\nNo amount of training prepared me for that.\n\nEverything changed my junior year when Sadie Schreiner, a male athlete who identifies as a woman, joined our women\u2019s track team.\n\nAt his very first NCAA meet competing in the women\u2019s category, Schreiner effortlessly broke both my 200-meter and 300-meter records.\n\nI never imagined I could be made to feel so worthless.\n\nLater during that season, Jacqueline Nicholson, RIT\u2019s executive director of athletics, met with the team to tell us that this man had no physical advantage over us, that the university supported him, and that we should too.\n\nThat\u2019s how I learned no one in charge was going to stick up for me, or any other woman on my team.\n\nI felt humiliated to compete for a school so willing to discard women\u2019s rights, wearing its jersey as if I silently endorsed my own violation.\n\nBut worst of all was how it drove a wedge through the heart and soul of our squad, robbing us of the intangible experiences and deep camaraderie that are built within a team of women.\n\nWhen NCAA President Charlie Baker announced in February that the association would comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning male athletes from women\u2019s sports, I felt hope.\n\nBut RIT communicated no changes \u2014 and Schreiner kept competing.\n\nWhile he was no longer earning points for RIT at women\u2019s track meets, he was instead running unattached \u2014 still beating women, just without the school\u2019s name next to his.\n\nDespite the headlines about the NCAA\u2019s policy changes, Schreiner continued attending our practices, using our women\u2019s locker room and receiving workouts and coaching attention meant to benefit and develop our women\u2019s team.\n\nWould this betrayal never end?\n\nI graduated in May, and my college sports career is over.\n\nBut it was permanently damaged by the opportunities I lost, the experiences I earned and can never get back.\n\nI joined Riley Gaines\u2019 lawsuit anonymously, fearing retaliation at RIT and elsewhere.\n\nYet with distance from campus, I have gained clarity and strength.\n\nI never want another woman to go through what my team was forced to endure in plain sight.\n\nFor violating the federal rights of women, and for abandoning us so openly, the NCAA must pay a price so high that no school or organization will ever dare to do such a thing again.\n\nWe need the law, and the consequences for breaking it, to be certain and clear.\n\nI deserve my records back, and I want the NCAA held accountable for taking them \u2014 and so much else \u2014 from me.\n\nCaroline Hill is a former sprinter and captain for the Rochester Institute of Technology.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

      "text": "UPenn is finally doing the right thing \u2014 and we should thank young women like Paula Scanlan and Riley Gaines who never gave up the fight\nWhat a victory for sanity \u2014 and for truth and fairness.\nThis week, the University of Pennsylvania apologized to female swimmers on their 2021-2022 roster who had to endure a season of changing next to a biological male in the locker room and competing with the strapping 6 foot 1 athlete Lia, formerly Will, Thomas.\nThey also restored any school records broken by Thomas, who became the first transgender athlete to win a division 1 NCAA title.\nThis wasn\u2019t some heartfelt moral reckoning, rather to resolve a US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation into the school\u2019s violation of Title IX for allowing a biological male to swim on the women\u2019s team.\nBut still, it\u2019s a win.\nIt\u2019s poignant that this about face was forced by Thomas because he was the figure who took the debate of trans athletes in women\u2019s sports from a niche issue to a full-on nuclear culture war battle.\nThis madness started relatively low key in 2017 when trans runner Andraya Yearwood took two titles in Connecticut high school girls track.\nThe following year, another trans runner, Terry Miller also ran girl\u2019s track, and the pair\u2019s participation and wins sparked a debate \u2014 and a long legal battle \u2014 over the state policy that allowed trans athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports.\nBut in 2021, when broad-shouldered Thomas jumped into the pool to compete as a member of the women\u2019s team, the issue was rightfully pushed to the national forefront.\nThomas was a member of the men\u2019s team at UPenn for three years, then took off a year to transition. He met the NCAA\u2019s hormone therapy requirements at the time, but was clearly a man amongst girls.\nHis physical advantage was undeniable. And it was ridiculous.\nNot that many could vocalize it. At the time, athletes, including Thomas\u2019 teammate Paula Scanlan, were told to shut up and put up. According to Scanlan, UPenn told its lady swimmers that his participation was a \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d and if they had any issues, they were provided with counseling services to \u201chelp\u201d them \u201cbe OK with it.\u201d\n\u201cThe university wanted us to be quiet and they did it in a very effective way. They continued to tell us that our opinions were wrong and if we had an issue about it, we were the problem and it\u2019s frightening and your future job is on the line,\u201d she said.\nNot only was it shameful to make them change in front of a male and have him crush other female swimmers in the pool, but an Ivy League institution squashing dissent from women in service of a confused man, was even more insane. It showed the school\u2019s disconnect with their once prized liberal values.\nBut it wasn\u2019t just UPenn. Thomas was celebrated across social media and in various outlets. In 2023, ESPN even included the trans athlete in their women\u2019s history month segment.\nIn December of 2021, as Thomas was smashing records, a fed up Scanlan spoke to Outkick, but did so anonymously.\n\u201cPretty much everyone individually has spoken to our coaches about not liking this,\u201d she said at the time.\nIn March of that year, a group of Ivy League parents wrote an op-ed published in The Post speaking about the injustice. \u201cParents, coaches, swimmers, and rational, logical people know this is grossly unfair.\u201d The group wrote anonymously to \u2018protect their kids.\u201d.\n\u201cFemale swimmers have not consented to this. In fact, many of them expressly said no. What response did they receive?\nBe quiet. A new ideology ruled. \u201cTranswomen are women\u201d no exceptions; the girls\u2019 concerns: \u201ctransphobic,\u201d the piece noted.\nEven on twitter \u2014 this was months before Elon Musk bought the platform \u2014 people were shut down and cancelled for \u201cmisgendering.\u201d Common sense discourse was verboten and more and more dominant trans athletes emerged in various sports, including cycling and track and field.\nAnd yet some courageous voices emerged \u2014 and thankfully never shut up. Riley Gaines swam for the University of Kentucky and tied with Thomas for fifth in the 200-yard freestyle at the NCAA tournament. She took up the cause at great personal risk.\nSimply by calling for fairness in women\u2019s sports, she was instantly branded a transphobe and a bigot. Scanlan soon unmasked herself and joined Gaines. (And organizations like Alliance Defending Freedom and Independent Women\u2019s Forum provided wind at the movement\u2019s back).\nNow, close to 80% of Americans believe biological men shouldn\u2019t play in women\u2019s sports. But back then, to say such a thing was an act of courage and defiance.\nThey raised the red flags and started a tidal wave \u2014 and took loads of licks in the process."

      "text": "UPenn slammed for nominating Lia Thomas for NCAA\u2019s \u2018Woman of the Year\u2019 award\nThe University of Pennsylvania is facing a wave of criticism from professional athletes for nominating transgender college swimmer Lia Thomas for the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s 2022 \u201cWoman of the Year\u201d award.\n\u201cThis is yet another slap in the face to women,\u201d Riley Gaines, a University of Kentucky swimmer who was also nominated for the award, tweeted in response to the news on Friday.\n\u201cFirst a female national title and now nominated for the pinnacle award in collegiate athletics. The @NCAA has made this award worthless.\u201d\nThomas \u2014 who won the 500-yard freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Women\u2019s Division I Swimming and Diving Championships earlier this year \u2014 is one of 577 graduating female student athletes nominated by their schools for the prestigious award.\nThe 22-year-old\u2019s record-smashing season this year has been mired in controversy with some critics claiming competing in the women\u2019s division gave her an unfair advantage because she was biologically born a male.\n\u201cThis award combines athletic performance with academics, service, and character. What character has Thomas shown other than sheer selfishness and entitlement?\u201d Gaines continued, accusing Thomas of showing \u201cdisrespect\u201d and \u201cdisregard\u201d for other female athletes.\nTennis legend Martina Navratilova also criticized the decision.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you?!!!!!!!?\u201d she tweeted at the NCAA.\nFormer NCAA swimming champ Marshi Smith, an outspoken critic against transgender women competing in women\u2019s sports, said UPenn is \u201cdoubling down on their anti-woman campaign\u201d by deciding to nominate Thomas for the honor.\n\u201c@RileyGaines deserves \u201cNCAA Woman of the Year\u201d for sheer guts alone!\u201d Smith tweeted.\nIn May, Thomas acknowledged the criticism against her in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and said she had been prepared for the backlash.\n\u201cI knew there would be scrutiny against me if I competed as a woman, and I was prepared for that,\u201d the star athlete said at the time.\n\u201cI intend to keep swimming \u2026 It\u2019s been a goal of mine to swim at Olympic trials for a very long time, and I would love to see that through,\u201d she said.\nLast month, the controversy surrounding transgender women in sports led to the world swimming\u2019s governing body, FINA, effectively banning them from competing in elite women\u2019s events.\nUPenn did not immediately comment on the criticism over Thomas\u2019 nomination for the NCAA award."

      "text": "Trump signs executive order banning men from women\u2019s sports \u2014 and branding visas with wrong sex as \u2018fraud\u2019\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday meant to keep biological men out of women\u2019s sports through Title IX \u2014 pressuring schools to comply with the mandate by threatening to pull federal funds.\n\u201cFrom now on, women\u2019s sports will be only for women,\u201d Trump said during the signing ceremony, flanked by dozens of female athletes of all ages in the East Room of the White House.\n\u201cIf you let men take over women\u2019s sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and risk your federal funding.\u201d\nThe order specifically directs the Education Department to \u201ctake all appropriate action to affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms\u201d and make clear \u201cthat women\u2019s sports are reserved for women\u201d and settle outstanding lawsuits in a manner \u201cconsistent with this policy.\u201d\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also been directed to deny visas \u201cmade by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes,\u201d according to Trump, who will be president at the time of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, was directed by the president \u201cto make clear to the International Olympic Committee that America rejects transgender lunacy.\u201d\nTitle IX, passed in 1972, prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or other education program that receives federal funding.\nIn the decades since, Title IX compliance has often been cited by colleges to increase their offerings of women\u2019s sports \u2014 and the law has received credit for the growth in popularity of events like women\u2019s basketball, womens\u2019 soccer and softball.\n\u201cIn recent years, many educational institutions and athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women\u2019s sports,\u201d Trump\u2019s order begins. \u201cThis is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.\u201d\n\u201cOn his first day in office, Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on schools across the country to allow students to compete in the sport of their \u2018gender identity,\u2019\u201d a White House official said on a background call previewing Wednesday\u2019s action.\n\u201cThat is a slap in the [face] to [the] countless female athletes who dedicate tremendous effort to be the best in their sport, only to be forced to compete with biological men.\u201d\n\u201cWe strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today\u2019s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement Wednesday night.\n\u201cTo that end, President Trump\u2019s order provides a clear, national standard. The NCAA Board of Governors is reviewing the executive order and will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration.\u201d\nTrump had campaigned on the promise of ending male participation in women\u2019s sports as many around the country rallied against trans women like Penn swimmer Lia Thomas setting new records in collegiate competition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a man playing in the game,\u201d Trump told Fox News back in October.\n\u201cYou just ban it. The president bans it. You just don\u2019t let it happen.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump admin sues California after civil rights probe faulted state for \u2018allowing males in girls\u2019 sports\u2019\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration sued California Wednesday after a Department of Education probe found the state had discriminated against women by \u201callowing males in girls\u2019 sports and intimate spaces.\u201d\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division alleged that the California Department of Education (CDE) and California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) violated Title IX and forced girls to be \u201cdisplaced from podiums, denied awards, and miss out on critical visibility for scholarships and recognition,\u201d according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court.\n\u201cThis discrimination is not only illegal and unfair but also demeaning, signaling to girls that their opportunities and achievements are secondary to accommodating boys,\u201d the filing stated.\n\u201cIt erodes the integrity of girls\u2019 sports, diminishes their competitive experience, and undermines the very purpose of Title IX: to provide equal access to educational benefits, including interscholastic athletics.\u201d\nThe complaint demanded a court order barring the policies, compensation for \u201cfemale athletes who have been denied equal athletic opportunities \u2026 including correcting past athletics records\u201d and a requirement that California turn in \u201cregular compliance reports\u201d for at least the next five years.\nThe DOJ\u2019s complaint noted that California\u2019s compliance was necessary since the $44.3 billion in federal funding the state received this fiscal year was conditioned upon compliance with Title IX.\nThe 1972 law mandates equal opportunities regardless of sex in schools receiving federal funds.\nThe suit comes after transgender athlete Lia Thomas was stripped of University of Pennsylvania swimming titles after the Ivy League school bowed to pressure from the Trump administration.\nPenn also agreed to issue formal apologies to every biological female competitor who lost out to a transgender competitor, following an Education Department probe of the university.\nA similar investigation led to CIF being ordered by July 7 to \u201crestore to female athletes all individual records, titles, and awards misappropriated by male athletes competing in female competitions\u201d \u2014 or face \u201cimminent enforcement action.\u201d\nKatie McGuinness, a female long jumper, had placed second against a trans athlete at the CIF\u2019s Southern Section Final in May, before the findings of the investigation were announced.\nThe feds, upon finishing their probe also asked the CDE to \u201csend a personalized letter apologizing on behalf of the state of California for allowing [McGuinness\u2019] educational experience to be marred by sex discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cWomen fought hard for these rights and it is the law and the president means business with it,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon told Fox News Wednesday.\nCIF governs more than 750,000 student-athletes in grades 9 through 12, per the DOJ.\nNearly 6 million K-12 athletes compete for titles in the Golden State, fewer than 10 of whom are transgender, a state official previously noted.\nCalifornia is one of more than 20 states that allows athletes to compete in sports that comport with their chosen \u201cgender identity\u201d \u2014 despite President Trump having signed an executive order in February barring the policy and threatening to pull federal funding to those states that persisted.\n\u201cThe Governor of California has previously admitted that it is \u2018deeply unfair\u2019 to force women and girls to compete with men and boys in competitive sports,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\u201cBut not only is it \u2018deeply unfair,\u2019 it is also illegal under federal law. This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect equal opportunities for women and girls in sports.\u201d\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom had acknowledged the \u201cissue of fairness\u201d but stopped short of calling for a ban on transgender athletes participating in women\u2019s sports during a debate with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on his \u201cThis is Gavin Newsom\u201d podcast in March.\nDuring a visit to the early primary state of South Carolina Tuesday, the California governor admitted that he \u201cstruggled with the issue of fairness when it came to sports.\u201d\n\u201cWe tried to figure that out a couple of years ago, and we were unsuccessful, and we struggled with that recently,\u201d Newsom said at the time.\n\u201cMy position is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, but I also think it\u2019s demeaning to talk down to people, and to belittle the trans community. And I don\u2019t like the way the right wing talks about the trans community. These people just want to survive.\u201d\nMost Americans \u2014 including up to 69% of Democrats \u2014 support sex-segregated sports participation, a New York Times poll found in January.\nStudies have also found that transgender female athletes maintain a competitive advantage over their biological female peers even after undergoing hormone therapy.\n\u201cThe CIF does not comment on legal matters,\u201d a rep for the athletic governing body said in a statement.\nNewsom\u2019s office and the California Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cThe California Department of Education cannot comment on pending litigation,\u201d a rep for the state office also said.\nA Newsom spokesperson pointed out that no court has yet adopted the Trump administration\u2019s interpretation of federal law and California is abiding by an existing state law \u201cpassed in 2013, signed by Governor Jerry Brown, and in line with 21 other states.\u201d\n\u201cAt a time when the Trump administration is withholding billions in funds for education, this ongoing attack is a cynical attempt to distract from the Trump administration\u2019s defunding of nearly 3 million girls enrolled in California\u2019s public school,\u201d the rep added."

The state must swiftly come into compliance with Title IX or face the consequences that follow.\u201d\nThe 1972 law is meant to protect equal opportunities regardless of sex in schools receiving federal funds.\nMost Americans \u2014 and as many as 69% of Democrats \u2014 support sex-segregated sports participation, a New York Times poll found in January.\nSeveral Western nations, including the UK, have also banned or severely limited the practice of hormone therapy and providing puberty-blocking drugs to children, citing physical and psychological harms and the need for further study of long-term effects.\nPast research studies show that transgender female athletes maintain a competitive advantage over their biological female peers even after undergoing hormone therapy to transition genders.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a day ending in \u2018Y\u2019 without the Trump Administration threatening to defund California. Now Secretary McMahon is confusing government with her WrestleMania days \u2014 dramatic, fake, and completely divorced from reality,\u201d said a spokesperson for Newsom. \u201cThis won\u2019t stick.\u201d\nThe Trump Education Department\u2019s warning for California also comes after the US Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law prohibiting hormone therapy for minors.\nTo reverse course, the California educational entities must inform any recipients of federal funding to \u201cadopt biology-based definitions of the words \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female,'\u201d according to Trump\u2019s Education Department.\nCalifornia\u2019s Interscholastic Federation must also \u201crestore to female athletes all individual records, titles, and awards misappropriated by male athletes competing in female competitions\u201d \u2014 including Katie McGuinness, who placed second against a trans athlete in the long jump at the federation\u2019s Southern Section Final last month.\nCalifornia\u2019s Education Department must in addition \u201csend a personalized letter apologizing on behalf of the state of California for allowing her educational experience to be marred by sex discrimination.\u201d\nAnd the state office will have to annually certify that any recipients of federal funds are in compliance with Title IX.\nIn California, there are nearly 6 million K-12 athletes but fewer than 10 are transgender, a state official noted. Just around 10 are transgender of the more than 500,000 NCAA student-athletes nationally.\nThe Golden State is one of more than 20 that allow transgender athletes to compete in sports identifying as a gender of their choosing.\nThe Education Department launched the investigation into the state\u2019s interscholastic sports federation on Feb. 12 after the organization said it was going to flout the president\u2019s executive order preventing transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports.\nThe department has dubbed June \u201cTitle IX Month\u201d and is \u201ccommemorating women\u2019s continued push for equal educational and athletic opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cThe California Department of Education believes all students should have the opportunity to learn and play at school, and we have consistently applied existing law in support of students\u2019 rights to do so,\u201d said spokeswoman Liz Sanders.\n\u201cThe CIF does not comment on legal matters,\u201d added a spokesperson for the athletic organization."

      "text": "Trump admin finds UPenn violated Title IX by letting transgender athletes compete in women\u2019s sports\nThe Trump administration announced Monday that it has determined the University of Pennsylvania violated federal civil rights laws by allowing transgender athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports.\nThe Ivy League school flouted Title IX rules by \u201cdenying women equal opportunities\u201d and allowing transgender athletes to \u201coccupy women-only intimate facilities,\u201d the administration said \u2013 giving UPenn 10 days to \u201cvoluntarily resolve these violations or risk a referral to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for enforcement proceedings.\u201d\n\u201cLittle girls who look up to Riley Gaines and Paula Scanlan can find hope in today\u2019s action \u2013 the Trump Administration will not allow male athletes to invade female private spaces or compete in female categories,\u201d Craig Trainor, the Education Department\u2019s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement.\n\u201cUPenn has a choice to make: do the right thing for its female students and come into full compliance with Title IX immediately or continue to advance an extremist political project that violates federal antidiscrimination law and puts UPenn\u2019s federal funding at risk,\u201d he added.\nThe Education Department\u2019s proposed resolution agreement requires UPenn to release a statement vowing to comply with Title IX in all of its athletic programs; restore athletic records, titles and awards that have been \u201cmisappropriated by male athletes competing in female categories\u201d; and apologize to the female athletes whose individual recognitions are to be restored.\nUPenn did not respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\nTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\nIn March, the Trump administration froze $175 million in taxpayer funding to UPenn after the school defied President Trump\u2019s executive order banning transgender women athletes of all ages from competing on girls and women\u2019s sports teams.\nA UPenn spokesperson told The Post at the time that the school was \u201cin full compliance\u201d with \u201cNCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams.\u201d\nThe elite school became the center of the controversy over transgender athlete participation after one of its male swimmers transitioned and joined the women\u2019s team before going on to win an NCAA Division I title.\nTrans swimmer Lia Thomas won the women\u2019s 500-yard freestyle after transitioning before the 2022 season.\nThomas also went on to tie for fifth place against University of Kentucky female swimmer Riley Gaines, who has since become an outspoken opponent of trans athlete inclusion in women\u2019s sports, and was referenced in Trainor\u2019s statement Monday.\nFormer UPenn female swimmers Grace Estabrook, Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist filed a federal lawsuit against their alma mater earlier this year over being forced to compete with Thomas.\nEarlier this month, the DOJ sued Maine\u2019s Department of Education over claims that the state violated Title IX by \u201cfailing to protect women in women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\u201cThe Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said at the time. \u201cThis is about sports, this is also about these young women\u2019s personal safety.\u201d"

      "text": "Riley Gaines speaks out on lawsuit challenging NCAA\u2019s transgender policies: \u2018It is time that we fight back\u2019\nRiley Gaines was among the 16 current and former female athletes who filed a lawsuit against the NCAA on Thursday, saying the organization\u2019s transgender policy violates Title IX.\nGaines, an OutKick contributor who hosts the \u201cGaines for Girls\u201d podcast and is the director of the Riley Gaines Center at the Leadership Institute, explained why it was time for them to take action against the organization.\n\u201cIt was time someone took action. I thought to myself for so long, \u2018I wish someone would sue,\u2019\u201d the former Kentucky swimmer said on \u201cOutKick The Morning.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how we win, someone has to sue \u2013 never once occurring to me that I could be a part of this, I could really help spearhead this along with ICONS and 15 other athletes that signed onto this lawsuit.\u201d\n\u201cI realized, [it is] us. We can fight back. It\u2019s what the left does so well. The other side, they throw around lawsuits like it\u2019s nothing. The ACLU has no problem suing. [Attorney General] Letita James in New York, of course she\u2019s sue-happy. \u2026 The other side has no problem suing.\u201d\n\u201cIt is time that we fight back, and we\u2019ve seen this. We\u2019ve seen a slew of de-transitioners who are now suing their doctors or their health care providers or state statutes that allowed them to be deceived and taken advantage of.\u201d\n\u201cThe tides are going to turn because ultimately this movement is driven by dollar signs. It is driven by money. People act out of a fear of not getting sued and by taking the actions that we have now. We are showing them that the other side is just as willing and just as capable to sue as they believe the trans rights activists would be to sue.\u201d\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\nReka Gyorgy, Kylee Alons, Kaitlynn Wheeler, Ainsley Erzen, Ellie Eades, Lily Mullens, Suzanna Price, Carter Satterfield, Kate Pearson, Katie Blankenship, Julianna Morrow, and athletes identified as Swimmer A, Swimmer B, Track Athlete A and Volleyball Athlete A were among the plaintiffs in the case."

      "text": "The NCAA has officially changed its gender eligibility policies to ban all biological males from women\u2019s sports one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to address the issue.\nThe governing body of college sports announced on Thursday afternoon its new participation policy for transgender student-athletes.\n\u201cA student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women\u2019s team,\u201d the new policy reads.\nThe new policy still allows biological females to compete on men\u2019s teams.\nThe previous policy, which had been in place in 2010, allowed biological males to compete in the women\u2019s category after undergoing at least one year of testosterone suppression treatment.\nTrump signed the \u201cNo Men in Women\u2019s Sports\u201d executive order in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D..C., in front of female athletes on National Girls & Women in Sports Day on Wednesday.\nNCAA President Charlie Baker responded to the executive order in a statement later on Wednesday, saying it provided a \u201cclear, national standard,\u201d and that the NCAA Board of Governors would review it and take steps to align the organization\u2019s policy in the coming days.\n\u201cThe NCAA is an organization made up of 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states that collectively enroll more than 530,000 student-athletes,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe strongly believe that clear, consistent and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today\u2019s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions. To that end, President Trump\u2019s order provides a clear, national standard.\n\u201cThe NCAA Board of Governors is reviewing the executive order and will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration. The Association will continue to help foster welcoming environments on campuses for all student-athletes. We stand ready to assist schools as they look for ways to support any student-athletes affected by changes in the policy.\u201d\nBaker previously addressed concerns over the issue of female athletes having to share teams and locker rooms with trans athletes during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in December. There, Baker insisted that female athletes have the option to find other accommodations if they\u2019re uncomfortable sharing with transgenders and that the NCAA\u2019s policies that allow trans athletes to compete against women are based on federal standards.\nThe previous policy has resulted in multiple lawsuits against the NCAA and its member schools. Former NCAA swimmer and current conservative activist Riley Gaines is currently leading a lawsuit over her experience of having to compete with and share a locker room with trans swimmer Lia Thomas at the 2022 national championships. She is joined by several other women athletes who have also been affected by trans inclusion.\nAnother lawsuit was filed Tuesday evening, when three of Thomas\u2019 former UPenn teammates came forward with their own experiences of having to share a team and locker room with Thomas and were allegedly gaslit by their university administrators and fed pro-trans ideology.\nTrump\u2019s Department of Education (DOE) also launched an investigation into potential Title IX violations that occurred at UPenn over the Thomas situation, San Jose State University and at the the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) for separate incidents.\nAt San Jose State, transgender volleyball player Blaire Fleming played three seasons on the women\u2019s team from 2022-24, as one of the Mountain West\u2019s top hitters, leading the team in kills. However, unlike UPenn\u2019s handling of Thomas, SJSU administrators allegedly withheld the truth about Fleming\u2019s birth sex from the other female players on the team, according to a lawsuit filed by 11 Mountain West volleyball players and a former SJSU assistant coach.\nAdditionally, the OCR will be actively reviewing athletic participation policies at a number of schools to evaluate their alignment with Title IX protections for female athletes, sources told Fox News Digital.\nLast week, the DOE notified K-12 schools and higher education institutions of a return to enforcing Title IX protections on the basis of biological sex.\nA recent New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don\u2019t think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women\u2019s sports. Of the 2,128 people polled, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women\u2019s sports.\nOf the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women."
