After a search, no guns were found.\nAuthorities eventually issued dispersal orders as local businesses closed their doors early.\nDOZENS ARRESTED AFTER MEMORIAL DAY VIOLENCE ROCKS JERSEY SHORE BOARDWALK\nWATCH: Police respond as hundreds of teenagers descend on New York beach for \u2018senior cut day\u2019\nOne juvenile was arrested for battery on a police officer and four were arrested for various misdemeanor charges, police said.\n\"It was the cops chasing the kids around, the kids fighting and then it just got rowdier and rowdier,\" an unnamed witness told Fox KTVU. \"I mean, my daughter is on social media. She's a teen, and she saw it days before I did, but, yeah, I don\u2019t know if the cops thought it was going to be as crazy as it was.\"\nThe Brentwood Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nThe rise in incidents throughout the country is sparking national headlines and concern among parents with their children are out of school for the summer.\nIn the body camera footage released from the events at the Illinois pool, an unidentified girl revealed to an officer that the invitation for the gathering was distributed through TikTok, a seemingly common trend that is concerning experts.\nPHILADELPHIA TEENAGERS CHARGED IN SERIES OF 'UNPROVOKED' ATTACKS WITHIN AN HOUR\n\"What\u2019s happening with large groups of teens overrunning malls and public spaces isn\u2019t just \u2018kids being kids,\u2019\" Jonathan Alpert, a New York City-based psychotherapist, told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s a symptom of a deeper cultural breakdown, and unless we\u2019re willing to address it, these flash mobs will only get worse.\"\nAlpert pointed to a growing lack of accountability among younger generations as a contributing factor to the bad behavior sweeping the nation.\n\"As a psychotherapist, I see a generation raised without enough structure,\" Alpert said. \"Too many parents have been afraid to say \u2018no,\u2019 schools hesitate to discipline and society tiptoes around holding young people accountable. The result is exactly what we're seeing play out across our country: Teens testing limits because they haven\u2019t learned where those limits are.\"\nDC-AREA MALL SHUT DOWN AFTER MULTIPLE FIGHTS IN FOOD COURT, 3 TEENS HIT WITH RIOT CHARGES\nThe use of social media also plays a unique role in not only allowing teens to organize quickly, but encouraging them to act out for online validation, according to Alpert.\n\"Social media has only made it worse,\" Alpert said. \"These gatherings aren\u2019t spontaneous. They\u2019re staged for likes, shares and clout. The behavior escalates because there are no real consequences.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe licensed psychotherapist implores parents, law enforcement and businesses to work together to reach a solution regarding not only holding children accountable, but keeping them safe.\n\"Businesses and communities must crack down with clear, consistent enforcement,\" Alpert said. \"But let\u2019s not pretend this is just a policing issue. It\u2019s a parenting issue. It\u2019s a cultural issue. And unless adults step up and model respect for rules and shared spaces, we\u2019ll keep seeing teens treating public areas like their personal playgrounds.\""

      "text": "To curb rising youth violence, city leaders in Fayetteville, North Carolina, are implementing a new citywide curfew for minors.\nFayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin told Fox News Digital that the city recorded nearly 2,000 incidents of interaction or arrest involving minors over about a 16-month period.\n\"We looked at the last couple of quarters of the previous year, and then the first two quarters of this year, and it was almost 1,900 incidents of arrest or crimes that had been committed by juveniles. And so\u2026 we know we have a problem there, and we want to make sure that we're proactive to deal with it,\" Colvin said.\nWith the new ordinance, kids under 16 are prohibited from being in any public space between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., with some exceptions, including those who are accompanied by parents or guardians or another authorized adult escort, running direct-route errands, traveling to and from work, responding to emergencies, attending supervised activities such as sports or school events, and participating in religious services.\nJERSEY SHORE BOARDWALK MAYHEM PUTS BLUE STATE'S 'SOFT' CRIME APPROACH UNDER MICROSCOPE\nFayetteville is home to Fort Bragg, known briefly as Fort Liberty, the largest U.S. Army base by population. As of this week, the city is still in an \"educational\" period in which those who violate the curfew will be informed of the new rules, but punishments such as citations and detentions may occur as time goes on.\nAdults 17 and up, including parents and business owners, who are responsible for youths found to be in violation of the curfew may face a Class 3 misdemeanor charge and a maximum fine of $500.\n\"Right now, the way that the ordinance is set up\u2026 all of our punitive actions will take place against the parents. Whoever the responsible party is \u2013 the custodian of that kid \u2013 will be issued citations and possibly subject to fines and maybe arrest in certain cases of repeated violations,\" Colvin said. \"And we're going to let them know that there are judicial consequences to inaction.\"\nIf minors are continuing to be a problem because of parental neglect, then there are consequences.\nColvin brought up one incident in particular that happened earlier this year, when a 12-year-old girl named Adrianna Bethea was shot at a carnival in March, according to the Fayetteville Police Department and the mayor's office.\nThe young cheerleader was transported to a nearby hospital in critical condition and is fighting to walk again after she was shot in the back and the chest, according to CBS 17. No arrests have been made in connection with the shooting so far.\n\"A group of kids got into an altercation, and a gun was pulled, and a young lady was shot, and she's paralyzed,\" Colvin said. \"That spoke volumes to me. I knew her family, and it really made me angry. I'm a father of three daughters, and I've taken my kids to carnivals. I just think that our citizens deserve firm action.\"\nSPRING BREAK CRIME PLUMMETED IN FLORIDA HOT SPOT AFTER WARNING GOES VIRAL\nThe mayor's office introduced five new safety recommendations in April following the shooting, including the youth curfew, and the Fayetteville City Council \u2013 on which Colvin served four years before becoming mayor \u2013 adopted all of them.\nTwo city council members, Deno Hondros and Mario Benavente, voted against the curfew. They did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nVIRGINIA TOWN BACKS AWAY FROM DISSOLVING POLICE DEPARTMENT AFTER CITIZEN UPROAR\nOther cities have implemented similar youth curfews, including Charlotte, North Carolina's largest city. Colvin said Fayetteville's curfew model is based on Charlotte's.\nIn addition to the curfew, Fayetteville expanded youth recreational activities \"and partnerships with organizations who were already doing mentorship-type activities,\" the mayor said. He brought up a new youth \"midnight\" basketball program, which does not actually take place until midnight but was extended to later hours. Certain youth centers will also be expanding the activities they offer, according to Colvin.\nNC POLICE RELEASE NEW PHOTO OF MISSING GIRL MADALINA COJOCARI ON HER 14TH BIRTHDAY\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA new chief will join the Fayetteville Police Department next week, and Colvin expects the department head to help implement the new ordinance.\n\"I'm certain that they will make sure that they are presenting a professional response to it. They're training their officers as to the terms and conditions of what their role will be. They're setting up the partnerships that are necessary because the city can't do this alone. We'll need social service, we'll need juvenile justice, and we need the other governmental units that have a role in this space. This is an ecosystem. That we all have to work in to create a safer, better environment for our young people.\""

      "text": "Eleven people, including nine teenagers, were arrested at a community drone light show in South Jersey Saturday after multiple fights were instigated by a crowd that swelled to more than 500 kids and young adults, according to police.\nThree police officers were also injured in the chaotic crowd gathered at the Veterans Memorial Park in Gloucester Township Saturday night, local police said Sunday.\nOne of the officers was struck by a bicycle, leading to a 33-year-old man from Camden being arrested and charged with aggravated assault on a police officer. The same man was also charged with attempted escape for slipping out of handcuffs while being transported to jail, police said.\nAnother man, 18, was arrested for disorderly conduct.\nThe officers involved with the bike collision declined medical treatment. The other injured officers, one from Gloucester Township and the other from Clementon, sustained minor injuries while mediating multiple fights, police said.\nThe show was part of Gloucester Township Day, an annual event the municipality holds with rides, games and food vendors. It was scheduled to begin at noon and last until 10 p.m., according to Gloucester Township\u2019s website.\n\u201cThe lawless of groups of unsupervised juveniles and young people acting with total disregard for others ruined a great family-oriented event, which has taken place to raise funds for the Gloucester Township Scholarship Committee for over 40 years,\u2019' Gloucester Township Police Chief David Harkins said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThis type of lawlessness and violent riotous behavior will not be tolerated, and will not define the great community of Gloucester Township.\u201d\nThe nine teenagers arrested ranged from 13 to 17, police said. Eight of the nine were from towns in Camden County. Seven were boys and two were girls. All were charged with disorderly conduct and released to their guardian.\nFamilies congregated in the park off Chews Landing Road were awaiting the drone show to begin when an influx of kids and young adults began to be dropped off at the event, police said. The crowd is believed to have swelled to more than 500 people.\nFighting between large groups began around 8:40 p.m., police said. They ran \u201crecklessly\u201d through the crowd while officers fought to maintain order, describing their actions as \u201chostile and disorderly,\u2019' according to police. Two people were arrested for disorderly conduct.\nAdditional officers from across Camden County were called to the scene to tame the crowd, police said.\nThe light show, police said, began early because of the dangerous situation, leading to officers dispersing the crowd from the park\u2019s field once it ended. Large groups moved to a shopping plaza nearby, continuing to fight and causing more police to be sent to the area.\nFighting continued for two hours, ending at around 11 p.m., when police deemed the situation under control. Two minors were injured because of the melees but were released into their guardian\u2019s custody.\nMany of those inciting the fights were dressed in black clothing and covered their face with medical masks and sweatshirts, police said.\nThe scenario was similar to that of Memorial Day weekend in Ocean City in Cape May County, where teenagers sparked a brawl on the town\u2019s boardwalk, resulting in a 15-year-old being stabbed. Similar disarray happened in Wildwood and Seaside Heights.\nThe New Jersey State PBA condemned the actions of the teenagers in a statement on X on Sunday.\n\u201cOut of control juveniles with no accountability is not limited to the Jersey shore,\u2019' the PBA statement said. \u201cOfficers were injured, and the event was canceled yesterday. Things must change.\u2019'\nSixty-eight Gloucester Township officers were assigned or responded the event, and at least 30 were considered mutual aid from towns nearby, police said. The fights were being investigated.\nHarkins credited the officers for showing restraint to limit injuries while working to control the violence.\n\u201cI was proud to serve with all of these officers who put their safety on the line to bring this difficult situation under control,\u201d Harkins said. \u201cI am thankful that more injuries were not sustained to officers, the families attending the event, and even those involved in this disorderly conduct.\u201d\nStories by Eric Conklin\nThank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.
