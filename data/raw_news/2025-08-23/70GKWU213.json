      "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New England Patriots wide receiver Ja'Lynn Polk, the 2024 second-round pick who is hoping to rebound from a challenging rookie season in which he was limited to 12 receptions for 87 yards, will undergo shoulder surgery that could threaten his 2025 season, a source confirmed to ESPN.\nHow long the injury ultimately sidelines Polk, and if he could potentially return at some point later in the season, will be contingent on what doctors find in surgery, a source said.\nThe injury occurred in the Patriots' preseason opener Aug. 8 when Polk was tackled on a 1-yard run around left end by Washington Commanders defensive back Noah Igbinoghene and landed on his right side. Polk immediately came out of the game, holding his right arm, and hasn't practiced since.\nThe Patriots selected Polk 37th last season, having traded down from No. 34 with the Los Angeles Chargers, who selected receiver Ladd McConkey -- an exchange that has dramatically favored the Chargers after McConkey totaled 82 receptions for 1,149 yards and seven touchdowns.\nUnder former coach Jerod Mayo and former offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, the 6-foot-1, 203-pound Polk appeared in 15 games (seven starts) last season, totaling 45% of the offensive snaps, before being placed on injured reserve in the final week of the regular season due to a shoulder injury.\nPolk was eyeing a fresh start under the new regime of coach Mike Vrabel and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, but even before the injury he faced an uphill climb to secure a roster spot behind Stefon Diggs, Kayshon Boutte, DeMario Douglas, Mack Hollins and 2025 third-round pick Kyle Williams.\nDespite passing his initial physical upon reporting to training camp, Polk had been held out of the first four practices this summer after experiencing muscle tightness, according to a source.\nUpon his return, he worked mostly with the reserves leading up to the injury in the preseason opener.\nNFL reporter Jordan Schultz first reported Polk's status."

Vrabel took issue with the line of questioning.\n\"Did you really believe that, Phil?\" Vrabel responded when asked about Diggs. \"You\u2019re a smart guy. I don\u2019t know where you went to school.

He recently received medical clearance to return to practice.\nHowever, the four-time Pro Bowler was not in uniform for Saturday's preseason game against the Minnesota Vikings. He also sat out last week's preseason opener due to what was described as a \"coach's decision.\"\nVrabel said the team is taking a wait-and-see approach for Week 1.\n\"I don\u2019t know the context of which he said it. You\u2019d have to help me. He\u2019s been here almost every day. I\u2019m excited where he\u2019s at, and we\u2019ll see when Week 1 comes,\" Vrabel said.\nDiggs was noncommittal when asked earlier this week if he would suit up Sept. 7.\n\"We\u2019ll see. Everybody\u2019s excited, man. I\u2019m just taking it day by day. I feel great,\" Diggs said during a sitdown on the \"Scoop City\" podcast.\nDiggs suggested the Patriots coaching staff was not optimistic about the prospect of him taking the field when the team opens its season against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\"I mean, I'm pushing the needle always,\" Diggs said. \"I'm always doing more than less, and we\u2019ll see about Week 1. I don\u2019t know how I feel about it. We\u2019ll see. The coaches aren\u2019t too excited. I\u2019m not too excited. I\u2019m just trying to take it day by day, so we\u2019ll see.

All six of the Patriots' Super Bowl victories were achieved with Bill Belichick as the head coach and Tom Brady as the quarterback.\nThe Patriots were one of the original teams in the American Football League (AFL), founded as the Boston Patriots in 1959. They became the New England Patriots in 1971. The team's home base is in Foxborough, Massachusetts, where they play their home games at Gillette Stadium.\nThe Patriots' dynasty lasted many years, with Belichick and Brady leading the team to become the one to beat. The team holds the record for the most Super Bowl appearances, with 11. Since Brady left for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nand retired shortly thereafter, the Patriots have been working to rebuild.\nThe team has been owned by Robert Kraft since 1994. They are coached by former Patriot player Mike Vrabel, and the young Drake Maye is the team's quarterback."
