      "summary": "Alphabet shares surged 8.5% after a judge ruled it need not divest Chrome or Android, lifting the Nasdaq and S&P 500 by about 1% and 0.4% respectively, while the Dow fell 0.3%. The rally was supported by softer U.S. labor market data, boosting expectations of a Fed rate cut, and by strong gold stocks, though oil prices fell, weighing on energy equities. Asian markets slipped, but European indices gained modestly. Treasury yields fell 6.2 bps to 4.215% as bond prices recovered.",
