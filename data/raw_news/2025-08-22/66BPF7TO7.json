  "content": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 The world\u2019s leading authority on food crises said Friday the Gaza Strip\u2019s largest city is gripped by famine, and that it is likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\n\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\n\nThe IPC determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel\u2019s restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing high levels of starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\n\nThe grim milestone - the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East - is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been in a brutal war with Hamas since the militant group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel says it plans to escalate the war soon by seizing Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, which experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.\n\nThe IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.\n\nMore than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said. Last month, the IPC said the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was unfolding in Gaza, but stopped short of an official determination.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \u201clies\u201d promoted by Hamas. After the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the U.N. and Palestinians in Gaza say what\u2019s entering is far below what\u2019s needed.\n\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the report Friday, calling it \u201cfalse and biased.\u201d The agency, known as COGAT, rejected the claim that there was famine in Gaza and said that significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\n\nIn a post on social media, Israel\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs also rejected the findings, saying the IPC report was \u201cbased on Hamas lies.\u201d It said that more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks with staple foods.\n\n\u201cA rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,\u201d said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\n\nIsrael\u2019s plan to escalate the war in Gaza City weeks after a warning that famine was beginning there demonstrates how \u201cintentional the famine is and how Israel wields starvation,\u201d he said.\n\nNetanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel\u2019s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.\n\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC has previously determined famines in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region last year.\n\nThe IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:\n\nAt least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they\u2019re too thin for their height. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive and its restrictions on access to Gaza have made collecting data difficult.\n\nThe data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\n\nThe IPC warned that a third of Gaza\u2019s population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.\n\nAlex de Waal, author of \u201cMass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\u201d and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.\n\n\u201cSadly, it seems that it\u2019s necessary for experts to shout \u2018famine!\u2019 before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,\u201d he said.\n\nIsrael has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.\n\nIsrael eased those restrictions in May and says there\u2019s currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. But it also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.\n\nThe traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.\n\nWitnesses, health officials and the U.N. rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.\n\nOn the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people, about the population of Washington.\n\nThroughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighborhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\n\nDoctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.\n\nKirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City\u2019s Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.\n\nShe said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished.\n\nIf Israel evacuates people from the city ahead of its new offensive, thousands will be too weak to leave, said Blacka. \u201cBecause of the starvation it will put extra strain on already depleted bodies and will lead to the death of many of the Palestinians,\u201d she said.\n\nFamilies in Gaza City say they\u2019re watching their loved ones waste away.\n\nYousef Sbeteh\u2019s two teenage children were injured by shrapnel during an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they\u2019ve both lost weight because there hasn\u2019t been enough food, he said, adding that he can\u2019t afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions.\n\nHis 15-year-old daughter Aya lost nearly 20 kilograms (44 pounds), or about 30% of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms (33 pounds). The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.\n\n\u201cDoctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,\u201d Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter. \u201cBut I can\u2019t provide that now.\u201d",
