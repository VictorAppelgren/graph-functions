      "summary": "Bayer Leverkusen, under new coach Erik ten Hag, secured a 4‑0 win over fourth‑tier Sonnenhof Großaspach in the first round of the German Cup, with goals from Patrik Schick, Arthur, Christian Kofane and Álex Grimaldo; the match featured two red cards and a 40‑minute pause due to a hailstorm. Union Berlin routed FC Gütersloh 3‑0, scoring through a free‑kick by Robert Skov and goals from Leopold Querfeld and Danilho Doekhi, while their goalkeeper had to leave early and was replaced by Matheo Raab. The article also briefly notes other first‑round fixtures, including a Magdeburg‑Saarbrücken match at Ludwigspark Stadium. Overall, the cup opener showcased decisive victories for Leverkusen and Union Berlin amid weather disruptions and squad changes.",
