      "feedback": "The draft mixes multiple assets (UST 10‑year, DXY, SPX, mortgage rates) and lacks a clear causal chain for each scenario. Tighten focus to the single asset in the SECTION FOCUS (e.g., UST 10‑year) and remove all off‑topic commentary. For each “Up/Down” line, explicitly link the driver to the yield via a quantified mechanism (e.g., “core PCE > 2.6% → 10‑year term premium ↑ > 10 bp” with (97MD1FHW8)). Replace vague “invalidates dovish bias” with a concrete yield impact and probability derived from the cited source. Ensure every probability is backed by a numeric range from the source (e.g., “35% probability of > 10 bp rise” citing (97MD1FHW8)). Remove the “Tariff‑driven inflation spike” line unless you can tie it to a specific tariff data point and quantify its effect on the spread (use (1DEM6P1Y2)). Consolidate the trade plan: if tradable, present a single swing trade line with entry, stop, target, R/R, and trigger; if not, give a concise outlook line. Drop any mention of mortgage rates, SPX, or DXY unless they are part of a direct transmission path to the 10‑year yield. Finally, add a confidence score (0–100) for each scenario, citing the source that informs it. This will satisfy the “no filler” rule, keep the analysis within the 4‑line mover format, and meet the citation and probability requirements.",
