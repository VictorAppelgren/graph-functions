  "title": "Dental Check-Up Frequency: Is Six Months Still the Standard?",
  "description": "The age-old six-month dental check-up rule is facing scrutiny. New research suggests a personalized, risk-based approach may be more effective.",
  "content": "The End of the Universal Timeline?\n\nFor so long, it\u2019s just been the rule. Six months. Like clockwork. You go, we clean, we check. Rinse and repeat. But lately, we\u2019ve had to ask ourselves: Why six months? Is it actually... necessary for everyone? Because, honestly, the more we dig into the research, the less clear that \u2018standard\u2019 really looks [1].\n\nThink about it. We\u2019ve always been taught this blanket approach. Everyone. Twice a year. But a Cochrane review, pretty high-certainty stuff, looked at patients over four years. Some went every six months. Others? They went based on their risk. What did they find? Pretty much no real difference. Not in cavities. Not in gum bleeding. Even quality of life measurements were similar [2]. That hits you a bit, doesn\u2019t it? This suggests that just showing up twice a year, no matter what your mouth looks looks like, might not be doing much extra for some people [3] [4].\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just one study. A 2023 review, a scoping review, basically summed it up: the evidence for these biannual or biennial visits? Weak. Low quality, even. It makes you wonder. We\u2019ve built entire practice models around this idea, and the science... it\u2019s not quite there to back it up for everyone. What they\u2019re saying, loud and clear, is we need to tailor this [5] [6]. Give people guidance based on their mouth, their history, their risk. Not just a calendar.\n\nThe old saying, \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d But what if it was never actually \u201cfixed\u201d in the first place, just widely assumed? We\u2019ve got to get smarter about this. More efficient. More personalized. It\u2019s a shift. A big one, maybe.\n\nNow, when we talk about kids, that\u2019s where it gets even trickier. We want to protect those little mouths, right? Get them started early. So, the leaning has been to keep those 6-month checks going. It makes intuitive sense. Catch problems fast. Teach good habits [9].\n\nBut even here, the data isn\u2019t as solid as we\u2019d like. A 2017 review, for instance, still points to 6-month intervals for prevention in kids. Fair enough. But then it mentions a randomized trial that showed healthy kids, if they only went every two years, didn\u2019t really have more cavities. Two years! That\u2019s a jump.\n\nAnd a Finnish study, way back in 2001, even found that adolescents, whether they\u2019d had cavities before or not, didn\u2019t show much difference in outcomes despite similar check-up schedules. This really challenges the idea that one size fits all, even for our youngest patients [8].\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, the history of the 6-month rule itself? It\u2019s not some grand scientific discovery. A 2003 review in the British Dental Journal straight up said there\u2019s no high-quality evidence. None. To either support or deny it. A 2005 analysis, echoing that, found only one relevant trial with a tiny participant count and a high chance of bias. It\u2019s a bit uncomfortable, isn\u2019t it? To realize how much of what we do is based on... tradition. Not hard science [7].\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say dental visits aren\u2019t important. Far from it. Especially for kids. A 2025 study showed that regular visits, plus teaching them how to clean their teeth, totally delayed or prevented major treatments. And a 2023 report from Pediatrics hammered home the point that kids\u2019 oral health is still a problem, and pediatricians, even general doctors, need to step up and prevent dental disease early. It\u2019s about preventing problems. Getting them in for a check-up. But maybe, just maybe, not always every six months [10].\n\nSo, What Now?\n\nThe takeaway here isn\u2019t to tell everyone to stop coming in. Absolutely not. The value of good oral care, of catching things early, of guiding patients\u2014that hasn\u2019t changed. What is changing is the rigid timetable. We\u2019ve got to stop thinking of dental care as a uniform commodity.\n\nFor people who always have issues\u2014perio patients, those with rampant decay, or specific medical conditions? People going through chemo, for example, they\u2019ll need a different kind of support, maybe even just partial evaluations if time is short. Their frequency will be higher. Has to be. And primary care doctors, they still have a big role in watching out for dental health. It\u2019s a team effort.\n\nBut for your average patient, someone with pretty good hygiene, low risk of decay, stable gums? Do they really need that chair time every six months? The evidence is suggesting maybe not. We, as a profession, need to move towards something more sensible.\n\nA risk-based schedule. It just makes more sense. It\u2019s more efficient. And it\u2019s better care, because it\u2019s tailored. It means really looking at each patient, not just ticking a box on a calendar. It means shifting our mindset. From simply following a rule, to actively managing risk. That\u2019s the real work.\n\n[1] Fee, P. A., Riley, P., Worthington, H. V., Clarkson, J. E., Boyers, D., & Beirne, P. V. (2020).

  "summary": "The article discusses the changing trend in dental check-ups, asking whether the six-month rule is still the standard for everyone. A Cochrane review found that while patients over four years went to every six months, there was no difference in outcomes, including cavities and quality of life measurements. This suggests that just showing up twice a year might not be beneficial for some people. The author suggests that we need to tailor this approach based on individual individuals' risk and their mouth, history, and risk. The article also notes that a recent study from Finland found that adolescents with similar check-up schedules did not significantly improve their outcomes despite having had cavities before or not. The takeaway is that the value of good oral care is not always being provided, but it's about preventing problems early.",

      "text": "Key Points\n-\nThis review demonstrates a lack of consistency in the direction of effect of oral health outcome measures with different frequencies of routine dental check.\n-\nSix-monthly routine dental checks or any other specific frequency of routine dental check for adults or children cannot be advocated on the basis of existing evidence.\n-\nThere is a need for further primary research to investigate the relative effectiveness of routine dental checks of different frequency in terms of the separate impact on caries, periodontal disease, oral cancer and patient-centred oral health outcomes.\nAbstract\nAims To systematically review the effectiveness of routine dental checks of different recall frequencies in adults and children.\nMethods Search methods included electronic bibliographic databases up to March 2001, relevant internet sites, citation checking and contact with experts and professional dental bodies. Inclusion criteria: (1) Study design: any; (2) Population: deciduous, mixed and permanent dentition; (3) Intervention: 'Routine dental check': 'clinical examination, advice, charting (including monitoring of periodontal status) and report' as defined in the NHS Executive General Dental Service Statement of Dental Remuneration; (4) Comparator: no routine dental check or routine dental check(s) of different recall frequency; (5) Primary outcomes: caries, periodontal disease, quality of life, oral cancer.\nResults Twenty eight studies were identified for the review. Studies were poorly reported and clinically heterogenous which restricted comparison between studies and limited generalisability to the UK situation. There was no consistency across multiple studies in the direction of effect of different dental check frequencies on measures of caries in deciduous mixed or permanent dentition, periodontal disease or oral cancer in permanent dentition. No studies were identified linking empirical measures of quality of life associated with oral health and dental check frequency.\nConclusions There is no existing high quality evidence to support or refute the practice of encouraging six-monthly dental checks in adults and children.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nOral health can be defined as a general state of well-being as a result of a healthy and functioning mucosae, gingivae and dentition. General oral health is improving in most industrial countries in both children and adults.1,2 In the UK, despite an increasing incidence of oral cancer in adults and static levels of periodontal disease in children there has been a marked observed improvement in general oral health (experience of periodontal disease, caries and tooth loss in adults and caries in children) over the past three decades.3,4,5,6,7 However important variations in oral health exist, reflecting a complex interaction of modifying factors for the development and management of oral disease. These modifying factors include age, diet, socio-economic status, ethnicity, tobacco use, fluoride use, dental attendance and clinician performance.8,9,10,11,12,13\nSix-monthly dental checks have been customary in the General Dental Service in the United Kingdom since the inception of the NHS. NHS regulations recognise this practice and although the NHS does not explicitly recommend a specific dental check recall frequency, current remuneration policy provides incentives for regular recall of individuals. Dental practitioners can be remunerated for performing six-monthly checks14 and registration with an NHS dentist lapses with greater than a 15-month gap between visits.15\nThe improvement in oral health, accompanied by a greater understanding of risk factors for disease progression, has raised the question whether dental check recall intervals should be adjusted to reflect current oral health needs more closely in order to optimise the clinical and cost-effectiveness of dental checks.9,10,11,16 Most debate has focused on whether the traditional practice of a six-monthly 'blanket' recall which currently exists in the UK should be lengthened.\nPossible disadvantages of lengthening recall intervals include moving away from a preventative approach resulting in more serious sequelae of caries (bigger restorations and an increased number of extractions) and a loss of opportunity to arrest the development of periodontal disease by encouraging improved personal oral hygiene and initiating appropriate treatment.10 There may also be risks to the development of patient-professional rapport and a loss of the potential for positive behaviour change, (advice on smoking and diet) that dentist\u2013patient encounters provide. Possible advantages of lengthening recall intervals are a reduction in costs for both patients and the NHS and a reduction in inappropriate treatment \u2014 (mainly fewer numbers of fillings) as a result of allowing the natural arrest or regression of caries lesions in enamel and less exposure of patients to unreliable diagnosis of caries.9,15\nResearchers have attempted to define an optimal (cost-effective) dental check recall frequency in caries based on bitewing radiological diagnosis of caries and modelling of average disease progression,8,12,17 restoration therapy longevity8 and risk of caries.13\nA number of reviews have considered the effectiveness of dental checks of differing frequencies9,10 but none of these have been conducted using systematic methods and therefore likely to be subject to bias and not to be comprehensive. Therefore it remains uncertain as to what might be the optimal recall frequency for clinical examination for multiple types of oral disease, in deciduous, mixed and permanent dentition and taking into account a range of modifying factors for disease progression.\nThis review aims to systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of routine dental checks in adults and children; specifically whether effectiveness is altered by the frequency of the dental check interval.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nA number of electronic bibliographic databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE; EMBASE and the National Research Register) were searched for randomised/non\u2013randomised controlled trials and observational studies. The search took place up to March 2001 and there were no restrictions by language. Search terms included various configurations of a range of text words eg dental visits, dental frequency, dental recall and the MESH terms preventive dentistry, dental caries, tooth diseases and oral health. Search filters (ie pre-defined groupings of text and MeSH terms) to identify trials, cohort and case control studies were included where appropriate.\nCitation lists from included references were examined in order to identify additional relevant studies. In addition we contacted experts directly and via relevant internet sites. These included the Faculties of General Dental Practitioners and Dental Surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons, England, the Scottish Dental Practice Board, the Dental Practice Board for England and Wales, (Eastbourne), the Central Services Agency, (Dental Information) Northern Ireland, Stakes National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health, Helsinki, Finland, the Dental Health Service Research Units at Sheffield and Dundee Universities and the Cochrane Oral Health Group specialised register of controlled trials.\nStudy selection\nIdentified studies were initially screened by one reviewer (CD) who excluded articles clearly of no relevance to the review. For remaining articles the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied by two independent reviewers (CD and KE).\nStudy design: Any comparative design.\nPopulation: Children (\u226418 years) and/or adults (\u226518 years) representing deciduous, mixed and permanent dentitions.\nIntervention: Routine dental check as defined by the NHS in its dental remuneration statement:14 'Clinical examination, advice, charting (including monitoring of periodontal status) and report'. In practice it proved impractical to strictly apply this criteria as studies invariably provided insufficient specific detail about the intervention. Studies were therefore included if the intervention was identified either as a 'dental check' or a 'dental check' followed by treatment initiated by the check.\nComparator: No routine dental check or routine dental check(s) of different frequency.\nOutcomes: Caries, tooth loss, periodontal disease, quality of life, oral cancer.\nGiven the change in the epidemiology of caries1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and in dental treatment practice10 (a previous greater emphasis on a restorative rather than a preventative care philosophy) in the developed world since 1980, studies were excluded if the data of data collection took place prior to this date.\nAssessment and reporting of study quality\nThe quality of included studies was assessed by one reviewer (CD) and for a random 50% of included studies by another reviewer independently (KE) using items from specific appraisal checklists appropriate to the study design ie controlled trial, cohort (prospective and retrospective), case control, cross sectional and case series.18 Some topic specific items were added to these checklists, for example measurement of oral health status at baseline and social class as a prompt to specific confounding variables.\nJudgements on the appropriateness of statistical analysis were further independently checked by a statistician (RT). Study quality was compared across studies using the categories of selection bias and confounding, external validity, performance bias, attrition bias and appropriateness of statistical analysis (Appendix 1). A conservative approach was taken and if a feature was not reported it was assumed to be absent. Where a study did not meet a quality criterion, a judgement was made as to whether this constituted a minor or major threat to the validity of the study. These judgements were based on the context of this review. For example, a study with a non randomised design allocating individuals to differing groups of dental check frequency which provided no evidence of balance in the baseline characteristics of the groups has the potential for considerable selection bias and therefore judged as a major threat to validity. On the other hand, given the nature of the outcomes being assessed in this review, a study without blinding of outcome assessment would be unlikely to be a major source of assessment bias and therefore judged to be a minor threat to validity. This process was undertaken by two reviewers (CD and RT) independently.\nData extraction\nData extraction was undertaken using a pre-designed data extraction form by one reviewer (CD) and for a random 50% of included studies by another reviewer independently (KE). Where information was missing or further clarity was needed, authors were contacted (100% of studies). Replies were received from five out of a total of 24 authors.\nTo ensure continuity, one reviewer (CD) was responsible for the initial screening of abstracts, selecting papers based on the review inclusion/exclusion criteria, assessing the quality of included papers and making judgements about potential threats to validity. Overall agreement between independent reviewers (CD, KE and RT) for study inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction was good (at least 70%) and all disagreements were resolved by discussion without recourse to a third party.\nData synthesis\nData synthesis using meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the marked heterogeneity between studies arising most importantly from apparent differences in the intervention under investigation, poor quality of reporting and the wide range of outcome measures used for each of the primary outcomes being considered by the review (Table 1).\nInstead a method of vote-counting was employed \u2014 the results of each study were summarised as either positive: a study that reports a statistically significant (ie P \u2264 0.05) increase in outcome with a decrease in dental check frequency; negative: a study that reports a statistically significant decrease in outcome with a decrease in dental check frequency; or neutral: a study that reports a non statistically significant difference in outcome with a decrease in dental check frequency, fails to report a statistical significance or reports a bi-directional outcome.\nIn order to assess the impact of study quality on the findings a sensitivity analysis exercise was undertaken. Studies with one or more major threats to validity were excluded from the vote-counting exercise in order that the results of those studies least subject to bias and confounding could be considered alone (Table 3).\nResults\nNumber of studies\nA total of 2,596 potentially relevant citations and abstracts were initially identified of which 68 were formally assessed for inclusion. Twenty four papers reporting 28 studies were finally included in the analysis of which 25 reported outcomes relating to caries, nine reported outcomes relating to periodontal disease and two reported outcomes relating to oral cancer. No studies were identified investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and empirical measures of quality of life associated with oral health. Thirty eight studies were excluded on the basis of full publications. In 17 studies, dental checks were not the subject of the study; in three studies comparison groups were not subject to dental checks of different frequencies; in five studies the dental check offered to comparison groups was different in content (apart from frequency); in seven studies no primary or secondary review outcomes were reported; in five studies the date of data collection was prior to 1980 and one study was a descriptive review. Figure 1 summarises the selection and exclusion process.\nCharacteristics of included studies\nTable 1 outlines key characteristics of studies included in the review. Studies were generally poorly reported particularly with respect to details of the intervention under investigation.\nSix of the 28 studies were undertaken in a UK setting, 18 elsewhere in Europe and one each in Canada, the USA, Australia and Hong Kong.\nIn only two studies30,31 could it be assumed that the intervention under study was comparable specifically to the dental check as it currently applies in the UK and as outlined in the NHS Executive General Dental Service Statement of Remuneration. Seventeen studies investigated the relationship between long-term dental check behaviour pattern and oral health outcomes 19,20,23(a),(b),24,25,28,29,31,32,34,35,(a),(b),(c),36,38,39 and 12 studies investigated the relationship between recent dental check behaviour and oral health outcomes.21,22,23(c),26,27,30,31,33,37,40,41,42 Only 11 studies measured the intervention objectively either by following individuals prospectively or by retrospectively checking dental health records.23(a),(b),(c),28,30,33,34,37,40,41,42, Although outcomes were measured objectively in the majority of studies the type of outcome measure used varied considerably limiting comparison between studies. In one study30 the length of follow up was less than two years \u2014 a period that was judged inadequate for the outcomes (caries) being considered. 8,12,17\nQuality assessment\nIncluded studies comprised three controlled trials, three prospective cohort studies, three retrospective cohort studies, 17 cross sectional studies and two retrospective case series.\nTable 2 summarises the main threats to validity arising from the execution of studies and data analysis. The frequency of 'unknown' responses illustrates the extent of poor reporting in studies.\nThe major threat to validity identified in the studies in this review was associated with an imbalance in patient characteristics across comparison groups. In three studies23(a),(b),30 there was evidence of such imbalance and therefore considerable potential for confounding. In an additional six studies25,32,34,38,41,42 patient characteristics were not reported in enough detail to allow assessment of similarity between comparison groups at baseline. Although multivariate statistical methods can be used to adjust for differences in characteristics, none of the nine studies reported such methods.\nTwo studies33,42 reported losses to follow up in excess of 20% which was considered to introduce attrition bias to such a level that it may be associated with a major threat to validity.\nAlthough a number of studies failed to report outcome results using measures of variance, their methods of statistical analysis were appropriate and therefore not judged as a threat to validity. Similarly, the five studies which failed to report eligibility criteria may influence the external validity and generalisability of the study findings but do not pose a threat to internal validity.\nOverall 28/28 (100%) of studies were judged to have a minor or major threat to validity arising from selection bias and confounding, 11/28 (39%) arising from problems with external validity, 24/28 (86%) arising from performance bias, 5/28 (18%) arising from attrition bias and 18/28 (64%) arising from inappropriate statistical analysis. Ten of the total 28 included studies (36%) were judged to have a major threat to validity on the basis of one criterion or more.\nOutcomes\nTable 3 summarises the results of the 28 included studies reporting the relationship between decreasing dental check frequency and caries, periodontal disease and oral cancer. Tests of statistical significance were not performed and could not be calculated by the review team for all or part of the reported results of nine out of a total of 28 included studies.23(a),(b),(c),31,33,35,37,(a),(b),(c)\nCaries\nDeciduous dentition\nA total of three studies in deciduous dentition investigated the relationship between dental check frequency and the outcomes 'decayed teeth' and 'decay experience' (dmft). All studies were classed as 'neutral'; in other words the studies either demonstrated no significant association between dental check frequency and the outcome under investigation, did not report tests of statistical significance or demonstrated a statistically significant bi-directional effect. No studies were identified investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and the outcomes 'filled teeth' or 'missing teeth' in deciduous dentition.\nMixed deciduous and permanent dentition\nThree studies in mixed deciduous and permanent dentition investigating the relationship between decay and frequency of dental checks demonstrated conflicting results. Two studies were classified as 'neutral'. One study reported a significant increase in the number of deep cavities with a decrease in dental check frequency.\nOne study investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and fillings demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of fillings in individuals with dental check frequencies individualised by a dental practitioner on the basis of caries risk compared with individuals attending \u2265 every 12/12 under a blanket recall policy. One study reported no significant association between DMFT and frequency of dental checks. No studies were identified investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and the outcome 'missing teeth'.\nPermanent dentition\nFifteen studies investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and decay demonstrated conflicting results. Eight studies demonstrated a significant increase in decay with a decrease in dental check frequency whilst seven studies were classified as 'neutral'. No studies reported a decrease in decay with a decrease in dental check frequency.\nNine studies investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and filled teeth demonstrated conflicting results. Five studies reported a significant decrease in fillings with a decrease in dental check frequency whilst four studies were classified as 'neutral'. No studies reported an increase in fillings with a decrease in dental check frequency.\nSixteen studies investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and missing teeth in permanent dentition demonstrated conflicting results. Eight studies reported a significant increase in missing teeth with a decrease in dental check frequency whilst eight studies were classified as 'neutral'. No studies reported a decrease in missing teeth with a decrease in dental check frequency.\nEleven studies investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and DMFT produced conflicting results. Two studies reported a significant increase in DMFT with a decrease in dental check frequency, two studies reported a significant decrease in DMFT with a decrease in dental check frequency and seven studies were classified as 'neutral'.\nPeriodontal disease\nNo studies were identified investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and periodontal outcomes in deciduous and mixed dentition.\nSix studies investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and probing depth or presence of pockets produced conflicting results. Two studies demonstrated a significant increase in probing depth with a decrease in dental check frequency whilst four studies were classified as neutral. For the outcome measures bleeding, presence of plaque/calculus, bone score, gingivitis and periodontal health, all studies were classified as neutral.\nOral cancer\nTwo studies investigating the relationship between oral cancer and dental check frequency were classified as 'neutral'. One study demonstrated a significant relationship between time since last dental check and tumour size and stage at diagnosis but it remains unclear from the analysis as to whether there is a consistent (or linear) trend in outcome with decreasing dental check frequency. One study found no significant relationship between the presence or absence of a cancerous or pre-cancerous lesion at examination and time since last dental check (\u226412/12 to >12/12).\nSensitivity analysis\nIt is hypothesised from empirical research43 that studies of poor methodological quality would tend to overestimate the effect of an intervention ie would be more likely to result in either a significant increase or a significant decrease in outcome when comparing differing dental check frequencies. This did not appear to be the case for any of the primary outcomes being investigated in this review and therefore suggests that the results are robust to variations in the quality of included studies (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of routine dental checks of different recall frequencies in adults and children.\nTwenty eight studies met the inclusion criteria of this review.\nA single study investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and decay in mixed dentition demonstrated an increase in decay with a decrease in dental check frequency. A further single study investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and filled teeth in mixed dentition demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of fillings in individuals recalled for dental checks according to an assessment by a dental practitioner compared with individuals recalled at 12 monthly intervals. For all other caries outcomes there was no consistency in the direction of effect of outcomes across multiple studies with decreasing dental check frequency.\nWith the exception of studies investigating the effect of dental check frequency on probing depth or pockets, for all other periodontal outcomes the effect of changing dental check frequency was neutral.\nFor oral cancer outcomes two studies demonstrated that decreasing dental check frequency had a neutral effect.\nOn the basis of these results it can be concluded that there is no existing high quality evidence to support or refute the practice of encouraging six-monthly or any other specific frequency of dental check in adults and children. Furthermore, the included studies were poorly reported and clinically heterogenous which restricted between study comparison and limited generalisability to the UK situation.\nPotential limitations of the review\nQuality of evidence\nA major limitation of this review was the poor quality of evidence. There was a preponderance of studies of cross-sectional design which are particularly prone to selection bias and confounding.\nThe majority of data collection for studies included in the review occurred during the 1980s which will give rise to 'interference' when interpreting results due to the continuing decline in the incidence of caries since this date.\nThe evidence available to this review was also poorly reported. Inadequate description of patient characteristics and the intervention under study (the dental check) limits comparison between studies and may influence the synthesised results of these studies. Poor quality studies result in biases that may lead to overestimation of an intervention's benefit.43 However the fact that sensitivity analysis on study quality did not alter the pattern of results across the majority of outcomes under investigation suggests that variation in the quality of studies included in the review was not the primary reason for the general lack of consistency of outcomes observed across studies.\nDefinition of intervention\nEleven out of 28 studies restricted their measurement of dental check frequency to the most recent dental check attendance and only 11 studies measured the intervention objectively either by following individuals prospectively or by retrospectively checking dental health records. There is evidence of inaccuracies in individual reports of dental check attendance44 and recent dental check attendance may not be representative of past behaviour. This raises questions about the accuracy and representativeness of the frequencies purportedly under investigation. Similarly studies reporting dental check frequencies based on a population policy of offering dental checks of a certain frequency are not measuring the attendance behaviour of individuals.44\nComparison of the evidence reviewed with the current UK situation was limited. Only six of the studies included were conducted in the UK. There was a lack of information on access to and the content of the intervention under study and in only two studies30,31 could it be assumed that the intervention under study was comparable specifically to the dental check as it applies in the UK today and as outlined in the NHS Executive General Dental Service Statement of Remuneration. Differences in treatment practices occurring geographically and over time will in particular affect the outcome 'filled teeth' and outcomes associated with periodontal disease.\nSynthesis of evidence\nSynthesis of evidence in this review was restricted by clinical heterogeneity. Due to problems defining the intervention under study, the range of dental frequencies studied and the range of outcome measures used, the results were pooled using vote counting rather than meta-analysis. Vote counting has the limitation that it gives equal weight to studies regardless of their size and therefore potentially over- and underestimates the importance of small and large studies respectively. Pooling the results does not reflect important differences between studies whose results are being grouped such as the different frequencies being compared for each single outcome. For example in the investigation of caries in the permanent dentition, dental check frequencies across studies ranged from individuals attending for dental checks \u2265 every 6 months to individuals who had never had a dental check. It could be postulated that any effect of the frequency of dental checks on the outcomes measured may be restricted to specific re-call frequencies reflecting an individual's risk of oral disease. If it had been possible to take a dichotomous approach to sensitivity analysis and select studies on the basis of their similarities (eg similar dental check frequencies or those studies more applicable to the current UK situation) then a different pattern of results may have emerged. However given the range of the differences between studies (eg country of publication, study design chosen, intervention under study, population under study, outcome measures used) and the possible interaction between these characteristics, to adopt this approach would have been potentially misleading. The heterogeneity across studies further did not allow us to formally test for the presence of publication bias.\nFinally, despite our attempt to restrict studies to those representing more recent trends in treatment practice there will still be unknown variation amongst practitioners which will affect outcome measures; particularly with respect to the number of filled teeth and outcomes associated with periodontal disease. For this reason results described by the synthesis must be interpreted with caution.\nImplications of study for UK policy and to clinicians\nThere is lack of consistency in the direction of impact on outcomes in studies that have compared different frequencies of dental check.\nMoreover the majority of included studies (22/28) have been undertaken outside of the current NHS setting. Only two studies investigating the relationship between dental check frequency and caries included six months as a dental check frequency and all other studies investigated less frequent dental check frequencies.\nModernising NHS Dentistry \u2013 Implementing the NHS Plan15 was published in September 2000 It forms the dental agenda of the modernisation programme for the NHS. It sets out the intention to redesign the NHS around patients to deliver fast, accessible care. Concerning modernisation of working patterns, the document suggests that the idea that everyone should visit the dentist every six months is one which is due for review and that by lengthening or individualising dental examination recall intervals access to NHS dentistry could be widened to a greater number of people.\nThis review indicates that there is no high quality evidence to either support or refute the current practice of encouraging six-monthly dental checks in children and adults.\nImplications for future research\nIt is clear from this review that further primary research is required in order to assess the relative effectiveness of different frequencies of dental check in terms of the separate impact on caries, periodontal disease and oral cancer. Further, clinical outcome measures and methodological approaches to assessing the impact of dental interventions need to be developed. For example the use of a composite end-point such as DMFT has the potential limitation that it may fail to reflect true changes in the underlying individual variables of which it is composed. In addition the quality of design and reporting of future research should be improved with an increased emphasis on patient-centred oral health outcomes.\nHowever the review highlights the difficulties in evaluating public health interventions such as the provision of dental checks. The use of trials and randomisation in settings such as these can be problematic. For example it is difficult to separate the effectiveness of checks from any subsequent treatment offered and variations will exist in the way that dental checks and treatments are offered and performed. Improved use of the considerable amount of data collected routinely within the NHS dental care system provides one method for further research and evaluation in dentistry.\nReferences\nVehkalahti M, Tarkkonen L, Varsio S, et al.

      "text": "Rethinking How We Treat Thumb Sucking and Tongue Thrusting\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Habits like thumb sucking and tongue thrusting are major causes of pediatric malocclusion, including anterior open bites.\n- Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy (OMT) aims to correct tongue and lip posture to address the root cause of these habits.\n- Orthodontic appliances like palatal cribs are effective at physically blocking the habit.\n- Combining OMT with habit-breaking appliances can resolve complex cases that either approach might not fix alone.\n- The goal is not just to stop the habit, but to restore proper orofacial muscle function for long-term stability.\nThat gap. We all see it. The six-year-old comes in, and there it is\u2014that perfect little space between the front teeth, tailor-made for a thumb. Or a tongue. So we have the chat with the parents. Explain how that constant, gentle pressure is an orthodontic appliance in itself, just one that moves teeth the wrong way. The parents get it. They promise to work on it. Then they come back in six months, defeated. Of course they are.\nThey were tasked with stopping a subconscious drive. Impossible. So we move to the next step. The hardware. We put in a palatal crib, a habit-breaker. Basically a little cage to make the old, comforting habit feel weird and wrong [5]. And often, the thumb stays out. The bite might even start to close on its own. Victory.\nNEWSLETTER\nGet expert guidance and new breakthroughs in dentistry delivered straight to your inbox.\nBut what did we actually fix? Did we solve the real problem? Or did we just put a padlock on one of the symptoms? The literature keeps poking at this, telling us to look past the thumb and stare down the real powerhouse in the mouth. The tongue [6].\nMake no mistake. A thumb habit can wreck a palate [10]. That constant force warps the arch, shoves the incisors forward, and creates that signature open bite. Then there\u2019s the tongue thrust. An incorrect swallow. Instead of pressing up against the roof of the mouth, the tongue darts forward, pushing against the teeth[1].\nEvery time the child swallows. Hundreds, maybe thousands of times a day. A relentless little engine undoing our best work [6]. Sometimes these problems show up together, a one-two punch to the developing bite [3]. Our go-to solution, the appliance, is just a fence. A passive barrier. It gets in the way of the thumb.\nIt might give the tongue a poke, a reminder of where not to go [7] [8]. But it teaches nothing. It doesn\u2019t rewire the bad programming. It just blocks the behavior. What if the real issue isn\u2019t the habit itself, but the faulty wiring that causes it?\nThis is where the other camp comes in. Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy. OMT [2]. Think of it as physical therapy for the face. For the tongue. It\u2019s a series of exercises to retrain the muscles to do their job correctly. OMT works to get the mouth to a proper resting state. Lips closed. Teeth slightly apart. Tongue resting on the palate, not lolling around or pressing on the teeth. It\u2019s work.\nIt takes commitment from the kid, the parents, everyone [4]. But it targets the source code of the problem. Not just the error message on the screen. It\u2019s not about building a better fence. It\u2019s about teaching the muscles they don\u2019t need to climb in the first place. So which is it? The fast, mechanical fix or the slower, functional retraining?\nFor too long, we\u2019ve acted like this is an either/or choice. You get the appliance guy or the therapy gal. But the real story, especially when you dig into the case reports, is that it\u2019s not a choice at all [3]. Think about that kid. The one with the nasty open bite, a thumb that\u2019s practically glued in their mouth, and a tongue that shoves forward with every single swallow. An appliance like a palatal crib can be the emergency brake. It has to be. It physically stops the thumb habit, which is causing damage every single day [5].\nThat has to end. Immediately. But the tongue is still in there, doing its own dysfunctional dance. Once the thumb is out of the picture, the real work can begin. The OMT can now retrain that tongue, teach it a new place to rest, a correct way to swallow [2]. The appliance breaks the bad cycle. The therapy builds the good one. You need both.\nAnd really, it\u2019s just common sense, isn\u2019t it? [3] [9]. You stop the bleeding with the appliance. The immediate damage. Then you bring in the therapy to actually teach the muscles how to work right so the whole thing doesn\u2019t fall apart later. So it actually sticks. This whole thing shifts what our job is. We\u2019re not just \u201chabit police\u201d anymore. We have to look at the whole picture. The bones. The teeth. And the powerful muscles that are in a constant tug-of-war with them all day long.\nIt means picking up the phone and talking to an OMT specialist. It means asking a smarter question. We\u2019re so focused on, \u201cHow do we get the thumb out?\u201d The real question is, \u201cWhy is the tongue so out of whack in the first place?\u201d So forget picking sides. Appliance versus therapy. That\u2019s the wrong fight. We have to see the whole system. And we have to admit that a piece of wire can block a thumb. Sure. But it\u2019s not smart enough to tell a tongue where to go.\nReferences\n[1] Mason R. M. (2005). A retrospective and prospective view of orofacial myology.

      "text": "Why Whitening Doesn\u2019t Always Work: A Different Take on Tooth Stains\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Tooth discoloration is classified into three main types: extrinsic (surface), intrinsic (internal), and internalized (stains that have penetrated the tooth).\n- Common causes include diet (coffee, tea), medications (like tetracyclines), trauma to the tooth\u2019s nerve, and genetic or developmental conditions.\n- A 2024 study found that coffee\u2019s acidity and color intensity directly correlate with its ability to stain teeth.\n- Treatment options are tailored to the type of stain and range from non-invasive professional cleanings and bleaching to minimally invasive microabrasion and restorative options like veneers or crowns.\n- A single dark tooth is often the result of trauma that has caused the tooth\u2019s pulp (nerve) to die, requiring specialized treatment like internal bleaching.\nThe conversation usually starts the same way. A patient points to their smile in the mirror, looking frustrated. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything,\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cThe whitening toothpaste, the strips... nothing works.\u201d Then they ask the million-dollar question: \u201cWhat am I doing wrong?\u201d\nAnd I have to be the one to tell them they might not be doing anything wrong at all.\nThe entire dental world, and especially the consumer market, has pushed this idea that a bright smile is just a tube of whitening gel away. But it\u2019s not that simple. Not even close. We\u2019ve been trained to think of all tooth stains as one problem. A surface problem. Like a coffee spill on a white countertop\u2014just scrub it off [1].\nThese are what we call extrinsic stains. They live on the outside of the enamel, the tooth\u2019s hard, protective shell. They come from chromogens, the pigment compounds in things like coffee, tea, and red wine. Tannins in these drinks act like a primer, helping the pigments stick. A recent study really dug into this with coffee, showing how its acidity and color directly cause staining. So yes, your daily habit is part of the story. So is tobacco. So is just plain old plaque if you\u2019re not brushing well. For these extrinsic stains, a good professional cleaning and polishing can work wonders. Sometimes, professional bleaching\u2014either in-office or with take-home trays\u2014is the perfect fix. Simple.\nBut what happens when the stain isn\u2019t on the countertop? What happens when it\u2019s soaked into the granite itself? That\u2019s a whole different game. And it\u2019s where the real frustration begins.\nThe Inside Job: When Stains Come From Within\nA single dark tooth. Grayish, maybe a little brown. That\u2019s a different animal entirely. When we see that, we\u2019re not thinking about coffee. We\u2019re thinking about trauma.\nMaybe years ago, that tooth got knocked. The nerve inside, the pulp, died. As that tissue breaks down, blood pigments leak into the tooth\u2019s deeper layer, the dentin [4] [5]. The tooth is literally bleeding from the inside out. It\u2019s a classic sign of a dead tooth. Slapping whitening strips on the outside of it is like trying to paint over a water stain on the ceiling without fixing the leaky pipe. It\u2019s not going to work. The discoloration is coming from deep inside.\nThis is what we call an intrinsic stain. It\u2019s baked into the tooth\u2019s structure. And it has a lot of causes.\nOne of the most notorious is medication. We see it all the time in patients of a certain age\u2014the telltale gray or brown banding caused by tetracycline antibiotics they took as a child [2]. While their teeth were still forming, the drug became part of the tooth structure. It\u2019s permanent. Certain antihistamines can do it, too. This is why a medical history is one of the first things we ask about. It\u2019s not just paperwork; it\u2019s detective work.\nThen there are the stains that are there from the very beginning. Genetic conditions like amelogenesis imperfecta or dentinogenesis imperfecta mess with how enamel and dentin form, causing severe, built-in discoloration [3] [6]. Or there\u2019s fluorosis, from getting too much fluoride during childhood. In mild cases, it\u2019s just a few faint white spots. In severe cases, it can be brown pitting across the teeth.\nAnd finally, there\u2019s a tricky hybrid category: internalized stains. It starts as a simple extrinsic stain that finds its way into tiny cracks in the enamel. Over time, it seeps deeper and deeper until it becomes an intrinsic problem. It\u2019s stubborn. By the time the patient notices it, a simple polish won\u2019t touch it.\nThe Real Work: Diagnosis and Modern Solutions\nSo, you can see why \u201cjust whiten it\u201d isn\u2019t a real answer. The first and most important step is always a proper diagnosis. We have to figure out why the tooth is discolored. A 2024 survey showed that even dental specialists can have different approaches, which tells you how complex this is. There\u2019s no single playbook.\nThe process starts with a conversation and a close look. What color is the stain? Is it on every tooth or just one? Is it uniform, or is it banded? We combine that with your medical history, your diet, your habits. To get even more specific, we can use tools like a spectrophotometer, which digitally measures the exact shade of your tooth. No more guessing. This gives us a scientific baseline to track progress and make sure we\u2019re aiming for the right result.\nOnce we know what we\u2019re dealing with, we can talk solutions. Real ones.\nFor that single dark, traumatized tooth, we can do something called non-vital bleaching. We actually place the whitening agent inside the tooth to bleach it from the inside out [4]. For those superficial white or brown spots from mild fluorosis, a technique called microabrasion is fantastic. We use a special paste to gently polish away a microscopic layer of enamel, erasing the spot without damaging the tooth.\nFor the really tough intrinsic stains\u2014the tetracycline banding, the genetic issues\u2014bleaching often isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s when we move to restorative treatments. We can cover the stain. Composite bonding involves applying a tooth-colored resin directly to the tooth surface, sculpting it to mask the discoloration. It\u2019s a great, minimally invasive option.\nThe gold standard for a dramatic change is often porcelain veneers. These are super-thin, custom-made shells of ceramic that we bond to the front of the teeth. They let us completely redesign the color and shape of your smile. If a tooth is also structurally weak, a full-coverage crown might be the best bet, restoring its strength and its look at the same time.\nIt\u2019s a step-by-step process. Logical. The goal isn\u2019t just to make teeth \u201cwhiter.\u201d It\u2019s to understand the root cause of the discoloration and choose a treatment that actually solves the specific problem. So before you get discouraged by the latest whitening fad that didn\u2019t work, talk to a professional. The real solution starts with a good diagnosis. It\u2019s less about a magic potion and more about good dental detective work.\nReferences\n[1] Hattab, F. N., Qudeimat, M. A., & al-Rimawi, H. S. (1999). Dental discoloration: an overview.

      "text": "Invisalign & Clear Aligners: What We Really Know About How They Work\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Clear aligners use digitally planned, gentle force to move teeth.\n- They are effective for many cases but can be less predictable for complex rotations and vertical movements compared to braces.\n- Patients often report better periodontal health and quality of life with aligners.\n- Poor hygiene can lead to significant biofilm (bacteria and fungi) buildup on aligners.\n- Treatment success is highly dependent on patient compliance with wear time (20\u201322 hours/day).\nThe Promise and the Physics of Plastic\nThe patient comes in, photos on their phone, sold on the idea of clear aligners. They see an easy, invisible path to a perfect smile. No metal. No wires. Just a series of sleek plastic trays. And who can blame them? The marketing is brilliant. But our job is to look past the lifestyle ads and get to the physics of what\u2019s really happening in the mouth. How does a piece of thermoplastic actually move a tooth through bone?\nIt isn\u2019t magic. It\u2019s a carefully staged sequence of biomechanical forces. A 2023 review broke it down well: the system relies on 3D scanning and computer-aided design to map out every tiny step of the journey [2]. Each aligner is a physical printout of one of those steps, engineered to deliver a gentle, continuous push. Or a pull. It\u2019s all about controlled pressure. But the plastic tray alone can only do so much [4]. It\u2019s great at tipping teeth. For the more complex stuff\u2014the twisting, the pulling down, the uprighting\u2014we need more grip. That\u2019s where attachments come in. Those little composite buttons bonded to the teeth. They are the handles that give the plastic something to grab onto, allowing for forces that a simple tray could never apply.\nNEWSLETTER\nGet expert guidance and new breakthroughs in dentistry delivered straight to your inbox.\nSo while the aligners look simple, the system behind them is an intricate application of orthodontic principles, just delivered through a different medium [1]. The question for us has always been about translation. Does the elegant digital plan on the screen translate accurately to the complex biological reality in the patient\u2019s mouth?\nPredictability: Where Aligners Shine and Stumble\nThat\u2019s the million-dollar question. And the answer isn\u2019t a simple yes or no. It\u2019s a \u201csometimes.\u201d Early on, we relegated clear aligners to the simple stuff. Minor crowding. Closing a small gap. And for that, they worked beautifully. But the technology has evolved. Better materials, smarter software, a deeper understanding of how to use attachments. Now we\u2019re seeing them used for moderate, even some severe, cases of malocclusion\u2014crossbites, overbites, you name it [1]. We\u2019ve even seen case reports of their successful use in incredibly delicate situations, like with patients who have dentinogenesis imperfecta, where tooth structure is a major concern [3]. It shows the adaptability of the system. But we can\u2019t ignore the data that tells us to be cautious.\nA big meta-analysis found that while aligners hold their own in most scenarios, traditional braces still have an edge for certain difficult movements [9]. Think significant tooth rotations or major vertical changes, like pulling a tooth down into place. Fixed appliances are just more efficient at it. More predictable. A 2020 review confirmed that aligners are quite good at front-to-back and side-to-side movements [8]. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the best tool for every single job.\nThere are still limitations in handling really big vertical problems or severe crowding without some extra help [10]. The plastic is clever, but it still has to obey the laws of physics. We\u2019ve all seen the digital treatment plan that looks perfect, only to find the actual results tracking behind schedule because a stubborn canine refused to rotate. The art is knowing which movements the plastic can handle with grace and which ones will be a fight.\nThe Patient Factor: Beyond the Straight Smile\nThis might be the most important part of the entire conversation. We can analyze the biomechanics and debate the predictability all day, but treatment success ultimately comes down to the person wearing the appliance. And this is where clear aligners are a completely different animal. The biggest selling point is their removability. And from a clinical standpoint, this is a huge win for oral health. It\u2019s just easier to brush and floss. A randomized controlled trial showed significantly better periodontal health in aligner patients compared to those with fixed braces [5]. Another study found patients reported a higher quality of life. Less pain. Fewer social anxieties [7].\nThese are not small things. They matter. But that freedom is also the system\u2019s greatest weakness. The aligners only work when they are in the mouth. Twenty-two hours a day. Minimum. That requires a level of discipline not every patient possesses. The other side of the removability coin is hygiene. Of the aligner itself. Patients are told to keep them clean, but do they understand what we\u2019re trying to prevent? Biofilm. It\u2019s more than just plaque. It\u2019s a sticky, structured community of bacteria and fungi, like Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, that can set up a thriving colony on the aligner surface [6].\nIf the patient isn\u2019t cleaning them properly, they are essentially bathing their teeth in a pathogenic stew for 22 hours a day. So the conversation has to shift. It\u2019s not about which appliance is \u201cbetter.\u201d It\u2019s about which system of force delivery is right for the specific clinical goal, and which system of patient responsibility is right for the specific human being in the chair. The technology is impressive, but the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed.\nReferences\n[1] Alkadhimi, A., & Ahmed, F. (2023). Clear Aligner Orthodontics: What is the Evidence for their Efficacy?.

      "text": "How Is Gum Disease Treated? Your Guide to Periodontal Therapy\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) is the foundational non-surgical treatment for periodontitis.\n- The use of systemic and local antibiotics can offer moderate benefits but raises significant concerns about antibiotic resistance.\n- A 2021 study in mSphere found that periodontal treatment can increase antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in dental plaque.\n- Long-term success hinges on periodontal maintenance appointments every 3\u20134 months and diligent home care.\n- The connection between periodontitis and systemic diseases like diabetes and heart disease elevates the stakes of treatment.\nThere\u2019s a tension in modern periodontics that we don\u2019t talk about enough. A clinical paradox. We have our primary enemy in sight: a pathogenic biofilm that destroys the structures holding teeth in place. And we have our primary weapon: mechanical debridement. But when that\u2019s not enough, we reach for the big guns. Antibiotics. And here\u2019s the problem that keeps me up at night: the very tools we use to quell the infection might be breeding a more resilient, more dangerous monster for the future.\nA recent study in mSphere put a fine point on it [8]. Researchers looked at the dental plaque of patients before and after periodontal therapy\u2014specifically Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) combined with systemic antibiotics. What they found was unsettling. The treatment didn\u2019t just reduce the bad bacteria; it significantly increased the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in the plaque that remained. It\u2019s like we\u2019re winning a battle but arming the enemy for the next war.\nThis isn\u2019t just some academic thought experiment. This is happening in our operatories every day. We write a script for doxycycline or metronidazole, hoping to give our SRP a boost [1]. Or we place minocycline microspheres directly into a stubborn pocket, targeting the bacteria locally [6]. And according to clinical guidelines, this can provide a \u201cmoderate benefit\u201d [7]. But at what cost? We\u2019re contributing to a global public health crisis of antibiotic resistance, all while trying to save a few millimeters of periodontal attachment.\nIt forces us to ask a fundamental question. Are we just managing symptoms, or are we truly solving the problem? The answer, I think, is complicated. Because the problem isn\u2019t just the bacteria. It\u2019s the host.\nBack to Basics: The Mechanical War on Biofilm\nBefore we get lost in the debate over antibiotics, let\u2019s get back to what we know works. The cornerstone of it all. Scaling and Root Planing. SRP.\nLet\u2019s be clear about what this is. It is not a \u201cdeep cleaning.\u201d I hate that term. It sounds like something you do to your carpets. SRP is a therapeutic procedure. It\u2019s a mechanical and biological reset for the tooth\u2019s root environment. We\u2019re going below the gumline into those periodontal pockets\u2014the pathological space created by the disease\u2014and meticulously removing the calculus (tartar) and plaque that coat the root surfaces.\nThe scaling part is brute force. Scraping away the hardened deposits that harbor billions of bacteria. But the root planing is the finesse. We\u2019re smoothing the root to remove bacterial toxins and create a surface that is less friendly to new plaque and more inviting for the gums to reattach. It\u2019s about disrupting the organized chaos of the biofilm. We can\u2019t sterilize the pocket, and we shouldn\u2019t try. The goal is to shift the subgingival ecosystem from a disease state (dysbiosis) back toward a healthier, more balanced one.\nBut here\u2019s the unglamorous truth: SRP is only half the battle. Maybe less. The other half, the part that determines long-term success, happens at home. In the patient\u2019s bathroom. Twice a day with a toothbrush, once a day with floss or an interdental cleaner. It\u2019s a non-negotiable partnership. I can perform the most technically perfect SRP, but if the patient doesn\u2019t maintain meticulous oral hygiene, the pathogenic biofilm will be back in full force within weeks.\nThis is why patient education is so critical. We have to move past \u201cbrush and floss more.\u201d We have to explain the why. Periodontitis isn\u2019t just gum disease. It\u2019s bone loss. Your foundation, crumbling [5]. And that crumbling foundation doesn\u2019t just threaten your teeth; it opens a gateway for chronic inflammation to enter your entire system, impacting your risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and maybe even Alzheimer\u2019s [2]. When patients understand that, the toothbrush and floss become medical instruments, not just cosmetic tools.\nAfter the active phase of treatment, the work continues with periodontal maintenance every three to four months. Not a \u201cprophy.\u201d Not a simple polish. It\u2019s a targeted re-instrumentation of those at-risk areas to keep the biofilm in check. As one study put it, this routine follow-up is as important as the initial therapy itself for lasting success [4].\nWhen Deep Pockets Persist: The Debate Over a Bigger Hammer\nSo what happens when you\u2019ve done everything right? You\u2019ve performed a masterful SRP. Your patient has become a home-care superstar. But on re-evaluation, you still find deep pockets\u20145, 6, 7 millimeters\u2014that continue to bleed on probing. The numbers aren\u2019t budging. This is the gray zone. This is where the clinical debates get heated.\nDo we go back in and do it again? Or do we escalate? This is where those adjunctive therapies come back into play. The systemic antibiotics [1]. The locally delivered agents [6]. The 0.12% chlorhexidine rinses. And this is where that risk-benefit calculation gets very real. Are the few tenths of a millimeter of pocket reduction we might gain from a course of doxycycline worth the risk of fostering resistance? For a systemically healthy patient with localized deep pockets, I\u2019m increasingly skeptical. For a diabetic patient with generalized, persistent inflammation, the calculation might change. The systemic implications are too severe to ignore [2].\nIf non-surgical approaches truly fail, we have to consider surgery. This isn\u2019t a failure, but a different tool for a different job. We can do traditional resective surgery, where we actually trim the gum tissue to reduce the pocket depth, making the area easier for the patient to clean. Or, in the right circumstances, we can attempt regenerative surgery\u2014using membranes and bone grafts to try and rebuild the bone and ligament that the disease destroyed [4] [5]. These are powerful techniques, but they are invasive and not without their own risks and limitations.\nAnd then there\u2019s the periphery. The world of \u201cnatural\u201d remedies that patients are always asking about. Green tea extracts, herbal rinses, and other botanicals [3]. Some preliminary research shows they might have some anti-inflammatory or antibacterial properties. But the evidence is thin. Very thin. Are they harmful? Probably not. Are they a replacement for SRP, meticulous home care, and proven therapies? Not even close. They should never be used as a substitute for treatments backed by decades of science.\nThis brings us back full circle to the original dilemma. The future of periodontics probably doesn\u2019t lie in a stronger antibiotic or a more exotic mouthwash. It lies in a deeper understanding of the oral microbiome and finding smarter, more targeted ways to modulate it without the collateral damage of broad-spectrum antimicrobials.\nReferences\n[1] Moja, L., Zanichelli, V., Mertz, D., Gandra, S., Cappello, B., Cooke, G.

      "text": "Is Orthodontic Treatment Worth It for Adults? What the Research Says\n- Share via\n- Adults now make up roughly one in four orthodontic patients.\n- Research shows treatment significantly boosts adult self-esteem and quality of life.\n- Fixed braces may achieve better bite outcomes, but clear aligners often result in higher patient satisfaction.\n- The long-term benefits of adult orthodontics include improved dental function and stability.\n- An adult\u2019s motivation and cooperation are key predictors of a successful outcome.\nMore Than Just Straight Teeth\nIt\u2019s a familiar conversation in the clinic. The adult patient points to a slightly crooked lower incisor. They want it fixed. They want it straight. But they absolutely do not want a mouth full of metal. So we talk about aligners. We lay out the pros and cons. And we know, even as the words are coming out of our mouths, that we\u2019re navigating a fundamental conflict between the textbook ideal and the patient\u2019s reality. It used to be simpler. Orthodontics was for teenagers, and that was that. Now, one in four of our patients is an adult, and they come with a different set of expectations [1].\nFor a long time, there was a quiet skepticism in the profession about adult ortho. Was it just vanity? A mid-life crisis expressed through dentistry? The research, however, is pushing back on that cynicism. Studies now show significant, measurable improvements in self-esteem and quality of life for adults who go through treatment [2]. This isn\u2019t just about aesthetics. It\u2019s about reducing psychological distress and improving dental self-confidence [3]. These patients aren\u2019t just chasing a Hollywood smile; they\u2019re pursuing a genuine sense of well-being. And frankly, they are often our best patients. Motivated. Compliant. They show up for their appointments and do the work because they\u2019re invested [1] [6]. They know what they want. That clarity is a double-edged sword, though. Because what they often want is the impossible: a perfect result with zero inconvenience.\nThe Appliance Tug-of-War\nThis is where the real debate begins. Brackets versus aligners. It\u2019s the central tug-of-war in modern adult orthodontics. On one side, we have the fixed appliances\u2014the traditional brackets and wires. A 2020 systematic review spelled it out pretty clearly: if you\u2019re chasing the best possible occlusal outcome, fixed appliances still have the edge [7]. Occlusion. It\u2019s a clinical-sounding word for something very basic: how your top and bottom teeth meet when you bite down. A good occlusion distributes forces evenly, protects the joints, and provides long-term stability. It\u2019s the architectural foundation of a healthy smile. So from a purely mechanical standpoint, braces give us more control to achieve that ideal.\nBut then you have the patient\u2019s side of the story. And it\u2019s a compelling one. A 2024 study found that while both braces and Invisalign effectively align teeth, the Invisalign patients reported much higher levels of satisfaction [8]. No surprise there. Aligners are more comfortable. They\u2019re nearly invisible. You can take them out to eat and clean your teeth properly. They fit into an adult\u2019s professional and social life in a way that brackets often don\u2019t. So here\u2019s the puzzle we have to solve every day: do we push for the technically superior bite, or do we prioritize the patient experience that leads to a happier, more compliant person? What about other options, like lingual braces hidden on the back of the teeth? The evidence for them is still considered weak, with nagging concerns about speech problems and tongue comfort [4]. They remain a niche solution for a reason. Advancements in bracket design are constant, of course, but they don\u2019t solve the core aesthetic objection that many adults have [5].\nRedefining the Finish Line\nSo, what does success actually look like? If we\u2019re being honest, the marketing has gotten ahead of the science. We promise life-changing smiles, but a sober 2023 review concluded that orthodontic treatment has \u201cmoderately positive effects on smile attractiveness\u201d [9]. Moderately positive. That\u2019s a humbling phrase. It pulls us back to reality. Perhaps the goal isn\u2019t a flawless smile ready for a magazine cover. Perhaps the real win is something more durable. The benefits of good orthodontic treatment have been shown to last, with lasting improvements in how teeth function together for years after the appliances come off [10]. That\u2019s a tangible health benefit, not just a cosmetic one.\nThis forces us to rethink the finish line. Maybe it\u2019s not about achieving the perfect occlusal scheme that will get nods of approval at a dental conference. Maybe success is a functional, stable, and healthy improvement that the patient is genuinely happy with. It means our most important job isn\u2019t just bonding brackets or delivering aligners. It\u2019s managing expectations. It\u2019s having a frank conversation about the trade-offs between the \u201cperfect\u201d clinical result and the \u201cbest\u201d real-world result for that specific person. The final measure of success isn\u2019t just in the post-treatment panoramic X-ray. It\u2019s in how the patient feels, functions, and lives with their new smile, years down the road. That\u2019s the only outcome that really matters.\nReferences\n[1] Nattrass, C., & Sandy, J. R. (1995). Adult orthodontics--a review.

      "text": "Managing Dental Pain: When to Use NSAIDs, Opioids, or Something More\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) and acetaminophen are the first-line treatment for acute dental pain.\n- Opioids are only for rare cases where first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated.\n- Not all \u201ctooth pain\u201d comes from teeth; it can be caused by TMD, headaches, or nerve issues.\n- Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary root canals or extractions.\n- Atypical Odontalgia is chronic tooth pain with no clear dental cause and requires specialized management.\nIs It Even a Toothache? The Diagnostic Challenge\nPatient\u2019s in the chair. Pointing. That one. The molar causing all the grief, keeping them up at night. You look. Gums look healthy. Tooth looks fine. The X-ray? Clean as a whistle.\nSo. Now what?\nThis is the moment. It\u2019s where routine dentistry stops and real diagnostics begin. It\u2019s also where bad assumptions lead to pulling a perfectly good tooth. For years, the conversation was easy. Pain? Here\u2019s a script. But that was just treating a symptom, and half the time, we were aiming at the wrong target. The hardest part of oral pain isn\u2019t picking the right drug. It\u2019s figuring out if the pain is actually coming from a tooth [3] [9].\nNEWSLETTER\nGet expert guidance and new breakthroughs in dentistry delivered straight to your inbox.\nYou have to ask. Every single time. Because getting it wrong is a big deal. It\u2019s how healthy teeth get unnecessary root canals. Or worse, pulled [9]. Then the patient still has their pain, but now they\u2019re also missing a tooth. For nothing. This isn\u2019t some rare story. It happens. We\u2019ve all seen cases where jaw muscle pain (TMJ), a headache, or some haywire nerve signal was just pretending to be a toothache [3]. Looking past the tooth isn\u2019t just a good idea. It\u2019s the whole job.\nThe New First Line of Defense\nOkay, but let\u2019s say we did the work. We\u2019ve tapped and tested and checked the films. It\u2019s a standard toothache. Cracked molar, post-op soreness, a deep cavity. What\u2019s the play?\nHere\u2019s where everything\u2019s changed. The whole script has flipped. The evidence is just too strong now, and the guidelines from the American Dental Association are blunt about it [2] [4] [6]. The opioid prescription pad is no longer the default. The first-line, go-to defense is a simple combination of non-opioids. We\u2019re talking NSAIDs and acetaminophen [1]. Ibuprofen. The stuff you get at a pharmacy.\nSounds too simple. I get it. Dental pain is brutal. How can plain old ibuprofen possibly be enough?\nBut the data doesn\u2019t lie. Study after study shows that NSAIDs, with or without acetaminophen, work better than opioids for most acute dental pain [2] [5]. They just do. Opioids just numb the brain. A cheap trick. NSAIDs? They go to the source. They knock down the inflammation that\u2019s screaming at the nerve. It\u2019s not masking. It\u2019s fixing. More targeted. More effective.\nSo when are opioids the right call? Almost never. The ADA guidelines are clear: only for the rare cases where NSAIDs don\u2019t work or a patient can\u2019t take them for medical reasons [4] [6]. And even then, it\u2019s the smallest dose for the shortest time, period. This isn\u2019t us being difficult. It\u2019s us being safe. It\u2019s about finally admitting we overused a dangerous tool for decades. This new way is just smarter medicine. It\u2019s the standard now. For everyone\u2014kids, teens, and adults [4] [6].\nAnd this needs to be the rule outside our offices, too. Patients with toothaches often land in urgent care first [8]. The advice for those docs is the same: use non-opioids and send them to a dentist. Immediately. Handing out painkillers without a dental exam is just kicking the can down the road [8].\nWhen the Pain Isn\u2019t Dental at All\nSo we\u2019re back to the messy one. The ghost pain. The patient is hurting, but the tooth is innocent. This is where we earn our keep. Is it the jaw joint? The sinuses? A migraine in disguise?\nOr is it something much weirder?\nWhich leads to the strangest diagnosis on the books: Atypical Odontalgia (AO) [7]. It\u2019s basically phantom tooth pain. A chronic, nagging ache in a spot where there\u2019s no dental problem. The tooth is fine. The bone is fine. But the pain is real [9]. It\u2019s what we land on after we\u2019ve ruled out everything else.\nAO is a monster. You don\u2019t fix it with a drill. You can\u2019t. In fact, doing dental work on it can make things worse. This is a medical problem now, not a dental one. It\u2019s treated as a neuropathic issue\u2014a problem with the nerves themselves. The treatment involves drugs that feel out of place in a dental chart, like certain antidepressants or anticonvulsants that can quiet down screaming nerves [7] [10]. There\u2019s no easy recipe, and a 2019 study confirmed it\u2019s all about a custom-fit approach and managing expectations [10].\nAnd that\u2019s the real story. Good pain management today isn\u2019t about having a strong prescription. It\u2019s about having a strong diagnostic process. It\u2019s about using simple, safe drugs first. It\u2019s about being humble enough to admit when the tooth everyone is blaming might not be the culprit at all. It\u2019s a huge shift in thinking, but it\u2019s a safer and better way to practice.\n[1] Brinkman, D. J., Brand, H. S., Rademacher, W. H. M., Bots, C. P., & Rozema, F. R. (2021).

      "text": "What to Expect During a Dental Extraction: Anxiety, Risks, and Recovery Tips\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- The primary reasons for tooth extraction in adults are severe dental caries and periodontal disease.\n- Studies show an 11% complication rate after extractions, with higher risks for smokers and patients with diabetes or hypertension.\n- For managing post-extraction pain, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) are proven to be more effective than opioids.\n- Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), derived from a patient\u2019s own blood, can significantly improve healing and reduce the risk of dry socket.\n- In children, socioeconomic factors like family economic hardship are strongly linked to the need for dental extractions under general anesthesia.\nTable of Contents\nExpectations\nOne in nine. That\u2019s roughly the chance of something going wrong after a tooth gets pulled [2]. That number\u2014about 11%\u2014comes from a 2025 hospital study, and it hangs in the air. For a procedure dentists do every single day, something so routine it\u2019s practically muscle memory, that isn\u2019t a trivial figure. It\u2019s a quiet reminder that pulling a tooth isn\u2019t a simple fix. It\u2019s an amputation. The end of a long, losing battle against disease. And for the person in the chair, it\u2019s never routine. It\u2019s the procedure they dread the most, tangled up in old stories about pain and a deep-seated fear of the dentist\u2019s chair [1].\nSo why does it come to this? The reasons are brutally consistent. It\u2019s almost always one of two things: runaway decay that\u2019s eaten the tooth from the inside out, or advanced gum disease that\u2019s destroyed the bone holding it in place [4] [8]. That gum disease, periodontitis, is a slow-motion disaster. The gums get angry, they pull back, and the tooth\u2019s foundation just crumbles. Some people seem to get a worse deal. Smokers. Men. They tend to lose more teeth [4]. It all points back to the same, frustrating truth. An extraction is a sign that prevention failed. That small problems were ignored until they became big, irreversible ones.\nThen comes the healing. Or the lack of it. The complication everyone\u2019s heard of is the dry socket. It\u2019s when the essential blood clot in the socket disappears, leaving raw bone and nerves exposed to the air. It\u2019s agony. But other things can go wrong, too. Bleeding that won\u2019t stop. Nerve damage [3]. The risk for all this isn\u2019t the same for everyone. It\u2019s higher if you smoke. It\u2019s higher if you have uncontrolled diabetes or high blood pressure [2]. The body is a connected system. A mouth isn\u2019t separate from the rest of it. An extraction isn\u2019t just a mechanical act; it\u2019s a biological event. A trauma. And sometimes, the body has trouble cleaning up the mess.\nSmarter Fixes for Pain and Healing\nFor the longest time, the playbook for pain was simple. Big procedure, big pain. That meant opioids. It seemed logical. But we were wrong. A huge 2023 review of studies blew that thinking up, confirming what a lot of us saw in practice: simple, over-the-counter NSAIDs\u2014think ibuprofen\u2014are better at controlling acute dental pain [9]. An NSAID combined with acetaminophen works better than an opioid. Better. And it doesn\u2019t bring along the baggage of addiction and heavy side effects. It\u2019s a massive course correction. With kids, the fix is even smarter. Give them pain medicine before you even start the procedure [5]. It heads the pain off at the pass. Simple. Effective.\nThat same spirit of \u201clet\u2019s work smarter, not harder\u201d is changing how we approach healing itself. The new tool here is platelet-rich fibrin, or PRF. It sounds high-tech, but it\u2019s beautifully simple. You take a little of the patient\u2019s own blood, spin it in a centrifuge for a few minutes, and you get this jello-like blob of concentrated healing goo. It\u2019s packed with the patient\u2019s own growth factors. You place that right in the empty socket. It\u2019s like giving the construction crew a perfect blueprint and all the best materials right at the start of the job.\nAnd it works. A 2025 analysis showed PRF makes the gums heal faster and\u2014this is the big one\u2014it seriously cuts the risk of getting a dry socket [7]. It\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s just smart biology. Using the body\u2019s own engine to prevent the most common and painful complication. It\u2019s a long way from the old days of just packing the hole with gauze and hoping for the best.\nThe Tooth Is Just the Beginning of the Story\nThe whole equation gets turned on its head when the patient is a little kid. You have a diseased baby tooth. Do you pull it, or do you try to save it with what\u2019s basically a baby root canal, a pulpectomy? The decision used to be about mechanics. Can it be saved? What\u2019s the cost? But that\u2019s the wrong way to look at it. A 2025 review\u2014even though it was based on just a couple of studies\u2014found something important. The kids who had the tooth-saving procedure had less anxiety. A better quality of life [6].\nThink about that. You\u2019re not just fixing a tooth; you\u2019re shaping a future adult\u2019s entire attitude toward their own health. One bad, scary extraction can create a lifetime of dental fear. Saving that tooth, even a baby tooth that will fall out anyway, can mean the difference between a kid who\u2019s okay with the dentist and an adult who avoids checkups for a decade. The tooth itself is temporary. The experience is permanent.\nThis is where you have to zoom out. Way out. And you see the problem isn\u2019t in the mouth at all. Why are some kids, often very young ones, having teeth pulled under general anesthesia in a hospital? A 2025 study from the UK connected the dots, and they don\u2019t lead to the candy aisle [10]. They lead to a family\u2019s front door. Kids were more likely to be in that operating room if their family was struggling with money. If a parent was using drugs. If another adult at home had a chronic illness. Suddenly, a child\u2019s cavity stops being about sugar and starts being about poverty. About stress. About a system that\u2019s failing them long before they ever sit in a dental chair. And you can\u2019t fix that with a pair of forceps.\nReferences\n[1] Astramskait\u0117, I., Po\u0161kevi\u010dius, L., & Juod\u017ebalys, G. (2016).

      "text": "How to Keep Your Braces and Teeth Clean\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Specialized brushing techniques reduce plaque buildup around braces by targeting hard-to-reach areas.\n- Poor hygiene during retainer use can undo orthodontic treatment results.\n- Clear aligners allow easier cleaning but still require strict hygiene habits.\n- Lingual braces pose unique cleaning challenges due to their tongue-side positioning.\n- Regular flossing and rinsing are essential to avoid gum inflammation and tooth decay during treatment.\nOrthodontic braces can transform your smile, but keeping your mouth clean while wearing them is no easy feat. Brackets and wires create countless tiny spaces where food particles and plaque can hide, making your regular brushing routine a bit more complex. Without proper care, the result can be gum inflammation, enamel decalcification, or even cavities.\nSo what\u2019s the best way to keep your teeth and gums healthy during orthodontic treatment? Let\u2019s break down the latest evidence on how to manage oral hygiene with braces effectively.\nTable of Contents\n- A Better Brushing Technique for Braces Wearers\n- Retainers Matter\u2014But Hygiene Still Counts\n- Braces vs. Aligners: Hygiene Challenges Differ\n- Supporting Evidence: Indirect but Important\n- Key Takeaways for Patients with Braces\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nA Better Brushing Technique for Braces Wearers\nIt\u2019s not just about more time \u2013 it\u2019s about better technique. A 2023 randomized controlled trial in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene tested a special brushing method for patients with orthodontic appliances. This method brushed at a 45 degree angle to the brackets and gumline using small circular motions. Compared to regular brushing, patients using the special method had less plaque buildup around the gums and between teeth [1].\nThe study was small but the design was solid. It proves that just brushing longer or harder isn\u2019t enough \u2013 you need to adjust your technique for your braces.\nRetainers Matter\u2014But Hygiene Still Counts\nEven after the brackets come off, your job isn\u2019t over. A 2023 Cochrane review showed that good oral hygiene during the retention phase (when you\u2019re wearing retainers to hold your teeth in place) is crucial\u2014the neglect of which can reverse months (or even years) of orthodontic work [2].\nWhile the review found limited high quality evidence on which retainer methods are best, the bottom line is clear: keep your retainer clean and continue your brushing and flossing routine is just as important post treatment.\nBraces vs. Aligners: Hygiene Challenges Differ\nIf you\u2019re still deciding between traditional braces and clear aligners, oral hygiene might be a deciding factor. A 2024 study in the Journal of Pharmacy & Bioallied Sciences found that patients with clear aligners had better hygiene outcomes. That\u2019s because aligners are removable so you can brush and floss without obstruction [5].\nBut aligners aren\u2019t a hygiene free pass. You\u2019ll still need to brush your teeth\u2014and the trays\u2014after every meal to avoid trapping bacteria and food debris.\nOn the other hand, lingual braces (which are on the back side of the teeth) present different challenges. A 2013 review showed that while lingual braces protect the front surface of your teeth, they make cleaning the tongue side more difficult [7]. This often requires even more elbow grease and specialized tools.\nSupporting Evidence: Indirect but Important\nOther research agrees: if you\u2019re wearing braces you must be extra careful with oral hygiene. A 2023 review in Cureus explains how the design of the brackets creates a perfect environment for bacteria if not cleaned properly [4].\nA 2001 article in Revue M\u00e9dicale de Bruxelles states that oral hygiene is key to orthodontic success regardless of age, whether you\u2019re a child or an adult [3].\nAnd a 2024 case report in Case Reports in Dentistry talks about using braces as a stabilizing splint for an avulsed (knocked-out) tooth. While oral hygiene wasn\u2019t the focus, it\u2019s a good reminder that braces are used for many things and in each of them cleanliness is key [6].\nKey Takeaways for Patients with Braces\n- Use a Special Brushing Technique: Brush at 45 degrees to the gumline and brackets. Short circular motions are better than side to side.\n- Don\u2019t Forget to Floss: Use floss threaders or water flossers to clean between teeth and under wires.\n- Consider an Electric Toothbrush: Many are designed for braces and can remove more plaque with less effort.\n- Rinse Often: Antibacterial mouthwashes help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that brushing misses.\n- Be Consistent: Brush after every meal and keep up with regular cleanings every 6 months\u2014or more often if recommended.\nFinal Thoughts\nBraces don\u2019t just move your teeth\u2014they raise the bar for how you take care of them. With wires and brackets creating extra crevices, plaque and bacteria have more places to hide. But research shows that with the right tools and technique\u2014plus a little consistency\u2014you can keep your mouth clean and your smile on track.\nSo whether you\u2019re in treatment or in retention, pay attention to your hygiene habits. Your future smile will thank you.\nReferences\n[1] Mei, L., Kang, A., Jin, C., & Farella, M. (2023).

      "text": "CAD/CAM: How Digital Technology Is Revolutionizing Dentistry\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- In-office CAD/CAM can make crowns and other restorations faster, but the learning curve is significant.\n- Digital workflows are revolutionizing complex procedures like implant placements and custom abutments.\n- Getting digitally-fabricated complete dentures to have good stability and retention remains a major clinical challenge.\n- Dental schools are now racing to integrate digital skills into their core curriculum.\n- The explosion of digital patient scans raises urgent, often overlooked, ethical questions about data privacy.\nYou know the pitch. You\u2019ve seen it a hundred times. The sleek machine, the happy patient, the perfect crown materialized in the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee. It\u2019s a great story. It just isn\u2019t the whole story.\nLet\u2019s be honest. The first time you hold one of those scanner wands, it feels like trying to park a bus in a keyhole. Getting a clean scan of a bleeding, distal margin on tooth #31 isn\u2019t in the training video. That part is on you to figure out. The promise of \u201cefficiency\u201d is there, sure, but it lives on the other side of a mountain of frustration and failed milling blocks [1].\nAnd here\u2019s the brutal truth about digital dentistry: it\u2019s unforgiving. A mediocre prep sent to the lab might come back looking okay because a great technician can work magic. A mediocre prep scanned into a CAD/CAM system is just a high-definition view of your own mediocrity [3]. The machine doesn\u2019t fix your mistakes. It just shows them to you in stunning detail. For years, the systems have gotten better and more integrated [2] [7]. But they still can\u2019t make up for bad dentistry.\nSo if single crowns are such a headache to master, what\u2019s the point? The point is what comes next.\nThink about implants. This is where the technology starts to feel less like a gimmick and more like a genuine revolution. You take a CBCT scan of the bone. You take a digital impression of the tissue. You merge them. Suddenly, you can design a custom abutment that perfectly sculpts the gums and supports a crown in a way a stock abutment never could [4]. It\u2019s predictable. It\u2019s precise. Some of the early academic papers on this were a bit thin, rightly calling for better long-term studies [6], but you can see the clinical advantage right there on the screen.\nBut then you get to complete dentures. And the wheels come off.\nThe promise is a fully digital workflow. The reality? Trying to get a stable impression of a loose, flabby ridge with a scanner is a nightmare. The technology struggles to capture the functional, movable nature of soft tissue, which is the whole ballgame for denture retention [9]. Can you print a pretty-looking denture? Yes. Will it have the fit and stability of one made from a masterfully taken analog impression? Probably not. Not yet, anyway [8].\nThe biggest challenges with this technology have nothing to do with the technology itself. They are human problems.\nThere\u2019s the training gap. New grads are coming out of school having barely touched alginate; they think in clicks and STL files [5]. Put them in a practice with a 30-year veteran, and you have two people speaking different languages. Who is right? Both. And neither. It\u2019s a genuine friction point in clinics everywhere.\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue that should make any practice owner lose sleep: data. What happens to that scan file after you hit \u2018send\u2019? Where does it live? Who has access to it? Is it secure? Every time you scan a patient, you are creating a detailed map of their anatomy and entrusting it to a third party. The profession has jumped headfirst into digital workflows without having a serious, collective conversation about the massive privacy and security implications [10]. It\u2019s a ticking time bomb.\nSo is the machine worth it? Yes, probably. You can\u2019t fight the future. But you have to go into it with eyes wide open, knowing that the slick machine in the corner is a demanding partner. It will challenge your skills, test your patience, and force you to be a better dentist. Just don\u2019t expect it to be easy.\nReferences\n[1] Ahmed K. E. (2018).

      "text": "Why People Delay Dental Visits, and What It Means for Their Health\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Over 71% of preschoolers with cavities experienced delays in care, averaging nearly 4 months [1].\n- Dental anxiety and low self-confidence\u2014not procrastination\u2014drive many treatment delays [3].\n- Living with supportive family members can reduce dental treatment delays in older adults [2].\n- Untreated dental infections can cause complications during cancer treatment [9].\n- Natural teeth, when preserved properly, can outlast dental implants in some cases [10].\nMissing or putting off dental appointments may seem harmless in the short term but over time those delays can have long term consequences \u2013 not just for your teeth but for your overall health. From cavities in toddlers to infections in cancer patients, understanding why people put off treatment is the first step to changing those habits. Research shows those delays are rarely about laziness \u2013 they\u2019re more often about cost, anxiety, lack of support and access barriers with lack of dental insurance or not being covered by a dental plan being a common reason for delay.\nTable of Contents\n- High Prevalence of Delayed Dental Treatment\n- Psychological and Social Drivers of Delay\n- Economic and Preventive Factors\n- Delayed Care Beyond the Dental Chair\n- Timeliness vs. Replacement: What\u2019s Better Long-Term?\n- Are We Overusing Antibiotics in Periodontics?\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nHigh Prevalence of Delayed Dental Treatment\nNEWSLETTER\nGet expert guidance and new breakthroughs in dentistry delivered straight to your inbox.\nDental delays are more common than you think. A 2025 cross-sectional study found that over 71% of preschoolers with cavities didn\u2019t get treated right away. The average delay? Nearly four months\u2014117.5 days [1]. Reasons ranged from financial hardship and logistical challenges to caregivers not knowing their child had a problem until it got worse. Dependents like children rely on caregivers to find the right dental care and meet the requirements for timely treatment.\nAnd it\u2019s not just kids. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly half of U.S. adults admitted to putting off dental care [4]. What\u2019s interesting is that urban residents\u2014despite having more dentists nearby\u2014were more likely to delay treatment than those in rural areas. That means it\u2019s not just about distance; stress, work schedules and transportation logistics may be just as big of a factor.\nPsychological and Social Drivers of Delay\nFear is a powerful barrier. A 2023 study found that dental anxiety and low self-efficacy\u2014the belief that one can\u2019t handle the stress or logistics of dental treatment\u2014were stronger predictors of delay than simple procrastination [3]. In plain terms, some people aren\u2019t avoiding the dentist because they don\u2019t care\u2014they\u2019re overwhelmed, nervous, or unsure how to take the first step.\nIn older adults, social support can make all the difference. Research from China on oral cancer patients found that those who lived with their adult children were less likely to delay treatment [2]. When people feel supported, they\u2019re more likely to seek care promptly.\nEconomic, Dental Insurance, and Preventive Factors\nWe hear all the time about the importance of early dental visits for kids but the data tells a more complicated story. A 2012 Medicaid study found no significant difference in outcomes between kids who had their first dental visit before 18 months and those who started later [5]. Early care is important but maybe not as early as some programs suggest. Dental benefits and dental coverage for kids are based on state Medicaid policies and kids have to qualify for these services according to specific criteria. That could help us target our prevention efforts more effectively.\nMeanwhile dental neglect\u2014intentional or not\u2014remains a big problem. States vary in how they provide dental services and preventive services to kids through Medicaid. A global review found 34-56% of kids and teens are affected by dental neglect [8]. Whether it\u2019s financial strain or caregivers not knowing the signs of dental disease, the takeaway is clear: education and access matter just as much as timing.\nDelayed Care Beyond the Dental Chair\nDental health doesn\u2019t exist in isolation. For patients undergoing cancer treatment, a minor dental issue can be life threatening. If a dental problem is left untreated it can complicate or delay cancer therapy. A 2018 systematic review found a high rate of untreated dental infections like pericoronitis in oncology patients [9]. These infections can delay or complicate chemotherapy and radiation. That\u2019s why cancer care teams are working more closely with dental professionals \u2013 often involving a dental practice to treat emerging oral health issues as they arise \u2013 to catch problems early and avoid preventable setbacks.\nTimeliness vs Replacement: What\u2019s Better Long Term?\nIf a tooth has been neglected for too long many people assume the only option is to extract and replace. But is that always the best choice? The goals of dental treatment should include both preserving natural teeth whenever possible and patient preferences for long term outcomes. A 2013 review compared long term outcomes of preserving compromised teeth vs replacing them with implants. Surprisingly well maintained natural teeth lasted longer than implants [10]. This finding supports the value of early conservative treatment \u2013 acting sooner means saving teeth rather than replacing them.\nAre We Overusing Antibiotics in Periodontics?\nNot directly related to delays but a 2022 Cochrane review on full-mouth disinfection for periodontitis brings up a related question: timing matters but so does method. Not all periodontitis cases need antibiotics and overtreatment should be avoided. Full-mouth treatment is meant to be aggressive but the evidence didn\u2019t show it was superior to step-by-step scaling and root planing [6]. It raises the question of overtreatment especially when antibiotics are involved.\nThis applies outside of dentistry too. A 2025 study on statin therapy in diabetic patients found that delays in preventive care even when not related to teeth led to worse outcomes [7]. The lesson applies across all medical disciplines: proactive care is better.\nClosing Thoughts\nDelaying dental care isn\u2019t about being lazy\u2014it\u2019s about fear, finances, logistics and sometimes just lack of information. What\u2019s clear is that delays are costly in dollars and in health. Fixing this requires a multi-faceted approach:\n- Build confidence: Education campaigns can reduce dental fear and increase self-efficacy.\n- Support families: Programs should empower caregivers to prioritize early and regular dental care for their kids.\n- Remove barriers: Policy changes that improve insurance coverage and transportation options can get patients to care when they need it.\n- Coordinate care: Especially for medically vulnerable populations oral health must be part of overall healthcare planning.\nTimely dental care doesn\u2019t just save smiles it saves overall health and quality of life.\nReferences\n[1] Huang, J., Sun, J., Ji, Y., Chen, C., Yang, Z., & Zhao, H.

      "text": "Clear Aligners vs Braces: What Dentists Say About Each of Them\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Clear aligners can effectively treat many mild to moderate alignment issues.\n- Fixed braces still provide better precision and bite correction in complex cases.\n- Patients using aligners consistently show better oral hygiene, with less plaque and gum inflammation.\n- The primary drivers for aligner popularity are aesthetics and comfort.\n- More research is needed to confirm the long-term stability of aligner outcomes compared to braces.\nThe Convenience Paradox\nIt\u2019s a conversation we have all the time now. A patient comes in, photos ready on their phone, asking for clear aligners. They want the straight teeth, but without the hardware, without the metal. And who can blame them? The marketing is brilliant, the aesthetic appeal is undeniable, and the promise of removability is a huge draw [5] [6]. But then we look at their case. The rotation on that canine. The posterior crossbite. The deep bite that needs serious correction. And the internal debate begins. We know what the gold standard is, what the most predictable path to a perfect result looks like. It often looks like brackets and wires.\nSo we\u2019re caught. Caught between the patient\u2019s very valid desire for a less invasive experience and our clinical understanding of biomechanics. The evidence confirms what we see in the chair: clear aligners work. For the right cases. We see studies pointing to clinically acceptable outcomes, especially for the mild to moderate stuff [8]. One 2024 paper even showed a 75% reduction in the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) index, which is a standardized way we score how well the teeth are straightened [1]. Sounds great. But the researchers themselves tagged that evidence as \u201cmoderate.\u201d Limited.\nNEWSLETTER\nGet expert guidance and new breakthroughs in dentistry delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe truth is, when things get complicated, the old-school tools still seem to have the edge. A big meta-analysis from 2020 was pretty direct about it: fixed braces give better results for the bite, for the final occlusion [2]. It\u2019s about control. That ability to apply specific forces in three dimensions to get teeth exactly where they need to go is just more refined with a bracket bonded to a tooth. With aligners, we\u2019re essentially pushing teeth with plastic. It\u2019s a remarkably effective push, but it has its limits. A 2019 review called them effective, but also pointed out their \u201cclinical limitations\u201d compared to conventional appliances [3] [4]. So the paradox remains. We have a technology that patients love, that gets decent results in many cases, but that may not be our best tool for the toughest jobs.\nHygiene vs. Mechanics: The Great Trade-Off\nThis is where the conversation gets really interesting. Because for years, the primary debate was purely mechanical: which tool moves teeth better? But now, we have a mountain of evidence on a different front. Oral hygiene. And here, it\u2019s not even a contest. The data is clear and consistent. Patients with clear aligners have healthier mouths during treatment. Period.\nSystematic reviews from 2021 and 2023 both landed on the same conclusion: aligner patients have less plaque buildup, less gingival inflammation, and better overall periodontal health [7] [10]. Periodontal health, meaning the health of the gums and bone that support the teeth. It\u2019s a huge deal. We\u2019ve all seen the patient with braces whose gums are swollen and bleeding after two years of struggling to brush and floss around all that hardware. We\u2019ve seen the white spot lesions\u2014the early signs of cavities\u2014that can appear around brackets. With aligners, the patient just pops them out. They brush. They floss. Like a normal person. Then they pop the aligners back in.\nThis presents a fundamental clinical question. What are we optimizing for? Are we chasing a textbook-perfect occlusion at the potential cost of the patient\u2019s gum health? Or is a very good, stable, and aesthetically pleasing result\u2014achieved with excellent oral hygiene\u2014a bigger win? There\u2019s no easy answer. It forces us to weigh the precision of fixed mechanics against the very real biological benefits of the removable system. It\u2019s a trade-off. We might get more precise root torque and better bite-settling with braces, but if the patient\u2019s gums are a mess by the end of it, what have we accomplished? It shifts the focus from a purely orthodontic outcome to a comprehensive oral health outcome.\nA New Definition of Success?\nSo where does this leave us? Not with a simple verdict that one is \u201cbetter\u201d than the other. It leaves us with a more nuanced approach to treatment planning and patient education. The rise of aligners hasn\u2019t just given us a new tool; it\u2019s forced us to reconsider our definition of a successful outcome. It\u2019s not just about the final position of the teeth anymore. It\u2019s about the entire treatment experience and the patient\u2019s health throughout the process.\nWe have to be honest about the limitations. Aligners aren\u2019t magic. They can\u2019t do everything, and trying to force them to can lead to frustration, extended treatment times, and subpar results. Other alternatives, like braces hidden on the back of the teeth, have an even weaker evidence base, so they aren\u2019t some secret solution either [9]. For complex movements and significant bite changes, fixed appliances are often still the most reliable horse in the race [2].\nBut for a huge swath of patients\u2014those with mild to moderate crowding or spacing\u2014aligners offer a fantastic option that delivers a great smile with a side of excellent oral hygiene [8] [9]. The key is case selection. Our job is to diagnose properly and set realistic expectations. To explain the trade-offs clearly. You can have this aesthetic, comfortable treatment, but the final bite might be 95% perfect instead of 100%. Or, you can have the brackets and wires, which give us more control to chase that last 5%, but you will have to work twice as hard to keep everything clean.\nUltimately, the choice is less about the appliance itself and more about the clinical judgment behind it. The goal isn\u2019t just straight teeth. It\u2019s healthy, stable, straight teeth in a patient who felt respected and involved in the process. That\u2019s the real finish line.\nReferences\n[1] Alam, M. K., Hajeer, M. Y., Alahmed, M. A., Alrubayan, S. M., & Almasri, M. F. (2024).

      "text": "Abstract\nHealthy teeth allow us to eat and stay well-nourished. Although primary care clinicians receive limited training about teeth, given the common nature of dental problems, it is important that they understand and recognize normal and abnormal dental conditions and can implement primary and secondary prevention of dental conditions in their practice. PubMed has been used to search the scientific literature for evidence on the following topics: normal dental development, dental abnormalities, malocclusion, teething, dental caries and related epidemiology and prevention, fluoride, dental injury and its management and prevention; and identification, prevention and treatment of gingivitis and periodontal disease. Literature review relied on randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and Cochrane reviews when relevant and available. Other sources of evidence included cohort and case-control studies. Consensus statements and expert opinion were used when there was a paucity of high-quality research studies. The literature has been synthesized on these topics to make them relevant to pediatric primary care clinicians, and as available, the strength of evidence has been characterized when making clinical recommendations.\nKeywords: Dental development, occlusion, non-nutritive sucking, malocclusion, teething, dental caries, fluoride, traumatic dental injuries, gingivitis, periodontal disease.\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jphd.12154] [PMID: 26992441]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pcl.2018.05.016] [PMID: 30213353]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2015-3501] [PMID: 26908659]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.105.4.747] [PMID: 10742315]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.1980.0183] [PMID: 6931159]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1067/moe.2001.115461] [PMID: 11505260]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003879.pub4] [PMID: 27578151]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/9378325] [PMID: 28401166]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476278.2017.1332554] [PMID: 28598258]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-0628] [PMID: 28557774]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-4160-6400-8.00016-X]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1964.03060280080021] [PMID: 14172262]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008694.pub2] [PMID: 25825863]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yapd.2017.03.011] [PMID: 28688595]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-7325.1999.tb03268.x] [PMID: 10649591]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cden.2019.06.002] [PMID: 31470917]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2017.04.013] [PMID: 28619207]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-7325.2012.00331.x] [PMID: 22515656]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2380084417751350] [PMID: 30931771]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4124-z] [PMID: 31068205]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146218] [PMID: 26751953]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2009.09.008] [PMID: 19945075]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6831-15-S1-S9] [PMID: 26391116]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000358333] [PMID: 24853115]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018-3499] [PMID: 31028158]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-7325.2009.00126.x] [PMID: 19453868]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.bdj.4808195] [PMID: 8518048]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/pir.35-1-3] [PMID: 24385561]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pcl.2018.05.014] [PMID: 30213354]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4587515] [PMID: 14781280]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.1956.0042] [PMID: 13294995]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12903-017-0433-y] [PMID: 29179712]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6831-15-9] [PMID: 25604625]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022034518774331] [PMID: 29900806]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1875-595X.2005.tb00045.x] [PMID: 16379137]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0528.2012.00708.x] [PMID: 22882502]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6804a3] [PMID: 30703075]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-7325.1992.tb02277.x] [PMID: 1512747]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0528.1998.tb01979.x] [PMID: 9870540]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000262111] [PMID: 8556745]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002279.pub2] [PMID: 23846772]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdoe.12320] [PMID: 28682498]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2015.06.018] [PMID: 26562737]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.18043/ncm.78.6.394] [PMID: 29203603]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000488686] [PMID: 29874642]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0839] [PMID: 27920311]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00784-017-2075-5] [PMID: 28303470]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000262352] [PMID: 8946097]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.2008.0102] [PMID: 19047666]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/ijdr.IJDR_307_16] [PMID: 30127194]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022034512449467] [PMID: 22899692]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022034517736500] [PMID: 29355423]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cre2.165] [PMID: 31049218]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csm.2016.12.001] [PMID: 28314423]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-3792] [PMID: 24470646]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/edt.12079] [PMID: 24118990]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/edt.12441] [PMID: 30222244]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.2006.0118] [PMID: 17138717]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/idj.12317] [PMID: 28646499]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.12366] [PMID: 25639826]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002281.pub3] [PMID: 24934383]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-051X.2004.00578.x] [PMID: 15367192]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S136898001400113X] [PMID: 24892213]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00016357609004651] [PMID: 1070906]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cden.2018.08.003] [PMID: 30447790]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.bdj.2016.257] [PMID: 27056513]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2015.10.014] [PMID: 26776927]\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010856.pub2] [PMID: 26092033]"

      "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nThis systematic review aims to update on the prevalence of odontogenic-related infections and the efficacy of dental strategies in preventing dental-related complications in cancer patients since the 2010 systematic review.\nReview method\nA literature search was conducted in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE for articles published between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2016. Each study was assessed by 2 reviewers and the body of evidence for each intervention was assigned an evidence level.\nResults\nAfter examination of the abstracts and full-text articles, 59 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria. The weighted prevalence of dental infections and pericoronitis during cancer therapy was 5.4 and 5.3%, respectively. The frequency of dental-related infections during intensive chemotherapy after complete, partial, and minimal pre-cancer dental evaluation/treatment protocols ranged from 0 to 4%. Protocols involving third molars extractions had the highest complications (40%).\nConclusions\nIn view of the low prevalence of infections and the potential for complications after third molar extractions, it is suggested that partial dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to intensive chemotherapy; whereby minor caries (within dentin), asymptomatic third molars or asymptomatic teeth without excessive probing depth (<8 mm), mobility (mobility I or II) or with periapical lesions of <5 mm were observed; is a viable option when there is insufficient time for complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols. The use of chlorhexidine, fluoride mouth rinses as well as composite resin, resin-modified glass ionomer cement (GIC), and amalgam restorations over conventional GIC in post head and neck radiation patients who are compliant fluoride users is recommended.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nIntroduction\nSignificant advancement has been made in the field of cancer treatment and the increasingly affordable field of genetic deep sequencing has offered unprecedented insight into the biology of cancers. With the advent of precision medicine, targeted therapy with new chemotherapeutic agents targeting specific biology of cancers is becoming more widely available [1]. Despite these advances, surgical resection, radio-, and chemotherapy remain the main modalities of cancer management. Although effective in treating the cancer, these treatment modalities may cause significant morbidity from direct damage to the head and neck structures and indirect effects from systemic toxicity [2]. Specific to the dental apparatus, the increased risk for development of rampant decay post head and neck radiation is well documented. Additionally, high restoration failure is another problem frequently encountered in this population. Both are direct consequences of the loss of protection from saliva due to salivary gland damage by high dose head and neck radiation. In this review, we seek to update findings from our previous publication in 2010, whereby conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC) restorations was reported to perform poorest compared to other materials (resin modified GIC, composite resin, and amalgam) in patients post head and neck radiation [3]. This recommendation was based on three relatively old studies; and with rapid advancement in material technology; this may no longer be valid.\nAnother common concern in patients undergoing intensive anti-neoplastic chemotherapy is the risk of infections from odontogenic sources. Even though the prevalence of dental infections during chemotherapy has been reported to be relatively low (5.9%), the consequence from an infection in a severely pancytopenia patient is potentially serious [3,4,5]. Hence, many cancer centers mandate that all patients undergo a pre-cancer dental evaluation prior to initiation of anti-neoplastic chemotherapy [6, 7]. In 2010, Hong et al. reported that there were only two studies on the various dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to cancer therapy and no recommendations could be made due to a lack of data from clinical trials to support or refute a specific protocol [3].\nSince the 2010 systematic review, new studies have been published on pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols and restorative strategies in cancer patients. The aims of this review were to update current understanding with regard to the (1) prevalence of infections from odontogenic sources in patients undergoing cancer therapy, (2) efficacy of pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols in preventing complications, (3) dental disease management strategies, and (4) changes in the dental-related oral microorganisms associated with cancer treatment.\nMaterials and methods\nLiterature search\nA literature search was conducted with assistance from a research librarian using the electronic databases of PubMed and EMBASE for articles published between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2016. This is detailed in Fig. 1. As the previous publication by our group had addressed the dental disease and the management strategies in cancer patients [3], this review reports these aspects from relevant articles published since January 2009, namely from the end of the literature search of our previous publication while combining current findings with the previous articles. Electronic database searches were performed using different combinations of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms: \u201cdental caries,\u201d \u201cperiodontal disease,\u201d \u201ccancer,\u201d \u201ccancer therapy,\u201d \u201cradiotherapy,\u201d \u201canti-neoplastic agents,\u201d and \u201ctotal body irradiation\u201d for the literature search.\nEligibility criteria\nOnly English language articles were included. The inclusion criteria were (1) studies assessing dental disease in patients undergoing cancer therapy, (2) studies performed in cancer patients of all age groups, (3) studies published in peer reviewed journals. The exclusion criteria were systematic or narrative reviews, opinion papers, case reports, abstracts, and animal model and/ or in-vitro studies. The studies evaluating dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to head and neck radiation were also excluded because the considerations for these patients are their life-long risk for osteoradionecrosis; rather than the risk of immunosuppression and life threatening bloodstream infections in those undergoing intensive anti-neoplastic chemotherapy [8, 9].\nReview tools, selection of studies, and data extraction\nFor the purpose of this study, an electronic form was composed which included multiple coded answers and space for free text, covering the following items: (1) reviewer and manuscript details, (2) oral involvement, (3) intervention details, (4) study aim and design, (5) study groups and sites, (6) demographics, (7) cancer type, (8) percentage of individuals or clusters who refused to participate or were lost to follow-up, (9) inclusion criteria, (10) dental disease assessment, (11) confounding factors, (12) outcome measures, (13) pain, (14) quality of life, (15) pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols, (16) changes in cariogenic and periodontal organisms, (17) main findings, (18) conclusion, (19) flaws, and (20) Level of evidence.\nEach study was independently evaluated by two reviewers with a standard electronic collection form customized for reviewing dental disease data. Reviewers were recruited from the membership of the Oral Care Study Group, MASCC/ISOO. The utilization of the electronic form was standardized within the reviewers by a written manual, teleconferences, and a calibration exercise. For the calibration phase, each individual reviewer reviewed one paper [10]. For the review phase, articles were assigned to each pair of reviewers in alphabetic order. Any discrepancy in inclusion of a study was resolved by the section head (CH). Once the electronic forms were completed by the reviewers, the forms were sent to the section head who compared the reviews, assessed discrepancies between the reviewers based on the publication, reviewed the publications to resolve any inter-reviewer inconsistencies and concentrated the data.\nStudies were scored for their Level of Evidence based on the Somerfield criteria [11] and flaws were listed according to the Hadorn criteria [12]. A well-designed study was defined as a study with no major flaws per the Hadorn criteria [12]. Tertiary reviews were completed by the section head and a final section head template was devised for the summary of all publications.\nFindings from the reviewed studies were integrated into guidelines based on the overall Level of Evidence for each intervention. Guidelines were classified into three types: recommendation, suggestion, or no guideline possible.\nResults\nThe electronic searches identified over a thousand titles and abstracts. After examination of the abstracts and full-text articles by the review group, 59 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1).\nInfections from odontogenic sources during cancer therapy\nDental related infections/abscess during cancer therapy (largely anti-neoplastic chemotherapy) was reported in six studies [13,14,15,16,17,18] including those from the 2010 systematic review. The mean weighted prevalence was 5.4% (standard of error 1.16, 95%, confidence interval 3.14\u20137.7), Exclusion of studies whereby patients were not completely eliminated of all active and chronic foci of infections prior to cancer therapy did not appreciably change the prevalence.\nThe mean weighted prevalence of pericoronitis during cancer therapy (Baliga et al. [14]: anti-neoplastic chemotherapy; Fayle et al. [15]: cancer therapy not defined) from both studies [14, 15] was 5.3% (standard of error 2.35, 95% confidence interval 0.65\u20139.85).\nPre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols\nThere were a total of 11 studies (from 2010 and current review) that evaluated different types of dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to anti-neoplastic chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) (Table 1). Expectedly, there were no randomized controlled trials due to ethical concerns with assigning patients undergoing cancer therapy to be in the no dental evaluation/treatment group.\nThe types of pre cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols was broadly categorized to either (i) complete protocols which involved treatment of all dental pathology prior to initiation of anti-neoplastic chemotherapy and HSCT [19,20,21], (ii) partial protocols which differed from complete protocols in that (a) minor dental caries (Yamagata et al. [25, 26]: not defined, Tsuji et al. [24]: within dentin) were not treated and observed, (b) teeth with apical periodontitis were only managed if symptomatic and if size of the periapical lesion was \u22655 mm, (c) only teeth with severe periodontitis (though the definition of advanced disease varied between studies) were extracted; the threshold for extraction of these teeth was if they had probing depth of \u22658 mm (rather than 6 mm in complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols) and/ or with mobility III, (d) extraction of severely mobile deciduous teeth that were expected to exfoliate within a few weeks (rather than 50% root resorption in complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols), and (e) extraction of partially erupted symptomatic third molars with purulence (versus extraction of partially erupted third molars in complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols), and lastly (iii) minimal protocols included protocols whereby treatment was only administered if the patient was symptomatic or if patient was either not evaluated/treated due to time restraints and/ or did not complete dental treatment. A side by side comparison of the three types of pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols is detailed in Table 2.\nMelkos et al. and Tsuji et al. evaluated patients who underwent complete or partial pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols versus those who did not complete or go through dental treatment prior to anti-neoplastic chemotherapy [21, 24]. Melkos et al. found no odontogenic sources of infection in both patients who underwent complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols versus those who did not prior to HSCT [21]. Additionally, the authors found no association between the presence of dental foci of infection and HSCT complications or survival rate [21]. Tsuji et al. reported that patients who completed the partial pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocol had significantly (p <0.05) lower incidence of systemic (15.8 versus 37.4%) and dental complications (2.9 versus 34.0%) when compared to patients who did not complete any pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment [24]. The dental complications reported by Tsuji et al. included redness, warmth, swelling, pus discharge, and pain in and around the teeth or periodontium [24]. These complications were significantly more frequent in chemotherapy regimens associated with a higher degree of myelosuppression [24]. The dental protocol used in the Tsuji et al. study [24] was modified from earlier studies by Yamagata et al. [25, 26]; who also found no odontogenic infections occurred in both pediatric and adult HSCTs.\nThere have been two studies on minimal pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocol whereby only acute dental pathologies were treated prior to intensive anti-neoplastic chemotherapy [16, 18]. In Toljanic et al. study, two patients (10%) with severe chronic dental pathology had febrile episodes due to odontogenic sources; while patients classified as having mild or moderate chronic dental pathology did not develop any odontogenic related complications during anti-neoplastic chemotherapy [16]. Similar to the findings in Toljanic\u2019s study [16], the prevalence of exacerbation of chronic oral foci during anti-neoplastic chemotherapy in Schuurhuis et al. study [18] was 4% (3% of total sample). In addition, Schuurhuis et al. found no difference between patients with or without chronic oral foci of infection/s and those with treated acute oral foci of infection/s with regards to the duration of neutropenia and fever [18].\n-\n(i)\nComplications from dental evaluation/treatment protocols\nThree studies reported the frequency of complications after dental treatment in cancer patients [20, 22, 23]. In a retrospective cohort study of patients with hematological cancers, 9 (13%) patients developed complications post extractions performed during pre-cancer dental evaluation/treatment resulting in delays in initiation of chemotherapy and the need for platelet transfusion due to post extraction bleeding [22]. Haytac et al. reported two (3%) patients with hematological cancers whereby anti-neoplastic chemotherapy initiation was postponed due to delayed wound healing after extractions [20]. In Tai et al. study, a high proportion of patients (40%) who had third molar (symptomatic) extractions developed post-operative complications (e.g., bleeding, trismus, infections etc.). However, the timing of extractions in relation to the patients\u2019 timing of cancer therapy (before or during) and the type of cancer therapy was not specified in this study [23].\n-\n(ii)\nManagement of third molars\nIn the studies by Yamagata et al. and Melkos et al., no odontogenic infections were associated with the asymptomatic or semi-impacted third molars during HSCT [21, 27]. However, Tai et al. found that 16 (64%) patients with symptomatic third molars only became symptomatic during cancer therapy (cancer modality not specified) [23].\n-\n(iii)\nPeriodontal therapy\nThe initiation of periodontal therapy before, during and after head and neck radiation and anti-neoplastic chemotherapy resulted in improvements in periodontal health in cancer patients [8, 19]. However, G\u00fcrgan et al. reported that the improvement in periodontal parameters did not influence medical outcomes in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing anti-neoplastic chemotherapy (e.g., engraftment period, duration of febrile neutropenia) [19]. Additionally, if the initial therapy at the time of pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment was not followed with periodontal maintenance, periodontal disease continued to progress in post head and neck radiation patients [9].\nSummary and recommendation\n-\n1.\nSuggest that partial dental evaluation/treatment protocols whereby minor caries, asymptomatic third molars, asymptomatic teeth with periapical periodontitis with lesion <5 mm, periodontally involved teeth <8 mm probing depth, mobility I and II and without severe inflammation, exfoliating primary teeth without severe mobility (not expected to exfoliate in a few weeks) are observed and monitored during anti-neoplastic chemotherapy and HSCTs, may be appropriate when there is insufficient time for complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols [23,24,25,26]. (Level of evidence: III, Grade of Recommendation: B.)\n-\n2.\nSuggest periodontal therapy prior to and maintenance after cancer therapy (both head and neck radiation and anti-neoplastic chemotherapy) for general good oral health. (Level of evidence: III, Grade of Recommendation: B) No guideline is possible with respect to its benefit in relation to oral complications encountered during head and neck radiation and/ or anti-neoplastic chemotherapy.\nApproaches in managing dental disease in cancer survivors\n-\n(i)\nFluoride therapy compliance\nTwo cohort studies were retrieved in the current literature search examining the compliance of patients to fluoride therapy post radiotherapy. They found that the compliance rate decreased significantly with time; Dhalom et al. [28] found a 54% compliance at 15 months for 5% sodium fluoride varnish and Thariat et al. [29] found only a 12% compliance for fluoride gel (concentration not stated) delivered in a custom tray at 24 months.\n-\n(ii)\nChlorhexidine\nTwo new studies were included in this review [30, 31]. A randomized controlled trial compared the effects of once daily regimens (started 3\u20134 weeks prior to head and neck radiation) of 0.12% chlorhexidine, 0.5% sodium fluoride, 2% sodium iodine and no intervention; and found significant reduction in plaque index (p = 0.0026) at 6 months in all the intervention groups (i.e. chlorhexidine, sodium fluoride and sodium iodine) [30]. The chlorhexidine group resulted in the greatest significant decrease in salivary Streptococcus mutans (SM) count compared to sodium fluoride (p = 0.03) and sodium iodine (p = 0.001) [30]. The other study found that the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse twice daily started 1 week prior to and for 1 month following HSCT resulted in significant improvement of gingival index (p <0.05) from baseline [31]. However, this did not correlate with changes in periodontal pathogens.\n-\n(iii)\nDental restorations\nOnly one new study was retrieved in this review. DeMoor et al. compared the clinical performance of conventional GIC, resin modified GIC and composite resin in Class V cavities in post head and neck radiation patients [32]. The authors found that Class V restorations with composite resins had significantly less (p <0.05) failures compared to both resin reinforced and conventional GIC restorations at 24 months. In addition, composite resin restorations had significantly less failures (p <0.05) due to marginal adaptation and anatomical form compared to GIC restorations. At earlier time points (12 and 18 months), the number of failures of composite resin restorations were not significantly different from resin modified GIC. However, in patients who were non-compliant with their fluoride regime, composite resin restorations had significantly higher failures due to recurrent caries (p <0.05) compared to GIC restorations. Even so, the overall failure rate of GIC restorations (due to poorer marginal adaptation and disintegration) was still higher than composite resin restorations in non-fluoride users [32].\nThe use of fluoride was not previously considered in the 2010 systematic review. As such, extraction of this data from papers included in the 2010 publication was conducted; all studies retrieved were in post head and neck radiation patients. As with the DeMoor et al. study [32], McComb et al. [33] also found that GIC restorations had significantly less failures due to recurrent caries than composite resin restorations in non-fluoride users. In a study by Wood et al. who compared conventional GIC and amalgam restorations, authors found that GICs had significantly higher failures (due to marginal adaptation, anatomical form, and caries) compared to amalgam restorations in fluoride users [34]. This study was done in 1993, and it is likely that the properties of glass ionomer cements used were different from later studies and as such may be more sensitive to fluoride ion damage.\n-\n(iv)\nToothpaste\nThere were no new studies involving toothpaste use in cancer patients since the 2010 systematic review.\nSummary and recommendations\n-\n1.\nRecommend the use of fluoride products to prevent dental caries in post head and neck radiation patients. This remains unchanged from the 2010 systematic review. It is important to reinforce its use as compliance decreases with time. The type of fluoride delivery system did not significantly influenced caries activity. (Level of Evidence: II, Grade of Recommendation: B)\n-\n2.\nRecommend the use of chlorhexidine mouth rinse in concentrations ranging from 0.12% - 0.2% once or twice daily for the reduction of plaque accumulation and SM counts in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. This remains unchanged from the 2010 systematic review [3]. The amounts of Lactobacillus (LB) or periodontal pathogens were not affected by the use of chlorhexidine. The potential side effects of increased staining, calculus build up and temporary taste changes should be taken into account with use of chlorhexidine. (Level of Evidence: II, Grade of Recommendation: B)\n-\n3.\nRecommend the use of composite resins, resin modified GIC and amalgam restorations over conventional GIC in post head and neck radiation patients who are compliant fluoride users. In non-fluoride users, GIC restorations may be considered to reduce the rate of recurrent caries but would require frequent replacements due to breakdown in structure integrity. (Level of Evidence: II, Grade of Recommendation: B)\nChanges in dental related oral microorganisms during cancer therapy\nFourteen studies examined the temporal effect of cancer therapy on dental related oral microorganisms (Table 3). Two studies were not included in the table [47, 48]. One study [48], unlike the other studies where raw SM and LB values was used, this particular study arbitrarily categorized the amount of SM and LB into low to high levels and thus was excluded. Another study compared the oral microbiota of caries free patients versus those with radiation caries at 1 year post head and neck radiation [47]. However, there was no baseline measure, changes due to radiation was unclear [47]. All studies examined SM and LB changes; of which two studies also evaluated periodontal pathogens [35, 38].\nHead and neck radiation resulted in increases in both SM and LB oral colonization, although this was not always to statistically significant levels [35, 36, 39,40,41]. Other than chlorhexidine, hyperbaric oxygen therapy was also evaluated by one study which resulted in reduction of SM and LB[10]. Studies on periodontal flora reported shifts in periodontal pathogens in patients who were post head and neck radiation; however no clear pattern could be observed [35, 38]. More studies are needed to examine the effect of cancer therapy on periodontal related microorganisms and the clinical relevance of this change.\nUnlike in head and neck radiation patients, anti-neoplastic chemotherapy did not appear to increase SM or LB oral colonization. In fact, these organisms remain either unchanged or reduced in amounts during anti-neoplastic chemotherapy [42,43,44,45,46, 49]. The reduction of SM and LB during anti-neoplastic chemotherapy was most pronounced during the induction and treatment phase. This is likely due to the anti-microbial effect of certain cytotoxic agents used in these regimens (e.g., doxorubicin).\nSummary\n-\n1.\nThe colonization of SM and LB increased in post head and neck radiation patients. (Level of Evidence: III)\n-\n2.\nThe colonization of SM and LB remain unchanged or decreased during anti-neoplastic chemotherapy. (Level of Evidence: III)\nDiscussion\nAs expected, there were no randomized clinical trials on pre-cancer therapy dental evaluation/treatment protocols as there are obvious ethical concerns with providing no treatment in cancer patients in a prospective study. However, since the 2010 systematic review, a well-executed non-randomized clinical trial [24] and several studies examining different protocols ranging from minimal to complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to cancer therapy have been published [18, 19, 27]. An appraisal of all the studies retrieved in this current and the previous review suggest that patients who underwent partial dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to chemotherapy and HSCTs involving removal of moderate and severe dental pathologies experienced no or minimal odontogenic related complications during cancer therapy [24, 25, 26]. Even in minimal pre-cancer dental evaluation/treatment protocols, whereby only acute and symptomatic dental pathology were addressed prior to chemotherapy and HSCTs, only 3\u20134% of patients developed dental related complications [16, 18]. In a retrospective review of the Nationwide Inpatient sample, Allareddy et al. found that leukemia adults who had gingivitis/ periodontitis were at higher risk for septicemia, bacterial infections and mycoses [50]. However, the conclusions made in this paper must be interpreted with great caution as it was unclear how (i.e., who, when) the inpatient diagnosis of periodontal disease was made; and thus the prevalence of periodontal disease may be grossly inaccurate. The overall weighted prevalence of dental infections during cancer therapy in this review (5.4%) was low and comparable to that reported in the 2010 systematic review (5.8%). However, we noted that the pre-existing oral conditions and the type of pre-cancer dental evaluation/treatment protocols of patients in these studies were unclear which could potentially bias the results. Nonetheless, the option for partial dental evaluation/treatment protocols should be considered in patients where there is an urgency to start cancer therapy as soon as possible; leaving little time for complete dental evaluation/treatment. Complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols though ideal must be reconsidered if the time taken to eliminate all active and potential sources of infections in a patient completely and for healing to occur would result in a delay in cancer therapy initiation and negatively impact prognosis. Another concern is the risk for complications arising from pre-cancer therapy dental treatment, which in this group of medical vulnerable patients is significant. Such complications may cause delay in cancer therapy initiation and, in severe cases, result in a systemic infection [20, 22, 23]. Although beyond the scope of this review, in view of the low incidence of dental adverse events, it may be of interest to evaluate the cost and benefits for such pre-cancer dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to commencement of cancer therapy. The cost of such protocols should be weighed against the cost and burden of managing adverse oral events during cancer therapy that may be prevented with dental evaluation and treatment prior to cancer therapy.\nIn post head and neck radiation patients, oral colonization with SM and LB was significantly higher than at baseline [35, 36, 39,40,41]. Chlorhexidine and to a lesser extent sodium fluoride reduced SM and perhaps caries risk in these patients [30]. The recommendations that both chlorhexidine and fluoride products are effective in reducing caries activity in post head and neck radiation patients from the 2010 systematic review are thus still valid. However, compliance with fluoride use was found to decrease drastically over time; with one study reporting an extremely low compliance of 12% for fluoride gel delivered in a custom tray at 24 months [29]. It is therefore imperative that clinicians managing post head and neck radiation cancer survivors emphasize the continued use of fluoride products for caries prevention. Since, there are no differences in the type of fluoride products, a strategy may be to recommend trying the various products available and using the one most acceptable to the patient.\nThere is evidence for the cariostatic properties of GIC in the literature and its benefits in patients with high caries risk. However, in this systematic review, GIC restorations had significantly higher failure rates than composite resin restorations in post head and neck radiation patients [32, 33]. Most of the failures were due to structural degradation. We hypothesize that since GIC maintains its structural strength when hydrated; in a post- head and neck radiation patient suffering from salivary gland hypofunction, the structural integrity of GIC may be compromised which may explain their high number of failures. That withstanding, in non-fluoride users, the overall GIC restorations resulted in less failures due to secondary caries compared to composite resin restorations [32, 33]. This suggests that in patients who are non-compliant fluoride users, GIC restorations may be considered with the caveat that these restorations will require regular maintenance and replacements due to breakdown in structural integrity.\nConclusions\n-\n1.\nThe weighted prevalence of dental infections during cancer therapy is relatively low (5.4%) and is comparable to that reported in the 2010 systematic review (5.8%).\n-\n2.\nPost extraction complications ranged from 3 to 40% in cancer patients and were most common after third molar extractions.\n-\n3.\nIn view of the relatively low dental infections during cancer therapy and the complications after third molar extractions, partial dental evaluation/treatment protocols prior to anti-neplastic therapy and HSCT whereby minor caries (within dentin), asymptomatic third molars or asymptomatic teeth without excessive probing depth (<8 mm), mobility (I and II) or with periapical lesions of <5 mm were obseved; appear to be a viable option; if there is insufficient time for complete dental evaluation/treatment protocols.\n-\n4.\nThe guideline for use of fluoride products remains unchanged from the 2010 systematic review and they are recommended to prevent dental caries in post head and neck radiation patients. It is important to reinforce its use as compliance decreases with time.\n-\n5.\nThe use of chlorhexidine mouth rinse (in concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 0.2% once or twice daily) remains unchanged from the 2010 systematic review and is recommended for the reduction of plaque accumulation and SM counts in post head and neck radiation patients.\n-\n6.\nThe use of composite resins, resin modified GIC and amalgam restorations is recommended over conventional GIC in post head and neck radiation patients who are fluoride users. In non-fluoride users, GIC restorations are suggested to reduce the rate of recurrent caries but may require frequent replacements due to breakdown in structure integrity.\n-\n7.\nThere was an increase in cariogenic microbes (SM and LB) in post head and neck radiation patients which was not observed in patients receiving anti-neoplastic chemotherapy.\nReferences\nCollins FS, Varmus H (2015) A new initiative on precision medicine.

      "text": "Prosthetic Teeth: A Patient\u2019s Guide to Dentures and Implants\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Maxillary (upper) dentures have consistently higher long-term survival rates than mandibular (lower) dentures.\n- Implant-retained dentures generally lead to better patient satisfaction and stability compared to conventional dentures.\n- Wearing dentures, whether partial or complete, can significantly impair chewing efficiency compared to natural teeth.\n- There is a recognized need for innovation in the materials and design of removable partial dentures.\n- Research suggests a surprising link between denture wearing and lower mortality in patients with good cardiovascular health.\nThe Great Divide: Upper vs. Lower Dentures\nThe lower denture. For dentists and patients, it\u2019s often the main event. The source of the frustration. We spend years in school learning ideal techniques, but reality is a different beast. The upper denture is usually predictable. It has the whole palate to work with, creating a natural suction that holds it in place. A stable seal.\nThe lower jaw is another story. It\u2019s a slick, muscular basin. There\u2019s no broad palate for suction. There\u2019s a tongue. A powerful, restless muscle that is constantly lifting and unseating the very thing you need to stay put. So when research consistently shows that maxillary dentures have higher survival rates than mandibular ones, no one in the field is surprised [2] [7]. It\u2019s not about the quality of the denture. It\u2019s about the landscape. One is a stable shelf, the other is a moving floor.\nThis fundamental problem drives so much of modern prosthodontics. How do you anchor a prosthesis in an inherently unstable environment? For decades, the answer was messy adhesives and wishful thinking. The clinical goal has always been to achieve what we call occlusal stability\u2014making sure the bite is perfect so the denture doesn\u2019t shift under pressure [1]. But that\u2019s easier said than done when the foundation itself is a moving target.\nImplants: The Modern Fix with Its Own Problems\nEnter implants. The game-changer. By placing a few titanium posts into the jawbone, we can give a lower denture something to clip onto. Snaps. Suddenly, the floating piece of acrylic is anchored. This has, without question, transformed patient outcomes. The data is clear: implant-retained overdentures have higher survival rates, fewer issues, and make patients much, much happier than their old conventional plates [5]. Research also shows implant-supported partial dentures improve quality of life more than the traditional options [8].\nCase closed, right? Not quite.\nImplants aren\u2019t a universal panacea. They are a surgical solution. They require sufficient bone, a patient healthy enough for surgery, and a significant financial investment. And they come with their own unique set of headaches. While they solve the problem of the denture floating, they create new forces. The hardware can fail. Screws can loosen. The clips can wear out. The studies that praise implants also quietly mention these \u201cbiomechanical complications\u201d [8]. They are manageable things, but they aren\u2019t nothing. It\u2019s a trade-off. We\u2019ve swapped one set of problems for another, arguably better, set of problems.\nAnd for patients with some teeth remaining, the conversation gets even more complex. The world of removable partial dentures\u2014the classic metal-and-plastic appliance that fills the gaps\u2014is lagging. We\u2019re still using designs that have been around for decades. There\u2019s a recognized, urgent need for innovation in the materials and fabrication of these partials to make them more comfortable, more aesthetic, and less damaging to the remaining teeth [3] [10].\nFunction Over Form: The Daily Reality of Prosthetics\nHere\u2019s the part of the conversation that sometimes gets lost in the talk of stability and materials. What is it actually like to live with these things? We can make a beautiful set of teeth, perfectly balanced and stable on the dental chair. But what happens when the patient tries to eat an apple?\nThe hard truth is that prosthetic teeth are not natural teeth. One cross-sectional study laid it out plainly: both complete and partial denture wearers have worse chewing ability and a lower oral health-related quality of life than people with their natural dentition [6]. It\u2019s a huge improvement over having no teeth, but it is a compromise. Restoring aesthetics is achievable. Restoring full, natural function is the holy grail we are still chasing.\nThis is especially critical for older adults. For them, immediate or transitional dentures are vital tools, allowing function during the long healing process after extractions or before a final prosthesis is made [4]. It\u2019s about maintaining quality of life, not just waiting for the ideal endpoint.\nThe story of prosthetics is one of incremental, hard-won gains. It\u2019s about managing compromises. But there are occasional, strange glimmers of something more. A recent 27-year prospective study found an odd association: among people with ideal cardiovascular health, wearing dentures was linked with lower mortality [9]. This doesn\u2019t mean dentures save lives. That\u2019s a ridiculous conclusion. The likely story is more subtle. Perhaps the act of restoring oral function is tied to a whole suite of other positive health behaviors. We don\u2019t know. But it suggests that what we do in the mouth doesn\u2019t stay in the mouth. It\u2019s a thread worth pulling. For now, we remain focused on the immediate challenge. The floating lower plate. The partial that doesn\u2019t feel right. The bite that isn\u2019t quite there. The work continues.\nReferences\n[1] Basunbul, A., Goktug, G., & Morgano, S. M. (2021).

      "text": "How Your Diet Shapes Your Smile: What Every Patient Should Know\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Poor nutrition is linked to cavities, gum disease, and even oral cancer\n- High-sugar diets promote enamel erosion and bacterial imbalance\n- Fruits and vegetables help reduce the risk of tooth decay\n- Athletes face unique oral health risks due to sports drinks and diet patterns\n- A balanced diet supports both oral and systemic health\nTable of Contents\nSome patients drive dentists crazy. They\u2019re the ones who do everything right. Brushing. Flossing. Regular check-ups. You look at their chart, and it\u2019s perfect. Then you look in their mouth. And it\u2019s a mess. Puffy gums that bleed at the slightest touch. New decay hiding between the teeth. What gives?\nWe\u2019ve been stuck in the same conversation for decades. Brush better. Floss more. Avoid candy. We\u2019ve treated the mouth like a simple machine you just have to keep clean. But it isn\u2019t working. We\u2019re bailing out a boat with a teaspoon while there\u2019s a huge hole in the bottom.\nThe hole isn\u2019t in the tooth. It\u2019s in the diet. The science is getting ridiculously clear on this point. What you eat isn\u2019t just part of the story. It\u2019s the whole plot. We\u2019ve been obsessed with the aftermath\u2014the plaque and the cavities\u2014and almost completely ignored the fuel source [1].\nThe Real War Isn\u2019t About Plaque\nLook, a cavity is just the end result. A hole. The real war is happening on a totally different level, a microscopic one. Your mouth is a jungle. Billions of tiny bugs; a microbiome. And most of the time, they live in a fragile balance.\nBut a bad diet? That\u2019s like dumping toxic waste into the jungle [3]. All those processed carbs and sugars. The bad bugs love it. They multiply like crazy and start running the place. The good guys that protect you? They get crowded out. Scientists call it dysbiosis [6]. Some would call it a hostile takeover.\nAnd this isn\u2019t about a simple cavity anymore. We\u2019re talking about periodontitis. That\u2019s not just \u201cgum disease.\u201d It\u2019s bone loss. The actual bone that holds your teeth in place. It\u2019s crumbling. Why? Because that out-of-control microbiome is spewing inflammatory toxins 24/7 [8]. Your body is trying to fight back, and the battlefield is your own gums and bone. Poor nutrition just makes it worse, weakening your defenses and leaving you wide open for attack [1].\nThat\u2019s the real danger here. Not the filling you might need, but the foundation you\u2019re about to lose. The garden metaphor is the only one that works. You can pull weeds (plaque) all day long. But if the soil itself (your diet) is garbage? The weeds just come back with a vengeance.\nThis Isn\u2019t a Niche Problem\nAnd don\u2019t think this is just about people who mainline soda. Some of the worst cases seen were even athletes [2]. People trying to be incredibly healthy. But what are they actually doing? Chugging sugary sports drinks. Constant hits of simple carbs for fuel. Breathing through their mouth. A 2024 review basically called them a walking dental disaster waiting to happen [10]. They\u2019re creating a perfect acid-bath for their teeth while trying to win a race.\nThen there\u2019s the rest of us. Life is stressful. A study on COVID habits showed what we all knew instinctively\u2014our diets went completely off the rails [5]. More snacking. Less healthy food. You can draw a direct line from that stress to a decline in oral health.\nIt\u2019s a vicious cycle for older adults, too. Teeth get worn down, maybe some are missing. It gets harder to chew things like raw vegetables or a steak. So what do you reach for? Softer, processed stuff. That diet then makes your oral health even worse, which makes it even harder to eat well [7]. It\u2019s a downward spiral. It\u2019s no wonder other research shows a clear link between eating more fruits and vegetables and having fewer cavities [9]. It all connects.\nSo, Now What?\nThe bottom line? The game has changed. For dentists, just drilling and filling feels like malpractice now. It\u2019s patching cracks in a dam that\u2019s about to burst from the pressure behind it. We have to talk about food. It\u2019s our job now.\nFor you, it means you have to see food differently. Every single thing you eat and drink either helps the good guys in your mouth or feeds the enemy. It\u2019s that simple. Are you on team health or team disease? That \u201chealthy\u201d granola bar packed with hidden sugar? That smoothie? You have to start asking what it\u2019s really doing to the jungle in your mouth.\nThis isn\u2019t a fad. It\u2019s a massive shift in understanding how our bodies work. The mouth is an ecosystem, not a machine. And your most powerful tool for controlling it isn\u2019t in your bathroom cabinet. It\u2019s in your kitchen.\nReferences\n[1] Str\u0105czek, A., Sza\u0142kowska, J., Sutkowska, P., Srebrna, A., Puzio, N., Piasecka, A., Piskorz, N., B\u0142aszczyk, J., & Thum-Tyzo, K. (2023).

      "text": "Tooth Avulsion: How Fast Action and Smart Management Save Smiles\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Tooth avulsion is a dental emergency where a tooth is completely displaced from its socket.\n- Replantation within 15\u201360 minutes significantly improves chances of saving the tooth.\n- Storing the tooth in milk or Hank\u2019s solution preserves vital cells better than saliva or water.\n- Long-term care can include root canal therapy, splinting, and follow-up visits\u2014averaging $1,600 over 2 years.\n- Both public education and professional training are critical for improving avulsion outcomes.\nIt\u2019s Not a Broken Bone, It\u2019s a Fire\nYou know, sometimes I think the people writing the textbooks live on a different planet. They write these beautiful, logical guides for handling a knocked-out tooth [2] [6]. Perfect little decision trees.\nNEWSLETTER\nGet expert guidance and new breakthroughs in dentistry delivered straight to your inbox.\nAnd then there\u2019s reality.\nThe phone rings, it\u2019s a parent screaming, and a seven-year-old\u2019s front tooth is lying in the dirt.\nHere\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get. An avulsed tooth isn\u2019t like a broken arm. You can\u2019t just set it and wait. It\u2019s a fire. The moment that tooth is out of the socket, the house is burning. The \u201chouse\u201d is the collection of living cells stuck to the root\u2014the periodontal ligament. Those cells are what let the tooth live and breathe in the jaw. And when they\u2019re exposed to air, they start dying. Fast.\nWe have maybe an hour. Tops [2]. After that, the house is pretty much a pile of ash.\nSo when a parent tells a denist they wrapped the tooth carefully in a tissue to keep it \u201cclean\u201d they often wince. That\u2019s not cleaning it; it\u2019s fanning the flames. A dry paper towel sucks the life right out of those cells. A 2021 study basically proved what we see all the time: dry time is the enemy [7]. It leads to ankylosis.\nAnkylosis is when the tooth fuses to the bone. It\u2019s the dental equivalent of paving over what used to be your front lawn. The tooth is stuck. It won\u2019t move. In a kid, it\u2019ll look shorter and shorter as the rest of their face grows around it. It\u2019s a dead end.\nOur Perfect Rules for a Messy World\nThe solution is so, so simple. It\u2019s a fire extinguisher that everyone has.\nMilk.\nThat\u2019s it. If you can\u2019t stick the tooth right back in the socket, drop it in a cup of milk. It keeps the cells alive. It buys us time. It\u2019s the single most important thing a person can do in that moment of panic.\nAnd nobody knows this.\nParents don\u2019t know it [5]. Coaches don\u2019t know it. Here\u2019s the kicker\u2014a study from just this year showed that a bunch of new dental school grads were fuzzy on the details [3]. Freshly minted dentists! If they\u2019re not sure, how can we expect a panicked mom on a playground to be?\nIt drives dentists crazy. We spend all this time in our own world, debating the finer points of splinting techniques or whether one antibiotic is better than another [1] [8] [9]. We\u2019ve got all these high-tech fire trucks ready to go. But we\u2019re failing to teach people the one thing that matters: don\u2019t let the house burn down in the first place.\nHandling the tooth by the root? That\u2019s like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. Just don\u2019t do it.\nThe Real Cost of a Knocked-Out Tooth\nLet\u2019s say they get it right. Tooth goes in milk. They get to the office fast. We get it splinted in. Great.\nNow the real work starts. Babysitting this tooth for the rest of its life.\nThis tooth is now a high-maintenance problem child. We have to watch it constantly for infection, for resorption\u2014that\u2019s when the body just starts eating the root for lunch. It takes a ton of work to keep one of these teeth going for the long haul [4].\nAnd the cost... oh, the cost. A study from 2023 put a number on it: an average of almost ten visits and over $1,600 in just the first two years for a kid [10]. And that\u2019s the best-case scenario. That doesn\u2019t count the root canal it will almost definitely need. It doesn\u2019t count the crown. And it certainly doesn\u2019t count the thousands for an implant when the tooth finally fails 15 years later.\nSo forget the fancy guidelines for a second. The real job isn\u2019t in the dental chair. It\u2019s getting the message out there.\nIf you see it happen, just remember this:\n- Grab the tooth (the white part!).\n- Stick it back in the hole.\n- If you can\u2019t, put it in milk.\n- Get to a dentist. Now.\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s how you save the tooth. Everything else is just damage control.\n[1] Kostka, E., Meissner, S., Finke, C. H., Mandirola, M., & Preissner, S. (2014).

It argues that the 6\u2011month rule is largely a tradition rather than evidence\u2011based, and suggests a personalized recall interval driven by individual risk factors\u2014low\u2011risk patients could safely extend intervals, while high\u2011risk or special\u2011population patients may still need more frequent visits. The piece calls for a shift from a blanket schedule to a risk\u2011based approach to improve efficiency and patient outcomes.",
