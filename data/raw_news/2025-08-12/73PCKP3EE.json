      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of Crystal Palace vs Liverpool in the Community Shield\nThe Premier League season begins next weekend. The 20 clubs have had nearly two months of summer transfer window to get their squads in order, but there are still gaps in teams and squads that need filling.\nAnd while spending on new players by Premier League sides has already surpassed \u00a31.8billion ($2.6bn), some are still without crucial targets.\nSo with September 1 being the deadline to settle any of these issues, until January anyway, The Athletic looks at which areas the clubs need to address over the coming 26 days, and analyses how they might do so.\nManchester United still need a striker (but maybe they have an answer)\u2026\nUnited have already splashed out on their front line by bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in deals worth up to a total of \u00a3132.5million. However, they still need a striker \u2014 something that has been the case all summer. The possible exit of Rasmus Hojlund, whose form up front was questionable last season, has only increased the need.\nAdvertisement\nHojlund endured a difficult campaign, scoring only 10 goals (just four of which were in the Premier League) in 52 appearances in all competitions. The Denmark international wants to stay at Old Trafford, but as reported in our most recent Transfer DealSheet, offers of \u00a330million will be considered.\nThe club are now closing in on the signing of Benjamin Sesko, who they have been battling with Newcastle over. Sesko wants to go to Old Trafford, and after their proposal worth \u20ac75million, plus \u20ac10m in add-ons, to RB Leipzig, they are edging towards his signing.\nAnalysis: How well does Sesko fit Amorim\u2019s system?\nUnited are all-in on head coach Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3-4-3, so what is needed from a striker in that system?\nIn short: strength to receive and hold up the ball, ability to link up with the two No 10s, lots of shooting, and being a nuisance for defences with runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres, now of Arsenal, became the blueprint for an \u2018Amorim striker\u2019 over recent seasons at Sporting CP.\nSesko has attributes that show promise for that profile. The best fit is physicality: he is 6ft 5in (195cm), unsurprisingly talented in the air, and will certainly make defenders nervous. In comparison to Hojlund, Sesko shot more frequently, accurately, and from further out over the past season. He often shoots quickly, and he shoots hard.\nThe concerns are over the 22-year-old\u2019s decision-making and consistency. The single-minded desire to score that is so attractive at first in a striker can also be a drawback, and Sesko has been guilty of shooting rather than picking a good pass at times for Leipzig. His hold-up and link-up play also need some work.\n\u2026 and should really sign a midfielder, too\nUnited are assessing their options in midfield, as covered in The Transfer DealSheet. Mark Critchley reported that Amorim is keen to add more dynamism there, while yesterday David Ornstein revealed that they had made contact with Brighton & Hove Albion, via intermediaries, to explore the conditions of a deal for Carlos Baleba.\nAdvertisement\nBringing in Cunha and Mbeumo indicates Bruno Fernandes will be pushed further back in the midfield this season, though there is flexibility for him to still step into a No 10 role at times.\nTo make the most of Fernandes\u2019 creativity, Amorim\u2019s system needs an athletic, busy, physical, holding midfielder who can stop United looking so open in defence and help create threats quickly when they do recover possession. Casemiro\u2019s one-on-one defending is still strong, but at 33 years old he no longer has the legs to provide the level of defensive cover Amorim demands for 90 minutes. Manuel Ugarte has the tenacity but progressing the ball is a weakness for him.\nAmorim will want a midfielder who can intervene early in opposition moves, has the passing vision to exploit transitional moments, is comfortable in build-up and has the stamina to help control the midfield for a whole game.\nAnalysis: Who fits that bill?\nAfter splashing out on the forward line, also bringing in a top-tier, Premier League-proven midfielder is going to be difficult.\nOur Carl Anka\u2019s \u2018Shopping for Amorim\u2019 series took a look at the midfield market (including Baleba) to see who could fulfil the United head coach\u2019s requirements \u2014 you can read that piece below.\nNewcastle also still need a striker\nEddie Howe\u2019s side have struggled to secure their centre-forward targets this summer. Hugo Ekitike joined Liverpool after Newcastle\u2019s \u00a375million offer was turned down by Eintracht Frankfurt, and as mentioned above, Sesko \u2014 who they had bid twice for \u2014 wants to join Manchester United instead.\nAll this comes with the added pressure of Alexander Isak looking to leave the club. Newcastle rejected an offer of \u00a3110million from Liverpool and value him at around \u00a3150m, so he could still stay. The club\u2019s preference was always for a new striker signing this summer to be in addition to and not instead of Isak, and Callum Wilson has left St James\u2019 Park at the end of his contract, so they would like to sign a centre-forward even if the Swede remains their player.\nAdvertisement\nAnalysis: Who could Newcastle sign?\nWe can surmise that Newcastle want a powerful striker who is strong on the transition and a solid finisher. Their latest bid of at least \u20ac80million for Sesko suggests they are willing to spend.\nBrentford\u2019s Yoane Wissa is a known target, and Newcastle\u2019s \u00a325million bid for him was rebuffed with the west London club valuing the 28-year-old at a minimum of \u00a350m. Personal terms would not be a problem, and if Newcastle can reach a club-to-club agreement, Wissa could fit well: he gets himself into excellent shooting positions, and had the best expected goals per shot number in last season\u2019s Premier League.\nHis off-ball runs are less direct than some other options, but important in creating space for others to exploit. Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimaraes could benefit.\nNicolas Jackson is another option with Premier League experience, and Chelsea are open to selling if they receive the right proposal, as reported in The Transfer DealSheet. His finishing is not as clinical as Isak\u2019s, but his abilities on the transition are particularly attractive for Newcastle, who often look to target runs in behind \u2014 per SkillCorner, no player made more sprints (at least 25km/h) that ended behind the defensive line last season than Jackson.\nLooking outside the Premier League, 25-year-old Moise Kean was one of Europe\u2019s most successful forwards on the transition last season. He scored 19 goals in 32 Serie A games for Fiorentina, and his key weapons are fast runs in behind and a poacher\u2019s eye for goal once he is in the penalty area.\nAlternatively, Porto\u2019s Samu Aghehowa is rapid, a good target on the transition, and gets himself into great positions. The now 21-year-old scored 19 goals in 30 league games after joining them from Atletico Madrid last summer.\nBrentford need to replace Mbeumo\u2026 and maybe Wissa too\nAfter losing their Premier League top scorer Mbeumo to Manchester United, captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal, and head coach Thomas Frank to Tottenham Hotspur, Brentford will look very different this season.\nThey have signed former Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson from Ajax to replace Norgaard, but have not brought in any attackers yet to fill the hole left by Mbeumo\u2019s departure. This is a particular concern given that, as mentioned above, Wissa could also leave in the coming weeks.\nAdvertisement\nAnalysis: Who could replace Mbeumo?\nThe Cameroon international\u2019s key attributes are as much about his creative presence as his goalscoring.\nHe was a significant penalty-box threat last season, but as this pizza chart below shows, some of his most important work was in progressing the ball up the pitch.\nBrentford are unlikely to find a Premier League-proven winger within their financial reach who can carry this much of a creative burden.\nThey could turn to developing talents in continental Europe (which, of course, is where they found Mbeumo and Wissa in the first place) and take a chance on someone such as Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Ansgar Knauff. The 23-year-old recorded 10 goal contributions in 30 Bundesliga appearances last term, and like Mbeumo, he makes up for a lower shot frequency with his progressive passing and movement.\nHis goals in the Bundesliga last term also showed off his pace, powerful finishing and ability in duelling with defenders. Frankfurt have a recent history of selling attackers to the Premier League (Ekitike to Liverpool, Omar Marmoush to Manchester City).\nBrentford have proven to be a springboard for players to join top Premier League sides, and Knauff would have a strong chance of being their starting right-winger. So, while Frankfurt can offer him Champions League football this season, a move to the Londoners could be attractive in the long term, career-wise.\nBournemouth and Liverpool need a centre-back\nThe departures of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool for a combined \u00a390million have left Bournemouth conspicuously lighter at the back.\nAdrien Truffert, 23, has arrived from Rennes to succeed Kerkez at left-back, but there is no replacement yet for Huijsen. His centre-back partner of last season, Illia Zabarnyi, is also being pursued by Paris Saint-Germain, leaving an obvious gap in the squad for another player in the heart of their defence.\nAdvertisement\nLiverpool, meanwhile, sold Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for \u00a330million and need additional cover for Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez\u2019s injury on their pre-season tour is not expected to keep him out for long, but the club\u2019s longest-serving player has battled with fitness concerns across his career.\nThere\u2019s a reason why we have grouped Liverpool and Bournemouth \u2014 clubs who, on paper, do not tend to operate in the same market \u2014 in one section. Though Liverpool will be in the Champions League this season and Bournemouth will be competing at the upper end of the Premier League\u2019s mid-table, both are likely to be after a young defender with room to develop, and one who can defend high and on the front foot.\nFor Bournemouth, he would be a starter, while Liverpool would likely want someone who could develop while being used as cover.\nMarc Guehi was named in The Transfer DealSheet as one player the champions are interested in \u2014 but if the Crystal Palace captain proves difficult to acquire again this summer, what other, more achievable options are out there?\nWhich centre-back prospects might Bournemouth and Liverpool go for?\nRennes defender Jeremy Jacquet, 20, is of long-term interest to Arsenal, as reported in The Transfer DealSheet, and it is not difficult to see why. He is defensively proactive, aerially strong, a capable tackler, and handy going forward.\nAfter returning from a loan at Ligue 2 side Clermont in January, Jacquet started 11 Ligue 1 games, and signed a new deal in May. This complicates any move as the French side are clearly keen to retain him, but a starting Premier League spot at Bournemouth or a chance to learn from Van Dijk and Konate at Anfield could be tempting.\nCarlos Dominguez of Celta Vigo is another option.\nHe is well-rounded defensively, comfortable on the ball, and happy to help progress up the pitch. The 24-year-old came up through Celta\u2019s youth system but was named on the bench for 18 La Liga games last season, so a move for him could be easier.\nStaying in Spain, Villarreal\u2019s Pau Navarro is a less experienced choice.\nIn 2024-25, his first La Liga season, he started eight games and was used as a substitute in another nine. Stepping up to a Premier League starting spot immediately might be too much to ask, but the 20-year-old shows promise as a ball-playing centre-back and could be a promising project.\nLeeds need a striker to keep them up\nPromoted Leeds United have brought in seven new recruits, and manager Daniel Farke has declared their central defence and central midfield \u201cmore or less sorted\u201d. They now join the queue of clubs looking for a striker to spark a successful season.\nMateo Joseph has made it clear that he wishes to leave and refused to join Leeds\u2019 pre-season camp in Germany. Joel Piroe, their top scorer in the Championship last term, and new signing Lukas Nmecha both lack Premier League experience.\nAdvertisement\nTheir top target is 24-year-old Rodrigo Muniz, who scored eight goals for Fulham in the top flight last season while making only eight starts. As reported by The Athletic on July 24, Leeds still hope a deal can be done, but Fulham insist publicly that Muniz is not for sale.\nAnalysis: If not Muniz, then who?\nIf we look at the attacking attributes of top-target Muniz, Leeds are after someone who is strong in the air, capable with his back to goal and gets shots off quickly. The Brazilian is also a strong creator, but what Farke needs most urgently is efficiency in front of goal.\nDominic Calvert-Lewin is available as a free agent after his Everton contract expired at the start of July. He would bring Premier League experience, aerial ability, some ball-carrying ability and physicality, and is also a Yorkshireman, but his shooting is not as efficient as Muniz and at 28, he would be a short-term solution. There would also be doubts over Calvert-Lewin\u2019s ability to stay fit.\nOsasuna\u2019s Ante Budimir is an option as a penalty-box poacher. He was prolific in La Liga last term, scoring 21 times in 38 matches, and is another option who is strong in the air and shoots frequently. Aged 34, he would be even less of a long-term answer, and Leeds would need a backup \u2014 but unlike Calvert-Lewin, he has been consistently available, starting 34 of last season\u2019s 38 league matches. The Croatian\u2019s threat and consistency in the box could help them stay up.\nIf Leeds want to take a risk on a less proven player but one with more left in the tank, Roberto Piccoli fits the profile. He is only 24 but has amassed 134 Serie A appearances and 23 goals across several clubs. Last season was his most prolific: he scored 10 times for Cagliari \u2014 a quarter of their league total \u2014 in 37 starts. It\u2019s not a blistering rate, but he offers more longevity than some of their other striker options.\nEverton\u2019s right side needs serious work\nSince The Athletic reviewed the gaps in Everton\u2019s squad in early July, there has not been enough movement \u2014 by manager David Moyes\u2019 own admission. Thierno Barry (a striker) and Mark Travers (a goalkeeper) should provide good competition for Beto and Jordan Pickford respectively at opposite ends of the pitch, while promising young left-back Adam Aznou has arrived from Bayern Munich and Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s loan from Flamengo was made permanent. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has also joined from Chelsea for an initial \u00a325million.\nThe biggest concern is their right side. In an ideal world, they would sign two right-wingers in time for the new season; as it is, Moyes has no recognised right-winger to call on, with Dwight McNeil and Iliman Ndiaye filling in there.\nBehind that empty space on the depth chart is another thin patch in the squad. Ashley Young\u2019s departure at the end of his contract removes a valuable option at right-back, even though he turned 40 last month, the 36-year-old Seamus Coleman\u2019s longevity must surely soon run out and neither Nathan Patterson nor Jake O\u2019Brien is fully convincing as a starting full-back.\nAdvertisement\nIn terms of the profiles of new signings, Moyes told The Athletic that bringing in younger prospects or players from lower leagues is \u201cnot a problem\u201d for Everton. At right-back, this could be enough; a new arrival would have Coleman to learn from, and Patterson and O\u2019Brien to offer cover.\nHowever, any right-winger needs to be able to hit the ground running in the Premier League, and Moyes said it is \u201charder to attract\u201d players at the top end, or those with European experience.\nEverton have been looking at Southampton winger Tyler Dibling, but there is a gap in the clubs\u2019 valuations. Everton\u2019s latest bid for the 19-year-old was worth around \u00a340million, which the Championship club countered with a proposal of \u00a345m, plus \u00a35m more in easily achievable bonuses and a 25 per cent sell-on clause. That is more than Everton want to pay, and Southampton have been informed of their intention to focus on other targets.\nThey are also interested in 20-year-old Lyon winger Malick Fofana, who would be a promising prospect, but his record last season suggests he is not ready to start in the Premier League: he made 29 Ligue 1 appearances, 13 of them from the bench, and scored five goals.\nThese are far from the only issues for Everton to solve: Moyes had hoped to bring in 10 new players by the end of this transfer window, and there is also a need to add depth at centre-back and in midfield. As well as signing Dewsbury-Hall, Everton have also opened talks with Manchester City over a potential season-long loan move for Jack Grealish.\nThe clubs with the opposite problem\u2026\nBrighton, Chelsea, and Manchester City are the standout clubs in terms of needing to trim their squads. For more information on how and where, The Athletic\u2019s writers have taken a look at their respective situations in the pieces below.\nCity manager Pep Guardiola has been vocal about wanting a smaller pool of players to work with, and Grealish, Kalvin Phillips, James McAtee and Stefan Ortega could be among those to go. Jordan Campbell has audited their squad.\nAdvertisement\nBrighton are overflowing at centre-back and in central midfield, with potential for some younger players to leave on loan. Andy Naylor has weighed up who should be packing their bags.\nLiam Twomey looked at where Chelsea stand. The new world champions have already sorted exits for players including Joao Felix, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Armando Broja and Lesley Ugochukwu, but still want to move on Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell and more. There is more on exactly which of their excess personnel could end up elsewhere in this week\u2019s Transfer DealSheet.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"
