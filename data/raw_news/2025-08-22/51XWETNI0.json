  "content": "Shareholders in this payments giant have seen their portfolios benefit over time.\n\nMastercard (MA -0.20%) is a behemoth in the payments industry. The company helps facilitate commerce across the globe. In the latest quarter (Q2 2025 ended June 30), it handled a whopping $2.6 trillion in volume and processed 43.5 billion transactions. These key figures demonstrate Mastercard's scale.\n\nThe business has done a good job taking care of its shareholders, even in recent times. If you invested $10,000 in this financial stock exactly three years ago, here's how much money you'd have today.\n\nIn the past three years, shares of Mastercard have generated a total return of 68% (as of Aug. 20). This means that a $10,000 investment would be worth $16,800 right now. That's a superb gain for a 36-month period of time, translating to a compound annual return of 18.9%. This gain makes the business a better performer during those three years than the overall S&P 500 index.\n\nThe stock's gain can be partly attributed to the company's underlying performance. Between the second quarter of 2022 and the most recent quarter, revenue increased by 47%. Diluted earnings per share climbed by an even better 74% during that time. Strong fundamental gains can help drive the share price higher.\n\nInvestors might be inclined to buy Mastercard stock after seeing how well it did in the past. While this is a wonderful business with an impressive track record of revenue and profit growth, the current valuation does look stretched. This unfavorable setup can limit upside going forward.\n\nFor those who want to buy the stock, you must be comfortable paying a price-to-earnings ratio of 39.5. That's an expensive valuation, so maybe it's best for investors to wait for a pullback before choosing to add Mastercard to their portfolio.",

      "text": "Valuation is the process of figuring out what something is worth. Spoiler alert: Stocks and other assets usually don't cost (the price) what they're truly worth (the value) -- they can be either overpriced or underpriced. Investors can achieve better long-term returns by consistently identifying investments that are mispriced and using this knowledge to their advantage.\nOverview\nWhat valuation is\nA company that goes public sells shares to investors, with each representing a small percentage ownership stake in the business. Valuation seeks to determine what those businesses are worth now or what those businesses could be worth at some future date. The process is both a science and an art. It's a science because it's a fundamental analysis that uses numbers and formulas. But it's also an art because investors need to use estimates and make some assumptions as well, injecting a measure of uncertainty. The more uncertainty there is to the valuation process, the harder it is to confidently assign a higher value.\nThere are two major camps when it comes to valuation: intrinsic value and relative value. On one hand, the intrinsic valuation process attempts to predict all of the future cash flows for the life of the asset to determine the present value of the asset. This can be especially helpful when investing in something with a known return (such as a bond) or when buying a business outright. On the other hand, the relative valuation process is especially helpful for stocks since they frequently change hands and usually represent businesses with unknown lifespans. This relative valuation approach applies a premium to the fundamental numbers (20 times a company's profit, for example) based on what the market will support.\nHow it works\nHow valuation works\nInvesting great Warren Buffett prefers the intrinsic valuation method because he acquires businesses outright when the price is attractive. And he once gave a great example at a meeting for shareholders of his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.07%)(BRK.B -0.07%). In the 1970's, he bought See's Candies for $25 million. But it's earned around $2 billion cumulatively in his 50 years of owning it. From this, we see that Buffett clearly bought See's Candies for far below its intrinsic value -- he got far more out of it than what he put into it. And this ultimately means that he made a small fortune from this one investment.\nMost investors aren't buying entire businesses, but many still use the principles of intrinsic value when investing in stocks. However, investors more commonly use relative valuation methods. For example, let's say that you can predict with a high degree of certainty that a shoe company will have earnings per share of $10 within the next five years. Shoe stocks commonly trade at 10 times earnings, if not more. Using a relative valuation method, investors could comfortably predict that this particular shoe stock will be worth $100 per share within the next five years. If that stock trades at, say, $25 per share today, you may have just stumbled upon an undervalued investment opportunity that could help you make your own small fortune.\nMethods\nValuation methods\nIn the above example, investors would use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value my imaginary shoe business. But there are situations when things aren't so simple, and different valuation tools are helpful. For example, companies without earnings can't be valued with a P/E ratio because earnings are literally part of the equation. But this doesn't necessarily mean that those businesses are worthless, so they instead might be valued with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Additionally, accounting practices can distort profits, which is why many investors like to value a company with the price-to-free cash flow ratio. In short, there are many popular valuation metrics, and each has merits.\nHowever, investors should remember that many metrics share a key shortcoming. Renowned value investor Bill Miller puts it this way, \"One hundred percent of the information you have about a company represents the past, and 100% of the value depends on the future.\" In other words, investors can't solely rely on the known numbers, but rather, they also need to have an opinion about what will happen with the business, the industry, and the economy.\nThis is why having an investment thesis is crucial when investing in a stock. A thesis will address things such as whether a market opportunity will get bigger or smaller, whether business growth will accelerate or decelerate, and whether profit margins will strengthen or deteriorate. By getting a handle on such things, investors can have an idea of the future financial state of the business. From there, they can use a valuation metric, or a combination of metrics, to determine the valuation of the company. This valuation assumption will help them decide whether it's mispriced in their favor today.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nA valuation example\nIn early 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) is a big investing topic and Nvidia (NVDA -0.4%) is a top player in the space. Market analysts have predicted a large market opportunity in AI long before it dominated the headlines. For his part, Nvidia's founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, delivered the first AI supercomputer in 2016. At the time, Nvidia stock was trading at a P/S ratio of about 6.\nLet's say that you were aware of the predictions for the AI space and were familiar with Nvidia's AI-focused products. Perhaps you didn't know exactly how high the company's revenue would soar, but you believed it would go up significantly over the coming decade. Well, even though a P/S ratio of 6 isn't exactly cheap, you still may have concluded that Nvidia stock was undervalued in 2016 because you had a high degree of certainty that it would be an AI leader, and revenue would consequently skyrocket. This is exactly what happened -- Nvidia stock is one of the greatest performers over the last decade, in large part because its revenue is almost 20 times larger today than it was in 2016 when the first AI supercomputer was delivered."

      "text": "Revenue is many things. Commonly known as sales, it\u2019s the top line of the income statement as well as a key financial metric that investors use to measure the financial health of a business. Like any financial metric, there are also rules underpinning the way it\u2019s measured and recorded, and investors should be familiar with these revenue recognition principles.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is revenue?\nPut simply, revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered. In some businesses, revenue is referred to as sales, though it can also come in the form of commissions, premiums, subscriptions, and credit card fees, as well as other channels, depending on the type of business in question.\nRevenue is often used as one way of measuring the size of a business, and investors tend to look at revenue growth as a reflection of a business\u2019s growth rate. Along with profits, or net income, revenue is generally one of the two most important metrics that investors look at in the income statement.\nUnderstanding revenue\nUnderstanding revenue\nRevenue might seem like a simple concept, but the way it\u2019s recorded isn\u2019t always straightforward, and how it\u2019s recorded often depends on the type of business.\nFor some businesses, like retail, revenue is typically recorded when a sale is made, but for other businesses, like software, it\u2019s more complicated. In accrual accounting, the basis for an income statement, revenue is recorded when a service is provided, not when it\u2019s paid for. So the timing of revenue recognition can differ significantly from the timing of cash collection, depending on the type of business and how customers pay their bills. In contract-based businesses like software, customers may pay up front for some products or pay after the services have been provided.\nAccrual accounting is designed to smooth out the lumps that are common in cash-based accounting, making revenue a useful indicator of how a business is performing. However, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on cash flow to make sure that revenue is being converted into cash.\nCash Flow\nHow to use it\nHow to use revenue\nRevenue is a valuable tool for investors, and there are a number of ways it plays into financial analysis. One common usage is in the price-to-sales ratio, which values a stock based on how the share price compares to revenue per share.\nFor profitable companies, investors typically prefer to use the price-to-earnings ratio, but the price-to-sales ratio can help complete the valuation picture since profit margins can vary from quarter to quarter, and profit growth relies on revenue growth. For companies in sectors like software that may not have profits, the price-to-sales ratio is especially valuable since it shows how expensive the stocks are and how they compare to others.\nRevenue growth is also a key metric for investors. In general, revenue growth is the best metric to use to assess a company\u2019s growth rate and potential. Although revenue has to ultimately translate into profits, a stock\u2019s value is closely tied to its top-line growth rate since that offers an indication of the demand for a company\u2019s products and its potential for expansion.\nRelated investing topics\nHow it's calculated\nHow revenue is calculated\nAt its most basic level, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by the quantity sold. If a restaurant sold 20 hamburgers for $10, its revenue would be $200.\nFor most companies, which have multiple product lines and different businesses, calculating revenue is more complex, and the underlying concept is straightforward. Revenue is money that comes in from normal business operations. That\u2019s separate from one-time gains like stock sales, legal proceeds, or interest income for non-financial companies.\nUnderstanding revenue is a valuable tool for any investor, especially as we look forward to the next bull market. Knowing the different ways that businesses recognize revenue is helpful for analyzing individual sectors. Comparing the cash flow statement with revenue is also important to make sure businesses are converting their revenue into cash.\nFinally, looking at metrics like the price-to-sales ratio and revenue growth can help guide your investments; both of those key metrics start with revenue."
