  "content": "Jackie Bezos, the mother of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, died on Thursday at her home in Miami at age 78.\n\nJeff Bezos shared the news on Instagram, saying she passed away surrounded by family after a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia.\n\nBezos said his his mother \u201cpounced on the job\u201d of loving him when she gave birth at age 17 and that for the rest of her life, the \u201clist of people to love never stopped growing. She always gave so much more than she ever asked for.\u201d\n\nIn an obituary published by the Bezos Family Foundation, the philanthropic organization started in 2000 by Jackie Bezos, her husband Mike and their children, Bezos is described as a devoted mother who made \u201ccountless trips to Radio Shack for Jeff.\u201d\n\nHer philanthropic pursuits included spearheading the 2016 opening of the Bezos Family Immunotherapy Clinic, a first-of-it\u2019s kind facility that was the result of a collaboration between the Fred Hutch Cancer Center and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.\n\nIn 2017, Jackei and Mike Bezos gave Fred Hutch $35 million on behalf of the family \u2014 at the time it was the single largest philanthropic commitment in the center\u2019s 41-year history. They easily eclipsed that number in 2022 with a \u201ctransformative\u201d $710.5 million gift.\n\n\u201cWhat we are really giving is the gift of time for all those people who will benefit from new treatments and cures,\u201d Jackie Bezos said in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s the gift of more hugs, more graduations and more moments.\u201d\n\nJacklyn Gise Bezos was born on Dec. 29., 1946, in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Jackie Bezos\n1946-2025\nTo the countless people she touched throughout a remarkable life, Jacklyn Gise Bezos was a fierce advocate and supporter, filled with heart for others, and never accepting the status quo.\nBorn December 29, 1946, Jackie died peacefully in her Miami home on August 14th, at the age of 78. A quiet final chapter to a life that taught all of us, friends and family alike, the true meaning of grit and determination, kindness, and service to others. Jackie was born to Lawrence Preston Gise and Mattie Louise Strait Gise in Washington, D.C. While she was growing up, the family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. During high school in Albuquerque, Jackie had her first child, Jeffrey.\nAs a young, single mom, Jackie was relentless \u2013 taking night school classes following high school and working in a bank by day. Her shift overlapped with a young Cuban immigrant who worked the night shift named Miguel (Mike) Bezos. The two fell in love and were married on April 5th, 1968, in what would be the beginning of a deep lifelong partnership across every aspect of their lives.\nJackie and Mike Bezos\nFor nearly 60 years, Jackie and Mike built a life grounded in love, mutual respect and shared joy. Through every chapter\u2014challenges and triumphs alike\u2014their devotion to one another never wavered. Their bond was a source of strength to their family and a beautiful example of enduring love.\nThe family grew quickly with the additions of Christina and Mark. Jackie was a devoted mother, always putting her children first. She made countless trips to Radio Shack for Jeff, spent numerous hours supervising cheerleading practices with Christina, and hauled drums in the back of the family station wagon for Mark. She dedicated her life to her family and poured her heart into raising her children with compassion, patience, and wisdom.\nJackie was not only a mother to her own children, but to many others as well. Over the years, her home became a welcoming gathering place for her children\u2019s friends. Jackie created a space where everyone felt safe, heard, and cared for. Whether offering a plate of food, a bit of advice or simply a listening ear, she had a remarkable way of making people feel like family.\nEducation was always important to Jackie. She believed deeply in the power of learning\u2014not only for her family, but for herself. In May of 1991 at the age of 45, she went back to school to finish what she had begun decades earlier, earning her Bachelor of Arts with High Honors in Psychology from Saint Elizabeth University in Morristown, New Jersey. Returning to college as an adult and pursuing her own education was just another example of Jackie\u2019s determination and grace. Her commitment to personal growth was an inspiration to all who knew her and a powerful reminder that it\u2019s never too late to follow your dreams.\nJackie\u2019s experiences as a mother and student shaped some of her life\u2019s most important work: the creation of the Bezos Family Foundation, which she founded with Mike, their children, and their families in 2000. At the Foundation, she devoted immense time and energy to two in-house programs: Vroom, a global early learning initiative that translates leading brain research into accessible, actionable tips to nurture children\u2019s growing minds, and the Bezos Scholars Program, which supports students in the United States and Africa.\nTogether, we can change the trajectory of an entire generation. We are not just building brains\u2014we are building the future. Each of us has a role to play, and it will take all of us to really make a difference.\nJackie Bezos\nBezos Family Immunotherapy Clinic opening at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center\nJackie\u2019s desire to help improve life for others extended well beyond the Foundation, and included large-scale charitable projects focused on medical research and community healthcare. Jackie\u2019s deep partnerships with Seattle\u2019s Fred Hutch Cancer Center helped lead to breakthrough immunotherapy treatments which use the body\u2019s own immune system to attack cancerous cells. Her support for immunotherapy treatment continues to lead to new advancements.\nJackie\u2019s life of service was second only to her passion for family and gathering. As a grandmother, Jackie found immense joy in watching her family grow. She passed down not only traditions and stories, but also her values\u2014kindness, resilience, and the importance of togetherness. Her legacy lives on in her grandchildren, who will carry forward her strength, love of storytelling and the deep sense of family she instilled in them. Few things made her happier than \u201cCamp Marmie,\u201d the camp she put on for her eleven grandchildren, gathering them all together each summer for an adventure filled with creative problem solving, laughter, and curiosity.\nIn 2020, Jackie was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia, a progressive neurological disorder that she battled with the same dignity and courage that shaped every aspect of her life. Mike, her husband and partner for more than a half century remained by her side at every step of this journey.\nJackie Bezos with families in Sunset Park, Brooklyn\nPhoto credit: Bud Glick Photography\nJackie is survived by her devoted husband, Mike, children Jeff (Lauren), Christina (Steve), Mark (Lisa), eleven grandchildren, and one great grandchild.\nAlthough Jackie may be gone from our sight, her love remains with us always\u2014a bright shining light that will never fade. She will be missed beyond words.\nThe family would like to acknowledge the dedicated and loving nurses and doctors who cared for Jackie with tenderness and devotion, as well as her many dear friends. We are deeply grateful.\nIn lieu of flowers, the family invites you to support a nonprofit organization that is meaningful to you or to perform a simple act of kindness in her memory."
