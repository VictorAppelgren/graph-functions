Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.\n\nToday's guest: Thushka Maharaj, Managing Director & Senior Global Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > GOOD MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE. RATE CUT OPTIMISM. STOCKS AND BONDS GAIN AS WEAKER THAN EXPECTED U.S. JOBS DATA SUMMITS BETS THE FED WILL EASE POLICY THIS MONTH. A SELLOFF IN CHINA INTENSIFIES ON REPORTS OF A CRACKDOWN ON SPECULATION. UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT JOINED EUROPEAN LEADERS IN PARIS AS VLADIMIR PUTIN SAYS A MEETING WITH BULLET AMIRA ZELINSKI SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN MOSCOW. APPLE SHARES JUMPED THE MOST OF A MONTH AFTER WE REPORTED THEY ARE PLANNING THEIR OWN AI POWERED WEBSITE TO BE LAUNCHED NEXT YEAR. THE PACKET -- THE BAD ECONOMIC NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS FOR MARKETS, STOCKS AND BONDS RALLYING. THE PRELUDE TO PAYROLL NUMBERS. THE MOOD CONTINUES IN THE ASIA SESSION, UP ZERO POINT 2% ON THE MSCI ASIA PACIFIC, PARING OUR EARLIER GAINS BECAUSE OF THE SELLOFF IN CHINA. FUTURES POINTING HIGHER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC. FLIPPED THE BOARD TO THE CROSS ASSET PICTURE, TREASURY SPACE, WE HAVE THE 30 YEAR TREASURY YIELD FLIRTING WITH THE 5% LEVEL, COMING AWAY A LITTLE FROM THAT NOW. WE HEARD FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR YESTERDAY, MORE HAWKISH THAN NORMAL AND WE HAVE THE POUND HIGHER BUT PARING SOME OF THOSE GAINS, 134. -- 1.34. BRENT ON THE BACK FOOT AT $67 PER BARREL, WORRIES ABOUT A SUPPLY GLUT IF OPEC-PLUS BOOSTS SUPPLY AGAIN AND GOLD, STILL AROUND THE RECORD HIGH BUT COMING OFF A BIT. IT IS ALL BACK TO THE FED CUT OPTIMISM. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ASIA. LET'S GO TO MARY FOR THAT. HERE IS A PROBLEM TO REPORT. WE HAVE CHINESE REGULATORS LOOKING AT MEASURES TO COOL STOCKS FROM THE DECADE HIGH BUT IS THE THREAT OF SPECULATION CURBS ENOUGH TO CONTROL THE FROTH? MARY: FOR NOW, THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING AND THAT IS THE REACTION WE ARE SEEING IN MARKETS TODAY. THE MARKETS HAVE HELD BACK AS A RESULT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT IN TERMS OF MARGIN FINANCING RISING AND CONCERNS ABOUT A LIQUIDITY DRIVEN RALLY AND POTENTIAL BUBBLES. YOU CAN SEE HOW POLICYMAKERS WERE GETTING CONCERNED, BUT IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT SORT OF MEASURES THEY ARE PLANNING IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MITIGATE THE RALLY, BECAUSE THERE IS STILL A LOT OF UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS THAT ARE SUPPORTED FOR CHINESE EQUITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE THE AI STORY THAT IS VERY STRONG. IF YOU LOOK AT EARNINGS, THEY ARE MIXED BUT IT LEANED HEAVILY TOWARDS THE SUPPORT FOR AI AND OF COURSE, YOU HAVE POLICY INITIATIVES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT CONSUMPTION. THERE ARE STILL SOME UNDERLYING SUPPORT FOR CHINESE EQUITIES BUT IT IS JUST ABOUT ENSURING IT DOESN'T GO TOO FAR, TOO FAST. AND CREATING BUBBLES AND CREATING CONCERN. LIZZY: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JAPANESE BOND AUCTION THIS MORNING. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE IS ANY DRAMA. MARY: NO DRAMA TODAY. IT WENT OFF PRETTY SMOOTHLY BUT I THINK THAT IS REALLY NOT THE END OF WHAT WE WILL SEE FOR JAPANESE BONDS IN TERMS OF ANY PAIN THEY ARE LIKELY TO SEE. IF YOU LOOK AT IT TOMORROW, THEY HAVE LABOR EARNINGS AND THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A LITTLE MORE ON THE HOTTER SIDE, AND OF COURSE IF IT MEANS THE BOJ DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AND ISN'T HIKING, THAT ADDS TO THE STAGFLATIONARY RISKS. NEXT WEEK YOU HAVE A LOT OF POLITICAL TENSIONS COMING THROUGH WITH THE LDP POTENTIALLY CALLING FOR AN ELECTION FOR A NEW LEADERSHIP. SO THERE IS A LOT OF HURDLES THE JAPANESE BOND MARKET WILL HAVE TO GET THROUGH. YOU HAVE THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING GLOBALLY, WHICH LEAVES JAPAN IN A SENSITIVE MOOD. OF COURSE, WE SEE THAT THE -- WITH THE YEN, THE YEN NOT FOLLOWING THE TRAJECTORY OF WHERE RATES ARE GOING IN TERMS OF DOLLAR-YEN AND YOU CAN SEE IT REMAINS ELEVATED, AND IT IS NOT FOLLOWING BECAUSE OF THAT POLITICAL RISK PREMIUM COMING THROUGH. THAT IS WEIGHING ON DOLLAR-YEN AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO WEIGH ON BONDS AS WELL. LIZZY: THEY YEN AT 1.48 PER DOLLAR. MARY, THANK YOU. STAYING IN THE BOND SPACE, BEARISH BETS ON TREASURIES GROWING, RAISING STAKES AROUND TOMORROW'S KEY U.S. EMPLOYMENT REPORT. THE FED SIGNALED HE THINKS CURRENT POLICY IS IN A GOOD PLACE. > > THE CURRENT MODESTLY RESTRICTIVE SETTING UP THE POLICY RATE IS CONSISTENT WITH TODAY'S FULL EMPLOYMENT LABOR MARKET AND A CORINTH ELATION AND CORE INFLATION NEARLY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE FED'S 2% TARGET. LOOKING AHEAD, I EXPECT THE LABOR MARKET TO GRADUALLY COOL AND REMAIN NEAR FULL EMPLOYMENT WITH RISKS TILTED TO THE DOWNSIDE. LIZZY: THAT IS NOT THE TONE OF ALL FOMC MEMBERS. VALERIE, WE HAD YESTERDAY'S JOB DATA CONFIRMING THE LABOR MARKET SLOWDOWN. COULD TOMORROW'S PAYROLL DATA OPEN THE DOOR FOR A 50 BASIS POINT RATE CUT? VALERIE: IF WE GET A PRINT THAT IS WEAK ENOUGH WE MIGHT HEAR THAT SPECULATION NEXT WEEK BUT IT WAS THE WEEK JOLTS DATA THAT SPURRED A BOND RALLY. YESTERDAY WE HAD 30 YEAR YIELDS COMING A WHISKER AWAY FROM 5%, NOW TRADING BELOW 4.9. WHEN IT CAME TO THE JOLTS YESTERDAY, SURPRISINGLY WEAK ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO LAYOFFS. COMMENTATORS SAYING CONSTRUCTION LAYOFFS WORK PARTICULARLY ACUTE, MANY SAYING THAT AS A LEADING INDICATOR THIS PLAYS INTO THE THOUGHT THE LABOR DEMAND IS COOLING AND MIGHT BE COOLING WEIGHT RAPIDLY. COMBINE THAT WITH THE FED BEIGE BOOK OUT YESTERDAY THAT SHOWED LITTLE TO NO ECONOMIC ACTIVITY PICKUP IN THE PREVIOUS MONTH. THIS PLAYS RIGHT INTO FED GOVERNOR WALLER'S HANDS. HE WAS ON CNBC YESTERDAY, THE MAIN DISSENTER AGAINST HOLDING RATES STEADY, SAYING HE FAVORS MULTIPLE CUTS IN THE MONTH AHEAD AND GAVE WARNINGS ON THE LABOR MARKET, SAYING YOU WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THE LABOR MARKET COOLING BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN IT TURNS, IT TURNS BAD FAST IN A NONLINEAR FASHION. WE MIGHT GET MORE DOVISH SPEAK TODAY FROM POTENTIAL FED CANDIDATES, HEARING FROM STEPHEN MIRON, HAVING A SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING TODAY, LIKELY TO PRESS THE FACT THAT TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE DEFLATIONARY AND THE FED SHOULD REMAIN, OR SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES. IN THE U.K. AND ACROSS EUROPE, THE BOND MARKET RALLY REALLY HAD A LOT OF IMPACT ON THE U.K. MAYBE THE BOND MARKET RALLY WAS EVEN LED BY THE U.K. YESTERDAY, 30 YEAR YIELDS DOWN BY NINE BASIS POINTS IN THE GILT MARKET. . ALSO SAW SOME SUBSTANTIAL RALLIES WHEN IT CAME TO LONG AND E.G. BEES ACROSS FRANCE AND ITALY, BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THE READ A CHART WHEN IT COMES TO THE GUILT. WE HAVE ALL BUT ERASED THE BACKUP IN YIELDS WE HAVE SEEN. NOW TRADING FLAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. HOUSE PRICES, HOW WEEKLY THE MARKET CAN TURN AROUND. LIZZY: THANKS, VALERIE. EUROPEAN FIXED INCOME, GOVERNOR ANDREW BAILEY PLAYING DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF LONG DATED GILT YIELDS, SAYING HE WOULD NOT EXAGGERATE SIGNIFICANCE OF 30 YEAR GUILT MOVES, CASTING OUT ON A RATE CUT THIS YEAR. > > I THINK THE PATH WILL CONTINUE TO BE DOWNWARDS GRADUALLY OVER TIME BECAUSE POLICY IS STILL RESTRICTIVE. BUT THERE IS NO CONSIDERABLY MORE DOUBT ABOUT WHEN AND HOW QUICKLY WE CAN MAKE THOSE FURTHER STEPS. > > LET'S WALK THROUGH THIS WITH THE EDITOR OF BLOOMBERG'S MARKETS TODAY LIVE BLOG. SHE JOINS US, GOOD MORNING. WE ARE LISTENING TO BAILEY CASTING DOUBT ON A RATE CUT. HOW HAWKISH IS THE REST OF THE MPC? > > SOME OF THE INTERESTING COMMENTS WERE FROM HAWKISH MEMBERS. AND MEGAN GREEN, SO THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION WHICH HAS BEEN PERSISTENT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND. THEY DO NOT WANT TO IMPACT GROWTH. THEY ARE TRYING TO BALANCE THIS IN TERMS OF RATE CUTTING AGENDA, SO THEY SAID RATES MAY NEED TO SETTLE BELOW 4%, WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY AT, AND THE MARKET HAS BEEN PARING BETS ON THE NOVEMBER RATE CUTS WHICH CONFIRMED THE MARKETS THINKING. THIS IS INTERESTING GIVEN THE RE-VOTE AT THE AUGUST RATE CUT SO IT SHOWS A BIT OF DISSENT AND CAUTIONM AND WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR MORE DATA TO SEE HOW THE THINKING WILL EVOLVE GOING FORWARD. THE VOTE, FOR A HOLD, BUT IF WE TURN TO THE FISCALM THE DRAMA HAPPENING AND FEEDING INTO YIELD MOVES. THE BUDGET WILL BE ON NOVEMBER 26 AND I HAVE TO WONDER, WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT PUSHED IT OUT SO LATE? WHEN YOU HAVE THESE YIELDS SO HIGH AND THE SPECULATION, EVER SINCE THE SPRING, ABOUT WHAT THE TAX RISES WOULD BE. KIT: THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION AND I GUESS IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS DOUBT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BACKDROP IN THE U.K.. . WE HAVE HAD MIXED DATA, INFLATION IS PERSISTENT AND GROWTH SEEMS TO BE LACKLUSTER. THE LABOR MARKET IS A BIG FOCUS. WE SAW WEAKNESS, BEEN STABILIZING, AND THIS IS NOT HELPED BY ISSUES OF HER DATA QUALITY FROM THE ONS, WHICH DID -- IT ADMITTED. THE GOVERNMENT PROBABLY WANTS TO SEE HOW THE PICTURE EVOLVED. THROW TERRACE INTO THE MIX AND THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THIS WILL IMPACT COMPANIES, FILTERING TO INDIVIDUALS AND THEY MAY WANT TO SEE HOW THE PICTURE EVOLVES, GET MORE CERTAINTY AND GET PAST CERTAIN EVENTS LIKE THE BANK OF ENGLAND MEETINGS, THE FED MEETINGS, ALL OF THOSE THINGS SO THAT IS WHY IT IS A LITTLE LATER IN THE YEAR. LIZZY: ANOTHER RISK THEY MAY NOT HAVE SEEN COMING, THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FIGHTING FOR HER POLITICAL LIFE, HAVING ADMITTED SHE IS UNDERPAID PROPERTY TAXES. HOW MUCH IS POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY GOING TO CAUSE RETURNS -- CONCERNS FOR MARKETS? KIT: MARKETS DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY. AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS PLAY OUT IN THE MARKETS. THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE 30 YEAR YIELD. THE HIGHEST, IT IS CONCERNING AND IF WE LOOK OVER THE SUMMER, MARKETS HAVE BEEN IN A LONG. FTSE 100 HAS BEEN OF RECORD. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT PLAY OUT BUT IF WE DO SEE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OVER LEADERSHIP AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE PROBE, WE COULD SEE MOVES BUT AT THE MOMENT, THE FOCUS IS ON THE FISCAL BACKDROP AND MONETARY POLICY AND THIS WILL PROBABLY DOMINATE FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST. LIZZY: SO MUCH TO BE WATCHING IN THE U.K. KIT IS THE EDITOR OF OUR LIVE BLOG. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU LOOK AT IT. PLENTY MORE ON THE DOCKET. 7:30 A.M. LONDON TIME, SWISS INFLATION NUMBERS DROPPING, EXPECTED TO HAVE STALLED IN AUGUST. AT 1:30 LONDON TIME, U.S. JOBLESS CLAIMS ADDING TO THE JOLTS YESTERDAY IN THE DRUMBEAT UP TO THE PAYROLLS REPORT TOMORROW, AND AT 3:00 P.M. LONDON TIME CAN BE U.S. ISM SERVICE NUMBERS EXPECTED TO HAVE BEEN EXPANDED AT ABOUT THE SAME PACE AS JULY. THE STORIES YOU NEED TO KNOW IN TODAY'S EDITION OF DAYBREAK. ON THIS PROGRAM, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SHOULD MEET HIM IN MOSCOW AS U.K.'S ALLIES -- UKRAINE'S ALLIES PREPARE FOR PARIS. THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER IS SET TO HOLD HIS FINAL MEETINGS WITH OPPOSITION PARTIES BEFORE MONDAY'S CONFIDENCE VOTE. WE WILL DISCUSS THE MARKET IMPACT LATER IN THE PROGRAM SO STAY WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LIZZY: I'M BACK TO BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE. EUROPEAN LEADERS EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT RUSSIA WILL MOUNDS -- MOUNT A NEW OFFENSIVE ON UKRAINE. THIS COMES AS RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS ZELENSKYY SHOULD MEET HIM IN MOSCOW. > > IT IS A PATH TO KNOW WHERE TO MEET WITH THE CURRENT HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION, TO PUT IT CAREFULLY. IT IS POSSIBLE. . I NEVER REJECTED IT. THERE MAY BE POSSIBLE RESULTS. DONALD ASKED ME IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HOLD SUCH A MEETING. I SAID YES, IT IS POSSIBLE. IF ZELENSKYY IS READY HE SHOULD COME TO MOSCOW AND THE MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE. LIZZY: OUR EUROPE CORRESPONDENT HAS THE LATEST. SURELY ZELENSKYY WOULD NEVER SET FOOT IN RUSSIA. > > A LOT TO UNPACK FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO FROM THE FIRST DAYS OF THE WAR, WHEN THERE WERE REPORTS OF HIT SQUADS GOING AROUND TRYING TO FIND ZELENSKYY, IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE ZELENSKYY GOING TO MOSCOW, PARTICULARLY WHEN PUTIN SAYS NOTHING CAN BE ACHIEVED IN A CONVERSATION WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION IN UKRAINE. WE HAVE SEEN BASICALLY THE NEW ZELENSKYY TACTIC SINCE THE CATASTROPHIC OVAL OFFICE VISIT, WHATEVER TRUMP SAYS JOB HE SAYS HOW HI AND THEN GOES EVEN FURTHER. THERE WERE DISCUSSION ABOUT A POTENTIAL MEETING IN TURKEY. ZELENSKYY GOT ON THE PLANE AND SET ON HERE IN TURKEY READY TO MEET PUTIN. MAYBE IN THE SHOWMANSHIP, THAT IS SOMETHING YOU WOULD CONSIDER BUT IT IS A VERY HARD TO IMAGINE SUCH A THING BUT THE MAIN AUDIENCE HERE IS DONALD TRUMP. THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER DONALD TRUMP SEES THERE BEING PROGRESS WITH RUSSIA AND HOW HE FEELS ABOUT PUTIN AT THE MOMENT, WHAT HE WAS ASKED YESTERDAY AND THE PRESS CONFERENCE. HAVE A LISTEN TO WHAT TRUMP HAD TO SAY. > > I HAVE NO MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT PUTIN. HE KNOWS WHERE I STAND AND I WILL MAKE A DECISION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. WHATEVER HIS DECISION, I WILL BE UNHAPPY OR HAPPY AND IF WE ARE UNHAPPY, YOU WILL SEE THINGS HAPPEN. OLIVER: THERE IS ALREADY SOME UNHAPPINESS DISPLAYED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN THE 50% TARIFFS PUT ON INDIA FOR CONTINUING TO BUY RUSSIAN CRUDE. TRUCK -- TRUMP INDICATED THIS IS A -- THE FIRST PHASE IN RAMPING UP PRESSURE ON RUSSIA. WE ARE REACHING A MOMENT WHERE PUTIN IS BEING EMBRACED MANY PLACES ON THE GLOBAL STAGE. YOU SAW HIM IN CHINA, AT THE MILITARY PARADE EMBRACING KIM JONG-UN, HOLDING HANDS WITH NARENDRA MODI. WE KNOW TRUMP IS OBSERVING THIS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER AS THE EUROPEANS THINK PUTIN IS PLAYING GAMES AND NOT BEING SERIOUS ABOUT ADVANCING A PEACE PROCESS IN YOU RAIN -- UKRAINE. LIZZY: WHO COULD FORGET THE HANDHOLD MOMENT AND TRUMP BRISTLING ABOUT WHY HE HADN'T PUT MORE PRESSURE ON PUTIN SINCE ALASKA. WE HAVE A COALITION OF THE WILLING BETWEEN EUROPEAN LEADERS TODAY. WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM THAT? OLIVER: THAT IS SHARED BY EMMANUEL MACRON AND KEIR STARMER IN PARIS, THE BROAD COALITION OF EUROPEAN NATIONS TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT THE DAY AFTER LOOKS LIKE IN UKRAINE. PART OF IT IS TRYING TO PUT PRESSURE ON RUSSIA BUT IT IS THE IDEA OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND A BACKSTOP FORCE THAT COULD BE WITHIN UKRAINE TO GUARANTEE THERE IS NO FURTHER INCURSION BY THE RUSSIANS ON AN -- UKRAINE IN THE EVENT OF A PEACE NEGOTIATION. WHAT IS THE COALITION OF THE WILLING WILLING TO DO? WE HAVE NOT HAD THE CAN'T IS OF WHAT A PEACEKEEPING WOULD LOOK LIKE, WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE, WHAT THE FUNCTION IS BUT IT BE DISCUSSED IN PARIS. THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT A PEACEKEEPING FORCE IS, ARE IRRELEVANT IF THERE IS NO PEACE AND NO ADVANCEMENT TOWARDS PEACE WHICH IS WHY THEY WILL TRY TO GET DONALD TRUMP ON THE PHONE, AS THEY DID AT THE LAST MEETING A FEW MONTHS AGO TO STRATEGIZE AND SEE IF THEY CAN GET HIM ON BOARD. LIZZY: WE HAVE HAD PRESIDENT TRUMP MEETING THE POLISH PRESIDENT YESTERDAY IN WASHINGTON. HE IS A POPULIST, THE POLISH PRESIDENT. WAS THAT CONVERSATION A GOOD OMEN FOR A POTENTIAL U.S.-BACKED BACKSTOP FOR UKRAINE? OLIVER: WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND THE POLISH PRESIDENT, THIS IS A RIGHT WING CANDIDATE THAT SURPRISINGLY WON THE POLISH ELECTION, OUT OF STEP WITH DONALD TUSK AND THE PRO-EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BUT IT IS A MIXED BLESSING FOR EUROPEANS. THEY MAY BE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND BUT HE IS ALIGNED WITH DONALD TRUMP. WHEN HE GOT FROM TRUMP IS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE UNDERVALUED, THE IDEA OF THE TRUMP SAID HE IS WILLING NOT ONLY TO NOT TAKE ANY OF THE U.S. TROOPS OUT OF POLAND, HE IS WILLING TO DEPLOY MORE TROOPS TO PORTLAND -- TO POLAND IF THE POLISH WANT THAT. THE U.S. AND THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WILL DO IT -- A STRATEGIC REVIEW OF THE MILITARY GLOBAL PRESENCE OF THE FEAR FOR EUROPEANS IS THAT THEY WILL DETRACT AND PULL FORCES OUT OF EUROPE. THERE ARE 85,000 U.S. TROOPS ACROSS EUROPE, 40,000 IN GERMANY AND TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY ALTHOUGH WE MAY BE MOVING TROOPS FROM OTHER PLACES, WE WILL ARE WILLING TO COMMIT MORE TROOPS TO POLAND AND THAT IS WELCOME FROM THE POLISH AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AS WELL. LIZZY: THE POLISH PRESIDENT MAY BE A BRIDGE TO WASHINGTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE LATEST NEWS HEADLINES. COMING UP, WE WILL TURN TO ATTACK. APPLE IS -- WE WILL TURN TO TECH. APPLE IS TRYING TO RIVAL OPENAI. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LIZZY: THE BACK. 6:24 IN LONDON. APPLE SHARES JUMPING THE MOST OF THE MONTH AFTER WE REPORTED THE TECH GIANT IS PLANNING TO LAUNCH AN AI POWERED WEB SEARCH TOOL INTEGRATED INTO SIRI AND IT WOULD AIM TO COMPETE WITH OPENAI AND PERPLEXITY. ANNABELLE JOINS US FROM HONG KONG. WALK US THROUGH WHAT THIS NEW SYSTEM OFFERS. HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM CHATGPT? ANNABELLE: I THINK IT IS PROBABLY, WHAT APPLE WANTS IS IT TO BE SIMILAR TO CHATGPT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, APPLE HAS BEEN BEHIND ON INTEGRATED GENERATED AI SO THEY NEED TO PLAY CATCH UP. THE NEW SYSTEM IS ABOUT TO BE INTEGRATED OR WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE SIRI VOICE ASSISTANT SO KNOWN INTERNALLY AS WORLD KNOWLEDGE ANSWERS, WHICH GIVES YOU A CLUE BUT THE IDEA IS THE THINGS YOU MIGHT ASK CHATGPT, YOU MIGHT ASK SIRI. SO THIS IS MULTIMODAL, WHETHER IT IS TEXT, PHOTO, VIDEO, LOCAL POINTS OF INTEREST. THERE WILL BE A SUMMARY SYSTEM SO YOU CAN GET THINGS MORE QUICKLY DIGESTIBLE. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT SIRI IS SOMETHING HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 2011, CONSIDERED GROUNDBREAKING AT THE TIME BUT TODAY IT CAN'T GO BEYOND ANSWERING BASIC QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS THE WEATHER? APPLE NEEDS TO DO MORE WITH THIS AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE IT IS SEEN AS A LEADER. LIZZY: I ME ABOUT IT. IT JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND MY ACCENT. WHERE WILL THE UNDERLYING TECH COME FROM TO POWER IT? ANNABELLE: IT WILL COME FROM ALPHABET. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM SOURCES. GOOGLE AND APPLE HAVE A LONG-STANDING PARTNERSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO INTERNET SEARCH. WE HAVE HEARD THEY HAVE REACHED A FORMAL AGREEMENT THIS WEEK WHERE APPLE WILL BE ABLE TO EVALUATE WHAT A GOOGLE DEVELOPED AI SYSTEM FOR SIRI WOULD LOOK LIKE. THE TIMING IS INTERESTING BECAUSE YESTERDAY WE SPOKE ABOUT A RULING FROM THE U.S. JUDGE THAT SAID APPLE CAN MAINTAIN AN AGREEMENT THE NEXT GOOGLE THE DEFAULT SEARCH ON ITS ENGINE, OR DEFAULT SEARCH ENGINE ON ITS DEVICES BUT DURING THE TRIAL APPLE TESTIFIED THAT THEY ARE SEEING LESS GOOGLE SEARCHES, WHICH PUTS PRESSURE ON, THEY NEED TO GET THE AI SYSTEM IN PLACE QUICKLY. LIZZY: WE KNOW APPLE'S FIRST CHOICE WAS NOT GOOGLE. WHY DID APPLE GO WITH GOOGLE IN THE END? ANNABELLE: THIS IS INTERESTING. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS, ANTHROPIC WAS THE INITIAL FIRST CHOICE BECAUSE APPLE DID INTERNAL CALCULATIONS OR VALUATIONS AND FOUND CLAUDE, FROM ANTHROPIC, WAS MORE AHEAD OF GEMINI, GOOGLE'S ANSWER. ANTHROPIC WAS PERHAPS THE FRONT RUNNER BUT IT CAME DOWN TO PRICE. ANTHROPIC APPARENTLY WAS ASKING FOR $1.5 BILLION PER YEAR AND GOOGLE WAS A LITTLE MORE OPEN TO MORE FAVORABLE FINANCIAL TERMS. LIZZY: ANNABELLE, ALSO HOST OF BLOOMBERG TECH ASIA, THANK YOU FOR WALKING US THROUGH THAT. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, FOUR DAYS AHEAD OF FRENCH PRIME MINISTER EMMANUEL MACRON -- FRENCH PRIME MINISTER'S -- THE IMPACT OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS ON THE MARKET. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LIZZY: THIS IS BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE, I'M LIZZY BURDEN IN LONDON AND THESE OF THE STORIES THAT SET YOUR AGENDA. STOCKS AND BONDS GAIN AFTER WEAKER THAN EXPECTED U.S. JOB STATUS IMMENSE BET ON THE JOB RATING LATER THIS MONTH BUT A SELLOFF IN CHINA INTENSIFIES ON REPORTS OF A CRACKDOWN ON STOCK MARKET SPECULATION. U.K.'S PRESIDENT JOINS EUROPEAN LEADERS IN PARIS AS VLADIMIR PUTIN SAYS THAT THE MEETING WITH VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN MOSCOW. PLUS, APPLE SHARES JUMPED THE MOST IN THE MONTH AFTER WE REPORT THAT IT'S PLANNING ITS OWN AI POWERED WEB SEARCH TO BE LAUNCHED NEXT YEAR. IF YOU'RE JOINING US, GOOD MORNING TO YOU. WE HAVE BAD NEWS YESTERDAY FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY BUT IT PROVED GOOD NEWS FOR THESE MARKETS. THE PRELUDE TO PAYROLLS. PROMPTING FED DATA TO RAMP UP BET AND STOCKS AND BONDS RISING OFF THE BAT. ASIAN EQUITIES FOLLOWING SUIT UP .2% ON THE MSCI PACIFIC INDEX. PAIRING THE GAINS AS THE CHINESE SELLOFF DEEPENS. YOU'VE ALSO GOT FUTURES POINTING HIGHER, A TOUCH HIGHER. THESE ARE SMALL MOVES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC. FLIP THE BOARD TO THE CROSS ASSET PICTURE AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE YIELDS PICTURE, 30 YEAR TREASURY YIELD AT 48978. THE POUND AT 134. AS WE WERE HEARING FROM KIT REESE THAT THE POUND PARING SOME OF ITS GAINS NOW. OIL AT $67 A BARREL, SECOND DAY OF LOSSES GOLDMAN SAYING HE COULD DROP TO THE LOW 50'S ON THE GLOBAL SURPLUS $67 A BARREL. GOLD COULD DROP ON THE GLOBAL SURPLUS. LET'S GET TO THE FRENCH POLITICS, THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING THAT HE REMAINS OPEN TO ALTERNATIVE BUDGET PROPOSALS AS LONG AS THE OVERALL DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGET REMAINS IN PLACE. HE HAS CALLED THE PARLIAMENTARY VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FROM MONDAY ON THE OPPOSITION PARTIES ARE HOLDING A COMBINED MAJORITY OF THE SEATS IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SAYING THEY PLAN TO VOTE AGAINST THE MOTION WHICH WOULD FORCE THE RESIGNATION. FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED BY -- SHE WAS MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO GLOBAL STRATEGIST OVER AT JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND AT SUCH A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU WITH ME THIS MORNING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING TIME. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MONDAY'S NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE. THE POLLING MARKET OUGHT SUGGEST THAT IT IS TOES, BUT WHERE DOES IT LEAVE THE FISCAL SITUATION. ARE WE GOING TO SEE A WIDER DEFICIT? > > GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON. I DO AGREE WITH YOUR POINT THAT WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE RESOLUTION AFTER MONDAY. OUR CENTRAL FORECAST IS FOR ONGOING CERTAINTY IN A THREE WAY SPLITTING AND PARLIAMENT PREVENTING SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM. THE OVERALL DIRECTION IS TOWARDS GRADUAL DEFICIT REDUCTION IN FRANCE. I WOULD SAY TO OTHER KEY POINTS TO MAKE HERE. WE SHOULD EXPECT THE DEFICIT TO REMAIN HIGH, RELATIVE TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. BUT SECONDLY, THIS IS NOT JUST A FRENCH PHENOMENON. WE'VE SEEN GLOBAL CONCERNS ON FISCAL DEBT, WHETHER IT'S THE U.S., WHETHER IT'S EUROPE AND EVEN THE U.K. AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER. LIZZY: IS THE FRENCH SITUATION WORSE THAN THE U.K.? IS FRANCE THE NEW ITALY? > > FRANCE COMPARED TO ITALY HAS MORE ROOM TO CONSOLIDATE ITS DEFICIT. I THINK THAT'S VERY FAIR. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT TOTAL ASSETS HELD BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT, THEY ARE OVER 50% AND THAT IS BETTER THAN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. OVERALL, WE LOOK ACROSS THE U.K., THE FRENCH, FRANCE AS WELL AS ITALY DEBT LEVELS ARE HIGH ACROSS THE BOARD. IT'S NOW ABOUT WILLINGNESS OR CONFIDENCE BY INVESTORS ON THE ABILITY FOR THESE GOVERNMENTS TO CONSOLIDATE. ULTIMATELY WE EXPECT THAT GROWTH IMPROVES AND THE EURO AREA. GROWTH IMPROVES AND THE U.K. AND THAT HELPS IMPROVE DEFICITS. THAT'S NOT AN ACTIVE FORM OF CONSOLIDATION. THAT WILL TAKE MORE TIME. WHAT HAPPENS POST MONDAY, WE STILL EXPECT THE DEFICIT TARGET TO BE AROUND 5%, THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE BUT WE WILL END UP WITH A PLAN TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT OVER A GRADUAL AMOUNT OF TIME. WHAT WAS REASSURING FOR US FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE IS WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS CONTAGION OF THE FRENCH POLITICAL RISK INTO THE WIDER EUROPEAN BOND MARKETS. THAT IS BECAUSE WE SEE THIS FOCUS OF FRANCE, BUT THE GROWTH OUTLOOK IN THE EURO AREA IS LIKELY TO IMPROVE NEXT YEAR AND I THINK THE MARKET IS PUTTING SOME CONFIDENCE IN THAT AS WELL. > > LET'S PLAY OUT -- LIZZY: LET'S PLAY OUT THE SCENARIOS. ONE OF PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON CALL SNAP ELECTIONS AND RESIGNS? THE SPREADS HAVE CLOSED YESTERDAY ABOUT 80 BASIS POINTS, 80 EXACTLY. WHERE WOULD HE GO TO IF HE DID THAT? > > I THINK HAVING SNAP ELECTIONS WOULD FORCE SPREADS BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE IN THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN OF LAST YEAR WHICH IS CLOSER TO 90 TO 100 BASIS POINTS. IT POSSIBLY COULD CROSS OUT 100 BASIS POINT LEVEL BUT I THINK RESIGNATION OF THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER IS MORE LIKELY, IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT YOU WILL SEE A CHANGE IN THE PRESIDENT AT THIS POINT. ON A MEDIUM-TERM BASIS WE DO SEE VALUE IN EUROPEAN FIXED INCOME. INCLUDING FRANCE, I WOULD ARGUE, DESPITE THIS POLITICAL RISK. WE HAVE THE ECB HAVING CUT RATES, WE HAVE THIS IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROWTH OUTLOOK AND OVERALL GROWTH IN THE EURO AREA CLOSER TO TREND. IT DOES MAKE US MORE POSITIVE, I WOULD SAY MORE SO IN ITALY AND SPAIN AND FRANCE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, BUT WE DO SEE VALUE BEING CREATED IN THIS POLITICAL INSURGENCY. LIZZY: WHAT SORT OF SPREAD WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR A MAJOR LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE? WOULD IT BE 100 BASIS, WHAT LEVEL OF IT TAKE FOR THE ECB TO STEP IN AND INTERVENE? > > I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE ECB'S STEPS IN WITH THE TPI FOR THE TRANSMISSION PROTECTION INSTRUMENTS. THAT'S A VERY LOW PROBABILITY EVENT. A BECAUSE THIS CAN BE DEALT WITH IN FRANCE. BE, IT WON'T BE SPREAD LEVEL IN ISOLATION DEPENDENT. THAT WILL NOT BE THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF WHETHER WE HAVE INTERVENTION. THE VOLATILITY IS ONGOING VOLATILITY IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS SPREADS CONTINUE WIDENING. THAT WOULD BE A CONCERN. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN DE-RISKING BY INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS OF FRENCH CLOTH AND THAT HASN'T CREATED THIS MASS WIDENING AND FRENCH BREADS. SO, A, WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FORWARD OUTLOOK WE SEE A BRIGHTENING PICTURE, BUT VOLATILITY IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE. LIZZY: WE HAVE THE NEXT MAJOR RATING AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT COMING FROM FITCH, IT'S ON FRIDAY, NEXT FRIDAY, ARE THEY GOING TO DOWNGRADE WHEN THEY'VE ALREADY GOT FRIENDS -- FRANCE ON NEGATIVE? > > THAT IS A RISK EVENT, THE MARKET IS AWARE. SPREADS, AS YOU SAID, THEY HAVE REPRICED. WE HAVE SEEN THE MARKET PRICING IN THE DEFICIT CONCERN. BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTIONS THAT ARE LIKELY TO COME OUT AT THE END OF THIS WEEK, WE WON'T SAY THAT THAT WOULD BE MORE OF A REPETITION THAT THEY WOULD SAY SO FAR WAITING FOR THAT CLARITY POST THE VOTE. I THINK THEY HAVE ALREADY BUILT INTO THE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE A RESOLUTION ON THE GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. BUT I THINK THE CRUCIAL VOTE FOR FRENCH RATINGS IS ARE WE GOING OUT OF 5.5 DEFICIT AND THEREAFTER FURTHER CONSOLIDATION ARE WE GOING FROM A FIVE POINT 4% DEFICIT TO SOMETHING WIDER. THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CALCULUS FOR RATING AGENCIES. WE WILL SEE GRADUAL CONSOLIDATION. LIZZY: GREAT TO GET YOUR INSIGHTS. APPRECIATE YOU GETTING UP EARLY FOR ME. DIRECTOR OF SENIOR -- SENIOR GLOBAL STRATEGIST AT JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, GOOD TO SEE YOU. I WANT TO ZOOM OUT A BID AND DIVE MORE DEEPLY INTO THE BOND SPACE BECAUSE THERE WAS A REPRIEVE FOR TREASURIES YESTERDAY AFTER THAT JOB STATUS STATESIDE PROMPTED THEM TO HEDGE THEIR BETS ON TWO FED CUTS THIS YEAR. BUT OVER THE PAST YEAR LONG AND YIELDS HAVE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIGHER. JAMIE RUSH FROM BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS ARGUES THAT THOSE HIGHER ALONG IN BOND YIELDS ARE HERE TO STAY. JAMIE IS HERE WITH US NOW. JUST TELL US MORE ABOUT YOUR CALL. JAMIE: I THINK WE ARE THINKING MORE ABOUT THE LONGER-TERM YEAR. SO RIGHT NOW, WITH STICKY INFLATION, WIDE BUDGET DEFICIT, PUBLIC FINANCE IS FIRMLY IN MIND, IT'S CLEAR TO SEE THERE'S LOTS OF ACTION IN THE LONG END OF THE CURVE. AND THAT'S BEING COMPOUNDED AND INTENSIFIED. LIKE WHAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN FRANCE, JAPAN AND OF COURSE IN THE U.K. THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE AND THEY ARE SUFFERING A LOT. I THINK IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE STRUCTURAL FORCES THAT DRIVE INTEREST RATES, IT COMES DOWN TO THE BALANCE BETWEEN GLOBAL SAVING AND GLOBAL INVESTMENT. IN ONE OF THE FORCES THAT HELP PUSH INTEREST RATES DOWN OVER THE PAST 30-40 YEARS ARE STARTING TO WANE. AND A LOT OF THE ONES ARE HELPING TO STIMULATE INVESTMENT OR HELPING THE PUSH UP. SO OUR VIEW IS THAT, YES, INTEREST RATES ARE LIKELY TO STAY HIGHER EVEN AS THE FED CONTINUES TO CUT, SO THE 10 YEAR TREASURIES IN PARTICULAR MIGHT STAY HIGH. LIZZY: IN THE SHORT TERM YOU COULD ARGUE WE ARE IN DANGER OF CONFLATING WHAT FOR FRENCH BONDS IS A FISCAL STORY AND FOR U.S. TREASURIES IS A FED STORY. FOR YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT ALL ROADS POINT IN THE SAME DIRECTION, HIGHER YIELDS. > > IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE GLOBE AND YOU LOOK AT A SLIGHTLY EARLIER ASSURANCE RATE, THE PATTERN IS CONTAINED. 30 YEARS THE PATTERN IS BASICALLY EVERY COUNTRY HAS BEEN HIT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE WHO ARE EXTREMELY FISCALLY PRUDENT, LIKE SWITZERLAND. SO THERE IS AN UNDERLYING FORCE IN FOR DRIVERS, YOU COULD THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF FALLING INTEREST RATES AND WHETHER THEY WILL GO FORWARD THINKING ABOUT DEMOGRAPHICS. YOU HAD THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION SOCKING AWAY THEIR PAYCHECKS INTO THEIR SAVINGS, NOW THEY ARE STARTING TO RETIRE AND THEY WILL PULL THOSE SAVINGS OUT. LESS SAVINGS, HIGHER INTEREST RATES. YOU ABOUT AI, THE CAPITAL INTENSITY OF AIN RUSHING TO INVEST IN IT IS CREATING EXTRA COMPETITION FOR FIRMS -- FUNDS AND TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS WITH THE SAME PRICE. THAT'S NOT THE REASON WHY INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP. THAT'S BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO SOME OF THE BIGGER QUESTIONS ABOUT GEOPOLITICS, SO THINK ABOUT DEFENSE SPENDING THAT'S GOING UP, IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE RIFT BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S., THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE INTEREST RATES HIGHER. LIZZY: YOU'VE BEEN WRITING ABOUT THIS IN YOUR NEW BOOK, THE PRICE OF MONEY. YOU'VE WRITTEN IT WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES. YOU SAY THAT 4.5% 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD'S IS THE NEW NORMAL, BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER, WITH ALL OF THOSE FACTORS IN MIND, COULD IT GO? > > IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE RISKS, THE BIG ONES ARE THE GOVERNMENT JUST COMPLETELY FAILED TO GET ON TOP OF THEIR DEFICITS. WE HAVE SEEN NO APPETITE ACROSS THE HOUSE IN THE U.S., THEY SEEN THE PROBLEMS YEAR OF HAVING FRACTURED POLITICS WHICH MEANS YOU CAN GET ON TOP OF THE DEFICIT IN FRANCE OR IN THE U.K. , SO CLEARLY, DEBT IS A MAJOR, MAJOR FACTOR, DEFENSE SPENDING IS ANOTHER ONE, WE USED TO THINK WE LIVED IN A SAFE WORLD, WE DON'T LIVE IN A SAFE WORLD. INVESTMENT IN MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO UP. IT WILL COST MONEY AND PUSH UP INTEREST RATES. AND WE TALK ABOUT AI, THE PROMISE OF THIS FUN TECHNOLOGY REALLY LIVES UP TO EXPECTATION WITH A LOT OF MONEY SPENT ON STUFF TO ACCOMMODATE IT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT ADDING THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER AND GETTING TO TREASURY YIELDS A 5.5 PERCENT AND ABOVE, IT'S POSSIBLE. A LOT OF THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR THAT TO PLAY OUT, BUT THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL GIVEN THE RISK AROUND THOSE THREE THINGS IS BASICALLY NORTH OF IT. SO THAT'S THE INDICATION. LIZZY: 42140 EIGHT IS WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW. JAMIE RUSH, OUR DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL ECONOMICS AT BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS, THE PRICE OF MONEY PUBLISHED NEXT MONTH AND JAMIE CAN POP MY COPY ON MY DESK.

FTSE RUSSELL SAYS THAT THE LUXURY GOODS FIRM KNOWN FOR ITS TRENCH COATS WILL REJOIN THE FTSE 100 LATER THIS MONTH. ENERGY AND METALS JOINS BURBERRY AND BEING PROMOTED. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN HAVE AN AFTERMATH AFTER A CHECKERED PAST. 14 YEARS AGO BILLIONAIRE JOHN CALDWELL MADE SURE -- MADE WHAT WAS SURE TO BE A SUREFIRE BET, OR SO IT LOOK LIKE, SPLASHING UP ON 100 43 MILLION TOWN CAR PART ON A PRIME PART OF ROOTSY MAYFAIR IN A PLAN TO BUILD A LUXURY APARTMENT BLOCK BUT THE ENTREPRENEUR'S LOFTY AMBITIONS ARE COLLIDING NOW WITH THE WERE SLOW DOWN AND LUXURY PROPERTY MARKERS -- MARKET SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. FOR MORE LET'S BRING IN BLOOMBERG'S DAMIEN SHEPARD, OUR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE REPORTER. DAMIEN, THANKS FOR JOINING ME. TALK TO ME ABOUT WHY THIS PROJECT SEEMED LIKE A SUREFIRE BET FOR CALDWELL? > > IT'S WORTH US REWINDING 15 YEARS FOR THE LONDON LUXURY PROPERTY MARKET WAS LOOKING BETTER THAN IT IS NOW. JOHN CALDWELL HAD BECOME A BILLIONAIRE AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO SPEND YOUR MONEY THAN TO BUY THE MOST EXPENSIVE CAR PARK IN THE U.K. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. HE HAS THESE PLANS TO TURN IT INTO AN APARTMENT BLOCK WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE FLAT POTENTIALLY IN THE WORLD. LIZZY: IT'S LIKE PLAYING MONOPOLY. > > EXACTLY. SINCE THEN WE'VE SEEN A ROLLER COASTER. WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW IN 2011 WHEN HE BOUGHT THE CAR PARK WAS AT THE MARKET WAS ABOUT TO PEAK. SINCE THEN WE'VE SEEN ALL SORTS OF DAMAGE TO LONDON'S LUXURY HOUSING MARKET AND CONCERNING THE FOR CALDWELL IT MIGHT BE ABOUT TO GET WORSE AS HE SEES LOW DEMAND FOR HIS UNITS IN A CONSTANT MOVE OF THE GOALPOST WITH WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION WILL ACTUALLY BE COMPLETED. LIZZY: WHY HAS THE MARKET GONE SO SOUR SINCE THEN? THINKING ABOUT THE DEPARTURE OF RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS. QUAKES ARE SO MANY REASONS. IF WE GO BACK A FEW YEARS, ABOUT A DECADE AGO, AND WEALTH TEXAS IT HAD A MASSIVE IMPACT ON DEMAND AND THE LONDON MARKET. THE POST GFC INTEREST RATES WERE SO LOW THAT BORROWING WAS EASY FOR THESE ULTRARICH POTENTIAL RESIDENTS OF THE U.K. THAT CAME OVER AND SPLASHED OUT A LUXURY RESIDENTIAL. AND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MORE RECENTLY HIKES UNDER THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT, THE END OF THE REGIME YOU SEEN THE LAST MONTH THE GOVERNMENT KITE FLYING IDEAS AROUND NEW TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY WHEN THEY ARE SELLING THEIR HOMES, POTENTIAL CHANGES TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX. ALL OF THIS CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT THE MARKET HATES. THAT'S WHY WE ARE SEEING SUCH LOW DEMAND FOR THESE AND THAT'S WHY CALDWELL HAS A BIT OF A HEADACHE AT THE MOMENT. LIZZY: REALLY HELPFUL BACKGROUND BRINGING IT UP TO THE PRESENT, WHAT ARE BROKER'S VIEWS ON WHY IT IS IN GETTING THAT STRONG DEMAND? > > BROKERS ARE TELLING ME THAT CALDWELL IS PRICING THE APARTMENTS TOO HIGH. THIS ISN'T JUST AN ISSUE FOR CALDWELL. THERE'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER EXPECTATIONS. ALL OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID ABOUT THE MARKET COMING DOWN. THE PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WHO OWN THESE PROPERTIES AND ARE DEVELOPING THESE PROPERTIES IS THAT THEY STRUGGLE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT WHAT THEIR HOUSE USED TO BE WORTH OR WHAT THEY WANTED THEIR NEW BUILD DEPARTMENTS TO BE WORTH ISN'T REALISTIC, SO THE BROKERS ARE TELLING ME THAT THE PRICING IS NOT AT THE LEVEL IT SHOULD BE TO ATTRACT THE DEMAND FOR THE UNITS. SO THAT'S THE PRIMARY ISSUE AND THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE FOR CALDWELL. HE NEEDS TO BREAK ISSUE -- BREAK EVEN ON THE PROJECT. FOR HIM THE PRICING IS CRUCIAL. RIGHT NOW I'M BEING TOLD IS TOO HIGH. LIZZY: YOU SHARE MY FAVORITE HOBBY, LOOKING AT PROPERTIES ONLINE IN YOUR SPARE TIME AND THAT'S MY OBSERVATION, A BIG GAP BETWEEN WHAT SELLERS WANT AND WHAT PROPERTIES ARE ACTUALLY WORTH.
