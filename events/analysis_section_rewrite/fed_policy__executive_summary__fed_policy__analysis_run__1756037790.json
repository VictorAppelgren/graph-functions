      "feedback": "The draft has substantial depth, but it isn’t yet executive-ready: tighten to 4–6 crisp bullets that deliver one house view, with a single regime framework, explicit catalysts, and testable invalidation points; collapse repetitive sections (medium/long-horizon, near-term, and asset-by-asset narration) into a compact, forward-looking narrative anchored in a causal chain. Specific edits: (1) present a concise house view (base vs. upside vs. downside) with assigned probabilities and one-line implications for risk assets, rather than parallel long explanations; (2) fix the causal chain to: policy expectations and real-rate differentials drive discount rates, which modulate asset prices, cross-asset flows, and regime weights, then map to Tencent/PBOC/energy signals as cross-asset inputs; (3) root the analysis in first principles (real rates, inflation trajectory, energy/external balance) and keep it to testable cross-asset channels (rates, dollar, gold/crypto, AI/tech exposure) with no extraneous diversions; (4) quantify with fixed, sourced deltas and ranges (e.g., near-term Sep rate cut around 50bp with ~150bp of easing embedded over 12 months; ACMR base-case revenue $850–$950m in 2025, margin ~49% gross, 13–14% net, target $34.76 vs $30.53; alt paths and invalidations tied to two-quarter misses); (5) tighten ACMR into a single base-case path plus two explicit alternatives with two invalidations, and attach a 5–6-point watchlist with deltas (Azure revenue trajectory, Shopify GMV growth, IPO cadence, policy/export controls, oil/tariff paths); (6) ensure all critical sources are cited with consistent IDs, reconcile conflicts (e.g., energy oversupply vs inflation persistence, sanctions vs macro easing), and avoid contradictions or attribution errors; (7) trim operational detail, eliminate repeated phrases, and adopt a clean executive tone so the piece reads as a decision-ready brief rather than a literature review.",
