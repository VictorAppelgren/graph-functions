  "content": "Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) were higher in pre-market trading on Friday, buoyed by comments from US president Donald Trump stating that US-based chipmakers could be exempt from sweeping new tariffs, as well as a bullish note from Goldman Sachs (GS) ahead of the company\u2019s upcoming earnings report.\n\n\u201cWe'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,\u201d Trump said during a press conference at the Oval Office. \u201cBut if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you've made a commitment to build or if you're in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff.\u201d\n\nThe remarks were seen as a potential tailwind for companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which has made significant investments in US-based manufacturing and partnerships.\n\nThe rally was further supported by a research note from Goldman Sachs (GS) on Thursday, which raised its price target on Nvidia (NVDA) to $200 from $185, implying an 11% upside from Thursday\u2019s close. The bank maintained a buy rating ahead of Nvidia\u2019s fiscal second-quarter earnings, due on 27 August.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks steady after Bank of England rate cut vote split shock\n\nJames Schneider, a Goldman (GS) analyst, acknowledged that investor expectations were already \u201chigh\u201d, but argued that Nvidia (NVDA) could still deliver a \u201cclean beat-and-raise quarter\u201d. He said the company\u2019s forward guidance, particularly on margins and China exposure, would likely drive market reaction.\n\n\u201cWe expect three focal points on the call,\u201d Schneider wrote, highlighting the upcoming ramp of the Blackwell chip line in the second half of the year and the anticipated launch of Rubin, Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) next-generation architecture scheduled for 2026.\n\nShares in Intel (INTC) were just above the flatline ahead of the US opening bell after Trump took to social media to demand the resignation of CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him \u201chighly conflicted\".\n\nTrump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to criticise Tan, urging immediate action over what he described as a \u201cconflicted\u201d leadership.\n\n\"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns. \"There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\"\n\nThe comments come amid controversy surrounding Tan\u2019s past business dealings, particularly his investments in Chinese tech firms. In response, Tan issued a statement late Thursday, addressing the \u201cmisinformation\u201d circulating about his career.",

How does the AI marketplace stack up against those metrics? Pretty well. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of major publicly traded players and most of the mid-tier players, as well as our industry knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry annual revenue amounted to $250 billion in 2024, and expect that to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when total revenue is forecast to reach $1.8 trillion. The emergence of China's DeepSeek caused a broad selloff in AI stocks earlier this year, a reminder that this space is dynamic. DeepSeek reportedly is inexpensive and powerful. While pricing is important, companies in the AI space prioritize relationships, continuity, security, and reliability. The top priority for companies using AI delivered as-a-service across cloud is to ensure that delivery is secure, low latency (fast), and reliable. Adding new vendors always entails risk that these requirements will not be met. U.S. government policy will likely prevent wide dissemination of Chinese Large Language Models (LLMs) in enterprise technology implementations in the U.S., given risks of \"back doors\" to Chinese military and intelligence. Non-U.S. nations are largely following similar policies. Finally, AI hardware leaders offer GPU software libraries, model training, and inference services tailored to specific enterprise AI applications. The AI market is large and growing, and new entrants are expected to disrupt the market.\nNvidia: Raising Fair Value Estimate to $170 From $140 as Nvidia Is Back in Business in China\nNvidia is a leading developer of graphics processing units. Traditionally, GPUs were used to enhance the experience on computing platforms, most notably in gaming applications on PCs. GPU use cases have since emerged as important semiconductors used in artificial intelligence. Nvidia not only offers AI GPUs, but also a software platform, Cuda, used for AI model development and training. Nvidia is also expanding its data center networking solutions, helping to tie GPUs together to handle complex workloads.\nRatingPrice Target\nTop Analysts: NVDA\nView MoreOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for NVDA overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn MoreDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of NVDA.\nLearn MorePrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of NVDA.\nLearn More"
