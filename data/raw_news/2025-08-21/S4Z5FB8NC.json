  "title": "ProSocial AI Meets Islamic Finance: Values-Driven Tech Revolution",
  "description": "ProSocial AI and Islamic Finance come from different contexts, yet share a commitment to justice and human wellbeing that may reshape how we think about technology in finance.",
  "content": "In an era where artificial intelligence shapes our financial decisions and Islamic finance emerges as a $4 trillion global force, an unexpected alliance is forming. To understand this convergence, it is useful to first clarify terminology: Islamic finance, as defined by Daud Vicary of DVA IFA, represents \"the effective mobilisation of capital in favor of the real economy,\" while encompasses \"AI Systems that are tailored, trained, tested and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet.\" Both domains, though arising from different contexts, share a fundamental commitment to ethical principles, social justice, and human wellbeing that could reshape how we think about technology's role in finance.\n\nAt its core, Islamic finance operates on principles that go far beyond profit maximization. The prohibition of riba (usury), gharar (excessive uncertainty) and mysir (gambling) investments mirrors the principles of prosocial AI, which advocates for AI systems that are centered on human values and motivated by regenerative intent with respect to people and planet.\n\nConsider the Islamic principle of maslaha (public interest ) which is also akin to \"do unto others as you would have done to yourself\" \u2013 which reflects the that has found entry into belief systems around the world. Every financial transaction must contribute to societal wellbeing, not merely generate returns. This alignment with prosocial AI isn't coincidental \u2014 both frameworks recognize that unchecked pursuit of efficiency or profit can lead to societal harm. Whereas a deliberate stance toward shared value is a - for the people we are, the communities we belong to, the countries we are part of and the planet we depend on.\n\nThe concept of \u2014 arising from the complementarity of natural and artificial intelligences \u2014 offers a compelling solution to the apparent tension between traditional Islamic finance and AI innovation. This approach recognizes that while AI excels at processing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns, human intelligence brings contextual understanding, moral reasoning, and cultural sensitivity that remain irreplaceable.\n\nIn Islamic finance, this hybrid model is particularly valuable. Traditional scholars can provide the interpretive framework and ethical oversight, while AI systems handle routine compliance checking, risk assessment, and pattern recognition. For instance, an AI system might identify potentially non-compliant transactions based on predetermined criteria, but human scholars would make the final determination about complex cases requiring contextual judgment.\n\nThis collaboration can amplify the role of Islamic scholarship; it amplifies it. By automating routine tasks, AI frees scholars to focus on more complex interpretive work and strategic guidance. The result is a system that is both more efficient and aligned with Islamic principles. Academic institutions like the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance in Malaysia can play an interesting role in curating this convergence. As Malaysia's global university for Islamic finance, has been at the forefront of researching how emerging technologies can enhance Shariah-compliant financial services while maintaining their ethical foundations.\n\nThe intersection of Islamic finance and prosocial AI isn't merely philosophical. Kuwait Finance House launched demonstrating how AI can serve Islamic banking principles. Meanwhile, research from institutions like INCEIF shows that AI applications offer potential benefits such as automation, improved decision-making, customer recommendations, and enhanced customer experience\u2014all while maintaining Shariah compliance. Apps such as a fully Sharia compliant App that was launched at the last week is one example of the interplay between religious wisdom and high-tech.\n\nThe beauty lies in how deliberately AI-systems that are curated with a prosocial mindset can strengthen Islamic finance's commitment to transparency and fairness. Traditional Islamic finance requires extensive documentation to ensure compliance with Islamic law, but AI can streamline this process while maintaining the ethical oversight that Shariah principles demand. AI-driven algorithms can analyze customer behavior and preferences, allowing financial institutions to offer tailored products while ensuring compliance and security are significantly improved.\n\nBoth systems emphasize risk-sharing over risk-shifting. Islamic finance's prohibition of gharar (excessive uncertainty) aligns perfectly with prosocial AI's emphasis on transparency and explainability. When an AI system makes a credit decision or investment recommendation, the reasoning must be clear and justifiable \u2014 principles that Islamic scholars have upheld for centuries.\n\nThe concept of takaful (mutual guarantee) in Islamic insurance finds its technological cousin in AI systems designed for collective benefit. Both recognize that individual prosperity is meaningless without community wellbeing. The Win-win-win-win logic comes to play once more.\n\nThe marriage isn't without complications. Traditional Islamic finance relies heavily on human scholars for interpretation and oversight, while AI operates through algorithms that can seem like black boxes. One part of the equation lies in designing AI systems that support agency amid AI, and coach the individual ability and volition for critical thinking. judgment. Islamic finance has always required contextual understanding and moral reasoning that pure algorithmic processing cannot provide. Prosocial AI, when properly implemented through hybrid intelligence frameworks, can handle routine compliance checking and pattern recognition while preserving the essential human oversight that Islamic law requires.\n\nCentral to this hybrid approach is the need for double literacy\u2014fluency in both Islamic finance principles and AI capabilities. Financial professionals must understand not only the intricacies of Shariah compliance, risk-sharing mechanisms, and ethical investment criteria, but also how AI algorithms function, their limitations, and their potential for bias. Similarly, AI developers working in Islamic finance must grasp the philosophical foundations of concepts like maslaha (public interest) and the practical implications of gharar (excessive uncertainty) prohibition. This dual competency ensures that technological solutions genuinely serve Islamic finance objectives rather than merely automating conventional practices with an Islamic veneer. Research institutions like INCEIF are pioneering educational programs that cultivate this double literacy, training a new generation of professionals who can navigate both domains with equal expertise.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, both frameworks prove that ethical constraints don't stifle innovation \u2014 they guide it toward more sustainable outcomes. Research institutions are crucial in this process, providing the theoretical foundation for practical implementations that serve multiple stakeholders.\n\nThink of sukuk (Islamic bonds) that use AI to optimize profit-sharing arrangements in real-time, or zakat calculation systems that automatically identify and distribute wealth to those most in need. These innovations emerge from the research-practice loop, where academic institutions develop frameworks that practitioners then implement and refine.\n\nThe convergence of Islamic finance and prosocial AI, supported by solid research institutions and hybrid intelligence models, offers a template for how financial systems can serve humanity's highest aspirations, with respect to the planetary boundaries and future generations. This approach demonstrates that technology can embody moral principles that transcend cultural boundaries. But this vocation starts with human intention. We cannot expect the technology of tomorrow to be better than the humans of today. Garbage in, garbage out versus values in, values out. We have a choice but we must make it.\n\nFor bankers: Start small but think systematically. Implement AI tools that enhance transparency and customer service while maintaining human oversight for complex decisions. Partner with research institutions to ensure your AI implementations are theoretically sound and practically viable. Consider how hybrid intelligence models can strengthen rather than replace human expertise.\n\nFor those with Islamic affinity: Embrace technology as a means of strengthening Islamic values through hybrid intelligence approaches. Demand AI systems that are explainable and aligned with Shariah principles. Support research institutions that are developing frameworks for ethical AI implementation. Remember that the goal isn't technological adoption for its own sake, but leveraging innovation to better serve the ummah (community).\n\nFor researchers and educators: Focus on developing hybrid intelligence that combines the best of natural and artificial intelligence \u2013 and is open to all cultures and religious orientations.. Ensure that research remains connected to practical implementation through partnerships with financial institutions.\n\nThe future of finance lies not in choosing between tradition and innovation, but in wedding them purposefully through research-informed hybrid intelligence. Islamic finance and prosocial AI show us that the most powerful technologies are those guided by timeless human values \u2014 creating systems that don't just work, but work for everyone.",

      "text": "Do you sometimes wish the world was different\u2014more equitable, with abundance of resources so that everyone has a fair chance to thrive? And then you tell yourself to stop dreaming because that\u2019s not how society works, or ever will.\nArtificial intelligence is often portrayed as a double-edged sword\u2014capable of either unlocking unprecedented opportunities or precipitating unforeseen challenges. As we navigate a constantly evolving hybrid landscape, a new paradigm is emerging: prosocial AI. This approach to AI development prioritizes the well-being of individuals, communities, society at large and the planet that all depends on, promoting positive social behaviors, collaboration, and ethical decisionmaking. For businesses, harnessing prosocial AI can not only mitigate risks but also drive sustainable growth, enhance brand reputation, and foster long-term value creation.\nThe Concept of Prosocial AI\nProsocial AI is rooted in the idea that technology should serve the greater good. Unlike traditional AI, which often focuses on optimizing efficiency or maximizing profits, prosocial AI is designed to align with human values and societal goals. It operates on principles of fairness, transparency, and inclusivity, ensuring that its deployment benefits all stakeholders, not just a select few.\nIn practical terms, prosocial AI systems are developed with the explicit intention of fostering positive social outcomes. This could mean anything from reducing biases in hiring algorithms to supporting mental health through AI-driven counseling platforms. The overarching goal is to create AI systems that act as catalysts for positive change, helping to build more equitable, just, and harmonious societies, with careful consideration of the planet.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nPractical Examples of Applied Prosocial AI\nAI in Healthcare: Improving Access and Outcomes\nOne of the most promising applications of prosocial AI is in healthcare, where AI-driven tools are being used to bridge gaps in access and improve patient outcomes. For instance, AI platforms like Ada Health are revolutionizing the way people access healthcare information. By providing personalized medical advice based on user-reported symptoms, Ada Health empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health, especially in underserved areas where access to medical professionals may be limited.\nMoreover, AI is being used to combat mental health challenges, which have become increasingly prevalent in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Platforms like Woebot use AI to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy to users, offering real-time mental health support that is accessible, affordable, and stigma-free. By providing these services, Woebot is making mental healthcare more inclusive and reducing the burden on traditional healthcare systems.\nEthical AI in Recruitment: Promoting Fairness and Diversity\nThe recruitment process is an another area where prosocial AI is making a significant impact. Traditional hiring practices are often plagued by unconscious biases that can perpetuate inequality and limit diversity within organizations. Prosocial AI offers a solution by providing tools that promote fairness and transparency in the hiring process.\nFor example, Pymetrics uses AI to match candidates to roles based on their cognitive and emotional attributes, rather than relying solely on resumes or traditional qualifications. By leveraging neuroscience-based assessments, Pymetrics helps companies identify candidates who are not only qualified but also likely to thrive in a particular role, regardless of their background. This approach not only enhances diversity but also improves job satisfaction and retention rates.\nAI in Education: Enhancing Learning and Inclusion\nYet another arena is education where prosocial AI is driving positive change. AI-driven tools are being used to personalize learning experiences, making education more accessible and inclusive for students with diverse needs. For instance, platforms like Century Tech use AI to tailor educational content to individual learning styles, helping students overcome challenges and achieve their full potential.\nIn addition to personalized learning, prosocial AI is also being used to address the digital divide. Organizations like Onebillion have developed AI-driven educational apps that are designed to work on low-cost devices in resource-constrained environments. By providing high-quality educational content to children in underserved communities, Onebillion is helping to bridge the gap between privileged and underprivileged students, fostering greater equity in education.\nThe Business Case for Prosocial AI: The PRO Framework\nFor businesses, embracing prosocial AI goes beyond just corporate social responsibility\u2014it is a strategic move that can offer substantial benefits. By focusing on PRO\u2014Purpose, Resilience, and Optimization\u2014companies can leverage prosocial AI to drive growth, enhance their reputation, and ensure long-term success.\n1. Purpose-Driven Growth: The foundation of any successful prosocial AI initiative is a clear and compelling purpose. When businesses integrate AI solutions with a strong focus on social good, they align their operations with broader societal goals, creating a purpose-driven organization. This alignment not only appeals to socially conscious consumers but also resonates with employees and stakeholders who increasingly value ethical practices.\n2. Resilience and Risk Mitigation: In today\u2019s volatile business environment, resilience is key to long-term success. Prosocial AI helps companies build resilience by addressing social challenges that could otherwise pose risks to their operations. By promoting fairness and inclusivity, AI-driven tools can mitigate the risk of reputational damage caused by biased hiring practices or discriminatory algorithms.\n3. Optimization for Inclusive Impact: Prosocial AI allows companies to optimize their operations in ways that are both socially responsible and economically beneficial. By designing AI systems that cater to diverse populations, businesses can tap into new markets and expand their reach, ultimately enhancing growth potential while contributing to greater social equity.\nPractical Takeaways for Business Leaders\nTo effectively harness the power of prosocial AI as a business leader you may want to consider the following practical steps:\n1. Start with Purpose: Clearly define the social outcomes you wish to achieve and align your AI strategy with your company\u2019s values and long-term goals.\n2. Prioritize Ethics and Transparency: Ensure that your AI systems are developed and deployed with ethical considerations at the forefront, addressing potential biases and ensuring transparency.\n3. Collaborate for Impact: Work with other businesses, non-profits, and government agencies to amplify the impact of your prosocial AI initiatives.\n4. Measure and Adapt: Continuously measure the impact of your rosocial AI projects and be willing to adapt your approach as needed.\nA PROactive Choice To be Made\nProsocial AI represents a powerful opportunity for businesses to contribute to the greater good while also driving their own success. By aligning AI development with human values and societal goals through the PRO framework, companies can build more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable business models. If AI turns out to be a treasure chest or Pandora\u2019s Box depends on all of us. We can proactively make a choice which way it goes."

      "text": "In recent weeks, the AI landscape reached a new milestone with the release of several reasoning models, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT o3-mini, Deep Seek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Building on the foundations laid by models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, these latest systems demonstrate notable gains in logical consistency and context awareness. Their rapid evolution does not unfold in isolation but coincide with technological strides on multiple fronts.\nA pragmatic response to these converging trends would be an investment in double literacy, an approach that curates and aligns both natural and artificial intelligence as a way of curating hybrid intelligence. Why?\nAn Acceleration Of Our Artificial Arsenal\nAs AI systems grow more capable, jailbreaking \u2014 manipulating AI to bypass its built-in constraints \u2014 has become an increasingly pressing concern. More powerful models often prove more vulnerable to exploitation, challenging developers and policymakers to keep safeguards ahead of potential misuse.\nAt the same time, agentic AI and robotics are making striking advances. Robots researched by NASA robotics and pioneered by Boston Dynamics, among others, illustrate how physical machines equipped with sophisticated sensors and actuators can now navigate, manipulate objects, and execute tasks with unprecedented agility. Meanwhile, purely software-based AI agents \u2014 think advanced virtual assistants or complex problem-solving programs \u2014 leverage machine learning, natural language processing, and large-scale data analysis to make autonomous decisions. They already tackle intricate tasks such as medical diagnostics or financial modeling without needing a physical form.\nIncreasingly, these two fields converge: software agents orchestrate fleets of robots, while robots generate invaluable real-world data to feed AI\u2019s learning processes. Yet, with the rise of powerful AI comes a heightened risk of jailbreaking and related vulnerabilities. The smarter these systems become, the harder they can be to control, underscoring the need for a balanced, human-guided approach that ensures such technologies serve constructive ends.\nGiven these rapid developments, double literacy, mastery of artificial and natural intelligence in complementarity is no longer optional. As (agentic and eventually embodied) AI becomes more deeply intertwined with daily life, individuals, communities, and entire societies must learn to engage with machine intelligence from a position of awareness and agency. But what is natural intelligence?\nNatural Intelligence: A Composition Of 2 x 4 Dimensions\nTo fully grasp the importance of double literacy, we must first define what natural intelligence entails. NI is not simply about cognition; it is a composite of twice four dimensions:\nAspiration, Emotion, Thought, and Sensation are the four core components of individual intelligence. Aspiration shapes long-term goals, emotion influences decision-making, thought structures logic and learning, and sensation grounds perception and experience.\nPerson, Community, Country, and Planet are the four collective dimensions of intelligence. Individuals are not isolated; they are embedded within communities, shaped by national policies, and influenced by global systems. Micro, meso, macro and meta arenas mutually influence each other, and the whole that they are part of. Everything is connected in a continuum of constant change,\nA holistic comprehension of NI means understanding that intelligence is neither purely individual nor solely cognitive. It is an interconnected web of experience shaped by our internal aspirations and emotions and the broader social and planetary context in which we operate. Unlike AI, which excels at processing vast datasets, NI integrates meaning, ethics, and adaptability into decision-making.\nThe Beauty Of Double Literacy\nNI literacy entails appreciating the multidimensional nature of human intelligence \u2014 encompassing aspiration, emotion, thought, and sensation\u2014and recognizing how these individual facets operate within broader social contexts, from person and community to country and planet.\nAI literacy involves understanding how AI models work, including their limitations and inherent biases, as well as the ethical considerations accompanying their use \u2014 such as the potential spread of misinformation and other unintended consequences. It also requires recognizing when to trust AI systems versus relying on human judgment and staying informed about ongoing developments in AI capabilities and regulations.\nA 360-degree understanding of brain and body, self and society, combined with a granular comprehension of technology, improves our critical thinking and moral reasoning ability. It also equips us to take personal responsibility for decisions and outcomes in increasingly hybrid society, in which billions are still left out from the enjoyment of even the most fundamental of their human rights such as education.\nCurating Hybrid Intelligence\nHybrid intelligence merges the best of AI and NI. Machines enhance human capabilities, while humans inject ethical judgment, empathy, and broader contextual understanding into automated processes. This synergy is transforming multiple domains:\nResearch: AI uncovers unconventional connections, but human researchers ensure meaningful interpretation and real-world application.\nMedicine: AI can identify early disease patterns in massive data pools, but doctors integrate empathy, patient histories, and ethical considerations.\nEducation: AI tailors learning paths to individual students while educators inspire creativity, critical thinking, and values-based reasoning.\nBusiness: AI streamlines operations and analyzes market trends, yet leaders provide strategic direction, relationship-building, and ethical guardrails.\nBy blending AI\u2019s precision with NI\u2019s depth, hybrid intelligence positions us to address complex societal challenges responsibly.\nTakeaway: 4 Questions For Daily Double Literacy\nTo strengthen double literacy, individuals and organizations can begin by asking four core questions whenever they interface with AI:\nWhy are you using AI?\nClarify your motivations and ambitions.\nWhat is the AI optimizing for?\nUnderstand the system\u2019s design, objectives, and incentives.\nDoes this align with my values?\nPinpoint where AI complements\u2014or conflicts with\u2014your human priorities.\nWhich decisions will I never delegate to AI?\nMaintain personal agency and moral responsibility in all human-AI collaborations.\nAs AI continues to evolve, merely adapting to new tools is not enough; we must systematically cultivate our own natural intelligence. Because only a deliberate balance of all our assets will ensure we remain informed curators of an ever-expanding universe of machine intelligence, not passive consumers. Agency amid AI is not a luxury but our best bet to flourish.\nSo far, understanding the organically evolving kaleidoscope that each of us represents is not part of traditional school curricula. It is time to change that to future-proof society.\nIn the meantime, each of us, particularly parents, teachers and caregivers, is well advised to start curating hybrid intelligence at home. Without hybrid intelligence, a deliberate balance of AI and NI, we risk designing systems that outpace our ability to guide them."

As we navigate an era of rapid technological advancement, the book offers an ethical framework that urges us to consciously guide AI development in ways that preserve and enhance human dignity.\" (R. S. Chang, Computing Reviews, May 9, 2025)\n\u201cCornelia\u2019s \u2018Human Leadership for Humane Technology' masterfully illustrates what conscious tech leadership is. It\u2019s an essential read for anyone committed to shaping a sustainable future, ensuring technology enhances, rather than detracts from, our humanity.\u201d (Hamilton Mann, Group Vice President \u201cDigital Marketing and Digital Transformation\u201d at Thales, Thinkers50 Radar 2024, Pioneer of \u2018Digital for Good\u2019)\n\u201cCornelia C. Walther\u2019s reflection goes to the heart of the most fundamental question of our times, concerning the nature of our interaction with technology. Chasing our multiple \u201cselves\u201d, in the digital and physical world, we do not spend enough time and attention trying to understand how technology affects us, for better or for worse. Cornelia C. Walther draws attention to the fact that we are not, and should not succumb to the inevitable but think more highly of ourselves and our agency in the world. We may be under pressure, but we retain the right to make societal choices. Technology does not have an agenda of its own, at least at present, which puts the human in the position of influence and responsibility. This is a powerful and thought-provoking book.\u201d (Pawel Swieboda, Founder and Director, NeuroCentury, Co-Founder, Brain Capital Alliance. Practice Lead Neurotechnology, The International Center for Future Generations (ICFG). Senior Visiting Fellow, European Policy Centre. Former director Human Brain Capital Project)\n\u201cAI, discussed and explored by experts for over 60 years, has sprung to the public domain with the splash of generative AI. Cornelia Walther masterfully applies her innovative, multidisciplinary approach (POZE) to tackle some of the thorniest ethical and practical issues about AI creeping in everyday life. She explains how to channel AI to bring out the best of us, fair societies, and a livable planet.\u201d (Enrique Delamonica, Senior adviser, Data and Analytics Team, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF))\n\u201cIn 'Human Leadership for Humane Technology', Cornelia masterfully navigates the interconnectedness of humanity and technology, advocating for an inclusive future where technology serves to amplify our collective human values. This book is a clarion call for leaders and innovators to forge a path where technology not only advances our capabilities but does so with compassion and inclusivity at its core. A compelling read for those dedicated to crafting a technologically advanced yet humane society.\u201d (Elizabeth (Liz) Ngonzi, Founder and CEO, The International Social Impact Institute | Adjunct Assistant Professor, The Center for Global Affairs at New York University)\n\u201cAs an advocate for ethical technology and compassionate leadership, I highly endorse the upcoming book on human leadership for humane technology by Dr. Cornelia Walther. In an era where digital advancements often outpace ethical considerations, this book promises to provide valuable insights and strategies for fostering a more empathetic and responsible approach to technology development. Cornelia's extensive experience brings a unique perspective with a deep understanding of human behavior and ethics. Her insights should empower leaders to navigate the complexity of the digital age with empathy and integrity. This book is a must-read for anyone committed to shaping a more humane future for the tech industry.\u201d (John E. Roche, Senior Managing Director, SAP)\n\u201cThe extent, speed of development and the impact on technological changes humanity are amazing, extraordinary and in many ways shocking and scary. How do we deal with this? How does this modify our individual and collective behavior? How will humanity at large benefit? How can we ensure that technological advances will expand and ensure human rights for all? Cornelia Walther in this impressive book deals with these questions. She discusses and presents alternatives for the present and future journey in face to the new challenges that technological changes present to humanity.\u201d (Alberto Minujin, Executive Director of Equity for Children and Professor The New School)\nAuthors and Affiliations\nAbout the author\nCornelia C.

      "text": "The recently concluded ASEAN AI Malaysia Summit 2025 was more than a conference. It was a deliberate assertion of technological self-determination, designed to resonate beyond Southeast Asia. Sovereignty of artificial intelligence as cultural preservation \u2013 another AI revolution in the making?\nThe Incomplete Triangle Of AI Supremacy\nThe main story people tell about AI has boiled down to a narrow view that treats it mostly as a geopolitical competition: Washington versus Beijing versus Europe, capitalism versus authoritarian control versus consumer orientation. In this dynamic the so-called Global South is often relegated to passive consumption of technologies designed in Western boardrooms, deployed from US-based corporations, trained on English language and culture. This thinking \u2014 amplified by extensive 24/7 hybrid media coverage and heated venture capital echo chambers \u2014 obscures a more nuanced transformation occurring at the periphery of traditional power structures.\nMalaysia is participating in the accelerating AI discourse, and it is beginning to rewrite the terms of engagement.\nWhat emerges from Kuala Lumpur is neither imitation nor opposition, but a coherent alternative \u2013 which challenges the foundational assumptions of AI development itself. This is not about catching up with existing paradigms, but about creating new ones \u2014 a post-colonial reimagining of what artificial intelligence can become if it can be freed from the extractive logic of platform capitalism and rather be guided by a deliberate intent to maximise values and social benefits.\nDigital Sovereignty As Epistemic Independence\nLaunched yesterday Malaysia\u2019s National Cloud Computing Policy is a prime example of this approach. More than mere infrastructure policy, it represents what postcolonial theorists might call epistemic disobedience \u2014 the rejection of technological dependence as natural or inevitable. By mandating data sovereignty and creating indigenous cloud infrastructure, Malaysia is operationalizing technology designed by and for specific cultural contexts, not imposed from above.\nThe projected US$26.18 billion (RM110 billion) in economic impact by 2028 is significant, but the strategic implications are revolutionary: it is proof that economic development need not require digital colonization.\nThe Ilmu Paradigm: Language As Liberation Technology\nThe unveiling of Ilmu on August 12th \u2014 Malaysia's first indigenous multimodal AI model embodies a challenge to AI universalism. Developed through the partnership between YTL AI Labs and Universiti Malaya, Ilmu demonstrates that linguistic diversity is not a market inefficiency to be optimized away, but a source of algorithmic advantage.\nThis matters because language models encode worldviews. When AI systems are trained exclusively on English-dominant datasets, they embed particular ways of understanding reality, hence a coloniality of knowledge weaves past mindsets and values into future algorithms. Ilmu's focus on Bahasa Melayu (Malaysian language) and local dialects is thus both an act of cognitive sovereignty, ensuring that Malaysian AI reflects Malaysian \u201cways of knowing\u201d. At the same time it is a pragmatic path to ensure that Ilmu is configured to give the best possible answers to its proprietary customers: Malaysian individuals and institutions.\nThe collaboration with DeepSeek's open-source LLM amplifies this. By becoming the first nation to deploy open-source LLMs at scale, Malaysia has chosen interoperability over dependency, commons over enclosure. The resulting innovations \u2014 including NurAI, the world's first Shariah-compliant AI chatbot \u2014 demonstrate how technological sovereignty enables cultural specificity rather than constraining it.\nProsocial AI: Economics Of Post-Extractivism\nMalaysia's approach crystallizes the logic of prosocial AI \u2014 AI systems that are tailored, trained, tested, and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet. This is not a pretense of corporate social responsibility nor algorithmic greenwashing, but a deliberate reorientation of technological purpose. Beyond Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d moto, and Sam Altman\u2019s belief that \u201ctechnology happens because it it possible\u201d \u2013 the 4T framework of prosocial AI offers a more maturation and meaningful roadmap to not only navigate, but shape the hybrid future. .\nThe underpinning logic addresses the core challenge of our time: operating within planetary boundaries while meeting human needs. Prosocial AI offers a pathway beyond the false choice between growth and sustainability by recognizing that long-term value creation requires embedding social and environmental considerations into the very architecture of technological systems.\nRather than treating ethical considerations as constraints, Malaysia has begun to find ways to harness them as competitive advantages. Trust becomes a strategic asset, cultural relevance generates market differentiation and environmental consciousness to open new revenue streams. This is capitalism with different parameters \u2014 a form of diverse economies 4.0.\nClimate-Conscious AI: Technology As A Tipping Element\nMalaysia\u2019s emerging AI strategy comes at a painful juncture in planetary history. Scientists have flagged several ecological tipping points \u2013 critical thresholds in the Earth's climate system where a small change can trigger a significant and often irreversible, shift in the system's state. Coming on top and potentially influencing all of them, comes technology as a catalyst that is capable of cascading large-scale transformation for good, or very bad.\nThe urgency cannot be overstated. Current trajectories point toward multiple simultaneous crises: climate breakdown, biodiversity collapse, and social fragmentation. In this context, AI represents both risk and opportunity. Deployed carelessly, AI systems will trigger an ABCD of AI-issues - degrading human agency, fragilizing interpersonal bonds, amplifying resource consumption and accelerating social stratification. Deployed consciously, they offer the opportunity to empower humans as agents of change, optimize resource flows, accelerate renewable energy transitions and help coordinate collective action at previously impossible scales.\nMalaysia's take on developing an AI framework suggests that technology could become a positive element in the planetary health equation \u2013 if regenerative intent were to be embedded into its algorithmic architecture. Future AI systems could be designed not merely to minimize environmental harm, but to actively contribute to ecological restoration.\nBecause a climate-conscious AI approach not only acknowledges that technological transition must occur but acts on it. It's a smart choice.\nAs climate breakdown accelerates and social inequality deepens, the question is not whether AI will reshape society, but whether that reshaping will kill or cultivate human flourishing within planetary boundaries. A true AI revolution is not about more powered technology, but the regenerative human intent that drives it."

  "argos_summary": "The article explores how Islamic finance\u2019s ethical principles\u2014such as prohibition of riba, gharar, and emphasis on maslaha\u2014align with prosocial AI\u2019s focus on fairness, transparency, and societal benefit, proposing a hybrid intelligence model that combines human scholarly oversight with AI\u2019s data\u2011processing power. It highlights practical examples from Kuwait Finance House, Malaysia\u2019s AI initiatives (Ilmu, NurAI), and academic institutions like INCEIF and IEEI that are developing Shariah\u2011compliant AI tools for compliance, risk assessment, and customer service. The piece argues for double literacy in both natural and artificial intelligence, urging financial professionals and technologists to cultivate a shared understanding of ethical frameworks to ensure AI systems serve human and planetary wellbeing. It concludes that technology, when guided by regenerative intent and cultural sovereignty, can become a catalyst for sustainable growth rather than a source of harm.",
