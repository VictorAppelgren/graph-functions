      "text": "'We lost two angels': Families remember children slain, wounded in Minnesota shooting\nFamilies describing \"unimaginable loss\" recalled their slain children Aug. 28, the day after an attacker fired through the windows of a Minneapolis Catholic school church and sent worshipers diving behind pews for cover.\nJesse Merkel, the father of Fletcher Merkel, 8, called the suspected shooter a \"coward\" who took his son\u2019s life.\n\"Please remember Fletcher for the person he was and not the act that ended his life,\" Jesse Merkel said. \"Give your kids an extra hug and kiss today. We love you, Fletcher. You'll always be with us.\"\nThe deadly shooting occurred at Annunciation Catholic School, a private elementary school in Minneapolis with about 395 students, just before 8:30 a.m. local time on Aug. 27, authorities said. According to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, the shooter approached the outside of the church building and fired inside toward the children sitting in pews.\nThe two children killed in the shooting were 8 and 10 years old. Eighteen other people, 15 of them students ages 6 to 18 and three parishioners in their 80s, were struck by gunfire, authorities said. All the injured were expected to recover, though family members of some say they will have long roads to recovery from serious bullet wounds.\nAuthorities have not publicly released the names of the victims shot in the attack, but families and friends have begun to identify their loved ones.\n\"We as a community have a responsibility to make sure that no child, no parent, no teacher ever has to experience what we\u2019ve experienced today ever again,\" Annunciation School Principal Matt DeBoer said in a news conference on Aug. 27. \"We lost two angels today. Please continue to pray for those still receiving care. Never again can we let this happen.\"\nFletcher Merkel\nSpeaking at a news conference outside the Annunciation Catholic School, Jesse Merkel recalled his son Fletcher as a very loving child who enjoyed friends, fishing, cooking, and \"any sport that he was allowed to play.\"\nThe killer's violent actions have brought tremendous loss to Fletcher's family, Jesse Merkel said. \"We will never be allowed to hold him, talk to him, play with him, and watch him grow into the wonderful young man he was on the path to becoming,\" he added.\nFletcher was the second youngest of four children, family spokesperson Blois Olson told NBC News. He and two of his siblings, who were not injured in the shooting, were attending Mass together on Aug. 27, according to NBC News and ABC11.\n\"While the hole in our hearts and lives will never be filled, I hope that in time our family can find healing,\" Jesse Merkel added. He also shared prayers of healing, recovery, and strength for the other victims and their families.\n\u201cOver the past day, I\u2019ve heard many stories accounting the swift and heroic actions of children and adults alike, from inside the church. Without these people and their selfless actions, this could have been a tragedy of many magnitudes more. For these people, I am thankful,\u201d he said.\nIn his closing remarks, Jesse Merkel asked the public for empathy as his family and school community grieve and \"try to make sense of such a senseless act of violence.\"\nHarper Moyski\nThe second victim killed in the shooting was identified as 10-year-old Harper Moyski, according to a joint statement shared to news outlets on her family's behalf.\n\"We are devastated to share that our beloved daughter, Harper Moyski, was tragically killed in the recent school shooting,\" reads the statement from Michael Moyski and Jackie Flavin, according to CBS News and KSTP-TV. \"Harper was a bright, joyful, and deeply loved 10-year-old whose laughter, kindness, and spirit touched everyone who knew her.\"\nHarper's family said their hearts were broken \"not only as parents, but also for Harper's sister, who adored her big sister and is grieving an unimaginable loss.\" They added that they were grieving for those who were in mourning and for those wounded in the attack.\nThe family noted that while they were focusing on their daughter and healing, they believe \"it is important that her memory fuels action.\"\n\"No family should ever have to endure this kind of pain. We urge our leaders and communities to take meaningful steps to address gun violence and the mental health crisis in this country,\" the statement reads. \"Change is possible, and it is necessary\u2014so that Harper's story does not become yet another in a long line of tragedies.\"\n\"We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love, prayers, and support,\" the statement continued. \"Harper's light will always shine through us, and we hope her memory inspires others to work toward a safer, more compassionate world.\"\nSophia Forchas\nSophia Forchas was injured in the shooting and remained in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery, according to a GoFundMe organized for the family. The 12-year-old was described as a \"bright, kind, and full of life young girl who is now fighting for her life.\"\n\"Her road ahead will be long, uncertain, and incredibly difficult \u2014 but she is strong, and she is not alone,\" the GoFundMe page states.\nSophia's younger brother was also at the school during the shooting, but he was unharmed, according to the page. Their mother, a pediatric critical care nurse at Hennepin County Medical Center, had arrived to work on Aug. 27 to help with wounded victims \"before knowing it was her children's school that was attacked, and that her daughter was critically injured,\" the page states.\nFather Timothy Sas of St. Mary's Greek Orthodox Church in Minneapolis also released a statement confirming that Sophia was injured in the shooting. Sas said the Forchas family, along with several students from Annunciation Catholic School, are parishioners at the church.\n\"Among the 20 shooting victims, was also our wonderful Sophia Forchas, (a) 12-year-old 7th grader,\" Sas said in the statement. \"Sophia was born and raised in our St. Mary\u2019s parish, immersed in the life of the Church together with her extended family of several generations who are devoted members of our congregation.\"\nEndre Gunter\nEndre Gunter was shot twice while attending Mass at Annunciation Catholic Church, according to his aunt, Natalie Davis, who organized a GoFundMe page to help with the 13-year-old's medical bills.\n\"It's impossible to make sense of this act of violence against children, in a place that should have been a sanctuary of peace and safety,\" Davis wrote on the page. \"In the face of unimaginable fear and pain, Endre showed strength and faith beyond his years.\"\nBefore Endre was taken into surgery, Davis said he asked the doctor to pray with him. The doctor later told his family that Endre survived the surgery and \"fought through a terrifying event with courage that inspired the entire medical team,\" according to Davis.\n\"That moment of prayer, and Endre's resilience, will stay with our family forever,\" his aunt said. \"Right now, he is recovering from surgery at the hospital, surrounded by his loved ones and the best medical team possible. While the road ahead is long, we are beyond grateful he is still with us.\"\nDavid Haeg\nDavid Haeg, a young student at the Annunciation Catholic School, was \"tragically injured\" during the Aug. 27 shooting, according to a GoFundMe organized on behalf of his family.\n\"Our school community is heartbroken as we rally around one of our own, David Haeg,\" the page states. \"His road to recovery will be long, but he is showing incredible strength and resilience.\"\nThe fundraiser will help with the cost of David's medical expenses, \"so his parents can focus fully on being by his side and helping him heal.\" He is expected to remain in the pediatric intensive care unit for at least five days after undergoing surgery, according to the GoFundMe page.\nThe organizer of the fundraiser has asked the public and the community to pray for David and his family.\nContributing: Charles Ventura, USA TODAY"

      "text": "'Absolutely breaks my heart': Minneapolis community mourns after deadly shooting: Updates\nEditor's note: This page summarizes news on the Minneapolis school shooting for Wednesday, Aug. 27. For the latest updates on the shooting at Annunciation Church, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Thursday, Aug. 28.\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2212 Two children were killed Wednesday and at least 17 people were injured when a shooter fired through the windows of a Minneapolis Catholic Church toward young students worshipping at Mass, authorities said.\nThe shooting occurred at Annunciation Church, which also houses a school, just before 8:30 a.m., authorities said. The shooter approached the outside of the church building and fired inside toward the children sitting in pews, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.\nThe two children killed were ages 8 and 10. Fourteen of the 17 injured were children, and two of them are in critical condition, O'Hara said.\nThe assailant died at the rear of the church from a self-inflicted wound, according to O'Hara, who said the weapons used in the attack had been purchased legally and recently.\nAuthorities at an afternoon news conference identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23. FBI Director Kash Patel said the attack is being investigated as \"an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics.''\nThe Mass was in celebration of the first week of school, authorities confirmed. \"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,\" O'Hara said.\nDevelopments:\n\u220e In addition to the 14 injured children, three parishioners in their 80s were wounded in the shooting, O'Hara said.\n\u220e The school posted a message on Facebook sharing its grief and expressing gratitude to its \"heroic staff'' and law enforcement for their efforts to protect the students after the attack began.\n\u220e The shooting came after at least three other fatal shootings in the city in the last 24 hours that do not appear to be related to the Annunciation incident, O'Hara said.\n'Absolutely breaks my heart': Community gathers at vigil for victims\nTears dripped down Rosemary Andrade\u2019s cheeks as she picked up a marker and wrote a message on a cross. The cross is a memorial for the eight-year-old child who died in the shooting. Another cross for the 10-year-old child who died sat next to it.\nAndrade, 17, remembers sitting in the pews of Annunciation Church herself. She told the USA TODAY Network on Wednesday that she was a student there for nine years. She said the shooting hit home.\n\u201cKnowing I could have been in those benches, that I was once in those benches at that church, praying to God,\u201d Andrade said. \u201cKnowing what happened to those kids, who didn't deserve that, absolutely breaks my heart.\u201d\nAndrade is among the many Minnesotans who attended a prayer vigil for the two children. Attendees sat in folding plastic chairs, on bleachers, and stood along the sides to hear Archbishop Bernard Hebda speak in the Academy of Holy Angels High School gymnasium that night.\n\u201cI'm not usually that emotional, but I was genuinely shaking,\u201d said Elaina Polding, 17, who goes to youth group at Annunciation Church.\nHebda spoke with the USA TODAY Network after the vigil. As the FBI investigates the attack as \"an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics,\" he stressed the importance of holding onto faith.\n\"We really have no other choice than to stick to our faith,\" he said. \"That's who we are, and we hope that we're always going to be a community of love that welcomes, but we have to be faithful to who we are.\"\nFirst lady calls for 'pre-emptive intervention' to identify potential shooters\nIn a rare statement on X, first lady Melania Trump called for \"pre-emptive intervention\" to identify \"potential school shooters.\"\n\"Early warning signs are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions,\" Melania Trump wrote, adding that being aware of those signs and \"acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.\"\n\"To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society\u2014beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms,\" she said.\nThe first lady also called the shooting a \u201csenseless and depraved violent act,\u201d and shared her condolences for the victims' families and friends.\n\"There is nothing that anyone can say to make your grief go away, but please know that you are not alone. My thoughts, love, and deepest sympathy are with you during this dreadful time,\" she added.\nChildren as young as 6 injured\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Center said it received 10 of the most seriously injured victims. Earlier, the hospital reported that it had 11 patients.\nMost of the patients were children who ranged in age from 6 to 14, according to Dr. Thomas Wyatt, chair of emergency medicine. Four of the patients required surgery, he said, adding that the area children's hospitals treated some of the other, less critical pediatric patients.\nIn a later update, the hospital said one adult and five children remained in critical condition. Three other children and another adult were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\nSocial media statement taken down\nAt an afternoon news conference, O'Hara referenced online messages from the shooter released Wednesday that were timed to publish during the attack. He said the FBI ordered the YouTube clips to be taken down and was reviewing them.\n\"This manifesto appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings,\" said O'Hara, adding that police have not ascertained a motive.\nAsked whether the assailant had attended Annunciation school, O'Hara said investigators haven't confirmed that but are looking into it. According to public records cited by Reuters, Westman's mother, Mary Westman, had been an administrative assistant at Annunciation Church.\nArchived versions of the videos from the now-deleted YouTube page show the shooter displaying a handwritten journal and an arsenal of firearms and ammunition. The footage, posted hours before the shooting, alluded to a handwritten note that includes the name Robin Westman. The videos included a handwritten map of the interior of Annunciation Church. The note references severe depression and suicidal thoughts.\nThe shooter\u2019s firearms were marked with a variety of political slogans in silver marker in both English and Russian. O'Hara said police were processing four search warrants seeking the shooter's motive and had seized other firearms.\nShooter had messages on rifle magazine, DHS chief says\nIn a post on social media, Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the shooter had the words, \"\u2018For the Children\u2019 and \u2018Where is your God?\u2019 and \u2018Kill Donald Trump\u2019 on a rifle magazine.\"\n\"This level of violence is unthinkable,'' she wrote. \"Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere.\"\nLongtime neighbor vouches for Westman family as 'great people'\nThe Westman family home is about half a mile southwest of Annunciation Catholic School. Terry Cole has lived in that same Windom neighborhood for more than 20 years.\u201cWe walk around the neighborhood and we can tell you who lives in every house,\u201d Cole said, expressing surprise a member of the Westman family would be involved in such a brutal attack. \u201cThey\u2019re great people,\u201d Cole said.As Cole and the neighborhood move forward, the impacted families are top of mind. \u201cIt just feels so bad for both of (the victims) and for the families,\u201d Cole said.\nPope Leo sends his condolences to the Twin Cities\nPope Leo XIV sent his \u201cheartfelt condolences\u201d to church leadership in the Twin Cities, according to Archbishop Bernard Hebda of Minneapolis and St. Paul.\nHebda said he received a telegram in which the first American leader of the Catholic Church also expressed \"the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the loss of a child.\"\nThe Pontiff commends \"the souls of the deceased children to the love of Almighty God\" and \"prays for the wounded as well as the first responders, medical personnel and clergy who are caring for them and their loved ones,\u201d according to the telegram.\nPope Leo imparted his Apostolic blessing on those impacted by the tragedy as a \"pledge of peace, fortitude, and consolation in the Lord Jesus.\u201d\n\u2212 Amanda Myers\nShooter fired from outside the church\nThe shooter, who was not immediately identified, fired through church windows from the outside of the building. The attacker may have also gone inside the church, but investigators haven't determined whether the person also fired from inside the building.\nThe number of rounds fired was \"in the dozens,\" O'Hara said. The shooter is believed to have used three firearms: a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol.\n\"Children are dead,\" Mayor Jacob Frey said. \"Those families are suffering immense pain right now. Think of this as if it were your own. Every one of us needs to be wrapping our arms around these families, giving them every ounce that we can muster.\"\nLocal business went into lockdown, says shooting hits close to home\nHours after Kowalski\u2019s Markets in south Minneapolis opened for the day, Johna Green was standing outside the store when she heard gunshots ring out down the block at Annunciation Catholic School.\n\u201cIt was very rapid fire, probably like 20 to 30 shots total,\u201d Green told USA TODAY, adding that she hustled her customers inside and the store went on lockdown.\nGreen said the shooting has hit close to home, particularly because store employees recently lost a loved one to gun violence and have a close relationship with the school. \u201cThose kids come in here every day and get our donuts, we do donations to the school all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis really hits hard for us.\u201d\nBen Olson, who works down the street at Fixt Rite Auto Repair & Tire Center, said he noticed a handful of squad cars on his way into work, and by 9 a.m. a heavy law enforcement presence had engulfed the area. From his position about a block southwest of the school, he could see crowds of students and parents leaving and hear a helicopter circling overhead.\n\u201cWe're very concerned. A lot of us here are parents and have young children that are either just about to enter school or are already in school,\u201d Olson said. \u201cAnd us being kind of a staple in the community here, it\u2019s very concerning because we\u2019re very close with a lot of the neighborhood residents here and have been for quite some time.\u201d\n\u2212N'dea Yancey-Bragg\nGovernor decries 'horrific act of violence'\n\"I\u2019m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,\" Minnesota Gov. Walz said.\n\"There is no active threat to the community at this time,\" the Minneapolis Police Department said in an update earlier Wednesday.\n\"A man dressed in all black and armed with a rifle was reported at the scene,\" neighboring Richfield Police said in a social media post.\nStudents were in their first week of school\nStudents at Annunciation Catholic School were in their first week back from summer break, according to Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith.\n\"These kids should not be fearing for their lives,\" Smith said.\nThe Annunciation Catholic School has students from preschool through eighth grade, according to its website.\nParents rush to the site of the shooting\nParents were seen rushing to the school amid the chaos. Both parents and students trickled down West Diamond Lake Road as law enforcement officers blocked the street roughly half a mile from the church.\nMany law enforcement agencies were on the scene, including the Minneapolis Police Department, State Patrol and the FBI.\nNeighbor recalls hearing gunshots\nResident David Gartner texted his neighbor when he first heard what seemed like roughly four spurts of gunfire. \u201cIt sounded like a nail gun at first,\u201d Gartner said.\nThe street was initially calm, and he said the only sign a shooting took place was moments later when police arrived.\nGartner has lived near the border of Minneapolis\u2019 Windom and Tangletown neighborhoods for more than 25 years. He said nothing like this has happened in the immediate area before.\nNow he and his neighbors are outside waiting to learn more. \u201cThe neighbors are all out checking on each other,\u201d he said.\nInterfaith chaplain to parents: 'God is always with you'\nInterfaith Chaplain Howard Dotson met with parents and students at the reunification point. Dotson said he arrived at the school around 9:15 a.m. and saw students coloring pictures of hearts.\n\"I told the children and parents, \u2018God\u2019s hedge of protection is around you. God protects your heart and mind. God is always with you,'\" Dotson said.\nThe chaplain said his favorite interaction was with the music teacher, who he said told him students sang songs like \u201cLord Prepare Me to be a Sanctuary.\u201d Dotson said music and art can help students cope with the shooting. He would like Minneapolis to bolster its use of chaplains in crisis response.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough chaplains,\u201d Dotson said. \u201cWe need more chaplains, psychological first aid, because these traumatic incidents keep happening, and people need that emotional, spiritual support immediately.\u201d\nFlags at half-staff to honor shooting victims\nPresident Donald Trump ordered all flags on government property to be flown at half-staff as \u201ca mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated,\u201d the White House said on X.\nThe proclamation, which orders flags to be lowered at public buildings, on naval ships and at military posts nationwide and abroad, will be in effect until sunset on Sunday.\n\u2212 Christopher Cann\nReligious leaders express shock and sadness\nLocal religious leaders were quick to condemn the bloodshed.\n\"Our hearts are shattered by the horrific act of violence that occurred at Annunciation Catholic Church and School in Minneapolis,\" Patrick M. Neary, the bishop of The Diocese of Saint Cloud, said in a statement.\nHe added: \"As Catholics, we believe in the dignity of every human life. That dignity is destroyed when violence becomes routine.\"\nThe Sisters of the Order of Saint Benedict reacted to the shooting in a Facebook post.\n\"Our hearts grieve with Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis and with the two families who have lost a child,\" it said. \"These acts of violence are horrific, senseless and far too frequent. Lord, have mercy on our world, and be with the students, families, staff and community in this tragic time.\"\n\u2212 Teagan King\nAnnunciation Church rampage is the latest mass shooting in the US\nThe deadly shooting at Annunciation Church was the 286th mass shooting in the United States, and the latest to rock the city of Minneapolis, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive.\nThe organization defines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four people are struck by gunfire, not including the shooter. This year, mass shootings have broken out in 43 states and Washington, D.C., the nonprofit says.\nMinneapolis has experienced at least six mass shootings this year, data shows, including an incident on Tuesday in which a gunman opened fire on a group of people standing on a sidewalk across the street from a high school, killing one person and injuring six others.\n\u2212 Christopher Cann\nShooting erupts after at least 3 others in the past 24 hours\nThe school attack followed within 24 hours at least three other fatal gunfire incidents in Minneapolis, including a mass shooting on Tuesday afternoon in which one person died and six were injured when a gunman opened fire in broad daylight at people standing on a sidewalk.\nTwo other people were killed in two other shootings in the last day, according to the Minneapolis Police Department. Police said it was unclear whether the first three shootings were related.\n\"The level of gun violence across the city within the last day is deeply unsettling,\" O'Hara said in a statement after the third reported shooting early Wednesday."
