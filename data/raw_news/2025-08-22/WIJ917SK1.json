Overall focus on elevating and aligning studio management on key metrics including peak day staffing, premium services and indirect labor management helped to drive these results.\n\nDrive growth through operating partners and franchise partners \u2013 positive momentum of Company's fleet revenue base came in part from new and existing operating partners.

Additionally, with an employee\u2019s growing tenure with the Company, there are more opportunities for career path advancement, equity ownership, and artistic self-expression.\n\nBoston, MA, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MiniLuxe Holding Corp. (TSXV: MNLX) today announced its financial results for the 13 and 26 weeks ended June 29, 2025 (\"Q2 2025\" and \u201cH1 2025\u201d). The fiscal year of MiniLuxe (\u201cThe Company\u201d) is a 52-week reporting cycle ending on Sunday closest to December 31, which periodically necessitates a fiscal year of 53 weeks; fiscal years referred to in this release consist of 52-week periods. Unless otherwise specified, all amounts are reported in U.S. dollars.\n\nMiniLuxe continued its momentum with year-over-year growth. Q2 2025 system-wide sales delivered $7.7M versus prior year of $6.9M, translating into a year-over-year increase of 12%. Total H1 2025 system sales grew to $14M from $12.6M, an 11% year-over-year increase. On a company basis Q2 2025 net revenue increased 8% to $7.5M compared to Q2 2024 revenue of $6.9M. H1 2025 revenue was $13.6M representing 8% growth over H1 2024. This revenue growth was driven by continuous focus on levers to enhance the unit economics of the Company\u2019s underlying fleet of studios and the overall strength on studio leaders and operating partners that it is attracting. In Q2, the median average unit volume for MiniLuxe\u2019s top quartile studios exceeded $1.8M per unit store and for the trailing four quarters, cash contribution was up nearly 20% across the fleet.\n\nThe second quarter of 2025 also delivered positively across all key metrics of profitability. For Q2 2025 there was ~$3.2M in gross profit, representing a 5% increase from $3M in Q2 2024. H1 2025 delivered total gross profit of $5.7M, or an 8% increase over H1 2024 of $5.3M. Gross profit margin contracted slightly in Q2 2025 versus prior year by 1 percentage point, as a result of intentional investments to recruit and develop nail designers which ultimately added staffing hours. These additional staffing hours were critical towards realizing the demand across peak weekends and holidays such as Easter, Mother\u2019s Day and the Fourth of July.\n\nAs a proxy for the health of the operating cash flows, the Company focuses on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) growth. Management also sees its adjusted EBITDA as a key success indicator towards long-term profitability. In Q2 2025, the Company\u2019s operating loss was ($1.2M) a $0.3M improvement over Q2 2024, primarily driven by higher revenue. For H1 2025, the Company\u2019s operating loss was ($3.2M), a $0.1M improvement over H1 2024.\n\nTaking out non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA for total company (inclusive of all overhead) came in for Q2 2025 at ~($.8M) while Fleet 4-wall adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled from prior year\u2019s performance at $1.4M from $.8M.\n\nThe core studio base continues to drive attractive and growing unit economics with a consistent and resilient multi-year trend of growth. In Q2 2025, service revenue from the fleet increased by $0.6M to $7.4M, or 9% over Q2 2024. MiniLuxe saw strong trends on the demand and supply side of its business: (a) positive momentum on the demand side (new client and loyal client growth) and (b) growth and development of supply side (talent ecosystem growth). The Company maintained its high level of talent engagement and held a YoY retention rate of 87% at the end of the second quarter.\n\n\"Our positive and strong second quarter results represent the execution focus of the leadership and field team alongside our incredible and growing team of operating partners and field associates on delivering an exceptional and consistent client experience.\u201d said Tony Tjan, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of MiniLuxe.\n\nAnd he continues, \"We are, of course, proud to have another record quarter in which we estimate our growth to be 2x industry growth for retail sales and are grateful for the loyalty of our clients and team.\u201d\n\nThe following table outlines the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024:\n\nThe following table presents cash and cash equivalents as of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024:\n\nThis press release references certain non-IFRS measures used by management. These measures are not recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release are \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"Fleet Adjusted EBITDA.\"\n\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA most accurately reflects the commercial and operational reality of the Company's operations on an ongoing basis by adding back non-cash expenses. Additionally, the rent-related adjustments ensure that studio-related expenses align with revenue generated over the corresponding time periods.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back fixed asset depreciation, right-of-use asset amortization under IFRS 16, asset disposal, and share-based compensation expense to IFRS operating income, then deducting straight-line rent expenses net of lease abatements. IFRS operating income is revenue less cost of sales (gross profit), additionally adjusted for general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense.\n\nThe Company also uses Fleet Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its MiniLuxe Core Studio business. This metric is calculated in a similar manner, starting with Talent revenue and adjusting for non-fleet Talent revenue and cost of sales, further adjusted by fleet general and administrative expenses and finally subtracting straight line rent expense. The Company believes that this metric most closely mirrors how management views the fleet portion of the business.\n\nThe following table reconciles total company Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table reconciles Fleet Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the periods indicated:\n\n, a Delaware corporation based in Boston, Massachusetts.
