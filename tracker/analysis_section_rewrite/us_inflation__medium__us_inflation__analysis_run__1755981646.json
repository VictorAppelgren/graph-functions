      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but still feels like a high‑level narrative rather than a rigorous, data‑driven scenario. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly mapping each macro driver to a concrete market outcome (e.g., “UAS job growth → higher wage bill → 0.5‑0.7 % earnings lift for defense firms → 1‑2 % dividend hike for dividend kings”). Replace vague “technological breakthroughs” with specific milestones (e.g., FAA’s Part 107 rule changes, 2024 defense budget increases) and quantify the UAS job jump (97 % from 712 to 1,400 jobs, average salary $105,912) with a source tag (FOM34PUWA). For the BOJ, cite the exact wage‑growth figures or policy stance (A7VLN74BK) and link them to U.S. corporate earnings via a wage‑price spiral model. The small‑cap thesis needs hard numbers: Russell 2000’s P/E 12.3 vs S&P 500’s 18.7, 30 % of RUT firms negative earnings, 95 IPOs in 2025 raising $12.9 bn (Q7VVGNSQE). For dividends, list current yields and payout ratios (Abbott 1.8 %, AbbVie 3.2 %, Pfizer 6.7 %, payout ratios 60‑70 %) and tie them to projected earnings growth (WISLWAJ15). Drop generic “tight labor market” language; instead, model a 0.3 % wage rise per quarter and its impact on consumer spending. For Inghams, quantify the 60 % sales concentration and the 5‑customer dependency, and note the lack of pricing power (GUJQZY4UO). Finally, structure the scenario map with clear trigger windows (e.g., Q4 2025 defense budget release, Q1 2026 BOJ policy meeting) and explicit invalidation points (e.g., a 5 % drop in UAS orders, a 2 % contraction in Japanese GDP). Add citation IDs after each numeric claim and ensure every source is referenced. This will elevate the analysis from a descriptive overview to a precise, actionable investment playbook.",
