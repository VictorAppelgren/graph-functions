  "content": "Payments company Wise is reportedly weighing becoming a full-fledged bank in the United Kingdom.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nThe company has been in touch with experienced financial services executives in the last two months about roles in a future banking business, British newspaper The Times reported Monday (Sept. 1). The plans are in the early stages, as Wise has not yet applied for a banking license.\n\nA spokesperson for Wise told PYMNTS the company does not comment on \u201crumors or speculation.\u201d\n\nWise, originally called TransferWise, was launched in 2011 as a money transfer company. It rebranded to Wise in February 2021 to reflect that its services had branched out into other areas, including bank-like services such as debit cards and multi-currency accounts.\n\nHowever, Wise is not a licensed deposit taker and operates under electronic money rules, meaning customer funds can\u2019t be used for lending and must be ring-fenced, the report said.\n\nJohn Cronin, a banking analyst at SeaPoint Insights, said it is \u201centirely plausible\u201d that Wise would try to become a fully-fledged bank, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThey could potentially look to convert the funds they safeguard into deposits, which they could then recycle into lending opportunities,\u201d he said, per the report. \u201cA banking license would give them direct access to the U.K.\u2019s payment infrastructure, enabling them to reduce their reliance on third-party banks for clearing and settlement, potentially reducing costs and operational complexity.\u201d\n\nWise applied in June to become a national trust bank in the United States. The move would allow it to bypass intermediary banks and settle dollar payments directly with the Federal Reserve, potentially reducing costs and leading to faster transfers, the report said.\n\nAlso in June, the company said it planned to move its primary listing to a stock exchange in the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).\n\nThe proposed dual listing would bring \u201csubstantial strategic and capital market benefits\u201d to the company and its owners, Wise co-founder and CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann said at the time.\n\n\u201cThese include helping us drive greater awareness of Wise in the U.S., the biggest market opportunity in the world for our products today, and enabling better access to the world\u2019s deepest and most liquid capital market,\u201d K\u00e4\u00e4rmann said. \u201cA dual listing would also enable us to continue serving our U.K.-based owners effectively, as part of our ongoing commitment to the U.K.\u201d",

It rebranded to Wise in February 2021 to reflect that its services had expanded to include cross-border payments, enacting a network and working to make international banking easier.\nIt was reported in May 2024 that the City of London, the administrator of the financial district of the U.K., was grappling with concerns about the district\u2019s competitiveness and the need for foreign investment.\nThe financial sector has faced challenges since the U.K. left the European Union and has seen U.K. companies consider listing in New York instead."

That community now even includes the banks themselves,\u201d Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann, CEO and co-founder, said, according to the release. \u201cWe\u2019ve evolved to fix more than just money transfer, but the core experience of using Wise will remain faster, cheaper, and more convenient than anything else. Our mission remains the same. We\u2019re still making \u2014 and always will be making \u2014 money work without borders.\u201d\nNicholas Lembo, head of America growth for Wise, said the legacy approaches used by many banks have held back cross-border pay from being as efficient as possible. Instead, the process involves correspondent banks sending money from one to the next before reaching their final destinations, with added costs because of the banks\u2019 fees."
