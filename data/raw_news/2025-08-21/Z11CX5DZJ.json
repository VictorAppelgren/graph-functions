  "description": "Hollow Knight fans found strange ways to cope with impatience and anticipation.",
  "content": "Hollow Knight: Silksong will be released on September 4. It will come out simultaneously on Windows, macOS, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch, and the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nOn paper, \"game gets release date\" isn't particularly groundbreaking news, and the six-year wait between the game's announcement and release is long but nowhere near record-breaking. People have waited longer for Metroid Prime 4 (announced 2017, releasing this fall), Duke Nukem Forever (announced 1997, released 2011), the fourth BioShock game (in development for a decade at a studio that just got ravaged by layoffs), and Half-Life 3 (never actually announced, but hope springs eternal), just to name a few.\n\nBut fans of 2017's Hollow Knight managed to make the wait for Silksong into a meme. It's hard to explain why if you haven't already been following along, but it's probably got something to do with the expected scale of the game, the original Hollow Knight's popularity, and the almost total silence of the small staff at Team Cherry, the game's developer.\n\nWhy does this game make people act this way?\n\nSilksong began development as downloadable content for Hollow Knight, a gloomy Metroidvania about a silent, unnamed protagonist battling their way through the fallen insect kingdom of Hallownest. Funded via Kickstarter, Hollow Knight became a huge hit thanks to its distinctive 2D art style, atmospheric soundtrack, sharp and satisfying gameplay, memorable boss fights, and worldbuilding that gave players just enough information to encourage endless speculation about Hallownest's rise and fall.\n\nThe expansion, first mentioned all the way back in 2014, would focus on Hornet, a mantis who fought battles with a needle and thread. She had been an NPC in the main game but would become a fully playable character in the DLC.\n\nBy February of 2019, Team Cherry announced that the Hornet DLC had become \"too large and too unique to stay a DLC\" and would instead be \"a full-scale sequel to Hollow Knight.\"",

      "text": "Early 2025 saw a bevy of newfound speculation over signs that the long, long wait for Half-Life 3 might soon be over. Now, data contained in some new Valve game updates suggests that the project, known in Valve engine code as \"HLX\"\u2014and widely assumed to be Half-Life 3\u2014might be reaching the final stages of production.\nIn a new video, longtime Valve watcher Tyler McVicker goes into detail on a bevy of new variables and strings found after spending hours data-mining the latest update to Dota 2 (the first update for that game since mid-December). The strings suggest a wave of behind-the-scenes Source engine changes dealing with the kind of \"optimization and polish\" that \"happen[s] at the end of a game's production cycle,\" McVicker says. \"This is getting to the point where it does feel as if Valve is nearing completion of the production of HLX.\"\nThose changes include a set of new code in a file called AI_baseNPC.fgd, which is not actively used by Dota 2 and includes many circumstantial Half-Life references (e.g. \"machinery,\" \"alien blood\"). The specific code in this latest update deals with letting the engine scale the level of an NPC's AI simulation based on its distance from the player, a refinement that McVicker says is \"absolutely... optimization work\" and an apparent sign that \"Valve has hit the optimization and polish phase\" on HLX.\nMcVicker also makes note of a February 25 update to Deadlock which includes a new variable suggestively named \"hlx_fsr3_min_reactiveness.\" That's being taken as an apparent sign that AMD's AI-powered FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling is in use in a current HLX development build, which would be another sign that HLX \"legitimately is nearing the end of development,\" as McVicker puts it. \"You don't use FSR until you're nearly done with a game. Those AI post-processing systems are not supposed to be used for development.\""

      "text": "HOLLOW KNIGHT: SILKSONG REVEALED!\nNo time for fluff today gang. Let\u2019s leap straight in for the big reveal, in trailer form!\nHollow Knight: Silksong is the second game by Team Cherry (that\u2019s us!) and the full-scale sequel to Hollow Knight.\nAnd Pwoarrrrrrowza! if this one hasn\u2019t been a struggle to keep under-wraps! Hidden behind the scenes, Hornet\u2019s gigantic adventure has been growing (and growing and growing!) for well over a year now, with the very first pieces coming together right after the original PC release of Hollow Knight on Feb 24th 2017.\nAlmost from the very start, Hornet\u2019s adventure was intended to take place in a new land, but as we dove in, it quickly became too large and too unique to stay a DLC, as initially planned. We do know that makes the wait a little longer, but we think the final, fresh world you\u2019ll get to explore is worth it.\nHollow Knight: Silksong will be available, at launch, on Windows, Mac, Linux & Nintendo Switch. More platforms may happen! Just remember, we\u2019re 3 people, already working rather hard, so we haven\u2019t committed to anything else just yet. We don\u2019t wanna collapse before we get this massive bug kingdom ready for you.\nEager to know more about Hollow Knight: Silksong, then we\u2019ve lots of options: You can dive into the text below; jump over to the brand new website hollowknightsilksong.com(we made this yesterday!); or you can watch us go through it all in casual video form!\nAs Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, adventure through a whole new kingdom haunted by silk and song. Captured and brought to an unfamiliar land, Hornet must battle foes and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom\u2019s peak.\nHollow Knight: Silksong is the epic sequel to Hollow Knight, the award winning action-adventure of bugs and heroes. As the lethal hunter Hornet, journey to all-new lands, discover new powers, battle vast hordes of bugs and beasts and uncover ancient secrets tied to your nature and your past.\nGame Features\nDiscover a whole new kingdom! Explore coral forests, mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors as you ascend to the shining citadel at the top of the world.\nEngage in lethal acrobatic action! Wield a whole new suite of nimble moves as you dance between foes in deadly, beautiful combat.\nCraft powerful tools! Master an ever-expanding arsenal of weapons, traps and mechanisms to confound your enemies and explore new heights.\nSolve shocking quests! Hunt down rare beasts, unearth ancient mysteries and search for lost treasures to fulfil the wishes of the downtrodden and restore the kingdom\u2019s hope. Prepare for the unexpected!\nFace over 150 all-new foes! Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights \u2013 defeat them all with bravery and skill!\nExperience a stunning orchestral score! Hollow Knight\u2019s award-winning composer, Christopher Larkin, returns to bring melancholy melodies, symphonic strings and heart-thumping, soul strumming boss themes to the adventure.\nChallenge Silk Soul mode! Once you conquer the game, test your skills in an all-new mode that spins the game into a unique, challenging experience.\nKickstarter Specifics\nTo our 2158 Backers, you\u2019ve heard it before, but Hollow Knight, and now Hornet\u2019s entire adventure is thanks to you!\nThanks to the incredible support of players and Kickstarter backers, what started out as a tiny game jam idea has become a game bought and played by over 2.8 million people!\nAs a backer, your support made this happen, so you\u2019ll of course be receiving your copy of Hollow Knight: Silksong 100% free.\nBut we also know that times change, and the Nintendo Switch is quickly becoming a common (and excellent) console to own. Because of that, any backer of the game from the $10AUD and above tiers can choose to receive their copy of Hollow Knight: Silksong free on either PC or Nintendo Switch, at launch. We\u2019ll shoot out a simple survey as we get closer to release to find out which version you\u2019d like to receive.\nHigher tier backers who received multiple copies of Hollow Knight will also receive multiple copies of Hollow Knight: Silksong, the same rules apply as for Hollow Knight. You can elect for your primary copy on either Nintendo Switch or PC, with all additional copies as PC versions.\nHollow Knight: Silksong PC (Windows, Mac & Linux) copies will be supplied as both a Steam Key and a DRM free version.\nFor Silksong, backer content is again seamlessly integrated into the main game. Get ready to dance with operatic queens, battle mysterious assassins, scale a soaring warlord\u2019s tower, and that\u2019s just to start! If you\u2019re one of those backers, and haven\u2019t heard from us recently, don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ll be reaching out in the near future as we lock down the remaining pieces.\nWith Silksong finally out in the open, expect lots more details in the near future. For now though, the three of us are diving back in to build this big, wild, elegant, insane world of knights, princesses, beasts and bugs!\nTeam Cherry Out!"
