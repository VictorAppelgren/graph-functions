(Uwe Anspach/dpa via AP)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Erik ten Hag made a winning start as Bayer Leverkusen coach with a 4-0 result at fourth-tier team Sonnenhof Gro\u00dfaspach in the first round of the German Cup on Friday.\n\nPatrik Schick, Brazilian wing back Arthur, debutant Christian Kofane and \u00c1lex Grimaldo all scored, but they assumed control only after Gro\u00dfaspach captain Volkan Celikwas was sent off in the 66th with two bookings in as many minutes.\n\nLeverkusen was forced to defend for long periods after Schick\u2019s 32nd-minute opener. The Czech forward also needed to clear the ball off the line.\n\nArthur scored the second shortly after Celikwas\u2019 sending off and the other goals followed Mert Tasdelen\u2019s late sending off for a bad challenge on Leverkusen defender Axel Tape.\n\nTen Hag, the former Manchester United manager, took over from the Real Madrid-bound Xabi Alonso and has had little time to work with a squad undergoing huge changes. Key players like Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Granit Xhaka have left while Kofane, Tape, Ibrahim Maza, Jarell Quansah and goalkeeper Mark Flekken all made their debuts on Friday.\n\nThe game was interrupted in the first half by a summer storm featuring hailstones. Referee Michael Bacher led the teams off the field. It resumed after a 40-minute break.\n\nUnion used dead-ball situations to take a 3-0 halftime lead, with Robert Skov firing in a free kick, and Leopold Querfeld and Danilho Doekhi scoring after corners.\n\nUnion goalkeeper Frederik R\u00f6nnow had to go off early in the second half after indicating he was feeling dizzy. Matheo Raab went on for his Union debut but had little to do as Andrej Ili\u0107 scored and then set up Jeong Woo-yeong to complete the rout.",
