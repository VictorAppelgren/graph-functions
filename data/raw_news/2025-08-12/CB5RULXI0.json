However, before using any AI-generated content, you must discuss the purpose and how it was produced with your editor. This policy aims to provide ethical guidelines for journalists using AI-generated content: whether written, visual, or audio to ensure that their reporting is transparent, accurate, fair, and accountable.\n- If you and your editor decide AI-generated or assisted content is acceptable or warranted, these are our guidelines.\nTRANSPARENCY & DISCLOSURE\n- AI is not transparent about its own sources. Until sourcing transparency improves, journalists need to treat AI-gen content as they would \u201coff the record\u201d sources, meaning it can be used for ideas and leads, but we need to confirm whatever it tells us with an \u201con the record\u201d source.\nACCURACY & VERIFICATION\n- If AI-assisted content is approved for publication, journalists must disclose the use of AI and its limitations to their audience. AI-generated content must be verified for accuracy and factuality before being used in reporting. Journalists must ensure that the content they use is accurate and free of errors.\nEDITORIAL JUDGMENT\n- Journalists must maintain their professional judgment and decision-making abilities when using AI-generated content. They must ensure that the content they use meets our editorial standards and values.\nFAIR USE\n- Journalists must comply with the legal and ethical considerations of fair use when using AI-generated content. They must ensure that they do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nAI VISUAL TOOLS (Dall-E & Others)\n- AI-generated visual content is illustrative, does not accurately represent a real situation, and is not an accurate rendition of a genuine moment or news situation. There is an extremely high bar for the potential use of AI-generated visual content, requiring full disclosure to the viewer. Gannett does not use AI-generated photo-realistic images in our news coverage. Any use of visual AI should be approved by a managing editor or higher, the photo and video director, or the standards editor.\nPRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION\n- Journalists must ensure that the use of AI-generated content does not violate the privacy rights of individuals. They must ensure that the data used to generate content is collected and used in compliance with data protection laws.\nBIAS & DISCRIMINATION\n- Journalists must be aware of any potential biases in the AI-generated content they use. They must ensure that the content they use does not discriminate against any individual or group based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.\nSAFETY & SECURITY\n- Journalists must be mindful of the potential risks of using AI-generated content for public safety and security. They must ensure that the content they use does not contribute to disinformation or misinformation that may cause harm.\nACCOUNTABILITY & RESPONSIBILITY\n- Journalists must take responsibility for any errors or inaccuracies in the AI-generated content they use. They must be accountable to their audience and take corrective action if errors are found.\nINCLUSIVITY & DIVERSITY\n- Journalists must ensure that they are inclusive and diverse in their use of AI-generated content. They must ensure that the content they use reflects the diversity of their audience.\nTRAINING & DEVELOPMENT\n- Journalists must receive adequate training and development to use AI-generated content effectively and ethically.

Gannett takes the use of AI-generated content very seriously and has put in place several safeguards to protect our intellectual property and ensure AI is used responsibly and ethically.
