  "content": "Japanese nail salon operator Convano has officially launched its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition strategy, following its ambitious plan to raise approximately \u00a5434 billion ($3 billion) to purchase 21,000 Bitcoin, equivalent to 0.1% of the total supply.\n\nAccording to an August 30 Bloomberg report, the Tokyo-listed nail salon company plans to become one of the world\u2019s largest corporate Bitcoin holders.\n\nIn response, Taiyo Azuma, Director of Convano\u2019s BTC Holding Strategy Office, outlined a three-phase Bitcoin acquisition plan, with a target of 2,000 BTC by the end of 2025.\n\nThe portfolio is expected to reach 10,000 BTC by August 2026, as Azuma stated, \u201cOur goal is clear. By March 2027, we aim to acquire 21,000 BTC and become one of the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin-holding companies.\u201c\n\nConvano frames its BTC pivot as a strategic response to macroeconomic challenges.\n\nA prolonged decline in the yen, approximately 21% weaker against the dollar over the past decade, has increased costs for wages and raw materials in its consumer services business.\n\n\u201cWe started to think about Bitcoin because of persistent yen depreciation and geopolitical risks,\u201d Azuma told Bloomberg. \u201cBitcoin is a long-term store of value.\u201d\n\nOf the funds Convano has raised to date, \u00a54.5 billion came from corporate bonds, and it has acquired 365 Bitcoin with it.\n\nThe Bitcoin acquisition announcement has driven Convano\u2019s stock higher, with shares climbing 223.27% in the past month and surging 1,414.68% YTD.\n\nJapan has become an unexpected hub for Bitcoin accumulation through publicly listed companies.\n\nMetaplanet Inc., a former hotel operator, now holds nearly 19,000 Bitcoin, ranking among the top 10 global holders.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Treasuries, seven Japanese companies now rank among the top 100 public firms holding BTC.\n\nHowever, the sustainability of crypto treasury strategies remains a topic of debate.\n\nBitcoin acquisition leaders like StrategyB (formerly MicroStrategy) face challenges as MSTR stock has declined 15.35% over the past 30 days while Bitcoin trades 12.85% below its two-week high of $124,457.\n\nIf StrategyB could face this risk, a heavy drop in Convani stock means its financing model can collapse.\n\nWhen asked about concerns regarding Bitcoin price volatility, Azuma believes the perceived risk is actually beneficial.\n\nAccording to him, Convano welcomes Bitcoin price drops for four reasons.\n\nFirst, lower prices allow the company to acquire more Bitcoin. Secondly, higher volatility increases the company\u2019s revenue.",

      "text": "Japanese investment company Metaplanet has approved a plan to raise 180.3 billion yen ($1.2 billion) through an overseas share issuance, with nearly $837 million earmarked for fresh Bitcoin purchases.\nThe move, disclosed in a Wednesday filing, shows the Tokyo-listed firm\u2019s aggressive pivot into digital assets and its ambition to cement its position as one of the world\u2019s largest corporate holders of Bitcoin.\nMetaplanet Turns to Overseas Investors for $1.2B Bitcoin Treasury Expansion\nThe company said it intends to issue up to 555 million new shares, which could expand its total outstanding stock from 722 million to approximately 1.27 billion shares.\nThe offering price will be determined between September 9 and September 11 through a bookbuilding process, with payments scheduled to settle shortly after.\nThe share issuance will take place exclusively in overseas markets, with sales in the United States limited to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act.\nAccording to Metaplanet, the bulk of the proceeds, around 123.8 billion yen ($837 million), will be allocated to Bitcoin purchases between September and October 2025.\nAnother 6.5 billion yen ($45 million) will be directed toward its Bitcoin Income Generation business, where the company earns revenue by selling options against its holdings.\nThese buys pushed its total stash up from 18,113 BTC in the previous quarter, extending a steady accumulation drive that began in April 2024 when the company rebranded itself as a \u201cBitcoin treasury company.\u201d\nCEO Simon Gerovich, a former Goldman Sachs derivatives trader, has overseen the company\u2019s dramatic transformation from a hotel management business into Asia\u2019s most prominent corporate Bitcoin holder.\nMetaplanet Shareholder Base Surges 1,000% as Bitcoin Strategy Gains Global Spotlight\nMetaplanet\u2019s strategy mirrors that of U.S. software firm Strategy, which pioneered the use of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve. Like its American counterpart, the Japanese firm funds acquisitions through capital market raises, including share issuances and bond programs.\nEarlier this year, it redeemed 3 billion yen ($20.4 million) of its 19th Series Ordinary Bonds to optimize liabilities while continuing to scale its Bitcoin holdings.\nThe company argues that its aggressive Bitcoin strategy is rooted in Japan\u2019s challenging macroeconomic conditions, marked by high national debt, prolonged negative real interest rates, and a weakening yen.\nBy shifting its reserves into Bitcoin, Metaplanet says it aims to hedge against inflation, currency depreciation, and broader instability in the global monetary system. Management also highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, portability, and transparency as reasons for treating it as a superior reserve asset compared with traditional safe havens such as government bonds.\nAs of June 30, Metaplanet had 128,000 shareholders, a figure that has surged by more than 1,000% in the past year thanks to its high-profile Bitcoin accumulation. The company has also become a focal point for global institutional investors, with the upcoming international offering designed to deepen access to long-term overseas capital and improve liquidity for its shares.\nWith 18,991 BTC already on its balance sheet, Metaplanet now ranks as the fourth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally and the largest in Asia. Industry observers have increasingly referred to the company as \u201cAsia\u2019s MicroStrategy,\u201d a label reinforced by its bold financing strategies and its rapid rise into the upper echelon of public Bitcoin holders.\nThe company\u2019s filing confirmed that the international offering will go ahead only if shareholders approve an increase in the total number of authorized shares at an extraordinary general meeting on September 1.\nIf approved, the share sale will significantly expand Metaplanet\u2019s capital base, setting the stage for its next wave of Bitcoin acquisitions and reinforcing its role as one of the most aggressive corporate buyers in the digital asset market.\nJapan\u2019s push for clearer regulation is fueling a wave of corporate crypto adoption. The Financial Services Agency plans to classify digital assets as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by 2026, while proposed tax reforms could cut capital gains on crypto to a flat 20% from rates as high as 55%.\nFinance Minister Katsunobu Kato reinforced this direction at the WebX2025 forum in Tokyo, highlighting digital assets\u2019 potential in diversified portfolios.\nAmid the policy shift, Tokyo-listed firms are ramping up Bitcoin holdings. Five companies, including Metaplanet, disclosed new allocations this week, adding 156.79 BTC to their reserves.\nEnergy firm Remixpoint led with 41.5 BTC ($4.6M), bringing its total to 1,273 BTC, ranking among the top 40 global corporate holders.\nFashion retailer ANAP Holdings lifted its balance to 1,017 BTC, while Agile Media Network added 0.59 BTC. Def Consulting also confirmed a new treasury program."

The company will raise funds through bonds and share issuance, targeting 2,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 10,000 BTC by August\u202f2026. Convano\u2019s move follows a trend of Japanese firms, such as Metaplanet, expanding crypto treasuries amid a weak yen and regulatory shifts. The announcement has lifted Convano\u2019s stock, which surged over 1,400\u202f% YTD, while the market watches the sustainability of corporate crypto holdings.",
