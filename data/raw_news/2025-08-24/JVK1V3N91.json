  "description": "Uber CEO offers insight on camera vs LiDAR debate in AVs, says safety needs superhuman levels to ensure smooth operations.",
  "content": "Uber Technologies Inc. UBER CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has offered his insight into the camera vs LiDAR system debate amid the U.S.'s self-driving push.\n\nCamera-Based Systems \u2018Difficult' To Employ In The Near Term\n\nSpeaking on a podcast hosted by an Indian entrepreneur, Nikhil Kamath, on Sunday, Khosrowshahi said that he believes AVs (Autonomous Vehicles) need to have \"superhuman levels of safety,\" which exceeds human abilities by multitudes, adding that Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL GOOG Waymo has proven it to be possible.\n\n\"I think in the near term, it's going to be very difficult and Elon [Musk] would tell me I'm wrong,\" Khosrowshahi said before adding that it was a possibility for a camera-only system to achieve superhuman safety levels \"at some point in the future.\"\n\nHe then mentioned that all of Uber's partners were using a combination of LiDAR and camera-based tech, which Khosrowshahi thinks is the \"right solution.\"\n\nFollowing the interview, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to the social media platform X on Sunday, doubling down on camera-only systems.\n\n\u201cLidar and radar reduce safety due to sensor contention. If lidars/radars disagree with cameras, which one wins?\u201d Musk said in the post, adding that Waymo autonomous cabs can\u2019t drive on highways due to increased sensor ambiguity.\n\n\u201cWe turned off the radars in Teslas to increase safety. Cameras ftw,\u201d Musk said in the post.\n\nThe interview comes as Uber's self-driving push gathers steam amid deals with Lucid Group Inc. LCID as well as self-driving company Nuro Inc. to deploy over 20,000 Robotaxis over the next six years.\n\nUber also says that customers on its platform are actively ditching human drivers for Robotaxis in Atlanta, where the company offers Waymo self-driving cabs.\n\nUber also invested in Nuro, which is now valued at $6 billion following series E funding, where the company raised over $203 million with other backers including Nvidia Corp NVDA.\n\nThe ride-hailing giant also announced a new incentive program for drivers in Colorado, offering $2,000 in benefits for switching to EVs, in addition to other state incentives.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla Inc. TSLA FSD, or Full Self-Driving system, has been facing hurdles in the form of lawsuits filed against the company over misleading FSD capabilities, as well as a lawsuit filed by investors over FSD's safety concerns.\n\nThis comes as the NHTSA also announced it has launched an investigation into Tesla's delay in submitting self-driving crash reports, which the company said occurred due to data collection snags.\n\nElsewhere, Tesla has been criticized for its Robotaxis by experts, including former Waymo CEO John Krafcik, who slammed the effort as not being a \"real Robotaxi\" due to the presence of an onboard safety driver.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, is pushing on with Robotaxi testing, with a new job listing on the company's website showcasing an open position for a test driver in NYC to conduct trials and test runs of its Robotaxi in the city.\n\nUber scores well on Momentum and Growth metrics, while offering satisfactory Value.

      "text": "Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL GOOG autonomous taxi service Waymo's former CEO, John Krafick, is skeptical about Tesla Inc.'s TSLA Robotaxi.\n\u2018Not A Robotaxi' Says John Krafcik\n\"Please let me know when Tesla launches a robotaxi, I\u2019m still waiting,\" Krafcik said, adding that the company's ride-hailing service is not a Robotaxi since \"there\u2019s an employee inside the car,\" Business Insider reported on Sunday.\nKrafcik also maintained that he had no interest in trying the Tesla robotaxi, the report suggests. He also criticized the company's ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, comparing it with Uber Technologies Inc. UBER.\n\"If they were striving to re-create today\u2019s Bay Area Uber experience, looks like they\u2019ve absolutely nailed it,\" Krafcik said in the report.\nElon Musk Reacts\nFollowing Krafcik's comments, influencer Whole Mars Catalog took to social media platform X on Sunday, criticizing Krafcik. Replying to the post, Elon Musk also slammed Robotaxi critics.\n\"They will switch from claiming that Tesla self-driving is fake to Tesla self-driving is unfairly good,\" Musk said in the post.\nTesla's Bay Area Expansion, Musk's Ambitious Robotaxi Goal\nTesla currently operates an invite-only ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, ever since Musk announced the company would be expanding into the region.\nHowever, the company's service has an onboard safety driver at all times since Tesla cannot operate Robotaxis in the state of California, as it does not have a permit.\nThe expansion follows Musk laying out the ambitious goal of serving over half the population of the U.S. with Tesla Robotaxis by the end of the year, which he shared during the company's second-quarter earnings call.\nTesla's Norway Defiance\nAmid the robotaxi expansions, Tesla has been grappling with poor sales figures across multiple regions in the world, with UK sales falling over 60% in July as Tesla delivered 987 units in the country.\nHowever, the Norwegian market has emerged as a defiant region for the company, as sales surged 24% in Norway with Tesla registering over 13,039 deliveries.\nTesla scores well on Momentum, Growth, and Quality metrics, but offers poor Value.

TSLA, another key player in the autonomous taxi industry, has been on the receiving end of criticism from former Waymo CEO John Krafcik, who says the company's ride-hailing service isn't a Robotaxi due to the presence of a safety driver onboard the vehicle at all times.\nUber offers Satisfactory Value, but scores well on the Momentum and Growth metrics.

Pricing for the other variants in the line remains unchanged.\nThe Cyberbeast trim offers a 0-60 mph time of 2.6 seconds and an EPA range of 320 miles on a single charge with a tri-motor all-wheel drive system and premium interiors.\nSource: Tesla\nCybertruck's 5-Star NHTSA Rating, Piling Inventories\nThe news comes as the Cybertruck received a 5-star crash test rating for both the driver as well as the passenger by the NHTSA. The pickup truck earlier received a 5-star rating only for the driver, while securing a 4-star rating for the passenger.\nDespite the Cybertruck's safety rating and its build quality, however, Tesla hasn't been able to sell units. The EV giant is said to be sitting on an inventory worth $200 million and is also accepting trade-ins for the vehicle, less than 2 years after its release.\nTesla's Broader Sales Woes, FSD Lawsuits\nThe price rise also comes as Tesla's broader sales have been lackluster, with the company recording double-digit drops in markets like the UK as well as other parts of Europe like Sweden, Denmark and France.\nAdding to the challenge are lawsuits that Elon Musk's company is currently facing over its FSD system, with a California judge certifying a class action lawsuit against Tesla for \"misleading\" claims about FSD's capabilities.\nTesla scores well on Momentum and Growth metrics, while offering satisfactory Quality, but poor Value.

The company said that an additional $97 million in funding follows the initial 106 million the company raised in April this year.\n\"The closing of our Series E reinforces the strong conviction our investors and strategic partners have in Nuro's technology,\" Nuro's co-founder and President Dave Ferguson said in the statement. The CEO also teased new partnerships coming in the future.\nNuro's Robotaxi Push With Lucid And Uber, Nvidia Halts H20 Chip\nThe news comes as Nuro has become a key figure in the $300 million partnership with Lucid Group Inc.

Tesla recently also expanded its ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nHowever, the plans have faced criticism from experts, including Gerber Kawasaki's co-founder Ross Gerber, who slammed the EV giant for calling its ride-hailing service the \"Robotaxi.\"\n\"Tesla should consider calling things by the right names. Not wild exaggerations,\" Gerber said. He also added that the term \"Supervised Full Self-Driving\" was \"an oxymoron.\"\nTesla scores well on Momentum, Quality and Growth metrics, but offers poor Value.
