  "content": "The country's largest private prison companies are reporting significant profits amid an aggressive push by the Trump administration to increase immigration arrests and detentions.\n\nDuring earnings calls last week, executives with the firms Geo Group and CoreCivic announced an increase in revenue from new and current contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and discussed their plans to expand their businesses to meet the administration's demands.\n\n\"Our business is perfectly aligned with the demands of this moment,\" said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger. \"We are in an unprecedented environment with rapid increases in federal detention populations nationwide and a continuing need for solutions.\"\n\nMORE: Executives at private prison firm CoreCivic expect 'significant growth' due to Trump's policies\n\nCoreCivic reported a total revenue of $538.2 million during their second quarter, a 9.8% increase from the same quarter in 2024.\n\nDuring the call, Hininger told investors the company is evaluating additional opportunities for expansion and said that CoreCivic facilities are \"the most humane, most efficient logistically, have the highest audit compliance scores in their system, and are more secure [and] weatherproof.\"\n\nHininger said that while ICE has recently been using \"soft-sided solutions\" like the tent facilities at Guantanamo Bay and at Florida's \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center, he believes the agency \"does not see soft-sided facilities as long-term solutions.\"\n\n\"In the days since the election, the message has been pretty darn clear from the administration, DHS leadership, and ICE leadership that detention is going to be the priority,\" Hininger said, adding that the company has been \"working around the clock\" to open up bed space and new detention facilities.\n\nGeo Group, ICE's largest contractor, reported total second-quarter revenue of $636.2 million, a 5% increase from the second quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring their earnings call last week, Geo Group Chairman George Zoley said the utilization of their current ICE contracts increased from 15,000 beds to 20,000 beds, which Zoley said is the highest level of ICE utilization in the company's history.\n\n\"All of these efforts are aimed at placing our company in the best competitive position possible to pursue what we continue to believe are unprecedented growth opportunities as a long-standing support services provider for ICE,\" said Zoley.\n\n\"We believe we are uniquely positioned to assist the agency to meet its objectives,\" Zoley said.",

      "text": "In Trump's mass deportation plan, the private prison industry sees a lucrative opportunity\nAn executive said the plan could mean a \"potential sea change\" for the industry.\nAs the government and law enforcement brace for the sweeping ramifications of President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to deport what could be millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, another stakeholder appears poised to cash in on the complex logistics that would be required: the powerful private prison industry.\nOn corporate earnings calls since Election Day, executives at the country's top private prison firms have embraced Trump's immigration agenda as a potential windfall if the federal government requires contractors to construct new detention facilities and provide additional support services for the unprecedented effort.\nGeo Group founder George Zoley, whose company is the country's largest private prison operator, told investors last week that Trump's deportation plans represent a \"potential sea change\" for the industry.\n\"The Geo Group was built for this unique moment in our history and the opportunities that it will bring,\" Zoley said.\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has for years relied on private companies to house detained migrants, making it a multimillion-dollar business. That industry is expected to grow under Trump and his newly tapped border czar, Tom Homan, who has embraced Trump's promise to undertake mass deportations on \"Day 1\" of the new administration.\nJohn Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE, said he expects the Trump administration to offer \"massive contracts\" to the major players in the private prison industry.\n\"[Trump] is going to rely heavily on them,\" Sandweg told ABC News. \"Those private contractors are going to make billions, legitimate billions off this.\"\nThe two largest private prison companies -- Geo Group and CoreCivic -- saw their stocks surge after the election last week.\nUnder the first Trump administration, the number of immigrants detained in private detention facilities grew to a record high, according to a 2019 report from the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for humane treatment of prisoners.\n\"The Trump administration's immigration policies, as well as existing immigration legislation, create structural incentives to increase detention, which has largely been achieved through the use of private prisons,\" the report said.\nFor years, many Democratic lawmakers have called for an end to the federal government's use of private prisons due to what they say is inadequate oversight in private facilities that results in underreported health and safety violations. In a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in May, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats urged Mayorkas to phase out ICE's use of private detention after President Joe Biden sought to phase out the use of private prisons at the federal level.\n\"Upon termination of contracts, ICE should pursue community-based alternatives to detention, which provide immigrants with resources that help them integrate into their communities and stay with their families,\" the letter said.\nEunice Cho, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project told ABC News in a statement that ICE opened up 40 new detention facilities during the Trump administration, with the majority of beds -- over 90% -- going to private prison companies.\n\"There is little doubt that private prison companies will profit handsomely under the Trump administration and its attacks against immigrant communities,\" Cho said. \"The true cost, however, will be borne by people who will be locked up in dangerous, deadly, and inhumane immigrant detention centers, where private prison companies are accountable to one thing: the bottom line.\"\nHoman, himself a former ICE director, has fiercely defended the use of private facilities to house ICE detainees, arguing they allow \"higher quality and lower cost than the government can provide.\"\n\"Using outside contractors that run facilities like this as their core business function saves millions of dollars in taxpayer funds and increases the quality of care those being detained receive,\" Homan wrote in his 2020 book, \"Defend the Border and Save Lives.\"\nHoman has framed the use of private facilities as a legal necessity because ICE is legally required to detain most of the undocumented immigrants they arrest -- and most states lack enough government-run facilities to house them. Even if states pass laws prohibiting the use of private prisons, Homan said ICE would continue the use of the private facilities.\nOn Geo Group's earnings call last week, Zoley and other executives said they have the \"necessary technology and staffing resources to significantly scale up the delivery\" of services if needed. The company already has thousands of unused beds available, including 10,000 beds at six company facilities and 8,000 beds at existing ICE and U.S. Marshals facilities that are already under contract.\nExecutives from CoreCivic said during a recent earnings call that they were already taking steps to make additional beds available in anticipation of the need once Trump is sworn into office.\n\"It feels like with the election this year, we're heading into an era that we really haven't seen,\" said one CoreCivic executive."

We've got DOGE out there looking at the best value for the government,\" Hininger said, referencing Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe CoreCivic CEO also said he believes the company's facilities are less likely to face litigation, and said they are \"more humane than the other alternatives.\"\n\"We're feeling very encouraged by the conversations with ICE to date,\" Hininger said. \"We've got a lot of activity going on in the organization, a lot of opportunities, so it's a very exciting time within the company.\""

      "text": "Judge temporarily blocks further construction of 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention center\nAny further construction must be halted for 14 days, the judge ruled.\nA federal judge on Thursday temporarily halted any further construction of the immigrant detention center known as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"\nU.S. District Judge Kathleen Mary Williams granted a temporary restraining order after two days of testimony about the environmental impact of the site.\nThe state of Florida and President Donald Trump's administration can continue to use the facility and house detainees there, but any further construction must be halted for 14 days.\nWhile the hearing was set to resume on Tuesday, Judge Williams granted the temporary order to prevent possible harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem in the meantime\nEnvironmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida had urged Judge Williams to block the construction site because the detention center was completed without conducting necessary impact studies. The area is home to multiple sensitive species -- including the endangered Florida Panther -- and is considered sacred to the Miccosukee tribe.\n\"We welcome the court's decision to pause construction on this deeply concerning project. The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people. While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to stand for our culture, our sovereignty, and the Everglades,\" Miccosukee Chairman Talbert Cypress said in a statement.\nDuring the court proceedings on Thursday, the plaintiffs asked the judge for the restraining order citing fears that additional construction work, including paving work, would take place over the weekend ahead of the next court appearance, according to the judge's order.\nDuring the hearing Thursday, two experts told the judge that at least 20 acres of the site had been newly paved with asphalt, resulting in some 800,000 square feet of paving that, the experts testified, presented risks of runoff contamination into the natural water system around the site.\nA spokesperson for Florida AG James Uthmeier's office released a statement to ABC News in response to the judge's ruling.\n\"Judge Williams' order is wrong, and we will fight it. However, it does not shut down Alligator Alcatraz, which will continue to send illegal aliens back to where they came from,\" the statement read.\nThe judge's decision on Thursday comes after Wednesday's hearing only saw five witnesses called to the stand by the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit, instead of the multiple state and federal officials who were set to testify.\nAt issue is the question of whether federal and state officials bypassed legally required environmental impact studies during construction of the facility -- which plaintiffs say should block it from being used as a detention center.\nAttorneys representing Florida officials have argued that the facility was initially funded by, constructed and managed by the state and is therefore exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act -- the main law being used to challenge the facility's compliance.\nAlligator Alcatraz has so far operated in what immigration advocates have described as a jurisdictional gray zone -- with the facility funded by the federal government but run by the state of Florida -- that they allege allows officials to skirt some legal requirements.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has previously argued that the state of Florida is \"implementing\" the federal government's immigration policy with the expectation that the state would be fully reimbursed for the costs of Alligator Alcatraz, but local and federal officials have so far been unable to tell the federal courts who is actually in charge of the facility.\nThe hearing -- at which federal, state, and tribal officials are testifying -- comes amid heightened scrutiny of the facility, which was once touted as a \"one-stop shop to carry out President Trump's mass deportation agenda.\"\nLocated 50 miles west of Miami in the heart of the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz was quickly constructed over a matter of weeks, utilizing hundreds of tents, trailers, and other temporary facilities to potentially house more than 3,000 detainees.\nThe facility was built on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, a sparsely used piece of tarmac owned by Miami-Dade County.\nAlligator Alcatraz also neighbors land leased to the Miccosukee Indian Tribe, including villages, a school, traditional hunting areas, and sacred sites. The Miccosukee Tribe joined the lawsuit last month, arguing that the facility threatens to damage nearby tribal villages."
