  "description": "Injured Ireland back row Dorothy Wall says Ireland ended their eight-year World Cup wait with one of their \"best ever performances\" against Japan.",
  "content": "For Ireland, eight years was - at least for now - worth the wait.\n\nFor women's rugby in Ireland, the gap between World Cup appearances featured the scarring lows of a shock qualifying elimination in 2021, a Six Nations wood spoon and concerns over facilities and playing conditions.\n\nHowever, the rebuild under Scott Bemand over the past two years has been impressive - and perhaps swifter than many would have anticipated.\n\nThere were the confidence-boosting scalps of New Zealand and Australia last year, and a return to form in the Six Nations.\n\nAnd when the time for talking was over as Ireland returned to the sport's biggest stage on Sunday, they delivered in style against Japan.\n\n\"It was amazing, I'm so proud of each and every one of them,\" said injured Ireland back row Dorothy Wall.\n\n\"It's probably one of the best performances we've ever put in as a team.\n\n\"From set piece to how we managed the game, we executed well and I'm so proud of the entire squad.\"\n\nFormer Ireland forward and BBC Sport pundit Anna Caplice added Ireland had \"turned it around\" after a difficult few years.\n\n\"Japan aren't to be messed around with,\" she said.\n\n\"It was never going to be a gimme. So to put in a full 80-minute performance was brilliant for Ireland.\"",
