  "content": "An illegal immigrant was arrested in South Dakota while transporting $12 million in methamphetamine \u2014 the largest single seizure of the drug in the state Highway Patrol\u2019s history, Gov. Larry Rhoden announced on Monday.\n\nThe 42-year-old man, who was not identified, was pulled over during a traffic stop by South Dakota Highway Patrol while he was speeding on Interstate 90 in Sturgis, roughly 100 miles west of the Wyoming border, according to a press release from the governor\u2019s office.\n\nTurns out, the driver was carting a staggering 207 pounds of crystal meth in his vehicle \u2014 roughly the same weight of an adult black bear.\n\nAuthorities emptied out his vehicle and recovered stash, which has a street value of approximately $12 million, according to the release.\n\nThe suspect was \u201cfound to be a non-citizen and is now in immigration proceedings,\u201d according to the release. His country of origin and where he was detained is unclear.\n\nThe drug bust was part of the governor\u2019s Operation Prairie Thunder, which allows law enforcement in the state to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe are taking action to protect the people of South Dakota from criminals and drug traffickers. Our Highway Patrol showed incredible professionalism in achieving this record drug bust,\u201d Roden said.\n\n\u201cI promised that my administration would keep South Dakota strong, safe, and free \u2013 and we will continue to deliver on that promise through Operation: Prairie Thunder.\u201d\n\nIn early 2025, Roden also entered into an agreement with ICE that gave the state\u2019s Highway Patrol officers the ability to \u201cperform certain immigration enforcement functions,\u201d including the power to arrest without a warrant.\n\nThe 287(g) Task Force agreements were discontinued under the Obama and Biden administrations, but reintroduced by President Trump on the day of his inauguration.\n\nAs of May 2025, 40 states have at least one active 287(g) Task Force agreement in place, according to ICE.\n\nOther agencies involved in the investigation include the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Meade County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Rapid City Police Department, according to the release.",

Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14159, Protecting the American People Against Invasion. This EO requires ICE to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines are qualified and appropriate, under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. Several states, including but not limited to Georgia and Florida, have passed, or are considering, State legislation mandating law enforcement agencies (LEAs) seek out or enter into memorandums of agreement (MOA) with ICE pursuant to a partnership under the 287(g) Program.\nParticipation in the 287(g) Program is limited to LEAs only. LEAs interested in participating in the 287(g) Program must sign an MOA with ICE. LEAs will nominate officers to participate in the 287(g) Program. Nominees must possess U.S. citizenship, complete and pass a background investigation, and have knowledge of and have enforced laws and regulations related to law enforcement activities at their jurisdictions. Task Force Model nominees must also have at least two (2) years of total sworn law enforcement officer experience. Nominees will receive training at the expense of ICE related to the immigration duties pertinent to the applicable MOA.\nLEAs interested in becoming a law enforcement partner under the 287(g) Program must submit a signed Letter of Interest and signed MOA to ICE at ERO287g@ice.dhs.gov. These forms can be found below.\nThe online process for MOAs is currently offline for revisions, please email the 287(g) program team with any questions at: ERO287g@ice.dhs.gov.\nIf you have any questions about participating in the ICE 287(g) program, how to complete the necessary forms, what is required, or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to email ERO287g@ice.dhs.gov; your inquiry will be promptly answered within one business day.\nFAQs\n- 287(g) Facts and Highlights\n- 287(g) Jail Enforcement Model Facts\n- 287(g) Task Force Model Facts\n- 287(g) Warrant Service Officer Facts\n287(g) Participating Agencies\nAs of August 11, 2025 4:06 pm, ICE has signed 900 Memorandums of Agreement for 287(g) programs covering 40 states.

He threw sunscreen at our boat trying to wake us up,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was running up and down, naked, screaming, \u2018Do something!\u2019\u201d\nSuffolk County police said the bystanders tried to resuscitate the popular designer before first responders arrived \u2014 but it was too late and Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was pronounced dead.\nThe 911 caller and his pal, regulars at the yacht club, did not recognize Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra.\nThe blue-eyed beauty hailed from the small town of Carlow, just over 50 miles outside Dublin, she said in an interview last year with the Irish Independent.\nStudious and driven to succeed, she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration and management from University College in Dublin and went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in digital marketing at the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business, also in Dublin, in 2014.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Independent.\nAt just 26, she was vice president of client experiences for an Irish-based retail marketing agency \u2014 and bored with her career, she told the outlet.\nIn 2021, she launched East x East and a fashion accessories company, Duper.\nThe companies\u2019 success was enough to allow Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra to spend her summers in the Hamptons, where she was able to mix business with pleasure.\nRyan\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a lawyer for Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was not on file."
