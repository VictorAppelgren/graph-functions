  "content": "Inger Marie Klemp: Thanks, Lars, and good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let's then turn to Slide 4, profit statement and look at some highlights. We report profit of $77.5 million or $0.35 per share and adjusted profit of $80.4 million or $0.36 per share in the second quarter of '25. The adjusted profit in the second quarter increased by $40 million compared with the previous quarter, and that was primarily due to an increase in our TCE earnings from $241 million in the previous quarter to $283 million in the second quarter as a result of higher TCE rates, partially offset by fluctuations in other income and expenses. Let's then turn to balance sheet at Slide 5.\n\nThis is up from the first quarter of the year, but admittedly somewhat short of expectations. So far in the third quarter of '25, 82% of our VLCC days are booked at $38,700 per day, 76% of our Suezmax days are booked at $37,200 per day and 73% of our LR2/Aframax days at $36,600 per day. And again, just to remind you, all these numbers are on a load-to-discharge basis with the implication of the ballast days at the end of the quarter this incurs. However, we have fixed very far into Q3 at this point in time. So there's not that much that can move the needle coming in from here.\n\nBut now we are hopefully seeing the contours of change. one being trade policy reflected in nation's behavior on crude sourcing and the simple fact that global oil demand growth has surpassed what sanctioned molecules can satisfy, meaning incremental oil demand and supply for that sake, its growth seems to benefit the compliant fleet being the market Frontline operates in. So before I give the word to Inger, I'll run through our TCE numbers on Slide 3 in the deck. In the second quarter of 2025, Frontline achieved $43,100 per day on our VLCC fleet, $38,900 per day on our Suezmax fleet and $29,300 per day on our LR2/Aframax fleet.\n\nLars H. Barstad: Thank you, Nicolas. Dear all, thank you for dialing into Frontline's quarterly earnings call. Shipping and tankers from our vantage point is still in the eye of the storm in relation to global conflict and trade policies. We have started to grow numb in respect of our industry's ability to regulate the ever-increasing parallel tanker market, stealing margins from the law-abiding citizens of the tanker trade.\n\nThe balance sheet movements this quarter are related to ordinary items. Frontline has a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity of $844 million in cash and cash equivalents, including undrawn amounts of revolver capacity, marketable securities and minimum cash requirements bank as of the end of June 30, 2025. We have no meaningful debt maturities until 2030 and no newbuilding commitments. Let's then look at Slide 6, fleet position and cash breakeven rates and OpEx. Our fleet consists of 41 VLCCs, 21 Suezmax tankers and 18 LR2 tankers. It has an average age of 7 years and consists of 100% ECO vessels, whereof 55% are scrubber-fitted.\n\nWe estimate average cash breakeven rate for the next 12 months of approximately $28,700 per day for VLCCs, $22,900 per day for Suezmax tankers and $22,900 per day for LR2 tankers, with a fleet average estimate of about $25,900 per day. This includes dry dock costs for 12 VLCCs and 8 LR2 tankers. The fleet average estimate, excluding dry dock cost is about $24,600 or $1,300 per day less. We recorded OpEx expenses, including dry dock in the second quarter of $8,700 per day for VLCCs, $8,900 per day for Suezmax tankers and $7,600 per day for LR2 tankers. This includes dry dock of one VLCC and one Suezmax tanker.\n\nAnd the Q2 '25 fleet average OpEx, excluding dry dock, was $8,100 per day. Then let us turn to Slide 7 and look at cash generation. Frontline has a substantial cash generation potential with 30,000 earnings days annually. As you can see from the graph on the left-hand side of the slide, the cash generation potential basis current fleet and TCE rates for TD TC for VLCCs, TD20 for Suezmax tankers and the average of TD25 and TC1 for Aframax and LR2 tankers from the Baltic Exchange as of August 28 '25 is $648 million or $2.91 per share. And further, a 30% increase from current spot market will increase the potential cash generation with about 64%.\n\nWith this, I leave the word to Lars, again.\n\nLars H. Barstad: Thank you very much, Inger. And let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the current market themes. So what's going on out there? The compliant tanker fleet sees improved utilization, and this is as the compliant oil export is growing and some of the trade lanes are stretching or lengthening. India and China are balancing their feedstock exposure as they're negotiating U.S. trade policies, and we've also seen increased pressure by both U.S. and EU on sanctions. We also have OPEC voluntary production cut reversals. They have yet to materially affect export volumes. And just to remind you, in the Middle East, about 20% of electricity generation comes from burning oil.\n\nSo Middle East will still kind of consume about 800,000 to 900,000 barrels per day more during the hot summer months. We do expect this to stop over the next weeks. And we also have quite exciting projections for Q4 global oil supply growth, which is supposed or at least according to EIA, give us a 3 million barrel per day year-on-year growth. If you translate that into exports, probably going to be close to 2 million barrels per day of increased exports. We are back to solid U.S. exports again after having a soft development as ever since January.\n\nAnd we look in August, at least looking at tracking, to reach 3.9 million barrels per day coming out of the U.S. Gulf. And as I'm going to come back to later, we see more and more of this oil pointing towards Asia. We've also had Brazil and Guyana production performing very, very well and likewise on their export side. The improved -- we also are in an environment here with improving refinery margins that -- which basically supports kind of refineries' crude demand and the product arbs. EIA again expect us to reach 105.4 million barrels of consumption in December globally. And we need to keep in mind this is coming from 101.5 million barrels in January.\n\nSo let's go to Slide 9 and dig a little bit into the policy and how it -- the policies and how it affects behavior. So the oil discount that countries are achieving by importing sanctioned oil versus the trade balance and then in particular, towards U.S. is an important measure for nations not embracing the current sanctions regime. To put some numbers, and this is not exact science, but just taking it off what's being reported around there, India are benefiting around $2.7 billion from -- as a discount to benchmark oil prices by importing large amounts of Russian feedstock. But there bilateral trade is tenfold of that or even more.\n\nSo about $86 billion is their trade worth with U.S. alone. It's also expected that if the U.S. tariff pressure continues on India as it is right now, they stand to lose about $20 billion of trade to the U.S. So this motivates and although not officially, but it does motivate them to change their tactics. We have, with this seen sanctioned barrels or we have seen sanctioned barrels increase their market share in key growth regions over the years, and this accelerated after 2022 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut now we're in a situation where OPEC8 voluntary production cut reversals and the supply growth, especially in Latin America, has given the market headroom to choose compliant sources of oil without affecting oil prices materially. And as global demand continues to grow, we seem to have found the limit on production and export growth from the sanctioned nations. If you look at the 2 charts on the below on the slide and look at these kind of 3 key sanctioned nations production, it seems to be tapering off. And also, if you look at their exports, it's tapering off even faster.\n\nThere is a fact that when these countries lose kind of knowledge and parts from the rest of the world in order to maintain their production levels, they tend to also lose productivity. If you look at the chart on the top right-hand side, year-on-year, China and India's compliance crude imports, we see a very positive development. Whether this is sustainable is obviously difficult to say, but we are at least moving in the right direction. Let's dig a little bit further into the flows on Slide 10. So on the top left-hand side here, we have year-on-year change in global crude production and also in global exports. Exports is the part that concerns tankers.\n\nWe've seen quite steep year-on-year changes to the positive in Q2 and also looks to come in, in Q3, and this reflects the previously mentioned increase of around 2 million barrels year-on-year in exports. This is predominantly coming from compliance sources. If you look at the chart below, we've just taken out Iranian and Russian and Venezuelan oil, and it looks very promising. If you look at the chart on the bottom right-hand side, and this is important. If you -- basically what's been missing in our market and particularly hurting Frontline has been the fact that the long-haul trade of oil has suffered.\n\nRussia has supplied Asia to a very large degree, whilst Europe has received resupply as they're missing the Russian barrels from U.S., Brazil, Guyana and West Africa. What we ideally want is Latin American and U.S. oil to go east. This is about double the voyage of this local transatlantic trades. But in order to get to that point, Atlantic Basin oil basically needs to price eastbound. It needs to be cheaper, including freight than the benchmark grade in the Middle East, which is called Dubai.\n\nWhat's happened over the last couple of weeks is with India entering the Middle East market to a larger degree now than what we used to do, they have pushed up prices in the Middle East to the point where now you can actually place U.S. barrels cheaper into the Asian market than taking it from the Middle East. Of course, it takes time for this to be reflected in rates. But what we have seen already is a significant increase in U.S. Gulf fixtures for September, which obviously is going to be October delivery than what we've seen previously. Let's move to Slide 11 and look at then the order books.\n\nSo basically, what I described on the previous slide, it basically equates to about 6% increase in freight demand, and that's not adjusting for ton miles. So the potential change here is greater. But the fleet is not really growing at all. In 2025, it's expected to be reduced by about 0.5% if you look at the active trading fleet that is either not sanctioned or sitting still. There are so few vessels coming into this market that we're actually experiencing negative growth. So with that equation together with longer trade lanes, more compliant oil in the market and a stable fleet development is good news as we move into the fall here.\n\nWe have a record amount of vessels above 20 years of age in the fleet. We have a record amount of or part of the fleet being sanctioned. And in light of that kind of setup, we continue to have a very limited order book. We also see that the activity on the yards for tankers has been fairly slow for a long period of time now, and there's only very few orders being placed. If you order a vessel today, you are 90% certain that you need to wait until 2028 to get that vessel on the water. So basically, the tanker market is sold out for 2027.\n\nThere will be transactions on resales for both '26 and '27 delivery, could even be '25. But if you go to -- if you want to increase the order book from here, 2028 is the year. So to try and sum up a little bit, and I have jokingly, but hopefully, it's not a joke, call this compliant bull market question mark. Basically, trade policy is affecting crude sourcing for the key demand regions, and this has been a little bit of a step change as far as we can see it over the last couple of months.\n\nWe see an increased utilization in the compliant fleet, and we see kind of a more healthy growth in both employment and freight as we are proceeding here. The effective tanker fleet growth remains muted, both due to the aging and -- but also, of course, due to the widening sanction reach. We have healthy refinery margins, and this is actually the first time in a while, and it's been steadily improving since November last year. We've had a seasonally strong summer market, which again kind of confirms this positive demand growth as we see it. OPEC cut reversals are expected to yield increased exports from the Middle East as we approach winter.\n\nAnd Frontline continue to retain its material upside with our modern but not the least spot-exposed fleet. Thank you. And with that, we'll open up for questions and give some answers.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Nokta with Jefferies.\n\nOmar Mostafa Nokta: Lars, Inger. Thank you for the update. Lars always very good as you kind of go through all the detail and all the moving parts in the market. I did want to maybe follow up just on a couple of those discussion points. Maybe you made a point on Slide 10 talking about those West to East flows and how those have been missing from the market. But here recently, there's perhaps a jump in terms of U.S. VLCC exports going to Asia.\n\nI guess how do you think about how that starts to play out as we get closer to winter here over the next several months where you do get an incremental amount of volume into the Middle East market from OPEC. How does that all kind of justs that dynamic overall in terms of the long haul of VLCC trade?\n\nLars H. Barstad: Well, of course, I should say Jefferies, but I have to actually lean on Goldman here. They and other kind of observers are modestly or even increasingly, bearish crude prices this winter, one being due to the return of the Middle East oil from OPEC. But secondly, that we are actually -- on supply side, we are about 1 million barrels per day north of the demand side. So it's a very good point. I don't want to be in the predicting or in the betting kind of part of this.\n\nBut I do subscribe to the idea that we could -- it's not a floating storage contango, but we could get a contango basically with -- well, I assume most of you know what the contango means that could kind of come into the oil curve this winter unless we see something very surprising on the demand side. What normally happens then on oil trade is that utilization further increases. Basically, since the future price is higher than the present price, traders and transporters of oil have no hurry to move into port to discharge. And also, it kind of -- it gives you the ability to freight oil longer.\n\nBut lastly, and the most important part, it also incentivizes people to build inventories. And that's been a big missing part as well. We do see reports of China building inventories, but the rest of OECD is kind of very, very low on the inventory side. So if that answers your question, this is a potential scenario we see play out as we come into winter.\n\nOmar Mostafa Nokta: That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up, kind of talking a bit more on the market. A big theme here over the past maybe few quarters or perhaps a couple of years is the fits and starts we've seen in the VLCC market where rates gain momentum and you think this is going to be the big shift and then they fall back and then expectations sort of get reset. Last week was a bit exciting in terms of the move in spot rates. They seem to have gapped up. And it seems maybe this week that they're holding up.\n\nWhat would you kind of attribute some of the -- I know it's very short-term thinking, but what would you attribute those recent gains to? Are you starting to actually see those export barrels from OPEC come to market? Or is it something else at play?\n\nLars H. Barstad: I think kind of what has come to motion here or gotten into the market is this shift from -- with some Russian backing up, quite a bit of Iranian backing up and that oil being replaced from the complied sources. This has kind of almost like an exponential effect on the demand for compliant tankers. So that is kind of driving it. We have this kind of magic ceiling around $50,000 per day on VLCCs, and we struggle to push through. This has something we believe with the structure of the market, we are kind of -- we are deep in the money, long-term owners of tankers. We -- for us, there shouldn't be a ceiling at all.\n\nBut if you are more on the short-term trading side, and you're taking a ship in on time charter for $40,000 per day, suddenly, you can kind of literally close the strategy with a $10,000 per day profit you do that because then you get the bonus next year and can buy yourself a new Chalet in Switzerland. And those guys have an awful lot of ships under the commercial control. So you could say that the owners have been a little bit diluted by such a presence in the spot market.\n\nWhat's encouraging right now is that I can promise you, ever since last Thursday, all the charters have been trying to push this market down as far as they could. And it seems like we are finding some support and only lost like $5,000 per day in earnings. So if this is a floor, just to put the VLCC there around $45,000 per day, then I'm actually quite optimistic that we'll be able to push through this kind of artificial ceiling at $50,000 and hopefully establish a new floor a little bit higher up.\n\nSo the waiting that's been happening now and all the fun and games to try and push this market down has meant that charters are actually starting to get a little bit -- little time to get the vessels they need in order to lift their cargoes. And that's always a very good news to the market. And it's going to be very interesting as we come to work next week and see what -- how this develops.\n\nOmar Mostafa Nokta: Okay. Yes, very good. Lars, I'll see how things indeed develop here. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Lars Barstad for closing remarks.\n\nLars H. Barstad: Well, thank you very much. I hope it's good news that there were so a few questions at this point or if it's just Friday. But thank you very much for listening in and looking forward to see how this develops.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

The call conveyed management's expectation that recent shifts in global crude flows, sustained refinery margins, and policy-driven trade changes could further boost demand for compliant tonnage as OPEC production reversals and export growth materialize in the coming quarters.\n- Barstad stated, \"The compliant tanker fleet sees improved utilization,\" as compliant oil exports and trade routes into Asia increase.\n- Klemp highlighted, \"We have no meaningful debt maturities until 2030 and no newbuilding commitments.\"\n- Management emphasized that the limited global order book and constrained yard delivery schedules through 2027 are reducing near-term fleet expansion, which may support higher TCE rates.\n- Barstad noted, \"We have this kind of magic ceiling around $50,000 per day on VLCCs, and we struggle to push through,\" but indicated that rates have recently found support near $45,000 per day for VLCCs.\n- The discussion revealed that a 30% rise in current spot market rates as of Aug. 28, 2025, could boost annual cash generation by approximately 64%.\nINDUSTRY GLOSSARY\n- ECO vessel: A tanker design standard that improves fuel efficiency and reduces emissions, typically through advanced hull forms and propulsion technology.\n- Scrubber-fitted: Refers to ships equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems that allow compliance with environmental sulfur emission limits while consuming high-sulfur fuel oil.\n- VLCC: Very Large Crude Carrier; a tanker vessel type typically carrying 2 million barrels of crude oil.\n- Suezmax: A class of tanker designed to be of the maximum size that can transit the Suez Canal when fully laden, typically carrying 1 million barrels.\n- LR2 tanker: Long Range 2 product tanker, capable of transporting roughly 80,000 to 160,000 deadweight tons of oil or refined products.\n- TCE rate: Time Charter Equivalent; a metric converting spot or contract revenues into an equivalent per-day rate, net of voyage costs.\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nLars H. Barstad: Thank you, Nicolas. Dear all, thank you for dialing into Frontline's quarterly earnings call. Shipping and tankers from our vantage point is still in the eye of the storm in relation to global conflict and trade policies. We have started to grow numb in respect of our industry's ability to regulate the ever-increasing parallel tanker market, stealing margins from the law-abiding citizens of the tanker trade.\nBut now we are hopefully seeing the contours of change. one being trade policy reflected in nation's behavior on crude sourcing and the simple fact that global oil demand growth has surpassed what sanctioned molecules can satisfy, meaning incremental oil demand and supply for that sake, its growth seems to benefit the compliant fleet being the market Frontline operates in. So before I give the word to Inger, I'll run through our TCE numbers on Slide 3 in the deck. In the second quarter of 2025, Frontline achieved $43,100 per day on our VLCC fleet, $38,900 per day on our Suezmax fleet and $29,300 per day on our LR2/Aframax fleet.\nThis is up from the first quarter of the year, but admittedly somewhat short of expectations. So far in the third quarter of '25, 82% of our VLCC days are booked at $38,700 per day, 76% of our Suezmax days are booked at $37,200 per day and 73% of our LR2/Aframax days at $36,600 per day. And again, just to remind you, all these numbers are on a load-to-discharge basis with the implication of the ballast days at the end of the quarter this incurs. However, we have fixed very far into Q3 at this point in time. So there's not that much that can move the needle coming in from here.\nAnd I'll now let Inger take you through the financial highlights.\nInger Marie Klemp: Thanks, Lars, and good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let's then turn to Slide 4, profit statement and look at some highlights. We report profit of $77.5 million or $0.35 per share and adjusted profit of $80.4 million or $0.36 per share in the second quarter of '25. The adjusted profit in the second quarter increased by $40 million compared with the previous quarter, and that was primarily due to an increase in our TCE earnings from $241 million in the previous quarter to $283 million in the second quarter as a result of higher TCE rates, partially offset by fluctuations in other income and expenses. Let's then turn to balance sheet at Slide 5.\nThe balance sheet movements this quarter are related to ordinary items. Frontline has a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity of $844 million in cash and cash equivalents, including undrawn amounts of revolver capacity, marketable securities and minimum cash requirements bank as of the end of June 30, 2025. We have no meaningful debt maturities until 2030 and no newbuilding commitments. Let's then look at Slide 6, fleet position and cash breakeven rates and OpEx. Our fleet consists of 41 VLCCs, 21 Suezmax tankers and 18 LR2 tankers. It has an average age of 7 years and consists of 100% ECO vessels, whereof 55% are scrubber-fitted.\nWe estimate average cash breakeven rate for the next 12 months of approximately $28,700 per day for VLCCs, $22,900 per day for Suezmax tankers and $22,900 per day for LR2 tankers, with a fleet average estimate of about $25,900 per day. This includes dry dock costs for 12 VLCCs and 8 LR2 tankers. The fleet average estimate, excluding dry dock cost is about $24,600 or $1,300 per day less. We recorded OpEx expenses, including dry dock in the second quarter of $8,700 per day for VLCCs, $8,900 per day for Suezmax tankers and $7,600 per day for LR2 tankers. This includes dry dock of one VLCC and one Suezmax tanker.\nAnd the Q2 '25 fleet average OpEx, excluding dry dock, was $8,100 per day. Then let us turn to Slide 7 and look at cash generation. Frontline has a substantial cash generation potential with 30,000 earnings days annually. As you can see from the graph on the left-hand side of the slide, the cash generation potential basis current fleet and TCE rates for TD TC for VLCCs, TD20 for Suezmax tankers and the average of TD25 and TC1 for Aframax and LR2 tankers from the Baltic Exchange as of August 28 '25 is $648 million or $2.91 per share. And further, a 30% increase from current spot market will increase the potential cash generation with about 64%.\nWith this, I leave the word to Lars, again.\nLars H. Barstad: Thank you very much, Inger. And let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the current market themes. So what's going on out there? The compliant tanker fleet sees improved utilization, and this is as the compliant oil export is growing and some of the trade lanes are stretching or lengthening. India and China are balancing their feedstock exposure as they're negotiating U.S. trade policies, and we've also seen increased pressure by both U.S. and EU on sanctions. We also have OPEC voluntary production cut reversals. They have yet to materially affect export volumes. And just to remind you, in the Middle East, about 20% of electricity generation comes from burning oil.\nSo Middle East will still kind of consume about 800,000 to 900,000 barrels per day more during the hot summer months. We do expect this to stop over the next weeks. And we also have quite exciting projections for Q4 global oil supply growth, which is supposed or at least according to EIA, give us a 3 million barrel per day year-on-year growth. If you translate that into exports, probably going to be close to 2 million barrels per day of increased exports. We are back to solid U.S. exports again after having a soft development as ever since January.\nAnd we look in August, at least looking at tracking, to reach 3.9 million barrels per day coming out of the U.S. Gulf. And as I'm going to come back to later, we see more and more of this oil pointing towards Asia. We've also had Brazil and Guyana production performing very, very well and likewise on their export side. The improved -- we also are in an environment here with improving refinery margins that -- which basically supports kind of refineries' crude demand and the product arbs. EIA again expect us to reach 105.4 million barrels of consumption in December globally. And we need to keep in mind this is coming from 101.5 million barrels in January.\nSo let's go to Slide 9 and dig a little bit into the policy and how it -- the policies and how it affects behavior. So the oil discount that countries are achieving by importing sanctioned oil versus the trade balance and then in particular, towards U.S. is an important measure for nations not embracing the current sanctions regime. To put some numbers, and this is not exact science, but just taking it off what's being reported around there, India are benefiting around $2.7 billion from -- as a discount to benchmark oil prices by importing large amounts of Russian feedstock. But there bilateral trade is tenfold of that or even more.\nSo about $86 billion is their trade worth with U.S. alone. It's also expected that if the U.S. tariff pressure continues on India as it is right now, they stand to lose about $20 billion of trade to the U.S. So this motivates and although not officially, but it does motivate them to change their tactics. We have, with this seen sanctioned barrels or we have seen sanctioned barrels increase their market share in key growth regions over the years, and this accelerated after 2022 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nBut now we're in a situation where OPEC8 voluntary production cut reversals and the supply growth, especially in Latin America, has given the market headroom to choose compliant sources of oil without affecting oil prices materially. And as global demand continues to grow, we seem to have found the limit on production and export growth from the sanctioned nations. If you look at the 2 charts on the below on the slide and look at these kind of 3 key sanctioned nations production, it seems to be tapering off. And also, if you look at their exports, it's tapering off even faster.\nThere is a fact that when these countries lose kind of knowledge and parts from the rest of the world in order to maintain their production levels, they tend to also lose productivity. If you look at the chart on the top right-hand side, year-on-year, China and India's compliance crude imports, we see a very positive development. Whether this is sustainable is obviously difficult to say, but we are at least moving in the right direction. Let's dig a little bit further into the flows on Slide 10. So on the top left-hand side here, we have year-on-year change in global crude production and also in global exports. Exports is the part that concerns tankers.\nWe've seen quite steep year-on-year changes to the positive in Q2 and also looks to come in, in Q3, and this reflects the previously mentioned increase of around 2 million barrels year-on-year in exports. This is predominantly coming from compliance sources. If you look at the chart below, we've just taken out Iranian and Russian and Venezuelan oil, and it looks very promising. If you look at the chart on the bottom right-hand side, and this is important. If you -- basically what's been missing in our market and particularly hurting Frontline has been the fact that the long-haul trade of oil has suffered.\nRussia has supplied Asia to a very large degree, whilst Europe has received resupply as they're missing the Russian barrels from U.S., Brazil, Guyana and West Africa. What we ideally want is Latin American and U.S. oil to go east. This is about double the voyage of this local transatlantic trades. But in order to get to that point, Atlantic Basin oil basically needs to price eastbound. It needs to be cheaper, including freight than the benchmark grade in the Middle East, which is called Dubai.\nWhat's happened over the last couple of weeks is with India entering the Middle East market to a larger degree now than what we used to do, they have pushed up prices in the Middle East to the point where now you can actually place U.S. barrels cheaper into the Asian market than taking it from the Middle East. Of course, it takes time for this to be reflected in rates. But what we have seen already is a significant increase in U.S. Gulf fixtures for September, which obviously is going to be October delivery than what we've seen previously. Let's move to Slide 11 and look at then the order books.\nSo basically, what I described on the previous slide, it basically equates to about 6% increase in freight demand, and that's not adjusting for ton miles. So the potential change here is greater. But the fleet is not really growing at all. In 2025, it's expected to be reduced by about 0.5% if you look at the active trading fleet that is either not sanctioned or sitting still. There are so few vessels coming into this market that we're actually experiencing negative growth. So with that equation together with longer trade lanes, more compliant oil in the market and a stable fleet development is good news as we move into the fall here.\nWe have a record amount of vessels above 20 years of age in the fleet. We have a record amount of or part of the fleet being sanctioned. And in light of that kind of setup, we continue to have a very limited order book. We also see that the activity on the yards for tankers has been fairly slow for a long period of time now, and there's only very few orders being placed. If you order a vessel today, you are 90% certain that you need to wait until 2028 to get that vessel on the water. So basically, the tanker market is sold out for 2027.\nThere will be transactions on resales for both '26 and '27 delivery, could even be '25. But if you go to -- if you want to increase the order book from here, 2028 is the year. So to try and sum up a little bit, and I have jokingly, but hopefully, it's not a joke, call this compliant bull market question mark. Basically, trade policy is affecting crude sourcing for the key demand regions, and this has been a little bit of a step change as far as we can see it over the last couple of months.\nWe see an increased utilization in the compliant fleet, and we see kind of a more healthy growth in both employment and freight as we are proceeding here. The effective tanker fleet growth remains muted, both due to the aging and -- but also, of course, due to the widening sanction reach. We have healthy refinery margins, and this is actually the first time in a while, and it's been steadily improving since November last year. We've had a seasonally strong summer market, which again kind of confirms this positive demand growth as we see it. OPEC cut reversals are expected to yield increased exports from the Middle East as we approach winter.\nAnd Frontline continue to retain its material upside with our modern but not the least spot-exposed fleet. Thank you. And with that, we'll open up for questions and give some answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Nokta with Jefferies.\nOmar Mostafa Nokta: Lars, Inger. Thank you for the update. Lars always very good as you kind of go through all the detail and all the moving parts in the market. I did want to maybe follow up just on a couple of those discussion points. Maybe you made a point on Slide 10 talking about those West to East flows and how those have been missing from the market. But here recently, there's perhaps a jump in terms of U.S. VLCC exports going to Asia.\nI guess how do you think about how that starts to play out as we get closer to winter here over the next several months where you do get an incremental amount of volume into the Middle East market from OPEC. How does that all kind of justs that dynamic overall in terms of the long haul of VLCC trade?\nLars H. Barstad: Well, of course, I should say Jefferies, but I have to actually lean on Goldman here. They and other kind of observers are modestly or even increasingly, bearish crude prices this winter, one being due to the return of the Middle East oil from OPEC. But secondly, that we are actually -- on supply side, we are about 1 million barrels per day north of the demand side. So it's a very good point. I don't want to be in the predicting or in the betting kind of part of this.\nBut I do subscribe to the idea that we could -- it's not a floating storage contango, but we could get a contango basically with -- well, I assume most of you know what the contango means that could kind of come into the oil curve this winter unless we see something very surprising on the demand side. What normally happens then on oil trade is that utilization further increases. Basically, since the future price is higher than the present price, traders and transporters of oil have no hurry to move into port to discharge. And also, it kind of -- it gives you the ability to freight oil longer.\nBut lastly, and the most important part, it also incentivizes people to build inventories. And that's been a big missing part as well. We do see reports of China building inventories, but the rest of OECD is kind of very, very low on the inventory side. So if that answers your question, this is a potential scenario we see play out as we come into winter.\nOmar Mostafa Nokta: That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up, kind of talking a bit more on the market. A big theme here over the past maybe few quarters or perhaps a couple of years is the fits and starts we've seen in the VLCC market where rates gain momentum and you think this is going to be the big shift and then they fall back and then expectations sort of get reset. Last week was a bit exciting in terms of the move in spot rates. They seem to have gapped up. And it seems maybe this week that they're holding up.\nWhat would you kind of attribute some of the -- I know it's very short-term thinking, but what would you attribute those recent gains to? Are you starting to actually see those export barrels from OPEC come to market? Or is it something else at play?\nLars H. Barstad: I think kind of what has come to motion here or gotten into the market is this shift from -- with some Russian backing up, quite a bit of Iranian backing up and that oil being replaced from the complied sources. This has kind of almost like an exponential effect on the demand for compliant tankers. So that is kind of driving it. We have this kind of magic ceiling around $50,000 per day on VLCCs, and we struggle to push through. This has something we believe with the structure of the market, we are kind of -- we are deep in the money, long-term owners of tankers. We -- for us, there shouldn't be a ceiling at all.\nBut if you are more on the short-term trading side, and you're taking a ship in on time charter for $40,000 per day, suddenly, you can kind of literally close the strategy with a $10,000 per day profit you do that because then you get the bonus next year and can buy yourself a new Chalet in Switzerland. And those guys have an awful lot of ships under the commercial control. So you could say that the owners have been a little bit diluted by such a presence in the spot market.\nWhat's encouraging right now is that I can promise you, ever since last Thursday, all the charters have been trying to push this market down as far as they could. And it seems like we are finding some support and only lost like $5,000 per day in earnings. So if this is a floor, just to put the VLCC there around $45,000 per day, then I'm actually quite optimistic that we'll be able to push through this kind of artificial ceiling at $50,000 and hopefully establish a new floor a little bit higher up.\nSo the waiting that's been happening now and all the fun and games to try and push this market down has meant that charters are actually starting to get a little bit -- little time to get the vessels they need in order to lift their cargoes. And that's always a very good news to the market. And it's going to be very interesting as we come to work next week and see what -- how this develops.\nOmar Mostafa Nokta: Okay. Yes, very good. Lars, I'll see how things indeed develop here. Appreciate it.\nLars H. Barstad: Thank you, Omar.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Lars Barstad for closing remarks.\nLars H. Barstad: Well, thank you very much. I hope it's good news that there were so a few questions at this point or if it's just Friday. But thank you very much for listening in and looking forward to see how this develops.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

In the event that any information you provide is inaccurate or not up to date, The Motley Fool reserves the right to cancel your subscription.\nWe reserve the right to refuse or discontinue the supply of a Service to any user at any time at our sole discretion.\nUnless stated otherwise, membership to any Service is for online and/or electronic access only. Certain promotions may offer features that are issued in physical form. Shipping of any goods or service associated with these promotions is limited to the U.S./APO. Physical fulfillment of goods or services not specifically mentioned in a promotion is at the sole discretion of the Fool.\nOur Services generally deliver their content via email including trade alerts or recommendations, recent actionable investing guidance, Best Buys Now, and other important stock news. There is no opt-out choice available for these emails (unless you cancel your subscription). Of course, you can always opt out of our marketing emails on the settings page.\nTrial Terms, Automatic Billing and Cancellation Policy\nSome Services may provide a free trial or introductory offer. If such an offer is provided, only one per person or household is allowed at any given point in time. In addition, there is a limit of one trial per person and household in any given six-month period unless otherwise stated in the offer.\nUpon signing up for a free trial, you will have access to the Service for the promotional trial period. If you cancel prior to the end of the promotional offer period, your credit card will not be charged. If you don't cancel your subscription within the trial offer period, we will charge the primary credit card you provided during the sign-up process. You may contact Member Support at [email protected] to terminate your trial enrollment.\nYour membership will automatically renew at the then-current rate, until you notify us of your decision to terminate your membership. Many subscriptions will renew for one-year or one-month terms, regardless of the offer under which the subscription was initiated. For subscription terms greater than three months we will email you about the length and price for your renewal before we charge you. Monthly subscription terms will be notified annually regarding future renewals. Automatic renewal term lengths are subject to change and we will email you about the length and price for your automatic renewal before we charge you. If you would like to turn off automatic renewal, or extend your subscription for additional years, please contact Member Support. BY ALLOWING FOR YOUR RENEWAL, YOU PROVIDE YOUR ELECTRONIC AUTHORIZATION FOR FUTURE CHARGES AGAINST YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE OR APPLE PAY. Accordingly, you agree that your membership fee or subscription will be billed automatically at the beginning of each renewal period at the then-current rate (plus sales tax, if applicable) to the credit card you used in your most recent transaction with us. Any subscription purchased using Apple Pay will continue to renew on Apple Pay.\nThe Motley Fool reserves the right to increase a Service's fees or institute new charges upon reasonable notice. Service fees are due in advance.\nEnrollment Fees\nFrom time-to-time, we may offer enrollment fee based products which may include an ongoing monthly fee. There is no refund offered for the enrollment fee under these terms. Based on the specific terms of the offer under which you buy the product, the fee may be refundable or eligible for a credit transfer. Please see full offer terms for your product or service for more details.\nRefunds\nDifferent Services (and sometimes specific offers) have different refund policies (including some that offer no refunds, or some that offer different pricing depending on availability of refunds). Please review the specific terms of your offer before signing up as you are agreeing to be bound those terms. If you are unsure of your cancellation rights, please contact Member Support.\nPlease note that most refunds are only available to first-time subscribers. If you subscribe to a Service that allows for refunds beyond 30 days, and cancel (and receive a refund) and then subscribe again, you will not receive a refund after the first 30 days.\nFrom time to time, The Motley Fool offers its premium services through third-party vendors. In such cases, the vendor\u2019s refund policy would apply and may differ from your Service (or specific offer).\nTransfer; Discontinuing a Service\nYou cannot transfer your subscription to someone else, except through bequeathment or by a court order. In the event a subscription is transferred, it will continue through the end of its term and can be renewed at the then-current price and conditions. For assistance in this situation, please contact Member Services.\nIn the event that we discontinue a Service, you agree that The Motley Fool may transfer your subscription to another Service of equal or greater value.\n3. Credits, Transfer Credits, and Bonus Credits Information\nSome of our services provide the option to transfer some or all of the purchase price towards a different Motley Fool service, (a \u201cTransfer Credit(s)\u201d). Depending on the terms of your purchase, you may be allowed to transfer the full or pro-rated credit from your purchase into a Transfer Credit. Most services eligible for a Transfer Credit will allow an exchange for a different service using the Transfer Credit within 30 days of the initial purchase, and there are services that do not allow for credits of any kind.\nIf you are unsure whether or not your service is eligible for a Transfer Credit please contact [email protected].\nIf you take advantage of a Transfer Credit guarantee, please also note that you will lose access to any product(s) and benefits included in the original promotional offer, including additional services or reports that may have been included as a bonus or incentive for taking advantage of the offer.\nIf the list price of the service you would like to transfer into is more than the amount of Transfer Credits you have, you will receive a partial term of the service. If the list price of the service you would like to transfer into is less than the amount of Transfer Credits, you will be given a service extension such that all Transfer Credits are consumed. In both cases the usual automatic renewal notice will be emailed a month prior to the adjusted end-date.\nWhen using a Transfer Credit, the term length of the service being transferred into cannot extend beyond three years. In the event your Transfer Credit would result in a service term greater than three years, your subscription will be extended to three years and the remaining Transfer Credits will immediately expire.\nSome purchases may include a temporary bonus credit (the \u201cBonus Credit\u201d) that can be applied to a future purchase. These Bonus Credits are valid for 30 days from the date of purchase, and multiple Bonus Credits may be combined for a single purchase. If any Bonus Credits is used on a purchase, the remaining value of all active Bonus Credits immediately expires. Bonus Credits may not be used to early renew a service or extend an existing subscription.\nTransfer and Bonus Credits may be combined for a single purchase. In the event they are combined, the combined credit may only be used for a single purchase, after which all Transfer and Bonus Credits will immediately expire.\nProducts obtained using Transfer Credits and Bonus Credits must be obtained at the list price of the product being transferred into, and cannot be combined with any promotional offers or discounts. Products and services obtained using Transfer or Bonus Credits of any kind are not eligible for exchange, refund, swaps, or any other action that would result in the creation of any Bonus Credits.\nThe Motley Fool reserves the right to disallow Transfer Credits, discounts, or Bonus Credits into certain services depending on insufficient credit, product openings, investment timelines, a member's history of transfers or prior refunds, or for any other reason at The Motley Fool\u2019s sole discretion.\nAt certain times we may offer subscriptions or upgrades to services that may contain components of other services you might currently subscribe to. These offers may include prorated Transfer Credit value for your existing subscriptions. If you purchase one of these subscriptions or upgrades the prorated Transfer Credit value from any existing subscription(s) on your account will be used in its entirety towards the purchase, and the prior-existing subscription will be cancelled upon purchase of the new subscription.\n4. Affiliate Marketing Programs\nSome of our brands such as Motley Fool Money, review various products and services. We may be compensated by third parties whose products we review. This compensation may impact where reviews and offers appear, with higher paying partners appearing higher on a page or in a more prominent position. None of our brands can or does promise to be comprehensive with their reviews of any particular marketplace, and the companies covered may heavily tilt towards partners.\nThat being said, we take try to make sure that our editorial opinions are not affected by our compensation, and no partner or advertiser will review, edit, endorse, or approve editorial content. We also make sure that the editorial teams of any brand remains distinct from the editorial team writing content for Fool.com or our premium services.\nNo reviews of products or services should be construed as an endorsement or guarantee of any kind. We do the best we can to make sure that the information we rely upon for our reviews is true and current, but we cannot and will not warranty that it actually is, or that we have not been confused or misled before or after publication.\nAny service or product not offered by The Motley Fool is subject to its own terms and conditions, including about how they may use the information you provide to them, which should be provided by the company through which you are receiving the product or service, and any use of a product or service not offered by The Motley Fool is done so at your own risk.\n5. Additional and Third-Party Terms of Use\nPlease note that certain individual Services or products may have their own, or additional, terms and conditions. In the event of a conflict, the terms for the individual Service will control with respect to the Service in question. So please be sure to review any additional terms and conditions with respect to any specific Service before subscribing.\nSome portions of our site use Google Maps APIs, or other Google APIs. If you use those parts of our site, you are also bound by the Google Terms of Service. If you do not wish to be bound by these terms, or any of the terms contained within these Rules, please do not use our site.\n6. CAPS\nCAPS is The Motley Fool's service that allows you to make predictions about stocks, see others' predictions, aggregate community opinions, and track their accuracy. By putting together lots of information from a variety of sources, we hope to provide participants with a way to a) have fun and b) learn to make better investment decisions.\nYou should not assume that the opinions that people express in CAPS are the opinions of The Motley Fool or anything other than the opinions of the individuals expressing them.\nWhen you look at other people's predictions, you should remember that those people may have interests in the stocks that they're making predictions about. For example, some people may hope a company's stock will go up because they own many shares of it; others may hope that it will rise because they (or their sister) work for the company; others may hope that the stock will rise because that will increase their CAPS score and their international prestige. When you review people's predictions (or the stock tips you see on television or hear in the supermarket), you should not assume that the person making a prediction is unbiased or independent. One of the beauties of CAPS, though, is that you can see the performance of people's predictions over time and, we hope, distinguish sound analysis from self-serving nonsense.\nMotley Fool employees may participate in CAPS and they may have interests in the stocks about which they make predictions. Employees display their positions in their online TMF profiles at Fool.com. Any predictions made by Fool employees are their own. They are not speaking on behalf of our company and these predictions are not Motley Fool recommendations.\n7. Intellectual Property\nAll of the Content on our websites and any Service we provide is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws and is the property of The Motley Fool and/or providers of the content under license. By \"Content\" we mean any information, mode of expression, or other materials and services found on The Motley Fool. This includes message boards, blogs, CAPS picks, ratings, podcasts, chats, software, our writings, graphics, videos, and any and all other features. You can find out more information on copyright law and the Internet at www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html.\nYou may make one copy of the Content for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that any material copied remains intact and includes the following notice: \"Copyright 1995-2018 [or whatever the current year is] The Motley Fool. All rights reserved.\" Any other copying, distribution, storing, or transmission of any kind, or any commercial use of our Content, is prohibited without The Fool's prior written permission. That means you may not sell, auction, transfer or barter your subscription or any individual publication. You can make or end your own CAPS picks at any time, but those picks, their scoring history, your scoring history, and data aggregated by CAPS remain the property of The Motley Fool.\nYou also may not republish, post, transmit, or distribute the Content to online bulletin and message boards, blogs, chat rooms, intranets, or anywhere else without our consent. You further agree not to create abstracts from or scrape our Content, including CAPS ratings, for use on another website or service (including our own personal forums and blogs). In short, you may not post our Content anywhere else online. Aside from opening yourself up to liability, distributing our premium Services, stock picks, and performance data to other sites and forums is unfair to our members who pay good money to receive our Content. So please don't do it.\nPlease note that notwithstanding the foregoing, when you post content (such as a message-board post or CAPS pitch), you are not somehow surrendering your copyright in your expression, but you are granting us an unlimited license to use it. Specifically, by posting content, you agree that The Motley Fool has an irrevocable, perpetual, and worldwide license to use republish, distribute, reproduce, display, communicate to the public, adapt, perform, store, translate, sublicense, and promote anything you post on our websites. This includes the rights to syndicate and make derivative works out of your content. If you don't want us to use or republish your content, then please don't post it on our websites. We'll only republish your content in context, and we'll credit you as author (unless we're using small quotations). We won't republish your posts in advertising without your permission. And we promise not to mock you unless it would amuse us.\nWe also ask that you only upload or include on our Services materials you have the right to use. While we don\u2019t mind if Peter Parker posts photos he\u2019s taken on our platform, we do ask that he not repost images he\u2019s already sold or licensed to The Daily Bugle. If you have a good faith belief that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify our Copyright Agent.\nYou agree not to display any of The Motley Fool's trademarks or use them in any manner without our express written permission. You can find the list of our trademarks here.\nSome features of our site are patented under U.S. Patent No. 7,813,986 and U.S. Patent No. 7,882,006.\n8. Conduct\nThe Motley Fool champions active and open debate among our members. All we ask is that it's done in a lawful and civil manner -- be it posting on our boards, commenting on blogs or articles, replying to CAPS pitches, or using our system to contact a fellow member in any way.\nAccordingly, you agree to use The Motley Fool for lawful purposes only. You may not use or allow others to use your Fool membership to:\n- Post or transmit any content that is disruptive, uncivil, abusive, vulgar, profane, obscene, hateful, fraudulent, threatening, harassing, defamatory, or which discloses private or personal matters concerning any person;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any material that you don't have the right to transmit under law (such as copyrights, trade secrets, or securities) or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as nondisclosure agreements);\n\u2022 Post, transmit, or link to sexually explicit material;\n\u2022 Impersonate any person, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any advertising, promotional materials, or other forms of solicitation, including chain letters and pyramid schemes;\n\u2022 Violate any applicable law or regulation while accessing and using our sites, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the national or other securities exchanges (especially and including the rule against making false or misleading statements to manipulate the price of any security);\n\u2022 Offer, sell, or buy any security;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any file that contains viruses, corrupted files, \"Trojan Horses,\" or any other contaminating or destructive features that may damage someone's computer;\n\u2022 Forge headers or manipulate identifiers or other data in order to disguise the origin of any content transmitted through our sites or to manipulate your presence on our sites;\n\u2022 Use any automated means, including, without limitation, agents, robots, scripts, or spiders, to access, monitor, copy or harvest data from any part of our sites;\n\u2022 Take any action that imposes an unreasonably or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services; and\n\u2022 Take any action that damages or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services.\nUnauthorized access of our sites is a breach of these Terms and Conditions and a violation of the law. You agree not to access our sites by any means other than through the interfaces we provide for use in our accessing our sites.\nThe Motley Fool may at any time, without prior notice and at our sole discretion, remove any post, terminate any membership, remove any individual CAPS picks, delete any CAPS players, remove any CAPS scorecards, or take any action for violating the above (and, if we may say so, sensible) provisions or otherwise taking an action disruptive to a Service. In the event TMF terminates your premium Service, you will receive a prorated refund at our discretion.\nYou are responsible for statements made and actions taken through the use of your password, so please maintain the confidentiality of your password. You agree to immediately notify Member Support of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your username and password. We will not be responsible for any loss to you arising from unauthorized use of your data. For more information on posting, please see our Posting Guidelines.\nIf you see something that you feel is a violation of the Fool's Rules, please notify us by emailing [email protected].\n9. No Personalized Advice\nWe want to help you make money. However, The Motley Fool is not in the business of rendering personalized investment advice. We can't know all the relevant facts about you and your individual needs, and we cannot claim or represent that any particular Services are suitable for you. Accordingly, you agree that any recommendation or action taken by a Service does not constitute a recommendation that a particular security, strategy, or action is suitable for you. If you want personal advice, then you should seek a registered investment advisor.\nThe Motley Fool may partner with third parties in order to make buying our Services' recommendations easier for you. We will not, and cannot, trade on your behalf at your brokerage. Only you can decide whether or not a stock is right for you and you agree to be liable for any trades you initiate at your brokerage using tools that we or our partners provide.\nAffiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no nonpublic knowledge of our affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates\u2019 personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published.\n10. You Bear Responsibility for Your Financial and Investment Decisions\nOne of the principal tenets here at the Fool is that the best person to handle your finances is you. By your use of our Services, you're agreeing that you bear responsibility for your own investment research and investment decisions. You also agree that The Motley Fool, its directors, its employees, and its agents will not be liable for any investment decision made or action taken by you and others based on news, information, opinion, or any other material published through our Services.\n11. Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities\nPlease read The Motley Fool's Disclaimer, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Motley Fool provides a very broad range of information and commentary via its many Services. Consequently, as a result of the diverse opinions of our staff, a Fool Service may, from time to time, take actions or issue recommendations with regard to specific securities that are different from those taken or issued by another Service we provide.\nThe Motley Fool does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the Content found in our Services or its usefulness for any particular purpose. And although we have the hardest-working, most talented techies in the business, The Motley Fool makes no promises that our content or any of the Services will be delivered to you on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis. In fact, we're not making any promises or warranties except that we'll do our best to provide interesting and helpful information, education, and entertainment. Other than that, we reserve the right to be wrong, stupid, or even foolish (with a small \"f\").\nNow what does all this mean? It means that you agree that under no circumstances will The Motley Fool, its employees, or its agents be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or any other type of damages resulting from your use, purchase, or downloading of any material on our Websites, or arising from or related to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is no way limited to, loss or injury caused in whole or in part by our negligence or by stuff beyond our control in creating or delivering any of our Services. This disclaimer of liability does not apply in New Jersey.\nThe Fool relies on various sources of information that we believe to be accurate and reliable. There are also literally thousands of contributors here -- most, we believe, with incredibly interesting and insightful information and opinions to share. But we can't and won't take responsibility for, or make any claims or representations about, the accuracy, completeness, or even the truth of every bit of data, information, and opinion provided through our Services. Remember: All information and content provided on or by The Motley Fool is to be used on an \"as is, with all faults, we're not perfect\" basis.\nObligatory Capitalized Disclaimers of Liability:\nEXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE WEBSITE AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTAINED AND OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND ON AN \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS. NEITHER THE MOTLEY FOOL NOR ANY OF OUR PARTNERS MAKES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL THAT YOU PURCHASE OR OBTAIN FROM THE USE OF OUR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR THAT AND ANY ERRORS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED. NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR PARTNERS MAKES ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO OUR WEBSITES, ANY CONTENT, OR ANY OF OUR SERVICES, TOOLS, PRODUCTS, OR PROPERTIES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOU WILL ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THEIR CONTENT.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY AND THAT OF OUR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES DOES NOT APPLY IN NEW JERSEY.\nThat was tiresome, but important.\n12. Communication\nFederal or state law may require that we notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our websites or sending them to you via email (another reason to please keep your account settings current). If you do not provide us with accurate information, we cannot be held liable if we fail to notify you. You may request that we provide such notices to you in paper format by writing to General Counsel, The Motley Fool, LLC, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314.\n13. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver\nIf a dispute arises in connection with your use of our Services or in relation to any of these Terms (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) our hope is that we can resolve the matter informally. Accordingly, in the event of a Dispute, we agree to first contact each other via email with a description of the Dispute and any proposed resolution. You will email [email protected] with your concern and The Motley Fool will contact you via the email address we have on file for you.\nIf a Dispute cannot be resolved informally, we each agree that except as provided below, the Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in a location convenient to you. Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA\u2019s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. We will pay all of the filing costs, including arbitrator fees. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.\nEXCEPTIONS\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the state and federal courts of Virginia: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim related to or contesting the validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, or trade secrets; or (ii) an action by a party for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief. You may also file an individual action in a small claims court in lieu of arbitration.\nOPTING OUT\nYou will have thirty (30) days from the date you submit your personally identifiable information to opt out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration, you must contact us at The Motley Fool, LLC, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314, Attention: Legal Department. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.\n14. Your Agreement to These Terms\nYou acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms electronically you are expressly agreeing to the terms set forth herein. You acknowledge that your electronic submission constitutes your agreement and intent to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.\n15. Everything Else\nIf any provision in these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or nonsensical, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. This agreement is and always will be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia (except with respect to choice of law).You agree that the proper forum for any claim arising thereunder will be the U.S. Court for the Eastern District of Virginia or the appropriate Virginia court.\nOur Services are directed at a U.S. audience. We cannot warrant that the Services are appropriate for users outside the United States or that use of the Services is permitted under the laws of other jurisdictions. All personal data is maintained in the United States under the terms of our Privacy Policy, which is also incorporated by reference.\nExcept as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms and Conditions, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.\nThese Terms and Conditions, including those that are incorporated by reference, constitute the entire and only agreement between you and The Motley Fool and govern your use of our sites.\nLast Updated: November 17th, 2024\nhttps://www.fool.com/legal/stuff-we-own/"

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo!

      "text": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Just Launched A Potential $1.5 Trillion Opportunity\nNVIDIA is about to be \u201cMade in America.\u201d\nDo you know which stock we\u2019re talking about?\nDon\u2019t wait to find out.\nSimply click below to sign up and learn about this investment opportunity.\nThen act fast!\nSimply click below to sign up and learn more about this investment opportunity.\nThank you. You will be redirected momentarily\u2026\nFollowing a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape.\nIt\u2019s already being measured in trillions, and what we\u2019re witnessing could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s tech infrastructure.\nBest of all: Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner is predicting there will be one stock that could be a clear winner.\nConsider this\u2026\nEarlier this year NVIDIA announced something unbelievably bold.\nEvery supercomputer would be built entirely in the USA - for the first time ever.\nThe total investment in America: $500 billion over four years.\nThat number should already have investors drooling with anticipation, but if you\u2019ve been paying attention, the story gets even better\u2026\nThat\u2019s because NVIDIA\u2019s announcement - while historic on its own - is just one of many dominoes we expect to fall in the near future.\n- Apple is furiously working to move production out of China, and recently announced $500 billion invested in the USA over the next four years.\n- And ChatGPT-creator OpenAI recently unveiled its \u2018Stargate\u2019 project that aims to invest $500 billion entirely in the United States in the next four years.\nAdd that up and it's already at $1.5 trillion.\nKeep in mind, NVIDIA was the first to act, announcing a bold $500 billion commitment to U.S. expansion almost immediately after the policy shift.\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen a growing wave of companies following in NVIDIA\u2019s gigantic footsteps\u2026 and all signs point to more on the way.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is something that could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s dominant technology companies.\nAll announced in what could be as short as a 90-day window. America\u2019s high-tech is now \u2018Made in the USA.\u2019\nHere\u2019s the best part: every media headline is focused on how bad tariffs are\u2026. And certainly, many companies will be losers.\nOnce again, we believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime shift happening rapidly before our eyes\u2026\nYet, almost no one is focusing on the fact that this multi-trillion dollar reshoring could mean potential MASSIVE gains for a small group of companies.\nThink of the companies that need to build trillions of dollars of factories, data centers, and other technology flooding back into America.\nLegendary investor and Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner just identified a small - less than 1/100th the size of NVIDIA - American company (headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut!) that does exactly this.\nIt specializes in the construction of massive technology projects and could soon become the \u2018story stock\u2019 of the potential Made in the USA boom.\nSo while some investors are content to sit and watch their net worth whittle away as tariff story after tariff story hits the news\u2026.\nWe believe we\u2019ve found something completely different.\nA stock that could become the next big winner of this possibly Made in the USA boom.\nBut \u2026. Tick, tick, tick\u2026 The clock is winding down. If you want to get invested before the next wave of technology companies announces their own Made in the USA plans\u2026\nYou need to consider acting now.

  "argos_summary": "Frontline reported Q2 2025 adjusted profit of $80.4\u202fmillion, driven by a $40\u202fmillion jump in TCE earnings and higher VLCC, Suezmax, and LR2 rates. The company\u2019s fleet remains fully ECO\u2011compliant, with 82% of VLCC days booked at $38,700/day and strong liquidity of $844\u202fmillion, but an order book that is effectively sold out through 2027. Management highlighted rising utilization of compliant tankers amid OPEC production reversals and increased US Gulf exports to Asia, suggesting a potential lift in freight demand. Despite a negative effective fleet growth of 0.5% in 2025, Frontline maintains solid cash\u2011generation potential, with a 30% spot\u2011market bump projected to boost annual cash flow by 64%.",
