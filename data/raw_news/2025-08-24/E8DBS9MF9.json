She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work has appeared in Brides, Parents, What To Expect, Romper, and The Knot. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on July 31, 2025 05:56PM EDT Leave a Comment Sharon Osbourne, Ozzy Osbourne, Jack Osbourne, Aree Gearhart and Jack's daughters, Pearl, Andy, and Minnie. Credit : Jack Osbourne Instagram As the father of four daughters, Jack Osbourne has his hands full. Osbourne shares three kids \u2014 Pearl, Andy and Minnie \u2014 with his ex-wife Lisa Stelly. In 2013, Stelly was also pregnant with the couple's baby boy, Theo, though she had a late-term miscarriage in her second trimester. After Osbourne and Stelly finalized their divorce in 2019, Osbourne started dating his now-wife Aree Gearhart. Osbourne and Gearhart got engaged in December 2021 and welcomed their first baby, Maple, the following July. In a 2018 interview with PEOPLE, Osbourne touched on co-parenting with his ex-wife, saying he and Lisa were \u201cdoing really well\u201d with it. \u201cIt\u2019s all you can really ask for at this stage. It\u2019s great,\" he said. Osbourne also spoke about how his parenting style differs from that of his parents, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. \u201cI\u2019m a little more structured with my kids than my parents were with me,\u201d he explained. \u201cI won\u2019t take them out of school just to go travel. We do a little bit, but I think structure is healthy.\u201d His parents have remained active in his children's lives, and after Ozzy's death in July 2025, his grandchildren were there to say goodbye at his funeral procession in Birmingham, England. Here\u2019s everything to know about Jack Osbourne\u2019s daughters. Pearl Clementine Osbourne, 13 Sharon Osbourne and Pearl Osbourne. Jack Osbourne Instagram Osbourne's oldest daughter, Pearl Clementine Osbourne, was born on April 24, 2012. When she arrived, her grandmother, Sharon, wrote on X, \u201cToday I witnessed my first grandchild being born, life changing experience. She is an angel.\u201d Pearl was born only three weeks after Osbourne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). \u201cThere\u2019s this weird association with my life before [being a] parent and then my life before MS,\u201d he told PEOPLE in a 2016 interview. Osbourne also talked about how Pearl was already \u201cpushing the limits\u201d at just 4 \u00bd-years-old. \u201cShe\u2019s understanding what defiance is, and if she digs her heels in she might actually get her way and what she wants to do versus [listening] to her mother and [me],\u201d he said. Pearl made a few cameos on her father and grandfather's History Channel series, Ozzy & Jack\u2019s World Detour, when she was younger. One appearance happened in the episode \u201cPearls of Wisdom,\u201d when the father and son took Pearl on a camping trip. Aree Gearhart, Jack Osbourne, and Pearl Osbourne. Jack Osbourne Instagram In a 2016 interview with PEOPLE, Osbourne opened up about Pearl\u2019s love of nature, saying, \u201cShe loves the outdoors, so she takes after me a little bit. I take her camping as much as I can and take her outdoors.\u201d He also said that Pearl loves \u201cbeing scared\u201d and is a big fan of Halloween. Osbourne explained she had recently discovered Nightmare Before Christmas and loved talking about and watching Jack Skellington and Mr. Oogie Boogie. It also seems like Pearl is a loving older sister. In a 2017 interview with PEOPLE, Stelly said, \u201cPearl\u2019s the greatest big sister ever. She\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Pearl appears to love spending time with her family, as her mom and dad are frequently posting photos of her with them and other family members on social media. In March 2023, Osbourne shared a since-deleted photo of Pearl and her grandma hugging, and way back in 2013, he posted one of Pearl making her grandpa laugh. Andy Rose Osbourne, 10 Jack Osbourne and Andy Osbourne. Jack Osbourne Instagram Osbourne's second daughter with Stelly, Andy Rose Osbourne, was born on June 13, 2015. Osbourne has called Andy \u201ca very unique individual,\u201d saying she gave him a bit of a tough time when she was a toddler. During a 2021 interview on The Tamron Hall Show, Osbourne talked about what made her different, saying that when she was nearly 3 years old, she decided she \u201cjust didn\u2019t want to wear clothes anymore.\u201d \u201cSo it started with no shoes and then no socks, and then no pants or skirts or dresses, and then no T-shirt and then she decided that diapers were fire,\u201d he said. Andy Osbourne. Jack Osbourne Instagram However, she quickly grew out of that phase. In a 2018 interview with PEOPLE, Osbourne said that Andy would only wear big gowns all day long. \u201cLike she\u2019s going to a quinceanera every day,\u201d he joked. He also said his daughters are \u201cthe most girly girls imaginable\u201d and that he\u2019s always surrounded by unicorns and rainbows. In September 2023, Andy started third grade. Osbourne shared photos of her first day of school on Instagram, writing, \"First Day of School! Maple with the big send off for Andy & Minnie.\" Minnie Theodora Osbourne, 7 Minnie Osbourne. Lisa Stelly Instagram Osbourne and Stelly\u2019s youngest daughter, Minnie Theodora Osbourne, was born on Feb. 3, 2018. Osbourne announced her birth with a photo on Instagram, writing, \u201cShe\u2019s the newest member of my girl squad,\u201d in the caption. Minnie's middle name, Theodora, is likely a nod to Osbourne and Stelly's late son Theo, whom they lost in 2013 during Stelly's second trimester. On Minnie\u2019s first birthday, Osbourne shared a sweet photo of her eating cake and a sentimental message. \u201cMy little ray of light turned one on Sunday,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cShe\u2019s such a blessing and it [has] been so much fun getting to know her over the last year. She\u2019s sweet and playful and loves her big sisters so much.\" Kelly Osbourne and Minnie Osbourne. Jack Osbourne Instagram Osbourne continued, \"I can\u2019t wait to see what magic will come from her as she circles the sun for another time. Minnie I love you with all my heart.\u201d Now, Minnie seemingly has a close relationship with her aunt Kelly Osbourne. In June 2023, Osbourne shared a sweet snap of his daughter enjoying a playdate with his sister, Kelly. In the photo, Minnie sat on Kelly's lap as someone applied pink eyeshadow onto her eyelids. \u201cMinnie having a play date with Auntie,\u201d Jack captioned the post. Maple Artemis Osbourne, 3 Jack Osbourne and Maple Osbourne. Jack Osbourne Instagram Osbourne's fourth daughter \u2014 and first with now-wife Gearhart \u2014 Maple Artemis Osbourne was born on July 9, 2022. She arrived only a few months after Osbourne and Gearhart got engaged. He announced that Gearhart was pregnant with a sweet photo of himself resting his hand on Gearhart\u2019s belly. He posted the photo on Instagram with the caption, \u201cExciting news!!! @seecreature and I are expecting a baby in the summer! Baby #4 here we come!\u201d The couple made the announcement on Gearhart\u2019s birthday, and in her own Instagram post, she wrote, \u201cToday is my birthday, but my gift doesn\u2019t arrive till summer ;-) new member of our tribe coming summer 2022.\u201d After Maple was born, the new parents shared the happy news on their social media pages. Osbourne posted an adorable photo of Maple in a fuzzy bodysuit with bear ears and wrote, \u201cAree and Maple are doing great and are happy and healthy.\u201d Proud grandma Sharon posted the same photo and wrote, \u201cMaple Artemis Osbourne.

Jack Osbourne Instagram While she is still just a baby, she has an unmistakable resemblance to Osbourne. In a since-deleted photo the proud dad shared on Instagram, the two looked almost identical while making the same face. Gearthart posts a lot of photos of Maple spending time outside, too, like one captioned \u201cfirst hike\u201d where she\u2019s wearing Maple in a baby carrier. In another cute photo of the two of them outside, she once called Maple \u201cmy little tiny.\u201d Just two months after Maple's first birthday, her parents tied the knot. The couple revealed on Instagram in September 2023 that they had \"snuck away\" to say \"I do.\" \"Something really cool happened,\" Osbourne captioned a photo from their wedding day. \"I married the most amazing women I\u2019ve ever met.

Sharon Osbourne and Ozzy Osbourne welcomed their older daughter, Aimee, in 1983. But fans didn't see her on their hit MTV reality series, The Osbournes, as she moved out of the home when she was 16 years old. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t live in our house because we were filming and it drove her insane,\u201d Sharon revealed during a June 2018 episode of The Talk. \u201cShe felt too that she didn't want to grow up on camera. She hated the idea. It was appalling to her.\u201d Aimee, whose younger siblings are Jack Osbourne and Kelly Osbourne, echoed those sentiments in a September 2015 interview with The Independent, saying, \u201cBack then, I still felt I was trying to figure out who I was in the chaos of family life, so why on earth would I want that portrayed on television?\" Although she opted out of reality TV stardom, Aimee shares her late father\u2019s love of music. She's been releasing songs under the name ARO since 2015. In July 2025, Aimee made a rare public appearance at Ozzy's funeral. Here\u2019s everything to know about Ozzy Osbourne and Sharon Osbourne\u2019s eldest daughter, Aimee Osbourne, and her relationship with the reality TV stars. She was born in London Ozzy Osbourne with his wife Sharon and their children Aimee, Kelly and Jack in 1987. Dave Hogan/Hulton Archive/Getty Aimee Rachel Osbourne was born in London on Sept. 2, 1983. Like the rest of her family, she grew up both in the English countryside and in California. She told The Independent that their home life was always a little wild, and described herself as \u201cthe one that had to be in control a lot of the time.\u201d \"We travelled a lot, went on tour with my dad a lot,\u201d Aimee said. \u201cBut there was never a moment when any of us didn't feel loved, or taken care of.\" She left home when she was 16 Sharon Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, Ozzy Osbourne, Aimee Osbourne and Jack Osbourne attend 42nd Annual Grammy Awards on February 23, 2000 in Los Angeles, California.

I always really valued my privacy within that family,\" she said during an August 2020 interview on Q1043 New York. Aimee added that she wanted to give herself \u201ca chance to actually develop into a human being as opposed to just being remembered for being a teenager\u201d on TV. She continued, \u201cIt didn't really line up with what I saw my future as.\" During a 2018 episode of The Talk, Sharon revealed how difficult that time was, saying that she regretted \u201cevery day\u201d that her daughter left home. She\u2019s the lead singer of ARO Aimee Osbourne poses for a photo in August 2023. Aimee Osbourne/Instagram Like her father, Aimee is also a musician. She has been releasing music under the name ARO (her initials) since 2015. However, Aimee previously didn't tell anyone that she liked music, as she didn't want to be compared to Ozzy. \u201cI kept it to myself \u2018cause you never want it known that you want to do what your parents do,\u201d she said in a January 2021 interview with Cleveland.com. Her first single, \u201cRaining Gold,\u201d was inspired by growing up in the spotlight. \"I wanted the song to touch on how overwhelming and isolating it feels to be constantly misunderstood and the importance of choosing to break free from that and just believing in yourself,\" the singer said in a March 2015 interview with Rolling Stone. \"It's so valuable to always try and put yourself in someone else's shoes. I hope this song reminds people of that.\" Related Stories Ozzy Osbourne and Sharon Osbourne's Relationship Timeline Ozzy Osbourne's Life and Career in Photos Aimee released her debut album, Vacare Adamar\u00e9, in 2020. In addition to her music, she also played Raquelle in MTV\u2019s 2003 musical adaptation of Wuthering Heights. She told reporters at the time that she didn\u2019t have \u201chuge intentions\u201d to be an actress and was \u201ccasually asked\" to be in the production. \"It was a great experience and I\u2019m glad I did it,\" she added.

We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\" Weeks before his death, Osbourne performed from a throne at the Black Sabbath farewell concert on July 5 in Birmingham. In January 2020, Osbourne revealed that he\u2019d been diagnosed in 2003 with Parkinson\u2019s disease, a nervous system disorder that affects movement. At the time, he said, \"It's not a death sentence.\" Despite numerous health challenges over the years, In February 2025, Osbourne announced a farewell fund-raising Black Sabbath concert in his hometown of Birmingham, England, set for July. It would be his final concert and his first in 20 years with the band that made him a star. Ozzy Osbourne at a SiriusXM event in 2022. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty By that time, the rocker was unable to walk due to Parkinson's. In a February interview, per The Sun, his wife Sharon Osbourne said, \u201cHe\u2019s very happy to be coming back and very emotional about this. Parkinson\u2019s is a progressive disease. It\u2019s not something you can stabilize. It affects different parts of the body, and it\u2019s affected his legs. But his voice is as good as it's ever been.\" Osbourne himself elaborated on his condition on his SiriusXM radio show, saying, \u201cI have made it to 2025. I can\u2019t walk, but you know what I was thinking over the holidays? For all my complaining, I\u2019m still alive. I may be moaning that I can\u2019t walk, but I look down the road, and there\u2019s people that didn\u2019t do half as much as me and didn\u2019t make it.\u201d In 2019, Osbourne had been diagnosed with pneumonia and suffered a fall in his Los Angeles home that required neck surgery. \"It's been terribly challenging for us all, he said of those health setbacks. In June 2022, he underwent a significant surgery \u2014 which Sharon said would \"determine the rest of his life\" during an episode of The Talk UK a week prior. He later told The Observer that the operation was to remove two metal plates that had been screwed into his spine in an earlier surgery.

Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic He returned to the stage in August 2022 for a performance in front of 30,000 at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. The following month, he spoke to PEOPLE about wanting to continue playing live despite his health issues. \"That's the only thing that reminds me I'm getting older: things going wrong and not working anymore,\" Osbourne said at the time. \"But I still feel young at heart.\" In March 2023, he canceled a string of then-upcoming U.K. and European tour dates, writing on Instagram, \"My singing voice is fine. However, after three operations, stem cell treatments, endless physical therapy sessions, and most recently, groundbreaking Cybernics (HAL) Treatment, my body is still physically weak.\" After expressing that he never would've \"imagined that my touring days would have ended this way,\" Osbourne clarified his comments in an interview with Billy Morrison on SiriusXM's Ozzy's Boneyard show later that month. Ozzy Osbourne in 2020. Kevin Winter/Getty \"If I can ever get back to where I can tour again, fine,\" he told the outlet. \"But right now, if you said to me, 'Can you go on the road in a month?' I couldn't say yes. I mean, if I could tour, I'd tour. But right now, I can't book tours because right now, I don't think I could pull them off.\" That July, Osbourne canceled a performance at Power Trip festival in Indio, Calif., that was set for October 2023. \"My original plan was to return to the stage in the summer of 2024, and when the offer to do this show came in, I optimistically moved forward,\" he wrote on Instagram at the time. \"Unfortunately, my body is telling me that I\u2019m just not ready yet and I am much too proud to have the first show that I do in nearly five years be half-assed,\" he continued. Born John Michael Osbourne in Birmingham, England, on Dec. 3, 1948, Osbourne rose to fame as the frontman of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, formed in 1968 along with members Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward.

GAB Archive/Redferns Some of the group\u2019s songs, including \u201cParanoid,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cWar Pigs,\u201d became staples in the genre they helped define. In 1978, Osbourne launched a solo career that proved equally successful, thanks to his unique vocals, singular aesthetic and antics like the infamous onstage moment in 1982 when he bit the head off a bat (which may or may not have been alive, depending on which version of the story you believe). The singer continued to deliver hits, including \u201cCrazy Train,\u201d \u201cNo More Tears\u201d and \"If I Close My Eyes Forever,\" a 1988 duet with Lita Ford that became his only Top 10 hit on Billboard's Hot 100. He was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys in 2019, and he holds a total of five wins and 12 nominations. Reflecting on his storied career, the eccentric musician told The Guardian in 2007 that his life had been an \u201cincredible adventure.\u201d \u201cThis has all been such an amazing journey for me,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI can vividly remember sitting on the step of my house in Aston, just tripping about what it would be like to be a Beatle.

On the reality show, cameras followed the rocker, his wife and two of their kids, Kelly and Jack, for what proved to be a hilarious and emotional entertainment to viewers who still expressed interest in a reboot nearly two decades later. (Their eldest daughter, Aimee, did not appear on the show; Osbourne had three other children from the first of his three marriages). \u201cThe first season was such a magical time in my family\u2019s life because we had no idea what we were doing. We had no idea that the show would be so successful,\u201d Kelly told PeopleTV\u2019s Reality Check in 2019. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how people would perceive us or anything.\" Added Kelly of the series, which ran four seasons, ending in 2005: \u201cI think that is the most raw and vulnerable you will see any family on TV. And then it all kind of was like an explosion of too much reality for us.\u201d From left: Ozzy Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, Jack Osbourne and Sharon Osbourne in 2022.

You go up, you go down, you make mistakes,\u201d he said on a 2017 episode of The Talk, which Sharon co-hosted at the time, adding, \"I\u2019ve learned a lot this year.\u201d Added Sharon at the time: \u201c35 years with someone is a hell of a long time. And I think I fell out of love with my husband and then fell back again. \u2026 I just had a newfound love, and I respected him because he\u2019s seriously trying to be a better person.\u201d Osbourne is survived by his wife and children.

People Editorial Guidelines Updated on July 30, 2025 02:22PM EDT 13 Comments Ozzy Osbourne wasn't just a heavy metal icon \u2014 he was also a father to six children. The rocker, who died on July 22 at 76 years old, welcomed two children \u2014 Louis and Jessica \u2014 with his ex-wife Thelma Riley. He also adopted her son, Elliot, from a previous relationship. After the two split, he married television personality Sharon Osbourne in 1982 and went on to welcome three more children: Aimee, Kelly and Jack. While his older children stayed out of the spotlight, Ozzy and Sharon, along with then-teenagers Kelly and Jack, appeared on the MTV show The Osbournes for four seasons from 2002 to 2005. Aimee, the couple's oldest child, chose not to be involved in the series. Since the show ended, both Kelly and Jack have found successful careers in media and started families of their own, while Aimee is the frontwoman for her band ARO. The punk rock family may be a bit unconventional, but their love for each other is strong. \"I've never said anything I've done is right. Like every family we've had problems. But I'm so proud of all of my kids,\" the X Factor judge told PEOPLE in 2007.

Here's everything to know about Ozzy Osbourne's six kids. Jessica Osbourne Ozzy Osbourne at home with his children Jessica and Louis on August 19, 1978. Staff/Mirrorpix/Getty Before he wed Sharon, Ozzy was married to Riley, with whom he welcomed two children. While her younger siblings have all made at least one appearance on Ozzy's show, Jessica never joined her family on camera \u2014 though she did make an impression another way. In one season 2 episode, Ozzy found out he was a grandfather for the first time when his daughter called him to let him know she was in labor and had given birth to a daughter named Isabelle. Jessica, who remained in England with her mom after the Osbourne family moved to Los Angeles, has continued to live her life out of the spotlight. Louis Osbourne Ozzy Osbourne and his son Louis Osbourne appear on \"The Late Late Show\" at RTE Studios on October 9, 2009 in Dublin. Ozzy's older son, Louis, was born in 1975. Like Jessica, he has lived primarily out of the public eye though he has spoken about his famous family on occasion. In 2013, Louis told Birmingham Live that he got along with his siblings and tried to \u201cmeet on special occasions\" when they visited the U.K., where he also lives. In his personal life, Louis met his wife Louise in 2002 when he was visiting his dad, who had just received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The two got engaged just months later and wed in Louise's native Ireland before moving full-time to Birmingham, U.K. There, Louis has continued his work as a label owner, DJ and producer while his wife works in the acting industry. The couple share two children. Louis was present for his dad's final performance with Black Sabbath in July 2025, just days before he died. Following the concert, Louis wrote on Facebook that the show was \"hugely emotional\" for him. \"I was sobbing at times. It was everything we wanted it to be and more,\" he wrote, per BBC. \"I had been anxious for months about this as I've been worried about my dad's ability to perform with his Parkinson's disease.\" He continued, \"I just wanted it to be a dignified send off for him. But as soon as he started singing we knew he was gonna nail it.\" Elliot Ozzy was also a father to Riley's son, Elliot, from a previous relationship. Ozzy adopted Elliot after marrying Riley in 1971. Unlike his siblings, Elliot has remained largely out of the public eye. Aimee Osbourne, 41 Aimee Osbourne. Monica Schipper/Getty Aimee was born on Sept. 2, 1983, in London. While Aimee lived with the family in California until she was 16, she moved out when Ozzy, Sharon, Kelly and Jack began filming The Osbournes. \"She felt too that she didn't want to grow up on camera. She hated the idea \u2014 it was appalling to her,\" Sharon said of Aimee during a 2018 episode of The Talk. \"And so she left at 16 and I regret every day that she did.\" The mom of three added, \"It broke my heart when she moved.\" Aimee later explained that she did not want to sacrifice her privacy by appearing on the show. \"I had grown up around having a pretty well-known dad anyway, and ... I always really valued my privacy within that family,\" she said. \"And for me personally, and for who I am, you know, as far as morally and also just to give myself a chance to actually develop into a human being as opposed to just being remembered for being a teenager, it didn't really line up with what I saw my future as.\" Aimee has followed in her dad's musical footsteps. In 2003, she appeared in the MTV musical adaptation of Wuthering Heights. Now, she's the lead singer of the synth-pop band ARO. The band debuted its first single, \"Raining Gold,\" in 2015, which is inspired by her life as the daughter of a larger-than-life rockstar. \"I wanted the song to touch on how overwhelming and isolating it feels to be constantly misunderstood and the importance of choosing to break free from that and just believing in yourself,\" she said of the song during an interview with Rolling Stone. \"It's so valuable to always try and put yourself in someone else's shoes. I hope this song reminds people of that.\" Aimee appears to have a good relationship with her parents, supporting Ozzy during his brief split from Sharon in 2016. As for her siblings, however, she hasn't always maintained a close bond with Kelly and Jack over the years. \"I wouldn't say there is an ease between us, but there is an acceptance,\" she told The Independent in 2015. \"Do we socialise? No.\" Kelly shed more light on the sisters' relationship during a 2021 appearance on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast. \"We don't talk,\" she said. \"We're just really different. She doesn't understand me and I don't understand her.\" Aimee and Jack, on the other hand, share a production company, Osbourne Media. In May 2022, Aimee survived a deadly fire in a Hollywood recording studio. She and her producer escaped the building, but one person did not. \"It is utterly heartbreaking that someone lost their life today in this fire & we are sending our prayers to this person & their family. What happened today was beyond horrific,\" Sharon wrote on Instagram. Kelly Osbourne, 40 Kelly Osbourne. Ethan Miller/Getty Kelly was born on Oct. 27, 1984, in London. She was only 17 years old when The Osbournes first aired and made her a household name. Like her dad and older sister, Kelly pursued a career in music, albeit a short one. In 2002, she released her debut album Shut Up!, followed by her 2005 album Sleep in Nothing. She then transitioned to a career path more similar to her mom's, landing gigs as a television host and judge on shows like Fashion Police, Project Catwalk and Project Runway. In 2009, she competed on ABC's Dancing with the Stars and came in third place. The reality star has also been open about her sobriety journey over the years, revealing that her addiction dates back to her early teens. Kelly told PEOPLE during a 2009 interview that she first began abusing painkillers at age 13 when she was prescribed Vicodin after getting her tonsils out. Kelly entered rehab for the first time at age 19 and has sought treatment several times in the years since. While she is sober today, following a relapse after four years of sobriety, she says addiction is something she will always struggle with and have to work at. In 2022, Kelly announced she was dating Slipknot rocker Sid Wilson. \"After 23 years of friendship I can't believe where we have ended up!\" Kelly captioned a photo of the two of them kissing on Valentine's Day 2022. \"You are my best friend, my soulmate and I am so deeply in love with you Sidney George Wilson. \ud83d\udc9c.\" Months later, Kelly announced that she and Wilson were expecting their first child together. \"I am over the moon to announce that I am going to be a Mumma,\" she wrote alongside a selfie of her holding the ultrasound photo. \"To say that I am happy does not quite cut it. I am ecstatic! \ud83e\udd30\ud83d\udc9c.\" Sharon revealed that the couple had welcomed a son named Sidney during an episode of The Talk in January 2023, although Kelly wasn't too happy that her mom let the news slip. Prior to the birth, Ozzy had revealed the baby's sex without his daughter's permission, but Kelly later explained that he was just \"so excited.\" \"Kelly is big and she's beautiful and I love it,\" the proud grandfather said ahead of baby Sidney's arrival, adding \"the first thing that I'm gonna buy [the baby] is a microphone.\" Kelly and Wilson got engaged in July 2025, when he popped the question at Ozzy's final Black Sabbath concert. Later, Kelly shared a video of the moment on Instagram. After Ozzy interrupted the moment by jokingly saying, \"F--- off, you\u2019re not marrying my daughter,\" Wilson told Kelly, \u201cNothing would make me happier than to spend the rest of my life with you. So, in front of your family and all of our friends, Kelly, will you marry me?\u201d Jack Osbourne, 39 Jack Osbourne. Jeff Kravitz/AMA2019/FilmMagic Jack was born on Nov. 8, 1985, in London, where he lived for the first six years of his life. The Osbournes then moved from London to California and back again, staying in England until Jack was 11, at which point the family relocated to Beverly Hills permanently. Jack was 16 when The Osbournes debuted, and like his sister, he struggled with substance abuse. He entered a two-month rehab program in 2003, while the show was still on the air, and has been sober ever since. \"I don't want my life to be controlled by a drug,\" he said in an MTV interview shortly after he finished treatment. In October 2012, he married actress Lisa Stelly in an intimate ceremony in Hawaii. Over the course of their relationship, they welcomed three daughters: Pearl Clementine, Andy Rose and Minnie Theodora. When Jack and Stelly were expecting their first baby, Sharon could barely contain her excitement about becoming a first-time grandparent. \"I am going to be the grandmother from hell because I am going to spoil this baby so bad,\" she told PEOPLE at the time. \"My son and Lisa are going to be like, 'Get her out of here!' \" Also that year, Jack was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord. \"It's just one of those things you take as it comes,\" Jack told PEOPLE. \"It's all about your outlook.\" In October 2018, Jack and Stelly announced they were separating; their divorce was finalized in March 2019. Jack has established a successful career as a paranormal investigator. His first show, Portals to Hell, debuted in 2019. Currently, he stars alongside his parents in The Osbournes Want to Believe. In the Travel Channel series, Jack shows Ozzie and Sharon footage of paranormal activity and tries to get their take on it. \"We're skeptical believers,\" Ozzy told PEOPLE of the show. \"Some of it is hokey, but some of the stuff he showed us, we're both baffled by it.\" In November 2019, Jack went public with his relationship with Aree Gearhart after they attended the American Music Awards together. By December 2021, Jack and Gearhart were engaged. The couple announced they were expecting their first baby together in March 2022. Their daughter, Maple Artemis, was born on July 9, 2022. \"I'm very happy to announce Maple Artemis Osbourne!\" Jack captioned a photo of the baby. \"Aree and Maple are doing great and are happy and healthy.\" Leave a Comment Read more: Celebrity Celebrity Family Celebrity Kids"

Credit : Chris Walter/WireImage NEED TO KNOW In the 1970s, Ozzy Osbourne, Terrence \"Geezer\" Butler, Tony Iommi and Bill Ward rose to fame as members of the legendary rock band Black SabbathOn July 22, three weeks after they reunited for a final show, Osbourne's family announced his death at 76 years oldThat day, Iommi wrote on Instagram that he, Butler and Ward had \"lost our brother\" Ozzy Osbourne will forever be remembered for the sound of his legendary rock band, Black Sabbath. The legendary rock band was formed in 1968 by Osbourne, Terrence \"Geezer\" Butler, Tony Iommi and Bill Ward. The musicians rose to fame throughout the 1970s after releasing several successful albums together, but Osbourne's dismissal from the group in 1979 led to various reformations in the years to come. Decades later, the original members came back together for one final album, 13, which was released in 2013 and followed by a 2016 tour, titled The End. More recently, in early July, the band reunited for their farewell gig, billed as Back to the Beginning, a benefit concert in Birmingham, England. On July 18, Ozzy announced on Instagram that the performance \u2014 which he said was \"a celebration of Ozzy Osbourne and the legacy of Black Sabbath\" \u2014 would be released in theaters as a concert film next year. Nearly three weeks after the performance, the band lost one of its own, as Osbourne's family announced that he had died at 76 years old. In a conversation with BBC following Osbourne's death, Iommi reflected on their final performance, saying, \"He loved what he did, he loved music, he loved playing together, and I'm so glad we had the opportunity of getting together again to do the [farewell] show.\" He continued, \"It was brilliant being with all the guys again, and the atmosphere, and it was brilliant for Ozzy because he really wanted to do that, he felt at home there and it was good for all of us.\" In the wake of Osbourne's death, here's where the members of Black Sabbath are now \u2014 and what they've said about the rock star's legacy. 01 of 04 Ozzy Osbourne Ozzy Osbourne performs with Black Sabbath in 1974 in Los Angeles ; Ozzy Osbourne during the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony on Oct. 19, 2024, in Cleveland.

After being fired from the band in 1979 due to excessive drug and alcohol use, Osbourne went on to pursue a successful solo career. However, he rejoined in 1997 and went on to help record the band's final studio album, 13. In 2006, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath. In 2024, the Grammy winner was inducted once more as a solo artist. Over the years, Osbourne's career faced setbacks as he faced several health issues. Most notably, in January 2020, he revealed he'd been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a nervous system disorder that affects movement, in 2003. However, that didn't stop the Prince of Darkness from reuniting with Black Sabbath for their farewell concert in early July 2025. But on July 22, Osbourne's family confirmed his death in a statement to PEOPLE, saying, \"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning.\" \"He was with his family and surrounded by love,\" the statement continued. \"We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\" Osbourne is survived by his wife, Sharon Osbourne, and his six kids: Elliot, Jessica, Louis, Aimee, Kelly and Jack. 02 of 04 Tony Iommi Tony Iommi performs on stage with Black Sabbath at the Gaumont on June 25, 1980, in Southampton, England ; Tony Iommi attends the announcement of Black Sabbath's final show \"Back To The Beginning\" on Feb. 5, 2025, in Birmingham, England.

As for his personal life, he was living in England's West Midlands with his fourth wife, Maria Sjoholm, as of October 2018, per Scotland's The Herald.
