      "feedback": "The draft has a solid regime-based spine and useful cross‑topic links, but it needs a sharper, testable causal chain, tighter first‑principles grounding, explicit scenario structure, and fuller use of the cited numbers; it also wades into euro-area and crypto themes without a clear crosswalk, and several claims lack a direct citation or rely on repeated IDs without reconciliation. Actionable edits: 1) build a crisp Regime Matrix (A/B/C) with explicit thresholds (e.g., core CPI MoM around 0.30–0.40% as the near‑term anchor, wage‑growth momentum, Jackson Hole signals) and map each regime to quantified effects on discount rates, term premia, and FX, plus updated probability weights (start with ~50/30/20 but show data‑driven updates); 2) articulate a first‑principles discount-rate channel (neutral rate R*, inflation risk premium, term premium) and show how regime shifts mechanically flow into equity/credit valuations and cyclical vs defensive tilts; 3) tighten the scenario structure with base, upside, and downside paths, specify catalysts (Jackson Hole communications, capex cadence, energy supply shifts, crypto/tokenization liquidity), and provide explicit invalidation criteria (e.g., sustained wage momentum breakdown or a persistence surprise delaying easing); 4) quantify and harmonize the core numbers: Ford EV metrics, ACMR 2025 revenue and margins, oil path with regime‑dependent Brent/WTI ranges, RWA targets (16T by 2030), crypto/tokenization markers (4.2B 2025, ETH 4k–5k, BTC 110k–125k); present them as ranges and tie each to a regime or scenario; 5) tighten citation discipline: attach the exact IDs to each factual claim, audit for conflicts across sources (e.g., Regime A/B/C probabilities and oil paths) and reconcile them into a single base‑case with clearly stated sensitivities; 6) ensure alignment with SECTION FOCUS by foregrounding the decisive macro/policy/flows/valuation channels in a single narrative, then a crisp watch‑list of 5–6 signals (e.g., Jackson Hole communications, capex cadence, energy pivots, crypto/tokenization flows,EV‑margin trajectories) with trigger levels and expected market readings; 7) prune redundancies, remove repeated IDs (e.g., multiple T1QE6JPIX mentions) and avoid non‑sequitur insertions; 8) present the conclusion as a one‑page, decision‑oriented synthesis that explicitly marks where the view is most fragile (e.g., if inflation persistence accelerates or wage momentum collapses) and what would overturn the base case; 9) finally, validate every assertion against the cited IDs and ensure the euro-area and US strands are cross‑walked with the same regime logic rather than treated as separate, ad‑hoc inputs.",
