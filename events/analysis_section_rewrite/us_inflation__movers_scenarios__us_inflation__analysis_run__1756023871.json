      "feedback": "Overall assessment: the draft nails the key regime themes (cloud/AI, labor/automation, EV policy) and anchors many claims to IDs, but it lacks a tight, first-principles causal chain from regime to valuation, and the 3–6 month map reads as a collection of plausible nuggets rather than a formal Base Case/Upside/Downside with explicit probabilities and invalidation rules; the 0–3 week block is overly tactical and not cleanly integrated into the horizon framing; ensure every assertion that drives risk premia or cash-flow outcomes is quantitatively anchored to source facts and cited IDs; to upgrade, restructure into a three-horizon narrative with clear triggers and numeric thresholds (e.g., CPI, DXY, oil, tariff signals) and reconcile competing threads (cloud durability vs EV dispersion) under a single regime map anchored to core IDs (0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU, P0K0UEOHU); quantify key numbers to replace vagueness (MSFT Q4 growth 18% YoY; Azure/AI growth 39%; Rivian R2 EBITDA breakeven by 2027 and ~$45k starting price; DOE loan $6.6B; Range of 1–1.5% productivity uplift) and enforce in-text citations for every fact; mandate one-sentence Up/Down items if you keep the four-item format, each with Time Window, Driver/Mechanism, What to watch, and Probability%, and provide explicit invalidation rules (e.g., CPI >3.2% or DXY move beyond 2%, tariff extension delay) to enable rapid re-pricing.",
