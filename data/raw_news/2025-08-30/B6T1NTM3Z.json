  "description": "Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., threatened to use the nuclear option to change Senate rules to push through Trump's nominees as Senate Democrats' blockade continues.",
  "content": "FIRST ON FOX: Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso is ready to go nuclear on Senate Democrats and their blockade of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees.Before leaving Washington, D.C., to their respective home states, Senate Republicans were on the verge of a deal with their colleagues across the aisle to hammer out a deal to ram through dozens of Trump\u2019s picks for non-controversial positions.But those talks fell apart when Trump nuked any further negotiations over funding demands from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Currently, there are 145 pending nominations on the Senate\u2019s executive calendar, with that number expected to balloon when the upper chamber reopens for business.SENATE GOP READY TO GO NUCLEAR AFTER SCHUMER'S 'POLITICAL EXTORTION' OF NOMINEESLawmakers are set to return on Tuesday, and Barrasso, R-Wyo., wants to immediately tackle the nomination quandary. He\u2019s engaged in a public pressure campaign, writing an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal directly calling out Schumer.Meanwhile, he\u2019s facilitated talks among Senate Republicans on the best path forward, and told Fox News Digital in an interview that, at this point, he\u2019s willing to do anything necessary to see the president\u2019s picks confirmed.\"We need to either get a lot of cooperation from the Democrats, or we're going to have to roll over them with changes of the rules that we're going to be able to do in a unilateral way, as well as President Trump making recess appointments,\" he said.Senate Democrats, under Schumer's direction, are unlikely to play ball, however.Schumer, in response to Barrasso\u2019s public jab against him and Senate Democrats, contended in a statement that \"historically bad nominees deserve a historic level of scrutiny by Senate Democrats.\"TRUMP TELLS SCHUMER TO 'GO TO HELL' OVER SENATE NOMINEE DEAL FUNDING DEMANDS AFTER NEGOTIATIONS COLLAPSE\"Anybody nominated by President Trump is, in Schumer's words, \u2018historically bad.\u2019 Why? Because they were nominated by President Trump,\" Barrasso shot back. \"That is his sole criteria for which these people are being gone after and filibustered, each and every one of them, even those that are coming out of committee, many, many of whom are with bipartisan support.\"Unilaterally changing the rules, or the nuclear option, would allow Republicans to make tweaks to the confirmation process without help from Democrats, but it could also kneecap further negotiations on key items that would require their support to advance beyond the Senate filibuster.Barrasso was not worried about taking that route, however, and noted that the nominees that he and other Republicans were specifically considering would be \"sub-Cabinet level positions\" and ambassadors.Up for discussion are changes to the debate time, what kind of nominee could qualify for a speedier process and whether to give the president runway to make recess appointments, which would require the Senate to go into recess and allow Trump to make appointments on a temporary basis.DEMS DIG IN, TRUMP DEMANDS ALL: NOMINEE FIGHT BOILS OVER IN SENATE AS GOP LOOKS FOR A DEAL\"When you take a look at this right now, it takes a 30-minute roll-call vote to get on cloture, and then two hours of debate time, and then another 30-minute roll-call vote,\" Barrasso said. \"Well, that's three hours, and it's time when you can't do legislation, you can't do any of the other things.\"But there is a menu of key items that Congress will have to deal with when they return, particularly the deadline to fund the government by Sept. 30.Barrasso acknowledged that reality, and noted that it was because of the hefty schedule that he wanted a rules change to be put front and center.\"There's not going to be any time to \u2014 or there's going to be limited time, I should say, to actually get people through the nominations process, which is just going to drag on further, and you'll have more people having hearings and coming out of committees,\" he said.  \"This backlog is going to worsen this traffic jam at the Schumer toll booth. So, we are going to do something, because this cannot stand.\"",

      "text": "The path to a deal on confirming a slew of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees appeared shaky at best in the Senate Saturday, as Republicans and Democrats sparred over terms and conditions to find a way forward.\nSenators were supposed to be long gone from Washington by now, but Trump\u2019s demands to ram his nominees through Senate Democrats\u2019 historic blockade have kept lawmakers in town. But by late afternoon, not much progress had been made.\nRECESS ON ICE AS REPUBLICANS HUNKER DOWN FOR HIGH-STAKES NOMINEE BLITZ\nWhen asked if any headway had been made, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told Fox News Digital, \"Unfortunately, not really, no.\"\n\"The Dems are dug in on a position that's just not working,\" he said.\nNegotiations have been ongoing among Republicans, Democrats and the White House. Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met last night to discuss an offer from Democrats. The two have not spoken directly since then, instead communicating through intermediaries, Thune said. However, he expected they would talk again later Saturday.\nSenate Republicans want to strike a deal that would see nominees that made it through committee with bipartisan support get lightning-fast votes on the floor, but Schumer has not relented.\nSENATE GOP EYES RULES REVOLT AS DEMS STONEWALL TRUMP NOMINEES\nA source familiar with negotiations said Senate Democrats are looking for deals on the release of funding withheld by the White House and a guarantee that there will be no future rescissions packages \u2014 a particular sticking point for them heading into the looming deadline to fund the government. In exchange, they are offering a tranche of nominees to go ahead now, and another round later in the fall.\nBut Trump, who is at his Bedminster, N.J., golf course, has demanded that lawmakers stay in town and pass the entire slate of nominees on the Senate calendar, which has ballooned to over 150.\nThe president lauded Senate Republicans in a post to Truth Social on Saturday \"for fighting, over the Weekend and far beyond, if necessary, in order to get my great Appointments approved, and on their way to helping us MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\"The Radical Left Democrat Senators are doing everything possible to DELAY these wonderful and talented people from being approved,\" he said. \"If George Washington or Abraham Lincoln were up for approval, the Dems would delay, as long as possible, then vote them out.\"\nGRIDLOCK CRUMBLES AS SENATE ADVANCES SPENDING BILLS IN RACE AGAINST SHUTDOWN\nWhile Republicans have confirmed well over 100 of the president\u2019s nominees, the only pick to make it to the floor without objection was Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nNot a single one of Trump\u2019s nominees has gotten a voice vote or gone through unanimous consent, two floor actions that have been routinely used to advance nominees in the upper chamber throughout the years. At this point four years ago, 49 of former President Joe Biden\u2019s picks had been confirmed by voice vote.\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., explained that Republicans have three options that they have enough support among the conference to move forward with: reach a deal with Democrats; adjourn the Senate and give the president runway for recess appointments and finally, a rules-change package, which some Republicans consider the \"nuclear option.\"\nOn recess appointments, a move floated since before Trump took office, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., contended it would be up to Democrats whether Republicans actually went through with it.\n\"The Democrats\u2019 obstruction is leading to, in very short order, us taking the necessary actions to give the President power to make recess appointments,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile it would be a touchy move that would set off a firestorm among Democrats, Republicans aren\u2019t afraid to move ahead with a rules change. When asked if a rule change should be done before lawmakers leave town, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said \"I think that\u2019d be best.\"\nBut the preference is to strike a deal, preferably on a potential package on over 60 nominees that were advanced out of committee in a bipartisan fashion.\n\"The reason why we're that way is because Schumer led us down this road,\" Mullin said. \"He didn't have to do it this way.\""

      "text": "Hours of tense negotiations to strike a deal on President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees blew up Saturday night, and now lawmakers are headed home.\nSenate Republicans and Democrats were quick to point the finger at one another for the deal\u2019s demise, but it was ultimately Trump who nuked the talks.\nPIRRO CONFIRMED AS D.C. U.S. ATTORNEY AMID PARTISAN CLASH AS DEM NOMINEE BLOCKADE CONTINUES\nIn a lengthy post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of \"demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees.\"\n\"This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name,\" Trump said. \"Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!\"\n\"Do not accept the offer,\" he continued. \"Go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\nDEMS DIG IN, TRUMP DEMANDS ALL: NOMINEE FIGHT BOILS OVER IN SENATE AS GOP LOOKS FOR A DEAL\nInstead of finding a pathway to vote on as many as 60 of the president\u2019s nominees, all of which moved through committee with bipartisan support, lawmakers rapid-fire voted on seven before leaving Washington until September.\nBut Schumer treated Trump's move as a victory for Senate Democrats. He countered that it was the president who gave up on negotiations while he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., worked to find a bipartisan solution, \"provided the White House and Senate Republicans met our demands.\"\n\"He took his ball, he went home, leaving Democrats and Republicans alike wondering what the hell happened,\" Schumer said, standing next to a poster-sized version of the president\u2019s post.\n\"Trump's all-caps Tweet said it all,\" he continued. \"In a fit of rage, Trump threw in the towel, sent Republicans home, and was unable to do the basic work of negotiating.\"\nBut prior to the president\u2019s edict, both sides of the aisle believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough to both meet Trump\u2019s desire to see his nominees confirmed and leave Washington.\nThune said that there were \"lots of offers\" made between him and Schumer over the course of negotiations.\n\"There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end,\" he said.\nSenate Democrats wanted the White House to unfreeze billions in National Institute of Health and foreign aid funding, in addition to a future agreement that no more clawback packages would come from the White House.\nIn exchange, they would greenlight several of Trump\u2019s non-controversial nominees.\nRECESS ON ICE AS REPUBLICANS HUNKER DOWN FOR HIGH-STAKES NOMINEE BLITZ\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., accused Schumer of going \"too far\" by upping the price tag on his demands.\n\"We've had three different deals since last night,\" he said. \"And every time it's been, every time it's \u2018I want more,\u2019\" Mullin said of Schumer\u2019s demands.\nHe said that Republicans weren\u2019t caught off guard by Trump\u2019s call to halt talks, and noted that the White House had been heavily involved in negotiations.\n\"You get to a realization that there was, it was never about making a deal,\" he continued. \"They want to go out and say the President's being unrealistic, and because he can't answer to his base to make a deal like we have in every other president in history.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNow, Republicans won\u2019t pursue recess appointments, but Mullin noted that moving ahead with a rule change to the confirmation process when lawmakers return in September was going to happen in response.\n\"The asks evolved on both sides quite a bit over time,\" Thune said. \"But in the end, we never got to a place where we had both sides agree to lock it in.\"\nSenate Democrats, on the other hand, countered that their offer never changed, and that Republicans kept increasing the number of nominees they wanted across the line, and attempted to include more controversial, partisan picks.\nSchumer wouldn't reveal the details of his demands, but charged that any changes to Senate rules would be a \"huge mistake,\" and urged Trump to work with Senate Democrats moving forward, particularly as Congress hurtles toward yet another deadline to fund the government in September.\n\"They should stop listening to him,\" Schumer said. \"If they want to do what's good for the American people, they shouldn't be in blind obeisance to Donald Trump.\""

      "text": "Senate Republicans are mulling whether to go nuclear after negotiations with Senate Democrats to ram through President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees fell apart over the weekend.\nThe path to confirming dozens of Trump\u2019s outstanding nominees was destroyed when the president accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of \"political extortion,\" and charged that the Democratic leader\u2019s asking price for nominees was too high.\nNow, lawmakers have left Washington without a deal to bundle dozens of nominees that made it through committee with bipartisan support, and a change to how the Senate handles the confirmation process is on the horizon.\nSenate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., berated Schumer and Senate Democrats for their \"unprecedented\" blocks of the president\u2019s nominees, and noted that every pick had been filibustered save for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who glided through the Senate earlier this year.\n\"We have been working through the list, but there is still a large backlog because of the unprecedented filibuster by the Democrats of every nominee,\" Barrasso said. \"And if they don\u2019t change their behavior, we\u2019re going to have to change how things are done here, because a president needs to have his or her team in place.\"\nDEMS DIG IN, TRUMP DEMANDS ALL: NOMINEE FIGHT BOILS OVER IN SENATE AS GOP LOOKS FOR A DEAL\nUnder normal circumstances, changing the rules in the Senate would require 67 votes, meaning that Senate Democrats would have to be on board with a change. However, there is a path that lawmakers refer to as the nuclear option, which allows for rules changes to only need a simple majority.\nThere is the political will among Republicans to change the rules, but doing so would open the door for Senate Democrats to do the same when they get into power once more.\n\"I think that way is going to happen anyways, because of what Schumer has done. He's forced this, and it's ridiculous that he's doing this,\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said. \"And so, whatever, we're at this point, and we'll do, you know what they say, every action requires an equal [reaction], and that's what we're at right now.\"\nSome of the options on the table include shortening the debate time for nominees, getting rid of procedural votes for some lower-level nominees, grouping certain civilian nominees \"en bloc\" \u2013 something that is already done for military nominees \u2013 and, at the committee level, deciding whether to lower the number of nominees subject to the confirmation process.\nGRIDLOCK CRUMBLES AS SENATE ADVANCES SPENDING BILLS IN RACE AGAINST SHUTDOWN\nCurrently, over 1,200 positions go through Senate confirmation. Senate Republicans have been able to confirm over 130 of Trump\u2019s picks so far, but had a loftier goal of doing at least 60 more before leaving town until September.\nAnd there are over 140 nominees still pending on the Senate\u2019s calendar.\n\"I think they're desperately in need of change,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters. \"I think that the last six months have demonstrated that this process, nominations, is broken. And so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.\"\nAs to when lawmakers will try to run with a rules change is still in the air. The Senate is gone from Washington until early September and will return to a looming deadline to avert a partial government shutdown.\nBefore leaving town, the Senate did advance a trio of spending bills \u2013 a first in the upper chamber since 2018 \u2013 but those same bills are unlikely to pass muster in the House, given that they spend at higher levels than the ones greenlit by the House GOP.\nRamming a rules change through without Democrats could also come at a price for government funding negotiations. Schumer said a possible rules change would be a \"huge mistake\" for Republicans to do on their own.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Because when they go at it alone, they screw up for the American people and for themselves,\" he said.\nWhen asked if there were any possible rule changes that he and Senate Democrats could agree to, Schumer said, \"We should be working together on legislation to get things done for the American people.\"\n\"That's the way to go, not changing the rules, because when they change the rules, they say, \u2018Only we're going to decide what's good for the American people,\u2019 and every time they do that, the American people lose,\" Schumer said.\nStill, Republicans were unhappy with the way negotiations devolved after days of back and forth.\n\"We actually, we wanted a deal,\" Mullin said. \"And these people deserve to be put in position\u2026 they're going to say that we're trying to do a nuclear option. The fact is, they \u2013 Schumer \u2013 went nuclear a long time.\""
