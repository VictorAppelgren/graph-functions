      "summary": "The article highlights four lesser‑known Italian coastal regions—Cinque Terre, Puglia, the Cilento Coast, and Calabria—as alternatives to the crowded Amalfi Coast. It describes Cinque Terre’s five villages, their hiking trails, and local specialties like pesto and white wine. Puglia is praised for its crystal‑blue beaches such as Baia dei Turchi and its iconic trulli houses. The Cilento Coast offers national park scenery, turquoise beaches like Cala Bianca, and local dishes featuring buffalo mozzarella and swordfish. Calabria’s “Violet Coast” and the “Coast of the Gods” boast purple waters, historic towns like Scilla and Tropea, and spicy cuisine with Calabrian chiles and ‘nduja.",
