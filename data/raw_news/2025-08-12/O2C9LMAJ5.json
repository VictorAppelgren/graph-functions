  "content": "Digital storytelling platform WEBTOON (NASDAQ:WBTN) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations , with sales up 8.5% year on year to $348.3 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was optimistic at $385 million at the midpoint, 2.3% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.03 per share was 85.6% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy WEBTOON? Find out in our full research report.\n\u2022 Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $385 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $376.2 million\n\u2022 EBITDA guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $4.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $10.32 million\n\u2022 Operating Margin: -2.5%, up from -24.6% in the same quarter last year\n\u2022 Free Cash Flow was $6.38 million, up from -$3.75 million in the same quarter last year Junkoo Kim, Founder and CEO, said, \u201cWe are pleased to report strong second quarter results, with both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA coming in above the top end of our guidance range. Total revenue was up 5.5% on a constant currency basis, with growth in all three revenue streams \u2013 Paid Content, Advertising, and IP Adaptations \u2013 as we continue to build our leadership position globally.\u201d Pioneering a vertical-scrolling format optimized for mobile devices, WEBTOON Entertainment (NASDAQ:WBTN) operates a global platform where creators publish serialized web-comics and web-novels that users can read in bite-sized episodes. Reviewing a company\u2019s top-line performance can reveal insights into its business quality. Growth can signal it\u2019s capitalizing on a new product or emerging industry trend. With $1.37 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, WEBTOON is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. We can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of monthly active users, which reached 155 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, WEBTOON\u2019s monthly active users averaged 2% year-on-year declines. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see the company\u2019s monetization has risen.\n\nThis quarter, WEBTOON reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.5%, and its $348.3 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 10.7% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 11.2% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and suggests its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance. Today\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next. WEBTOON\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has generally stayed the same, averaging negative 6.5% over the last four years. Unprofitable business services companies that fail to improve their losses or grow sales rapidly require extra attention. In WEBTOON\u2019s case, it seems it\u2019s deferring current profits by investing heavily. Looking at the trend in its profitability, WEBTOON\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last four years, meaning it will take a fundamental shift in the business model to change. Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. WEBTOON broke even from a free cash flow perspective over the last three years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. WEBTOON\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $6.38 million in Q2, equivalent to a 1.8% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends carry greater meaning. It was good to see WEBTOON beat analysts\u2019 revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue guidance for next quarter exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 24.7% to $11.67 immediately following the results. WEBTOON may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? If you\u2019re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.",

      "text": "High-Quality Businesses Win\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is an exciting stock because it offers exposure to the multi-decade mega-trend of automation. On top of that, its role in automating IT Service management puts it in a prime position to benefit from the introduction of generative AI.\nWe are long-term investors, not speculators, so we don\u2019t celebrate the short-term wins. Nonetheless, we are grateful and fortunate that Lead Analyst Anthony Lee chose a good time (August 17, 2023) to issue our ServiceNow buy recommendation exclusively to paying members of StockStory Edge. The stock was roughly $540 a share then.\nDespite the 85+% share price increase since then, we still have ServiceNow in our portfolio. Note that we (the StockStory team) only bought shares in ServiceNow days after recommending it to members of StockStory Edge. And if in the future we no longer consider ServiceNow compelling, StockStory Edge members will be the first to know. We never trade personally until after informing our members and giving them 5 trading days to act.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nServiceNow (NOW): StockStory Edge Stock Of The Month For August 2023\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has been a stock market winner ever since its summer 2012 IPO. It priced at $18, closed its first day of trading at $24.60, and hasn\u2019t looked back. The shares now trade at around $1,000. Since its IPO, this is not just one of the best-performing stocks in enterprise software but in the whole market.\nJust because the stock is up big, however, doesn\u2019t mean the opportunity is gone.\nIn this case? Quite the opposite.\nThat\u2019s because ServiceNow offers sticky mission-critical products across IT, HR, and customer service that reduce manual work, eliminate human error, and keep large corporations functioning. The company generates reliable subscription revenue from its happy customers and because of attractive unit economics, that revenue turns into high profits and free cash margins. The excess cash churned out by the business can be used to continually widen ServiceNow's lead over the competition competition from a brand, product, and customer service standpoint.\nThe kicker is that ServiceNow is now very much a Generative AI beneficiary due to its partnership with NVIDIA.\nWhat Does ServiceNow Do?\nServiceNow\u2019s software platform helps businesses automate workflows and gives them a birds-eye view of their operations, unifying what has become an increasingly complex technology stack for many companies.\nServiceNow was founded in 2003 when current Chairman of the Board Fred Luddy recognized the inefficiencies of traditional IT Service Management (ITSM) at a time when employees might have to jump through multiple hoops to request help and then sit on standby for hours until someone from the IT department fixed their problem.\nLuddy envisioned a world where technology could speed up these slow, cumbersome processes and launched the company\u2019s first product in 2006.\nToday, corporations of all sizes rely on ServiceNow to not only streamline IT but also manage their entire organization through a simple yet comprehensive online portal. For example, onboarding a new employee involves HR for payroll, IT for device needs, and whatever is specific to that person\u2019s department.\nServiceNow brings these disparate systems together and automates the onboarding process, which will inevitably happen over and over again.\nServiceNow\u2019s all-in-one platform gives customers numerous products to choose from, as shown in the graphic below. These software programs allow administrators to execute repetitive, labor-intensive tasks with the click of a button. On top of that, each product is wrapped in analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities, allowing customers to extract powerful insights from their data.\nThe company\u2019s ambition doesn\u2019t end there. ServiceNow has a strong track record of releasing new products to boost its customers\u2019 productivity, the latest being a low-code platform that enables non-technical employees to build custom software applications. ServiceNow constantly surprises its customers (and investors) with innovation, granting it huge upside potential.\nWhy We Love An Investment In ServiceNow\nFor starters, we love the software subscription business model. If you sell sneakers, for instance, customers who bought from you last quarter may not come back again this quarter. On the other hand, software customers often sign multi-year contracts, resulting in recurring, predictable revenues and lower customer acquisition costs.\nWithin software, we believe ServiceNow has a very strong brand. \u201cNobody ever got fired for buying IBM\u201d was a common phrase in IT circles in the 1980s and early 1990s, and we argue that NOW is heading in the same direction. 85% of Fortune 500 companies are ServiceNow customers and those controlling IT budgets view the company as trustworthy, reliable, and safe because of how many happy, loyal, and influential customers it has.\nFurthermore, ServiceNow\u2019s customers rarely cancel their subscriptions because its products are deeply intertwined with company operations. ServiceNow is capable of replacing a multitude of legacy software systems\u2013everything from technical support to managing downtime. That means switching to ServiceNow can make life easier for employees, and once it\u2019s there, switching away is very disruptive. This results in a sky-high renewal rate of around 98%.\nTurning to profit, ServiceNow stands out with its gross margin of around 85% on its subscription revenue. From there, its adjusted operating margin and free cash flow margin will both hover around 30% when 2024 is all said and done. This makes ServiceNow a money-printing machine with the capital to grow its competitive position by improving existing products, adding new products, and promoting its brand.\nWhat Does ServiceNow\u2019s Future Hold?\nWe think much of ServiceNow\u2019s future growth will stem from selling more products to existing customers. The chart below shows how its \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy has developed over time. ServiceNow has successfully upsold its customers as 82% of contracts in 2023 featured five or more products purchased, up from 54% in 2019 (note that NNACV is 'net new annual contract value', a proxy for incremental revenue). We expect this number to be around 85% when the company reports 2024 results.\nAnother underappreciated growth lever is ServiceNow\u2019s pricing power. Before 2018, the company had one pricing tier for all products. That changed in 2018 when NOW introduced a \u2018Pro\u2019 tier for IT service management, whereby customers could upgrade their packages to get more analytical and AI functionality. What\u2019s next? Pro Plus, of course. It boasts \u201cgreater AI capabilities\u201d, and we expect it to contribute to future growth.\nWe think as more of ServiceNow\u2019s growth comes from existing customers, marketing expenses will moderate as a percentage of revenue, and thus we believe ServiceNow can earn higher profit margins as it grows.\nWhy Is Now The Right Time to Buy?\nServiceNow\u2019s price-to-forward-sales (next 12 months) multiple is currently over 15x, higher than most companies and higher than when we recommended it back in August 2023.\nNonetheless, we think ServiceNow can justify its valuation due to its long-term demand tailwinds, predictable subscription model, best-in-class customer retention, and robust profit margins. We'd also add that our extensive backtest research and analysis has shown that when it comes to outperforming the market, business quality matters much more than entry price--you get what you pay for. Said differently, valuation may seem daunting in the near term, but companies showing robust growth up and down the P&L \"grow into\" their premium multiples over time.\nThe cherry on top is that the company is increasingly showing that it will be a Generative AI beneficiary for years--even decades--to come. In May 2023, ServiceNow and NVIDIA announced a partnership. The principal goal for ServiceNow was to develop custom large language models (LLMs) using NVIDIA\u2019s technology.\nThe result includes intelligent virtual assistants and AI chatbots that can better resolve user issues and support requests. The secret sauce involves two parts: the GenAI\u2019s capability to pull knowledge from unstructured data such as source code, internal documents, or videos to answer questions combined with the LLMs\u2019 ability to summarize the information, eliminate the technical jargon, and give conversational responses.\nIn February 2024, ServiceNow unveiled an industry-specific solution for the telecom sector. \u2018Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management\u2019 is for an industry where consumers are particularly frustrated with their customer service interactions (have you ever called customer service about your smartphone bill or tried to change plans??). Surely, similar solutions for other consumer-facing industries will roll out soon.\nWe really like that these GenAI and LLM-driven offerings are easy for customers to understand and provide straightforward, quantifiable benefits (the cost of a customer service agent). Combined with ServiceNow\u2019s large customer base that already trusts the company in IT, Customer Service, and Human Resources, we think the company can start reaping the needle-moving benefits of GenAI in the near term.\nWith its product portfolio that is mission-critical for most customers, the expansion of this portfolio, and the GenAI tailwind, we think ServiceNow's revenue can sustain 20+% growth for a number of years.\nWith efficiency on expenses, especially the sales and marketing leverage, that revenue growth can translate into roughly 35% adjusted operating profit growth over time. It's had a big run in a short period and could take a breather in the near term, but we\u2019re convinced the stock could approach $1,550 by the end of 2027. If that occurs, it would still generate a return that likely beats the market despite the big jump in the share price since we first pitched the stock.\nLooking beyond 2026, we love a number of things about ServiceNow: the secular tailwinds it enjoys, the company's continually strengthening brand, and its products that bring customers great value and efficiency. This combination will drive stronger-for-longer revenue growth than the market anticipates.\nThis is a stock for investors looking for a high-quality business to hold over the long term.\nWhat Are The Key Risks And How Do We Feel About Them?\nThose stocks that are \u2018\u201csure things\u201d? They don\u2019t exist. Every investment has its risks.\nFor ServiceNow, we\u2019ve boiled them down into the three most important: competition, margins, and valuation.\nServiceNow has a tight grip on the IT service management market, but future returns will need to come from selling adjacent products where it faces stiffer competition. This means squaring off against Salesforce in customer service management, Microsoft in low-code/AI applications, and younger upstarts like Rippling in HR solutions. More competition means that ServiceNow may have to spend more on product development or accept lower gross margins to maintain its growth rate.\nThat leads us to our next risk\u2013margins. Our thesis holds that ServiceNow can reduce its expenses as a percentage of revenue as it grows. There\u2019s a chance this doesn\u2019t happen. For example, new products may gain less traction than expected or cost more than anticipated to develop.\nTurning to valuation, ServiceNow isn\u2019t conventionally cheap based on current earnings. It has a lofty P/E ratio, implying the market expects many years of growth ahead. That makes it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and sentiment around high-growth businesses.\nUltimately, we\u2019re comfortable with these risks because of ServiceNow\u2019s dominance, reputation, products, financial strength. We expect many years of healthy growth in revenue, profits, and free cash flow.\nClosing Thoughts\nWe\u2019re excited about ServiceNow at this stage in its evolution. Software is still eating the world, and within software, ServiceNow is an elite asset in terms of its products and financials. Please note that members of StockStory hold shares in ServiceNow.
