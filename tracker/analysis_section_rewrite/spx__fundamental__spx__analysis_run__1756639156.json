The current regime is driven by four catalysts: (1) Fed’s dovish tone at Jackson Hole (Aug 2025) lifted risk‑on sentiment (OGK8WLL69); (2) SEC’s Project Crypto and GENIUS Act (July 2025) reduced legal uncertainty, boosting institutional demand (CNBC article 5); (3) Bitmine Immersion’s $45 M treasury purchase (Aug 2025) added institutional weight (OGK8WLL69); (4) Trump’s executive order on crypto in retirement plans (Jan 2025) opened long‑term inflows (CNBC article 3). Key risks: regulatory crackdown (CNBC article 5), macro risk‑off (CNBC article 6), and competition from alternative chains (CNBC article 7). Confidence is moderate‑high, contingent on Fed policy and regulatory stability.",
