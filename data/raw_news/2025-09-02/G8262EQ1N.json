  "title": "Goldman\u2019s Kaplan on Fed Independence and Policy",
  "description": "Rob Kaplan, Vice Chairman at Goldman Sachs and former Dallas Fed President, discusses the outlook for central bank policy and independence. He speaks with Avril Hong from the sidelines of the \u201cGoldman Sachs Asia Leaders Conference\u201d in Hong Kong. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "So let's start with the latest. We're hearing reports that the treasury secretary could begin in his Fed chair as soon as this week. Who, in your mind do you want to see taking over from Chairman Powell? I'm not I'm not going to comment on individual candidates, obviously. But Jay Powell term as chairman ends in May. And so it makes sense that they should start the interview process. I think the main thing for the leader, the next leader of the Fed, has to be somebody who has strong grounding in economics and can make independent judgments about the economy, can forge a consensus, can oversee the Fed and manage it, and can operate, in my view, in a independent manner to make the best decisions for the U.S. economy. An independent central bank is something you've cited previously as being the mark of a successful nation. We've seen Trump ramping up pressure on Powell moving to fire, Lisa Cook moving as well, potentially to get a majority on the board. How worrying is that for you? Well, I won't comment on those individual situations, but I do think, as you've said, it's critical that the people that are in the governors seats and then the bank president seats operate without regard to political influence or political considerations and divorce themselves from worrying about political pressure. They have to make the best decisions they can. They can debate. They can disagree. They can bring innovative ideas. But it's got to be done on the basis of what they think is the best decision for the U.S. economy. And I think it's critical that that ethic I think it's in the interest of the United States for that ethic to be maintained. They're under a lot of pressure, though. How do you think they can work with these constraints? How might that shape policymaking between now and potentially in May? So the best way to deal with these pressures, if I'm at the Fed, is to ignore them and to focus on the job. And I would right now be focusing on my team on the decision for the September meeting. And it's it's not completely clear the job market. On the one hand, we're at full employment, but we think hiring is slowed to stall speed. We'll see what the jobs report is Friday. So that's on one side. But inflation is above target and that's before considering the tariffs. Service sector inflation is is still very sticky. And so I'd be focusing my team on making the best decision in September. I personally would be leaning toward cutting in September, but I doubt it will be the start of a rate cutting cycle. I think they'll take it one meeting at a time. But but those crosscurrents are complicated enough. I would I'd make sure if I were at the Fed, keep my team focused on the issue at hand and doing our job. Do you see strength in the labor market? You were talking during the break about some of these structural changes underway. You know, how is that going to affect. So GDP growth in the United States is is solid but somewhat sluggish. We started the year thinking GDP growth. The United States might be two quarter two and a half percent. I think our best judgment at Goldman Sachs now, it's more likely to be closer to one and a half percent. So and why is that? Number one, the tariffs, at least in the short run and the uncertainty have slowed growth. The second thing that's slow growth is labor force. We are curtailing labor force supply. There are at least 10 million undocumented immigrants in the United States that are key parts of construction, agriculture, other industries that are either not reporting to work. They're not shopping. And it's creating also some stickiness and slowing in the economy. And so I think the reason the unemployment rate is so low is because supply is declining, but hiring is also very sluggish. So I think the Fed is starting to realize maybe they need to look through the headline unemployment rate and realize that even though we're still looks like we're at full employment on the surface, it's that the hiring level is very sluggish because growth is sluggish. And that would be the argument for making some adjustment to the Fed funds rate, even though inflation is still above target. It's interesting also because this is a Fed that for the most part has stuck to its guns about data dependency. What is your sense of how the BLS needs to evolve along with these structural changes that you just cited in the economy, including trade? You know, I how how does it need to. So you may know when I was at the Fed and since I've left, I've never been a fan of the term data dependency because it's a piece of the puzzle. What do I mean by that? There are bills and Commerce Department figures every month. The problem is they're back. Backward looking. They're aggregated. They tend to get revised later. So you want to look at them, but you don't want to overreact to any one data print. You also want to talk to businesses. You want to look at structural trends, you want to look at the whole mosaic. And but in that regard, to your point, it's critical that the Fed still rely on BLS information. But give me give you an example. We've got a significant API data center power boom going on in the United States. It will be disruptive to many industries, but disruptive in a constructive way that will increase productivity growth that's disinflationary. We haven't seen that quite yet show up in the data, but they think it will. And so even though inflation's running above target, that structural driver has to be taken into account because it's one reason why inflation may moderate. And that's a good example. When you're at the Fed, you want to look at data, but you want to look at the whole picture, including structural drivers in forming a judgment. That's really interesting because you talk about these crosscurrents. They include for the inflationary outlook. And this is coming at a time when we still might not have seen fully the impact from tariffs. That's right. What is your sense of is that going to be coming, you know, a one off or more in waves? Well, we're we're going to find out. And there's that still somewhat in flux. But we do know the following Before even considering tariffs, as I said, service sector inflation is still sticky, but we know the following about goods. First of all, goods for the last two years have been dis inflating globally. What what's driving that? China? Overcapacity, manufacturing overcapacity? That overcapacity hasn't gone away. The tariff situation may complicate it, but I think over the horizon, global overcapacity and good and the fact that US consumers don't need to buy goods, they can shift, they can substitute, they they're price sensitive. They can decide to go to dinner instead of buying a set of goods. I think that makes me think it is more likely these tariffs will be one time more likely to be, and that it won't affect may moderate over time. That and the IBM, which is also disinflationary and also the fact that growth is sluggish, which also limits demand for goods. I think all those things make me more optimistic that maybe you'll see some moderation of the tariff impact when we look back a year from now. What did not make sense then beyond September for there to be more cuts then will those who want more cuts will argue that The truth is I mentioned crosscurrents. I think in a period where you've got crosscurrents, the best thing I think you can do is don't be a prognosticator, be a risk manager, and that means take it one meeting at a time. So all my attention will be focused on September. After that's done, I'll wipe the slate clean and do my analysis between September and the November of the November meeting. And that's why I say I wouldn't assume this is the start of a rate cutting cycle. I think they'll shorten up the time frame and the prognostications and take it one meeting at time.",
