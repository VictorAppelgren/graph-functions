      "text": "- Excellent productivity performance\n- Battery life is great\n- Solid and attractive build\n- Decent IPS display\n- Attractive price\n- Underwhelming graphics performance\n- Battery life not as good as promised\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nWindows laptops are undergoing perhaps the most significant transformation in their history, largely spurred by Apple\u2019s successful transition from Intel chips to its Apple Silicon Arm architecture that\u2019s afforded both fast performance and industry-leading efficiency.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC is named for new AI features, but it\u2019s rolling out first on the new Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite Arm chipset that promises to challenge Apple in both performance and battery life.\nAt the same time, HP has rebranded its laptops as the OmniBook, replacing the Pavilion, Envy, and Spectre brands. The OmniBook X is HP\u2019s first Copilot+ laptop and its current Windows on Arm machine based on the Snapdragon X Elite. It\u2019s safe to say that the OmniBook X is an entirely new kind of Windows laptop. It might not defeat the MacBook Air M3 outright, but it offers a compelling alternative to the current selection of Intel and AMD laptops available right now.\nSpecs and configurations\n| HP OmniBook X | |\n| Dimensions | 12.32 inches x 8.8 inches x 0.56-0.57 inches |\n| Weight | 2.97 pounds |\n| Processor | Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 |\n| Graphics | Qualcomm Dreno |\n| RAM | 16GB |\n| Display | 14.0-inch 16:10 2.2K (2240 x 1400) IPS |\n| Storage | 512GB 1TB |\n| Touch | Yes |\n| Ports | 1 x USB-A 3.2 1 x USB-C 3.2 1 x USB4 3.5mm audio jack |\n| Wireless | Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 |\n| Webcam | 5MP with infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition |\n| Operating system | Windows 11 on Arm |\n| Battery | 59 watt-hour |\n| Price |\nBuy at HP |\nThe OmniBook X comes in just two configurations. For $1,150, you get the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14.0-inch 2.2K IPS display. For $100 more, you can upgrade to a 1TB SSD.\nThose are attractive prices for a laptop with excellent performance and very good battery life. Its most direct competitors, the Apple MacBook Air M3 and Dell XPS 13, are considerably more expensive.\nDesign\nThe big news here is the introduction of the latest Windows on Arm running on the Snapdragon X Elite, as well as the new Copilot+ AI features that, for now, run exclusively on Qualcomm\u2019s chipset. I won\u2019t be delving into AI, in part because the biggest feature \u2014 Recall \u2014 has been delayed. The rest of the features aren\u2019t unique to the OmniBook X, and aren\u2019t nearly as groundbreaking. But the features that are available today include enhanced Studio Effects, Live Captions, and Cocreator, and these features leverage the extra AI performance in the Snapdragon X Elite chipset.\nSetting all of those concerns aside, we still need to evaluate the OmniBook X as a laptop. And in this regard, it\u2019s a strong start to HP\u2019s new branding.\nTo begin with, it\u2019s well-built, with an aluminum chassis and lid that are mostly rigid \u2014 only the lid demonstrates a bit of flexing under moderate pressure. The Apple MacBook Air M3 suffers from the same thing while the Dell XPS 13 is more solid overall. These are all quality laptops, though. The OmniBook X is also reasonably thin and light, with the MacBook Air being by far the thinnest at just 0.44 inches and 2.7 pounds. The OmniBook X is 0.56 inches and 2.97 pounds and the XPS 13 is around the same thickness (0.58 inches) and is the lightest. Of course, the OmniBook X is the largest with its 14-inch display and thicker display bezels.\nAesthetically, the OmniBook X does\u2019t break any new ground. It\u2019s available in two colors, Meteor Silver and Ceramic White. I reviewed the former, and it\u2019s attractive enough with smooth edges and a keyboard that\u2019s a slightly darker color. The MacBook Air M3 has a more elegant simplicity while the XPS 13 stands out as more modern when you open the lid. But nobody will likely choose from among them based on looks alone.\nKeyboard and touchpad\nThe OmniBook X keyboard has the same comfortable layout as HP\u2019s other premium laptops, with large keycaps, lots of spacing, and bold lettering that\u2019s easy to see in all lighting conditions (including in the dark thanks to quality backlighting). The switches are snappy and precise, and they require a bit of extra force compared to some others, including the excellent Magic Keyboard on the MacBook Air. I found the keyboard a bit too firm for my tastes, but most people will probably love it.\nThe touchpad is a mechanical version, and it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s large enough, although there\u2019s room on the palm rest for it to be slightly larger. It\u2019s responsive enough and the clicks are firm but a bit loud. The MacBook Air\u2019s Force Touch haptic touchpad is much better, as is the haptic touchpad on the Spectre x360 14. I would have liked to see it used here as well.\nThe display is touch-enabled. That\u2019s a plus and something the MacBook Air doesn\u2019t offer.\nConnectivity and webcam\nConnectivity is just OK for a 14-inch laptop. You get USB4, which offers much of the advantages of Thunderbolt 4, along with a legacy port. There\u2019s no SD card reader, which is unfortunate. Wireless connectivity can be upgraded to Wi-Fi 7 for those who want to remain current for as long as possible.\nHP included its 5MP webcam, which works with the enhanced Microsoft Studio Effects AI feature for smoother backgrounds and such. That\u2019s a Copilot+ feature that exists in a presumably lesser form on the previous \u201cAI PC\u201d generation running on Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake and certain AMD chipsets. There\u2019s also an infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition. The infrared camera had a tendency to stop working during my testing and needed a system reboot to resolve. So, mark that down as an early bug that needs fixing.\nCPU performance\nThe OmniBook X Elite uses the Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 chipset. Like all Elite X versions, it has 12 cores \u2014 eight performance and four efficient. The X1E-78-100 is the slowest version, running at a maximum of 3.4GHz, where the X1E-00-1DE, for example, runs at 3.8GHz. The X1E-78-100 does not have a dual-core boost mode, where the X1E-00-1DE can boost to 4.3GHz. In addition, its Adreno GPU runs at 3.8 TFLOPS compared to 4.6 TFLOPS. The OmniBook X isn\u2019t fanless, but its fans are reasonably quiet at full throttle. The MacBook Air M3 has no fans and so is completely silent.\nThe biggest challenge with evaluating the OmniBook X\u2019s performance is the lack of benchmarks for Windows on Arm. Only a few run natively on the Arm chipset, some run in emulation, and some don\u2019t run at all. While I could poke around running various apps to see how responsive they are, this process isn\u2019t as objective as I wish it were right now. For my own part, I found the OmniBook X to be very quick during my review and as quick as comparable Intel Meteor Lake and Apple Silicon laptops while performing the same day-to-day tasks.\nLooking at Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024, both of which run natively on Arm, the OmniBook X is slightly faster than Intel Meteor Lake laptops and the MacBook Air M3 in multi-core performance. The MacBook Air M3 is faster across the board in single-core, which can matter in day-to-day performance when multitasking is at a minimum. I also ran the PCMark 10 Applications benchmark that runs in emulation on Windows on Arm, but even so the OmniBook X was faster. This is the most real-world benchmark we currently have, and it shows that the OmniBook X will be plenty fast for productivity workflows based around things like email, web browsing, and office applications. Interestingly, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x with the same chipset was a bit faster overall, which demonstrates that design still matters.\nThe bottom line \u2014 and it\u2019s significant \u2014 is that the Snapdragon X Elite chipset is must faster than previous Windows on Arm implementations. In the past, Windows on Arm imposed a significant performance penalty, and it no longer does. At the same time, contrary to some of the claims made since the new chipset was announced, I wouldn\u2019t say that the OmniBook X is significantly faster than the alternatives in the kinds of tasks these laptops will be asked to perform.\nI included scores from the MacBook Pro 16 with the M3 Max chipset to give an idea of how Apple Silicon scales by comparison. While it might seem like the 14-inch model is a better comparison, both MacBook Pros perform similarly. It\u2019s obvious that the M3 Max is a step above, even when compared with the faster Snapdragon X Elite X1E-84-100.\n| Geekbench 6 (single/multi) |\nCinebench 2024 (single/multi) |\nPCMark 10 Applications |\n|\n| HP Omnibook X (Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100) |\nBal: 2,377 / 13,561 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 101 / 749 Perf: N/A |\n12,543 |\n| Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x (Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100) |\nBal: 2,454 / 14,039 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 106 / 872 Perf: N/A |\nN/A |\n| Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge 16 (Snapdragon X Elite X1E-84-100) |\nBal: 2,957 / 15,358 Perf: 2,935 / 15,614 |\nBal: 126 / 766 Perf: 123 / 854 |\nN/A |\n| Dell XPS 13 (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\nBal: 2,109 / 11,134 Perf: 2,132 / 10,866 |\nBal: 95 / 487 Perf: 96 / 658 |\n11,346 |\n| Dell XPS 14 (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\nBal: 2,334 / 13,070 Perf: 2,344 / 12,818 |\nBal: 101 / 681 Perf: 101 / 772 |\n11,523 |\n| Asus Zenbook 14 Q425 (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\nBal: 2,257 / 11,820 Perf: 2,279 / 11,806 |\nBal: 95 / 468 Perf: 103 / 631 |\nN/A |\n| Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 9 (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\nBal: 2,396 / 14,270 Perf: 2,426 / 14,406 |\nBal: 101 / 594 Perf: 102 / 670 |\nN/A |\n| Apple MacBook Air (M3 8/10) |\nBal: 3,102 / 12,078 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 141 / 601 Perf: N/A |\nN/A |\n| Apple MacBook Pro 16 (M3 Max 16/40) |\nBal: 3,119 / 20865 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 140 / 1,667 Perf: N/A |\nN/A |\nGPU performance\nThe next question is how the Snapdragon X Elite\u2019s Adreno GPU performs. Here, we\u2019re again limited in how we can test performance, especially to compare against the MacBook Air M3. And this is important for more than just gaming, which none of the laptops at this level with integrated GPUs can do with any real performance. Microsoft and Qualcomm have talked about the platform\u2019s gaming chops, but that\u2019s a little misleading \u2014 they\u2019ve said that these Windows on Arm laptops can game as well as laptops with Intel Arc and AMD Radeon integrated graphics, but that\u2019s not a very high bar. And even then, questions abound about the platform\u2019s gaming performance even running older titles with entry-level settings.\nProbably more significant is how the Adreno GPU performs in creative apps, such as Adobe\u2019s Premiere Pro and Photoshop, that can use the GPU to speed up certain tasks. Here, the MacBook Air M3 has an advantage because of the M3 chipset\u2019s various optimizations, not so much because of its GPU cores. But consider the Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark that runs in a live version of the application.\nThe MacBook Air M3 scored 3,633 compared to the Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 9 with its Intel Arc graphics that scored just 2,349. Neither even come close to the 8,046 scored by the MacBook Pro 16 with the M3 Max chipset \u2014 of course. This benchmark won\u2019t run on Windows on Arm, but looking at these numbers, it\u2019s likely that the OmniBook X won\u2019t perform as well as the MacBook Air M3 either. Again, the MacBook isn\u2019t necessarily faster because of its GPU, but the point is that you\u2019ll still want a discrete GPU on a Windows on Arm laptop if you want to do things like video editing.\nSo, in the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme test that was designed specifically to test across integrated graphics including Windows on Arm, the OmniBook X is just slightly slower than Intel Arc (and the MacBook Air M3). In the other tests, Adreno is significantly slower. None of these scores bodes particularly well for the OmniBook\u2019s ability to run demanding creative tasks, where even the entry-level RTX 4050 on the Dell XPS 14 is much faster \u2014 and that laptop scores 3,983 in the Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark.\nThe bottom line is that the OmniBook X, along with other laptops running the Snapdragon X Elite, likely won\u2019t offer any graphical speed advantages over similar Windows laptops. None of these are viable gaming laptops, and creators should also be wary.\n| 3DMark Fire Strike |\n3DMark Time Spy |\n3DMark Wild Life Extreme |\n3DMark Steel Nomad Light |\n|\n| HP Omnibook X (Adreno) |\nBal: 5,378 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 1,810 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 5,754 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 1,953 Perf: N/A |\n| Dell XPS 13 (Intel Arc) |\nBal: 7,265 Perf: 8,583 |\nBal: 3,234 Perf: 3,897 |\nBal: 6,322 Perf: 6,667 |\nBal: 2,599 Perf: 3,005 |\n| HP Envy x360 14 (Intel Graphics) |\nN/A | Bal: 1,857 Perf: 2,052 |\nBal: 2,389 Perf: 2,524 |\nBal: 1,291 Perf: 1,490 |\n| Dell XPS 14 (RTX 4050) |\nBal: 6,854 Perf: 12,474 |\nBal: 5,438 Perf: 5,499 |\nBal: 9,056 Perf: 9,106 |\nBal: 4,940 Perf: 5,002 |\n| Apple MacBook Air (M3 8/10) |\nN/A | N/A | Bal: 8,098 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 3,378 Perf: N/A |\n| Apple MacBook Pro 14 (M3 Max 16/40) |\nN/A | N/A | Bal: 10,008 Perf: N/A |\nBal: 8,083 Perf: N/A |\nAI performance\nI would love to be able to tell you exactly how the OmniBook X performs in AI-related tasks. After all, the Snapdragon X Elite is marketed with a neural processing unit (NPU) that\u2019s significantly faster at 40 tera operations per second (TOPS) than Meteor Lake\u2019s 10 TOPS and the Apple M3\u2019s Neural Engine (NE) at 18 TOPS. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t good cross-platform benchmarks yet for the machine learning (ML) tasks underlying generative AI and large language models (LLMs).\nFor example, Geekbench ML can evaluate the NE in Apple Silicon but not in Intel or Qualcomm chipsets. And it also can\u2019t evaluate performance in ML tasks on Intel or AMD integrated GPUs, but it can test the Snapdragon X Elite\u2019s Adreno GPU, discrete GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, and the GPU cores in Apple Silicon. Finally, it can measure CPU performance in ML tasks across all of these chipsets. However, of the three components, discrete GPUs are the fastest at ML processes, NPUs are next-fastest, and CPUs are slowest.\nUL Solutions makes a suite of AI benchmarks in its Procyon tool, but I\u2019m still working out how they can be used to compare different platforms. They use components differently and AI inferences are supported differently as well. So, at this point, they\u2019re not helpful in evaluating Qualcomm\u2019s NPU.\nThe most we can say right now is that the Snapdragon X Elite is likely to be faster than Meteor Lake and Apple M3 laptops at on-device AI, to the extent that tasks use the NPU. If they use the GPU, then laptops with discrete GPUs will be significantly faster. Apple\u2019s M4 chipset, currently available in the latest iPad Pro, has an NE rated at 38 TOPS, so it should be roughly as fast at running ML tasks on-device except for any differences in ML inferences on Windows for Intel, Windows on Arm, and macOS (when the M4 rolls out on MacBooks). And then Intel has Lunar Lake and AMD\u2019s AI 300 have even faster NPUs, on paper. Stay tuned.\nBattery life\nThere\u2019s no metric that\u2019s more important for this round of Windows on Arm laptops than battery life. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Silicon MacBooks impress the most \u2014 they\u2019re not only fast but they\u2019ve offered unparalleled battery life since their introduction. Where the typical Windows laptop might not make it through a full day even running a lightweight workflow, MacBooks routinely last for multiple days. And where Windows laptops run down after a couple of hours when running demanding tasks, MacBooks can make it past lunchtime.\nThe OmniBook X has a 54 watt-hour battery, which isn\u2019t huge for a 14-inch laptop, and it equips a 2.2K IPS display, which isn\u2019t as power-hungry as the OLED displays in most of our comparison group below. The MacBook Air M3 has a 52.6 watt-hour battery and an IPS display, making for a more direct comparison. And that\u2019s the comparison that\u2019s most relevant. After all, the MacBook Air is the OmniBook X\u2019s most important target.\nAgain, we\u2019re limited in how we can test a Windows on Arm laptop. In our web browsing test, the OmniBook X lasted longer than most Meteor Lake laptops but considerably shorter than the MacBook Air M3. It wasn\u2019t a terribly impressive performance. The OmniBook X lasted longer in our video looping test, where it again did well relative to most Windows laptops, but it wasn\u2019t in another class entirely and it wasn\u2019t as strong as the MacBook Air M3.\nIt\u2019s a challenge to find a battery test to evaluate how long these laptops can run more demanding tasks. One approach was to run Cinebench 2024 multi-core with each core active. In this test, the OmniBook X lasted for roughly two hours while running at close to 100% performance, while the XPS 13 made it to 1.5 hours in performance mode. The MacBook Air M3, also running at 100%, lasted for 3.5 hours. Again, it\u2019s in another class entirely.\nTherefore, I have to conclude at this point that the MacBook Air retains its spot as much more efficient than any Windows laptop available today. Windows on Arm is certainly more efficient than current Intel chipsets. Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake promises to be its most efficient yet, and Apple\u2019s M4 could also boost its already incredible efficiency.\n| Web browsing | Video | |\n| HP Omnibook X (IPS) (Snapdragon X Elite) |\n13 hours, 37 minutes | 22 hours, 4 minutes |\n| Dell XPS 13 (OLED) (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\n7 hours, 17 minutes | 8 hours, 7 minutes |\n| Dell XPS 14 (OLED) (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\n8 hours, 16 minutes | 10 hours, 10 minutes |\n| Dell XPS 14 (IPS) (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\n11 hours, 49 minutes | 14 hours, 53 minutes |\n| Asus Zenbook 14 Q425 (OLED) (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\n12 hours, 25 minutes | 18 hours, 1 minute |\n| Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 9 (OLED) (Core Ultra 7 155H) |\n5 hours, 54 minutes | 8 hours, 21 minutes |\n| HP Envy x360 14 (OLED) (Core Ultra 7 155U) |\n7 hours, 37 minutes | 9 hours, 30 minutes |\n| Apple MacBook Air (IPS) (Apple M3) |\n19 hours, 38 minutes | N/A |\nDisplay and audio\nThe OmniBook X has one display option, a 14.0-inch 16:10 2.2K (2240 x 1400) IPS panel running at 60Hz. I found it a good enough experience for the kind of tasks I perform when putting together a review, but I\u2019ve been spoiled by so many OLED displays that provide a different kind of experience.\nMy colorimeter says that this is a good but not great IPS display. It\u2019s bright enough at 325 nits, and it has the usual IPS colors at 100% of sRGB, 78% of AdobeRGB, and 79% of DCI-P3. Those are all averages today. The colors were very accurate though at a DeltaE of 0.98. The contrast was very good for IPS at 1,400:1, which is still well below OLED\u2019s near infinite contrast.\nOverall, the display is good but not great, meeting the needs of productivity users but falling a bit short for creators and media consumers. That combines with just good enough audio provided by two downward-firing speakers that were just loud and clear enough but lacking in bass and depth.\nThe OmniBook X is a better Windows laptop\nThere\u2019s still lots of work to do in evaluating the new Windows on Arm experience. The OmniBook X held up well when considering performance and battery life when compared with Intel\u2019s current generation. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t quite take the crown from Apple Silicon, with the MacBook Air M3 being a more efficient laptop.\nThanks to a solid and attractive build quality and an attractive price, though, the OmniBook X should be on everyone\u2019s list for a new Windows laptop. We need more data to see how it compares directly to other Copilot+ PCs, such as the new Surface Laptop, but on its own, the OmniBook X is a great sign for the future of Windows on Arm."

      "text": "The 2-in-1 laptop category remains dominated by Microsoft's Surface brand, yes. There's no getting around that.\nAnd yet, in 2024, there is more competition in the 2-in-1 space than there have been in a while.\nWe've reviewed every great 2-in-1 you can buy, including Chromebooks, convertibles, and powerful 16-inch versions. The overall best 2-in-1 at the moment is the Microsoft Surface Pro 11, with its fantastic keyboard that's as easy to remove as it is to type on, a 120Hz display, and a haptic-enabled pen. There's a reason it makes our list of the overall best laptops you can buy, despite being a tablet with a detachable keyboard.\nA detachable 2-in-1 that's fully functional\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 11\n- Gorgeous OLED screen\n- Keyboard now works disconnected\n- Upgradable storage\n- Excellent trackpad and keyboard\n- Spectacular webcam\n- Great performance and battery life\n- Not a great tablet without the keyboard\n- Lacks a headphone jack\nHistorically, Microsoft slowly evolved the Surface Pro line over the years with subtle, but important tweaks. The Surface Pro 11 upends that model, switching completely over to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X chipset and Windows on Arm. It's a member of the new Microsoft Copilot+ PC initiative aimed at expanding the Windows platform's AI functionality while improving performance and battery life.\nThe Surface Pro 11 maintains the same iconic Surface Pro kickstand and Type Cover design, and so without setting it next to its predecessor, you might not notice the differences right away. But like the previous Surface Pro 9, it's made of aluminum rather than magnesium, it has smaller display bezels surrounding a larger 13-inch display (up from 12.3 inches), and its edges are more rounded. It's a more elegant and modern design that we like a lot. Differences include a new OLED display running at 120Hz and a wireless Type Cover that completely separates from the tablet.\nThe downside is that Microsoft dropped the 3.5mm audio jack, a decision that will bother some. Inside, it's powered by either the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite chipset, which offers either 10 or 12 cores and the efficiency of the Arm architecture. In our review, the Surface Pro 11 was very fast and lasted longer than previous Surface Pro 2-in-1s as well as most Intel laptops. In addition, the new OLED display option that provides bright, dynamic, and accurate colors and inky blacks.\nQuestions remain about the compatibility of Windows 11 on Arm. However, even then the new detachable tablet is the best all-around 2-in-1 you can buy today.\nThe best convertible 2-in-1\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n- Solid build quality\n- Attractive aesthetic\n- Very good battery life\n- Gorgeous OLED display\n- Excellent keyboard\n- Great haptic touchpad\n- Performance is just OK\n- Expensive list prices\nWe always loved the HP Spectre x360 14, and this year, HP rebranded and redesigned its entire laptop lineup, including its most important 14-inch 2-in-1 device. Now, the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 isn't a detachable 2-in-1 like the Surface Pro -- it's a convertible, meaning it's a laptop with a touch screen and a 360-degree hinge. You can use it as a tablet, as a laptop, in tent mode, or even flipped around backward.\nIt has a gorgeous 2.8K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and the device still weighs just under three pounds. Build quality is excellent, the keyboard and trackpad are top-notch, and battery life is strong thanks to the new Intel Core Ultra Series 2 chips onboard.\nIt's a bit thick and heavy for a tablet. There' no doubt about that. But 2-in-1 convertibles aren't meant to be held in one hand like an iPad. What they make up for in portability though, they make up for in being proper laptops -- only with a bit more adaptability.\nA Chromebook 2-in-1 that's incredibly affordable\nLenovo Chromebook Duet 3\n- Good enough productivity performance\n- Excellent battery life\n- Surprisingly good display\n- Folio kickstand and keyboard included\n- Strong value\n- Keyboard is too cramped\n- Limited to Wi-Fi 5\nThe Lenovo IdeaPad Duet is a Chromebook for people who like tablet designs and really like Chromebook prices but are still looking for the right 2-in-1 PC.\nThe slim Duet offers a 10.9-inch 2K (2000 x 1200) screen, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 CPU processor, and 4GB of RAM. Since it's a Chromebook, storage space really isn't a focus, but it's nice to see 64GB for those who need it for Android apps and Linux desktop software. Ports are limited to two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 connections, one of which is used to charge the tablet.\nWhile it's nice that the keypad includes a small touchpad for those who want it, it's still a little cramped for our taste. However, we rarely see similar specs made available at such a low price (and you can always choose a different keypad if you want to). Battery life is excellent at 11.5 hours for web browsing and 16 hours for video.\nIf you're looking for more like this, we've also gathered a list of the best Chromebooks.\nA pure tablet that works great as a laptop\nApple iPad Pro\n- Sublime OLED screen\n- Lovely design and build\n- Top-notch speakers\n- Surprisingly good battery life\n- Blistering performance\n- Excellent keyboard and stylus\n- iPadOS is achingly lacking\n- It's extremely expensive\n- Pricey accessories\nApple might not like calling the iPad Pro a \"2-in-1 laptop,\" but that's what it is. That is, so long as you pair it with the excellent Magic Keyboard attachment.\nThe iPad Pro 13 is a significant upgrade to Apple's high-end tablet. It includes a new tandem OLED display that's only factionally larger, and it uses the new Apple Silicon M4 processor that's faster, more efficient, and includes an upgraded Neural Engine. The new M4 chipset makes the iPad Pro even more evenly matched with modern laptops at many tasks, meaning that you're no longer giving up performance to enjoy a legitimate tablet format.\nThe new iPad Pro's tandem OLED display is sublime, stacking two OLED panels together to dramatically increase brightness. It has the same 120Hz refresh rate as before but adds OLED's super-fast response times, in addition to wider and more accurate colors and OLED's inky blacks. It goes up to 1,000 nits in standard dynamic range (SDR) content and up to 1,600 in high dynamic range (HDR), with a sharp 2752-by-2064 resolution in slightly larger 13.0-inch display. The new Apple Pencil Pro active pen makes for an excellent drawing tool, and the updated Magic Keyboard gives the tablet laptop-like functionality, including haptic touchpad support in the last versions of iPad OS.\nOf course, as an iPad, it remains the best tablets go. Today, the iPad Pro is the thinnest, lightest, and purest tablet experience you can buy, thanks in large part to a massive library of apps that are optimized for tablet usage.\nA tiny Windows 11 2-in-1 that shines\nMicrosoft Surface Go 3\n- Excellent build quality\n- Superior display for a budget machine\n- Great Active Pen support\n- Small and light\n- Surprisingly good real-world performance\n- Can get expensive\n- Mediocre battery life\n- Keyboard and touchpad are cramped\nWhy you should buy this: It's the best small 2-in-1.\nWho it's for: Anyone who wants a tablet that can plug in a keyboard in a pinch \u2014 and doesn't want to spend a ton of cash.\nWhy we picked the Microsoft Surface Go 3:\nAffordable and slim, the Surface Go 3 gives you a classic tablet experience with Windows 11. It's also a notable upgrade to the first Surface Go, which was a very portable tablet but not that great on heavy workloads.\nThe newer model picks up the Surface Go 2's design and slims down the bezels while increasing the screen size to 10.5 inches. It also significantly improves performance using new processor options. Our pick uses an Intel Pentium 6500Y or Core i3 chip complemented by 8GB of RAM. The fast 128GB SSD makes it easier to handle work tasks.\nThe Surface Go 3 has ports for USB-C, a hidden microSD card slot to expand storage, and a headphone jack. The battery is rated for 10 hours, an improvement on the first Go's battery life, but still doesn't impress compared to other picks on our list.\nA powerful 2-in-1 with an innovative design\nSurface Laptop Studio 2\n- Beautiful PixelSense Flow display\n- Robust hinge design\n- Comfortable keyboard and trackpad\n- Sharp webcam\n- Expensive\n- Mediocre battery life\n- Middling performance in Recommended mode\nWhy you should buy this: It\u2019s the most powerful 2-in-1.\nWho it's for: Business and creative professionals with money to spend on the best.\nWhy we picked the Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2:\nThe Surface Laptop Studio is an innovative pull-forward 2-in-1 design in an all-metal chassis with powerful components inside. It's not a direct replacement for the Surface Book 3, but it's taken its place at the top of Microsoft's Surface lineup. It's recently been updated to its second generation, with even more power inside.\nIt features 45-watt Intel H-series Core CPUs, along with an optional Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, making it the most powerful 2-in-1 in our lineup. It can handle demanding productivity workflows while managing less demanding creative tasks as well. It can also do some gaming in a pinch.\nYou'll appreciate the 14.4-inch 3:2 display at a high 2,400 x 1,600 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, and the panel supports the Microsoft Surface Slim 2 Pen's haptic feedback. With up to 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD, the Surface Laptop Studio 2 is a portable workstation in a 2-in-1 form factor.\nAn ultra-expensive foldable 2-in-1\nHP Spectre Foldable PC\n- Exquisite design\n- Solid build quality\n- Excellent foldable OLED display\n- Great keyboard\n- Plenty of usable formats\n- Above-average battery life\n- Extremely expensive\n- Tablet mode is overly large\n- Clamshell display resolution is relatively low\nWhy you should buy this: It's the best 2-in-1 for business.\nWho it's for: Businesspeople who need a portable 2-in-1 that your IT department will approve of.\nWhy we picked the HP Spectre Foldable PC:\nThere's a newer class of laptop that aims to go beyond the 2-in-1 to offer an additional mode. Dubbed 3-in-1s, laptops like the Spectre Foldable PC offer \"desktop\" mode to go with tent, media, and tablet modes.\nAs its name implies, the Spectre Foldable PC has a foldable display, specifically a 17.0-inch 3:4 OLED screen running at 2.5K (2560 x 1920) that folds down the middle. Place the detachable keyboard on top of the bottom fold and it's a clamshell laptop. And when unfolded the display can be used as a very large tablet or in the desktop mode mentioned above.\nHP's design is impeccable, and the tablet feels naturally balanced thanks to batteries that are split into each fold. The keyboard and touchpad are excellent, and the Spectre Foldable PC offers good enough productivity performance, with surprisingly good battery life. Its only real negative is its high price of $5,000, which limits its market considerably.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nA convertible 2-in-1 laptop can convert from a traditional clamshell laptop to a tablet. In some cases, it's a bit of a misnomer \u2014 360-degree convertible laptops like the HP Spectre x360 14 can also be used in tent and media modes. The keyboard is not removable.\nA detachable 2-in-1 laptop is a tablet-based device with a detachable keyboard accessory. In most cases, the keyboard is an additional cost, as seen with the Surface Pro family. You can keep the keyboard attached and flip it around so you can use the screen as a tablet.\nThe main advantage of a detachable 2-in-1 is portability \u2014 tablets are extremely thin, light, and easy to carry around. They also work the best for drawing and taking notes on the pen-enabled display. On the flip side, they tend to have less powerful hardware than convertibles.\nThe 360-degree convertible 2-in-1, on the other hand, isn't quite as handy as a detachable, but it tends to work better in clamshell laptop mode \u2014 especially when using it on the lap, where it's more stable than most detachable 2-in-1s. The hardware tends to be better due to the lack of space constraints seen with thin tablets.\nRecent 360-degree convertibles like our favorite HP Spectre x360 14 make for great clamshells \u2014 in fact, it's a great competitor to the Dell XPS 13 even if you never end up flipping the display around. Modern 2-in-1s are fast, have long battery life, and often enjoy even better displays than the typical clamshell laptop.\nIf you need the fastest gaming laptop or professional workstation that uses the most powerful CPUs and GPUs, then a 2-in-1 PC isn't for you. That's because 2-in-1s tend to be thinner and lighter because they can be used as slates. That creates some limitations in just how fast a 2-in-1 can perform compared to traditional laptops.\nTechnically, no, Apple doesn't offer the traditional 2-in-1 laptop. Its MacBooks are clamshell-only.\nHowever, Apple advertises its iPad Pro as a detachable 2-in-1, although it uses the mobile iPadOS instead of MacOS for desktops and laptops. Like Microsoft's Surface Pro, the keyboard is an accessory, which adds to the base price. And because the iPad Pro uses a mobile operating system, you can't install traditional desktop software \u2014 which is where Microsoft trumps Apple with the Surface Pro 11, for example.\nStill, Apple is improving how well the iPad works as a laptop by enabling mouse support and improved file system support in the new iPadOS.\nA big disappointment for dedicated gamers is that many 2-in-1s lack the capacity for supitemer-advanced CPUs and GPUs. You can use a 2-in-1 for gaming, but you won\u2019t get the same high-quality graphics or frame rate that you\u2019re used to on a real clamshell laptop.\nThe Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 has an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU that makes it more than fast enough for modern games at 1080p and moderately-high graphics settings.\nIf you're interested in a new notebook computer, use our laptop buying guide to help you choose the best device for your budget."

For student laptop deals, you should also think about buying a new laptop during the back-to-school season, as there will be major discounts on devices that are geared towards learning.\nThere are many other sales over the year that slash the prices of laptops, and retailers are using any holiday as a reason to do so. If you\u2019ve got your sights set on a certain laptop, check the calendar to see if the next holiday is coming up. If you can, it\u2019s highly recommended that you wait until then because there\u2019s a chance that the device\u2019s price goes lower. It may not get as cheap as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but when buying a new laptop, you should welcome any form of savings as you can use that cash towards other purchase like accessories, software, and subscriptions.\nYou should also be aware of any new laptop models that are on their way. Most brands reveal these fresh devices well ahead of their actual launch, and when that happens, their predecessors usually have their prices reduced. If you\u2019re fine with a previous-generation device \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, sometimes the gap between generations isn\u2019t that huge \u2014 then you should consider waiting for opportunities like this one.\nWhile there are lots of chances for you to get a new laptop for cheaper than usual, sometimes, you just can\u2019t wait. If the laptop that you\u2019re using already broke down, if there\u2019s an upcoming project that requires a faster device, if you need an upgrade right now, or for whatever reason, the good news is hat we\u2019ve got your back with the laptop deals that we\u2019ve gathered above. Some of these prices are close to what you can get them for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday too, so there won\u2019t be much regret if you make the purchase right now.\nHow we chose these laptop deals\nNot all laptop deals are built the same \u2014 how do you figure out which ones are worth it? To help you differentiate the good offers from the bad bargains, we followed a specific set of criteria when we chose the deals that we highlighted here. While the most important factors will be different for each person, these are the ones that everyone should be thinking about when buying a new laptop.\nValue for money\nFirst and foremost, you should be getting amazing value for the hard-earned cash that you spend on a new laptop. If you\u2019re going for a budget-friendly device, you should feel like you\u2019re getting a machine that\u2019s much more expensive, and if you\u2019re thinking about investing in a premium laptop, you shouldn\u2019t be spending more than you should for certain features. A good rule of thumb to follow is to determine how much you\u2019re willing to shell out and get the best laptop deal that you can get for it, and the ones above are excellent examples for their respective prices.\nLatest components\nYou should get the latest components as your budget allows, so the more you spend, the higher your expectation that you\u2019ll be getting the newest generation of processors and graphics cards with your new laptop. It\u2019s a huge bonus if you can get such specifications on a relatively affordable device, so you should be on the lookout for such offers. For the laptop deals that we chose, we want you to enjoy the most powerful performance that your budget allows.\nPurpose\nLaptops have varying designs, features, and specifications because they serve different purposes. A business laptop will focus on boosting your daily productivity, while a gaming laptop wants to run the best PC games without any issues. Figuring out how you\u2019ll mostly use your next laptop will greatly help in choosing the device that you should buy, as you can avoid paying for characteristics that you don\u2019t prioritize. When we chose these laptop deals, we made sure that they cater to multiple types of users, so there\u2019s surely something for you here.\nReliability\nYou wouldn\u2019t want to invest in a laptop that doesn\u2019t pass reliability tests, as a device that breaks down after just a few months is like watching money go down the drain. Going for the most trusted names in the computing industry with the laptop deals that we highlighted above helps ensure that you\u2019ll receive a durable laptop, and if something goes wrong, you\u2019ll get the necessary support for a repair or a replacement.\nPortability\nSome laptops can get pretty bulky \u2014 particularly gaming laptops and high-end workstations \u2014 but they\u2019re still more portable than lugging around an entire desktop computer setup. We don\u2019t want to burden you with unnecessary weight and size though, so we made sure that the laptops that we recommended are still capable of sliding into your backpack so that you can easily take them with you to work or school.\nHow to check you\u2019re getting a good laptop deal\nIt\u2019s easy to just pick the first laptop deals that we see when we go to any website, but we made sure to get the best offers available online. You can confirm yourself that you\u2019ll be getting good deals from any of the bargains above using tools such as CamelCamelCamel and Google Shopping Insights, which will show you the recent spikes and dips in the prices of these laptops. These tools are pretty easy to learn and utilize, so you\u2019ll be getting a nice snapshot of the pricing history of the laptop that you\u2019re interested in buying.\nWe used these tools to come up with this list of laptop deals so that you don\u2019t have to go through the process yourself, but it\u2019s not a problem if you don\u2019t want to take our word for it. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll get the same results if you look for the best bargains that are available right now, so once you\u2019re done comparing, feel free to take another look at our recommendations so that you can finally choose your next laptop. You better hurry though, because the more you delay your purchase, the higher the risk of missing out on these discounts that we\u2019ve sniffed out."

      "text": "Whether successful or not, Copilot+ PCs are a huge deal. They represent a major shift in the landscape of Windows laptops, integrating support for ARM chips and AI at a systemwide level. There\u2019s a lot at play in this new transition \u2014 and lots of room for confusion.\nHere\u2019s the best answers we have to the most important questions surrounding Copilot+ PCs.\nWhat are the hardware requirements?\nWhen it comes down to it, devices must hit the following requirements to be considered a Copilot+ PC: 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 40 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) neural processing unit (NPU). Microsoft hasn\u2019t provided specifics around things like CPU performance, battery life, and portability, but there may be standards in these regards too that we don\u2019t yet know about. Many of the massive claims in performance and battery life that make these devices true MacBook killers come from the Snapdragon X chips from Qualcomm \u2014 but ARM isn\u2019t a requirement.\nIntel and AMD have already announced support for Copilot+ PCs on future releases \u2014 specifically to produce laptops with more powerful NPUs that can meet the 40 TOPS requirement. The current generation of Meteor Lake Intel laptops, for example, are only at 10 TOPS.\nWhat AI features come with Copilot+ PCs?\nCopilot+ PCs are all about AI. However, this was one of the biggest problems with previous-gen AI PCs. They had NPUs, yes, but little to do with them.\nBut with Copilot+, that\u2019s all changed. The 40 TOPS NPU gives these new laptops plenty of AI horsepower, running efficiently in the background at all times. It\u2019s especially useful for processes that are better done on-device. The biggest new feature is Recall. Microsoft calls the feature a superpower that gives you \u201cphotographic memory,\u201d allowing you to search through everything you\u2019ve ever done on your PC using natural language. It\u2019s certainly a neat idea, though some have already raised the obvious privacy concerns that it brings.\nOther AI features include Copilot suggestions in settings, real-time translation, one-click replies to notifications, and more.\nThe only new AI feature planned in this Windows 11 update for non-Copilot+ PCs is a new version of the Copilot app. Rather than as a sidebar, it can now go full screen and be manipulated like a real desktop app. Microsoft did say that GPT-4o would soon be coming to Copilot, but didn\u2019t announce specifics.\nWhat devices have been announced?\nCopilot+ includes many of the major laptop manufacturers, including Dell, HP, Asus, Acer, Samsung, and Surface. They range in price between $999 and $1,699, depending on configuration options.\nSome of these devices, such as the HP Omnibook X 14, are completely new designs made for this transition. Other options like the XPS 13 use an identical chassis to their Intel counterpart, while the new Surface Laptop is in-between, making some tweaks to the design without starting from scratch.\nThere are upwards of a dozen Copilot+ PCs announced so far, with more likely coming in the future.\nWhen are the first Copilot+ PCs coming out?\nA swath of Copilot+ PCs are due out on June 18. The first of them are all available to buy right now, including the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro.\nWill the ARM transition actually work this time?\nIt certainly seems so. Microsoft has reengineered Windows to play nice with ARM, including creating a new kernel, compiler, and set of schedulers to optimize the CPU performance of these chips. They\u2019re tuned directly to the chip itself too.\nThe larger issue, of course, is around app optimization, right? We all remember the debacle with this in previous attempts to support ARM Windows laptops. But this time, it seems like Microsoft has really done the work, having reached out to 300 software vendors in the buildup to this launch. The result is that a lot of the big names have recompiled their apps for ARM, including Zoom, Dropbox, Adobe Lightroom, and yes, Google Chrome. A few missing apps like Slack and Discord are glaring, but Microsoft says it expects 90% of user time to be on native apps.\nFor the rest, Microsoft has a new emulator called Prism, which it says is as efficient as Apple\u2019s Rosetta 2. App combability certainly feels like it\u2019s at the point where it\u2019s become a nonissue.\nIs performance and battery really that good?\nAgain, it certainly seems so. Microsoft has made some ambitious claims about the performance and battery life of these new Copilot+ PCs, all thanks to what Qualcomm has achieved with its new Snapdragon X series of chips. Microsoft wants to talk all about the 40 TOPS of its NPU, but if you\u2019re buying a laptop, you\u2019ll probably be far more interested in the CPU performance and battery life.\nAcross all these new laptops, we should be seeing around 16% faster multi-threaded performance against the M3 MacBook Air. The more important metric is the claimed 46% lead in sustained performance. It should be noted that the MacBook Air is fanless, while none of these Copilot+ laptops are. Still, the increase in performance is notable and was observed in a briefing across both benchmarks and applications, including Cinebench R24, Handrake, Photoshop, and Geekbench 6.\nThe battery life claims are perhaps an even bigger deal, with up to a claimed 22 hours of local video playback on some of these devices. There will certainly be variation between devices based on displays, battery sizes, and thermals, but these laptops have clearly made a huge jump over what you can currently buy in terms of Windows laptops. We\u2019ll have to do independent testing of our own, of course, but it certainly seems like these devices are as efficient as MacBooks."

      "text": "Tablets are great for portability, they don\u2019t always have the same sort of power that you\u2019d find on a laptop, and if you grab yourself a 2-in-1, then you\u2019ll get pretty close to a tablet in terms of usability. While 2-in-1 laptops are heavier than tablets, they can give you a similar experience while packing a lot of punch under the hood, making 2-in-1 laptops the perfect middle ground. You also get a lot of 2-in-1 laptops with variable specs under the hood, depending on what you need, and some of them even show up on lists of the best laptops on the market, so you\u2019re not giving up on specs if you don\u2019t want to. Of course, some of the best 2-in-1 laptops can get quite expensive, especially when you\u2019re buying them from some of the best laptop brands out there.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone out and looked for our favorite 2-in-1 laptop deals to help save you some effort. We\u2019ve pulled from HP laptop deals, Dell laptop deals, the classic 2-in-1 Surface Pro deals, and more.\nHP Envy 2-in-1 \u2014 $800 $1,170 32% off\nThe 16-inch HP Envy 2-in-1 looks fairly ordinary at first, but opens way beyond the 120 degrees or so that you\u2019re used to, flipping its screen all the way around back. When completely flipped to the bottom, you then control the laptop with the included HP USB-C rechargeable MPP2.0 Tilt Natural Silver Pen. This version of the HP Envy 2-in-1 comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 under the hood, which is a mid-to-high-end CPU that\u2019s perfect for pretty much most uses. You also get a 1TB SSD to work with and a very reasonable 16GB of RAM so that you don\u2019t have to manage your apps and tabs constantly.\n14-inch HP Spectre x360 (refurbished) \u2014 $1,099 $1,500 27% off\nThe HP Spectre x360 is a 2-in-1 that feels solidly constructed and doesn\u2019t skimp on quality physical components in the face of getting the 2-in-1 shape right. As our HP Spectre x360 16 review will make clear, that can mean that the tablet mode feels heavy at times, but that shouldn\u2019t scare you away too much. This is a 2-in-1 made for the long term or, to quote our hands-on review, \u201cshould last for years of abuse.\u201d This model has 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and uses an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor.\nHP Pavilion 2-in-1 \u2014 $650 $900 27% off\nThe HP Pavilion 2-in-1 is an excellent entry-level convertible laptop, especially since you can get it for a little under $700. Luckily, you do get some mid-range hardware, such as the Intel Core 7 CPU, 16GB of RAM that isn\u2019t too bad, and 256GB of storage should be enough for most folks who stream most of their content. Of course, you also get a 14-inch touchscreen, which is great if you want a laptop that can function in tablet mode, and a fingerprint reader, which can come in very handy if you need that extra level of authentication.\nAsus Chromebook Plus 2-in-1 14 \u2014 $330 $400 18% off\nOne advantage of going with a Chromebook is that ChromeOS is much less resource intensive, so you can run slightly less powerful hardware, such as the mid-range AMD Ryzen 3 7320C. That should be more than enough for general day-to-day work, as well as getting some productivity work done as well, and the 8GB of RAM should give you a relatively smooth experience. Also, one big positive of using ChromeOS is that it\u2019s great for those who are already in the Google ecosystem, although its worth noting that not all Windows app will be available on ChromeOS, so double-check that your important apps are.\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 \u2014 $1,750 $2,100 17% off\nThe very recently released Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 has insane stats and a highly convenient folding mechanism that allows the touchpad to be visible at the same time as its screen. It has a 14.4-inch screen, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It runs with an Intel Core i7-13700H processor. Our Surface Laptop Studio 2 review gave a lot of attention to the special PixelSense Flow display, which is only a small upgrade over the previous version\u2019s display but will look great for anyone who isn\u2019t changing laptops every time a new model hits the shelves.\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 360 \u2014 $1,150 $1,350 15% off\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Book5 360 brings \u2014 with the exception of the graphics card \u2014 premium hardware to make a quality, touchable (and pen-able, if you purchase an S Pen separately) 2-in-1 suitable for creatives and workers alike. It runs on 16GB of RAM with an Intel Core 7 Ultra processor. You\u2019ll have 512GB of SSD storage, but there is also a microSD port (in addition to Thunderbolt 4 and USB-C ports) to give you ample room to store and manipulate video, artwork, and whatever other files you\u2019ll need for work, hobbies, and recreation.\nMore 2-in-1 Laptop Deals We Like\nIf the above deals aren\u2019t the right match for you, there are a few other 2-in-1 laptop deals you can opt for:\n-\nDell Inspiron 14 2-in-1\n\u2014 $700\n$1,0030% off -\nGalaxy Book4 Ultra\n\u2014 $2,500\n$3,00017% off"

      "text": "There is always going to be a big divide between macOS and Windows. Much of it has to do with the functional disparities that are deeply ingrained at an OS-level. Or if you dive into the heated community debates, you will see it broadly as a battle between seamlessness and flexibility.\nGaming remains the guiding star for Windows adherents. A handful of highly specialized niche industry tools also remain locked to the Microsoft platform. On the other hand, macOS fans swear by the fluid software, plenty of firepower options in the M-series silicon era, and fantastic hardware.\nBut you can\u2019t realistically compare an \u201centry-level\u201d Apple laptop at $999 with a Windows laptop half that price and non-comparable innards. To put it in simpler terms, the gulf is here to stay. But in the past year or so, a leveling tool has arrived, riding atop the AI wave. Some of it is tremendously hyped, while a few others are genuinely useful.\nAI: From hype to utility\nMicrosoft refers to its generative AI vehicle as Copilot, while Apple ships it under the Apple Intelligence bundle. Apple Intelligence on macOS has been meh, at best, and severely lacking vis-a-vis the Copilot competition.\nSo far, people who haven\u2019t embraced it in their workflow aren\u2019t bothered by it, but enterprises are adopting it rapidly. Analysts, on the other hand, are calling AI efforts one of Apple\u2019s biggest flubs so far. Internal management changes and leaks certainly paint a picture of panic.\nBut what matters to an average user is the experience they get today, and that\u2019s where Microsoft has a huge upper hand. The company\u2019s Office 365 productivity suite has already been juiced up on Copilot. Such is the enthusiasm that even the good \u2018ol MS-Paint has received AI image generation tools.\nYou can\u2019t open a mainstream Microsoft software today, and not see Copilot. Beyond the expectedly obvious stuffing across the board, there is some serious utility to be drawn from the AI stack.\nIn Word, it lives as an ever-helpful writing assistant for creative and brainstorming processes. PowerPoint users can summon it for making cool presentations with a text prompt, while in Excel, it turns data visualization into a cakewalk. We are merely scratching the surface here\nBarely a few weeks ago, Microsoft 365 Copilot landed an AI Researcher tool that can scrape the internet as well as internal documents to compile comprehensive reports. Emails, chats, internal meeting logs, calendars, transcripts, and shared documents \u2013 it can process it all to handle your queries.\nOutlook and Teams already have AI agents to automate chores such as meeting recaps, summarizing conversations, and more. It can summarize emails, offer translation, and create a to-do list after a meeting. Copilot, however, truly came into shape earlier this month at Microsoft\u2019s AI event, where it unleashed over half a dozen cutting-edge updates.\nCopilot\u2019s Memory upgrade allows it to remember and evolve through time. Actions is essentially an AI agent that saves you the drudgery of web browsing and lets an AI handle tasks like booking tickets or buying gifts. The likes of Expedia, Booking.com, and Skyscanner are already onboard.\nNotably, Copilot now has Vision capability. It can understand what\u2019s appearing on the screen, and if there\u2019s a camera available, it will also make sense of the world around you. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to use Copilot to search, change settings, organize files and collaborate on projects without switching between files or apps,\u201d says Microsoft.\nWith Pages, Copilot will bring all your random and scattered notes into one place. It can also turn any material you push into a personalized podcast, a feature that I\u2019ve used extensively and found to be surprisingly useful. Copilot can also remotely control your phone from the connected PC.\nThe truly next-gen facilities are Deep Research and Recall. Deep Research is like a personal assistant that can create custom research files, saving you hours of tedious web search work. I love it. Recall, though controversial, is like a persistent memory screenshot tool that lets you access your PC activity like a time machine.\nYou may not find all of it practically rewarding. But that\u2019s not the point, and neither is it a realistic goalpost. If you find one or two useful bits in a whole stack, that\u2019s still a positive outcome. Macs are yet to offer any of those conveniences natively.\nThe best macOS integration is currently tied to ChatGPT, and its best features require an internet connection. Apple\u2019s Macs are definitely ready, and obviously overpowered, but macOS simply lacks an in-house AI package to get the best out of it. That brings us to the topic of \u2026\nA hardware level-up for Windows\nA recurring theme in the Windows vs Mac debate is reliability and performance fluidity. To an extent, it\u2019s accurate, primarily because Apple has a uniquely tight control over the hardware and the software stack. I have often found MacBooks perform more smoothly compared to a Windows laptop with identical hardware specs.\nOn paper, that is. Copilot has offered Microsoft an opportunity to serve a Windows performance boost that can stand toe-to-toe with macOS machines. Or at least, the MacBooks. That secret sauce is the Copilot+ range of PCs. Think of it as Intel\u2019s Evo badge, but created by Microsoft in the age of AI.\nFor a machine to qualify as a Copilot+ PC, it needs a minimum 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an AI accelerator chip (NPU) that delivers at least 40 TOPS output. The latter was a high benchmark. So high, in fact, that Intel and AMD only managed to reach that baseline late last year.\nQualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X series chips remained the only option for a while that could match that NPU performance criteria. For comparison, Apple\u2019s M4 can only manage 38 TOPS at AI workflows. But it\u2019s not just AI performance where Copilot+ machines are leveling up.\nLooking at the NPU requirement from another perspective, it has forced the likes of Intel and AMD to accordingly upgrade their CPU and GPU stack for the Copilot+ platform. And to ensure that these powerful processors don\u2019t run into a bottleneck, OEMs are putting faster storage and memory chips inside their Copilot+ PCs.\nThink of it as a reversing feedback loop, but one that is only pushing the cause of Windows laptops into a new territory, and one where consistently high performance and premium experience are guaranteed. Our own tests validate those incremental hardware enhancements.\nThe Surface Laptop (7th Edition) won high praise in Digital Trends\u2019 review, eclipsing the comparable MacBook Air\u2019s multi-core performance and battery life figures. That\u2019s no small feat, especially when both laptops are evenly matched at their $999 asking price.\nDell\u2019s XPS 13 yielded similar results in our review, racing past the MacBook Air at a handful of benchmarks and in our video test. My own experience with the XPS 13 was fantastic, though it has a few lingering hardware problems that Dell has finally decided to fix with its overhauled portfolio in 2025.\nA slow, but promising start\nThe Copilot AI stack is not a magical pill to redeem Windows, but with the Copilot ecosystem, Microsoft at least has a capable hardware platform to experiment and deliver next-gen OS features. To its advantage, even the Windows on Arm platform is pretty encouraging for games.\nSo far, the biggest problem with Windows machines has been fragmentation. Unlike Apple, Microsoft has taken a near-universal approach to serving the core Windows experience on all machines, irrespective of whether it has a fire-breathing processor or if it\u2019s just a cheap school-bound laptop with a low-power AMD Ryzen APU inside.\nThe latter is a recipe for OS frustrations, but one that Copilot+ erases at a certain price premium.\nMicrosoft will also face a considerable challenge in hawking Copilot to its expansive community. A quick look at Reddit and Microsoft forums suggests that Copilot is a deeply divisive topic, and not everyone is happy with the AI stuffing within Windows.\nIt likely won\u2019t fix the fundamental OS gaps where Windows lags behind macOS.\nWhat Copilot offers is an opportunity to create standout computing experiences that focus more on practical benefits than flashy presentations. AI has its own set of inherent problems, so there\u2019s that. But the sum total of all the development so far is that Copilot is changing the Windows experience in nearly all corners.\nIt may look the same, but functionally, there is a lot of new stuff to explore. And a few of them are quite useful. Having a reliably powerful (and nearly price-matched) hardware platform with Copilot+ is what Microsoft needs to edge ahead of the venerable Mac aura. It\u2019s not impossible, but definitely worth a thoughtful attempt."

      "text": "Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC initiative has been a smash hit, with many of them landing among the best laptops, but not for the AI hardware inside. Now, finally, Microsoft is putting the neural processing unit (NPU) inside Copilot+ PCs to good use. Starting today and going throughout the next two months, Microsoft will begin rolling out the 24H2 update for all Windows 11 PCs, and in the process, unlock several features for Copilot+ PCs, including the highly controversial Recall.\nRecall is definitely the star of the show here, which will start showing up on Copilot+ laptops with a Snapdragon X chipset throughout October. Last week, Microsoft laid the groundwork for the release of Recall, detailing the security architecture of the feature and addressing some major criticisms of it. Now, for example, Recall is turned off instead of on by default. Microsoft is also allowing users to filter websites and giving users more control over their snapshots, including deleting them all.\nAlthough Snapdragon X laptops are getting the feature first, Microsoft reiterated that Intel- and AMD-based Copilot+ PCs like the Asus Zenbook S 16 will get Recall (and other Copilot+ features) starting in November. Microsoft previously announced Copilot+ availability for these PCs, though it still hasn\u2019t given a firm date as to when the free Windows updates will start rolling out.\nNew features in Paint and Photos\nWe\u2019ll finally have the base features of Copilot+ PCs all together, but Microsoft is already pushing ahead. Starting off, Microsoft is adding more features to its Photos and Paint apps. In Photos, you\u2019ll now be able to use AI-powered super resolution to increase the resolution of low-quality images. This all happens on the NPU in a matter of seconds, similar to AI-powered upscaling apps like the open-source Upscayl.\nIn Paint, Microsoft is adding generative fill and erase. This allows you to draw on an image to delete distracting objects, or add new objects based on a prompt. This has been one of the biggest additions to Photoshop over the past several months, and now it\u2019s available through an app included with every Windows 11 installation.\nAI-powered Windows search\nThese new apps are ready to go, but Microsoft has a couple of other Copilot+ features it\u2019s still working on. For starters, there\u2019s an improved Windows search coming to Copilot+ PCs. Initially, it will only work in File Explorer, and it allows you to search up files by describing them rather than matching their file name. For instance, you can search for photos that have a particular subject \u2014 Microsoft used barbecue as an example \u2014 even if the file name doesn\u2019t include those details.\nMicrosoft says it\u2019s expanding this AI-powered searching to the Settings app and the general Windows search \u201cover the coming months.\u201d With it, you\u2019ll be able to search for settings and files by describing them. Microsoft provided the example of pairing your headphones. Instead of searching for Bluetooth settings, you\u2019ll be able to search for \u201cpair my headphones,\u201d and the AI-powered search will pull up your Bluetooth settings.\nClick to Do\nFinally, Microsoft is introducing a new feature into a preview state called Click to Do. You can access it on Copilot+ PCs by holding the Windows key and clicking with your mouse anywhere on your screen. The NPU analyzes what\u2019s on your screen and provides context-aware actions in a menu. For instance, if you click on an image, you\u2019ll see an option to search Bing for the image or remove an object with Paint. And if you click on text, you\u2019ll see options to summarize or open a word processor.\nMicrosoft says the actions in Click to Do expand even further, allowing you to send an email, open a website, search the internet, and more from the Click to Do menu. Given that this feature is a preview, you shouldn\u2019t expect a ton of options out of the gate.
