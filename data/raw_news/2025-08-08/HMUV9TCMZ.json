  "title": "Woman who was diagnosed with stomach cancer aged 31 shares three symptoms",
  "description": "Alex Jade was diagnosed with stage 4 gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, in November 2022, and is now sharing her story online, including the symptoms which first made her get checked.",
  "content": "Alex Jade was stunned when doctors diagnosed her with gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, at just 31 years old in November 2022. She's now sharing her experience online, revealing the warning signs that prompted her to seek medical attention. According to Cancer Research UK, stomach cancer occurs when \"abnormal cells in the stomach start to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way\". Signs include trouble swallowing, losing weight and indigestion, though you should consult your GP if you notice any bodily changes that seem unusual for you. In a recent TikTok video on her @alexjade2 account, Alex shared footage from November 2023 detailing her diagnosis and the three warning signs she experienced.\n\nShe had initially been \"too nervous\" to share it, and is now, three years after first noticing symptoms, \"living and healing with stage 4 gastric cancer\". Alex began experiencing symptoms in April 2022. After eating and going to bed, she suffered \"terrible\" heartburn and felt extremely full, which caused her to be sick. Throughout that month she endured severe stomach pains and continued having \"very bad heartburn\", particularly after meals but also upon waking. She also experienced neck and back pain, which coincided with the stomach pains and heartburn. Initially, Alex brushed it off as gallstones and arranged for an imaging appointment to investigate. However, when the scan revealed no signs of gallstones, her GP suggested she might be suffering from GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease), prescribing medication and recommending a diet change. The medication alleviated her symptoms, but when she went to refill her prescription, the doctor advised more lifestyle changes and suggested trying over-the-counter medication, as the prescribed drugs were not intended for long-term use.\n\nHowever, her symptoms returned in full force, leaving her \"so exhausted\", vomiting and feeling constantly full. She eventually scheduled an endoscopy and colonoscopy to identify the root cause of her problems. Doctors discovered a \"huge ulcer\", but needed to conduct a biopsy to rule out cancer. A few days later, in November 2022, Alex received the heartbreaking news that she had stage 4 gastric cancer. Further tests revealed the cancer had spread to the lining of her abdomen, with \"cancerous fluid\" present and \"lymph node involvement\". What are the symptoms of gastric cancer?\n\nAccording to the NHS, gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, is a type of cancer that can occur anywhere within the stomach, a key component of the digestive system. The severity of this condition depends on the size of the cancer, whether it has spread and your overall health. There are many possible symptoms of stomach cancer, but they can be hard to spot. The NHS reports they can affect your digestion, such as:\n\u2022 Symptoms of indigestion, such as burping a lot\n\u2022 Loss of appetite of losing weight without trying to\n\u2022 A lump at the top of your tummy\n\u2022 Pain at the top of your tummy\n\u2022 Feeling tired or having no energy It's important to remember that these symptoms might be caused by other things, but it's important to get them checked by a GP.",
