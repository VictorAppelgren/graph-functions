  "title": "McCoy Global (TSE:MCB) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of CA$0.025",
  "description": "The board of McCoy Global Inc. ( TSE:MCB ) has announced that it will pay a dividend of CA$0.025 per share on the 15th...",
  "content": "The board of McCoy Global Inc. (TSE:MCB) has announced that it will pay a dividend of CA$0.025 per share on the 15th of October. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 3.2%, which is around the industry average.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nMcCoy Global's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Based on the last payment, McCoy Global was paying only paying out a fraction of earnings, but the payment was a massive 130% of cash flows. A cash payout ratio this high could put the dividend under pressure and force the company to reduce it in the future if it were to run into tough times.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share could rise by 27.9% over the next year if the trend from the last few years continues. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was CA$0.20 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was CA$0.10. This works out to be a decline of approximately 6.7% per year over that time. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nDividends have been going in the wrong direction, so we definitely want to see a different trend in the earnings per share. McCoy Global has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 28% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.\n\nOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We don't think McCoy Global is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for McCoy Global that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

  "argos_summary": "McCoy Global Inc. (TSE:MCB) announced a CA$0.025 dividend, giving a 3.2% yield that sits near the industry average. The payout ratio is high on cash flow (130%) but earnings coverage is solid, and EPS is projected to grow 27.9% next year, potentially bringing the payout ratio to a sustainable 25%. Historically the dividend has been declining, and the company has cut it at least once in the past decade, raising concerns for income\u2011focused investors. Overall, the stock offers modest yield and good earnings health but is not considered a top dividend play due to its volatile dividend history and high cash payout pressure.",
