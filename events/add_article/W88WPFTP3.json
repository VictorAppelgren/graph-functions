      "summary": "Trump’s August 29 executive order eliminates the $800 de‑minimis duty‑free threshold, imposing tariffs and customs duties on all U.S. imports below that value. The change hits a wide range of small‑parcel goods—from planners and Lego parts to e‑commerce items from Shein, Temu, and Amazon Haul—raising costs by roughly 15–50% and prompting European postal operators to suspend shipments. Retailers such as SSENSE and Lego have already paused U.S. orders, while consumers face higher fees and longer delivery times. The policy is expected to reduce the volume of low‑value imports by 1–2 billion dollars annually and could push up U.S. consumer prices by 5–10 % over the next year.",
