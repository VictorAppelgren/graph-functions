  "content": "Leigh-Anne Pinnock sent temperatures soaring as she delivered a show-stopping performance at Boardmasters Festival on Friday.\n\nThe former Little Mix star, 32, commanded the stage in a daring red, green and black bikini-style top teamed with a fringed black mini skirt layered over tie-dye yellow hot pants.\n\nThe singer, who is carving out a sizzling solo career, completed the eye-popping look with fingerless green gloves, bright red Puma trainers and strands of ribbon flowing from her outfit in the colours of the Jamaican flag.\n\nClutching a bold red microphone, she strutted and danced energetically across the stage, whipping up the crowd with her fierce moves and commanding stage presence.\n\nWith her trademark curly hair tumbling freely over her shoulders, Leigh-Anne oozed confidence as she struck powerful poses mid-song, keeping the audience captivated from start to finish.\n\nThe OMG hitmaker has been gearing up to release brand-new music, after she revealed she had left record label Warner Music Group.\n\nLeigh-Anne signed with Warner as a solo artist in 2022 and released her EP, No Hard Feelings, the following year.\n\nBut her solo career stalled after Warner 'wouldn't pay for a music video' for her last single after she reportedly 'failed to impress' with her other tracks.\n\nMore than a year later, Leigh-Anne revealed she was returning to music this summer - but had gone independent.\n\nPosting on her TikTok, Leigh-Anne said: 'It's been a bit of a weird time, going through some stuff with my current label. It's a whole thing.\n\n'I couldn't really say anything as well, so it seemed a bit \"Where's Leigh-Anne? Where's the music? What's going on?\" And I felt I couldn't really explain what was actually happening.'\n\nShe explained: 'Obviously I left my label and I'm now with Virgin. I'm fully independent guys eek! Like honestly, it's been the most amazing thing foor me, I think, I feel like it needed to happen to be honest.\n\n'You think I've been in this industry for how long now? What's the point doing it if I'm not doing it my way? It just doesn't make sense, so that's all positive now and I feel really excited and really good.'\n\nIt comes after the singer looked every inch of the doting mum as she posed for a very sweet family photoshoot with husband Andre Gray and their two twins daughters.\n\nThe singer posted a carousel of Instagram snaps during their lavish holiday, covering her daughters' faces with a green heart emoji.\n\nThe family were captured looking joyful as the little ones, three, were playing around in the stunning park.\n\nLeigh-Anne and the footballer, also 33, couldn't keep their hands off one another as they put on a smitten display in one snap.\n\nThe proud parents were then snapped holding hands with each one of the twin and giving them a gentle look.\n\n'Did one of those cheesy family photoshoots on our hols girls of course loved every second,' she captioned her latest post.",
