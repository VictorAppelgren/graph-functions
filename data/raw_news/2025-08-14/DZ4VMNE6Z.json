  "title": "This Gen-Z Founder Turned Her Side Hustle Into a $10 Million Brand\u2014and Made Paige DeSorbo a Fan",
  "description": "Gia Mezz, founder of clothing brand Leau, taught herself paid marketing on a bootstrapped budget.",
  "content": "With about $20,000 of her savings, Gia Mezz launched her clothing brand, Leau, as a self-funded side hustle in June 2020. But for the first few months, she kept her burgeoning e-commerce business a secret. Feeling weighed down by imposter syndrome and worried she might fail as a first-time founder in her mid-20s, Mezz didn\u2019t tell her friends or even her mom about what she was working on. Instead, she just kept plugging away at her day job at a fashion startup in Los Angeles. Then, one conversation at work proved she was on to something.\n\nOne of Mezz\u2019s co-workers sent her a message, she recalls: \u201cI keep seeing this brand come across my Instagram ads. I\u2019m looking for a dress. What do you think?\u201d It was from her brand.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was just so crazy,\u201d says Mezz, now 29. \u201cI was doing something right.\u201d Digital ads gradually fallen out of favor since the infamous 2021 Apple iOS update restricted brands\u2019 ability to use third-party cookies to track consumers for advertising purposes. That change made it far more costly for brands to see any positive impact from social media ads\u2014much less the same impact they saw pre-update. As digital marketing costs have kept climbing, companies have been strapped by shrinking budgets and mandates to find more places to cut.\n\n\n\nThis has not phased Mezz. Digital ads have remained a growth engine for Leau, which primarily spends on Google, Meta, Pinterest, and, increasingly, TikTok. The strategy requires a hefty upfront cost. Mezz estimates she spent over $100,000 on digital ads during her first year of business alone, floating those charges on her American Express card.\n\nStill, the investment has paid off. Leau, which has grown to five employees, including Mezz\u2019s mom and stepfather, is profitable and has exceeded $10 million in lifetime sales. This year, the clothing company has already surpassed $3.1 million in revenue and expects to finish the year around $5 million. After paying off her credit card bill and producing the next batch of dresses, blazers, corsets, and tops, the rest of that money goes straight back into Leaus\u2019s digital advertising budget. \u201cI used myself as a baseline of who to target,\u201d says Mezz, who says she taught herself how to use the platforms\u2019 ad systems through free tutorials on YouTube and through incremental trial and error experimentation, seeing what resonated with shoppers\u2014and what didn\u2019t. \u201cAt the beginning, I started off with $5 here, $5 there, and I just kept doubling my budgets, which I think really contributed to scaling the brand so fast.\u201d That ad strategy even hooked Paige DeSorbo. The former Bravo star turned podcaster turned entrepreneur, who launched her sleepwear and loungewear brand Daphne earlier this summer, discovered Leau from an Instagram ad. DeSorbo, who is known for her love of fashion, bought three items, and then posted about her haul on her Instagram story, tagging Leau in the video.",
