  "title": "B-1 bombers, NATO fighters fly over Latvia to show unified force",
  "description": "The B-1s were joined by Gripen fighters from NATO allies Hungary and Sweden during their flyover of Latvia, which lies to the west of Russia.",
  "content": "A pair of deployed B-1B Lancer bombers conducted a flyover of the capital city of Latvia alongside NATO allies in a show of force on Tuesday.\n\nThe B-1s flew in formation above the Monument of Freedom in Riga \u2014 for Latvians, a symbol of national unity and independence \u2014 alongside four JAS 39 Gripen fighters, two from Hungary and two from Sweden. Three B-1s in total deployed from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas to \u00d8rland Air Base in Norway on Aug. 9 as part of a bomber task force mission with the 345th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron.\n\nThe Air Force said in a release that the flyover is meant to show integration with allies, and how that cooperation has been strengthened through training deployments.\n\n\u201cThe security of the Baltic states and NATO\u2019s Eastern flank is the cornerstone of the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic region,\u201d said Latvian defense minister Andris Spr\u016bds. \u201cSuch U.S. and allied flyover maneuvers clearly demonstrate NATO\u2019s presence in the region, transatlantic unity and commitment to collectively strengthen the security of the Baltic State region.\u201d\n\nAs part of the B-1s\u2019 bomber task force deployment, they have integrated with the air forces of Norway and other allied nations to practice advanced tactics together, share threat information in real time and ensure they can continue to move freely even through contested airspace.\n\nThe aircrews have specifically focused on practicing how they find, fix, track and target enemy forces, facilities or other threats, honing their speed and accuracy, the Air Force said. The bomber crews train against both ground and air-based threats that seek to prevent them from operating over enemy-controlled territory.\n\n\u201cThis deployment allows us to train the way we fight \u2014 integrated with NATO allies, ready and adaptive,\u201d Lt. Col. Eric Alvarez, deployed commander of the 345th, said in an Aug. 9 statement. \u201cIt\u2019s about building experience and trust together, enhancing readiness and staying sharp in dynamic environments.\u201d\n\nThe 345th is made up of reserve airmen from the 489th Bomb Group, and active duty airmen from the 7th Bomb Wing, both stationed at Dyess.\n\nThe B-1s\u2019 deployment marks the fifth bomber task force mission to Europe this year \u201cand reflects the U.S. Air Force\u2019s continued commitment to maintaining a ready and capable forward presence across the region,\u201d the service said.\n\nThe Hungarian Gripens that took part in Tuesday\u2019s flyover are also on a deployment of their own, to \u0160iauliai Air Base in Lithuania where they are temporarily handling NATO\u2019s air policing mission. The four Hungarian Gripens in Lithuania are on alert to provide a quick reaction if necessary, alongside eight Spanish Typhoon jets.\n\nLithuania lies to the south of Latvia, and the northwest of Belarus, which is Russia\u2019s closest regional ally in its invasion of Ukraine.",

      "text": "The Air Force finished retiring 17 B-1B Lancer bombers this week, its first step toward divesting the entire fleet within the next two decades.\nThe last of the bombers, which have been in the Air Force since 1985, left Edwards Air Force Base, California, Thursday for the service\u2019s aviation graveyard at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, Air Force Global Strike Command said in a release Friday.\nRELATED\n\u201cThe divestiture plan was executed very smoothly,\u201d Brig. Gen. Kenyon Bell, AFGSC director of logistics and engineering, said in the release. \u201cWith fewer aircraft in the B-1 fleet, maintainers will be able to give more time and attention to each aircraft remaining in the fleet.\u201d\nB-1Bs can wield conventional weapons but not nuclear arms, and can carry the largest load of guided and unguided weapons of any Air Force aircraft. The 62-jet fleet is being phased out to make way for the dual-capable, stealthy B-21 Raider bomber now in production at Northrop Grumman.\nForty-five of the original 100 B-1Bs are still in use and are housed at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, and Dyess AFB, Texas. The Air Force retired about three dozen in the early 2000s and has lost several others in crashes. It received its first Lancer in 1985 and first deployed it in combat against Iraq in 1998.\nBut heavy use in U.S. Central Command for missions like close air support for ground troops \u2014 which the B-1 wasn\u2019t built to do \u2014 came at a cost. Less than half of the Lancer fleet was combat-ready in 2019, for example, when only six bombers were available for regular operations.\n\u201cContinuous operations over the last 20 years have taken a toll on our B-1B fleet, and the aircraft we retired would have taken between $10 [million] and $30 million \u2026 per aircraft to get back to a status quo fleet in the short term until the B-21 comes online,\u201d Global Strike said.\nRELATED\nThose issues have led to multiple stand-downs to address concerns like onboard fires and malfunctioning ejection seats. All Lancers are operational again after a fuel tank issue prompted a fleetwide grounding earlier this year, Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson Lt. Col. Will Russell said. He did not answer how many planes needed repairs during the pause.\nOf those that were retired starting in February, 13 headed to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group\u2019s boneyard in Arizona. Four of the B-1s at Davis-Monthan can be restored to flight if the Air Force needs them.\nOf the remaining four, one will help the service develop new structural maintenance methods at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; one will be used for ground testing at Edwards; one will become part of a digital engineering project at the National Institute for Aviation Research in Kansas; and one will go on display at Global Strike headquarters at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.\nThe Air Force is working toward a two-bomber inventory with the B-21, slated to start arriving in the mid-2020s, and the B-52H Stratofortresses that have been flying for six decades. It has not announced when it will begin to retire another group of B-1Bs or begin drawing down the B-2 Spirit fleet.\nRachel Cohen is the editor of Air Force Times.

      "text": "A bomber task force comprising 150 airmen and three B-2 Spirit aircraft from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, arrived at Iceland\u2019s Keflavik Air Base on Sunday, U.S. Air Forces in Europe announced Monday.\nThe visit marks the stealth bomber\u2019s return to routine operational rotations after a jet caught fire in December, prompting the Air Force to ground the fleet for five months. And the aircraft has been away from Europe even longer: It last deployed to the region for six months in 2021.\nWhile across the Atlantic, B-2s will train with American and allied troops and take on real-world surveillance and long-range strike missions as needed. The aircraft, which can carry conventional and nuclear weapons, also serve to deter Russia from employing nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine \u2014 and, by extension, its NATO neighbors.\n\u201cThis [bomber task force] initiative was designed to bolster [U.S. European Command\u2019s] overarching security mandates across the European continent, while also affording aircrews the opportunity to acclimate themselves to the intricacies of joint and coalition operations in foreign locations,\u201d the Air Force said in a release Monday.\nThough the aircraft were approved to return to normal operations in May, it remains unclear what happened over the course of myriad safety inspections or whether any bombers are still out of commission. The Air Force has not yet released a public version of its investigation into that accident.\nThe Spirits are replacing a task force of B-1 Lancer bombers \u2014 the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron out of Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, that arrived in Europe in May.\nDuring that rotation, the Lancers headed to the Middle East to participate in a live-fire exercise with advanced munitions as a show of force in the region. The U.S. has dispatched additional air and sea assets to U.S. Central Command in response to rising tensions with Russian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria.\nTwo B-1s flew from RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom to release guided bombs and an air-to-surface cruise missile at ranges in Jordan and Saudi Arabia on June 8, according to Al-Monitor.\n\u201cIt was the first time AFCENT flew multiple weapons types and practiced employment against multiple simulated targets during [a] single bomber task force mission,\u201d the Air Force said June 8.\nWhile in Europe, the Lancers also practiced hot-pit refueling, or receiving gas with the engine running, in Romania, and landed in Sweden for the first time, among other training missions.\nThe Air Force began sending its bomber fleets on short-term deployments around the world in 2018 amid fears that longer stints overseas could make them vulnerable to attack. But the trust and experience American airmen gain with their foreign counterparts on those periodic visits remains valuable.\n\u201cThere is simply no substitute for the hands-on integration with our allies and partners that we\u2019re able to accomplish during a BTF deployment like this one,\u201d Lt. Col. Andrew Kousgaard, who is leading the B-2 deployment as commander of the 393rd Bomb Squadron, said in Monday\u2019s release."
