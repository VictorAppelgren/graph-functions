      "summary": "President Donald Trump announced the federalization of Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department and the deployment of approximately 800 National Guard troops to address crime in the capital, which he described as 'totally out of control.' This directive allows local police to share information with federal immigration authorities, a move Trump and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem praised as a step towards enhancing public safety. However, the decision has faced criticism from Democrats, who argue it represents an overreach of federal power and could be challenged in court regarding the legitimacy of the emergency declaration.",
