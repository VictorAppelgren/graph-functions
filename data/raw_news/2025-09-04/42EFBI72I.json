  "content": "SHENZHEN, China, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With the growing demand for drone components, WayKen Rapid Manufacturing has once again upgraded its CNC titanium machining capabilities to provide more reliable and efficient solutions. This upgrade targets complex structural parts in high-mix, low-volume (HMLV) scenarios, highlighting WayKen's deep technical expertise and manufacturing capabilities in the drone industry.\n\nWith drones becoming increasingly essential in industries such as agriculture, construction, surveying, and logistics, the demand for lightweight, high-strength, and precision-engineered components is growing rapidly. However, drone manufacturers face multiple challenges, including material selection, vibration and noise reduction design, high-precision assembly, and the HMLV production approach.\n\nIn terms of materials, manufacturers need to balance between light weight and strength, with aluminum alloys and titanium alloys being the preferred choices. At the same time, micro-vibrations during processing can affect the assembly tolerances and precision of small parts, requiring careful design of processing strategies and equipment configurations. In addition, faced with an order structure characterized by multiple models and small batches, production systems must be capable of rapid changeovers and flexible automation.\n\nThe WayKen machine shop is equipped with high-precision CNC machining services centers, including multiple top-tier machines from leading international brands such as the JDGR400T five-axis machining center and the Haas VF-4SS ultra-high-speed vertical machining center. These advanced machines provide a solid foundation for the efficient and accurate machining of complex structural components.\n\nThe workshop also maintains a temperature-controlled machining environment, keeping both temperature and humidity within optimal ranges. This helps minimize thermal expansion of machine components and prevents workpieces from rusting or oxidizing due to environmental factors. In addition, WayKen uses a professional-grade tool management system that monitors tool wear in real time, ensuring consistent cutting performance and high-quality surfaces on all parts.\n\nAt WayKen, parts can typically be machined to an accuracy within 0.05 mm, and for critical dimensions, tolerances as tight as 0.005 mm to 0.002 mm can be achieved. The workshop also supports a machined surface finish of up to Ra 0.2 \u03bcm, offering versatile solutions for the precision machining of complex structural components.\n\nDrone components often feature lightweight designs, multiple curved surfaces, thin walls, and high-precision requirements, making them challenging to process. WayKen combines 3-, 4-, and 5-axis CNC milling and turning with EDM, wire cutting, and other processes to create a comprehensive precision machining system. Operating under a quality management system that strictly follows ISO 9001 and IATF 16949 standards, they deliver one-stop machining solutions.\n\nDuring the development of a small-batch titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) industrial drone camera housing, WayKen devised a rigorous machining plan to meet the housing\u2019s demands for structural strength, sealing performance, heat dissipation, and modular design.\n\nThe drone housing features complex geometries on nearly every surface, requiring up to five instances of flipping, clamping, and repositioning during processing, combined with T-shaped tools for milling the internal cavities. To achieve the required precision for critical sealing grooves (Ra 0.8) and dimensional tolerances (\u00b10.025 mm), the engineering team optimized the machining paths and clamping methods to ensure accurate positioning of complex geometries. In addition, low-speed cutting with precision tools was employed to maintain the necessary machining accuracy.\n\n\u201cDrone component machining demands not just precision, but also agility and speed,\u201d said a WayKen production manager. \u201cWith this new upgrade, we can respond faster, deliver tighter tolerances, and help our customers bring competitive products to market.\u201d\n\nIn addition to camera housings, WayKen also manufactures structural frame components that require strict dimensional accuracy. For example, a drone output link requires a 28-millimeter hole with an h6 tolerance\u2014an extremely high standard for hole-shaft fits. WayKen achieves this precision using advanced five-axis CNC machine tools, followed by black anodizing to maintain accuracy. Final inspections are carried out with a Zeiss coordinate measuring machine (CMM) to ensure compliance with geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) requirements.\n\nWayKen remains committed to on-demand manufacturing, enabling it to swiftly adapt to evolving customer needs and design specifications. The company provides high-mix, low-volume (HMLV) customized solutions to meet the dynamic demands of the drone industry. Through this capability upgrade, WayKen has demonstrated a significant competitive edge in drone component manufacturing. WayKen will continue to advance research and development in flexible manufacturing and precision machining technologies, driving transformation in the manufacturing industry.\n\nDisclaimer: This content is provided by WayKen Rapid Manufacturing Limited.

Please feel free to give us feedback to ensure that they meet your expectations.\nDesign For Manufacturability\nA Quick Guide to Designing CNC Machined Parts\nOptimize your designs to avoid unnecessary machining features, limit part complexity, help reduce CNC machining costs and time, and create machined parts faster and more efficiently.\nAs large an internal radius as possible\nAny internal cut will generate a fillet that is half the diameter of the tool used. Milling with smaller tools takes a long time and we recommend that the radius should be greater than 1/3 of the depth of machining. The best bet is to relieve internal corners or allow for as large an internal radius as possible on mating part designs and use the same radius on all inside edges so that the same tool can be used throughout the CNC machining processes.\nAvoid overly deep cavities, grooves and holes\nThe depth of the cavity and groove is usually related to the diameter of the tool used to make the internal fillets, and a good rule of thumb is to keep the cavity depth 3 \u2013 4 times the tool diameter or the groove depth less than 4 times the feature width. Whether blind holes or through holes, the recommended maximum depth is 4 times the diameter and the minimum hole diameter is 1 mm, and it is recommended to design standard size holes. With a standard drill, holes can be machined quickly and with high precision; for non-standard holes, using an end mill will increase costs.\nAvoid thin walls\nAs with tall walls, vibration increases when machining thin features. As a guide, the minimum thickness of thin-walled metal parts should be 0.5-0.8 mm, and the minimum thickness of plastic parts should be 1.0- 1.5 mm. If the walls are for supporting action or taller features, the wall thickness should be increased to avoid vibrations during CNC machining processes.\nAvoid small or raised text\nYou may need to mark parts with part numbers or company names. Adding text looks really cool in the custom CNC machining, but is time-consuming to process; electrochemical etching or laser marking is usually better. If you must cut text, choose recessed rather than raised text whenever possible, keep it simple and large, with a font depth of no more than 0.3mm.\nStick to the standards for threads\nSticking to standard sizes is also important when creating threads. Length should be kept to a maximum of 3 times the nominal diameter of a hole. For blind hole tapping, it is preferable to add an additional length of at least 1/2 hole diameter at the root of the hole. You might also think about using inserts. threaded coils and brass nuts provide longer service life than bare threads, especially in soft materials such as aluminum or plastic, and are easy to install.\nCNC Machining Case Ctudy\nKindly take a closer look at some of the CNC machining projects. At WayKen, we strive to deliver exceptional results and assist you in achieving your machining requirements.\nCNC Machining Technical Solutions\nExplore how WayKen considers your design during the CNC machining process and provides expert manufacturing advice and machining solutions.\nWhat do you need to know about?\nCNC Machining FAQs\nWe offer product developers parts machined from engineering-grade materials that are suitable for functional testing or end-use applications.

Typically, for similar parts, CNC lathes cost 15% less to machine than standard 3-axis CNC milling. In contrast, the cost of 5-axis machining increases, continuous 5-axis CNC milling typically costs over 20% more than an indexed 5-axis machine (also referred to as 3+2 milling), and about double that of a standard 3-axis mill. To achieve the most cost-effective CNC machined parts, larger production runs are recommended to spread the cost of machine setup.\nWhat are the maximum size ranges of your machine travel?\nMaximum Dimensions (3-axis milling): 1270\u00d7508\u00d7635 (mm).\nMaximum Dimensions (5-axis milling): 450\u00d7700\u00d7400 (mm), Worktable Diameter \u03a6400 mm.\nWhat kind of surface finish does CNC machining leave?\nOnce the machining process is complete, the CNC parts surface will have slight visible tool marks, called \u201cas-machined\u201d or \u201cas-milled\u201d surface finish. Machined surface roughness (Ra) is standardized at 1.6-3.2 \u03bcm, and surface finish requirements can be increased to 0.8-1.6 \u03bcm or higher at 0.2-0.8 \u03bcm, however, this will require more operating time and higher costs.\nQuick Overview: CNC Machining Quotes\nWhat information do you need to quote my part?\nIn order to provide a meaningful quote, we require the following information:\nWe accept CAD data in any format, 2D and 3D, including STP, IGES, X_T, DWG, PDF, STL;\nThe expected quantities, machining processes, and raw materials required;\nAny necessary secondary operations, including finishing specifications, heat treatment, anodizing or plating, etc.\nAny applicable customer specifications, such as First Article Inspection, PPAP requirements, and required outside process certificates;\nAny other useful information, such as target pricing or required lead times.\nI don\u2019t have CAD data, can you help me design the part?\nDesigning parts are outside of our scope as a contract manufacturer, but we can provide some guidance on design for manufacturability (DFM). With DFM, we can advise on how to optimize your design and reduce costs while retaining functionality.\nHow quickly can I receive a quote from you for my project?\nIn most cases, we will respond to your quote within 1 business day. The best way to help ensure a quick quote is to provide as much accurate and specific information as possible.\nWhat is your lead time?\nIn fact, there is no standard delivery time and we will schedule production based on the current workload. Once your purchase order is received, documentation is completed, and materials are available, we will provide prompt feedback on the exact delivery time, which can usually be anywhere from 3 business days to a few weeks, depending on the complexity of the part and quantities of parts ordered.\nHow do you ensure the quality of my parts?\nIf you\u2019re worried about Quality Assurance for international orders, an ISO-9001-certified factory won\u2019t let you down. With dedicated inspection equipment and skilled QC/QA staff, we can provide 2D reports / CMM reports / 3D scan reports to ensure the quality of your parts is within the expected range.\n100% of all dimensional tolerances, geometric tolerances, and print notes will be documented according to our MIL-STD-105E based statistical sampling plan with zero rejects. All dimensional inspection reports will be shipped with your parts.\nMore CNC Machining Resources\nWhat is CNC Machining: Processes, Operations & Benefits\nHow much do you know about CNC machining?
