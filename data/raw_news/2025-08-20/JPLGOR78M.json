  "title": "Thank You, Jimmy Fallon, for Making the Google Pixel 10 Event Fun",
  "description": "Commentary: Move over, Pixel 10 -- this is Jimmy Fallon's show now.",
  "content": "You might not know that Google has its own line of Pixel smartphones, but you probably do know Jimmy Fallon. I'm so pleased to report to you all today that Jimmy Fallon, host of The Tonight Show, absolutely stole the show while hosting today's Made by Google keynote.\n\nIn the first 10 minutes of the keynote, Fallon brought back excitement, poked fun at the absurdities of a tech event and ushered in an authenticity that is, frankly, usually lacking from the tech CEOs who usually kick off these kind of events. As a Swiftie, he had me almost immediately when he called today's Pixel hardware drop a \"Taylor Swift album announcement for nerds.\" (He's right, by the way.)\n\nAt today's Made by Google event, the company dropped a whole lot of new hardware, including the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel 10 Pro XL, Pixel 2A earbuds and Pixel watch 4.\n\nFallon wasn't the only celebrity to make a surprise appearance. The show kicked off with a star-studded \"I'm passing the phone to\" video that began with Alex Cooper and included Lando Norris, the Jonas Brothers and Steph Curry. Curry apparently uses Gemini AI for basketball, as does Norris, and the Jonas Brothers filmed a music video using the Pixel 10's new cameras and AI tools.\n\nBut none of these guests compared to Fallon, who acted as possibly the first ever hype man for Pixel hardware, shouting the names of features as Adrienne Lofton, Google's Global Vice President of Product Marketing, introduced the new hardware. We also got a taste of Fallon's late night show in an intimate living room set with two chairs and a podcast mic, where he kicked off the event interviewing Google's Senior Vice President of Platforms and Devices Rick Osterloh about the future of Pixel phones.\n\nGoogle's decision to include these people is one of the smartest keynote redesigns I've seen. Having Fallon host the keynote meant we got so much less jargon. While tech enthusiasts and experts are fluent in AI buzzwords and concepts like walled gardens, Fallon gave Google the opportunity to explain why these updates matter for real-life Pixel users -- something that can sometimes get lost as product reps run through all the new upgrades in traditional keynotes.\n\nBut it's more than just good-natured fun. All of the new hardware and software drops during the last few years have focused on AI. While tech companies, including Google, push us to integrate AI in our daily lives and delegate our mundane tasks and some critical thinking, it was refreshing to bring back a little humanity to this next generation of tech.\n\nJimmy Fallon, if you or one of your employees ever end up reading this, allow me to speak on behalf of all of us tech nerds and say: Thank you.\n\nAnd Apple, you have one month to nail down Stephen Colbert for your iPhone 17 event.",

      "text": "Samsung recently unveiled its \"fan-edition\" Galaxy Buds 3 FE earbuds ($150), a more affordable version of its flagship Galaxy Buds Pro 3 earbuds that leave off a few features. You can think about Google's Pixel Buds 2A ($130) in much the same way.\nEssentially a slightly stripped-down version of Google's highly rated flagship Pixel Buds Pro 2 ($229), they look very similar but don't offer quite the same performance or feature set for a more affordable price. Introduced at Google's Pixel 10 launch event, they're available now for preorder in hazel or iris and ship Oct. 9.\nRead more: Best Wireless Earbuds of 2025\nGoogle says the Pixel Buds 2A's design was \"inspired\" by the Pixel Buds Pro 2's design and, at first glance, it's not so easy to figure out what's different about them. While the Pixel Buds 2A are also powered by Google Tensor A1 chip, they're missing a microphone in each bud (they have two mics per bud while the Buds Pro 2 have three) and the Buds 2A leave off wireless charging, a voice accelerometer, head tracking for spatial audio and a ringtone speaker in the case for Find My Device.\nWhile the Buds 2A weigh exactly the same as the Buds Pro 2 (4.7 grams) and also have 11mm drivers, their battery life is rated for an hour less -- 7 hours instead of 8 with noise canceling on. They also feature Silent Seal 1.5 for noise canceling instead of Silent Seal 2.0, which presumably means their noise canceling isn't quite as good. Here's a full list of the differences between the two earbuds that I found.\nHow the Google Pixel Buds 2A are different from Pixel Buds Pro 2\n- Two microphones per bud instead of three\n- No wireless charging or ringtone speaker in the case for Find My Device\n- No voice accelerometer to help detect when you're talking\n- No Conversation Detection feature that automatically lowers volume when you speak and activates transparency mode so you can have a conversation\n- No motion-detecting accelerometer and gyroscope (no head tracking for spatial audio)\n- Silent Seal 1.5 for noise canceling instead of Silent Seal 2.0\n- Up to 7 hours of battery life instead of 8 (noise canceling on)\n- Charging case weighs 47.6 grams (with earbuds inside) instead of 65 grams\n- Made out of 41% recycled materials instead of 24%\nThe two models fit similarly, with the same stability wing on each bud and a twist-to-fit design. The buds are lightweight and compact and should fit most ears well but I had some trouble getting a tight seal with the Buds Pro 2's included ear tips (I ended up using my own tips) and I suspect I may have the same seal issue with these buds.\nAt the same time it revealed the Pixel Buds 2A, Google noted that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will be getting some new features in October via a firmware update. These include an adaptive audio mode that \"intelligently adapts to your surroundings\" (similar to Apple's adaptive audio mode for the AirPods Pro 2 that softens loud noises as you encounter them to protect your hearing) and new Gemini features that will allow to speak to Gemini live in noisy environments. Gemini is Google's AI voice assistant.\nI'll let you know how the Pixel Buds 2A stack up performance-wise to the Buds Pro 2 and other earbuds in this price class, including the new Samsung Galaxy Buds FE, as soon as I get my hands on a review sample in early October. For now, here's a look at the Pixel Buds 2A's key specs, according to Google.\nGoogle Pixel Buds 2A key specs\n- IP54 dust-resistant and splash proof (case is IPX4 splash proof)\n- Weight: 4.7 grams per bud\n- Bluetooth 5.4\n- Google Tensor A1\n- Custom-designed 11mm dynamic speaker driver\n- Active noise cancellation with Silent Seal 1.5\n- Transparency mode\n- Active in-ear pressure relief\n- Bluetooth Super Wideband\n- Battery life: 7 hours with noise-canceling on with an additional 20 hours in the case\n- Clear Calling\n- Wind-blocking mesh covers\n- Two microphones per bud\n- Capacitive touch (tap) sensors for music, calls and voice-assistant controls\n- IR proximity sensor for in-ear detection to play and pause automatically\n- Hall Effect sensor for case open and close detection\n- USB-C charging\n- Colors: iris and hazel\n- Price: $130\n- Ship date: Oct. 9"

      "text": "Made by Google 2025 Live: Pixel 10, Pixel Watch 4, Gemini News and Android 16\nGoogle's newest Pixel phones are about to be revealed -- what's in store?\nGoogle has revealed its next phone lineup, the Pixel 10 series. After the usual raft of leaks and even teasers by the tech giant itself, it's finally unveiled its new lineup of devices.\nThe Made by Google event kicked off at 10 a.m. PT (12 p.m. ET, 5 p.m. BST) Wednesday, though news came in fast ahead of it. A series of new Pixel 10 phones, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold foldable, the Pixel Buds 2A and the Pixel Watch 4 have all been revealed. Here are all the details as they were revealed during the event -- which was a surprisingly fun affair with host Jimmy Fallon leading viewers on a celebrity-filled tour of all the new perks coming to Google's devices.\nHere are our first looks at Google's lineup:\nAnd that's a wrap on Made by Google\nWith a screening of the Jonas Brothers' shot-on-a-Pixel-10 music video, the Made By Google event comes to a somewhat abrupt close for us online viewers -- no send-off goodbye from Fallon, just the memories of one of the stranger product launches we've had in years. But perhaps it cracks open the door for more human chats in an era of slick presentations and more AI.\nThat's not the end of our coverage, though -- head to CNET.com for all our reviews of Google's new lineup of phones, foldables, smartwatches and earbuds. And you can keep watching the video above for Bridget and Iyaz's takes on everything that was announced.\nNick Jonas joins Jimmy Fallon\nNick Jonas joined the end of the Pixel 10 event to debut his band's music video, which was purportedly filmed on the Pixel 10.\nInside the venue, the audio for this song is so overblown, but this is the latest in a line of music videos filmed on phones. Prior Pixel phones (and the iPhone) have had similar demos.\nSubwayTakes roasts wired headphones\nKareem Rahma from the internet talk show SubwayTakes hopped out of the crowd at Made by Google to roll a tape. The TikTok-style video takes digs at the resurgence of wired headphones.\nPeloton's Cody Rigsby joins for the Fitbit sketch, er, segment\nThe Pixel Watch 4 and its Fitbit features take the spotlight for this bit, featuring Peloton coach Cody Rigsby and Google Product Manager Noah Presler. While the earlier segments have a more informercial vibe, this one feels more like a comedy sketch. Peloton content does appear in the Fitbit app, which would explain why he's a guest.\nThe Pixel 10 translation live demo went over swimmingly\nDuring a surprise demo of the Pixel 10's live call translation feature, Fallon sat down for a chat on the phone with YouTube star Karen Polinesia -- who spoke only Spanish for the demonstration.\nFallon's English was translated to Spanish for Polinesia to engage with, in a voice that sounded kind of like his own with the addition of a robotic accent. Polinesia responded in turn, and her own voice was translated into English with very little downtime between the speech and the live translation.\nThis was a tight demo, and it seemed successful overall. The Pixel 10 phone call translations shown off at Made by Google follow on the heels of the Google Meet translations, which were shown off at Google I/O earlier this year.\nThe Jonas Brothers showed off Pixel Phones being used to shoot music videos\nMusical sensation The Jonas Brothers showed how they tried to make a music video in a day with a few hundred dollars and a Pixel smartphone. The brothers shot a video for their song I Can't Lose entirely on the Pixel 10 Pro, in New York City. Their behind-the-scenes look was amusing, with entertaining bits like a leaf blower being used to simulate wind in the hair.\nThe resulting show actually looked pretty good. There was a shot with one of the brothers looking forlorn at a table in a restaurant with \"rain\" on the window -- which was water being poured out of a watering can. The demo highlighted the handset's ability to shoot in 8K and take wide-angle shots, zoom in from afar, take video at night in low-light conditions and more.\nFrom Camera Coach to shots by real photographers using the Pixel 10\nAfter the Alex Cooper chat and using Camera Coach, now we turn to a true photographer -- Brooklyn's own Andre D. Wagner, whose much-lauded photos of Black Americans have been featured in galleries and the Smithsonian. Wagner shared photos he took around New York City using a Pixel 10 phone; Google has spent years working on its True Tone to more accurately capture darker skin tones.\nCNET Editor at Large Andrew Lanxon took the Pixel 10 Pro XL on a photo safari on the streets of Paris -- check out his photos here.\nGoogle's Pixel phones can use Camera Coach to improve photos\nPodcaster Alex Cooper helped demonstrate various features of Google's Pixel phones, specifically Camera Coach. The concept is to use Camera Coach to get a great first photograph or edit photos without being a professional -- or even amateur -- photographer. Cooper showcased Camera Coach providing real-time suggestions for lighting, framing and even poses for the subjects.\nThe Made by Google set\nWhile the show changes segments, here's a wide view of the entire Made by Google set.\nGoogle doesn't want it to be scary to transition to Pixel phones\nOne of the points hammered home by Fallon's pseudo-infomercial with Lofton is that Google wants to make it easy for people to transition from other phones to the Pixel 10.\nIf you're wondering why Google would want to quell fears about that transition, it's because Pixel phones are already making up a lot of ground in terms of US market share: According to 9to5Google, the Google Pixel phone lineup has settled into a top 4 spot in the market, and makes up 3% of all US phone sales.\nGoogle seems to be pushing a general sentiment of unifying phone ecosystems -- one of the examples is the imminent death of \"blue and green\" text bubbles for messages sent between iPhone and Android phones, as Mike posted below. If the experiential divide lessens between these phones, swapping over might not be something to fear.\nGoogle's done with green and blue bubbles\nAfter almost a year of Apple's iOS supporting the RCS texting standard, Lofton declared the company is \"done\" with the green and blue bubble conversation, referring to Apple's iMessage.\nSince both iPhones and Android phones support the RCS texting standard, most texting features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing are now available, as long as RCS is turned on in the respective phone's settings. Lofton provided a brief summarization of the texting standard, mainly to argue that while the Pixel itself doesn't support Apple's iMessage, Google is otherwise done with arguing that the messaging parity isn't there.\nWe'll see if that is indeed the case in the future, as Apple and Google will likely continue to develop exclusive texting features to continue to compete with each other. And RCS doesn't yet support encryption when texting between the iPhone and Android, but that feature has been in development and is expected to eventually arrive.\nFallon demonstrates Magic Cue feature\nFallon demo'd Magic Cue, a new AI feature that will contextually surface information from other apps. Fallon's phone found the name of a restaurant from a booking email to send to Google's Osterloh and a specific photo of a dog to send to podcaster Alex Cooper.\nPixelSnap is Google's way of saying MagSafe\nGoogle's PixelSnap is following Apple's MagSafe in providing a branded way of describing magnetic attachments that work with the Pixel 10 line. But even though Google is using this marketing term, most MagSafe accessories should work with the Pixel 10 as both are based on the Qi2 magnetic wireless charging standard.\nIn short, that means even if Google makes it sound like it's special to the Pixel, it's actually much more open then that. The Pixel 10 line should work with Qi2 accessories, MagSafe accessories and these new \"PixelSnap\" accessories just fine.\nPixel 10 lineup keeps getting hyped with every other word\nEach of the Pixel devices are being run through by Fallon and Lofton. As it's a talk show, the audience is being prompted to cheer loudly every time a new device comes out.\nWhile it's starting to hurt my ears, it is on-brand. It's much like when people in Rachael Ray's talk show audience would cheer for her mashed potatoes.\nPixel 10 meets QVC -- we've gone full infomercial\nAfter a brief video with F1's Lando Norris, Fallon shifts over to a table full of Google's new devices as the company's VP of Global Marketing, Adrienne Lofton, walks him through everything announced today. The infomercial vibes are off the charts.\nFallon is bringing the energy for each and every product Lofton presents, which is another shift away from the slick commercial spots we get at Apple and Samsung shows.\nYou can get a year of Google AI Pro with purchase of a Pixel 10 Pro or Pro Fold\nGoogle revealed at its Made by Google event that if you buy a Pixel 10 Pro or Pro Fold, you'll get a year of the company's Google AI Pro artificial intelligence suite. AI Pro includes the Gemini AI assistant, Flow (a filmmaking tool), Whisk (for image-to-video creation), 1,000 monthly AI credits to use in Flow and Whisk, NotebookLM (research and writing assistant), Jules (coding agent for developers), 2TB of storage for Drive/Photos/Gmail and Gemini in Google suite (Docs, Sheets, Gmail, etc.).\nOsterloh showed how he used his Pixel phone as a sort of creative studio by leveraging the Veo text-to-video AI model to animate a video of his adorable dog, Dakota, talking into microphones like a podcast host.\nTalk show BTS\nMuch like a talk show, the crew is setting up on a second stage while a pretaped segment airs.\nAnd while conversations may appear off the cuff in this talk show format, there is definitely a teleprompter too like other TV shows.\nIs the future of tech events... talk shows?\nWatching Jimmy Fallon do a sit-down interview with Google's Rick Osterloh feels more relaxed and human than the slick, high-production events we've seen from Apple and Samsung. Perhaps the dude chatter is going on a little long when viewers are waiting for big, flashy product announcements, but at least we're spared the breathless train of commercial spots we're used to from these events. It's a little low-tech charming to see Jimmy Fallon read out printed social media posts.\nShots fired at Apple's iPhone during Fallon's Reddit read out\nWhile sitting down with Google's senior vice president of devices and services, Jimmy Fallon pulled out a compilation of the \"greatest hits\" from the Google Pixel subreddit. In the posts he showed off, different users lauded the Circle to Search feature and credited Pixel's crash detection feature with potentially saving their life.\nThings got spicy when Fallon showed off a post written by a user who said his Pixel phone photos put his friends' iPhones to shame. Shots fired -- and Osterloh shared a bashful grin with the audience during the segment.\nGoogle's Rick Osterloh is first guest\nJimmy Fallon is speaking with Rick Osterloh to kick off the event, with some reminiscing of the first Pixel launch.\nJimmy Fallon gives a Google monologue\nIn a very Tonight Show-like fashion, Fallon began with a monologue before bringing out Google's Rick Osterloh.\nTalk show host Jimmy Fallon kicks off Made by Google\nJimmy Fallon got the Made by Google event going, saying \"we're going to party as hard as we possibly can on a Wednesday at 1 p.m.\"\nPixel 10 phones get satellite-powered apps\nThe Pixel 10 lineup gets another perk: satellite-enhanced apps, thanks to T-Mobile. The phones will use the carrier's T-Satellite service to expand connectivity for three apps to start -- Google Maps, Google Messages and Find Hub -- to get functionality in areas where conventional mobile data can't reach.\nT-Mobile officially launched T-Satellite in June, which runs on SpaceX's Starlink network of microsatellites. After promising tests connecting subscribers beyond terrestrial cell networks, the carrier announced that it would be expanding this capability to apps starting Oct. 1 -- though it seems Google got an exception to launch early. Read the whole story by CNET Senior Writer Jeff Carlson.\nCNET's lead photographer captured gorgeous pictures with the Pixel 10 Pro XL\nCNET's Andrew Lanxon got hands-on time with the Pixel 10 Pro XL while taking an exclusive photo walk in Paris, during which he snapped hundreds of pictures of people, places and cats.\nWhat were his conclusions about the Pixel 10 Pro XL's cameras? Not much about the hardware has changed, but the new phone takes beautiful pictures nonetheless.\nHe wasn't big on the Camera Coach feature, but the new AI tool probably isn't designed to make any earth-shattering revelations to folks that have been in the professional photography game for over a decade. Check out Lanxon's favorite Pixel 10 Pro photos here.\nGoogle merch\nEvent swag is being handed out in the crowd of the event, such as this charming Google mug.\nWarmup guy as we wait for the event to start\nThe Made by Google event is being hosted by talk show host Jimmy Fallon. Like a broadcast show, we have a warmup guy cracking jokes to get the crowd to cheer more once the event starts.\nThe Pixel Watch 4's upgrades help it go toe-to-toe with Apple Watches\nThe Google Pixel Watch 4 had been announced, and its improvements posit it as one of -- if not the --- best Android Watch on the market. You'll find an artificial intelligence-powered health coach, satellite SOS connectivity, better battery life and simpler repairs. Starting at $349, the Pixel Watch 4 packs a lot of value. In Vanessa Hand Orellana's hands-on look, the Pixel Watch 4 felt like a solid upgrade from the Pixel Watch 3.\nWhile the Pixel Watch 4 might look similar to its predecessor, there's more screen real estate thanks to smaller bezels -- in all, you get 10% more usable screen area than before, which is 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3 to make it easier to see in broad daylight. The new watch packs an enhanced battery that Google claims will be 25% better than the Pixel Watch 3, theoretically putting it at 30 hours for the 41mm model, and 40 hours for the 45mm version -- or up to three days in low-power mode.\nIn a refreshing move, the battery and display are replaceable, so select providers can repair Google's latest smartwatch. Swappable parts are nice to see -- hopefully your watch will be OK, but if you need a fix, it might not be as much of a hassle or as expensive.\n$130 Pixel Buds 2A revealed\nGoogle has introduced the Pixel Buds 2A, which cost $130, are up for preorder now and ship Oct. 9. The earbuds come in the colors hazel or iris and look similar to the $229 Pixel Buds Pro 2. While they are a more affordable option, they don't provide the same performance or feature set.\nWe can expect to hear about the earbuds at today's Made by Google event, which starts at 1 p.m. ET. To see all the ways the Pixel Buds 2A differ from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, check out David Carnoy's comparison.\nThe Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are evolutions, not overhauls\nThe Made by Google event is our first look at the new Pixel 10 phone, which builds on the design of its predecessor by adding new tools like a Gemini AI-powered Camera Coach and refining existing features such as a higher maximum screen brightness. For the first time, instead of being a scaled-down version of the Pixel Pro series, the Pixel 10 is more of a hybrid model that has a similar design and model as the Pixel 10 Pro but with the same main and ultrawide cameras that you'd find in the Pixel 9A.\nSpeaking of the Pixel 10 Pro, we got a chance to see that upcoming phone, too. The new phone, which CNET's Andrew Lanxon described as an \"evolution of its predecessor\" rather than an overhaul, includes the Tensor G5 processor and an increasing amount of AI tools -- especially for photography. The Pixel 10 Pro also integrates Qi2 wireless charging technology, which should help it charge faster when you don't have a wired charger on hand.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold may be the most durable foldable\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is here, and it achieves a surprising feat: a foldable that's been certified with an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, which is the level of durability seen in most conventional flat smartphones released today. That means you won't have to worry about small dust particles and sand, making the Pixel 10 Pro Fold the first beach-ready foldable, as CNET Senior Technology Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti noted in her review.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold packs plenty of other upgrades, like a Tensor G5 chip, a larger 5,015-mAh battery than last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold (5,650 mAh), Qi2 wireless charging with magnetic functionality to snap on chargers and more. Check out CNET's full Pixel 10 Pro Fold review here.\nThe breakfast spread at Made by Google\nNow that we're inside the Made by Google event, we're filling up on snacks and coffee ahead of the show. Reporters need carbs and caffeine, too! OK, maybe not this many carbs.\nBadges in hand for Made by Google\nWe've arrived at Made by Google\nWe're here at the Made by Google event in Brooklyn about an hour before the event starts, and I -- along with CNET Associate Social Producer Tara Brown -- will be adding our live updates from the event. See you inside!\nYou can probably expect Pixel 9 pricing for the new phones -- at least for now\nIt's rumored that the Pixel 10 phone line will retail at the same prices as their Pixel 9 predecessors. That means you might expect to get your hands on the base 128GB storage Pixel 10 for $799, and the 256GB model for $899. Following this trend, the base storage Pixel 10 Pro would retail for $999 and the base 256GB Pixel 10 Pro XL would retail for $1,199.\nSupposedly, the Pixel 10 phone line won't be affected by tariff pricing at launch, though this could change at a later date. CNET will continue coverage of pricing fluctuations for all of the newest technology.\nGoogle's own teaser showed the standard Pixel 10's big upgrade\nLast month, Google itself dropped an official tease of the Pixel 10 -- a short animation showing the back of the phone, which looks roughly like last year's Pixel 9 phones with a bit more metal framing around the camera bump. But the big addition is what's inside the camera bump: a third camera.\nThe Pixel 9 had a 50-megapixel main camera and 48-megapixel ultrawide shooter, so presumably the third camera would be a telephoto for distance photography, much like with the Pro versions of Google's phones. Apple retains twin cameras on its standard iPhone 16 to differentiate its regular and Pro models, so Google could get an edge by adding that zoom camera to its base Pixel 10 -- and would put in on par with the Samsung Galaxy S25, which also has three rear cameras.\nWhere is the Pixel 10 Flip?\nGoogle launched its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, in 2023. Last year, it followed-up with a top-to-bottom upgrade of the phone called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Looking at rumors and teases by Google, it's safe to say that the company will be launching a Pixel 10 Pro Fold during its Made by Google event on Wednesday. But where is the Pixel 10 Flip?\nGoogle is one of the only phone-makers with a single foldable model. Samsung has its Galaxy Z Fold line and its Galaxy Z Flip series. When is Google going to launch a flip phone? Or is the company going the Motorola route and sticking to just one kind of foldable? While I don't think Google will launch a Pixel Flip, it will be curious how much the company leans into foldables for its Pixel line.\nI'm here for the Pixel 10's rumored summer splash of color\nThe Made by Google event is about to reveal the Pixel 10, and if the rumors are true, the new phone will be uncharacteristically colorful. The lineup for the base phone will supposedly include obsidian, indigo, frost and lemonade colors. That zesty yellow phone is the refreshing change of pace that I want to see, and it'll totally add summery vibes to anyone's pocket.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro has a similarly fun set of rumored colors, though none of them sound quite as eye-catching as the mellow yellow Pixel 10. Android Headlines reported on rumored renders that display obsidian, porcelain, moonstone and jade (aka black, white, gray and green) models for the Pro. Jade is a cool tone that might turn a few heads, but it's no lemonade.\nNoted leaker Evan Blass posted additional Pixel 10 photos, lending more credence to the rumors about these Pixel 10 colors. Let's cross our fingers that the light yellow adds some flair to the phone without looking too gaudy.\nWill the Pixel 10 lineup support the Qi2 wireless standard?\nA rumored change to the Pixel 10 lineup could make the phones more attractive -- literally and figuratively. The Pixel 10 series could come with built-in magnets as part of a shift to fully supporting Qi2 wireless charging. If the rumors are true, you could use magnetic accessories (potentially including Apple's MagSafe chargers) interchangeably with the iPhone and the Pixel.\nThe shift could be significant for the Qi2 wireless standard, as the HMD Skyline is the other Android phone currently supporting Qi2. (There are examples of Qi2 charging with phone cases, but magnets built into Android devices aren't common.) In addition to magnetic compatibility, the Qi2 version also brings a faster wireless charging speed than the earlier version, Qi.\nRight now, whether the Pixel 10 lineup will support the Qi2 wireless standard is unclear. An image posted by leaker Evan Blass seems to show a phone with a circular charger attached via magnets. According to a report from Android Authority, the near future could see us shopping for magnetic \"Pixelsnap\" accessories from Google.\nJimmy Fallon hosting Made by Google 2025 and already he's dropping spoilers\nLate-night host Jimmy Fallon is taking on a daytime side gig as the emcee of the Made by Google event tomorrow. In a TikTok video released by the Google Pixel account, Fallon appears excited to introduce new features such as [bleep], [bleep] and of course [bleep] \"which I'm not allowed to talk about.\" It's a light-hearted jab, given that so many rumored details of the Pixel 10 and other products have leaked ahead of the event.\n@googlepixel @Jimmy Fallon is officially hosting #MadeByGoogle and he wants to tell you all about it (a little too much if you ask us). #GooglePixel \u266c original sound - Google Pixel\nWe may see Google's Tensor G5 chip in the Pixel 10 Android phone lineup\nGoogle's Pixel 10 handsets may use the Tensor G5 chip. The Tensor G4 was at the core of last year's Pixel 9 series, so it logically follows that the company will feature the Tensor G5 as its predecessor -- unless there's a name change. Rumors by Android Authority suggest the new chip might be made by chip fabricator TSMC. Moreover, the G5 system on a chip reportedly uses a 3nm process node, meaning that it could be both more powerful and more efficient than the G4, which uses 4nm, but real-world differences in battery life and CPU or GPU performance may be marginal at best.\nIn our Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review, we found its benchmarked performance unimpressive. The G4 was only marginally better than the Pixel 8 Pro's G3 processor and fell short of competitors like the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, although performance was solid in everyday usage. Whether playing a demanding game of Genshin Impact or generating AI images, the Pixel Pro 9 XL never felt slow, even if it could have packed more oomph. We're hoping -- and expecting -- that even if the G5 doesn't win any benchmarking competitions, that it's similarly snappy in daily use.\nHow to watch the Made by Google Pixel 10 Event\nOn Aug. 20, Google is slated to unveil its latest Pixel devices, including phones, earbuds, wearables and more, at its Made by Google event. The event kicks off at 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Aug. 20. You can stream the Made by Google event on YouTube.\nI hope the Pixel 10 has better AI, instead of just more AI\nThe Made by Google event is tomorrow and we will officially see the Pixel 10 line unveiled. Last year's Pixel 9 series showed Google integrating Gemini into its line of phones. One of the most impactful moments I had with the Pixel 9 Pro was using Gemini Live. Nearly everything about it wowed me from being able to talk to it like a person, to the interface. I did get some less than reliable answers (also very much like a person) but could see the possibilities.\nFor the Pixel 10 series, I'd like Google to really elevate the quality of the AI integrated on the Pixel. Focus on quality over quantity and aim at using AI to solve common problems instead of more niche ones."

      "text": "Google's new Pixel Watch 4 may have dethroned its predecessor (at least on paper) as our favorite Android Watch, setting a new standard for the rest of the smartwatch world.\nThe company debuted its latest smartwatch at its Made by Google event alongside its new phone lineup and budget-friendly earbuds. With an AI-powered health coach, improved battery life, first-of-its-kind satellite connectivity and easier repairs, the $350 Pixel Watch 4 feels like it was pulled straight from my personal wishlist. If it can deliver on all those promises, it may even give the next Apple Watch a serious run for its money.\nCompared to decade-long veterans like Samsung's Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch, the Pixel Watch still feels like the new kid on the block. But from the start, it's nailed that sweet spot between stylish hardware, robust (Fitbit-powered) health features, and seamless integration with Google's ecosystem. Rather than coasting on what already works, Google keeps addressing pain points to make each Pixel Watch better than the last. Now the Pixel Watch 4 marks what the company calls the biggest overhaul since the product first launched.\nPixel Watch 4 pricing and availability\nThe Pixel Watch 4 is available for preorder starting Aug. 20 and in stores Oct. 9. Pricing starts at $349 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model and $399 for the larger 45mm. LTE versions add $100 across the board, at $449 and $499, respectively. Every LTE model also comes with two years of Google Fi data when purchased through the Google Store or Best Buy. The watch also will ship with 32GB of storage Google's latest Wear OS 6 and, as always, will be first in line for future updates.\nPixel Watch 4 screen upgrades\nAt first glance, the Pixel Watch 4 looks a lot like its predecessors. It has the same frameless circular domed screen that seems to bubble up from the center and a metal rotating crown that adds a touch of polish. You still get 41mm and 45mm sizing options but the screen itself is larger thanks to smaller bezels that are 16% thinner and add 10% more usable area.\nThe screen also looks better at a glance. Its more pronounced dome creates a wider viewing angle and brightness has jumped by 50%, hitting a 3,000-nit peak that makes it one of the brightest smartwatch screens. In theory, that means less squinting at your workout metrics when the sun's beating down your back.\nThe screen upgrades look especially nice combined with Material 3 Expressive, Google's latest UI update tailored specifically for the wrist. The display doesn't just look better, it behaves more fluidly. UI elements like buttons and tiles now hug the curve of the screen and colors adapt to match the watch face you chose.\nPixel Watch 4 AI coach\nThe feature I'm most excited to try -- and the one that could truly elevate this watch above the rest \u2013 is a new AI health coach built on Gemini (Google's AI voice assistant). Unlike Samsung's Running Coach or Apple's Workout Buddy, this isn't limited to workout data. It's designed to connect the dots across all your health metrics, offering a more holistic view of how activity, sleep and recovery work together.\nThe feature will roll out in October as a preview through Fitbit Premium in the redesigned Fitbit app and will also be coming to the latest Fitbit trackers and smartwatches. Fitbit says the experience will grow over time as they gather feedback, but at launch, you'll be able to interact with it directly and ask specific health questions like \"How do I improve my VO\u2082 max?\" or \"Should I get an extra hour of sleep or workout tomorrow morning?\" This could add a new layer of contextual guidance on top of the Pixel Watch's already helpful health tools, like its personalized running programs and a body-response sensor that flags potential signs of stress.\nExecution will be key, but if Google delivers, this could be the closest we've come to the true health concierge that I've been dreaming of on a smartwatch.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 will also be better at detecting workouts with new AI-powered activity recognition, which can retroactively flag a session in the app and ask you to confirm if you forgot to hit start. Cyclists can now stream ride stats to their phone as a heads-up display, and the upgraded temperature sensor tracks more detailed variations in skin temperature.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 brings Gemini to the wrist\nOutside of health, Gemini is fully integrated into the Pixel Watch 4 from day one, and it's a massive step up over any other voice assistant we've tried. A new gesture means you won't even have to say \"Hey Google\", just raise your wrist and start talking. An upgraded speaker and stronger haptic engine also makes Gemini's responses easier to hear and alerts harder to miss, so it feels more natural to use without pulling out your phone. Because Gemini processes everything in the cloud, you'll still need either your phone nearby or an LTE connection for it to work.\nPixel Watch 4 battery improvements\nBattery life has always been a weak spot for the Pixel watch, so there was a lot of room for improvement. The Pixel Watch 3 barely hit its 24-hour claim with the always-on display enabled, often falling short for overnight tracking. The Pixel Watch 4 addresses this with a dual-chip setup (Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 plus a Cortex-M55 co-processor) that Google says boosts battery life by 25%. That means up to 30 hours on the 41mm model, 40 hours on the 45mm, or as much as three days in low-power mode.\nJust as important: it now charges faster. You can get to 50% in just 15 minutes, or wait an hour for a full charge. That quick top-up could make a huge difference for 24/7 health tracking especially if you only have a few minutes to charge before starting the day or heading to bed. The secret behind the faster charging is a new side-mounted charging dock (included in the box), though you'll need a 30W or higher wall plug (not included) to take full advantage.\nEasier repairs\nIf the battery gives out completely and needs to be replaced, Pixel Watch 4 owners won't be out of luck. Google made the battery and display swappable, meaning accredited providers can handle repairs more easily (please don't try this yourself). That's a rarity in the smartwatch world, where cracking open the hardware for fixes is almost unheard of.\nPixel Watch 4 supports satellite SOS\nThe Pixel Watch 4 is the first smartwatch to support emergency satellite communication. That means even if you're completely off the grid (without a phone or cell service) the Watch 4 can still connect to a satellite to send an SOS message and share your location. It's a powerful addition to an already robust safety suite that includes fall detection, crash detection and loss-of-pulse alerts, and it could be a game-changer for outdoor athletes, frequent travelers or anyone living in areas with spotty coverage.\nUnlike Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite, which still requires an iPhone to relay messages, Google has cut out the need for a Pixel phone to be a middleman and instead handles all communication directly from the Pixel Watch 4\nLocation tracking also gets a boost thanks to dual-frequency GPS. This means more precise tracking in tough environments like dense cityscapes (where tall buildings can bounce signals) or deep wilderness trails. Satellite connectivity will be limited to LTE versions for now, while dual-band GPS will be available on LTE and Wi-Fi models."

      "text": "The Pixel 10 Pro Fold may not look too different from Google's previous foldable phone, but it does bring some key improvements to areas like battery life and durability, while maintaining perhaps the most important aspect: the price. The 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 and will be available starting Oct. 9.\nGoogle unveiled its latest foldable, along with the rest of the Pixel 10 series, at its Made by Google event in New York on Wednesday. The rest of the lineup includes the baseline Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, which have an earlier Aug. 28 release date. Like the 10 Pro Fold, the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2A hit store shelves on Oct. 9.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold build and durability\nPerhaps the most impressive feature on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is its IP68 rating. That means the phone is completely protected against dust and can be submerged in up to a meter and a half of water for 30 minutes -- the same level of particle and liquid resistance as most other premium phones.\nFoldables typically have little -- if any -- protection against granular solids; the last Pixel Fold didn't even have a rating for that, only for keeping out liquids. Samsung has also only been able to muster an IP48 rating for its Galaxy Z Fold 7, which means that phone can handle solid particles bigger than 1 millimeter but not dust. That makes Google's feat all the more impressive -- and welcome. You can hopefully take your foldable to the beach and not worry too much about sand getting in and ruining your pricey new device.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is about the same size as last year's Fold, albeit with a slightly larger 6.4-inch cover screen. The internal display remains at 8 inches. The phone is one gram heavier than the 9 Pro Fold, clocking in at 258g. The gearless hinge is designed to be more durable, Google says. The phone's front and back are made with Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, just like the 9 Pro Fold.\nBoth the cover and internal displays have a slightly higher 3,000 nits peak brightness, and a split screen mode makes it easier to multitask and quickly adjust app sizes with a tap. You can drag and drop media and files, like an image from Google Photos or a link from Chrome into Messages, essentially turning your Fold into a mini computer of sorts.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold cameras and AI\nThe camera specs match those on last year's Fold. There's a 48-megapixel wide-angle, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide and 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera, as well as 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the inner and cover screens. But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold leans heavily into new AI capabilities to boost images.\nOne of these new AI features, Camera Coach, taps Gemini to serve up tips on how to take a better shot. It might tell you to photograph your subject at a lower angle, or to work in more of the background, or even to switch to Portrait mode. I got to try out the feature at Google's campus in Mountain View, California, ahead of the Pixel 10 launch and was impressed with the tips it offered to really make subjects and architecture pop -- and I'd like to think of myself as an already good mobile photographer.\nAnother feature, Auto Best Take, builds on the feature Google debuted with the Pixel 8, but instead of manually selecting which expressions to piece together for an ideal group photo, AI will now automatically surface one image where everyone looks their best. This is the AI update I'm perhaps most excited about; when I tried the feature, I was impressed at how seamlessly it pieced together the winning shot on its own. And Add Me, which uses augmented reality and AI to seemingly include the photographer in the shot, now works on even bigger groups.\nPowering all of this is the new Tensor G5 chip. Google says it allows for a smoother user experience and boosts photo and video quality.\nIt's also what enables other on-device AI features like Magic Cue, which can pull up relevant information based on what you're doing. For example, if you're calling your airline, Magic Cue can show your flight details as soon as you dial or it might automatically bring up the address for your Airbnb when a friend asks for it.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold battery and charging\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a 5,015-mAh battery, a notable boost over the 9 Pro Fold's 4,650-mAh capacity. Google says the 10 Pro Fold can last more than 30 hours and can reach 50% charge in 30 minutes. That's something we'll be sure to check out in CNET's battery and charging tests, so stay tuned for our review.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is also Qi2 certified if you'd rather go the wireless charging route. Magnets embedded in the phone, which Google calls PixelSnap, also make it easier to snap on wireless chargers, stands and other accessories -- much like the iPhone's MagSafe connector, though it's unclear if they're similar enough for magnetic accessories to work on both.\nAn eye on practicality\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold may not have as revolutionary a design as the super-slim Galaxy Z Fold 7, but it appears to focus on the more practical, core features of a phone. According to a recent CNET survey, the top considerations when buying a new phone are price, battery life, storage and camera features.\nThe 10 Pro Fold seemingly checks all those boxes. A $1,799 price tag isn't pocket change, but at least Google didn't hike the price, as Samsung did with its book-style foldable. The 10 Pro Fold also has a higher battery capacity than both last year's fold and the Z Fold 7. Google's new phone comes with a generous 16GB of RAM and either 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage. And while the camera specs match last year's Pixel Fold, a batch of new AI features help to elevate images.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with seven years of OS and security updates to help stretch your dollars, which is the high-water mark for software security these days (Samsung also guarantees seven years of updates for its phones).\nStay tuned to CNET's ongoing coverage of the full Pixel 10 lineup in the weeks to come.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro Fold specs vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5\n| Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold | Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | Oppo Find N5 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Cover display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.4-inch OLED; 2,364x1,080 pixels; 60 to 120Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.5-inch AMOLED, 2,520x1,080p, 1 to 120Hz refresh rate | 6.62-inch OLED; 2,616x1,140 pixels; 1 to120Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Internal display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 8-inch OLED; 2,152 x 2,076 pixels; 1 to 120Hz refresh rate (LTPO) | 8-inch OLED; 2,152x2,076 pixels, 1 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate (LTPO) | 8-inch AMOLED, 2,184x1,968p, 1 to 120Hz refresh rate | 8.12-inch OLED; 2,480x2,248 pixels; 1 to 120Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | Cover: 408ppi; Internal: 373ppi | Cover: 422 ppi; Internal: 373 ppi | Cover: 422 ppi; Internal: 368 ppi | Cover: 431 ppi; Internal: 412 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | Open: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 in; Closed: 6.1 x 3 x 0.4 in | Open: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 in; Closed: 6.1 x 3 x 0.4 in | Open: 5.63 x 6.24 x 0.17 in; Closed: 2.87 x 6.24 x 0.35 in | Open: 6.3x5.77x0.16 in; Closed: 6.3x2.93x0.35 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | Open: 155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2 mm; Closed: 155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8 mm | Open: 155.2x150.2x5.1 mm; Closed: 155.2x77.1x10.5 mm | Open: 143.2 x 158.4 x 4.2mm; Closed: 72.8 x 158.4 x 8.9mm | Open: 160.87x146.58x4.21mm; Closed: 160.87x74.42x8.93mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 258g (9.1 oz) | 257g (9.1 oz) | 215g (7.58 oz.) | 229g (8.08 oz) |\n| Mobile software | Android 16 | Android 14 | Android 16 | Android 15 |\n| Cameras | 48-megapixel (wide), 10.5-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 10.5-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (telephoto) | 50-megapixel (main), 8-megapixel (ultrawide), 50-megapixel (periscope telephoto) |\n| Internal screen camera | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (outer screen) | 8-megapixel (inner screen); 8-megapixel (cover screen) |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 8K | 4K |\n| Processor | Google Tensor G5 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Snapdragon 8 Elite |\n| RAM/storage | 16GB + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB + 256GB, 12GB + 512GB, 16GB + 1TB | 16GB + 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 5,015 mAh | 4,650 mAh | 4,400 mAh | 5,600 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Yes | Side | Yes | Side |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | IP68 rating, gearless hinge, cover and internal screen 3,000 nits peak brightnes, Glass Victus 2 cover and back glass, Satellite SOS, ultra-wideband chip, Qi2-certified, free Google VPN. 7 years of OS, security and Pixel Drop updates | IPX8 rating, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, ultrawideband chip, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover and back glass, cover screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, internal screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, 21W wired fast charging (Charger not included), Qi-certified, free Google VPN, Super Res Zoom, Add Me, Face Unblur, Made You Look, Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Video Boost. 7 years of OS, security and Pixel Drop updates | One UI 8, 25W wired charging speed, Qi wireless charging, 2,600-nit peak brightness, Galaxy AI, NFC, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, IP48 water resistance | IPX9 rating, 80W fast wired charging, 50W wireless charging, nanocrystal glass cover display, anti-reflective film on inner display, cover screen peek brightness 2,450 nits, internal screen peek brightness 2,100 nits, LTPO OLED display |\n| US price starts at | $1,799 (256GB) | $1,799 (256GB) | $2,000 (256GB) | $1,870 (512GB) |"

      "text": "I've been testing the new Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, including extensively trying the 10 Pro XL's camera while roaming the streets of Paris. So far, I'm pleased with what I've seen.\nIf you're expecting a totally new generation of Google Pixel devices with the 10 Pro, you may be disappointed. The Pixel 10 Pro is an evolution of its predecessor rather than a complete overhaul. And that's fine.\nRead more: Made by Google Event 2025\nGoogle's Pixel 9 Pro impressed me when it launched last year, and it certainly doesn't require a radical transformation just one generation later. The newest Pixel model keeps the 9 Pro's slick design and awesome camera system, while the latest Android 16 software brings a host of new updates. There's also the new Tensor G5 processor, which Google says is faster and more power-efficient than the G4 chip found in last year's model.\nYes, some of the Pixel 10 Pro's new features are based around various new AI tools. The camera, in particular, increasingly incorporates AI into the way you take pictures. Whether that's good or bad is up to you to decide. At least that triple rear camera array can take stunning images, as I found out.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage costs $999, while the 10 Pro XL starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage. Both go on sale on Aug. 28. While it might seem that the XL's starting price is $100 higher than last year's model, Google eliminated the lower 128GB storage option. While you're paying more for the bigger screen, you're also getting double the storage.\nGoogle 10 Pro vs. 10 Pro XL: What's the difference?\nTo be honest, there's very little difference between the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL. They look almost identical, except for the XL model being slightly bigger. The XL model incorporates a 6.8-inch display into its larger frame, giving a bit more space to play games or watch videos than the standard 6.3-inch 10 Pro. The extra size also allows for a marginally heftier battery (5,200 mAh versus 4,870 mAh), while the XL also offers slightly faster 45-watt wired charging.\nOtherwise, the core specs are basically the same. Both models share the same Tensor G5 chip and have 16GB of RAM. The camera hardware on the back and front is identical. The choice between the two comes down to whether you prefer big-screen phones for more immersive gaming or something more pocket-friendly.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL cameras: Solid performance with AI additions\nBoth Pro models use the same rear camera setup, which includes a 50-megapixel main camera with an f/1.68 aperture, a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. While I haven't put the cameras through a full suite of tests, I took hundreds of photos with the 10 Pro XL in Paris, and I was impressed.\nPhotos from the main camera are bright, pin-sharp and vibrant. Exposure is handled extremely well, with bright skies kept under control and shadow detail clearly visible. Sometimes, images can look a little bit too HDR with unnaturally lightened shadows, but this is par for the course for most phone cameras, and I've certainly seen worse.\nThe ultrawide camera performs similarly well, with little to no color shift when swapping between lenses, which is good to see.\nThe 5x optical zoom remains an ideal sweet spot in terms of focal length, giving just enough zoom to help you find more creative compositions in whatever scene you're facing. Images are sharp and share the same spot-on handling of color and exposure as the main lens. If 5x zoom isn't enough for you, the Pixel lets you take things much further.\nYou can digitally zoom in to 10x, with the resulting image simply being slightly upscaled by the phone's software. Shots look great at this length, and continue to look decent up to 30x. Beyond this point, though, the AI takes over (Google calls it ProRes Zoom) and goes beyond simply upscaling the details. ProRes Zoom actually uses generative AI to try to recreate what it thinks should be in the scene.\nI took a variety of photos at 100x zoom, and the difference between the original image and the AI version is significant. Most of the time, it actually worked quite well, especially when I was just taking zoomed-in shots overlooking Paris, as the ProRes Zoom is optimized for static subjects like buildings and landscapes.\nI was a bit amused when I took a 100x shot of a plane going overhead. The AI recomposed it into an odd sort of bundle of sticks. However, I'm glad it didn't identify my blurry shot as a plane and simply superimpose a picture of a Boeing 737 over the top.\nThat does bring up an important question: if the phone is using generative AI to recreate details in a scene, is it really a photo that you're taking? Google is certainly trying to get ahead of some of the moral issues here in that it says this AI tool will not be applied to faces \"to prevent inaccurate representations.\"\nThe ProRes Zoom isn't the only place you'll find AI in the camera, either. Camera Coach uses AI to analyze the scene in front of you and give you a series of guided prompts on how to take a better photo. If you're taking a portrait, for example, it may suggest putting more of the person in the frame. I used it a few times on my photo walk through Paris, and I can see it being a fun tool for photography newbies to play around with. Still, it felt a bit slow and clunky to be of much use in a quicker photography scenario. Time will tell if Camera Coach becomes a genuinely useful resource for improving photography or not.\nThere's also the Auto Best Take feature, which automatically merges together the best shots of faces in a group to ensure none of your friends have their eyes closed or are squinting. Best Take was introduced on the Pixel 8 phones and required some manual work, whereas the new version does most of the work for you.\nNow, you can also use AI to edit your photos via text prompts like \"erase the crowds\" or \"fix the lighting.\" It remains to be seen how it handles my prompt to \"make me look ten years younger, slimmer, more handsome and wealthy, and also put cats everywhere.\"\nGoogle 10 Pro: Design and display\nThough the Pixel 10 Pro's design hasn't changed much since the Pixel 9 Pro, that's fine. The 9 Pro was a great-looking phone with a really slick feel, and these phones don't need to be revolutionized every single year. Google knew it had a good thing, so it's sticking with it for another generation at least.\nThe polished metal edges, frosted glass back and isolated camera bar continue to look and feel satisfyingly premium. The IP68 rating will help keep it safe from accidentally spilled drinks. The back of the phone is now magnetic, allowing its use with wireless chargers or other magnetic accessories. Google calls this Pixel Snap, but it's basically the same as Apple's MagSafe on the iPhone. It should be compatible with MagSafe and other Qi2-supported products.\nThe 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL's displays can now reach 3,300 nits peak brightness, and both looked bright and sharp during my hands-on time. While I only got to use the 10 Pro indoors, the XL's display was more than bright enough to let me take pictures under the shining midday Paris sun.\nGoogle 10 Pro: Android 16 and AI tools\nThe phones will launch with the latest Android 16, featuring various upgrades. Chief among these is the new Material 3 Expressive interface, with changes to animations, texts, icons, menu layout and other elements to give a more refined, easier-to-use experience.\nI already like the Pixel 9 Pro's stock Android look. As a result, I find the model extremely easy to use, and I'm excited by what I've seen of Android 16 so far. It's not a total overhaul, but it looks like there are a lot of subtle improvements to help make Android feel a bit more usable in everyday life. I'm looking forward to spending more time with it when I get the phone for the full review.\nAI is, unsurprisingly, a major part of the Pixel 10 Pro line, with various new AI tools being introduced. Magic Cue, for example, aims to automatically surface relevant information when you need it. Say you're texting a friend and they ask for details about the camping trip you have coming up. Magic Cue will see this request and can pull up relevant information from Gmail, such as confirmation messages for the campsite and details you two have discussed. It can share that without making you switch apps to find it yourself.\nCalling an airline to alter a booking? Magic Cue will recognize the phone number and automatically pull up your flight details so you have them ready. It certainly sounds like a helpful tool, though I do wonder exactly how useful it will be. Magic Cue only pulls info from certain Google apps (Gmail, Messages, Calendar and your screenshots), but not from third-party apps like WhatsApp or Instagram. So if you tend to mostly chat outside of Google services, its use might be more limited. As always, I'm excited to delve deeper when I get the phone in my hand.\nThere's a host of other new AI tools including a real-time voice translation tool when you're making phone calls. Existing tools like Gemini Advanced, Circle to Search and Pixel Studio (the generative-AI image maker) are also on board as standard.\nThe base Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL all run the new Tensor G5 chip, but the two Pro models also get 16GB of RAM for some extra multitasking prowess, compared to 8GB on the standard Pixel 10. How this silicon performs on our suite of benchmark tests -- as well as for gaming and other demanding uses -- remains to be seen. Google has made various boasts of the G5 chip's significant power increase, both in the CPU and GPU.\nAccording to Google, all new Pixel 10 models will receive seven years of software and security updates. That means these phones will be safe to use until at least 2032, as long as you look after them properly.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL: Battery and Qi2 charging\nEach phone should provide at least a full day of battery life. You might expect a bit more longevity from the larger battery of the XL model, but bear in mind that it also has a bigger, brighter display to power, which will suck away more of the juice over the course of the day.\nBattery life on the 9 Pro was basically average, and to be honest, that's fine if that's the case again. As long as I can make it into the evening without desperately hunting for a charger to see me to bedtime, I'm happy. Almost all phones demand a full recharge every night, and I don't expect that to change here.\nWhat is different, though, is the implementation of Qi2 technology, the latest version of the wireless charging standard that promises faster charging times when used with a compatible charger (up to 25 watts). Wired charging is faster, too, with the 10 Pro supporting 30-watt charging and the 10 Pro XL taking that further to 45 watts. Google says the XL model will go from empty to 70% full in around 30 minutes, which will certainly come in handy if you're running low on power when getting ready for a big night out.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL: Are they worth buying?\nThe new Pixel 10 Pro series isn't a big overhaul from the last generation, so those of you with a Pixel 9 Pro don't need to consider upgrading. Probably ditto for anyone with the Pixel 8 Pro.\nIf, however, you have a much older Pixel model or other Android phone -- or if you're looking for a change from Apple -- you should consider Google's new phones.\nThe design of the Pixel 10 Pro series remains slick. The cameras performed well in our early tests, and the new AI-based tools like Magic Cue appear to be genuinely useful. Throw in the faster charging speeds, long software support and promised upgrades to the overall performance, and the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are shaping up to be superb flagship Android phones.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro specs vs. Pixel 10 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 10\n| Google Pixel 10 Pro | Google Pixel 10 Pro XL | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Google Pixel 10 | |\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED;

      "text": "Key takeaways:\n- The iPhone 17 could feature a redesigned camera bump, though it may not be as drastic a difference as the Pro models.\n- A higher refresh rate could be coming to the full lineup, potentially enabling the baseline iPhone to have an always-on display.\n- Prices remain uncertain with tariffs, but they'll likely go up, given it's been years since Apple raised the price of the iPhone.\nThe anticipated reveal of Apple's newest iPhone is just weeks away. Rumors have been swirling about what the upcoming device, likely called the iPhone 17, could look like, from a redesigned camera module to fresh colors and a higher refresh rate. The phone is expected to debut in early September, although Apple hasn't confirmed anything yet. You can also check out our rumors on the iPhone 17 Pro and the thinner iPhone 17 Air.\nPerhaps the biggest looming question is whether iPhones could get pricier, especially with tariffs. President Donald Trump has said Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. This would almost certainly lead to a price hike for consumers. We'll have to wait to see how Apple responds and if shoppers really do end up shouldering that extra cost. But even without tariffs, the iPhone may be due for a markup, as it's been years since Apple raised prices on its handsets.\nHere's everything analysts and leakers predict about the baseline iPhone 17.\nSee also: Thinking About Buying a New iPhone? Here's Why You Should Wait\nCamera bump redesign\nIt's not an iPhone release without a camera upgrade, and there have been plenty of rumors about what the camera module could look like on Apple's upcoming phones. In January, a leaked image from Majin Bu on X suggested the phone could feature a pill-shaped camera bar, essentially resembling what you'd find on Google's Pixel 9 phone. In February, Bu followed up with CAD renders of what's said to be the iPhone 17 lineup, featuring horizontal camera bars, as well as larger rectangular bars on the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nIn April, Bloomberg reported the \"iPhone 17 Pro will look a lot more like the 16 Pro than anticipated,\" adding, \"From the front, the 17 Pro will appear quite similar to the 16 Pro. It's the back camera that will look meaningfully different.\" The latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro's three-lens camera arrangement will be maintained but will sit on a new panel that stretches across the phone's width and is the same color as the rest of the phone.\nLater in April, Bu again posted an image of the purported iPhone 17 lineup, showing those wider camera bars with the stacked lenses still configured to the left.\nA more recent post from August supposedly shows the full lineup, with those redesigned camera bars:\nNot until next year, for the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, will Apple be \"preparing a major shake-up\" for the phone's design, Bloomberg says. That includes a (long-rumored) foldable version and a \"bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass.\"\nAnother camera-related rumor is that the selfie camera on all iPhone 17 models will be upgraded to 24 megapixels, according to analyst Jeff Pu. That's a decent bump from the current 12-megapixel front-facing camera on the iPhone 16 lineup, although it's important to remember that more megapixels don't automatically mean better photos. Still, given how much people increasingly rely on their front cameras to snap selfies and record videos for TikTok and Instagram, this surely will be a welcome advancement.\niPhone 17 display upgrade\nThe iPhone 17 could have a slightly larger 6.3-inch display, instead of the 6.1-inch one on the iPhone 16, tipster Digital Chat Station said in June. That means it could be the same size as the iPhone 16 Pro, as well as the rumored iPhone 17 Pro, 9to5Mac reported.\nRumor has it that all models of the iPhone 17 will feature a 120Hz display, bumping the non-Pro models up from their current 60Hz refresh rate. That could be a welcome change, as the discrepancy between the Pro and non-Pro refresh rate is surprising; when Apple debuted the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus with a 60Hz display, there was a bit of an outcry from folks who expected more in 2024. This rumored update could remedy that -- and possibly bring the always-on display to the baseline model.\nThere's been a lot of back-and-forth about whether the latest iPhones will have a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective display. A July report from MacRumors suggests that feature will in fact be arriving on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, just not the baseline iPhone 17 or the Air. This would make the Pro models the first iPhones with an anti-reflective screen, giving them a feature that CNET's Patrick Holland deemed one of the best attributes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThere also have been contradictory reports on whether the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 lineup will look any different. In May, Pu said all iPhone 17 models will use a new metalens technology for the proximity sensor, which could allow Apple to reduce the size of the Face ID sensor and the Dynamic Island, according to 9to5Mac. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, on the other hand, said in January that the Dynamic Island would remain \"largely unchanged\" in the iPhone 17 lineup compared to the iPhone 16. We'll have to see what ends up being true.\nRumors on what frames the iPhone 17 lineup will feature have gone back and forth. In February, Pu suggested the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all have aluminum frames. He noted that the iPhone 17 Air could be the outlier with a titanium frame.\nNew chipset\nIn May, Pu noted the iPhone 17 would have the same A18 chip used in the iPhone 16, while the iPhone 17 Air could have an A19 chip and the Pro models would feature an A19 Pro chip.\nBut a conflicting rumor from leaker Fixed Focus Digital on Weibo suggests the baseline iPhone 17 will have an A19 chip as well. (The leaker also suggest the iPhone 17 Air could have the more advanced A19 Pro chip). Ice Universe also said the iPhone 17 will have an A19 chip, 9to5Mac reported in July.\nIt's possible the phones could also include the Apple-developed 5G modem, called the C1 chip, which debuted on the iPhone 16E.\nIn February, Kuo noted Apple will swap out Broadcom's Wi-Fi chips for in-house chips across the iPhone 17 lineup, stating this would \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices.\" It's not yet clear what exactly this would mean, but it would be interesting if Apple's C1 chip was also accompanied by its own Wi-Fi chip.\niPhone 17 battery\nSo far, rumors suggest only the pricer iPhone 17 Pro Max could get a bigger battery, according to Ice Universe. The leaker says the top-of-the-line phone could go from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max to 8.725mm on the iPhone 17 Pro Max as a result. In addition, leaker Instant Digital suggests the high-end phone could have about a 5,000 mAh battery, a notable increase over the 4,685 mAh on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, according to third-party tests.\nBut that doesn't mean the baseline version won't get any boost. Even if battery capacity stays the same (which it may not), the AI-powered Adaptive Power feature arriving with iOS 26 can help extend battery life. The feature automatically adjusts your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at the moment, according to Apple. This could especially be helpful with the slimmer iPhone 17 Air, which will likely also have a thinner battery.\niOS 26 brings a fresh look\nApple has revamped its mobile operating system with iOS 26 (not iOS 19), which is named after the last two digits of the upcoming year. And with iPadOS, MacOS, WatchOS, TVOS and VisionOS following the same naming convention, the move is designed to bring more uniformity -- naming-wise and appearance-wise -- across the operating systems.\nThe new Liquid Glass interface brings a more transparent, lens-like look to the iPhone and other Apple devices. With iOS 26, the Camera app also adopts a more minimalistic design and Photos once again makes it easier to find your albums by adding separate tabs for your Library and Collections, instead of forcing you to scroll through a single cluttered screen. Updates to Messages include being able to add backgrounds to chat windows and create polls in group chats, and a new screening tool can better detect spam texts and move messages from unknown senders to a dedicated folder. You can read more about iOS 26 features here.\nIn April, tipster Digital Chat Station noted that given the use of Apple Intelligence and AI on a \"large scale,\" the iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB of RAM, instead of the current 8GB. Kuo noted the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport that increased 12GB of RAM, but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with 8GB or 12GB of RAM. In May, Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB.\nPrice and release date\nWe expect the iPhone 17 to become available in September, although it's not yet clear exactly when, as Apple hasn't confirmed anything.\nHistorically, Apple has unveiled its new iPhones on the first Tuesday of September after Labor Day. However, the first Tuesday in 2025 is the day after Labor Day, so it's possible Apple could either push its iPhone event to Wednesday, Sept. 3, or hold it the following week on Tuesday, Sept. 9.\nThat would mean the phones could then become available on either Sept. 12 or 19. Preorders would kick off a week before general availability, on either Sept. 5 or 12.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that the new iPhone announcement should come Sept. 9 or 10.\nPrice is also a big unknown. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee has said the iPhone 17 Air, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max will get a $50 price increase to offset tariffs and the higher cost of components, but didn't mention the baseline iPhone 17. If that's true, the starting prices for the full lineup could be:\n- iPhone 17: $829\n- iPhone 17 Air: $979\n- iPhone 17 Pro: $1,049\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: $1,249\nRegardless of higher component costs or tariffs, the iPhone is overdue for a price increase, because the last price hike was five years ago.\nThe latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 could be available in black, blue, silver, purple and green.\nIn late July, Bu posted a photo on X of the predicted color lineup across the iPhone 17 series:\nWe'll continue to update this piece as more rumors surface, so be sure to follow along."

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/im-stoked-that-google-made-the-pixel-10-a-799-value-packed-feature-monster/",
      "text": "The Pixel 10 has arrived. It has a bigger battery, support for faster charging, new AI-powered tools and new cameras including one with a 5x telephoto lens (the first on a non-Pro Pixel phone). After years of Google raising the price on its standard Pixel phone, it's nice to see the company pack the Pixel 10 with features while keeping the starting price at $799, the same as last year's Pixel 9.\nThe Pixel 10, announced at the Made by Google event, builds on last year's excellent Pixel 9 design by adding new tools, like an Gemini AI-powered Camera Coach, and expanding existing ones, like raising the maximum brightness of the 6.3-inch screen to 3,000 nits.\nBut something is different about the Pixel 10.\nInstead of being a scaled down version of a Pixel Pro that costs $200 less, like the Pixel 9, the Pixel 10 is a hybrid of Google's Pro line and budget series. It has a similar body and design as the $999 Pixel 10 Pro but the same main and ultrawide cameras as the $499 Pixel 9A. I think it's smart for Google to push the Pixel 10 closer to the Pixel 9A to help differentiate it from the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL. But I will miss having those Pro cameras.\nThe Pixel 10 is available to preorder starting today and will be in stores starting Aug. 28.\nPixel 10 design, battery and processor\nThe Pixel 10 is nearly identical to the Pixel 9. The camera bar on the back defines the phone and keeps it from being a wobbly nightmare when it's laid flat on a table. The new Pixel comes in several colors: Frost, lemongrass, obsidian and indigo -- yes, that's the same deep blue hue that the original Pixel came in back in 2016. The frame is made from aluminum and has a satin finish that complements the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 polished back. The screen is also covered in Victus 2.\nThe new Pixel has a bigger battery -- 4,970 mAh -- than last year's Pixel 9 which had a 4,700-mAh battery. It will be curious to see how much of a boost the larger battery gives. Last year's Pixel 9 easily got through a busy day on a single charge, but the Pixel 10 has a brighter screen and new AI features which might cancel out any gains. I look forward to testing it out.\nThe Pixel 10 supports Qi2 wireless charging up to 15W and has magnets on back to help it ensure the correct alignment with a charger. What's nice is like Apple's MagSafe for the iPhone those magnets, which Google calls Pixelsnap, can support magnetic accessories like a wallet or grip. In theory, you should be able to use iPhone MagSafe accessories, too. I got to try out Google's Pixelsnap Ring Stand, which is both a grip and a nifty stand, and I was enthusiastic about it.\nUS models of the Pixel 10 lack a physical SIM card and instead support two active eSIMs but can store eight more. The phone runs on Google's Tensor G5 chip (the same one found in the 10 Pro) and 12GB of RAM. It comes with Android 16 out of the box and the phone looks incredible with the Material 3 Expressive design overhaul. Let's just say it's got that quirky Pixel vibe down pat.\nPixel 10 cameras\nThe Pixel 10 has three new rear cameras. There's a trio of lenses: a wide-angle, an ultrawide and a 5x telephoto. On paper, the 48-megapixel wide-angle camera and the 13-megapixel ultrawide seem identical to the cameras on Pixel 9A. It's not that those cameras are bad -- I've gotten some wonderful images from the Pixel 9A -- it's that the Pixel 10 feels a bit less special without having the same wide and ultrawide cameras found on the Pixel 10 Pro. I should also remind myself that Google's photo processing pipeline has much more to do with the Pixel's reputation for taking excellent phone photos than the actual lens and sensor hardware.\nExpanding the phone's rear cameras from two to three should make a lot of people happy. This makes the Pixel 10 more competitive with Samsung's Galaxy S25 which also has three rear cameras. And it upstages the iPhone 16 which just has two rear cameras. More cameras aren't necessarily better, but I'm excited to see what it's like to use them.\nAround the front, is a 10.5-megapixel selfie camera.\nPixel 10 AI and Gemini\nGoogle's latest Pixel comes with a bunch of AI tools and goodies. There's a new Gemini-powered Camera Coach which can give you a mini step-by-step tutorial on how to take a better photo. It makes suggestions like having you step closer to your subject or changing your framing to help you grab a better image. This seems aimed at someone who wants to improve their photography skills or slow down and really concentrate on being in the moment and getting the best photo. There's even a Get Inspired option which really gave me some suggestions that I would have never thought to try.\nBest Take debuted on the Pixel 8 and uses a series of images of a group photo to find the \"best\" expression for each person in the picture. When I first tried it in 2023, I called it face swap, because that's what it's kind of doing. The idea is that friend who always has their eyes closed in a group shot can have their \"face replaced\" with another image in the series where their eyes are open. On the Pixel 10, this all happens automatically so you don't need to worry about having enough images to swap faces.\nThen there's Magic Cue which can pull up relevant information off your phone based on what you're doing. For example, if a friend is asking for the address for your Airbnb it will surface that info so you don't need to go digging for it. Out of all the AI features on the Pixel 10 series, I am most intrigued by Magic Cue. If it works as advertised I can see it being a valuable way to save time and minimize the stress of searching for things on your phone.\nLike the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel 10 has Gemini integrated into it. I half-joked last year that Google was going to change the name of its phones from Pixel to Gemini. The same is true this year.
