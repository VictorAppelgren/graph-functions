Demand for our innovative digital, artificial intelligence and cloud transformation solutions remains robust, along with continued strong demand for our services in the defense sector, underscoring the effectiveness of our strategic direction and the dedication of our team in delivering measurable results.\n\nIn the United States, our first half results reflected approximately 9% year over year revenue growth, driven by agreements executed in late 2024 and in early 2025. These initiatives, alongside expanding activity with existing customers, position us well for additional U.S. growth through the remainder of the year.\n\nIn March, we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding to enter into negotiations for the contemplated merger of Magic into Matrix I.T., a transformational landmark in Magic\u2019s evolution.

Magic Software\u2019s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company\u2019s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures are used in financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to the Company\u2019s board of directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company\u2019s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\n\nManagement of the Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP results. Magic Software urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company\u2019s business.\n\nNon-GAAP measures used in this press release are included in the financial tables of this release. These non-GAAP measures exclude the following items:\n\u2022 Amortization of purchased intangible assets and other related costs;\n\u2022 Costs related to acquisition of new businesses;\n\u2022 The related tax, non-controlling interests\u2019 effects of the above items;\n\u2022 Change in valuation of contingent consideration related to acquisitions;\n\nReconciliation of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included in the financial tables of this release.\n\nMagic Software Enterprises Ltd. (NASDAQ and TASE: MGIC) is a global provider of end-to-end integration and application development platforms solutions and IT consulting services.\n\nSome of the statements in this press release may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
