  "title": "Like it or not, your Pixel will now lower your headphones' loud audio",
  "description": "Google's new \"Hearing Wellness\" feature for Pixel devices actively lowers your headphones' volume to prevent ear damage.",
  "content": "Continued exposure to loud volumes is linked with potential permanent ear damage, and with the prevalence of in-ear wireless earbuds, concerns about hearing loss have been rising. Therefore, Google wants to prevent that from happening to you and is adding a feature that will frequently remind you to lower your earphones\u2019 volume. If you don\u2019t act, it will reduce the volume itself.\n\nThe new Hearing Wellness feature has been added under the Sound & vibration settings on all Pixel devices. It was originally introduced in Android 14 QPR beta 1 and is now rolling out to all Pixel phones running Android 15 and above. With the feature enabled, your Pixel will send you a notification when the output of your headphones exceeds a certain safe threshold.\n\nAccording to a Google support page, this threshold is set to the sound pressure limit of 100 decibels over five minutes or 105dB per minute. When that happens, you will see an alert pop up on your Pixel phone, asking you to \u201cKeep listening\u201d or \u201cLower the volume.\u201d\n\nGoogle adds that these alert notifications are turned on by default on Pixel devices and cannot be turned off. Further, if you simply dismiss the notification, the feature will automatically lower the volume.\n\nThe latter feature is locked behind another toggle that may be disabled for some regions. It is because the alerts have been put in place following recommendations by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The specific guidelines for healthy sound pressure levels were added in the third edition of IEC 62368-1 safety standards published by the body, and adopted in regions including the US, Canada, and the EU.\n\nGoogle says the settings are therefore locked as part of regulatory requirements, as seen in the images above. Despite that, it is bound to annoy users who like to blast audio at full volume, and we\u2019ve already come across a few instances of criticism from users.",

      "text": "The established safety standards for ICT equipment (60950-1) and AV equipment (60065) are to be phased out in favor of a single standard, 62368-1, in North America and the EU. The new standard introduces a different, hazard-based philosophy to product testing. What does it mean for product certification, and how can OEMs best manage the transition?\nIEC 62368-1 - An Overview\nIEC 62368-1 2nd Edition, the hazard-based product-safety standard for ICT and AV equipment, is set to supersede the outgoing IEC 60950-1 for ICT equipment and IEC 60065 for AV equipment.\nThe move is more significant than a simple merger or name change, because 62368-1 adopts fundamentally different engineering principles and terminologies. In addition, some existing products that comply with 60950-1 or 60065 will need to be re-investigated to achieve certification.\nTo help product manufacturers manage the transition, the American and European bodies have harmonized the date from which the 60950-1 and 60065 standards will cease and 62368-1 will take over. Following a recent update to the EU's Official Journal (OJ) of legislation, and subsequent announcement by UL in the USA, the new date is December 20, 2020.\nAnother important aspect is that, like the outgoing standards, 62368-1 applies not only to the end-user product but also to components and subsystems such as power supplies. Product manufacturers need to bear this in mind to be sure of procuring acceptable parts throughout the transition period between now and December 2020, and in the subsequent period when only 62368-1 will apply.\nThis paper aims to help manufacturers of affected products manage the transition and ensure continued compliance, by explaining the reasons for the new standard and its governing principles, the provisions built in to assist transition, and how best to ensure procured components like power supplies will satisfy its requirements.\nIEC 62368-1 Timing\nDecember 20, 2020 represents an important date for companies marketing audio-visual products or computing/communications equipment in North America (i.e. USA and Canada) and the EU. The safety standards that historically have applied to these products, IEC 60065 and IEC 60950-1 respectively, will transition to IEC 62368-1.\nIn North America, December 20, 2020 is the UL Effective Date. UL will proceed with a soft transition, whereby new submissions for certification will be investigated against UL/CSA 62368-1, but existing products certified to the legacy standards will not be subjected to an Industry File Review (IFR).\nIn Europe, the transition will be more abrupt as the outgoing standards are withdrawn in favor of the new EN 62368-1 standard, and presumptions of conformity with directives that reference the old standards will also cease.\nThe intention has always been to harmonize the dates, so that manufacturers could plan and align their certification strategies for these two major markets of the world. Recently, a potential anomaly arose, as CENELEC extended the Date of Withdrawal (DoW) for the 60950-1 and 60065 standards in Europe to December 20, 2020, although the EU Official Journal was not updated at the same time. The problem lay with wording in the OJ (a legal document that takes precedence over the documentation for the standards) relating to the EU's Low-Voltage Directive (LVD) allowing presumption of conformity for products that meet EN 60950-1 or EN 60065. In the OJ, the date of cessation of this presumption was June 20, 2019, which historically had been the same as the Date of Withdrawal of the outgoing standards.\nIn Europe, separating the DoW and the date of cessation of conformity introduced confusion about the status of EN 62368-1. From the American point of view, the separation prevented complete harmonization of the US Effective Date (from which UL 62368-1 will supersede UL 60950-1 and UL 60065 and they will be withdrawn) and the EU's DoW/cessation of presumption of conformity.\nOn June 15, 2018, the date for cessation of presumption of conformity in the LVD was extended to December 20, 2020 in the EU's Official Journal. This move had been expected, to clarify the status of EN 62368-1. Upon publication of the revised date, UL in America announced the extension of the US Effective Date, once again harmonizing the schedules for both markets.\nThe Status of 62368-1 in the US, EU, and Other Territories\nAs a single harmonized safety standard, IEC 62368-1 has been the work-in-progress of IEC Technical Committee TC108 since 2002. It is worth noting that TC108 is also responsible for IEC 60950-1 and IEC 60065, and has implemented changes in the latest editions of both to ease the transition to the new standard.\nFollowing publication of the first edition of IEC 62368-1, in 2010, the North American Bi-National CSA/UL 62368-1 Ed. 1 was adopted in February 2012. At that time, the EU did not follow suit, but subsequently adopted the second edition as EN 62368-1 Ed. 2 in August 2014. CSA/UL 62368-1 Ed. 2 has been adopted in North America since December 2014. The Third Edition is expected to be published sometime in 2019, with the implementation date likely occurring in 2022.\nAlthough the North American and European standards bodies have already published their national equivalents (UL/CSA 62368-1 and EN 62368-1), committees in other regions are still evaluating adoption of 62368-1, including China, Korea, and South America. Mexico has implemented NMX-I-62368-1-NYCE-2015 on a voluntary basis. Japan published JIS C 62368-1:2018 in January 2018, based on IEC 62368-1:2014 Edition 2, and will take about a year to fully adopt it into law. The Australia/New Zealand standards authorities published AS/NZS 62368.1:2018, also based on IEC 62368-1:2014 Edition 2, in February 2018.\nCurrently, then, the 62368-1, 60950-1 and 60065 standards are active in both North America and Europe. Although the situation may sound complicated, the standards have been allowed to coexist to help the industry transition to the new standard as smoothly and cost-effectively as possible.\nWith the DoW for both 60950-1 and 60065 drawing close, manufacturers that have not yet engaged with the new standard are advised to do so now to ensure certifications to the new standard are secured in time.\nReasons for the Change to 62368-1\nAs a unified replacement for 60950-1 (for ICT equipment) and 60065 (for AV equipment), 62368-1 represents more than just a merger of the two standards. The move is the latest evolution of Hazard Based Safety Engineering which has become the new approach as new types of affordable products have emerged for use in small and home offices, and for home entertainment.\nWith continued development of new technologies and new markets, the distinctions between AV and ICT equipment have become increasingly blurred - multimedia products provide just one example. A single harmonized standard aims to give a clearer framework to evaluate the safety of these products.\nIn addition, 62368-1 plans to give product designers more flexibility, in product design and evaluation and to keep pace with technology without requiring frequent (expensive and time-consuming) revisions. To this end it adopts the above mentioned modern Hazard Based Safety Engineering (HBSE) principles, which replace the traditional prescriptive approach of 60950-1 and 60065, although prescriptive options are also offered.\nScope of the New 62368-1 Standard\n62368-1 applies to all equipment currently subject to 60950-1 and 60065 safety standards, and further products are to be brought within its scope.\nClause 1 describes the scope of the standard, while Annex A contains a list of product types covered. Currently, these include:\n- Computing and networking products such as servers, PCs, routers, notebook/laptop computers, tablets and their power supplies\n- Consumer electronics such as amplifiers, home theater systems, digital cameras and personal music players\n- Displays and display units including monitors, TVs and digital projectors\n- Telecommunication products such as network infrastructure equipment, cordless and cell phones, and similar communication devices, including battery-powered devices\n- Office appliances like copiers and document shredders\n- Various other types of audio/video, information and communication technology equipment used in homes, schools, data processing centers, and commercial and professional environments\nAs with both 60065 and 60950-1, the examples provided in Annex A are not exhaustive, and equipment not listed is not necessarily excluded. Edition 3 of IEC 62368-1 is expected to include additional examples of equipment that has entered widespread use since the earlier standards were published. These could include smartphones, tablet computers, wearable computers, electronic kiosks and even 3D printers.\nHow the Scope of 62368-1 Affects Power Supplies\n62368-1 applies not only at the product level but also \u2013 where relevant - to components and subsystems. This is the same situation that prevailed under 60950-1 and 60065, so companies that source third-party subsystems such as power supplies should inquire with the manufacturer to establish if the product is currently or has plans to be certified to 62368-1. This applies to units installed inside the equipment, such as chassis mount power supplies, as well as to external power supplies or adapters that are simply procured and shipped in the box with the equipment.\nAiding the Transition to 62368-1\nSecond Edition of 62368-1 contains clauses designed to help companies manage their transition from the legacy standards. These effectively help companies decide how and when to certify their products to 62368-1, and to manage existing inventory of subsystems and components (like power supplies) that are already certified to 60950-1 and 60065.\nAn important - although, it must be noted, temporary - provision is the sub-clause 4.1.1, which enables companies to continue using their inventory of 60950-1 or 60065 parts in products certified to 62368-1. The clause states:\nIn the case of a Listed power supply, for example, due consideration can be as simple as ensuring the product is only used within its established electrical ratings.\nReaders familiar with the requirements of 60950-1 and 60065 may have spotted the potential for some problems because the legacy standards classify energy sources and circuits differently. One example is that a 60950-1 certified switched-mode power supply typically has output circuits classified as safety extra-low voltage (SELV), whereas IEC 62368-1 refers to ES1 energy sources, which considers both voltage and current. As a result, SELV is no longer defined.\nAlthough this is true, TC108 has taken a pragmatic approach to the issue, and has recognized that a SELV circuit is intended to be safe to touch by a user or operator, in the same way that an ES1 source is safe to touch by an ordinary person (see the section on \"Hierarchy of 62368-1 Safeguards\" for more information on user classifications). To aid transition to the new standard, the two are regarded as offering equivalent levels of safety. Hence, interconnection of 60950-1 SELV circuits and 62368-1 ES1 circuits is considered acceptable in practice without exhaustive analysis.\nNote that sub-clause 4.1.1 is expected to be removed from future editions of 62368-1. TC108 has considered recommending that the provisions should be extended into Edition 3, which is currently being reviewed for publication. However, the European committee CENELEC intends to remove the legacy component provision 4.1.1 from Edition 2 of EN 62368-1, due to come into effect December 20, 2020, and has stated that it will not be featured in Edition 3, no matter the result of the TC108 discussion. UL, on the other hand, will maintain acceptance of 60950-1 or 60065 for legacy products after the 2020 date of withdrawal as long as significant changes involving safety of critical components are not made to the specific parts in question. Hence, companies must take these regional differences into consideration when preparing their transition plan to the 62368-1 standard.\nHazard Based Safety Engineering Principles as Applies in 62368-1\nTo safeguard flexibility for designers at the same time as ensuring safety for end users, 62368-1 incorporates HBSE concepts. As a safety science discipline, HBSE has been formalized over the last 25 years to move product-safety legislation towards a performance-oriented philosophy which is more flexible (from standards-makers' and designers' perspectives) and effective (as regards to end-user safety) than prescriptive approaches. HBSE philosophy was ingrained in the ECMA-287 Safety of Electronic Equipment standard published in 2002, which was passed to the Hazard-Based Standard Development Team (HBSDT) of the IEC's TC108 technical committee. TC108, among other IEC committees, has been committed to HBSE since the same period, and maintains several hazard sub-teams focused on electric shock, fire, mechanical, chemical, radiation and other hazards for various product types and safety standards.\nFundamentally, HBSE seeks to identify potential hazards as energy sources capable of causing pain or injury to users and identify suitable means of preventing such energy transfer.\nThe logic underlying HBSE can be summarized as follows:\n- Identify the energy sources used\n- Measure the energy levels they produce\n- Determine whether the energy from the sources is hazardous\n- Classify it accordingly\n- Identify how energy can be transferred to a body part\n- Determine appropriate safeguard schemes:\n- To protect defined persons against pain and injury from the classified energy sources, as well as\n- To reduce the likelihood of injury or property damage due to an electrically caused fire originating within the equipment\n- Measure the effectiveness of those safeguards\nHBSE visualizes the hazards and safeguards in terms of three-block models that describe the links between energy source, energy-transfer mechanism (figure 1) or safeguard (figure 2), and the user.\nIn addition to considering bodily injury, 62368-1 also applies the HBSE three-block model to analyze the potential for electrically caused fire resulting in damage to persons or property. Recognizing the need for a fuel to be present, if ignition is to occur, the three-block model is expressed in figures 3 and 4.\nMoreover, 62368-1 references all energy sources applicable to ICT/AV electrical equipment. These encompass electrical energy, thermal energy such as hot accessible parts, chemical energy encompassing electrolytic reactions or poisons, kinetic energy such as moving parts, and radiated energy including optical or acoustic energy.\nEnergy sources are classified into one of three levels according to magnitude and duration, as an expression of their potential to cause harm. Figure 5 describes these classifications in relation to potential for bodily harm and fire risk.\n| Energy Source | Effect on the Body | Effect on Combustible Materials |\n|---|---|---|\n| Class 1 | Not painful, but may be detectable | Ignition not likely |\n| Class 2 | Painful, but not an injury | Ignition possible, but limited growth and spread of fire |\n| Class 3 | Injury | Ignition likely, rapid growth and spread of fire |\nObservations on 62368-1 Energy Classifications\nNo employed safeguard could be an option against class 1 energy sources, and the level of energy remains below specified class 1 limits under normal operating conditions, abnormal conditions, or in the presence of a single fault.\nAs far as class 2 energy sources are concerned, energy levels exceed class 1 limits but remain below class 2 limits during normal, abnormal or single-fault conditions. The energy present may be sufficient to cause pain but is not likely to cause injury. For fire analysis, the energy could be enough to cause ignition under some conditions. At least one safeguard is required to protect ordinary users from class 2 energy sources.\nClass 3 energy sources are the most hazardous. The energy exceeds the class 2 maximum limit under normal, abnormal or single-fault conditions. Class 3 sources can cause injury, or ignition and spread of fire. The type of injury caused by a class 3 energy source may be fibrillation, cardiac/respiratory arrest, or skin and/or internal organ burn. A double or reinforced safeguard is required to protect an ordinary person from class 3 energy sources.\nFigures 6 and 7, relating to electrically caused injury and electrically caused fire, enable an intuitive understanding of classification of energy sources, and the safeguards required. The actual current and voltage limits applicable to ES1, ES2 and ES3 vary. For example, the voltage limit requirements are influenced by frequency. For voltages below 1 kHz, the ES1 limit is 30 Vrms, 42.4 Vp, and 60 Vdc. The ES2 limit is 50 Vrms, 70.7 Vp, and 120 Vdc. Equipment must comply with either the voltage limit or current limit specified in the applicable energy class but does not have to comply with both. The limits also vary according to normal or abnormal operation, or a single-fault condition. The limits are detailed in clause 5 of the standard. There are also sub-clauses, such as 5.2.2.5, which detail the limits for pulse waveforms, according to off-time. TC108 plans to remove 5.2.2.5 from Edition 3 of IEC 62368-1.\nHierarchy of 62368-1 Safeguards\n62368-1 makes provision for several kinds of safeguards, and defines a hierarchy ranging from basic safeguards at the lowest level, supplementary safeguards that become operational if the basic safeguard fails, double safeguards (such as double insulation), and reinforced safeguards, which are single safeguards that offer protection equivalent to that of a double safeguard.\nAmong the types of safeguards considered when developing a protection strategy, equipment safeguards are designed in and include protective earthing, electrical enclosures, fire enclosures, insulation or other protective features. There is also a provision for installation of safeguards, such as bonding to an external earth, as well as instructional safeguards such as safety marking. In addition, the standard references precautionary safeguards, which cover instances where users are instructed by skilled persons, and skills safeguards that permit reliance on the abilities of skilled persons to protect themselves against the hazards presented by class 2 and class 3 energy sources.\nWhile the hazard-based approach that underpins 62368-1, and some of the terminology used, differs significantly from the approaches of 60950-1 and 60065, designers familiar with the older standards will recognize the distinctions between types of users. The term \"ordinary person\" in 62368-1 is equivalent to \"user/operator,\" and \"skilled person\" is equivalent to \"service person.\" 62368-1 also defines the category \"instructed person,\" which applies to those who have been instructed and trained - or are to be supervised \u2013 by a skilled person.\nSummary of the 62368-1 HBSE Approach\nThe hazard-based approach to safety analysis replaces the prescriptive approach adopted by each of the legacy standards. The basic intention of 62368-1 is to give designers greater flexibility to design safety measures in keeping with their products, while at the same time requiring rigorous analysis to ensure that all products are safe to use and cannot cause bodily injury or fire.\nHBSE principles enable 62368-1 to support the introduction of new and innovative methods of construction and technology without first needing to be amended.\nAs a further advantage, the HBSE approach should help to minimize differences between published national/regional equivalents of the standard.\nAssessing Accessibility of Energy Sources\nSome new test equipment is expected to be needed, to allow proper investigation of products. One key difference between the legacy standards and 62368-1 is the provision for a new type of probe for testing accessibility. A standard set of probes are used to assess the physical accessibility of energy sources within the product, and so determine whether one or more safeguards are needed. Annex 5 of 62368-1 describes the test methods used for determining accessibility and includes provisions for a new unjointed version of the standard articulated probe, for determining whether a part can be accessed by children.\nWhat to Do Next\nFor companies that have not embarked on the journey to understand the implications of 62368-1, and ensure continued marketability of current and future products, it is vital to begin preparing now. Studying the standard is essential, and supporting publications are also available to aid understanding.\nTo gain an overview of 62368-1, and its history, objectives and approaches, Clause 0 of the currently published standard presents an informative primer.\nIn addition, the document IEC/TR 62368-2, Ed. 2, \"Audio/video, information and communication technology equipment - Part 2: Explanatory information related to IEC 62368-1\" provides extra background and explanations of certain sub-clauses. This can be purchased online from the IEC store and elsewhere.\nNavigating the New Standard\nChange is coming. Like any new standard, the best response is to understand the reasons it has emerged, get inside, know all about it, and how best to work with it. By understanding what you must and must not do, you can make sure you are among the OEMs that are in a stronger position going forward, while leveraging the provisions of the new standard to deliver products that are in compliance."

Learn more.\nFCC mandates all mobile phones in the US to be compatible with hearing aids\nOctober 18, 2024\n- The FCC has approved a regulation requiring 100% of all mobile handsets sold in the US to be compatible with hearing aids.\n- The rule requires phone makers to abandon proprietary Bluetooth coupling standards and meet new volume control requirements.\n- Phone makers are also urged to change their packaging to indicate hearing aid compatibility on their devices.\nThe FCC has adopted a new regulation that will require all smartphones to be compatible with hearing aid devices. The commission says that with the new mandate, 48 million Americans with hearing loss will be able to choose from the same mobile phone models available to everybody.\n\u201cUnder the new rules, after a transition period, Americans with hearing loss will no longer be limited in their choice of technologies, features, and prices available in the mobile handset marketplace,\u201d the FCC noted in a press release.\nThe regulation requires all phone makers to abandon proprietary Bluetooth coupling standards that may interfere with hearing aid compatibility. The FCC will require all handsets to ensure universal connectivity between smartphones and hearing aids, including over-the-counter devices like the recently approved Apple AirPods Pro 2.\nMoreover, the rule mandates that all new mobile handsets available in the US meet volume control benchmarks that ensure clear audio for listeners by allowing them to increase the audio volume without introducing distortion.\n\u201cSuch requirements accommodate consumers with hearing loss who do not use hearing aids as well as those that rely on hearing aids or cochlear implants,\u201d the FCC said.\nAdditionally, phone makers will have to revise their labels and websites to indicate hearing aid compatibility, whether or not the handset meets telecoil or Bluetooth coupling requirements, and how high the handset\u2019s audio volume can be raised while meeting the new volume control requirements.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "When you\u2019re jamming out to your favorite beats using a nice pair of wired earbuds or headphones, it\u2019s tempting to crank up the volume as high as possible so you can fully immerse yourself in the music. But if you listen to music at excessively high volumes for prolonged periods of time, eventually, you might irreversibly damage your hearing. That\u2019s why experts recommend limiting your exposure to loud noises. Android has long had a safety feature that warns you when you try to raise the media volume above a safe limit, but this warning can be easily ignored. Android 14 will be more proactive in protecting your hearing with its new headphone loud sound alert feature.\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t familiar, Android devices sold in the EU display a warning when headphones are connected and the user tries to raise the output volume level above 85 dB. You can accept the warning and increase the output volume level to a maximum of 100 dB, but the warning will reappear after 20 hours of music playback to remind you of the potential danger to your hearing.\nThe European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) adopted the IEC 62368-1 safety standard for audio/video devices sold in the EU. Android\u2019s safe media volume warning follows the recommendations outlined in this document, which has undergone multiple revisions over the years. The most recent was adopted earlier this year, so in order to keep up with the latest recommendations, Google is adding a new safety feature in Android 14 that warns you when you\u2019ve been listening to music at unsafe volume levels for too long.\nThis feature, called \"headphone loud sound alert,\" was mentioned at Google I/O 2023 during the \u201cWhat\u2019s new in Android Accessibility\u201d session. Google says that with this alert enabled in Android 14, \u201cyou can be notified for excessive long hours of audio consumption with high volume on your headphones.\u201d Google didn\u2019t elaborate much more at the time, but I\u2019ve been tracking this feature since I first caught wind of it months ago. Fast-forward to today, and I now have a more complete understanding of how it works, thanks to Google\u2019s latest source code release.\nHow Android 14's headphone loud sound alert feature works\nWith the release of the SDK 34 source code, I was able to find Google\u2019s description for how the headphone loud sound alert feature works under-the-hood. Apparently, the feature operates with \u201ccomputed sound doses\u201d (CSDs) in contrast to a fixed volume index. Android performs a \u201cfrequency-dependent analysis\u201d of the audio signal to estimate \u201chow loud and potentially harmful the signal content is.\u201d This analysis is combined \u201cwith the volume attenuation/amplification applied to it and integrated over time to derive the dose exposure over a 7 day rolling window.\u201d\nAndroid 14 has different warnings for when the CSD reaches certain thresholds. There are warnings for a \u201cmomentary exposure\u201d as well as \u201c1X\u201d and \u201c5X\u201d the CSD you can \u201csafely listen to in a week over headphones. The exact UI behaviors implemented by Android are \u201cdefined in IEC 62368 in \u2018Safeguards against acoustic energy sources\u2019\u201d. This specific document costs hundreds of dollars to obtain, but thanks to a source, I was able to get my hands on it. I also did the sane thing and put on a YouTube video that plays an air horn sound for 10 hours (WARNING: VERY LOUD) to see what the actual warnings look like in Android 14.\nAt 1X, 2X, 3X, and 4X the CSD, Android posts a notification that reads \u201cvolume lowered to safer level. Headphone volume has been high for longer than recommended.\u201d At 5X the CSD, Android posts a notification that reads \u201cvolume lowered to safer level. Headphone volume has exceeded the safe limit for this week.\u201d As for the \u201cmomentary exposure\u201d notification, it reads \u201cloud sound detected. Headphone volume has been higher than recommended, which can damage your hearing.\u201d\nAndroid 14's warning when the computed sound dose (CSD) has reached \"1X\", \"2X\", \"3X\", and \"4X\" the recommended level. (left); the warning when the CSD reaches \"5X\" the recommended level (right)\nIt took hours of playback to trigger each 1X-5X warning on my Pixel 6a running Android 14 connected to a pair of wired USB-C earphones \u2014 about 3 hours for each subsequent warning to appear, in fact. The exact time it takes to trigger these warnings depends on how loud the sound signal is calculated to be, of course. Android measured the sound level of the air horn video to be around 93 dB, so it wasn\u2019t even loud enough for the momentary exposure warning to show. I had to use a different audio file to trigger that warning, as shown below. (You can see Android\u2019s calculations of the sound level through the Settings.Global.audio_safe_csd_dose_records value.)\nAndroid's \"momentary exposure\" warning, which is triggered when the sound level is computed to be over 100 dB\nIf you\u2019re wondering, no, Android does not track the sound dose for music played over Bluetooth speakers or headphones, as the actual sound level of these devices can be set independently of the Android device. I verified this by tracking the change over time in Settings.Global.audio_safe_csd_current_value, which holds the current value of the CSD. This value would only increment for me when I played the air horn video while connected to my USB-C earphones, and not my Bluetooth headphones.\nIf you\u2019re also wondering about the exact sound levels over time that trigger these warnings, it should work as follows: Momentary exposure happens when the sound level is \u2265 100 dB. 1X CSD, apparently also referred to as \u201cRS2\u201d in the document, is when the sound level exceeds 80 dB for a 40-hour period. The document says that users should be warned for every 100% increase in CSD, which is why Android shows the same warning at 2X, 3X, and 4X the CSD. If the user doesn\u2019t acknowledge these warnings, Android will lower the volume output level to \u201cRS1\u201d, which refers to when the average sound pressure is below 85 dB.\nWhat devices will Android 14's headphone loud sound alert appear on?\nAs I previously mentioned, Google is adding this feature to comply with regulatory requirements in the EU. That\u2019s why Android 14\u2019s headphone loud sound alert feature isn\u2019t enabled by default. Since I live in the US, I had to manually enable it in order to trigger the warnings. Here\u2019s how Android determines whether to enable the feature:\n- Is the system property \"audio.safemedia.csd.force\" set to true? This property forces the feature to be enabled regardless of other factors. This is likely only used for testing and/or devices sold strictly within the EU.\n- Is the DeviceConfig value \"enable_csd\" under the media namespace set to true? This property can be remotely overridden by Google Play Services. My guess is that Google will flip this flag for devices operating in the EU.\n- Is the \"config_safe_sound_dosage_enabled\" flag set to true in the framework? This flag was set to true in Android 14 Beta 2, which is why some users saw these warnings, but it\u2019s been set to false in every subsequent Android 14 beta.\nDoesn't Android/Samsung already have this feature?\nBefore I finish, I need to address something that I know people will bring up if I don\u2019t. No, Android did not already have this feature. You\u2019re confusing it with the safe media volume limit feature that I already talked about in this article. That one warns the user when they try to raise the volume above a fixed volume index, whereas the new feature warns the user if they\u2019ve been listening to music for a while at a volume level above the recommended computed sound dose of the audio signal.\nVolume monitor in One UI 5.1.1 on the Galaxy Z Fold 5.\nThe second point is about whether other OEMs, namely Samsung, already have this feature. Yes, Samsung already has a similar feature, but many of you were also confusing the safe media volume limit feature in One UI with the feature described in this article. Samsung\u2019s version of this feature is disabled by default in One UI in many regions. It can be found under Settings > Digital wellbeing and parental controls > Volume monitor.\nAndroid 14 will be hitting stable in just a few more weeks, and as always we'll see updates for existing phones trickle out over the months to follow."

      "text": "Android 14 provides support for sound dose in the audio framework and Audio HAL by continuously monitoring sound dose measurements and issuing warnings to users about damaging exposure levels.\nSound dose is a measurement of sound pressure levels over a period of time. By monitoring sound dose, we can help protect users from the damaging effects of excessive or prolonged sound exposure, thus offering better hearing protection when using headphones on portable Android devices and minimizing the chance of a hearing impairment.\nThe new standards for safe listening devices conform to the regulatory requirements for hearing protection in IEC62368-1 3rd edition (requires login) and EN50332-3 (access limited to subscribers), which introduce the concept of sound dose.\nThe sound dose function lets OEMs follow the new hearing safety regulations. To support sound dose, OEMs must follow interface specifications and regulations for all customizations and certifications. A customized OEM implementation can bypass or modify the AOSP default implementation of sound dose. However, using the AOSP implementation is highly recommended.\nSound dose calculation\nThe standards in IEC62368-1 3rd edition and EN50332-3 increase the accuracy of measuring sound exposure by computing the calculated sound dose (CSD). CSD is computed by integrating momentary exposure levels (MEL) over time. A seven-day continuously rolling window of accumulated CSD values is maintained for the sound dose computation.\nIn accordance with section 10.6.3.2 of IEC62368-1 3rd edition, if the CSD value reaches the 100% limit, the system alerts the user about the sound levels on each increase of 100%. If the user doesn\u2019t acknowledge the warning, the volume lowers to the predefined radiation energy source class 1 (RS1) value of Table 39 of IEC62368-1.\nAs mentioned in section 10.6.3.3 of IEC62368-1 3rd edition, along with the sound dose warnings the system must initiate an exposure-based warning every time the MEL value exceeds the radiation energy source class 2 (RS2) value of Table 39 of IEC62368-1.\nFor certification with these regulations and to make the CSD values more relevant, the system must use accurate output values as perceived by the users (such as the media playback output). It's important for the CSD computation to use values that are close to the actual sound pressure levels to which the user is exposed.\nArchitecture\nDepending on where the frames are captured, hardware characteristics and effects of the transducers can influence the power level of the rendered frames. To have a precise output sound pressure level measurement, we extended the HAL to get the MEL values directly from the underlying hardware and account for possible effects that are applied by the digital signal processor (DSP) or speaker properties, such as impedance, sensitivity, and frequency response.\nIf the HAL can\u2019t provide MEL values, as a fallback mechanism, the audio framework analyzes and computes CSD. This computation in the audio framework is based on the information about the rendered output reported from HAL, and frames that are sent to the audio DSP.\nSound dose introduces two components, SoundDoseHelper\nand\nSoundDoseManager,\nas shown in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Architectural components of the sound dose feature.\nSoundDoseHelper\nThe SoundDoseHelper\nclass, which lives in the systemserver\nprocess, is the\nmain collection point for all relevant sound dosing data. The AudioService\nclass manages the SoundDoseHelper\nclass.\nThe SoundDoseHelper\nclass is responsible for the following:\n- Handling new dosage information\n- Persisting sound dose values\n- Recovering state in case of\naudioserver\ncrash - Triggering System UI notifications\n- Lowering volume\nSoundDoseManager\nThe SoundDoseManager\nclass, which lives in the audioserver\nprocess and is\npart of the AudioFlinger\nclass, collects the sound dose data from the HAL or computes it internally, as a\nfallback, from the frames sent to the HAL. The SoundDoseManager\nclass sends\nthe sound dose data to the SoundDoseHelper\nclass.\nMelProcessor and MelAggregator\nIf the HAL can't provide MEL values, the MelProcessor\nand MelAggregator\nutilities in libaudioutils\nare used for the internal sound dose computation.\nIn the MelProcessor\nclass, the main computation is performed on a buffer with\naudio samples by calling MelProcessor::process(const void* buffer, size_t bytes)\n.\nOEMs can use MelProcessor\nin their HAL implementation if needed.\nThe MelAggregator\nclass receives the MEL values from different audio ports and\ncalculates the CSD value with a rolling window of seven days. The method MelAggregator::aggregateAndAddNewMelRecord_l(MelRecord mel)\nexecutes the logic. The results are sent to the SoundDoseManager\nclass for\ncommunication with AudioService\n.\nImplementation\nHIDL interface extensions are deprecated starting with Android 14,\nso the new HAL interface for retrieving computed MEL values and issuing exposure\nwarnings, named ISoundDose\n,\nis defined as part of the AIDL Audio HAL. However,\nfor implementers that need more time to integrate the AIDL Audio HAL, we have a\nstandalone sound dose AIDL HAL, which offers the\nISoundDoseFactory\ninterface. This will be\ndeprecated in the future.\nThe HAL methods for sound dose support are shown in the following code sample:\n/**\n* This interface provides functions related to sound exposure control required for compliance to\n* EN/IEC 62368-1 3rd edition. Implementing this interface is mandatory for devices for which\n* compliance to this standard is mandated and implementing audio offload decoding or other direct\n* playback paths where volume control happens below the audio HAL.\n*/\n@VintfStability\ninterface ISoundDose {\n/**\n* Max value in dBA used for momentary exposure warnings as defined by IEC62368-1\n* 3rd edition. This value represents the default RS2 upper bound.\n*/\nconst int DEFAULT_MAX_RS2 = 100;\n/** Min value of the RS2 threshold in dBA as defined by IEC62368-1 3rd edition. */\nconst int MIN_RS2 = 80;\n/**\n* Sets the RS2 upper bound used for momentary exposure warnings. Default value is\n* DEFAULT_MAX_RS2 as specified in IEC62368-1 3rd edition.\n*\n* @param rs2ValueDbA custom RS2 upper bound to use\n* @throws EX_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT if rs2ValueDbA is greater than DEFAULT_MAX_RS2 or lower\n* than MIN_RS2\n*/\nvoid setOutputRs2UpperBound(float rs2ValueDbA);\n/**\n* Gets the RS2 upper bound used for momentary exposure warnings.\n*\n* @return the RS2 upper bound in dBA\n*/\nfloat getOutputRs2UpperBound();\n/**\n* Registers the HAL callback for sound dose computation. If sound dose is supported\n* the MEL values and exposure notifications will be received through this callback\n* only. The internal framework MEL computation will be disabled.\n* It is not possible to unregister the callback. The HAL is responsible to provide\n* the MEL values throughout its lifecycle.\n*\n* @param callback to use when new updates are available for sound dose\n*/\nvoid registerSoundDoseCallback(in IHalSoundDoseCallback callback);\n@VintfStability\noneway interface IHalSoundDoseCallback {\n/**\n* Called whenever the current MEL value exceeds the set RS2 upper bound.\n*\n* @param currentDbA the current MEL value which exceeds the RS2 upper bound\n* @param audioDevice the audio device where the MEL exposure warning was recorded\n*/\nvoid onMomentaryExposureWarning(float currentDbA, in AudioDevice audioDevice);\n@VintfStability\nparcelable MelRecord {\n/**\n* Array of continuously recorded MEL values >= MIN_RS2 (1 per second).\n* First value in the array was recorded at 'timestamp'.\n*/\nfloat[] melValues;\n/**\n* Corresponds to the time in seconds, as reported by CLOCK_MONOTONIC, when\n* the first MEL entry in melValues was recorded. The timestamp values have\n* to be consistent throughout all audio ports, equal timestamp values will\n* be aggregated.\n*/\nlong timestamp;\n}\n/**\n* Provides a MelRecord containing continuous MEL values sorted by timestamp.\n* Note that all the MEL values originate from the audio device specified by audioDevice.\n* In case values from multiple devices need to be reported, the caller should execute\n* this callback once for every device.\n*\n* @param melRecord contains the MEL values used for CSD\n* @param audioDevice the audio device where the MEL values were recorded\n*/\nvoid onNewMelValues(in MelRecord melRecord, in AudioDevice audioDevice);\n}\n}\nThe new HAL interface implements callbacks\nthat inform the framework about momentary exposure and provides MEL values\nwhenever the output level exceeds RS1. When these interfaces are implemented,\nthe framework uses them for CSD reporting. Without this callback implementation,\na fallback implementation on AudioFlinger\nis used to calculate estimates of CSD values.\nSound dose standalone AIDL support\nUntil OEMs can integrate sound dose in the AIDL audio HAL, they can use the\nstandalone AIDL API ISoundDoseFactory\nas a workaround. ISoundDoseFactory\nuses the ISoundDose\ninterface, as shown in the\nfollowing code sample:\n@VintfStability\ninterface ISoundDoseFactory {\n/**\n* Retrieve the sound dose interface for a given audio HAL module name.\n*\n* If a device must comply to IEC62368-1 3rd edition audio safety requirements and is\n* implementing audio offload decoding or other direct playback paths where volume control\n* happens below the audio HAL, it must return an instance of the ISoundDose interface.\n* The same instance must be returned during the lifetime of the HAL module.\n* If the HAL module does not support sound dose, null must be returned, without throwing\n* any errors.\n*\n* @param module for which we trigger sound dose updates.\n* @return An instance of the ISoundDose interface implementation.\n* @throws EX_ILLEGAL_STATE If there was an error creating an instance.\n*/\n@nullable ISoundDose getSoundDose(in @utf8InCpp String module);\n}\nSound dose AIDL Audio HAL support\nThe sound dose interface is supported long term as part of the AIDL Audio HAL by\nextending the IModule\ninterface, as shown in the following code sample:\n@VintfStability\ninterface IModule {\n\u2026\n/**\n* Retrieve the sound dose interface.\n*\n* If a device must comply to IEC62368-1 3rd edition audio safety requirements and is\n* implementing audio offload decoding or other direct playback paths where volume control\n* happens below the audio HAL, it must return an instance of the ISoundDose interface.\n* The same instance must be returned during the lifetime of the HAL module.\n* If the HAL module does not support sound dose, null must be returned, without throwing\n* any errors.\n*\n* @return An instance of the ISoundDose interface implementation.\n* @throws EX_ILLEGAL_STATE If there was an error creating an instance.\n*/\n@nullable ISoundDose getSoundDose();\n}\nThis feature is an implementation of a new regulation described in IEC62368-1 3rd edition and EN50332-3, so there are no external-facing APIs.\nOEMs can certify their devices by implementing the new HAL interfaces and providing accurate MEL data for CSD to the audio framework (recommended), or by providing a custom sound dose implementation.\nEnable the calculation of sound dose\nBy default, AOSP supports the hearing safety logic that ensures certification with the existing EN50332-2 and IEC62368-1 10.6.5 standards.\nIn Android 14, calculation of sound dose is disabled by default.\nUse the following guidelines to enable the calculation of sound dose starting with Android 14-QPR1.\nIf the sound dose regulations are enforced in your country, check if\nconfig_safe_media_volume_enabled\ninconfig.xml\nis set totrue\n.To be compliant with EN50332-3 and IEC62368-1 10.6.3, vendors must overlay the\nconfig_safe_sound_dosage_enabled\nflag inconfig.xml\ntotrue\n. For devices that support offload decoding and don't implement the sound dose HAL interfaces,config_safe_sound_dosage_enabled\nmustn't be set totrue\n. In such cases, settingconfig_safe_sound_dosage_enabled\ntotrue\ncan lead to inaccurate CSD values and certification issues for safety hearing standards.\nThe following decision graph describes the logic that determines if, based on the country restrictions and values of flags, either the CSD or the legacy hearing safety levels (implemented prior to Android 14) are calculated.\nFigure 2. Enable the calculation of sound dose (the logic is added in Android 14-QPR1).\nValidation\nWhen implementing the HAL interface for sound dose, OEMs must validate against\nthe VTS test cases defined by VtsHalAudioCoreTargetTest\nfor the IModule AIDL Audio HAL implementation, or by VtsHalSoundDoseFactoryTargetTest\nfor the standalone sound dose AIDL HAL implementation."
