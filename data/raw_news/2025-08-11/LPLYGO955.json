  "title": "I, Robot star hints at drama on Will Smith film over audience reaction",
  "description": "Alan Tudyk, 54, portrayed the role of Sonny in the 2004 film iRobot, in which Smith, 56, starred as Del Spooner.",
  "content": "A former costar of actor Will Smith insinuated that the actor used his clout to minimize his presence in a film more than two decades back - impacting his career in the process.\n\nAlan Tudyk, 54, portrayed the role of Sonny in the 2004 film iRobot, in which Smith, 56, starred as Del Spooner.\n\nTudyk said that he was unceremoniously dumped from promotional materials when his character began testing higher than Smith's with trial audiences.\n\nTudyk, appearing on Toon'd In with Jimmy Cummings, explained the course of events that led to him being minimized in the promotional rollout of the motion picture.\n\n'They were doing test audiences with the movie,' Tudyk said on the June 15 edition of the podcast, which has begun to go viral.\n\nTudyk continued: 'They score the characters and I got word back, \"Alan, you're testing higher than Will Smith.\"'\n\n'And then I was gone - I was gone,' Tudyk said. 'There was no publicity and my name was not mentioned.'\n\nTudyk said he was 'so shocked' and concerned moviegoers weren't 'going to know' he played a key role in the motion picture.\n\nThis is not Smith\u2019s first time publicly clashing with a costar: In 1993 he had a well-publicized feud with his Fresh Prince of Bel-Air castmate Janet Hubert, which ultimately resulted from her dismissal from the show.\n\nHubert did reunite with Smith and the cast during a 2020 reunion that aired on HBO Max.\n\nSmith in the special admitted that he 'wasn't sensitive' and 'wasn't perceptive' to struggles Hubert was dealing with, as she was pregnant at the time of their row.\n\n'Now that I've had three kids I've learned some things that I did not know at the time,' he said, 'and I would do things very differently - but I can see where I made the set very difficult for Janet.'\n\nThe Academy Award-winning King Richard star continues to try and rebuild his reputation more than three years after he slapped Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars.\n\nSmith's infamous slap of Chris Rock came on March 27, 2022, after the comedian made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\nThe joke was about her shaved head, saying, 'Jada, I love you, G.I. Jane 2, can\u2019t wait to see it!' in a reference to the 1997 movie which featured Demi Moore with a shaved head. (Pinkett Smith has diagnosed with alopecia, which causes hair loss.)\n\nSmith then walked onstage and smacked Rock, then returned to his seat and shouted at him twice, 'Keep my wife's name out of your f***ing mouth!' to a stunned audience.\n\nLater in the evening - in his acceptance speech after winning the Best Actor Oscar for his role as tennis patriarch Richard Williams in King Richard - Smith apologized to the Academy and other nominees, but made no reference to Rock.\n\nSmith subsequently apologized on multiple occasions over the incident, and resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ahead of being issued a 10-year ban from the Oscars.\n\nIn an apology he issued in July of 2022 over the incident in an online clip, Smith said his spouse 'had nothing to do with' his attack on Rock.\n\n'I made a choice on my own from my own experiences, from my history with Chris,' he said. 'I want to say sorry to my kids and my family for the heat that I've brought on all of us.'\n\nHe added: 'I've reached out to Chris and the message that came back is that he's not ready to talk, and when he is he will reach out. So I will say to you, Chris, I apologize to you. My behavior was unacceptable, and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk.'",

      "text": "- Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com\nWill Smith was left red-faced on Instagram on Thursday as he addressed a barrage of social media criticism over a hilarious habit viewers spotted in the opening episodes of hit US sitcom The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air.\nIn the last few days, fans of the classic comedy have been bombarding the actor, 56, with negative comments after they noticed his tendency to lip synch his co-stars' words while they were talking while waiting for his next line.\nNow the Men In Black lead has taken to social media to address the saga, branding the archive clips 'terrible' as he engaged in a light-hearted throwback with his Fresh Prince co-star Tatyana Ali, who played Ashley Banks.\nWill said he had never had an acting job before this one and no one told him about his bad habit until episode six. Showing one clip from season one to the actress Will said: 'This is the worst one right here.'\nThe Fresh Prince Of Bel Air is a 90s American sitcom which tells the story of an inner-city teenager from Philadelphia who is sent to live with his wealthy aunt and uncle at their Bel-Air mansion.\nIn the short video, Will's character very clearly mouths his colleague's part of the script before performing his own lines.\nTatyana then screamed with laughter and Will, who made his screen debut in the Fresh Prince, added: 'Ahhhh. That's awful.'\nWill Smith has been ridiculed on social media over one amateurish habit in the hit US sitcom The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air and responded to it on Instagram with co-star Tatyana Ali\nFans have only just noticed that in the series' early days Will used to mouth his co-stars' words while they were talking while waiting for his next line\nShe said: 'You used to know the entire script.'\nWill replied: 'Yes that was the thing I was learning the entire script. In the middle of the scene, Karyn [Parsons] just said, \"stop it!\"\n'I didn't know I was doing that.'\n'You used to do it with me a lot,' Tatyana said.\n'Terrible, terrible, terrible,' Will sighed.\nHis co-star said: 'It was only the first season though. It was only the first season.'\n'There's no reason we were successful,' Will laughed. 'There's no reason we should have been successful.'\nMocking a scene between the two, Tatyana pretended to say a few lines: '\"And yeah, um, cause mum said and dad said.\"'\nThe actor (pictured, second from top right on the show, with Tatyana, bottom left) got his screen breakthrough in 1990 playing a version of himself in the popular NBC show\nHe showed one particularly incriminating clip to Fresh Prince co-star Tatyana, who played Ashley Banks in the comedy\nWill then pretended to mouth her lines before adding: 'It was six episodes before somebody told me. I think Don Cheadle was the sixth episode.\n'I think that was the one that was bad and they were like, \"okay we have to stop\".\n'And they literally had to go and show me what I was doing.

It all has helped him look inside and mature. He is better but still remorseful.\n'Will listened to those who tried to help him and feels that he has become a better person.'\nRemorse: Will Smith is 'still remorseful' over slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars and has tried 'unsuccessfully' to make amends with the comedian, a source told People this week\nResponse: Chris 's long-awaited public response to being slapped by Smith has been met with high praise - with some calling it the 'best brutal takedown' in history\nChris's long-awaited public response to being slapped by Smith has been met with high praise - with some calling it the 'best brutal takedown' in history.\nAn industry source told People that Rock 'is riding high from the Netflix special.'\nThey added: 'He said what he needed to say and doesn't give a s*** about the reaction either way. He isn't worried.\n'People have been waiting for [Rock's] reaction for a year. For the most part, I think it was well received. People don't expect sugarcoating from Chris Rock.'\nDuring his new Netflix standup special which premiered live Saturday night, Rock verbally hit back at Smith a year after the incident that saw Smith banned from the Academy.\nIn a nearly two minute segment, Rock fired off at Smith's decision to slap him on stage at the awards ceremony, making Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith the butt of his joke about her infidelity.\n'Everybody called him a b**ch, and who's he hitting? Me,' Rock joked to a crowd that included a friend of Meghan Markle's who was spotted laughing backstage, according to Page Six.\nThe comedian also took aim at the former 'Suits' actress during his special, saying she was 'acting all dumb' for not realizing the royal family are the 'OGs of racism.'\nRock's rant has since been applauded on social media as 'the perfect/best way' to get back at Smith for the moment that changed both of their careers.\nThe comedian made audience members and live viewers wait until the last ten minutes of 'Chris Rock: Selective Outrage' before he addressed the slap.\n'You all know what happened to me, getting smacked by Suge Smith,' the comedian joked. Rock said: 'It still hurts. I got 'Summertime' ringing in my ears.'\nDigs: Bringing Jada up in the show, he addressed her affair and his frustration that he was the one who 'bore the brunt' of the couple's marital troubles\nBringing Jada up in the show, he addressed her affair and his frustration that he was the one who 'bore the brunt' of the couple's marital troubles.\n'Will Smith practices selective outrage,' Rock said, giving a nod to the special's title.\n'Everybody that really knows knows I had nothing to do with that. I didn't have any entanglements\u2026She hurt him way more than he hurt me.'\nThe slap occurred last year after Rock made a joke about Pinkett-Smith's bald head, caused by alopecia.\nRock had joked that Pinkett-Smith was rocking a 'G.I. Jane' look which caused her husband to storm the stage and slap him, followed by him repeating: 'Keep my wife's name out your f***ing mouth!'\nDuring his new standup special, Rock joked about his struggle in the year since.\n'Anybody that say \"words hurt\" has never been punched in the face,' he said.\n'But I'm not a victim, baby. You'll never see me on Oprah or Gayle crying,' Rock said. He joked that he 'took that s**t like [Manny] Pacquaio.'\nThe crowd in the audience laughed out loud while those at home took to social media to give their thoughts.\n'Like most comedians I'm continuously grateful for the existence of Chris Rock. Thank you comedy gods,' wrote fellow comedian Jim Gaffigan.\n'Listen me when I tell you. THIS IS THE MOST SAVAGE MIC DROP OF ALL TIME. NUF RESPEC,' wrote on Twitter user.\nThat user was referencing the mic drop at the end of his special when he responds to those who have asked why he didn't slap Smith back, saying: 'You know what my parents taught me? Don't fight in front of white people.'\nThis comes after people called out Chris for getting a fact about Will Smith wrong for a joke he made during his Netflix special.\nChris quipped that he felt the slap and brought up some of Will's movie roles to illustrate that one of them was an action star and the other a funny guy.\nHe said: 'I know you can't tell on camera - Will Smith is significantly bigger than me. We are not the same size, okay? Will Smith does movies with his shirt off. You've never seen me do a movie with my shirt off.\nDeliberate? Fans have criticised Chris Rock for 'deliberately' choosing the city of Baltimore - Jada Pinkett Smith's hometown - to shoot his new Netflix special\n'If I'm in a movie getting open heart surgery, I've got on a sweater. Will Smith played Muhammad Ali in a movie.'\nThe comedian went on to compare their roles in cartoons, saying: 'even in animated movies, I'm a zebra, he\u2019s a f**king shark'.\nThis is in reference to the 2004 movie Shark Tale.\nBut Chris' fans pointed out that Will did not play a shark but instead gave his voice to a fish, a bluestreak cleaner wrasse named Oscar to be precise.\nFans also criticised Chris Rock for 'deliberately' choosing the city of Baltimore - Pinkett Smith's hometown - to shoot his new Netflix special.\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Jennifer Lopez has an unexpected guest during her concert"

      "text": "Will Smith and Janet Hubert emotionally end their 27-year feud on Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air reunion... after she tells him: 'You guys went so far, I lost so much'\nWill Smith and Janet Hubert finally hashed out their feud which has been running since her departure from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.\nJanet, 64, played Aunt Viv on the first three seasons of the sitcom but left in 1993, setting off a public war of words with Will and the collapse of her career.\nNow on a new reunion special with HBO Max she and Will, 52, talked emotionally through their past difficulties as she told him: 'I lost everything.'\nTalking it out: On a new HBO Max reunion special, Will Smith and Janet Hubert hashed out their feud which has been running 27 years since her departure from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air\nWill and Janet had a one-on-one conversation in a movie theater setting, separate from the general cast reunion in a recreation of the sitcom's living room set.\n'I just wanted to know one thing: why, why so far? You guys went so far. I lost so much,' she said to Will of their feud. 'How do we heal that?'\nWill suggested that he should 'know your story,' and Janet said: 'You have no idea,' adding that the experience 'was insane' for her.\nWhile filming season three Janet was pregnant with her son Elijah - and on the reunion special she alleged she was in a 'very abusive marriage' at the time.\nThe way they were: Janet, 64, played Aunt Viv on the first three seasons of the sitcom but left in 1993, setting off a public war of words with Will and the collapse of her career\nAt that point Janet was with her first husband James Whitten, whom she ultimately divorced in 1994, the year after she left The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.\nShe said in a confessional that when she was working during her tough pregnancy: 'I was no longer laughing, smiling, joking, because there were things that were going on that nobody knew about. The cast had no idea what was going on.'\n'You know, during that time of her pregnancy I wasn't sensitive. I wasn't perceptive,' Will admitted in his own confessional. 'And you know, now that I've had three kids I've learned some things that I did not know at the time and I would do things very differently, but I can see where I made the set very difficult for Janet.'\nJanet also denied the reports that she was fired, saying she left over a 'really bad deal' that limited the amount of work she could do on the sitcom while also hemming her into a non-compete arrangement.\nTogether again: Will and Janet had a one-on-one conversation in a movie theater setting, separate from the general cast reunion (pictured)\n'So that meant my salary was cut. I had a new baby and a husband who was out of work. So I said no. I did not accept their offer. I was never fired,' she insisted.\nShe told Will that 'when I left the show I had this new baby and no one. Family disowned me. Hollywood disowned me. My family said: \"You've ruined our name.\"'\nJanet added: 'And I wasn't unprofessional on the set. I just stopped talking to everybody because I didn't know who to trust because I'd been banished, and they said it was you who banished me, because you were Will. You were a kid. It was hard.'\n'I was 21 years old, you know. Everything was a threat to me,' said Will slowly, and when Janet asked why she was in that category he said: 'Not you, the world. I was so driven by fear - and jokes and comedy.'\nThrowback: Janet is pictured in a publicity still from the show with (left to right, top to bottom) Joseph Marcell, James Avery, Alfonso Ribeiro, Tatyana Ali and Karyn Parsons\nThe Hollywood heartthrob said that in the intervening years, divorce, remarriage and parenthood have enabled him to 'see now the level and pain and the level of struggle that it was for you just to show up everyday, and then - '\n'But you took all that away from me with your words,' Janet interjected. 'You know, words can kill. I lost everything. Reputation, everything. Everything. And I understand you were able to move forward, but you know those words, calling a black woman \"difficult\" in Hollywood is the kiss of death.'\nShe went on: 'It's the kiss of death, and it's hard enough being a dark-skinned black woman in this business. But I felt it was necessary for us to finally move forward - and I'm sorry that I have blasted you to pieces,' she added with a laugh.\nJanet struggled to hold back her tears as Will thanked her for her side of the story and said: 'When I look back now it's, you know, it's obvious that you were having a hard time and I felt like you hated me.'\nRepose: Joseph, James, Alfonso, Tyler Collins, Kadeem Hardison, Will, Quincy JOnes, Al B. Sure!, Tatyana, Janet and Karyn are pictured during a shoot day on the show in 1990\nShe touched his cheek and he placed a hand on her shoulder while he said: 'I could not do a 30-year celebration of this show and not celebrate you - celebrate your contribution to the show, celebrate your contribution to my life.'\n'I didn't come here to have animosity. I came here to resolve 'cause it's time,' she said in a confessional, calling her conversation with Will 'healing.'\nWill's chat with Janet was taped in September after she posted to her Instagram fan page urging him to discuss their problems with her face to face.\nDearly departed: The reunion had to take place in the absence of James Avery who died of complications from an open heart surgery in 2013 at the age of just 68\n'So September comes after August it's the 30th anniversary a Fresh Prince. And they want to start a war. Well here is my challenge - we can either keep this war going for another 30 years but I'm not going to, or you can sit down with me and talk to me and not about me Mr. Smith then let's do it,' wrote Janet.\n'Can you only sit and talk about your strange unsavory problems in front of the world?' she said, apparently having a dig at Will's recent Red Table Talk with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith about her affair with R&B singer August Alsina.\n'Accept my challenge or shut up! Either you're telling the truth and the BLACK MEN of the cast are telling the truth or I'm telling the truth. And only YOU and I... and quite a few others, know the truth let's do this do YOU have the courage? #seeyouinseptember,' Janet concluded\n'Well here is my challenge': Will's chat with Janet was taped in September after she posted to her Instagram fan page urging him to discuss their problems with her face to face\nWill apparently accepted her challenge as the pair sat down for the reunion taping this September 9, 30 years to the day since the show premiered.\nJanet had publicly held Will responsible for her exit from the show, calling him an 'egomaniac' during a 2011 interview where she said a reunion was off the table.\n'There will never be a reunion...as I will never do anything with an a**hole like Will Smith,' she declared to TMZ, adding that 'This constant reunion thing will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn't know the word.'\nFive years later she said on YouTube that while on the show she approached Will to help her and their co-stars negotiate a wage hike 'like they did on Friends.'\n'Janet Hubert was never difficult on that set': Four years ago Janet appeared on The Real and discussed the aftermath of her departure from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air\nShe claimed that Will rebuffed her efforts, alleging that he told her: 'My deal is my deal and y'all's deal is y'all's deal.'\n'I can say straight up that Janet Hubert wanted the show to be The Aunt Viv Of Bel-Air Show because I know she is going to dog me in the press,' Will said on the radio in Atlanta the year she left the series.\n'She has basically gone from a quarter of a million dollars a year to nothing. She\u2019s mad now but she\u2019s been mad all along,' he added.\n'She said once: \"I\u2019ve been in the business for 10 years and this snotty-nosed punk comes along and gets a show.\" No matter what, to her I\u2019m just the AntiChrist.'\n'A**hole': Janet has in the past held Will responsible for her departure from the show, calling him an 'egomaniac' during a 2011 interview where she said a reunion was off the table\nFour years ago Janet appeared on The Real and discussed the aftermath of her departure from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.\n'Janet Hubert was never difficult on that set. Janet Hubert was so professional it wasn\u2019t even funny. I think Will simply needed to win and I think sometimes when you get caught up in a lie \u2013 and those things never happened,' Janet insisted.\n'She never left the set. I never left the set. We got along great. I think he was young and he was inexperienced and I think he simply had to win.'\nReferring to Will's then-manager James Lassiter she said: 'I spoke to JL when my dad died and my brother died and I begged them, I said: \"I have a family. I need you to tell the world that this stuff didn\u2019t happen.\" And I was waiting in my heart thinking: \"Somebody will come to me one day and help me,\" but they didn\u2019t.'\nYou can watch The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Reunion on HBO or on Stan in Australia.\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Jennifer Lopez has an unexpected guest during her concert"

      "text": "Is Will Smith 'uncancelling' himself? Actor has been on a mission to rebuild his career with viral videos and a return to his Fresh Prince roots - three years after THAT Oscars slap\n- Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com\nThe 2022 Academy Awards should've been a career high for Will Smith, with the star winning his first Best Actor Oscar in his illustrious three-decade career.\nYet the evening was overshadowed by him jumping on the stage and slapping comedian Chris Rock in the face - with many questioning if the stunt would stop him from ever working again.\nIndeed, it seems his life and career has been on a downward spiral since the incident.\nHis reported \u00a328 million role in slavery epic Emancipation failed to make an impact at the box office in 2022, leaving his movie career somewhat in the wilderness.\nMore recently, Will garnered attention for an 'inappropriate' flirty display and an apparent kiss with India Martinez, 39, as they performed the song First Love at the Premio Lo Nuestro award show in Miami last month.\nYet despite the setbacks, Will has unveiled a number of new projects of late - seemingly throwing himself back into the spotlight and attempting to make his Hollywood comeback.\nSo is Will Smith officially 'uncancelling' himself? MailOnline spoke to a brand expert to uncover the evidence.\nAnnouncing a UK and European tour and a new album\nIs Will Smith 'uncancelling' himself? The actor has been on a mission to rebuild his career with viral videos and a return to his Fresh Prince roots - three years after THAT Oscars slap\nOn Tuesday, Will announced his Based on a True Story summer tour, which is his 'first ever' headline tour andwill see the actor visit a host of venues up and down the UK\nOn Tuesday, Will announced his Based on a True Story summer tour, which is his 'first ever' headline tour andwill see the actor visit a host of venues up and down the UK.\nIt coincides with an album of the same name which is set to be released later this month and will be his first in two decades.\nThese live shows will see him performing songs from the new album along with his classic hits including Jiggy Wit It, Miami, Summertime and more.\nThe 14-track album will feature a variety of collaborators including DJ Jazzy Jeff, Teyana Talor, and Jac Ross.\nAnd its cover shows Will paying tribute to his Fresh Prince character with a Philadelphia Varsity jacket and baseball cap as he poses in front of a white backdrop with his hand tipping his cap.\nBut, some fans are shocked to discover that most of the UK venues have a capacity of less than 5,000, which seems small compared to the actor's huge level of fame.\nThe locations include the likes of Scarborough and Wolverhampton, but skip out bigger cities like Birmingham, Glasgow and Dublin.\nAhead of his solo tour, he is set to perform at multiple international festivals, including Mawazine in Morocco, POSITIV Festival in France, Dreambeach in Spain and BIG ART Festival in Italy.\nAnnouncing the news of his album earlier this week, Will, whose last studio album Lost and Found was released in 2005, wrote in Instagram: I'M GOING ON TOUR THIS SUMMER!!\n'We're hitting up UK & Europe to bring U all the hits, some new joints, and a few surprises ;-) All these years, I've NEVER done a headline tour and I can't wait to see you guys!!'\nBrand and culture expert Nick Ede said: 'I think the best way to make a comeback is to connect with fans'\nHe gained recognition in American hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince who released Grammy-winning single Parents Just Don't Understand (pictured in 1989)\nFans rushed to the comments to quip: 'Life is complete!!!! Been a fan since the fresh prince days !!!!!!! Omg' and 'I'm excited, I can't wait'.\nBrand and culture expert Nick Ede said: 'I think the best way to make a comeback is to connect with fans.\n'By going on tour he's not alienating himself he's coming to them. This makes him more likeable and more accessible too.\n'Having a movie star like Will smith perform in Manchester, Wolverhampton and Brixton academy, smaller more intimate venues, allows him to get up close and personal.'\nHe added: He will most likely visit local restaurants and sight see wherever he goes to give locals bragging righst that they say a Hollywood icon in their home town.\n'For many stars who have lost it, going back to basics and giving loyal fans what they want is very appealing.\n'Stars like Christina Aguilera whose appeal diminished a few years ago went on tour playing just their hits and in doing so proved their talent and played into the goodwill and nostalgia about them.\n'Now she's back on top commanding millions in vegas and producing West End shows.'\nHe concluded: 'I'm sure will will be doing the chat show circuits making self deprecating remarks about his past, leaving his ego at the door and letting his personality shine through.\n'He may also do some charity work in the places he visits on his tour. His appeal to multi generations means that his star power can be a major force for good and I think he will lean into this too in his bid to regain his Hollywood crown.'\nTaking part in a viral TikTok trend\nIt's been a busy month for Will, who went viral earlier this month as he recreated his iconic Fresh Prince of Bel-Air dance with former co-star Tatyana Ali and a surprise appearance from singer Doechii\nThe duo brought back their silly ditty for a whole new generation in video posted to social media on Friday, which was set to the trending song Anxiety by Doechii, 26\nIt's been a busy month for Will, who went viral earlier this month as he recreated his iconic Fresh Prince of Bel-Air dance with former co-star Tatyana Ali and a surprise appearance from singer Doechii.\nThe duo brought back their silly ditty for a whole new generation in video posted to social media on Friday, which was set to the trending song Anxiety by Doechii, 26.\nThe original dance saw Ashley Banks (Tatyana) busting a move in her room with her headphones on, but oblivious to the fact Smith had just entered.\nWill attempts to gain her attention, but when his efforts fail, he proceeds to mimic her dance moves before she becomes aware of his presence.\nIn this latest video, soundtracked to Anxiety, Tatyana, 46, is once again wearing headphones as she dances in a living room before Smith, 56, enters.\nWill proceeds to copy her dance moves, before Doechii appears and joins in on the fun.\n'Waited 35 years for this dance to trend,' Will captioned the post.\nRevealing he wants to wants to 'rebuild something beautiful' after THAT Oscars slap\nWill famously made headlines when he slapped Chris Rock during the 94th Oscars in March 2022\nWill famously made headlines when he slapped Chris Rock during the 94th Oscars in March 2022.\nThe incident occurred following a joke Chris made about Will's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith's bald head, amid her battle with alopecia,\nIt prompted Will to make his way to the stage, slap Chris and say 'keep my wife's name out of your f****** mouth.'\nLater on he picked up the Oscar for Best Actor for King Richard, bursting into tears onstage but failing to apologise to the comedian.\nWill was then was banned from the Oscars until 2032 and has kept a relatively low profile since.\nHowever, in a recent interview with Genius, Will admitted he wants to 'rebuild something beautiful and powerful' after the Oscars incident.\nHe compared the moment to kintsugi, which is the Japanese art of piecing smashed pottery back together.\nWill told the publication: 'I can look at [the Oscars incident] as an absolute mess, horrible, terrible \u2013 or I can look at it as a really great kintsugi opportunity, to rebuild something beautiful and powerful.\nTalking about one of his new songs, Beautiful Scars, he added: 'I hate admitting that I'm only human \u2013 my ego wants to be Superman \u2026 The word I was thinking about when I thought about the last couple of years of my life was 'brutaful' \u2013 brutal and beautiful.'\nHowever, in a recent interview with Genius , Will admitted he wants to 'rebuild something beautiful and powerful' after the incident\nHe also seems to get candid about it in the lyrcis, as he raps: 'I hate when I lose it, but I face the music / 'Oh, why did he do it?' See, I'm only human'.\nBrand expert Nick believes that Will is 'plugging into nostalgia ' to slowly rebuild his profile/\nHe added: 'Will Smith is one of the most famous people on the planet and although to many he is most famous for his Oscar slap or his fashion forward children, he has slowly been building his reputation that is seeing him being uncancelled.\n'Like many Hollywood stars who have fallen from grace he has been building his reputation in other territories namely Europe, Asia and the UAE.\n'With the announcement of his tour and a new album the first in 20 years hes slowly building his profile, playing to his loyal fan base and plugging into the good will and nostalgia that people have for him.\n'With his TikTok FreshPprince reunion going viral and the Bad Boys sequel making over 300 million more dollars than it cost it seems like the past is well and truly behind him.'\nHe continued: 'He's playing on his reputation as a Hollywood icon in countries where he knows hell get a big reception.\n'It feels right that someone who has been such a huge star should be getting it back \u2013 like Robert Downey jr and Eddie Murphy there are many Hollywood icons who have lost their star power only to regain it in a spectacular way and I think that Will Smith is one of those stars who will never fade and always shine bright.'\nReturning to the red carpet and awards shows\nWill returned to the Grammys this year, marking his first red carpet appearance since the Oscars drama in 2022\nAnd he did more than just attend - Will made his awards show return when he hit the Grammys stage for a special Quincy Jones tribute (pictured with children Willow and Jaden)\nWill returned to the Grammys this year, marking his first red carpet appearance since the Oscars drama in 2022.\nHe looked to be in high spirits as he stepped out in a black Balmain suit with silver and diamond-encrusted embellishments on his coat.\nWill wore matching black pants and black shoes to complete his look at the event, but was not joined by his wife Jada.\nAnd he did more than just attend - Will made his awards show return when he hit the Grammys stage for a special Quincy Jones tribute.\n'You probably wouldn't even know who Will Smith was if it wasn't for Quincy Jones,' he said.\nHe went on to talk about how Quincy 'changed his life,' pointing out that Quincy produced his show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\nBeing supported by celeb pals and his wife Jada\nAs he orchestrates his comeback, Will has a slew of celebrity pals who are backing him all the way (Alfonso Ribeiro pictured left on The Fresh Prince of Bel Air with Will pictured right)\nDespite a rocky marriage including infedilty, Will's wife Jada and his family have stood by him publicly supporting him\nAs he orchestrates his comeback, Will has a slew of celebrity pals who are backing him all the way.\nIn a recent interview on The Jennifer Hudson Show, his Fresh Prince co-star Alfonso Ribeiro said: 'Will is my brother for life He's absolutely the best.'\nThe actor gushed that 'their friendship and bond has withstood the time of four or five decades.'\nHe told Jennifer: 'It's wonderful to hear Will give me some of my flowers. Obviously, I give him flowers all the time. He is just so incredible. He's the most talented guy I know and the most dedicated guy I know. It's mutual love.'\nDespite a rocky marriage including infidelity, Will's wife Jada and his family have stood by him publicly supporting him.\nIn 2020, Jada admitted to carrying on a multi-year affair with the musician Alsina during a period when she and Will were separated.\nHe later admitted to his own extramarital affairs, and in late 2023, Jada clarified that the two had been separated going all the way back to 2016, though she said they don't have any plans to divorce.\nSpeaking to Red magazine about the Oscars incident, she said: 'I was just really concerned about Will. And I realised in that moment that, as challenging as our relationship can be, I'm always going to be by his side, no matter what.'\nWhile speaking to Daily Mail's YOU Magazine, Jade said 'many positive things came after' Will slapped Chris.\n'After all those years trying to figure out if I would leave Will's side, it took that slap for me to see I will never leave him. Who knows where our relationship would be if that hadn't happened?'\nTeasing a sequel to one of his biggest movie hits\nWill revealed that an idea was in the works for a sequel to his hit 2008 superhero film Hancock. He said he has a part in mind for Zendaya\n'There's a really cool, really cool Hancock 2 idea,' he announced. 'We haven't even talked about it so I'm gonna give you one little piece \u2014 Zendaya will be being being approached for a role in Hancock 2'\nDuring an appearance last month on Twitch with Canadian gamer xQc (real name: F\u00e9lix Lengyel), Will revealed that an idea was in the works for a sequel to his hit 2008 superhero film Hancock.\n'They've been leaking all my information,' he joked after the hosts pointed out that a commenter had mentioned a Hancock sequel.\n'There's a really cool, really cool Hancock 2 idea,' he announced. 'We haven't even talked about it so I'm gonna give you one little piece \u2014 Zendaya will be being being approached for a role in Hancock 2.'\nHancock's original studio, Sony Pictures, had no comment on Will's plans for a sequel, according to Variety.\nThe original film was a box office hit in 2008 despite being savaged by critics.\nIt managed to gross an impressive $629.4 million against a $150 million budget, according to Box Office Mojo, which made it the fourth highest-grossing film of the year, as well as one of Will's most-successful movies.\nHe starred in the title role of a seemingly immortal man with Superman-like abilities who has fallen on hard times and descended into alcoholism."

Tudyk expressed his shock at being excluded from publicity, fearing that audiences wouldn't recognize his contribution to the film. This incident adds to the narrative of Smith's complex relationships with co-stars, including a previous feud with Janet Hubert from 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air', which was addressed in a recent reunion special.",
