  "content": "Fourteen boxes of wildly popular Labubu dolls worth a staggering $30,000 were recovered by California police after they were stolen from a warehouse last week, authorities said.\n\nThe pilfered plushies were found at a home in Chino, the city\u2019s police department announced on Monday.\n\nPolice said evidence showed the suspect or suspects were planning to resell the collectables across the country.\n\nThe dolls were returned to their rightful owners, cops said.\n\nLast week, a store in La Puente, Calif. had $30,000 of its own horde of Labubu dolls snatched by a group of thieves who passed right by cash and even electronics in favor of the demonic collectibles.\n\nThe shop had its merchandise safely returned by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department last Friday, according to its Instagram.\n\nLabubus, a sharp-toothed cross between a Cabbage Patch Kid and an Angel Baby typically complete with bunny ears and a dead-eyed stare, shot up popularity over the summer.\n\nPrices were driven through the roof, with a single \u201cblind box\u201d grab retailing for $27.99 and a six-pack for $167.94.\n\nSome of the supposed rarest Labubu dolls can sell online for upwards of $500.\n\nOne skateboarding Labubu part of the 2023 line sold for a jaw-dropping $10,500 last week.\n\nEven massive celebrities flocked to the booming collectible, including Rihanna and K-pop girl group Blackpink\u2019s dancer Lisa who were both seen with Labubu dolls on their handbags.\n\nMore than 300 different Labubu dolls have been released since its launch in 2015.\n\nOthers trying to capitalize on its popularity released a fake, dubbed a Lafufu, that some stores and arcades have opted to feature for the more reasonable prices.",

      "text": "New Yorkers struck with Labubu lunacy as obvious fakes of uber-popular Chinese monster dolls flood Canal Street\nThe Labubu lunacy has taken over Canal Street.\nKnockoffs of the viral, little monster dolls have flooded the infamous Chinatown market \u2014 with New Yorkers eagerly snatching them up despite the celeb-favorite bag charms being obvious fakes.\nDozens of tourist trap shops have counterfeit versions of the creepy, pint-sized toys \u2014 dubbed \u201cLafufus\u201d \u2014 proudly displayed at their entrances for as low as $10, an enticing discount off Chinese retailer POP Mart\u2019s $30 pricetag.\n\u201cIt\u2019s trendy and I thought it was cute,\u201d said Griselda Flores, 24, who bought a $20 knockoff from a corner market for her 4-year-old son.\nHe wouldn\u2019t know the difference, Flores said \u2014 while she had a real, pink little monster dangling from her purse.\n\u201cHe saw it and wanted it,\u201d Flores said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to spend too much.\u201d\nIt took an hour for her to secure two legit Labubus from an online POP Mart auction, which ultimately cost her $76, she noted.\nThe 3-inch monsters, created by Hong Kong-based artist Kasing Lung, began being sold on POP Mart in 2019, but only became a global sensation recently after being trotted around by the likes of singer Lisa from the group Blackpink, Rihanna and Dua Lipa.\nOriginal Labubus can come fairly cheap via the \u201cblind box\u201d craze, in which US buyers can pay $27.99 for a mystery figurine \u2014 and the chance to receive a rare version of the toy has only served to fuel the online frenzy.\nThe high demand means the secret boxes sometimes sell out in minutes, and the uber-popular plushies can skyrocket in resale value when they\u2019re unboxed.\nSome resellers have been pocketing up to $5,000 per Labubu on secondhand retail sites like eBay.\nThe Labubu trade is so hot that it\u2019s even bled into the black markets, with Page Six\u2019s own Evan Real and Danny Murphy spending a collective $745 on the creepy little dolls.\nThe \u201cVirtual Realitea\u201d stars stumbled upon a \u201cGen Z plug\u201d who deals the authentic, but extremely marked up prices, which they are willing to pay in order to choose the color and style of their dolls, as well as get it in their hands within a day.\n\u201cWhen you see them in the wild, when you see someone with, it you get hooked into it,\u201d said Murphy, who has seven Labubus. \u201cI fell for the rush and I love the fact that I was able to go to the opposite of an outlet mall for it.\u201d\nReal, who suffered through the auction-like process of buying off POP Mart\u2019s website twice, now has six Labubus, \u201cand I feel six times more joy in my life every day when I look at them sitting on my desk,\u201d he said.\nBut he said he needs to draw the line before buying more: \u201cThe addiction has gotten out of hand.\u201d\nFor shoppers in search of cheaper wares, many Canal Street vendors sell the dolls unboxed \u2014 alongside bogus Louis Vuitton bags and Prada sunglasses \u2014 for the low price of a single Alexander Hamilton, with their flaws and inconsistencies on full display.\nThe Post bought a \u201cHave a Seat\u201d Labubu on Wednesday and the toy\u2019s head was barely hanging on, had 10 teeth, loose threads, melted paint and a plastic Labubu-shaped design on its foot.\n\u201cThat one\u2019s bad,\u201d said Xander Goodman, 18, of Austin, Texas, who was wearing one of the two real Labubus in his collection.\nThe teen bought the toys mostly because of their popularity, but felt confident in knowing that he had possession of something that would eventually \u201cappreciate in value.\u201d\n\u201cA way to spot a fake Labubu is you look at the teeth: you usually have nine teeth [on a real one]. The ears can also be misshapen and not the right colors, and the toes can kind of be really wide and have different amounts,\u201d he said.\nThe best way to tell if a Labubu is real is through the \u201ccaring card\u201d that the toy comes with inside its box, Goodman noted.\n\u201cThere is a little QR code. You are able to scan that and it can verify the authenticity of it.\u201d\nNone of the Canal Street Labubus came with such a card, but customers didn\u2019t seem to care.\nOne salesperson told The Post all the stores buy the Labubus from the same supplier, while a second said they come straight from China.\nAll the salespeople were adamant that the toys were authentic \u2014 and not Lafufus.\nNolan Petras, 7, of Georgia picked out an unboxed monster doll because he could \u201cactually see what it is.\u201d\n\u201cI know if they have 9 teeth it\u2019s a real one,\u201d he said, pointing to the rainbow version he chose having the correct number of chompers.\n\u201cThese girls at my school come over to my house to play and they have it, the fake kind off Temu,\u201d Nolan said, pointing out his classmates\u2019 \u201cLabubus\u201d were obviously fake because they had 10 teeth."

      "text": "Austin Target shooting suspect claimed he was Jesus, chose his victims \u2014 an employee, grandfather and 4-year-old granddaughter \u2014 at random\nThe disturbed fiend who allegedly opened fire in a Target parking lot in Texas claimed to be Jesus and gunned down his three victims \u2014 identified Tuesday as a cart collector, a grandfather and his 4-year-old granddaughter \u2014 at random.\nEthan Nieneker, 32, went on the deadly rampage Monday afternoon in Austin, using a family member\u2019s handgun to fatally shoot Target employee Hector Leopoldo Martinez Machuca, 24, Adam Chow, 66, and Chow\u2019s young granddaughter, the Austin Police Department announced Tuesday.\n\u201cHe said that he was Jesus and there was no real reason whatsoever given,\u201d Austin Homicide detective Nathan Sexton said of the accused mentally ill gunman\u2019s violent spree.\n\u201cIt was a completely random choosing of the victims.\u201d\nPolice said the fatal mayhem began around 2:15 p.m. Monday when Nieneker \u2013 who has a long rap sheet with the department \u2013 stormed the retail lot just north of Austin wearing a Hawaiian shirt and randomly targeted Machuca as the employee was collecting shopping carts.\nThe rabid assailant then fired at a Jeep trying to escape the gunfire before approaching a gray Toyota 4-Runner, where he fatally shot Chow, who was in the driver\u2019s seat, and Chow\u2019s granddaughter in the backseat.\nThe family members were both pronounced dead at the scene, police said.\nChow\u2019s granddaughter, identified by family as Astrid, was remembered as a lively, happy and goofy child.\n\u201cShe loved singing, dancing, and making us laugh,\u201d the family said in a statement to ABC News. \u201cWe are broken and miss them both so much.\u201d\nThe Target employee was taken to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.\nChow\u2019s wife was also injured in the heinous attack before Nieneker stole their car and fled at high speed from the store.\nNieneker later crashed the Toyota into a Volkswagen before coming to a rest on top of an Infiniti SUV. He then assaulted the Volkswagen\u2019s female driver, hijacked the vehicle, and drove off, according to police.\nHe was eventually taken down with a Taser about 20 miles away in the city\u2019 south end after throwing a brick through the home of a friend of his from Bible study and wandering naked through a backyard, all of which was captured on video surveillance.\nPolice are currently investigating how he obtained the firearm \u2013 recovered in the Toyota \u2013 from a family member and whether he was under the influence during the fatal shooting.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking into the drug portion of it,\u201d Sexton said, noting that the maniac called himself \u201cJesus\u201d and provided no motive behind the heartless shooting.\n\u201cHe could have been under the influence of narcotics, it might not necessarily be all attributed to mental illness, so we\u2019re still investigating all of that.\u201d\nThe violent perp\u2019s identity was released Tuesday, along with his bruised and bloodied mugshot, showing blood seeping from a gash near his eye and several scratches across his face.\nAustin Police Chief Lisa Davis said Nieneker has a lengthy history with the department, including previous arrests for assault, drug possession, driving while intoxicated, and two mental health calls.\nShe said Tuesday\u2019s \u201cheartbreaking\u201d tragedy is a failure of the mental health system.\n\u201cAs far as the victims he chose, those were random, but this man had some serious issues,\u201d Davis said, adding that Nieneker worked at a restaurant and lived alone.\n\u201cI think about the systems that failed in a way as we move forward,\u201d she said. We have someone with some serious mental health issues and where are we able to take them and what help are they getting? Where does someone with this capacity to do this get a weapon and when does a family member feel comfortable giving someone with these issues a weapon?\u201d\nThe raging suspect was charged with two counts of capital murder, first-degree felony murder, along with a slew of other charges, including assault.\nHe is being held at the Travis County Jail.\nPolice are urging anyone with information to come forward and contact the department at (512) 974-8477."

      "text": "NYC designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s tragic death on Montauk boat eyed as suspected accidental drug overdose: sources\nThe mysterious death of Manhattan swimwear designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra at the upscale Montauk Yacht Club is being eyed as a possible accidental overdose, sources said Tuesday.\nThe 33-year-old Irish beauty was found unconscious at the ritzy club at around midnight on Aug. 5 aboard a boat named \u201cRipple\u201d \u2013 one of at least two Grateful Dead-themed crafts owned by insurance mogul Christopher Durnan, sources tell The Post.\nAn autopsy is pending to determine Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s official cause of death \u2013 although sources said it was a suspected drug overdose.\nQuestions have been swirling since the tragic night when Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was discovered on the \u201cRipple,\u201d which was docked at the Yacht Club. Members reported hearing screams and called 911, before trying to resuscitate the young designer \u2013 who was later pronounced dead.\nThe good Samaritans told The Post they were woken by a naked man throwing sunscreen at their boat and saw him running down the dock screaming, \u201cDo something!\u201d\nDurnan, 60, a familiar figure at the club, owns the Durnan Group in Rockville Center, which manages the \u201clargest, most successful Workers Compensation Safety Group for Real Estate\u201d on the company\u2019s website.\nHe owns \u201cRipple\u201d and a second boat, \u201cHell in a Bucket,\u201d which was docked alongside and is also a shout-out to the Grateful Dead, several club members confirmed.\nDurnan did not return several requests for comment.\nSuffolk County cops have not filed charges or identified any suspects in the case. But authorities have also not publicly ruled out foul play, despite revealing that there was no evidence of violence to the body.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death is also being investigated by Suffolk County\u2019s East End Drug Task Force, according to a Tuesday report by Newsday.\n\u201cUntil you start ruling stuff out, everything is in play,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told the outlet.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra, a native of the tiny Irish town of Carlow, migrated to the US, where she started as a bottle service girl in SoHo before co-founding East x East, a swimwear label.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Irish Independent last year.\nHer partner in the East x East, Dylan Grace, posted a moving tribute on Instagram following her death.\n\u201cWe dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra summered in the Hamptons, where she hosted successful pop-up shows and fashion exhibits for wealthy clientele in Montauk and the surrounding area.\nShe had finalized her divorce to ex-Sam Ryan just months before her death, according to court records reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cI represented Mr. Ryan in a matrimonial proceeding. The final papers had been submitted to the court, and before the Judgment of Divorce was issued, I became aware of Ms. Nolan-O\u2019slatarra\u2019s passing and promptly notified the court,\u201d his attorney, David Centeno, said in a statement. \u201cOut of respect for the privacy of those involved and my ethical restraints, I cannot discuss whether there was a prenuptial agreement, mediation, or other private arrangements.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s heartbroken mother, Elma Nolan, told the Irish Independent on Aug. 7 that her daughter was planning a trip home to Carlow before her death.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my daughter,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI feel numb and in shock.\u201d\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Brandon Cruz, Joe Marino and Peter Senzamici"

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger whines about being kept up at night by \u2018relentless\u2019 inmate taunts at maximum security lockup: report\nConvicted killer Bryan Kohberger has whined that he\u2019s \u201cextremely annoyed\u201d and losing sleep at the maximum security prison he now calls home \u2014 thanks to fellow inmates who constantly yell through vents into his cell in a \u201crelentless\u201d taunting campaign, according to a report.\nKohberger, who was hit with four life sentences last month for slaying four University of Idaho students, was transferred from jail to the only maximum security prison in the state and is now being held there in solitary confinement.\nAnd the prisoners at Kohberger\u2019s new digs at Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Kuna have had it out for the convicted criminology student \u2014 taking turns shouting into the vent that leads into his cell most hours of the day, a law enforcement source told the Daily Mail.\nKohberger, 28, has made multiple complaints to prison guards that he\u2019s been unable to sleep, according to Chris McDonough, a retired homicide detective who works for the Cold Case Foundation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s driving him crazy,\u201d McDonough told the outlet. \u201cThe inmates are tormenting him at night and almost all hours of the day \u2014 taunting him through the vents in his cell.\u201d\n\u201cThey are literally getting up into the grate and yelling at him. The inmates are taking turns doing it. It\u2019s relentless,\u201d McDonough continued. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely annoyed and frustrated. He\u2019s complaining to the authorities that he can\u2019t sleep because of them.\u201d\nKohberger is being housed in the prison\u2019s restricted unit in the facility\u2019s J block, away from the general prison population.\nHe\u2019s kept in a cell by himself at all times, except for one-hour a day when he\u2019s let into \u201cthe cage\u201d outside for recreation, while he wears restraints. And he\u2019s only allotted one shower every other day.\nThe high-profile nature of Kohberger\u2019s case and the fact he copped to such abhorrent crimes makes him a target for other inmates who would want to harm him \u201cjust to make a name for themselves,\u201d McDonough explained.\nAnd since the other inmates don\u2019t pose a physical threat to Kohberger while he\u2019s in solitary, prison staff aren\u2019t likely to intervene, the former cop said.\nStill, as attention moves away from Kohberger over time, prison staff may eventually be willing to move him back to the general population, McDonough explained.\nAt the jail that Kohberger was previously kept in while he awaited trial, other defendants said he did unusual things like spending hours on the phone with his mom MaryAnn, washing his hands compulsively, taking showers upwards of an hour long and staying awake at night only to nap during the day.\nOnce, he confronted another defendant who yelled \u201cyou suck\u201d at a sports player on the TV because he thought the man was insulting Kohberger and his mom as they spoke on the phone.\nLast month, Kohberger took a surprise plea deal just weeks before his highly anticipated trial was set to kick off. The deal saw him skirt the possibility of facing the death penalty, enraging some of the families of his victims and leaving loved ones with no explanation for why he committed the heinous murders.\nHe admitted to killing Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022 in their off-campus house in Moscow."

      "text": "The most expensive Labubu in the world just sold on eBay \u2014 going for 125 times its original price\nThey aren\u2019t playing around.\nA rare Labubu sold last week for a record-breaking $10,500 on eBay, making it the most expensive of the viral ugly-cute toys on the platform.\nThe grey-brownish doll is rocking Vans streetwear \u2014 including sneakers designed by the popular skater brand, a Vans sweatshirt and a blue and orange hat reading \u201cThe Monsters\u201d \u2014 the series of Labubu characters it belongs to.\nThis little skater monster initially came out back in 2023 as one of Pop Mart\u2019s wildly popular blind boxes, as a collaboration between the shoe brand and Labubu.\nIts original retail price was $85, meaning its resale value was 125 times more.\nLabubu has become a hot commodity on secondary markets, and experts have told Forbes they can make legitimate investments, driven by Pop Mart\u2019s limited supply model.\n\u201cTheir unique look and general appeal will make them a strong market collectible for years to come,\u201d predicted Lori Verderame, a collectible appraiser with her own show on the History Channel.\nAlex Fung, pop culture consignment director at Goldin Auctions, said he thinks the early Labubus are the ones that will best hold their value.\nPop Mart typically sells Labubus for $20 to $40 in \u201cblind boxes\u201d \u2014 meaning buyers doesn\u2019t know which one they\u2019ll get until they open it.\nBut it\u2019s the so-called \u201csecret\u201d Labubus \u2014 the limited editions with odds of getting one in a blind box as slim as 1 in 72 or even 1 in 144 \u2014 that are flipping for thousands on resale sites.\nAnother example is the pink \u201csecret\u201d edition of the \u201cCatch me if you like me\u201d doll, released in limited numbers in early 2024, which recently sold for $2,000 on eBay.\nLabubus sell out instantly during their weekly drops \u2014 with in-person restocking at their stores at 10 a.m. Friday, and online at 9 p.m. Thursday.\nPeople have lined up before dawn, describing release day as \u201cLabubu Hunger Games\u201d in the UK, with Labubus sometimes pulled from stores over chaos and fighting.\nThe creepy, toothy creatures were first designed a decade ago by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, who said they were inspired by Nordic mythology and supernatural folklore.\nHe licensed his designs to Chinese company Pop Mart in 2019, who turned them into collectible plush toys. Its CEO, 38-year-old Wang Ning, saw his fortune jump from $2 billion last year to $22 billion amidst the craze, according to Forbes."
