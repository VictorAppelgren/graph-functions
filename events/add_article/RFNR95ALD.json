      "summary": "Edmundo Martinez grew up in the South Bronx during the 1980s, where he played near the Bronx River, a waterway that had suffered from severe pollution and neglect due to industrialization and urban decline. Once described as an 'open sewer,' the river and its surroundings have undergone significant environmental remediation, transforming into a more pleasant area. The land, previously owned by William Waldorf Astor, became public property, but during Martinez's childhood, it was a neglected park that posed safety concerns for children.",
