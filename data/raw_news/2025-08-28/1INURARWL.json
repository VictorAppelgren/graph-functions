      "text": "Alan Masarek, President & CEO of Avaya, has announced that he will retire at the end of the calendar year.\nHe will relinquish the CEO role even sooner, with Patrick Dennis set to take the mantle from September 1.\nMasarek \u2013 who also enjoyed a successful stint as Vonage CEO \u2013 joined Avaya in July 2022 and has presided over a significant restructuring of the company.\nYet, after a tumultuous couple of years \u2013 which included a bankruptcy \u2013 Masarek believes the Avaya ship is pointing in the right direction. Now, it\u2019s full steam ahead for Dennis & co.\nThat will likely involve driving further engagement from Avaya\u2019s existing enterprise base \u2013 which includes approximately 90 of the Fortune 100 \u2013 with its \u201cinnovation without disruption\u201d vision.\nIndeed, that aligns with Dennis\u2019s experience in both on-premise contact centers and CCaaS as the former CEO of Aspect Software (now Alvaria).\nSince then, he has held the CEO spot at Venafi and ExtraHop, which are prominent names in the cybersecurity space.\nGiven the rising threat from fraudsters, such experiences will allow him to bring some much-needed security nouse into the communication space.\nMoreover, Dennis became Chairman of the Avaya Board in April 2023, shortly after the company emerged from bankruptcy. In that role, he has embraced Masarek\u2019s vision.\nNow, he\u2019s confident that Avaya will achieve \u201clong-term\u201d success. \u201cI am honored and thrilled to lead Avaya on the next phase of its journey, building on the solid foundation laid by Alan and the leadership team,\u201d he said.\nAvaya is now operating from a position of financial strength and industry leadership, and our strategy is resonating with customers around the world who can be confident in Avaya\u2019s consistency in strategic direction and commitment to deliver for their long-term success.\n\u201cI look forward to working with the team to accelerate Avaya\u2019s market momentum.\u201d\nSuch momentum seemed almost unthinkable when Masarek stepped into the role.\nIndeed, the outgoing CEO took over Avaya shortly after it announced a 20+ percent year-over-year (YoY) revenue slump and found itself spiraling into a second bankruptcy in five years.\nAdd to that an ugly lawsuit against former CEO Jim Chirico, and the role seemed unenviable at best.\nJob Done! How Masarek Rejuvenated Avaya\nUnfortunately, Masarek couldn\u2019t prevent Avaya from entering a second bankruptcy in five years, with its debts reaching $3.4BN.\nWhile that miffed shareholders \u2013 many of whom were Avaya employees \u2013 the prepackaged bankruptcy gave him the means to take the company private, cut its debts by 75+ percent, install a new C-suite, and breathe new life into its innovation cycle.\nYet, perhaps most crucially, he created that \u201cinnovation without disruption\u201d vision for the company.\nThe vision recognizes that many enterprise on-premise contact centers want a slower, more cautious migration to the cloud: an evolution, not revolution approach.\nWith this vision, he led Avaya as it streamlined its portfolio, established new partnerships, and shored up its enterprise retention rate, which now stands at 97 percent.\nMaintaining that enterprise base is crucial. That\u2019s its lifeblood. And, given everything that has happened at Avaya, that percentage is somewhat remarkable.\nIn addition, Avaya recently announced that it had exceeded revenue forecasts and even acquired Edify, a rival enterprise communications player known for its journey orchestration prowess.\nBut Masarek didn\u2019t want to take all the plaudits. Instead, he praised the commitment of Avaya employees, partners, and customers in delivering on the vision.\n\u201cTwo years ago, I came out of retirement to help lead Avaya forward, knowing that the company\u2019s opportunity was extremely profound: terrific technology underpinning an enormous customer base, a massive ecosystem of partners, a large revenue base, and an iconic technology brand,\u201d he said.\nWorking closely with Avaya\u2019s executive leadership team, the Board, our employees, customers, and partners has been an immeasurably rewarding experience. I\u2019m proud of what we have all accomplished together to put Avaya on a strong and steady course for further success.\n\u201cAnd, while there is certainly more to do, Avaya\u2019s new position of strength combined with Patrick\u2019s unique ability to lead the company creates an opportunity for me to return to retirement, fully confident in Patrick\u2019s ability to lead Avaya.\u201d\nNotably, this isn\u2019t the first time Masarek has left a company in a \u201cposition of strength\u201d after arriving at a difficult time.\nIndeed, at Vonage, he took over another company when it was enduring a stock price slump and was best known for a series of \u2013 with hindsight \u2013 crazy TV ads. (Any excuse to share this prime example).\nThere, Masarek masterminded an acquisition streak \u2014 including CCaaS vendor NewVoiceMedia and CPaaS provider Nexmo \u2014 which ultimately led to Ericsson\u2019s $6.2BN takeover.\nThat experience made him the ideal candidate for Avaya, and \u2013 in his two years \u2013 Masarek showed real vision at a time when it would have been easy to spew the same AI hyperbole as its many competitors.\nOf course, there were grueling moments, too, including that post-bankruptcy shareholder pushback and a reseller scandal.\nHowever, overall, Masarek\u2019s vision has earned him significant respect within the industry, which he can take onto the golf course as he enjoys a hard-earned retirement."

If this perceived undervaluation continues, BT could consider spinning off Openreach after the fibre rollout is complete, however Kirkby said she would prefer the share price to improve rather than having to resort to yet another spinoff.\nSpeaking about BT's latest full fiscal year, which ended on March 31, Kirkby said the company had realized \"over \u00a3900m of annualized cost savings.\" She blamed \"lower international sales and handsets\" on the 2% dip in revenue, to \u00a320.4 billion.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBT's reach across the UK could be about to get even stronger, with The Guardian revealing that the company could have entered initial discussions to buy out TalkTalk, a smaller broadband provider that has struggled financially.\nHowever, such an acquisition, together with BT's ownership of mobile network provider EE, could spell out great domination over UK networks, potentially sparking an antitrust investigation.\nThe recently-completed merger of Three and Vodafone was subject to an in-depth investigation before eventually approved by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nYou might also like\n- Openreach declares aim to accelerate UK high-speed broadband rollout\n- Want to maximize your signal?

      "text": "Avaya has offered \u201ceveryone at the company\u201d a voluntary exit package, a person familiar with the matter told CX Today.\nThe source revealed that Avaya hopes the move will shed \u201ca lot of employees\u201d.\nCX Today has reached out to Avaya for a statement, but the company declined to comment.\nThe objective to shed employees is one Avaya has chased since its CEO transition, announced in July 2024.\nJust four months later, Avaya kick-started a sweeping round of layoffs. While these initially impacted North America, they stretched across the globe by early 2025.\nIn January, CX Today learned the layoffs left some regions, including Europe and the Middle East, threadbare.\nNow, Avaya appears to be following up with another drastic move to cut its staff further and leave some areas with little more than a remote presence.\nReacting to the speculation, Zeus Kerravala, Principal Analyst at ZK Research, told CX Today:\nSuch a move would likely aim to maximize profitability, so Avaya can return profit to equity holders.\nHaving only emerged from a second bankruptcy in seven years in 2023, these headlines will fan the flames of speculation about Avaya\u2019s long-term future.\nAfter all, if and when it does return that equity to its holders, what\u2019s next? Yet another reset for a company long defined by restructuring.\nAvaya\u2019s Future Hinges on Its Partners\nOnce dominant in contact centers and unified communications, Avaya missed the shift to CCaaS and UCaaS, despite initially experimenting with cloud-based services like Avaya OneCloud, AXP, Avaya Spaces, and Zang Cloud.\nThese experiments highlight Avaya\u2019s troubling pattern of missing early market signals, weak execution, and late timing.\nAs a result, it has leaned more and more on its partners to overlay its core infrastructure with the latest cloud innovations. That led to a rising reliance on the likes of RingCentral, Verint, and Zoom.\nIt 2024 Annual Customer Report spotlights these alliances, with Verint powering CX automation and Zoom Workplace bolstering collaboration.\nYet, Verint\u2019s new owner, Thoma Bravo, and Zoom\u2019s own enterprise ambitions highlight the vulnerability in its story of outsourcing innovation.\nIndeed, the strategy is playing with fire. If Thoma Bravo decides to completely restructure Verint and turn its roadmap upside down, many of Avaya\u2019s customers\u2019 roadmaps will be turned upside down.\nGiven how much of Avaya\u2019s customer base are steady Eddie enterprises, that\u2019s a big concern.\nAs such, the exits could also be a move to get out in front of future disruptions. Nevertheless, they\u2019re not a good look for the trouble-plagued business.\nThe Bottom Line\nAvaya\u2019s cloud story has become increasingly fragmented, partner-reliant, and dependent on protecting its base. It\u2019s not disrupting the market and chasing growth.\nThat\u2019s evidenced by its reported strategy to fixate on keeping its top 1,500 global enterprise customers.\nWith that strategy, Avaya has framed itself as a stable choice for conservative, hybrid enterprise contact center environments.\nHowever, the continued employee exits and the control its partners have over its own destiny somewhat counteract that image.\nThat will give its customers plenty of food for thought. For so long, they\u2019ve valued continuity at the expense of reinvention. Yet, these similar, repeated headlines may make them question this approach.\nThanks to Tim Banting, Head of Research & Business Intelligence at Techtelligence, for co-authoring this article."

A further 305 workers lost their jobs this month, with 14,000 roles affected in 2023 and 2024.\nIn April 2025, Microsoft said it would outsource sales to small and mid-sized customers to third-party firms \u2013 an indication of the changes believed to be coming as soon as next month.\nDespite widespread job losses, Microsoft continues to perform well financially. Last quarter, it reported a 13% increase in revenue to $70.1 billion. It currently holds the title of the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.569 trillion.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nAt the time, CFO Amy Hood stated that overall company headcount was 2% up year-over-year, but slightly down quarter-over-quarter, suggesting constant fluctuations.\nTechRadar Pro has asked Microsoft to confirm plans to lay off workers after the current quarter draws to a close, but we did not receive an immediate response.\nWhile highly disappointing for the company's workers, Microsoft employees aren't alone in facing job uncertainty.

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nMake teamwork really work\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy to ensure that teamwork really works.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork. Co-create in Real-Time with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Start Your Google Workspace Free Trial. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best task management apps.\nThe best online collaboration tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online collaboration tool for comms\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSlack is without doubt a mighty collaboration tool, with millions of users around the globe. It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it. The only thing we could wish for is better support channels.\nRead our full Miro review.\nBest online collaboration tool for tracking\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest online collaboration tool for organizing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have ever looked into project management software and online collaboration tools, then no doubt you\u2019ve come across Trello. Available on the web and with mobile apps, it lets you easily organize projects and work on them with colleagues.\nThe platform allows you to work with boards or lists, which can be organized by teams and different tasks. And within these, you can set up to-do lists and delegate amongst colleagues. There\u2019s also the option to assign comments to cards \u2013 a quick way to give feedback to others.\nFurthermore, Trello boasts a number of integrations with apps such as Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive and Slack. You can download the app for free, but there are premium options available which give access to more features.\nThe Premium pricing tier unlocks a number of additional administrative features for better organization. There's also an Enterprise edition which is priced according to the number of users required, and provides some additional organizational management features.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest online collaboration tool space\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Workspace (formerly called G Suite) is Google's answer to Microsoft 365, and more. This is one of the best platforms you can choose for an organization because it comes with a lot of features.\nThink of this software as the enterprise version of all the popular Google tools you use. For instance, you can create custom business emails for staff that uses the same interface as the popular Gmail app. People can create and edit documents collaboratively on Google Docs; you\u2019ll see any changes in real time, and anyone is free to make comments and suggestions for any changes.\nThere's Meet, a video-conferencing solution for enterprises; this tool for valuable for colleagues to stay in touch with each other, especially for remote companies. There\u2019s also Google Chat, a messaging tool for enterprises; Google Drive for file sharing; Google Sheets for spreadsheets; and a shared calendar tool that enables colleagues to keep tabs on each other\u2019s schedules. These tools are what you\u2019ll get access to as a Google Workspace subscriber.\nA Starter plan includes 30GB storage per user and a maximum of 100 participants in video meetings. The Standard plan includes 2TB of storage and up to 150 participants in video meetings. The Plus plan includes 5TB of storage per user and up to 500 participants in video meetings. There's also an Enterprise plan that offers as much storage and video meeting participants as you need; this plan has no standard pricing, so you'll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nYou can save on your Google Workspace subscription with our Google Workspace promo codes.\nRead our full Google Workspace review.\nBest online collaboration platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAirtable is a platform that supports extensive online collaboration and project management. You can use it to share data seamlessly within an organization for people to collaborate. This platform has extensive third-party integration, so you can sync data from other apps and ensure it is always up-to-date.\nAirtable is not just a standalone collaborative tool. It is actually a platform on which people can build collaborative apps. It touts itself as \u201clow-code\u201d, meaning you don\u2019t need sophisticated programming skills to build apps on it, although a little will help. Anyone in your organization can build an app on Airtable to foster collaboration.\nYou can start with the free plan, which has limitations on the file sizes and the number of collaborators. Thus, you\u2019ll need a paid plan to maximize your use of this platform, and you can choose from one of three such plans; Plus, Pro, and Enterprise.\nThe Plus plan supports an unlimited number of users. The limitation is that you'll get a maximum of 5GB space per base (which refers to a project) and a maximum of 5,000 records for each base. The Pro plan increases the storage space to 20GB per base with a maximum of 50,000 records for each base. The Enterprise plan is the highest, giving you up to 1TB of space per base and 100,000 records; this plan has no standard pricing, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nRead our full Airtable review.\nBest online collaboration tool for mobile\nReasons to buy\nPodio describes itself as a flexible and customizable online platform for work and communication among teams. In other words, it gives you a way to organize large stacks of work and to delegate tasks between employees.\nJust like many of the other business collaboration apps out there, Podio provides you with the tools to share files, view the status of ongoing projects and get feedback on the things you\u2019re currently working on. These functionalities are combined into an easy-to-use interface.\nPodio is also equipped with quality mobile apps for when you\u2019re out and about, and need to use your smartphone or tablet, and it has an impressive amount of integration with third-party services and apps including Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and Zendesk.\nRead our full Podio review.\nBest online collaboration tool for ease-of-use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRyver is similar to Slack, aiming to give your organization a highly effective means of communication, and an easy way to talk over tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met.\nWhat makes Ryver a compelling option is the fact that you can create as many teams as you want within the app, and easily categorize them to boot. As is the case with Slack, you can use the platform to set up chats with groups and individuals.\nThere are some interesting filters, too. You can control who sees the things you say and post in the app, and obviously enough, join the teams that are most relevant to you. All company posts are located within a Facebook-style newsfeed, and you can mark posts to come back to them later on.\nThere\u2019s also a host of native clients across mobile and desktop, including Mac and Linux. There's also a premium version for enterprise which offers workflow automation, Single Sign-On (SSO), and advanced team management.\nRead our full Ryver review.\nBest online collaboration tool for designers\n10. InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards. In this case, the board is virtual, and you are free to write text while discussing with your team about a work project. You can also add images, photos, videos, etc., to provide context for your ideas.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll need templates to explain an idea to your teammates, e.g., flowcharts and interactive widgets. The good thing is that InVision provides over 200 pre-built templates that you can use for this.\nThe Freehand tool also has direct integrations with a lot of third-party software. For example, you can open a video chat by connecting to Zoom or Webex or turn your whiteboard ideas directly into tasks on Jira and Asana. If you wish, you can import your existing whiteboards from other collaborative apps, e.g., Miro.\nThis platform was built mainly for designers but is not exclusive to them. It is also suitable for product teams, human resource (HR) teams, marketing teams, etc.\nOther collaborative software to consider\nThere are many other collaboration tools worth your attention, if nothing else because of the way they apply features differently, or even add other useful features. Here we'll look at some additional online collaboration tools that could be worth exploring further:\nVisme is developed specifically for collaborative online reports, presentations, and infographics. Aside from promoting branding support and aiming to reduce design costs, analytics are provided so you can see which presentations and reports result in the most engagement, and adjust accordingly. Visme recommends itself for sales and marketing, HR and recruiting, internal communications, as well as education and in-house training. The software is specifically priced around individual, business, or education use.\nBasecamp aims to be an all-in-one collaboration and communications platform, to bring features of multiple software offerings into a single place so that it's easier to sort through information, and, of course, keep it all in one easy to manage place. Features include chat, messageboards, to-do lists and scheduling as well as automated check-in, as well as a single place to store all documents, files, and folders. Unlike other collaborative software that charges per user, Basecamp charges a single fee of $99.99 for unlimited users, which could make it especially attractive to larger organizations.\nWrike is more of a project management and scheduling tool, that makes it easy to see where everyone is in terms of completing a project. As a standalone it might seem quite limited compared to some of the others here, but its strength lies in its extensive range of integrations, which includes Google, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft, Adobe, and Github. This means Wrike can work as a central platform tied to a number of others software apps, allowing you to cover a wider range of options and features than some standalone software options.\nMonday.com is a platform that allows you to plan, track, and collaborate on projects in a visually simple manner. Drag-and-drop functionality and ease of use make this a particularly good platform for project management and general workflow management among teams. It also integrates with Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, so you can use it a central focal point for teams to work together. As above, these integrations mean that monday.com can be used to achieve a wider working remit than the standalone platform itself.\nWe've also featured the best small business software.\nBest online collaboration tool FAQs\nTips for choosing a suitable online collaboration tool\n1. Consider your budget and look for something that\u2019s affordable for your enterprise. If you\u2019re a large organization with a sizeable IT budget, you can go with a more expensive platform that\u2019ll give you access to sophisticated features that you may not even need much. In contrast, if you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s wise to choose a plan that gives you just the basic collaboration features at a reasonable price.\n2. Customer support. Things can go wrong at any time, so choose a platform that offers customer support via email, live chat, or telephone. Check user reviews to see what other people are saying about your intended platform\u2019s support before making a final choice.\n3. Look for a platform with a user-friendly interface. This will make it easy for employees of your organization to collaborate instead of losing productivity trying to figure out how to use the software.\n4. Choose a platform with a strong security reputation to avoid leaks or theft of sensitive data.\n5. Pick a platform that has integrations with third-party tools for additional functionalities that you may need.\nWhich online collaboration tools is best for you?\nWhen deciding which online collaboration tool to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to work with a handful of people on a casual basis may find a cheaper option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use online collaboration tools for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced options that are included.\nHow we tested the best online collaboration tools\nTo test for the best online collaboration tools we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use online collaboration tools regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best productivity tool of 2025\nHave teams work better\nWe list the best productivity tools, to make it simple and easy to have your teams work more effectively and efficiently.\nProductivity tools do this not just by focusing on simplifying routine tasks, but also by making collaboration and project management much easier for teams. This is especially useful so that no matter where any individual is, they can remain in contact with the rest of their team and provide the latest updates and information that everyone needs.\nProductivity tools also include essential management features, to prioritize schedules and work to deadlines, such as for time management and task management. The also interface needs to be simple and easy to use so that managers do not become bogged down in administrating it all. Additionally, everything needs to be presented in a clear way so that contact management information is easy to find and action.\nThere are also other tools that can help improve productivity and efficiency, simply by making complex tasks simpler and easier to do. This could be anything from managing backups to social media monitoring, or the best CRM software.\nBelow we list what we think are the best productivity apps currently available.\nYour Complete Productivity Suite.

Upgrade to Google Workspace and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nThe best productivity tool of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest productivity tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office is probably the platform most people think of first when it comes to office productivity suites, with the cloud-based Microsoft 365 being the latest incarnation.\nWhat ensured that MS Office became a market leader is the comprehensive way data can be covered by different applications and moved between them, making working more efficient and hassle-free. With Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook forming the core programs, these cover everything from documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and emails - in effect covering most essential office needs. In addition to that, OneDrive offers online saving and backups to keep your files safe.\nWhile there are alternatives to MS Office, most rivals attempt to play catch-up with Microsoft rather than provide innovative new features, and MS Office still remains the office suite with the most comprehensive range of features. And even if you do use one of these alternatives, the chances are you are going to be working with document formats created specifically for MS Office, and handle data from customers and suppliers who are using the MS Office platform.\nWhile MS Office does have its critics, the bottom line is that nobody does office productivity better than Microsoft, and the core applications in Office have yet to be bettered.\nThe yearly Personal plan costs around $70 / \u00a365 / AU$105 and includes up to 1 TB of cloud storage per user for up to 5 devices.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest productivity tool for collaboration\nReasons to buy\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results.

Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly.

Premium tracks team projects and includes many extra features such as advanced searches, a workflow builder and custom fields. The Business plan offers everything in Premium plus added resources such as portfolios, advanced reporting and time tracking.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest productivity tool for versatility\nReasons to buy\nTrello is a smartly designed and popular service for managing, organizing and sharing everything from simple to-dos to major project management tasks.\nGetting started is as easy as dragging cards onto a Trello board. Cards can represent single tasks, with priorities and deadlines attached. But they can also be more substantial checklists, with attached files and pictures, containing hyperlinks to point somewhere else.\nAnd there's a whole library of Power-Ups, custom cards which allow you to integrate a host of third-party services into your workflow: Box, Evernote, GIPHY, GitHub, Hangouts, Join.me, Mailchimp, OneDrive, Salesforce, Slack, SmartDraw, SurveyMonkey, Twitter, ZenDesk and more.\nTrello has plenty of collaboration tools to help you manage your projects, and a stack of ingenious features to ensure it's user-friendly. Just one example: the Cloud Aging power-up visibly ages cards if they've not been accessed for a while, fading them out, maybe turning them yellow and even cracking. This isn't just a visual gimmick \u2013 it allows users to instantly see underused cards on even the busiest of boards, a real timesaver.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest productivity tool for features\nReasons to buy\nBitrix24 provides a vast suite of powerful business tools: collaboration, instant messaging, telephony, project management, document handling, scheduling, employee management, and more.\nIf you prefer to keep things simple then you can concentrate on the excellent CRM, which is a capable system all on its own. Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, the Plus account offers more features.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nBest free productivity app\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTodoist straddles the categories of time management tools and to-do lists, with an element of project management thrown in for good measure. Despite touching on multiple genres, the tool remains easy to use, making it possible to manage multiple project with ease, and see at a glance what you still have to do.\nThe website or app gives you a daily and weekly overview of what work you have to do, what appointment you have, or whatever else you choose to track. If you're working with a group of people and find that your workload is getting a little heavy, you can delegate tasks to others.\nThe free version limits you to working with five people and having 80 active projects on the go at any one time, and this should be more than enough for most people, but Premium and Business plans are available for a fee. Todoist offers integration with dozens of apps and services so it can tie in neatly to your existing workflow.\nRead our full Todoist review.\n2. RescueTime\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRescueTime not only tracks the time you spend doing different things on your computer or mobile \u2013 such as visiting particular websites or using specific apps \u2013 it does so automatically. Running in the background as it does, RescueTime quietly logs your activity without serving as a distraction.\nIt's possible to set yourself targets and alerts, and the idea is that these goals will help you to develop better working habits. It enables you to see just how you spend your day on your digital devices so you can better understand where the time has gone. There free version of the app enables you to look back at three months of data for analysis, but paid-for packages (which start at $6 per month) have no limits and includes a number of extra features.\nFor most people, the free version will be more than enough, and the fact that it is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and ChromeOS means that it is possible to track work across multiple devices and platforms.\n3. Beeminder\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBeeminder is quite a unique tool that can be used to track and monitor everything from running or trips to the gym, to logging how often you write, or managing a to-do list. Available as an app, or usable online, Beeminder is endlessly flexible \u2013 you define your goal (whatever that may be) and you are tasked with logging your progress. There is a degree of gamification to things here; you're aiming to stick to the 'yellow brick road', which means that, at least on average, you are hitting your targets.\nAnything that can be plotted on a graph can be tracked \u2013 number of words written, number of hours worked, number of contracts signed \u2013 and sticking within the golden zone can be hugely incentivizing. If you're willing to commit fully, you can add your credit card details to your account so you can be fined for failing to stay on track. Beeminder is not for everyone one, but it is so unique, it is well worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.\n4. Toggl\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToggl is described by its developers as \u2018insanely simple time tracking\u2019, and that's a pretty fair summary. If you take a look at the website, it is the premium versions of the service that are pushed, but there is a free version suitable for teams of up to five people.\nToggl is available for multiple platforms and synchronization means that you can move between devices and stick track your work. There's a lot to explore here, including manual and automated track of activity, a Pomodoro timer, automatic detection of idle time, reminders, integrations with various apps and services and much, much more.\nThe beauty of Toggl, however, is that it is so flexible and customizable. What ever you're looking to monitor, you can probably bend it to your will. The detailed reports are impressive, but it's a bit of shame to see that there is no invoicing option in an otherwise feature-packed tool.\n5. Clockify\nReasons to buy\nClockify grabs the idea of clocking on and off for a shift and runs with it. It is a very simple tool, but that's precisely what will make it so appealing to people \u2013 after all, if you're busy with work, you don't to be overwhelmed with a complex tool for tracking what you're doing!\nClockify is essentially a basic stopwatch so you can easily record how long you spend working on different project. Just start the timers, and you can add labels, descriptions and project details, and just hit stop when you're done. You can configure timers to start as soon as you open your browser so you don't need to remember to do so.\nClockify integrates with Trello, Asana, Jira, Todoist and more, and you can use the website and apps to view details reports and breakdown of how you have spent your time. If you would like to keep Clockify available at all times without the need to dedicate a browser tab to it, you'll be pleased to hear that there is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that keep it just a click away. There are also mobile apps, and desktop versions for macOS, Windows and Linux.\nBest productivity tool FAQs\nWhich productivity tool is best for you?\nWhen deciding which productivity tool to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free platforms may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile.

Advances in cloud technology mean that video conferencing has become accessible and affordable to the masses.\nFor businesses this means being able to support remote working, which has been found to be increasingly important for many employees to help with their work-life balance, and improve their morale.\nVideo conferencing for businesses also means being able to save on unnecessary travel costs, which has the additional benefit of helping to reduce carbon emissions. This can be particularly beneficial for large and small businesses alike where long distance travel could prove not just expensive but also disruptive.\nHowever, the same video conferencing technology available for business is also available to home users, for keeping up with friends and family. Often the same video conferencing providers will cover both business and home users.\nWe've therefore covered the best video conferencing software solutions - both paid-for and free, and linked through to reviews we've recently carried out.\nSmarter Video Meetings are Here. Let Gemini AI Take Notes for You. Discover Google Meet and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best business phone systems.\nThe best video conferencing software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest video conferencing software for webinar hosts\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nClickMeeting is absolutely loaded with features for webinar hosts. To start with, the software includes just about all the tools you could want during a presentation. You can share your screen, play slideshows and videos, and even let attendees take over your mouse to explore an interactive display. Better yet, ClickMeeting supports question-and-answer sessions and live polls, so you can get your audience participating and collect valuable data about attendees.\nWhat\u2019s really exciting about ClickMeeting for data-driven businesses is how the software integrates with analytics and marketing tools. You can embed a Facebook pixel on your webinar\u2019s landing page or connect that page to Google Analytics. Your webinar page is also fully customizable, enabling you to show off your brand.\nClickMeeting even offers integrations with a number of popular business apps. You can link your Dropbox to have your webinar recordings automatically stored in the cloud, or use Zapier to integrate with some of the best CRM software or email marketing platforms.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about ClickMeeting if your company relies on webinars to garner leads or stay in touch with employees. This video conferencing software has a number of tools for keeping audiences engaged during meetings, plus automated follow-ups so you can capitalize on a successful webinar. The integrations are also a huge plus for productivity. For everything this software offers, the price is fairly reasonable, too.\nRead our full ClickMeeting review.\nBest video conferencing software for office use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRingCentral's RingEx offers the full range of industry-standard video conferencing features across all of its plans. These include, among many others, video call scheduling and recording, screen sharing and annotation, and in-built chat functionalities.\nUndoubtedly, however, RingCentral\u2019s greatest feature is its integration of Slack, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365. This means users can schedule and begin calls directly from these 3rd party platforms. Users are also able to integrate their calendar with the RingCentral platform, and easily visualize their schedule for the day. This cross-platform integration also makes RingCentral ideal for businesses that already use Slack, Google Workspace, or Microsoft 365 for digital collaboration.\nRingCentral\u2019s analytics dashboard is another powerful feature enabling administrators to monitor the usage of the service, and pinpoint performance issues down to the exact location, ISP, network, and endpoint. Such in-depth analytical analysis is uncommon and makes RingCentral particularly appealing for organizations where video quality and performance is a priority.\nOverall, RingCentral is a solid performer that offers high-quality video conferencing software for businesses. It is loaded with features, offers a high degree of administrator control, and is optimized to work on web browsers, minimizing the need for additional applications and software.\nRead our full RingCentral Video review.\nBest video conferencing software with AI\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDialpad Meetings (formerly UberConference) is a well-known video-conferencing platform with many features. It has noteworthy high video and audio quality which is important. The user can pick their own layout, hold music, and meeting URL to keep things exactly as they like. You can join meetings on any device using a web browser or by downloading the app on iOS, Android, Windows, or macOS.\nThe main selling point for Dialpad\u2019s video conferencing tool is incorporating artificial intelligence features. For instance, you can get live transcriptions of your video calls, which makes it easier to understand what the person you\u2019re conversing with is saying. The transcriptions are not perfect but are accurate enough for a layman to understand. You can also get a transcription automatically delivered to your email after each video meeting so that you can go through it later.\nThis software is good for collaboration within an enterprise. You can share your screen while streaming video so that everyone can understand what you\u2019re saying better. You can chat while video calling and send out relevant files and links in the same messaging channel for meeting participants. This app supports picture-in-picture mode, meaning you can participate in video meetings while using another app; you will see the video in a floating window while you work on another app or document.\nRead our full Dialpad review.\nBest affordable\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoom offers a video conferencing and messaging solution for desktop and app for mobile devices, that aims to be very quick and easy to set up, and offer a wide range of scaleable features.\nNot only does it provide HD video and audio, but it can support up to 1,000 participants at the same time, and up to 49 videos on a single screen, though such large gatherings are probably best suited to big-screen monitors.\nMeetings can be saved locally or to the cloud, along with transcripts that have searchable text to work with. Additionally, collaboration is built in with the ability for participants to share their screens and work together to provide their own notes as required.\nOn top of this a team chat feature allows for file sharing, a searchable history, and a ten year archive. Meetings can also be escalated into one-on-one calls. Security is built-in, using 256-bit TLS encryption for both meetings and shared files, and automated scheduling can be done from Gmail, Outlook, and iCal.\nEven better is that a feature-rich free tier is available, and able to accommodate up to 100 people for up to 40 minutes, but to include additional tools for team administration and management and for more dedicated business and enterprise use.\nRead out full Zoom review.\nBest video conferencing software for mobile\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoToMeeting is the standalone videoconferencing service provided by LogMeIn. As expected it provides audio and video conferencing, as well as screensharing, and we've provided a guide on how to use GoToMeeting.\nOne of the features that sets GoToMeetings apart is its mobile friendliness - you can set up and start a conference from your smartphone, something some big brand software would struggle to do. There are also settings to maximize call and image quality, as well as one-tap invites to join meetings as well as chats.\nMobile apps are provided separately for Android and iOS, and both have high positive review volumes, which again makes a change from some other providers who struggle to balance quality and usability with mobile use.\nIn terms of pricing, almost all standard features are available with the most basic payment tier. Even the limit of 150 participants is generous, and for most businesses this is all that will be required.\nA Business plan tier is available which increases the number of participants to 250 and includes a few admin features plus drawing tools and mouse sharing. An Enterprise plan is available to accommodate up to 3,000 participants.\nHowever, while there are many good things to be said for GoToMeetings, if you're looking for a business VoIP solution then GoToConnect offers a cloud-based phone system which integrates GoToMeetings as part of the package, and it may be more cost-effective to sign up for that instead.\nRead our full GoToMeeting review.\nBest video conferencing software for advanced features\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRemotePC Meeting is backed by a number of video conferencing features designed to streamline the collaboration process. For starters, you can create a meeting instantly and share it with your colleagues or employees via a clickable link. The Chrome extension makes it even easier to share meeting links, and the program can be integrated with Google, Outlook, or Yahoo calendars.\nAdditionally, meetings can be joined using VoIP for improved security and in situations where a person\u2019s internet connection is limited. There\u2019s no maximum limit on the number of team members you can add to a video conference, and there are also several built-in individual and group chat tools.\nYou can also share your screen to make it easier to deliver presentations or make a point. All sessions can be recorded and saved as video or audio files for future reference, and there\u2019s even a collaborative whiteboard that allows you to brainstorm ideas with other meeting participants.\nRemotePC Meeting provides advanced video conferencing tools, but they are only available with a remote access subscription. If you want a pure video conferencing program, there are various other options available.\nUltimately, RemotePC Meeting provides powerful video conferencing tools backed by a range of great features and an easy-to-use interface. The only criticism is that there isn\u2019t anything unique on offer, but that's hardly a big complaint and RemotePC remains a viable option, especially for those who need remote access tools as well.\nRead our full RemotePC Meeting review.\nBest accessible video conferencing software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWithin one application, Microsoft Teams enables users to schedule video or audio meetings with a single person or a team. Administrators can also organize webinars and large meetings with up to 10,000 participants.\nFull integration with Microsoft 365 means that calls can be easily scheduled and invites shared among the organization, while external guests can join from their web browser without downloading the application.\nMicrosoft Teams also provides the full range of features expected from a leading video conferencing software provider, including screen sharing and call recording, live captions, background blur technology, and chat functionalities. Integration with Microsoft 365 makes the platform the market leader in video conferencing and digital workspace integration.\nThe platform\u2019s powerful video conferencing software is complemented by hardware options that enable users to join calls from almost anywhere. When you\u2019re working alone or on the go, mobile devices, desktop computers, and Bluetooth conferencing headsets can power communication.\nOverall, Microsoft Teams is ideal for businesses who already use Microsoft 365, or who are looking to reinvent their organization\u2019s digital communication and collaboration workspaces. Additionally, it's also great for home users to connect with friends and family who also use Microsoft 365.\nRead our full Microsoft Teams review.\nBest video conferencing software for Google Workspace\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Meet, formerly Google Hangouts Meet, is part of the Google Workspace office productivity platform (formerly known as G Suite). Having enjoyed a recent rebrand, Google Meet aims to provide a first-class conferencing service.\nDeveloped specifically for business needs, it can cater for a large number of users at once, and also uses smart participation and a fast interface to reduce the need to wait.\nAs an updated version of the standard Google Hangouts, Google Meet aims to make it easier to work with external clients. It does this first by providing a web app experience, which means there is no software to download. Secondly, it also provides a dedicated dial-in number, which not only means that employees on the go can join in, but this also ensure that line quality is maintained and that there are no drop-outs.\nAs well as having dedicated apps available for mobile users in the Apple AppStore and Google Play store for Android, Google Meet can also work with existing conferencing hardware. All that's required is that it follows SIP and H.323 standards for Skype for Business users. This also applies to Cisco, Lifesize, and Polycomm in particular, and by using Pexip Infinity can join in Hangouts meets.\nAnother key advantage is that by being within the Google Workspace platform it's easy to use data from other Google applications, not least Google Calendar, to not just plan meetings but also set up event information as required when users do sign in.\nUltimately, Google Meet is a serious business-grade conferencing platform that doesn't require big up-front costs for hardware, making it especially accessible for businesses of any size.\nHowever, Google Meet still struggles to compete on features with dedicated video conferencing providers, and the interface has arguably become less user-friendly compared to the previously popular Google Hangouts.\nRead our full Google Meet review.\nBest video conferencing software for multimedia\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCyberLink is a Taiwanese multimedia software company. It was founded in 1996. U Meeting is the company\u2019s video conferencing solution.\nCyberLink U Meeting has four pricing plans, priced according to the number of participants and hosts required. Each also includes an increasing number of features as the pricing increases, up to the Enterprise edition which offers meeting analysis, premium customer support and end-to-end encryption. Users need to contact sales for a quote.\n\u2018PerfectCam\u2019 is a most random feature. Users can add computer generated makeup to their faces with the company promising to \u2018create a truly professional look\u2019.\nU Meeting is entirely web-based. This might put some users off but it can be an advantage as you will not need to download any additional software to use U Meeting. It also does not offer video recording or the ability to dial into meetings using VoIP systems.\nRead our full CyberLink U Meeting review.\nBest video conferencing software for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoho Meeting edges out the competition when it comes to price and ease of use. However, there are a couple of drawbacks to this platform, such as the absence of advanced integrations with third-party productivity tools.\nAlthough Zoho Meeting lacks some of the fancier features available through competing services, it\u2019s worth a look for anyone who wants solid screen sharing functionality or to set up scheduled video meetings.\nEven though this video meeting platform might miss out on some common features, such as shared whiteboards and advanced integrations with third-party services, its simplicity is also an advantage, as no complex settings have to be adjusted prior to starting your first call.\nAffordability is also a major draw for Zoho Meeting customers, especially when it comes to coverage for up to 100 participants. For webinars and online conferences, Zoho Meeting is a good option.\nRead our full Zoho Meeting review.\nBest video conferencing software for online learning\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBigBlueButton is packed with features perfect for online learning webinars. During sessions, you can share audio, video, presentations, and your desktop while also collaborating with students using a whiteboard, shared notes, polls, and chat.\nWhere BigBlueButton goes further than traditional video conferencing software is in its features useful to a virtual classroom. For example, you have a multi-user whiteboard and can place students into group breakout rooms to work on problems together.\nBigBlueButton is arguably the best open-source video conferencing software solution for online learning. Compared to most video conferencing solutions it\u2019s difficult to set up, but it\u2019s free and has all the features of expensive commercial online learning video conferencing software, and performance is great.\nRead our full BigBlueButton review.\nBest cost-effective video conferencing software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s biggest cloud storage provider, and Chime is a video conferencing solution that it offers. It\u2019s suitable for enterprises that already use AWS for a lot of functions and don\u2019t want to adopt yet another separate platform for video conferencing.\nChime is noticeably easy to use. You can join a meeting with a simple tap and avoid inputting long passcodes. You can also If you have the Amazon Alexa smart speaker, a simple voice command of \u201cAlexa, start my meeting\u201d will also do the trick. You can also join by dialing in with your mobile phone or providing your number for Amazon Chime to call you.\nWhen participating in a meeting, you're free to share your screen to help others follow along. If you're the organizer, you can monitor the visual roster to know who has joined or declined your meeting invitation, who is currently speaking, the source of background noise, etc. Picture-in-picture mode is supported, so you can participate in a meeting while doing something else on your device. If you wish, you can record your meeting and replay it when needed. This software has a chat feature, so you can talk directly with a participant or with multiple participants within a chat room. You can also enable chatbots within your chat rooms.\nThe main drawback we observed is that Chime\u2019s user interface is clunky and can be confusing. It needs a lot of improvement in the user-friendliness criteria.\nRead our full Amazon Chime review.\nBest free video conference software\nNormal consumer offerings such as Apple's Facetime, WhatsApp Video and Zoom have made video conferencing apps a normalized part of the communications process, especially as the best alternatives to Skype. Getting an accessible and affordable tool is vital, so here is our round up of the best free video conferencing apps around today.\nWe've also featured the best bluetooth headsets.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor a free software, 8x8 has an impressive array of features. The one that most users will turn to immediately is calendar app integration. 8x8 has custom browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox and plugins for Google Calendar and Office 365, any of which you can use to quickly schedule meetings and invite participants.\nWithin meetings, you can easily share your screen, chat with other participants, or raise your hand to signal that you have a question or want a chance to speak up. You can also record any meeting or create a live stream, even without a paid subscription. The only advanced feature that 8x8 is missing was an in-meeting survey function, although we haven\u2019t seen this functionality for free in any video conferencing software.\nWhat's especially good about 8x8 is that you\u2019re not missing out on key features with a free plan, since upgrading mostly serves to unlock speech-to-text for transcription. The only minor complaint is the lack of detail about the platform\u2019s security.\nRead our full 8x8 Video Meetings review.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith a name like Cisco behind it, expectations for Webexare understandably high \u2013 and it doesn't disappoint. While there are various plans available for Webex, for most circumstances the free version should be just fine. This enables you to hold HD video meetings with up to 100 participants, and to take advantage of options such as screen sharing and private chat rooms.\nWhen you sign up for an account, you are assigned a personal URL that can be used to manage all of your meetings, schedule video conferences, and access the recording you have made.\nWhen it comes to holding a video meeting, you have the choice between using the Webex app or just sticking with the website, though it could be argued that the desktop apps give a smoother experience. There are also mobile apps available.\nSecurity is catered for by TLS 1.2 and AES 256-bit encryption, and backed by Cisco's networking know-how means performance is impressive.\nRead our full Cisco Webex Meetings review.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFreeConference keeps things beautifully simple for users by not requiring any software to be installed. There are mobile apps available, but it is possible to take part in a video conferencing session from just about any device with a web browser installed. You can participant in text or video chats, and use features such as screen and file sharing \u2013 but FreeConference is not without its limitations.\nThe maximum number of conference participants is five, which rules this out as a tool for many small businesses who may regularly want to host meetings for more people.\nA number of international dial-in numbers are available for conference calls, and you have the option of recording calls if you like. Configuring, managing and scheduling meetings is very simple with FreeConference \u2013 including from Outlook \u2013 and there are some nice touches such as being able to set up recurring meetings. It's a shame that features such as advanced security, video recording and transcriptions are only part of premium packages, but the free version is still pretty powerful.\nRead our full Freeconference.com review.\n4. Livestorm\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLivestorm is another well-known video conferencing tool. It keeps things simple by allowing you to join a video meeting from any device with an active internet connection and web browser. There\u2019s no mobile or desktop app, which we consider a drawback, but the browser-based platform works very well.\nThis software is very user-friendly and supports seamless collaboration. You can open a virtual whiteboard during video meetings to jot down ideas and brainstorm with participants. The physical whiteboard is a staple at many offices, and this is no different except being online. Multiple meeting participants can write on the whiteboard at the same time and exchange ideas.\nLivestorm is a very customizable tool. You can use custom branding for all your meeting assets such as registration pages, email invitations, and backgrounds. It also has many interactive features such as creating polls to get opinions from participants and enabling participants to vote on questions that they want to be answered. You can create recurring events with multiple sessions or on-demand events that participants can join at any time.\nLivestorm was actually designed as a tool for hosting webinars with a large number of participants, but it doubles as a video conferencing tool for individuals and businesses. The free tier allows a maximum of 30 attendees in an online meeting and up to 20 minutes per session. Anything above that, and you'll have to pay for a premium plan, which starts at $110 per month.\n5. FreeConferenceCall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFreeConferenceCall is a web-based video conferencing tool. It\u2019s free and simple to use; you create an account with your email and password and receive relevant information including your dial-in number and access code in your email. Then, you can provide the dial-in number and access code alongside the date and time of the scheduled meeting. At the specified time, the participants can call the dial-in number and enter the access code to join the meeting.\nThis platform offers dial-in numbers in over 70 countries. People in non-supported countries can also dial in via Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The main flaw we observed is that FreeConferenceCall has a user interface that looks outdated and clunky.\nAlso check out these other business conferencing guides:\nBest video conferencing software FAQs\nWhich video conferencing software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which of the best video conferencing software to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to talk to a handful of people on a casual basis may find a free option is the most cost-effective as well as providing all of the necessary fundamental tools that would be needed. However, if you're planning to use video conferencing for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options.\nHow to choose the right video conferencing camera\nRene Buhay, Vice President of Sales & Marketing at leading education technology manufacturer AVer Europe, gives tips on choosing the right video conferencing camera or webcam.\nWith a wealth of camera options on the market for video conferencing, identifying what suits your needs best and is not simply the latest or recently launched model can be challenging. Most of us are working from home currently and working practices will evolve moving forward. While fundamentally all conferencing solutions will need to be adaptable, the quality, collaboration opportunities, and operational requirements of the conferencing solution must be considered to ensure the purchase is a cost-effective and sound investment.\n1. Consider the right solution for your space\nWe\u2019ve all been in meetings where the technology has let us down, and often it is because the technology is not appropriate for the meeting space or the task at hand. Perhaps the microphone is not strong enough to pick up the voices of people in the room or the camera does not fit all attendees in the field of view, or perhaps the technology is simply taking up too much space.\nWhether your meeting space is a home office, a huddle room, a large meeting space or a conference room, you should weigh up the features of different conferencing systems. An all-in-one USB solution is great for a small meeting space, for example, and would not necessarily require features such as pan-tilt-zoom or a powerful zoom.\n2. Optimize collaboration with certified solutions\nFollowing a dramatic increase in people working from home and signs of remote working being more prevalent in working practices moving forward, it\u2019s crucial that your conferencing camera is optimized to work with platforms you are using to communicate with your team.\nExplore cameras that are certified by the likes of Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and Skype for Business. Not only is this endorsement from Zoom, Google or Microsoft enough to provide confidence in the manufacturer, it also ensures that you and your team\u2019s video conferencing experience is seamless and efficient when using these platforms.\n3. Think ahead\nWhatever the size of your space or budget for technology to equip it, ideally you should be looking to find a solution that is ready for a range of scenarios that you may encounter. Plug and play solutions are ideal for this, providing minimal set up and ultimate flexibility, so you can work wherever you need to and still have the same video conferencing experience.\nIn this unprecedented year of business, forecasting may be challenging; investing in the right video conferencing solution for your needs will reap operational and communication benefits for years to come.\nHow we tested the best video conferencing software\nTo test for the best video conferencing software we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use video conferencing software regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced webinar options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?
