  "content": "Japanese pop idol Kenshin Kamimura was found guilty of a charge of indecent assault on a female interpreter in a Hong Kong court on Wednesday before some emotional fans.\n\nKamimura, a former member of a Japanese boy group named ONE N\u2019 ONLY, was arrested in the southern Chinese city of March.\n\nIn the same month, his contract was terminated due to a serious compliance violation. In April, he pleaded not guilty.\n\nHe allegedly touched the interpreter\u2019s thigh repeatedly during a celebratory dinner at a restaurant.\n\nDuring the trial last month, the interpreter testified through a live video link that Kamimura had invited her to a bathroom elsewhere.\n\nAfter she dismissed the request and told him she had a boyfriend, Kamimura continued to touch her thigh, she said.\n\nThe defense argued the interpreter exaggerated her claims, and the alleged bathroom invitation might not have been based on improper motives.\n\nJudge Peter Yu handed down the conviction on Wednesday, saying Kamimura touched the interpreter in a caressing manner that implicitly carried a sexual undertone and had indecent intent.\n\n\u201cThe defendant\u2019s acts are obviously disrespectful toward women,\u201d Yu said. \u201cSuch behavior should be condemned.\u201d\n\nIn pleading for a lesser penalty, the defense said Kamimura previously had a promising future and paid a heavy price.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced, a few of Kamimura\u2019s fans wept in the courtroom.\n\nBut Kamimura looked relieved and hugged his courtroom translator when the judge issued a fine of 15,000 Hong Kong dollars (about $1,900) and no prison term.\n\nThe maximum penalty for the charge is 10 years of imprisonment.\n\nThe singer\u2019s supporters, including some from Japan and mainland China, formed long lines inside the court building to secure a seat in the main courtroom before the hearing.\n\nAfter the hearing, they waited outside to see Kamimura, who did not speak before leaving in a car.\n\nOthers from mainland China who attended said they were not fans but wanted to learn more about the case, especially after seeing criticism of the female interpreter online.\n\nUniversity student Betty Zhong from the Chinese city of Shenzhen said she was not a Kamimura fan but attended the court hearings in Hong Kong because a friend likes the J-pop idol and she wanted to know what happened.\n\nShe said she was surprised Kamimura was charged during a visit to Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cNews reports are not so comprehensive. When I come here, I can understand it holistically and the explanations from both sides,\u201d she said.\n\nKamimura is also an actor who appeared in several TV dramas, including the boys\u2019 love series \u201cOur Youth\u201d and the popular drama \u201cOssan\u2019s Love Returns.\u201d",

It feels like an overused word, but it is the correct word. He was a devoted father. His four children were and will always be his greatest love and his greatest legacy,\u201d the obituary continued.\n\u201cHe was the son, brother, father, friend, and love you prayed to have in your life,\u201d it added. \u201cAbove all, he was a dreamer.\u201d\nBesides River and Remington, Blackstock shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18, with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth, who, like Clarkson, was not mentioned in the obit.\nJones was previously married to Greg Goose LaPoint, according to wedding photos on her Facebook page dated September 2021. It is currently unclear when the pair separated.\nAs for Blackstock and Clarkson, they married in 2013 and stayed together until the \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d singer filed for divorce in 2020.\nClarkson and her ex settled in 2022 following a long and nasty legal battle and a fight for custody of their children.\nAlthough Blackstock initially refused to leave the \u201cStronger\u201d singer\u2019s Montana ranch, the court ordered that he vacate the property in June 2022.\nHe purchased a $1.8 million ranch in Butte, Montana, shortly after, per Us Weekly, and founded Valley View Rodeo with Jones working as his executive assistant.\n\u201cI successfully assistant managed day to day for artist, Kelly Clarkson under manager, Brandon Blackstock in Los Angeles for music and television,\u201d Jones\u2019 LinkedIn profile read at the time, according to The Sun.\n\u201cAfter a change in management for Ms. Clarkson I transitioned to Executive Assistant for Mr. Blackstock\u2019s cattle operation in Montana where I currently run the office and administration work,\u201d it continued. \u201cI also currently fulfill personal assistant duties for Mr. Blackstock.\u201d\nBlackstock passed away on Aug. 7 following a lengthy battle with melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer.\nHis family announced the devastating news in a statement obtained by The Post.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d Blackstock\u2019s loved ones said.\n\u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d they added. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis later confirmed that the talent manager \u201cpassed away peacefully\u201d from melanoma at his home in Butte, Montana.\nBlackstock\u2019s eldest son, Seth, recently remembered his late father as his \u201cbest friend\u201d and \u201chero\u201d in a touching Instagram tribute.\nShelby Blackstock, the late talent manager\u2019s half-brother, also broke his silence and remembered Blackstock as \u201cfunny, bright, and full of life.\u201d\nClarkson is said to be \u201cdevastated\u201d for her two kids after her ex\u2019s tragic passing.\n\u201cWhen she found out that he was sick, she remained protective of him for their sake,\u201d an insider told People after his death.\n\u201cKelly has always tried to keep things classy,\u201d the source added. \u201cIt became clear earlier this year that Brandon was not doing well. She\u2019s been devastated for the kids.\u201d"
