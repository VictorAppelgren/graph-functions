      "title": "Josh Williams Set To Return To Xfinity Series Racing With Optum",
      "summary": "Josh Williams will return to the NASCAR Xfinity Series after parting ways with Kaulig Racing, racing the No. 45 car for Alpha Prime Racing with sponsorship from Optum and Alloy Employer Services at Daytona and other events. He plans to continue his hospital tour, visiting children’s hospitals near each track, with Optum’s partnership supporting the initiative. Williams’ stint with Kaulig produced six top‑10s in 54 races, and he is known for his old‑school driving style and ability to work on his own cars. He remains focused on improving equipment and performance for the 2026 season while maintaining his community outreach and aiming to regain his 2020‑era results.",
