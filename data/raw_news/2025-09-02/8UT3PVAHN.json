  "description": "Android's latest Play Services update now ensures your Theft Protection settings are automatically backed up and restored.",
  "content": "Google has quietly introduced an update that automatically backs up and restores the Theft Protection setting on Android devices.\n\nAndroid\u2019s Theft Protection suite, including Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, Remote Lock, and more, helps safeguard your device in case it\u2019s lost or stolen. Until now, users had to manually re-enable these protections after a factory reset or when switching to a new phone.\n\nWith the latest Play Services update, Google will now include these settings in your Android device\u2019s cloud backup. This means that when you restore your backup on a new device or your current one, your Theft Protection preferences will come back automatically, without the need to manually set them up again. It also means that if you have Theft Protection features turned off, they will remain as such when you restore your Android device from a backup.\n\nGoogle\u2019s cloud backup already saves app data, Wi-Fi networks, and other settings, and now Theft Protection is joining the list. The backup and restore feature for Theft Protection is rolling out with the September Play Services v25.34 update, which won\u2019t be available to everyone immediately and could take some time to reach all devices.",

Learn more.\nHow to enable the new theft protection feature on your Android phone\nOctober 15, 2024\nAndroid 15 came full of new features and capabilities, but Google also reminded us of some features that are available to devices with previous Android versions. Such is the case of the AI-supported theft protection feature. Let\u2019s go over what this feature is all about, and help you enable it on most devices running Android 10 or newer.\nQUICK ANSWER\nTo enable theft protection on Android, go to Settings > Google > All services > Theft protection and enable Theft Detection Lock. Tap on Turn on to confirm the change.\nHere, you can also modify extra security features like Offline Device Lock, Remote Lock, and Find & erase your device.\nJUMP TO KEY SECTIONS\nWhat is theft protection on Android?\nTheft protection is a feature that Google introduced alongside Android 15. It uses AI to detect if someone forcefully took your phone from your hands and ran away.\nYou\u2019ll also find added features within this setting to further protect your private data and information. For example, the system can lock your device if it goes offline, as it\u2019s common for thieves to turn on Airplane Mode after stealing devices.\nThere\u2019s also Remote Lock, which makes it possible to use the device\u2019s phone number to lock it. You just need to go to android.com/lock, enter the phone number, and hit Lock device.\nOf course, you can always use Find My Device for these secondary features, but it\u2019s nice to have options, and the Theft Detection Lock is certainly a nice bonus.\nHow to enable theft protection\nNow that you know what this feature is all about, it\u2019s time to learn how to enable theft protection on Android 10 or newer devices. It will come disabled by default, so make sure to turn theft protection on, as you never know when your phone will get stolen. Best be prepared!\n- Launch the Settings app.\n- Go into the Google option.\n- Tap on All services.\n- Scroll down to the Personal & device safety section.\n- Select theft protection.\n- Enable Theft Detection Lock.\n- Tap on Turn on to confirm your selection.\nOn this page, you can also enable Offline Device Lock, Remote Lock, or tap on Find & erase your device to look into your Find My Device options.\nFAQs\nTheft protection is available for most devices using Android 10 or newer.\nTheft protection uses a few tools to determine if your device was forcefully taken from your hands. These include the device\u2019s motion sensors, Wi-Fi, and smart device connections.\nNo. Theft protection is meant to protect your private information when the device is unlocked, so it will only work if your device is unlocked and in use.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Scott Brown.\nWe want to continue to bring you the very best Android and mobile tech coverage, and you can help us do that.\nWe know and deeply appreciate that so many of you repeatedly visit our website and other channels to constantly see what we\u2019ve been working on, often every day.
