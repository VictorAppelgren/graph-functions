For the past few years, the Disney Channel alum, 22, has been booked and busy, establishing herself as a household name through her work in Wednesday, the Scream franchise and more. Now, she wants to get behind the camera \u2014 and with the screenplay she\u2019s been workshopping for a decade, no less. While chatting with her Hurry Up Tomorrow costar and collaborator Abel Tesfaye (a.k.a. The Weeknd) for V magazine, Ortega revealed that she has been working on an original script for \u201calmost 10 years,\u201d and she has big plans for it. Jenna Ortega Shares Mom's 2010 Facebook Video That Launched Her Career: 'The Rest Is History' (Exclusive) \u201cI have a script that I\u2019ve known that I was going to make for almost 10 years,\u201d she said in the interview, published Monday, April 28. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because it\u2019s something that I thought of when I was younger and when I first started out in this field, and it\u2019s only now that I\u2019m actually starting to take the steps to get it made, which is really interesting.\u201d Jenna Ortega in 'Hurry Up Tomorrow'. Andrew Cooper/Lionsgate But the actress would not have done it any other way, she told Tesfaye, 35. The screenplay\u2019s decade-long incubation period, Ortega explained, was informed by her own experience in the industry in a valuable way. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that goes on behind the scenes that I wasn\u2019t aware of. I\u2019m just putting the puzzle pieces together in my head,\u201d the Death of a Unicorn star explained in the V chat. \u201cSo I think I needed a few years of that under my belt to understand the order of doing things.\u201d Jenna Ortega Admits She 'Could Have Used My Words Better' After Facing Controversy for Rewriting Her Wednesday Lines \"Everything that I\u2019ve done in my career, I feel like there\u2019s a reason why I didn\u2019t make this story at an earlier time, but I\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d the X star continued. \u201cI think learning how to produce and being a part of projects in that way has informed me so much.\u201d Now, the original screenplay \u2014 the content of which she did not share, or even hint at \u2014 is in the early stages of development, Ortega revealed. But she has a few other projects coming down the pike first. Jenna Ortega and The Weeknd in 'Hurry Up Tomorrow'. Andrew Cooper/Lionsgate \u201cThen there are a couple of other things I\u2019m trying to develop right now, but it\u2019s strictly off of being inspired by another actor or a writer, characters that I\u2019ve never really gotten the opportunity to play before,\u201d the Beetlejuice Beetlejuice star told Tesfaye. \u201cThey\u2019re very different preparation processes.\u201d \u201cSo for me,\u201d the actress continued, \u201cit\u2019s always fun to try something new. But I think oftentimes to get the stories that you want to get made nowadays, you kind of have to start them yourself.\u201d Jenna Ortega Responds to Miller's Girl Sex Scene Controversy: 'It's Not Supposed to Be a Comfortable Movie' And, after Tesfaye asked Ortega if she wants to star in the film, she revealed that more than anything, she wants to direct it. \u201cThis one in particular, I see myself in it, but I really want to direct,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the main thing that I want to do. I see that for myself. I just feel that\u2019s the way my brain wants to work and think, and that\u2019s how I even view my acting sometimes.\u201d Elsewhere in the chat, Ortega said she views acting as a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to what she really wants to do \u2014 direct, produce and all-around be behind the scenes.

(Ortega is also credited as an executive producer on the movie.) \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the things that I create in the future,\u201d she continued in the V chat, \u201cbut starting out, because I\u2019ve created more leverage for myself with a name as an actor, I may as well use that as a stepping stone.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.
