  "content": "SEATTLE, Aug 8 (Reuters) - One year after taking the helm during Boeing\u2019s (BA.N) deepest crisis in decades, CEO Kelly Ortberg has stopped the company's freefall. Now, he faces new challenges: ramping up jet production, reviving a struggling defense and space division, and restoring profitability at the storied planemaker.\n\nOrtberg was comfortably retired in Florida when Boeing\u2019s board offered him the top job at a company bleeding cash and reeling from reputational damage.\n\nThe crisis had deepened after a mid-air panel blowout on a new 737 MAX in January 2024, prompting his predecessor\u2019s exit and reviving memories of two fatal MAX crashes - in 2018 and 2019 - that killed 346 people.\n\nOrtberg arrived promising to restore trust, stay close to the factory floor, and ensure Boeing met its commitments to safety, quality, and transparency.\n\nSince then, Boeing has notched a string of wins: it has improved efficiency and quality on the 737 line, navigated President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies, reached a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to drop its prosecution over the crashes , signed blockbuster airplane deals, and landed the contract for the U.S.' first sixth-generation fighter, the F-47.\n\nIts stock is up 39% from a year ago, with the biggest gains coming in recent months as 737 output has risen.\n\nBut Boeing is still losing money, trailing Airbus (AIR.PA) in the single-aisle market, struggling to fix its space and defense programs, carrying heavy debt, acquiring its biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and falling behind on certifying its newest jets.\n\nOrtberg\u2019s immediate challenge is to ramp up production of the 737 MAX to pre-crisis levels and beyond - while positioning Boeing to eventually replace it with a new model.\n\n\"The biggest risk for Boeing looking forward is do they end up becoming a great company again or just a mediocre company?\" said Ron Epstein, Bank of America aerospace analyst.\n\nBoeing declined to make Ortberg available for an interview.\n\nAn Iowa native, Ortberg, 65, spent decades climbing the ranks at avionics firm Rockwell Collins, becoming CEO and steering it through a series of deals resulting in aerospace company RTX.\n\nKnown for his no-nonsense style, he retired in 2021.\n\nJans Timmers, who reported directly to Ortberg at Rockwell Collins, recalled Ortberg saying to him when dealing with a money-losing program: \"Put all the shit on the table and let's deal with it.\"\n\n\"And that's what he's doing at Boeing now,\" he added.\n\nWhen Ortberg arrived, Boeing - once celebrated for helping win World War Two and landing men on the moon - had become synonymous with cutting corners , prioritizing profits over production quality, and misleading regulators and customers.\n\nOrtberg shifted the focus to fixing the basics: reducing defects, eliminating out-of-sequence work, and improving overall build quality rather than simply pushing out more jets.\n\n\"Give a damn!\" became one of Boeing\u2019s new core values under Ortberg, introduced to employees in April.\n\nAlaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci credited Ortberg for being physically present on the factory floor in Seattle - where he chose to live, unlike predecessors.\n\n\"They\u2019re walking the floor, they\u2019re feeling what\u2019s going on,\u201d Minicucci said. \"That\u2019s different to what happened in the past.\"\n\nOrtberg faced one of the toughest challenges for any U.S. CEO this year: managing Donald Trump.\n\nThe U.S. president publicly slammed Boeing in February over delays and cost overruns on the Air Force One replacement program.\n\nDespite the tension, Trump joined Ortberg in May to celebrate a record widebody order from Qatar Airways. Behind the scenes, Ortberg and other aerospace leaders were working to manage Trump\u2019s volatile trade policies, which have largely spared the industry from new tariffs.\n\nOrtberg\u2019s most notable hire is Jeff Shockey , a seasoned aerospace political operative, brought in as Boeing\u2019s top lobbyist. Boeing needs Federal Aviation Administration support to boost production and certify new jets, as well as continued federal backing to develop the F-47 fighter, named after Trump as the 47th president.\n\n\"The idea of doing any of these without an experienced hand at the head of Boeing\u2019s Washington operations is inconceivable,\" AeroDynamic Advisory managing director Richard Aboulafia said.\n\nOrtberg has not had everything go his way. He struggled to end a strike last year by 33,000 union members who assemble Boeing's jetliners on the West Coast, which lasted seven weeks and deepened divides within the company.\n\nA separate group of 3,200 union workers who build fighter jets went on strike on Monday.\n\nThe company continues to lose money - $643 million through the first half of the year - and Ortberg has pushed back the long-delayed certifications of the 777-9 and the 737 MAX's smallest and largest variants, the MAX 7 and 10, to next year.\n\nOrtberg must now prepare Boeing to launch a new plane this decade that can retake market share lost to Airbus - or risk being relegated to also-ran for another decade or longer.\n\nOrtberg downplayed the stakes when asked about the year ahead during a recent earnings call.\n\n\"It's just one day at a time, improve our performance, address the issues that we have, restore trust and build confidence with our customer base and our end users of our products,\" he said.",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."
