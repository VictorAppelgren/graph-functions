  "description": "Are you interested in getting a Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, or Galaxy Watch Ultra? Hurry up, these deals may end soon!",
  "content": "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 may not be as fancy as the other new models, but it will meet most people\u2019s needs at a lower price. I happen to like the new design, too. It has adopted a more square bezel while keeping the circular screen. It looks much more like the Galaxy Watch Ultra lineup, but it is smaller and much sleeker \u2014 it\u2019s actually 11% thinner.\n\nWhile more petite, this smartwatch is actually quite resistant. It still comes with an IP68 rating, which makes it resistant to both water and dust. In fact, it also gets a 5ATM rating, which means you can submerge it as deep as 50 meters. On top of that, it even gets a MIL-STD-810H certification. You\u2019ll have a hard time damaging this little guy!\n\nAs you can see, this is a very capable smartwatch and very few of you would have any reason to upgrade. The free SmartTag 2 4-pack is really just a cherry on top. It\u2019s a $99.99 added value, so it\u2019s a nice deal if you\u2019ll actually take advantage of them.\n\nPersonally, the main benefit of upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the aesthetics. It looks much more like a traditional watch, instead of keeping that tech gadget look. This refined design will make it a better option for office-dwellers or anyone who cares about fashion.\n\nThe benefits don\u2019t end with aesthetics, though. You\u2019ll also get twice the storage, as it comes with 64GB. The frame is made of stainless steel, instead of aluminum, so it will be even sturdier. I also love that it has a rotating bezel, giving you a fun way to interact with the watch.\n\nOf course, it still has the same IP68, 5ATM, and MIL-STD-810H ratings, and the rest of the specs are also pretty much the same. If you deem the above-mentioned upgrades worthy, the free $100 gift card is definitely a nice incentive to upgrade.\n\nIf you want the best of the best, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra was refreshed in 2025. Its only main competitor is the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which is obviously for Apple users. This means that those who want a premium smartwatch experience on an Android phone have no better option than this one.\n\nHow is this different than the first Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra? Well, Samsung added a few improvements. For starters, it gets 64GB of storage, which is twice as much as the predecessor. There\u2019s also a really nice-looking Titanium Blue color version. It also comes with Wear OS 6 out of the box, in the form of Samsung\u2019s One UI 8 software.\n\nOtherwise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 model is pretty much the same, but this isn\u2019t a bad thing. It gets a large 1.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a 480 x 480 resolution and 3,000 nits of brightness. It\u2019s also more resistant. Aside from the same IP68 and MIL-STD-810H ratings, it also gets an improved 10ATM certification. This means it can be submerged as deep as 100 meters, which is twice as much as the other Galaxy Watch 8 series.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely pricey at $649, though. It\u2019s nice to at least get a free $100 gift card! Regardless of which smartwatch you\u2019re getting, we can only advise that you act quickly. These free gift offers don\u2019t usually last very long after the initial launch, and other similar offers on smartphones released at the same time have already disappeared. It\u2019s only a matter of time before these deals disappear, too.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nWaterproof tech: Everything you need to know about IP and ATM ratings\nMarch 7, 2025\nWaterproof tech has become a big trend in recent years. But how do you know how protected your device is? Most devices use either an IP or ATM ratings. Let\u2019s start by talking about what an IP rating is. Most high-end smartphones these days have an IP68 rating. These include the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Apple iPhone 16 series, and Google Pixel 9 series. Some can even go up to IP69, but that is rare. What does all of this even mean, though? Let\u2019s dig into it.\nWhat is an IP rating?\nYou probably know that IP ratings have something to do with protection from water and dust, but if you are reading this, that may be as far as your understanding goes.\nAn IP rating tells you the level of protection a device offers against solids and liquids. The International Electrotechnical Commission sets these standards. The \u201cIP\u201d stands for Ingress Protection (or International Protection) and is followed by two numbers. The first number indicates the level of protection against solid particles (dust, dirt, etc.) and ranges from one to six. The second number tells you how much water a device can handle without suffering damage, and it goes from one to nine \u2014 the higher the number, the better the protection against liquids. Check out the chart below for detailed info on what each number means:\n| Level | Solids (first number) | Liquids (second number) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Level 1 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 50mm (example: hands). | Liquids (second number) Protected against vertically falling drops of water. |\n| Level 2 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 12mm (example: fingers). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 15 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 3 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 2.5mm (example: tools and wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 60 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 4 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 1mm (example: small wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against water sprayed from all directions. |\n| Level 5 | Solids (first number) Dust protected \u2014 limited ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 6 | Solids (first number) Dust-tight \u2014 no ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against powerful jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 7 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of immersion in water \u2014 between 15 cm (5.9 inches) and 1 meter (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 8 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water under pressure. Usually 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of immersion for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 9 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against high pressure and temperature water jets. The device needs to survive 30 seconds of 14-16 liters directed at the phone from multiple angles, at an 80-degree Celsius temperature. |\nAs you can tell by the chart above, a handset with an IP67 rating is entirely dust-tight and will survive in up to one meter of water (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. An IP68-rated device is also completely dust-tight. It is protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water, which usually means it will survive in up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of water for 30 minutes. If a phone is IP69 rated, it means it can also handle really hot water under high pressure.\nIP69 ratings are still a bit rare in smartphones, but the list is growing. Some popular phones with an IP69 rating include the OnePlus 13, HONOR Magic 7 Pro, OPPO Find N5, and the Moto G Power 2025.\nYou\u2019ve probably also heard of an IP69K rating. This one isn\u2019t relevant to smartphones. IP69K ratings are provided to equipment made for road vehicles. It ensures that the rated product can withstand severe washes using pressure washers.\nWater-resistant, but not waterproof\nEven if a smartphone has a high IP rating, it may not be completely waterproof. You can drop a phone with an IP68 rating in a freshwater pond, or a tub, and it should be fine. However, if that phone is dipped in a chlorinated pool, or in the ocean, which has saltwater, that could cause problems.\nManufacturers are always quick to tell you water resistance is not a permanent state. The rubber seals and gaskets that usually protect a high IP-rated phone from water damage could be weakened over time. This could decrease the device\u2019s overall water resistance over time. Those same seals can erode if a smartphone encounters coffee, soft drinks, or champagne spills.\nRemember that a phone\u2019s IP rating is based on closed lab conditions, not real-world situations. In other words, try to keep your phone dry, even if it might have a high IP rating.\nAdditionally, a phone that has been damaged is likely no longer waterproof. Water can leak into the device through cracks.\nATM Rating\nThere\u2019s another rating to consider for devices, especially for smartwatches; the ATM (Atmospheres) rating system indicates how much static atmospheric pressure a device can deal with while in water. It\u2019s actually an older rating system than the IP certification. A rating of 1 ATM means that you are at sea level, outside of water. If a device has a 1 ATM level listed, don\u2019t put it in water under any circumstances.\nThe system is actually much simpler to understand. Each ATM number represents about 10 meters of depth. So, if you have a device with an ATM 3 rating, you should be able to submerge it as deep as 30 meters. An ATM 10 rating increases the depth to 100 meters, and so on. These are usually used in smartwatches and other more specialized tech.\nHere\u2019s a look at the ATM rating system.\n| Rating | Pressure | Device Meaning |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rating 1 ATM | Pressure 0. | Device Meaning Do not put in water. |\n| Rating 3 ATM | Pressure Under 100 feet. | Device Meaning Device can be used in the rain, and protected against splashes. |\n| Rating 5 ATM | Pressure Under 165 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for short amounts of time submerged in water, like swimming in a pool. |\n| Rating 10 ATM | Pressure Under 330 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for much longer amounts of time submerged in water, such as for snorkeling in the ocean. |\n| Rating 20 ATM | Pressure Under 660 feet. | Device Meaning Device can handle being used for high impact water sports like surfing and jet skiing. |\nMilitary ready standards\nYou may be wondering if there are any tougher handsets out there. Military certifications guarantee \u201ccombat-ready\u201d smartphones that can handle all kinds of damage. MIL-STD-810G-certified smartphones go through a series of 29 tests. These include exposure to shock, vibration, heat, cold, gunfire shock, humidity, and more. You can learn more about these in the link below. There\u2019s also the improved MIL-STD-810H now, which goes through 30 tests.\nThese MIL-STD ratings are usually reserved for rugged devices. Here\u2019s our list of the best rugged phones, if you want to take a look at some options.\nLooking after your devices\nAn IP or ATM rating gives you peace of mind if you pick up your device with wet hands, accidentally drop it in the pool, or use it in the rain. Without it, there is no reassurance a device will survive some liquid exposure.\nHowever, that does not mean your smartphone is invincible. Here are some quick tips to ensure you will get the most out of your smartphone:\n- If you decide to take your phone in the water, make sure to cover all the ports. Those may include SIM and microSD card slots. Your USB power port may also have a cover.\n- If you take your phone into a chlorinated pool, wash it off with fresh water when you take it out. Don\u2019t use soap or chemicals.\n- Your phone should stay away from saltwater, like the water found in the ocean.\n- Avoid using your phone in extreme locations, including places with high heat, like a sauna, or rough environments.\n- If your phone goes into the water, dry it off thoroughly before plugging other accessories into their ports. That includes your USB phone charger or wired headphones if the phone has a headphone jack. Also, don\u2019t use a hairdryer to dry off your phone; use a dry cloth.\n- Remove any hair or other small objects that you might see inside your phone\u2019s covers and ports. Even small amounts of dirt could damage your microSD card slot, USB power ports, or headphone jack.\n- One last recommendation we can give you is to always have smartphone insurance. You never know when something can go wrong. Also, read your insurance\u2019s terms, as some might not cover water damage, especially when caused by willful actions.\nConsider getting a waterproof pouch\nIf you must take your phone underwater, we recommend investing in a second layer of protection. Waterproof pouches are a great way to keep your expensive electronics safe when submerged in liquids. Here\u2019s a really good one from CaliCase.\nFAQs\nIP ratings are standards that measure how much a product can withstand solids and liquids. It stands for Ingress Protection, and two numbers follow it. The first measures how much the unit can handle solids, while the second number measures liquid resistance.\nThe best smartphones usually come with an IP68 rating. This makes them dust-tight and protected against immersion up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. Some rugged devices take it a step further and also get IP69 certification, which means they can withstand pressured hot water.\nSmartphones don\u2019t usually come with ATM ratings. These ratings are reserved for watches and other products you might take to deeper depths.\nThe most resistant rugged devices come with a MIL-STD rating. Usually MIL-STD-810H, but some devices still have the older MIL-STD-810G rating. These devices go through a wide variety of tests, and can generally handle more damage, such as shock, high pressures, extreme temperatures, and more.\nSome phones don\u2019t have excellent IP ratings. This means it might be unsafe to get them in contact with water. That said, you can always get a waterproof phone pouch and add a layer of protection to any device.\nSay the worst has already happened, and you\u2019ve already water-damaged your smartphone. We have a guide for fixing water-damaged phones. Just keep in mind none of these methods are guaranteed to work. You might need a new phone.

Learn more.\nI've tested smartwatches for Android and iPhone for years: These are the only picks I'd buy in 2025\nApril 22, 2025\nSmartwatches are no longer a novelty. I see more wrists strapped into wearables than analog timepieces on a daily basis. Yet, a growing market only means more room for competition and a more confusing shopping experience. After testing countless smartwatches over the years, I\u2019ve honed in on what makes a device the most valuable, including user experience, feature set, fitness tracking tools, and sensor package, without forgetting about comfort and looks. Depending on what ecosystem you belong to, the watches below represent the top smartwatches I recommend.\nGoogle Pixel Watch 3: The best smartwatch for Android users\n- Larger, secondary case size\n- Multi-day battery life\n- Added wellness features, including advanced running metrics\n- Refined integration with Pixel phones and Google services\n- Accurate heart rate tracking\n- Runs Wear OS 5\n- GPS unimproved from Pixel Watch 2\n- Inconsistent total distances\n- Higher price than GW7 (but worth it)\nWhen Google officially entered the smartwatch race, the company had a bit of a jerky start. The first generation introduced an attractive look but fell painfully short in other areas, especially battery life. The second generation cleaned up some of the line\u2019s early issues but still didn\u2019t offer an experience quite as refined as other brands. Fortunately, the company\u2019s growing pains seem to be behind them, as the Google Pixel Watch 3 proves a fantastic device worthy of being called the best Wear OS smartwatch available.\nLaunched with Google\u2019s latest software on board, the Pixel Watch 3 offers a pure and powerful Wear OS 5 experience, including upgraded integration with Pixel phones and other Google products and services. Thanks to built-in Fitbit health and fitness tracking tools, the watch also features a robust wellness platform. I found the GPS a little shaky during some workouts, but the heart rate accuracy is genuinely staggering.\nWhat\u2019s more, Google also introduced a second case size, offering a better fit for more wrists. Both models retain the same minimalist design users fell in love with but now feature better display specs, shrunken bezels, and better battery life. For the first time, the Pixel Watch 3 is a true multi-day device.\nApple Watch Series 10: The best smartwatch for iPhone users\n- Increased display size\n- Thinner, sleeker build\n- FDA-approved sleep apnea detection\n- Useful watchOS 11 updates and additions\n- Faster charging\n- Same 18-24 hour battery life\n- No SpO2 measurements disabled in US\n- Vitals app somewhat simplified\nIt\u2019s genuinely hard to beat an Apple Watch if you\u2019re a shopper within Apple\u2019s ecosystem. The lineup features unmatched third-party app support and seamless integration with iPhones. My device is loaded with everything from Spotify to Audible, and it\u2019s where I field 90% of my notifications and review 100% of my wellness stats most days. Though somewhat stagnant, the company\u2019s well-known aesthetic is also clean and elegant, especially if you prefer a square display to fit more text. Meanwhile, watchOS improves year after year, delivering a more powerful experience to users\u2019 wrists.\nLike its predecessors, the newest Apple Watch Series 10 offers a dynamic, feature-packed smartwatch experience. Starting with its build, the series is available in two increased case sizes that are both thinner and sleeker. The lineup also features the largest usable display area yet on any Apple Watch, and the on-wrist look and feel is quite elevated. Though we didn\u2019t see any improvement to battery specs, the watches charge remarkably fast, powering up from zero to 55% in just twenty minutes during my review.\nFor fitness tracking, the Series 10 packs a bevy of sensors, including a depth gauge for snorkeling, a heart rate sensor that can keep up with a dedicated chest strap, and GPS tracking that matches routes recorded by much higher-end GPS watches. In other words, I\u2019ve found the Series 10 a highly reliable workout companion. Thanks to watchOS 11, users will find more advanced training tools and an upgraded workout app for recording even more stats. The watch also tracks everything from sleep to stress and will even detect signs of sleep apnea.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: The best smartwatch for Samsung phone users\n- Useful new Energy Score\n- Sleek, refined design\n- Familiar Wear OS experience\n- Easily interchangeable watch bands\n- Reasonable price\n- More accurate heart rate monitor\n- Some Samsung-exclusive features\n- GPS tracking still struggles with tall buildings\n- Still mostly minor updates\n- Battery life is good but not great\nSamsung\u2019s stable remains the best place to shop if you\u2019re a Samsung phone user, and the Galaxy Watch 7 continues the company\u2019s trend of launching successful Wear OS devices year after year. The smartwatch offers a familiar software experience, with Wear OS 5 running under Samsung\u2019s One UI 6 Watch overlay, plus a whole layer of powerful Galaxy AI-powered metrics and tools, like Energy Score, Race Partner, and sleep apnea detection.\nI was especially excited to see that heart rate monitoring improved on the newest model. Of course, if you want a larger, more rugged build with better battery life and accurate GPS tracking, Samsung also launched the Galaxy Watch Ultra ($649.99 at Amazon) at a much higher price point.\nGarmin Venu 3: The best smartwatch for detailed fitness tracking\n- Highly accurate GPS and heart rate sensors\n- Automatic nap detection and sleep coaching\n- On-device phone call and voice assistant support\n- Up to 14-day battery life\n- Larger display\n- Pricey compared to competitors\n- No LTE model\n- Limited third-party app support\nThe Garmin Venu 3 is easily one of the best Garmin watches you can buy and the best pick for anyone in need of a more fitness-focused wearable. The dual-sized lineup boasts top-tier multi-GNSS, and I found that the GPS tracking on the Venu 3 is incredibly accurate, especially for a smartwatch rather than a dedicated GPS wearable. If you\u2019re a runner or cyclist, this is a huge highlight. On the heart rate monitoring front, the Venu 3 features an Elevate V5 optical heart rate sensor, which I found highly reliable, and the sensor is even certified to provide ECG readings. It also has training tools like Recovery Time, Workout Benefit, and Perceived Exertion. As for smartwatch features, the device is a bit leaner than others on this list. It offers phone call support and voice assistant compatibility when a paired phone is nearby, music storage, and an onscreen flashlight feature.\nOnePlus Watch 3: The best smartwatch for battery life\n- Fantastic battery life\n- Powerful Wear OS 5 platform\n- Functional rotating crown\n- Spacious, colorful display\n- Bulky single case size\n- Some features unavailable at launch\n- Imperfect heart rate and GPS data\n- No LTE model (yet)\nAnother solid option from the Wear OS family worth considering, the OnePlus Watch 3 features dual-chip architecture, housing the Snap W5 running Wear OS 5 plus a second \u201cefficiency chipset\u201d for running RTOS. This creates a dynamic user experience with distinctive use modes for extreme battery savings. In smartwatch mode, the watch lasts up to 5 days between charges. In Power saver mode, Wear OS disappears from the user experience, stretching battery life for days more while still offering basic smart features and wellness tracking functions. During my review, I found the software experience smooth and the device responsive in both modes. It is, however, only available in one 47mm case size, which may be too large for some wrists.\nMobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro: The best smartwatch for a unique, battery-saving display\n- Dual display is fantastic\n- Updated digital crown\n- Improved durability\n- Same snappy performance\n- Doesn\u2019t run the latest Wear OS\n- No wireless charging\n- Only available in one size\n- No LTE model\nMobvoi\u2019s TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro is one of my favorite devices for a truly unique dual-display that facilitates excellent battery life. The watch is also durably built with Sapphire glass and a functional rotating crown for smooth navigation. Its GPS performed well during my review period, and I am a big fan of the color-coded heart rate zones for fine-tuned training. However, my hesitation in recommending this watch is that it still runs an older Wear OS, while other companies stretch the gap with newer, more powerful software. I would love to see a rollout schedule to feel confident that the device will eventually see a Wear OS 5 update.\nWithings ScanWatch 2: The best hybrid smartwatch\n- Premium, classy design\n- Up to 30-day battery life\n- Broad health tracking tools\n- Useful fitness tracking\n- Available in two sizes\n- Limited display space\n- High price point\n- No built-in GPS\n- Few smart features\nThe Withings ScanWatch 2 is my specialty pick, with a classy, analog form factor and undercover advanced health tracking. The device offers a medical-grade ECG monitor, pulse oximeter, and 24/7 heart rate monitoring. It will notify you of warning signs of bradycardia and tachycardia and provide ECG readings on demand. It also boasts sensors for measuring skin and ambient temperatures, plus overnight blood oxygen monitoring and respiratory scans for detecting warning signs of sleep apnea. It\u2019s proved a highly reliable sleep tracker through my review period and offers the longest-lasting battery life of any device in this list. Personally, I also love the addition of detailed female health tracking on-device, plus automatic workout detection for more than 40 activities.\nGarmin Fenix 8 AMOLED: The best ultra-premium smartwatch\n- Bright built-in flashlight\n- Excellent battery life\n- Accurate activity tracking\n- Three case sizes\n- Punchy speaker\n- Sharp AMOLED face\n- Proprietary charging cable\n- Titanium costs extra\n- Bulky on smaller wrists\n- Very expensive\nThe Venu 3 is great, but the Fenix 8 AMOLED is the absolute best Garmin watch and the best ultra-premium smartwatch that money can buy. Its three case sizes (41mm, 47mm, and 51mm) make it so that there\u2019s a Fenix for almost every wrist, and the new microphone and speaker mean you don\u2019t need another smartwatch for your everyday life. In fact, Garmin\u2019s new support for voice assistants means that the Fenix 8 AMOLED is better able to compete with Ultra-branded wearables from Apple and Samsung, yet offers significantly better battery life than either one with up to 16 days from the 47mm model. The Fenix 8 AMOLED isn\u2019t just a pretty face, either, combining the reliable Elevate V5 heart rate sensor with an impressive set of workout tools like Training Readiness, Body Battery, and more activity types than I\u2019ve managed to use in my month with the watch. Although the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED might be a bit too rugged for some casual wearers (and cost a bit more than most will want to pay), you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a watch with more adventure behind its crisp, vibrant display.\nWhat to look for in a good smartwatch\nKnowing where to start is not easy if you\u2019re shopping for your first smartwatch. Software experience and compatibility are crucial, but don\u2019t always narrow the field enough. You\u2019ll also want to determine what your priorities are in terms of features and specs. Do you want an extension of your phone, or are you interested in tracking intense workouts or advanced health stats? Does daily charging sound cumbersome? The topics below are all points I think are worth considering before you commit to any of the smartwatches I\u2019ve recommended in this guide, or generally on the wider market:\n- Is it compatible with your phone (Android or iOS)?\n- Does it run the latest software version?\n- Is the brand renowned for good update consistency?\n- What is your budget?\n- Does the smartwatch have first- and third-party app support?\n- How good is the battery life?\n- Does it cater to your fitness tracking needs?\n- Does it have onboard or connected GPS (preferably the former)?\n- How accurate is the heart rate tracking?\n- Does it have SpO2 monitoring?\n- Does it have accurate sleep tracking?\n- Can it take on-wrist phone calls?\n- Is there a voice assistant for hands-free use?\n- How does it handle notifications?\n- Does it have digital payment support?\n- How useful is the companion app (and does it have one at all)?\n- Is the fit comfortable?\n- Does the look match your aesthetic?\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019ve been professionally testing and reviewing wearables for years, dating back to before Samsung teamed up with Google for the Wear OS we now know and love, and long before Apple launched its first-generation, massive Ultra. I\u2019ve reviewed dozens of smartwatches, fitness trackers, dedicated heart rate monitors, smart rings, sleep trackers, exercise equipment, and health and fitness apps and platforms. In other words, I\u2019ve sweated my way through a ton of products to learn what makes them valuable and what features matter most.\nI've been professionally testing and reviewing wearables for more than four years.\nAt the start of every review, my focus is twofold: user experience and value. First, I approach each product as a typical user, noting everything from comfort and design to performance and features. I fire off texts, download apps, and tap into everything from timers to gesture controls. To dig even deeper, I bring expertise and comparable metrics to the conversation, using tools like heart rate monitors, pedometers, pulse oximeters, and trusted sleep trackers and GPS devices. I create varied workout plans to test fitness tracking accuracy and closely monitor my stress and sleep to review recovery metrics. Above all, I wear the device consistently to garner a thorough understanding of what it offers and what it\u2019s like to own. I also simultaneously use competitors\u2019 products to compare differences and collect comparative data.\nWhat is your favorite smartwatch brand right now\nWhen all that is done, I sit down with the wearable and all the details I\u2019ve collected to evaluate its value. This means establishing its place in the larger market and determining whether its price is fair for what it offers. If a product boasts a large feature set but doesn\u2019t deliver accuracy, it may not be worth its price. Conversely, if a wearable successfully executes more tools than competitors of equal price, I rate it higher.\nTypically, my review period lasts at least a week, giving me time to explore the product fully. For some launches, this process can extend to weeks or months. I also revisit the devices I test regularly to check in on software updates and feature drops and to make sure my original findings stand the test of time.\nThank you for being part of our community.
