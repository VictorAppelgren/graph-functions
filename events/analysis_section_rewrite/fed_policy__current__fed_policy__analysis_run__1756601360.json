      "feedback": "The draft mixes sourced facts with many unsourced quantitative claims and vague “what‑if” scenarios. Remove or re‑phrase every statement that lacks a source ID: the 4.20‑4.30 % band, 4.25 % support, 4.35‑4.40 % rebound, 4.10‑4.15 % slide, the “surprise uptick core PCE > 2.9 %” and “Fed statements” clauses, and the 5‑10 bp tariff‑impact estimate. Keep only the core PCE 2.6 % (U21K4ALYQ), Fed‑funds futures 85 % (U21K4ALYQ), and tariff announcement on Aug 29 (3952FOSRQ) as the basis for the causal chain: core PCE → Fed rate‑cut expectation → term premium → UST10Y; tariff announcement → risk premium + trade‑growth signal → UST10Y. Explicitly state the catalyst window (Aug 29 core PCE release and tariff announcement, with market reaction in the next 3‑5 trading days). If you wish to keep a yield range, label it as a projection and cite a relevant source or drop it entirely. Trim the paragraph to 3–4 concise sentences that focus on UST10Y, include the required citations, and keep the narrative tight and actionable.",
