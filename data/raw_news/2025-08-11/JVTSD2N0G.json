  "title": "Council overruled on 5G phone tower in Whitmore Reans",
  "description": "The 20m tower can go ahead after the intervention of a government inspector.",
  "content": "The City of Wolverhampton Council has been overruled on a move to stop a 5G tower from being built in front of a planned new housing estate. The authority refused a plan to install a 20m (65ft) 5G tower in Craddock Street, Whitmore Reans, because it would be \"to the detriment\" of future residents. But despite admitting the tower would \"harm the character\" of the area, a government planning inspector has allowed the work to go ahead. Its \"social and economical benefits\" outweighed any visual flaws, the inspector said, adding they disagreed with the council in that the tower was not \"unduly incongruous or overbearing\" and would not be an \"untypical\" feature of the street.\n\nThe plans by Cornerstone Telecommunications had asked for permission to install the tower and equipment opposite Gill's Bar and Banqueting, the former Pegasus pub, and the old Grasshoppers building which was destroyed by a huge fire in 2021. The now empty site has appeared in the council's housing plans since the early 90s and was included in various development plans and housing documents without action \u2013 and most recently appeared as a potential site for up to 48 new homes. Rejecting the tower in 2024 the council also stated: \"The size and appearance of the monopole and equipment cabinets would create visual clutter and introduce an overly prominent, incongruous and alien feature to the street-scene.\" But the planning inspector said alongside their decision, while \"the proposed monopole would exceed that of other structures, it would be located along an urban street where other utilitarian structures are visible, and in front of a rather stark and functional palisade fence\". \"Due to its conspicuous height and functional appearance the siting and appearance of the proposal would cause harm to the character and appearance of the area. \"However, given the surrounding context of a busy urban street scape and commercial development, the scale of this harm would be limited.\"",

It\u2019s like a franchise: different companies with different approaches, but using common editorial standards and all publishing into the same system.\n- The core purpose of the LDRS is to provide impartial coverage of the regular business and workings of local authorities in the UK, and other relevant democratic institutions such as mayoralties, combined authority areas, P&CCs, quangos, etc.\n- The Local Democracy Reporters' (LDRs) brief is to report on the decision-making process: what decisions are made in the public's name and how they are arrived at, what evidence is presented to the council, etc.\n- The expectation is that LDRs shall endeavour to attend all meetings in person.\n- In two-tier council areas the LDRs should cover district council affairs sufficiently to ensure that significant decisions (eg planning) are reported.\n- LDRs may provide other stories which are focused on local democracy and which are in the public interest so long as that does not detract from the core purpose of the service.\n- All their work must be available to all qualifying partners.\n- National politics is out of scope, but election campaigns and constituency work of MPs, AMs, MSPs and MLAs that specifically relates to relevant local audiences may be covered so long as it does not detract from the core purpose of the LDRS.\nLDRs report to the contract holder, not to the BBC or any other partner.\nWith the guidance and support of the contract holder, LDRs work to the brief covering the stories of greatest public interest and they should not undertake commissions for any partner.\nDirect questions and clarifications relating to content are acceptable, but any suggestions or comments relating to the service should go through a LDR's manager.\nThe only difference between the BBC and others is that it has a right to request interviews or 2-ways for BBC Local Radio. Depending on workload and commitments it is up to each LDR to decide whether or not to agree.\nNo. While meeting the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality, written content may conform to an employer's normal style. BBC training will help create a common standard for media content production.\n- All content must be created for all qualifying partners.\n- Content should be published as soon as possible after a meeting or event.\n- All content must be published using the LDRS Authoring Tool so all partners see it simultaneously.\n- All content must be titled COUNCIL NAME: Story Name.\n- It must be tagged with at least one top-tier local authority, but can have as many tags as are relevant.\n- Images and media must have a descriptive label.\n- Images and media must be rights-free (LDRs should not use their employer\u2019s picture library, or images supplied by agencies or freelance contributors).\n- LDRs should, where possible, assign a \"Feature Image\" to a story.\n- LDRs must provide an Advisory note in the publishing system before the end of every week indicating their diary for the next seven days (or longer).\n- LDRs should source their content. An explanatory Note to Editors at the end of a story regarding the source will reduce queries from partners, especially around whether qualified privilege applies to all or part of a story.\n- LDRs should not file a story based on a press release already in the public domain unless it has been significantly developed with new quotes or information.\n- Embargoed content must explain why publication should be delayed.\n- Posts should be via LDRs' personal accounts rather than contractors' branded accounts.\n- LDRs are encouraged to post an Advisory in the LDRS Authoring Tool to let partners know if they intend live-Tweeting from a meeting, for example.\n- Tagging #LDReporter will help the partnership collate relevant tweets.\n- LDRs should be credited as \"First Name, Last Name, Local Democracy Reporter\".\n- By-lines or references within copy are acceptable.\n- Broadcasters should acknowledge LDRs when they appear on air or when the format allows.\n- Shared credit with other reporters is acceptable if LDRs' content is copied, edited or incorporated into new pieces of work.\n- The LDRS logo can also be used in print, online or on TV, but is not compulsory.\n- LDRs should refer to themselves as \"Local Democracy Reporters\", not \"BBC Local Democracy Reporters\" in all forms of communication, including social media profiles.\n- Corrections and clarifications relating to previously published stories must be clearly highlighted and issued immediately.\n- The headline style should be as follows: 'COUNCIL NAME: Story Name - CORRECTION'.\n- The first paragraph of the body copy should be as follows: 'CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that\u2026'."
