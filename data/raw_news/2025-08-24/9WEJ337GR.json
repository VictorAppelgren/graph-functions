  "content": "Over the past two years, I have started seeing him around town, at the grocery store, at church. He stares at me in a way that makes me deeply uncomfortable. AP\n\nDear Annie: I need advice on how to deal with a former fianc\u00e9. We dated for nearly a year before getting engaged, but the engagement lasted only a few months. Once we were engaged, he began laying down expectations for our future: dinner on the table at 5, how many children we would have, even which promotions I should turn down at work. I am a health professional with two graduate degrees, and our outlooks on life could not have been more different. I ended the engagement.\n\nAt the time, he told me I would regret it. I never have, not for a single moment. I have been happily married for over 30 years.\n\nHe eventually married as well, but I recently learned his wife passed away six years ago. Over the past two years, I have started seeing him around town, at the grocery store, at church. He stares at me in a way that makes me deeply uncomfortable. When we cross paths, I say a polite hello and move on, but he deliberately walks in front of me or lingers nearby so I will notice him. I have no interest in reconnecting.\n\nHe is 67, and I am 70. I know he has family two hours away where his parents and wife are buried. I cannot help but feel unsettled by his presence. I want to make it clear that this is over and there is nothing to discuss.\n\nHow can I send that message firmly but respectfully? -- It Is Over\n\nDear Over: You have every right to feel unsettled. Your former fianc\u00e9 may be lonely or nostalgic, but that does not give him permission to make you uncomfortable.\n\nYou ended that relationship decades ago and moved on with your life. A simple hello is more than enough. You do not owe him conversation, closure or curiosity.\n\nIf his presence begins to feel intrusive or persistent, you have a few options. Keep your distance when possible, and if he tries to approach you directly, look him in the eye and say, \u201cPlease respect my space. I have no interest in reconnecting.\u201d You do not need to explain or justify yourself.\n\nShould the behavior escalate or continue, do not hesitate to speak with a pastor, store manager or even law enforcement. Being polite does not mean tolerating discomfort.\n\nThis chapter closed a long time ago. It is perfectly fine to keep it that way.\n\n\u201cHow Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?\u201d is out now! Annie Lane\u2019s second anthology -- featuring favorite columns on marriage, infidelity, communication and reconciliation -- is available as a paperback and e-book.

For the most part, things are good. But lately, something\u2019s been bothering me.\nMark has a weekly \u201cguys\u2019 night\u201d every Thursday with his two best friends from college. It used to be every other week, but now it\u2019s weekly, and sometimes even more often. I\u2019ve asked if I could come by to say a quick hello or drop something off, and he always says not to -- it\u2019s their \u201ctradition.\u201d\nLast Thursday, I found a receipt in the laundry from a wine bar downtown. He told me they were at Jake\u2019s house playing cards. When I asked about the receipt, he brushed it off and said they stopped there first, which he \u201cforgot\u201d to mention.\nI haven\u2019t seen anything else suspicious, but it\u2019s starting to feel like I\u2019m being excluded on purpose. Am I overreacting, or should I trust my gut? -- Future Mrs. or Fool?\nDear Future Mrs. or Fool: These don\u2019t scream red flags -- maybe orange -- but it\u2019s smart to trust your instincts. Mark is allowed time with his friends, but it shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of your peace of mind. If you haven\u2019t already, you need to tell him how this is affecting you.\nKeep your tone curious, not accusatory. Try something like, \u201cI felt a little left out after Thursday night. I know it\u2019s your guys\u2019 time, but I\u2019ve been feeling uneasy and just wanted to talk about it.\u201d That kind of approach invites honesty without putting him on the defensive.\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be about spying or catching him in a lie; it\u2019s about feeling connected. A good partner won\u2019t dismiss that. And who knows? A little nudge might even open the door to a better understanding of what guys\u2019 night is all about.\nRead other recent Dear Annie columns\n- Dear Annie: Our son graduated college two years ago and still hasn\u2019t found a job\n- Dear Annie: My husband is finally getting the care he needs, but his family blames me for the distance between them\n- Dear Annie: My best friend has had no time for me since she started dating\n- Dear Annie: My sister has worn out her welcome.

      "text": "Dear Annie: My sister, \u201cLaura,\u201d recently moved back to town after her divorce and has been staying with me and my husband \u201cjust for a month\u201d while she looks for a new apartment. That was in April. It\u2019s now August, and she\u2019s made no effort to move out.\nShe\u2019s sweet with our kids and helps out here and there, but she also leaves dishes in the sink, uses my clothes without asking and has basically turned our guest room into her full-time space. Last week, I overheard her on the phone telling someone she\u2019s \u201cstaying with family indefinitely.\u201d\nMy husband is starting to lose patience, and honestly, so am I. But every time I try to bring up a timeline for her leaving, she gets teary and says she\u2019s \u201ctrying\u201d and just needs more time. I want to be supportive -- she went through a rough breakup -- but I\u2019m starting to feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of our kindness.\nHow do I set a boundary without sounding cold? I love my sister, but I also want my home (and my closet) back. -- Overdue Houseguest\nDear Overdue: Sounds like your sister is lonely, heartbroken and, yes, taking advantage of your generosity. You can be supportive without letting her steamroll your life and your home. If you don\u2019t speak up, you\u2019ll only grow more resentful -- which will be tougher on everybody.\nHave a calm conversation with her. Be honest, not harsh. Try something like, \u201cI know this has been a tough season for you, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve been able to help. But we need our space back, and I\u2019d like us to figure out a move-out plan together.\u201d\nBeing clear doesn\u2019t make you unkind.

      "text": "Dear Annie: My 23-year-old son graduated from college two years ago and has been unemployed ever since. He earned a degree in a competitive field but has not had any luck landing a job in his chosen profession. While we understand that finding the right opportunity can take time, we are growing increasingly concerned.\nHe refuses to consider any kind of job outside of his intended career path, insisting that if he takes something \u201cbeneath him,\u201d he will get stuck and never leave. We have tried reasoning with him, encouraging him to gain experience, even if it is unrelated, to avoid having a completely blank resume. We have offered suggestions, networking opportunities and moral support, but he will not budge.\nHe still lives at home, which we do not mind, within reason, but the money he saved while working part time in college is running out fast. It is frustrating to watch him stagnate while the months go by. He says he is waiting for the \u201cright fit,\u201d but we worry he is letting pride or fear hold him back.\nHow do we help him see that some kind of work, any work, is better than no work at all? And how do we support him without enabling this pattern? I admire your insight and would truly appreciate any words of wisdom for both him and us. -- Worried Parents in Limbo\nDear Worried: You are right to be concerned. A two-year gap on a resume, especially in those early post-grad years, can be hard to explain later. While it is admirable that your son wants to pursue work in his chosen field, his refusal to take any job in the meantime is shortsighted and, frankly, self-sabotaging.\nWork is more than a title. It teaches discipline, builds character and often leads to unexpected opportunities. No one\u2019s first job out of college defines their entire future. What does shape the future is sitting at home waiting for perfection. That is not strategy; it is fear wearing a mask of pride.\nLet your son know that while you love him, the time for passivity has passed. He needs to contribute, either by working, volunteering, interning or even pursuing additional training. And if his savings are dwindling, it may be time to start charging rent -- not as punishment, but to nudge him toward reality.\nSometimes, the most loving thing a parent can do is stop cushioning the fall.\nRead other recent Dear Annie columns\n- Dear Annie: My husband is finally getting the care he needs, but his family blames me for the distance between them\n- Dear Annie: My best friend has had no time for me since she started dating\n- Dear Annie: My sister has worn out her welcome.

      "text": "Dear Annie: I met my husband three years ago, about eight months after he lost his first wife of 20 years. Their marriage was often toxic, and she was very abusive toward him. After she passed, he was ready to move on.\nRight away, I knew something wasn\u2019t right with my husband. In his mid-50s, he was having short-term memory issues, falling frequently and struggling with his mental health. After seeing his health care provider and enrolling in the Veterans Affairs health care system, we discovered he had suffered multiple traumatic brain injuries during his time in the Army. That diagnosis led to him becoming a 100% service-connected disabled veteran and allowed him to receive the care he needed for a better quality of life.\nHis family, however, waged a war against me for helping him, accusing me of manipulating and \u201cbrainwashing\u201d him. My husband has distanced himself from them, and we\u2019re no longer on speaking terms. My husband has a lot of anger toward them as he suffered for decades without their help or support.\nHis parents, who live in another state, are elderly and in poor health. I fear that if he doesn\u2019t reconcile with them before they pass, he will resent me. I love my husband with all my heart, and this has been a hard road. I just want the very best for him, unconditionally. Any advice? -- Wife on the Defensive\nDear Wife on the Defensive: You\u2019ve been an incredible source of support for your husband. You recognized he was suffering and helped him get the care he so clearly needed. That\u2019s not brainwashing; that\u2019s being a spouse through good and bad, in sickness and in health.\nIt\u2019s understandable to worry he might one day regret cutting ties with his parents, but reconciliation isn\u2019t something you can or should force. That decision is up to your husband. If he ever expresses interest in reaching out to them again, support him gently. If not, trust that he\u2019s made peace with that choice and knows what\u2019s best for him, even if it\u2019s painful.\nRead other recent Dear Annie columns\n- Dear Annie: Our son graduated college two years ago and still hasn\u2019t found a job\n- Dear Annie: My best friend has had no time for me since she started dating\n- Dear Annie: My sister has worn out her welcome.
