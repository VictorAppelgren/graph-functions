  "content": "Temperatures in the UK are set to soar to 34C in some places as the nation braces for its fourth heatwave of the summer.\n\nAuthorities have warned that there could be a rise in deaths as amber and yellow health alerts come into effect at 9am on Tuesday.\n\nThe hot and dry conditions have prompted officials to warn England is suffering from \u201cnationally significant\u201d water shortfalls despite rain in July, as fires were seen in areas of east London on Monday.\n\nSouthern areas including Berkshire, Oxfordshire and outskirts of London such as Heathrow may reach 34C on Tuesday as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) set heat health warnings for all of England.\n\nThe East Midlands, West Midlands, east of England, London and the south east, which are all under more severe amber alerts, have been warned there could be a rise in deaths particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions.\n\nHowever, the UKHSA added that there may also be impacts on younger age groups, with a likely increase in demand for health and social care services.\n\nOn Monday, officials warned that England is suffering from \u201cnationally significant\u201d water shortfalls despite rain in July.\n\nThe national drought group \u2013 which includes the Met Office, regulators, government, water companies and other organisations \u2013 has met as five areas of the country remain in drought, with six more in prolonged dry weather status.\n\nEngland is seeing widespread environmental and agricultural impacts from the lack of water, which is hitting crop yields, reducing feed for livestock, damaging wetlands and river wildlife, and increasing wildfires, the group said.\n\nExperts warn climate change is driving more extreme weather conditions in the UK, worsening drought and dry spells, and making heatwaves more frequent and severe.\n\nWednesday could bring 33C to 34C heat to eastern England including Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire and East Anglia, and Thursday may see 29C to 30C in London and East Anglia.\n\nSeasonal averages are generally between 18C and 22C in Britain, and go up to 23C for London.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said on Monday that the UK is on day two of the heatwave and there is \u201coverall a very hot, very warm week to come\u201d.\n\nThe Met Office defines a heatwave as temperatures meeting or exceeding a certain threshold for three consecutive days or more.\n\nThis is 25C for most of the UK, but rises to 28C in London and its surrounding area, where temperatures are typically higher.\n\nLower pressure to the west and higher pressure to the east of the country is creating a southerly airflow which is drawing in hot and humid air from Europe, he added.\n\nThe near continent is experiencing high temperatures with France reaching the low 40Cs on Monday.\n\n\u201cAs we go through the week, there\u2019s lots of sunshine and the air isn\u2019t really going anywhere \u2026 that sort of then hangs around,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s drawing in at the moment and then sort of stays across the UK for the rest of the week.\u201d\n\nWales may see its hottest day of the year on Tuesday but temperatures are not expected to break 2025 records in other parts of the UK. England\u2019s high for 2025 stands at 35.8C recorded in Faversham, Kent, on July 1.",

      "text": "Major incident declared as huge fire rages on Dorset heath\nAround 100 firefighters were called out on Saturday evening to tackle the large blaze\nA major incident has been declared after 100 firefighters were called out to tackle a huge blaze raging on Dorset heathland.\nThe wildfire, which prompted 20 homes to be evacuated, measured around 1,000 metres by 800 metres on Saturday evening, with fire crews working through the night and into Sunday to contain the blaze.\nThe fire at Holt Heath, near Wimborne, spread rapidly due to windy conditions fanning the flames. All those who fled their homes on Saturday evening have now returned but residents have been advised to keep their doors and windows closed due to the dense smoke billowing from the site.\nOn Sunday morning, the fire service said that steady progress had been made through the night to suppress the spread of the fire - with around 69 hectares of land affected.\nSeven pumps were still being used to spray water onto the blaze on Sunday morning, with the National Trust also helping the fire service create fire breaks. By 4pm, firefighters were still tackling the fire and road closures were still in place.\nA second heath fire, which affected 21 hectares of land at Newton Heath near Swanage, is also still burning. Firefighters have been tackling that blaze since last Sunday.\nAssistant Chief Fire Officer Darren Langdown said on Saturday: \u201cWe have declared a major incident both due to the size of the fire at Holt Heath, and also the impact of this and Newton Heath on our overall availability of resources.\n\u201cWe are extremely grateful to our neighbouring services for the support they are giving us, and I can only praise all of our staff who are working so hard in extremely arduous conditions to bring these fires under control.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI would ask the public to help us by staying away from the affected areas; the fire at Holt Heath, in particular, is spreading rapidly and anyone trying to see what\u2019s going on could be cut off very easily. We would also ask photographers not to fly drones near the fire, as we are using drones provided by Wessex Rescue to help us direct our firefighting.\u201d\nOne dog walker Marcus Lastra, from Ringwood, recounted his horror at coming across the huge blaze.\nHe told Bournemouth Echo that he was walking his dog near Holt Heath when he noticed smoke rising in the distance. He said it had soon grown into a huge fire, describing the experience as \u201ca dog walk turns into a horror movie\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cBecause it\u2019s an open area, the flames spread very quickly in the wind. In those few moments before the fire brigade got there, it had really take hold.\n\u201cThey started spraying parts of it, but then another section caught fire and it just spread and spread. There was mayhem on the main road because people were stopping to take pictures\u201d.\nCamper Ben Murphy told local media that he decided to leave his campsite near Three Legged Cross, around two miles from the fire, when he caught sight of the smoke.\nHe said: \u201cWe were there during lunch time...It just got so much worse so quickly, you could tell it was serious straight away. You just don\u2019t expect to see something like that. You could see literally in seconds a huge cloud of smoke\u201d.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

  "argos_summary": "The UK is experiencing its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to reach 34C in some areas, prompting health alerts due to potential increases in heat-related deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations. Despite some rainfall in July, England is facing significant water shortages, impacting agriculture and increasing wildfire risks, as evidenced by a major fire in Dorset that has led to evacuations and a major incident declaration. Experts attribute the extreme weather conditions to climate change, which is causing more frequent and severe heatwaves.",
