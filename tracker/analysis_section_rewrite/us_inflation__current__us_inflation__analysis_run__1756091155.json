      "feedback": "The draft covers many right signals but could reach world-class clarity with a tighter, source-grounded 0–3 week thesis and a crisp, testable causal framework. Actionable edits: (1) refocus the narrative on a tight 0–3 week base-case: near-term risk-on if Powell signals a September 25bp cut and markets price it (~85% odds per 17F49LURJ), while remaining vulnerable to policy/liquidity twists from private‑markets dynamics (BlackRock’s Asia‑private credit pause; Arch Capital sale talks; Mubadala sourcing friction per MW3AO9NFK); anchor this with concrete numbers from sources (MW3AO9NFK, 17F49LURJ). (2) articulate a three-channel causal chain and its asset-rotation implications: monetary/liq‑driven risk appetite; energy cash-flow momentum from Santos (Barossa 98% complete; Darwin ready-for-startup; Pikka first oil moved to Q1 2026; LNG price $11.57/mmbtu) shaping energy equities and LNG exposure (S1OY7ISLY); and private‑credit/liquidity stress signaling dispersion in mid‑cap names (MW3AO9NFK). (3) embed explicit, source-backed catalysts and thresholds: Nvidia earnings as a tech AI proxy; Santos milestones as energy‑cycle ballast; the barrier levels from the Fed path (Sep 25bp cut baked in) and any inflation surprise as the key invalidation for the rally (S1OY7ISLY, 17F49LURJ). (4) build formal near-term scenarios with triggers and invalidations: base case (0–3 weeks)—risk-on bias with AI/tech and energy cash flow; bull case—Nvidia prints strong, energy names lead; bear case—inflation/ tariffs surprise or weaker‑than‑expected data undermines the policy pivot and risk appetite. For each, specify triggers and the exact invalidation point. (5) reconcile competing narratives without force-fitting: present Krugman’s stagflation warning versus the energy/AI investment backdrop as dual risk axes, but attribute to sources and keep near-term drivers policy/liquidity and earnings momentum as the dominant transmission channels (218AGGUXB,  S1OY7ISLY, LLN6N4H3Z). (6) tighten quantitative content and avoid hedging phrasing: quote or paraphrase exact figures (e.g., BlackRock target ~$1b; fundraising less than half; Barossa 98%); Santos metrics; price levels; (MW3AO9NFK, S1OY7ISLY, 218AGGUXB, LLN6N4H3Z, 17F49LURJ). (7) enhance citation discipline and consistency: attach the relevant IDs after every factual claim, ensure no non-source assertions sneak in, and explicitly note any source conflicts with a brief, balanced reconciliation. (8) trim length and sharpen prose to a two-layer narrative: a one-sentence 0–3 week thesis, followed by 3 tight, labeled bullets (Catalysts/Thresholds, Transmission, Watchlist/Invalidation) with 2–3 data points each. Implementing these edits will yield a world-class, minimally ambiguous, numbers-driven, source-anchored 0–3 week view that cleanly maps to the horizon focus.",
