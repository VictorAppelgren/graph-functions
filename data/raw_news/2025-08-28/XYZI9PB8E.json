  "title": "Ravens and Kyle Hamilton were a perfect match. They\u2019ll be together a lot longer, too",
  "description": "Hamilton is a star, just as Baltimore believed he would be. Making sure he remains a Raven for the foreseeable future was an easy call.",
  "content": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. \u2014 As Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh sat across from Kyle Hamilton three years ago, he wanted to know one thing.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Harbaugh asked Hamilton.\n\nHarbaugh wasn\u2019t being disrespectful, and he surely knew that Hamilton was on his pre-draft visit tour that included a stop at the Ravens\u2019 Owings Mills facility. Harbaugh, though, figured it would be the one \u2014 and likely only \u2014 time Hamilton was in the building.\n\nThe Ravens do their due diligence on every draft prospect, but they thought there was no way they\u2019d get even close to an opportunity to select Notre Dame\u2019s standout safety. They believed Hamilton was one of the very best players in the 2022 draft, a legitimate and unique top-five talent who could help transform a defense with his eclectic skill set.\n\nThose types of players aren\u2019t typically options for teams picking 14th overall. Except Hamilton was, and Baltimore still can\u2019t believe its good fortune.\n\nHamilton is a star, just as the Ravens believed he would be. And making sure he remains a Raven for the foreseeable future was one of the easiest calls general manager Eric DeCosta and company have had to make in a while, even though it came at an eye-popping cost.\n\nWith a four-year, $100.4 million extension, which includes a whopping $82 million in guaranteed money, the Ravens made Hamilton the highest-paid safety in NFL history, which feels both fitting and appropriate because Hamilton has spent the previous two years making a compelling case that he is the league\u2019s best at the position.\n\nThe Ravens don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly close.\n\n\u201cI think the deal really does speak to how we feel about Kyle,\u201d DeCosta said after announcing the deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few players over the years become the highest paid at their position, and I think when you are the highest paid, that\u2019s an important distinction. I think Kyle has proven that he\u2019s going to carry that very well, and we expect him to continue to be an impact player on our defense for years to come.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old Hamilton, already a two-time All-Pro, does a little of everything \u2014 and does it all at a high level. He covers. He\u2019s shown an ability to take away top tight ends and match up with speedy receivers in the slot. His transition into a deep safety role last year helped change Baltimore\u2019s defensive fortunes.\n\nHe hits. Hamilton has made 188 tackles over the past two seasons, and quite a few of them have left opposing ball carriers on the ground for just a little longer. Throw a screen pass to Hamilton\u2019s side of the field at your own risk.\n\nHe blitzes. He has seven career sacks and 15 quarterback hits, and he\u2019s working on adding moves to his pass-rushing arsenal, because why not?\n\nHe takes the ball away. Hamilton has five interceptions, three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery over the past two years.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that you love about Kyle is he\u2019s kind of a unicorn,\u201d DeCosta said. \u201cHe can do many different things. He does them all very well.\u201d\n\nAnd this also shouldn\u2019t be overlooked when you analyze a deal of this magnitude. He leads on and off the field and is quite comfortable being front and center. He\u2019s become one of the most vocal Ravens in the locker room, and one of the team\u2019s most willing and cooperative players with the media and out in the community.\n\nHamilton gets it, and he understands the responsibility that he now carries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy amount of money, and I am blessed to be in the position I\u2019m in,\u201d Hamilton said before Wednesday\u2019s practice. \u201cBut my mom always told me, \u2018Money just makes you more of who you already are.\u2019 So, I think it\u2019s a blessing, and I\u2019m excited to help my family, help others with it as well. But I don\u2019t think it really changes my outlook or my perception of who I am as a person. I pride myself on that. No matter what you\u2019re talking about, whether it\u2019s money or experiences or accolades, I try to just stay the same Kyle.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, the Ravens are Lamar Jackson\u2019s team, and they\u2019ll continue to be. As Hamilton noted on Wednesday, Baltimore will always have a chance to lift the Lombardi Trophy while Jackson is healthy and under center. The two-time league MVP is the face of the franchise, the sporting face of the city.\n\nWith a bloated salary-cap number over the next two years, Jackson could become one of the next Ravens to get a contract extension when he\u2019s ready to return to the negotiating table. Both DeCosta and Harbaugh made clear that they aren\u2019t done trying to sign key Ravens to lucrative long-term extensions, and Jackson obviously would be the priority.\n\nBut this was Hamilton\u2019s day, a culmination of contract talks that started in June and truly got serious over the past three weeks. Hamilton, who was kept well apprised of the negotiations, insists that he wasn\u2019t sweating it even if he wanted the deal done before the start of the regular season to avoid any potential distractions.\n\nThe Ravens have known since Hamilton\u2019s breakout in 2023 that they one day were going to have to make him the NFL\u2019s highest-paid safety. There was an acceptance of that because, from owner Steve Bisciotti all the way down through the organization, they believed he deserved it.\n\n\n\n With all due respect to Roquan Smith, a terrific leader and force multiplier in his own right, and to other accomplished veterans such as Marlon Humphrey and Nnamdi Madubuike, Hamilton is the face of this defense going forward. The contract he signed Wednesday morning, which could keep him in Baltimore through at least 2030, ensures that.\n\nHe\u2019s a homegrown Raven who is seven months shy of his 25th birthday. He is charismatic, good-looking, personable, extremely smart and comfortable in just about every setting. He just happens to be extremely good at football, but he\u2019s one of those rare athletes and personalities who you can picture doing whatever he wants to and finding a way to be great at it.\n\nHe checks just about every box, on and off the field, for an organization that knows a thing or two about producing defensive stars and transformational leaders.\n\nAs if on cue, Hamilton spent a chunk of his post-contract extension news conference talking about the brotherhood he shares with teammates, the impact Jackson had on his decision to want to stay a Raven, the philanthropic plans he has now that his future in Baltimore is secure, and his one big goal as a player.\n\n\u201cSuper Bowl, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you check a lot of boxes off, hopefully, throughout your football career. Not to toot my own horn, but I feel like I\u2019ve checked a good bit ever since high school, and a Super Bowl still has yet to be checked. So, that\u2019s the next one that I want to check off. All the personal accolades and stuff, that\u2019s cool. But I feel like, as a team, as an organization \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to Mr. Bisciotti \u2014 and it\u2019s just, a Super Bowl, and we\u2019re not trying to wait anymore.\n\n\u201cWe want to get greedy with that. We want to do that now, as soon as possible, and stack them.\u201d\n\nHamilton also couldn\u2019t help but look back to his draft day about 40 months ago. Harbaugh didn\u2019t expect that Hamilton would be there at No. 14, and Hamilton didn\u2019t either. Yet, as the picks came off the board and Hamilton and his friends and family sat uncomfortably in the green room, he remained calm.\n\n\u201cI think back to draft night, and some people have said some things about where I was drafted, this and that, and where I could be drafted,\u201d Hamilton recalled. \u201cAt the time, I think I was the least mad out of anybody. I knew that I came to the right place.\u201d\n\nAnd now, he\u2019ll be staying a while.",

      "text": "The Baltimore Ravens have made Kyle Hamilton the highest-paid safety in the NFL.\nThey reached an agreement with Hamilton late Tuesday on an extension that will keep the 24-year-old in Baltimore for the foreseeable future. The deal is worth $100.4 million over four years, including $82 million guaranteed, eclipsing the four-year, $86 million pact the Detroit Lions and safety Kerby Joseph agreed to in April, according to team sources.\nAdvertisement\nHamilton, a first-round pick out of Notre Dame in 2022, essentially had two years left on his rookie deal after the Ravens announced in April that they would pick up his fifth-year option for 2026. At the time, the team acknowledged that it remained a priority to extend Hamilton, who has quickly developed into one of the league\u2019s top safeties.\nThe deal comes just 11 days before the Ravens will kick off the 2025 season against the Buffalo Bills at Highmark Stadium.\nHamilton has two Pro Bowl selections in his three NFL seasons, and he\u2019s also garnered All-Pro recognition in each of the past two years. With his smarts, athleticism, versatility and physicality, Hamilton has become one of the centerpieces of a Baltimore defense well-stocked with accomplished veterans and former first-round picks.\nPen to paper on the biggest safety contract in the NFL\u203c\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Gt5YSVtTdp\n\u2014 Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) August 27, 2025\nHe\u2019s also morphed into an on-field leader for the Ravens and one of the more vocal players in the locker room. Hamilton\u2019s active in the community, too.\nIn 2023, ex-Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald used Hamilton as a chess piece, moving him around the defense and matching him up in certain situations. Hamilton responded by registering 81 tackles, three sacks, four interceptions, 13 pass breakups and a defensive touchdown.\nWith his defense struggling to limit big plays early last season, first-year Ravens defensive coordinator Zach Orr was forced to move Hamilton to more of a deep safety role. Hamilton proved to be a stabilizer for the pass defense and finished the season with 107 tackles, two sacks, two forced fumbles and an interception.\nThe selection of first-round safety Malaki Starks in April\u2019s draft is expected to allow Orr to utilize Hamilton similarly to how he was moved around during his breakout 2023 season and get him closer to the line of scrimmage.\nRavens general manager Eric DeCosta has long said the team would prioritize taking care of its own players over spending big in free agency. Hamilton is the latest example of that, and it follows an offseason in which Baltimore also reached long-term agreements with running back Derrick Henry, left tackle Ronnie Stanley and wide receiver Rashod Bateman.\nAdvertisement\nThe team has yet to address the contract of two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson, whose salary-cap number rises to an untenable $74.5 million next year. And the Ravens\u2019 2026 unrestricted free-agent class is primed to include key performers Mark Andrews, Isaiah Likely, Tyler Linderbaum, Odafe Oweh and Travis Jones. However, Hamilton is a big name to cross off the list, and the timing could be critical with safety prices rising in recent years.\n(Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images)"
