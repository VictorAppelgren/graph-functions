      "feedback": "Your draft mixes several unrelated drivers (ICJ opinion, tokenization, Fed policy) and fails to map each to a canonical handle with a clear sign and magnitude, violating the acceptance gate. Replace the generic “rapid tokenization adoption” line with a concrete scenario that links blockchain‑published GDP data (XQMF22EFB) to a 0.3‑0.5 % upside in spx via a 0.3‑0.5 % risk‑premium reduction; cite the source and quantify the impact on ust10y and dxy. Consolidate the ICJ‑related lines into a single, coherent “Up” scenario: ICJ opinion → higher sovereign risk premium → 10‑year UST rise of 10‑15 bp (ZV3QI3K19) and corresponding 0.5‑1 % spx decline; provide a 55 % probability based on the legal‑risk pathway and the COP30 catalyst window. Remove the “Down” line about the court ruling, as it duplicates the ICJ scenario’s invalidation; instead, create a separate “Down” scenario for a Fed hawkish stance: Fed holds rates → 10‑year UST rise of 5‑10 bp → 0.3‑0.6 % spx drop, with a 35 % probability tied to the 16‑17 Sep 2025 FOMC. Ensure each line follows the required format (Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %), includes a canonical handle (ust10y, spx, dxy, gold), and cites the ID. Finally, craft a concise swing‑trade line for spx: “Down | 2025 Q4 | Fed hawkish stance → 10‑year UST rise → spx drop 0.3‑0.6 % | 16‑17 Sep 2025 FOMC | 30‑40 bp entry | 60‑80 bp stop | 120‑160 bp target | Fed rate hike | 35% | 70”. This tightens the analysis, aligns with the pillar framework, and meets the acceptance criteria.",
