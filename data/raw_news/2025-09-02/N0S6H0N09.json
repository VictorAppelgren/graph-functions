  "content": "NEW DELHI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Indian state and federal ministers will meet for two days from Wednesday to weigh the biggest cuts to consumption tax in eight years, aimed at spurring domestic demand in the face of economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs.\n\nCoupled with cuts in personal tax unveiled in February, the cuts in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) are expected to boost consumption in the South Asian nation, whose economy grew at an unexpectedly higher pace of 7.8% in the quarter to June.\n\nA panel on the tax, headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman with ministers from all Indian states, will decide on a plan to cut the tax on more than 400 items, ranging from hair oil to small cars .\n\n\"With U.S. tariffs clouding exports in textiles, autos and possibly pharmaceuticals, India must pivot towards domestic consumption as the primary growth engine,\" said Manoj Mishra, a partner at Grant Thornton Bharat LLP.\n\nThe move is expected to boost sales of FMCG firms such as Hindustan Unilever and Godrej Industries, and consumer electronics companies such as Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) , LG Electronics (066570.KS) and Sony (6758.T) .\n\nAmong automakers Maruti, Toyota Motor (7203.T) and Suzuki Motor (7269.T) are expected to be big winners.\n\nThe rush to cut the tax was triggered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for greater self-reliance, when he vowed to lower GST by October, aiming to counter the U.S. tariffs of up to 50%.\n\nThe ministers will consider a two-rate structure of 5% and 18%, instead of four now, with additional tax bands of 12% and 28%. It will also consider a higher tax of 40% on some luxury and \"sin\" goods such as cigarettes.\n\nThe plan is to sweep into the 5% category all items of daily use now in the category of 12%.\n\nThe panel will also consider lowering taxes on consumer items such as toothpaste and shampoo to 5% from 18%, and on small cars, air conditioners, and televisions to 18% from 28%.\n\nEconomists expect the cuts to cost $21 billion in revenue losses, with states set to lose more than the federal government.\n\nWhile the states are broadly on board, there could be heated discussion on ways to make up their loss of revenue .\n\nThe panel is likely to discuss raising taxes on high end electric vehicles priced at more than 2 million rupees.\n\nIt will also consider raising tax to 18% from 12% on apparel priced above 2,500 rupees ($29), which would affect the premium offerings of Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) , Levi Strauss (LEVI.N) , and Zara.\n\nTaxes on air travel in the premium and business classes could also go to 18% from 12%.\n\n($1=87.5060 Indian rupees)",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."
