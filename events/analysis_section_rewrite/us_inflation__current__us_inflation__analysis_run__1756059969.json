      "feedback": "The draft would be world‑class with a tighter, 0–3 week horizon and a single, explicit transmission channel; actionable edits: (1) reframe the narrative around a crisp causal chain—tariff pass‑through to auto prices (S15934PBQ) drives higher sticker prices, which interacts with tight auto credit (CDBMWIUTB’s 6.43% average rate in March 2024) and elevated depreciation risk (EVs/luxury models per CDBMWIUTB and S15934PBQ)—then test how that feeds discretionary spending (6OOEK8TUR Vegas pricing data) and policy credibility (U6HXAJR4J Lagarde + Powell signals). (2) quantify every linkage with exact numbers and ranges drawn from the sources (e.g., tariff rate drop from 27.5% to 15%; 6.43% auto loan rate; Bethel median price ~$582k–$583k and 5% affordable‑housing stock; depreciation hotspots like BMW 7/5 Series >70% over five years; Vegas price surcharges like $15 Diet Coke, $26 water, $40 nachos as indicative price pressure). (3) insert explicit near‑term catalysts and invalidation tests: next US CPI autos component and tariff commentary, Jackson Hole/ Powell communications, Bethel 8‑30g proceedings, Vessel 8‑30g filings; invalidation occurs if auto pricing shows a sustained deceleration and central‑bank commentary reinforces “lower for longer” or if tariff costs fail to pass through in the next print. (4) sharpen the positioning dynamics: specify which assets or markets move on each channel (autos equities, auto loans, consumer discretionary, USD/yields) and articulate a clear price threshold or trajectory to watch (e.g., persistent tariff pass‑through evidenced by unchanged or rising auto prices in subsequent CPI releases; or a policy credibility shock that eases rate expectations). (5) reconcile conflicts by signaling the dispersion in depreciation and brand‑level risk, citing the BMW/Mercedes/Audi/Land Rover examples from S15934PBQ and the brand‑level context in the 10 Worst Depreciation article (Scraped Source 3) as caveats rather than universal forecasters. (6) tighten the citation discipline so every factual proposition maps to a source ID (S15934PBQ, CDBMWIUTB, 6OOEK8TUR, U6HXAJR4J, F8GF45MEU) and avoid mixing extraneous items; (7) deliver a concise three‑part verdict: immediate driver, near‑term catalyst/price path, and monitoring checklist with concrete data points. This will yield a coherent, testable 0–3 week momentum thesis with explicit levels/thresholds and a clear red/green monitoring map. Citations: (S15934PBQ)(CDBMWIUTB)(6OOEK8TUR)(U6HXAJR4J)(F8GF45MEU).",
