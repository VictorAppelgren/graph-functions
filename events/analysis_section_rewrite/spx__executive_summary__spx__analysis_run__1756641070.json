      "feedback": "**Actionable edit guide (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Add explicit spx mapping** – every claim about the S&P 500 must include a `(spx)` citation.  \n2. **Condense to 4–6 sentences** – merge the first two sentences into one that states the 3‑5 % downside, cites the Fed September FOMC, core PCE, and the 1.8‑2.2 % 10‑yr yield band, and ends with `(spx)(OGK8WLL69)(B1KYJ1GPU)(3YAQ8JUPL)(8)`.  \n3. **Trim extraneous handles** – remove references to `ust10y`, `dxy`, and other non‑spx handles unless they directly explain the equity view; keep only those that support the causal chain (e.g., `2yr10yr_spread` if you argue it drives term premium).  \n4. **Re‑phrase risk sentence** – keep the Fed reversal, inflation acceleration, VIX spike, and earnings‑season risk, but add `(spx)` and a catalyst window (e.g., “Fed September FOMC” or “August 30 PCE”) and end with `(spx)(OGK8WLL69)(LF0UUL917)(B1KYJ1GPU)(FAN5RYW6T)`.  \n5. **Watch‑signal sentence** – include `(spx)` and a brief catalyst window for each signal, ending with `(spx)(OGK8WLL69)(Z7O1DCHS7)(3YAQ8JUPL)(CG8ZKHFI2)(8)`.  \n6. **Confidence sentence** – add `(spx)` and keep the same catalyst references, ending with `(spx)(OGK8WLL69)(FAN5RYW6T)(CG8ZKHFI2)(8)(B1KYJ1GPU)`.  \n7. **Remove any sentence that drifts** – e.g., any mention of `dxy` or `ust10y` without a clear link to equity demand.  \n8. **Ensure every sentence has a clear causal link back to spx** – if a handle is cited, explain how it feeds equity pricing (e.g., “a 1‑bp Fed cut lowers the 10‑yr yield, tightening the term premium and compressing equity valuations”).  \nAfter these edits, the brief should read as a 4‑sentence, bullet‑style executive view:  \n- **View**: S&P 500 will decline 3‑5 % over 3‑6 months as the Fed’s September FOMC is expected to cut rates, compressing the 10‑yr yield to 1.8‑2.2 % and tightening the term premium; the high Shiller P/E (≈35) and 40 % top‑10 concentration amplify downside risk (spx)(OGK8WLL69)(B1KYJ1GPU)(3YAQ8JUPL)(8).  \n- **Catalysts**: Fed September FOMC (2025‑09‑16‑17), August 30 core PCE, late‑September Tesla verdict, mid‑September Marvell earnings, early‑September tariff announcements; a favorable cut or verdict will support ≈5,200, while a delay or upheld verdict will push toward 4,680‑4,900 (spx)(B1KYJ1GPU)(3YAQ8JUPL)(LJZYDXVL3)(5GZPY1XUE)(56DSYR7J6).  \n- **Risks**: Fed reversal or inflation acceleration widening the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, VIX spikes, stronger‑than‑expected tech earnings; any of these would blunt the correction (spx)(OGK8WLL69)(LF0UUL917)(B1KYJ1GPU)(FAN5RYW6T).  \n- **Watch signals**: Fed minutes, core PCE releases, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, top‑10 concentration, Shiller P/E; a widening spread or sudden 10‑yr rise signals tightening bias, a flattening spread erodes dollar advantage and weakens spx (spx)(OGK8WLL69)(Z7O1DCHS7)(3YAQ8JUPL)(CG8ZKHFI2)(8).  \n- **Confidence**: moderate‑high, contingent on Fed policy and earnings surprises; monitor closely (spx)(OGK8WLL69)(FAN5RYW6T)(CG8ZKHFI2)(8)(B1KYJ1GPU).",
