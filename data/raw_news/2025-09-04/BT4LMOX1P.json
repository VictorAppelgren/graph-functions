Drummer Ringo Starr of the Beatles at the Melody Maker awards, London, 13th September 1966. Readers of the magazine have voted the Beatles best group in both the British and International Sections. (Photo by Mark and Colleen Hayward/Getty Images)\n\nRingo Starr has enjoyed a lengthy solo career outside of The Beatles. All four members carved out their own musical path, and both he and Paul McCartney are still releasing new music decades after the group\u2019s breakup. In recent years, Starr has experimented with different styles \u2014 even stepping into country recently \u2014 and now a pair of singles from his latest EPs are back on the U.K. charts, where he remains a legend.\n\n\u201cCrooked Boy\u201d reappears on the Official Physical Singles chart at No. 42. The tune comes close to returning to the top 40 region, which it has visited before. The cut previously peaked as high as No. 2, just barely missing out on giving Starr a late-in-career champion.\n\n\u201cRewind Forward\u201d Is Back as Well\n\nAlongside \u201cCrooked Boy,\u201d \u201cRewind Forward\u201d also finds its way back to the same ranking. The tune returns to the list at No. 64. Earlier in its life, it rose as high as No. 4.\n\nThe two returning Starr tracks have spent months \u2013 29 weeks for \u201cCrooked Boy\u201d and 39 for \u201cRewind Forward\u201d \u2013 on the Official Physical Singles chart, which ranks the bestselling tunes in the U.K. on formats like CD, vinyl, and cassette. Neither has been absent for long, as it\u2019s only been a few weeks since either title was last seen on the roster.\n\nThroughout his solo career, Starr has now placed solo five cuts onto the Official Physical Singles chart. Four of those have reached the top 10, with one even climbing all the way to No. 1. That honor belongs to \u201cWorld Go Round,\u201d which stands as his only chart-topper on the list to date.",
