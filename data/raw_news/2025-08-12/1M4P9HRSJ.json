  "content": "Fake news took another victim in Odell Beckham Jr. on Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, an X account parodying ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter spread a fake rumor that the former Giants star was retiring from the NFL.\n\n\u201cAfter 10 seasons in the NFL, Odell Beckham Jr. has decided to retire,\u201d the account, which goes by @AdamSche1fer, wrote. \u201cBeckham Jr. played for the Giants, Browns, Rams, Ravens, and Dolphins. He announced Tuesday.\u201d\n\nThe post apparently made it to Beckham, currently a free agent with Opening Night less than a month away.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowler set the record straight with a reply to the post, saying \u201cLOL WTF\u2026 when was that announced and by who? That\u2019s funny, appreciate the concerns but this Shxt ain\u2019t over yet.\u201d\n\nA minute later, Beckham doubled down, writing \u201cNot done yet\u2026 thanks for hr concerns and have a blessed day.\u201d\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cNo seriously,\u201d Beckham wrote on the platform a little over an hour later. \u201cPlz stop reading everything on the internet, and stop texting me happy retirement b4 u piss me off. That will get no response. I promise u the day I\u2019m done I will let u kno. Again if u text me happy retirement im just gon have to block u. Thanks.\u201d\n\nBeckham, 32, is without a job after playing nine games and catching nine passes for 55 yards with the Dolphins last season.\n\nHe began his career in 2014 with the Giants, who drafted him 12th overall, and was later traded to the Browns in March 2019 and spent time with the Ravens, Rams and Dolphins after his time in Cleveland.\n\nIn 10 NFL seasons, Beckham has totaled 575 receptions for 7,987 receiving yards and 59 touchdowns. He won Super LVI with the Rams.",

It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in. Our headsets and mics work flawlessly, our sets are stocked, and our camera operators have been setting the scene for days.\u201d\nBalionis made headlines off the course last May when a Daily Mail report linked her and McIlroy after he filed for divorce from his wife of seven years, Erica Stoll.\nMcIlroy, 36, and Stoll have since reunited, and his divorce petition was voluntarily dismissed.\nFans noticed Balionis wasn\u2019t wearing her wedding ring last February while covering the Genesis Invitational.\nBalionis married former North Carolina quarterback Bryn Renner, who also had a brief career in the NFL, in 2022.\nBalionis, who wasn\u2019t wearing her ring in the Ibiza photos, has not publicly addressed speculation about a divorce, but Renner no longer appears on her social media pages.\nUs Weekly confirmed last spring that Balinois and the reigning Masters champ \u201care not dating and only have a professional relationship.\u201d\nBalionis joined CBS Sports in 2017 as a golf reporter and also serves as a sideline reporter for select NFL ON CBS games and CBS Sports Network college football games."
