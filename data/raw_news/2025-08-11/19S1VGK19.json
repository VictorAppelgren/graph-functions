  "content": "CALGARY, AB / ACCESS Newswire / August 11, 2025 / NXT Energy Solutions Inc. (\"NXT\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:SFD)(OTCQB:NSFDF) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Dollar amounts are in Canadian Dollars, unless otherwise identified. Bruce G. Wilcox, CEO of NXT, commented, \"SFD\u00ae revenues of $14.1 million for the first half of the year reflect our financial transformation through repeat contracts in high potential regions and our focus on geographical diversification. Also, convertible debentures have been a critical element of NXT's finance plan with US$5,675,000 being converted to common shares during Q2-25. Our year-to-date net income of $0.70 million was reduced by a non-cash charge of $7.74 million, primarily the result of a fair value adjustment to convertible debentures following the 178% increase in NXT's share price during Q2-25. The convertible debentures that were subject to the fair value adjustment, were issued with conversion prices of either US$0.1808 or US$0.25, which reflected a premium to the prevailing market price of NXT shares at the time of issuance. Also worth mentioning, is the net working capital improvement of $10.53 million. We have announced SFD\u00ae surveys for the remainder of 2025 and are working on contract bookings for 2026.
