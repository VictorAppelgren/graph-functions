      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but still feels like a high‑level overview rather than a world‑class research note. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly mapping each macro driver to its market transmission: e.g., CPI 2.7 % → real‑rate differential 4.0 % → 70 % probability of a 50 bp Fed cut → dollar 2–3 % depreciation → corporate spread narrowing 300–350 bp → S&P 500 compression. Add a brief first‑principles paragraph that explains why a 50 bp cut would reduce corporate spreads (lower discount rates on future cash flows) and why a weaker dollar lifts equity valuations (lower import costs, higher earnings per share). Expand the oil section to include a quantitative range for crude prices (e.g., $70–$80 / bbl) and explain how a 2.5 m bpd supply increase translates into a 5–10 % price decline, citing J99EM2TPZ. Introduce a concise scenario table: (1) “Fed cuts, oil flat” (base case), (2) “Fed holds, oil spikes” (high‑risk), (3) “Fed cuts, oil falls” (low‑risk), each with clear catalysts (Fed minutes, retail sales, IEA forecast) and invalidation triggers (unexpected CPI rebound, OPEC+ production cuts). Replace generic phrases like “mixed backdrop” with specific risk‑on/off metrics (e.g., “risk‑on sentiment measured by the VIX is expected to stay above 20”). Ensure every claim has a citation: add IDs for the CPI data (LZG5YWQMC), Fed funds rate (C3ODMIQKZ), oil supply forecast (J99EM2TPZ), and S&P reaction (V7GV8YBQU). Finally, craft a one‑sentence watch‑list: “Key signals: Fed September minutes (policy stance), June retail sales (consumer spending), IEA 2025 demand forecast (oil outlook), and the 10‑day oil inventory report.” This will elevate the analysis to a concise, data‑driven, and actionable research note.",
