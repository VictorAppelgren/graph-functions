  "title": "How mRNA Vaccine Platform Suffers Mainly From Manufactured Distrust",
  "description": "Bhattacharya said mRNA technology \u201cshouldn't be used as a platform for mass vaccination\u201d because the public doesn\u2019t trust it. But distrust is mainly from misinformation.",
  "content": "Director of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya, recently stated that the mRNA technology \u201cshould not be used as a platform for mass vaccination.\u201d This raises the question, why? Bhattacharya says it\u2019s because the public doesn\u2019t trust it. However, it seems the public\u2019s qualms stem in large part from misinformation with respect to the COVID-19 vaccines. As such, the mRNA vaccine platform suffers mainly from manufactured distrust.\n\nMisgivings expressed by top officials like Bhattacharya prompted the federal government\u2019s discontinuation of mRNA vaccine development programs last month. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. then announced that the federal government\u2019s emergency preparedness agency, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, will no longer fund work on messenger RNA vaccines. Namely, BARDA is terminating 22 grants supporting development of mRNA vaccines, worth a total of $500 million.\n\nThe agency\u2019s ending of new federal investments in mRNA technology was presaged earlier this year by substantial cuts imposed by the Department of HHS when it discontinued dozens of mRNA-related research projects. Many of the canceled grants concerned work related to vaccine hesitancy and uptake of vaccinations, but they also included ones on clinical development of mRNA vaccines. In May, for example, BARDA rescinded $766 million in grants to Moderna for work the vaccine manufacturer was doing to develop, test, and bring through licensure several vaccines for influenza viruses that could trigger pandemics.\n\nOn a Steve Bannon podcast, Bhattacharya said that the mRNA vaccine platform is \u201cpromising but not yet ready for prime time for vaccines.\u201d He attributed this to public distrust. And in defense of the decision, Kennedy erroneously stated that \u201cthe data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.\u201d He also pointed to cases of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, which have been observed after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in rare instances. What Kennedy didn\u2019t say, however, is that contracting COVID-19 increases the risk of myocarditis at a higher rate than vaccination does. And what Bhattacharya failed to mention is that the vaccines served the public well. Numerous peer-reviewed studies have found that mRNA vaccines are safe and effective and saved at least 2.5 million lives globally, with some estimates pointing to as many as 20 million.\n\nmRNA Vaccine Platform Is About More Than Just COVID-19\n\nThe mRNA vaccine technology was famously deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, allowing for the creation, testing and regulatory approval of vaccines within 11 months of the sharing of the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines each contain mRNA, which instructs cells to manufacture the coronavirus spike protein, simulating infection with the virus. This induces an immune system response to the spike protein that is present on the coronavirus.\n\nBut this is merely one application of the platform. Others are being tested, including in the HIV space. And these are also being subject federal government funding cutbacks. According to The Atlantic, numerous partnerships between the National Institutes of Health and HIV vaccine researchers have been terminated under Kennedy\u2019s watch. Given that such disruption is occurring in the HIV space, perhaps other diseases will be affected, too. mRNA vaccines are also being developed to prevent melanoma and lung cancer, malaria, Lyme disease and Zika, as well as to protect newborns from congenital infections like cytomegalovirus.\n\nKennedy\u2019s moves represent the latest setback to mRNA research. While researchers Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman received a Nobel prize in 2023 for their mRNA work aimed at preventing and treating a wide range of diseases, during their decades of work they had to overcome numerous challenges.\n\nSince the 1960s, there was consensus around the critical role that mRNA plays as a translator of sorts in protein synthesis\u2014the process responsible for almost all cellular functions in the human body. This helical strand of molecules allows for information contained in DNA in the nucleus of cells to be delivered to ribosomes where protein synthesis can occur. However, scientists expressed doubts pertaining to the therapeutic viability of mRNA products: mRNA was considered too unstable and limited in its ability to produce an immune response.\n\nKarik\u00f3 and Weissman persisted in their mRNA research because they fervently believed that the platform held the future for vaccinations that could trigger the immune system to fight numerous types of diseases, of which COVID-19 is thus far the most notable.\n\nSoon after the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, a veritable flood of misinformation followed\u2014often in the guise of unfounded conspiracy theories featuring prominently on social media. Among many myths, the products were alleged to include a microchip for government tracking, rewrite a person\u2019s DNA, make people magnetic, cause infertility and result in unexplained \u201csudden deaths.\u201d\n\nThis led to widespread concerns about the vaccines and partly contributed to the U.S. having worse COVID-19 outcomes than its peers as the nation in 2021 and 2022 trailed other similarly wealthy nations in vaccination rates, particularly among people most at risk of severe disease\u2014the over-65 age group, immunocompromised and those with other comorbid conditions.\n\nIn their book, The Big Myth: How American Business Taught Us to Loathe Government and Love the Free Market, Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway suggest that many millions of Americans seemed to either \u201cdisbelieve what government officials were telling them about COVID-19 or to regard public health measures such as vaccines and mask mandates as encroachments on their liberty.\u201d The authors claim that 40% of COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented if Americans trusted science and government more.\n\nLikewise, in The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science, Peter Hotez, researcher and professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine, writes that 200,000 Americans needlessly lost their lives to COVID-19 during the Delta and Omicron variant waves in 2021 and early 2022, respectively. According to Hotez, many refused to get vaccinated because they were victims of an organized antivaccine disinformation campaign.\n\nA published study in JAMA Network Open suggested that if public health recommendations had been followed, including better vaccination levels, approximately 33% of the COVID-19 deaths in America could have been avoided.\n\nBut misinformation wasn\u2019t the only problem during the pandemic. The CDC\u2019s messages asserting that vaccinated individuals \u201cdo not carry the virus, don\u2019t get sick and aren\u2019t contagious\u201d proved wrong and had to be reversed. Public health officials also committed missteps in conveying the use value of masks. An internal review found that communication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was muddled and inconsistent.\n\nThe issue of problematic communication wasn\u2019t confined to public health leaders. In the winter and spring of 2021, for example, the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, posted messages on social media saying the COVID-19 vaccine would stop transmission. In April 2021, for instance, Bourla tweeted, \u201cExcited to share that updated analysis from our Phase 3 study with BioNTech also showed that our Covid-19 vaccine was 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 cases in South Africa. 100%!\u201d\n\nYet four months earlier, the Food and Drug Administration declared that \u201cat this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.\u201d It took more than a year for CDC to produce a report saying that the COVID-19 vaccine offered limited \u201ctransient protection.\u201d\n\nThis takes us back to Bhattacharya\u2019s criticism of mRNA vaccines. He asserts that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent infection. Here, he rails against the early messaging on the vaccines. But in the end, his view lacks nuance as it\u2019s not accurate. They can help to prevent transmission, but the effect wanes rather quickly over time. None of the COVID-19 vaccines, whether mRNA-based or not, permanently block infections from happening. This isn\u2019t that surprising. In fact, it\u2019s analogous to influenza vaccines. All approved COVID-19 vaccines, however, do lower the risk of severe infection that can lead to hospitalization or death. Published peer-reviewed data are unequivocal in this regard. These vaccines save lives.\n\nIn hindsight, perhaps an approach to informing the public that strictly emphasized the proven benefits of COVID-19 vaccination would have been more fruitful. It could have also helped avert federal government cutbacks in funding of mRNA vaccine research.",

      "text": "When Drs. Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman first met at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Karik\u00f3 had been demoted and was moving from job to job because she lacked funding to support her research. Dr. Karik\u00f3\u2019s research was in using messenger RNA (mRNA) to treat disease, however, her ideas were met with great skepticism by the scientific community. Fortunately, Dr. Weissman, an immunologist, also had an interest in this area. He welcomed Dr. Karik\u00f3 into his lab in 1997, and the two have collaborated on synthetic mRNA treatments ever since.\nPerseverance\nDespite numerous rejections and setbacks, the two persisted in their mRNA research because they believed that this held the future for vaccinations that could bolster our immune system to fight numerous types of diseases. This approach was attractive because if it worked, it would mean people could gain immunity without having to be injected with an actual strain of a virus, which was the norm up until the Covid-19 pandemic. Drs. Karik\u00f3 and Weissman\u2019s decades of perseverance paved the way for the technology needed to combat and pull the world out of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread to infect 771 million people. It contributed to 6.9 million deaths worldwide. Social distancing became the norm as countries went on lockdown, and work from home became common for people not on the front lines. Despite the precautionary measures, it became clear that the only way out of the pandemic would be the introduction of an effective vaccine. Two of them received emergency use authorization in the U.S. in December 2020, and both used the mRNA technology that Drs. Karik\u00f3 and Weissman had spent more than two decades perfecting.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines each contain mRNA, which instructs cells to manufacture the Covid-19 spike protein, simulating infection with Covid-19. Because the immune system sees this protein as an invader, it mounts an immune response to the spike protein that is present on the coronavirus, thereby giving the person robust immunity to Covid-19. So far 81% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose and 70 percent of the population is considered fully vaccinated.\nEyes On The Prize\nThe Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute decided Monday to award the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly to Drs. Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman, who paved the way for the development of the mRNA vaccines that contributed immensely to ending the pandemic and saving countless lives. Both vaccines were 95% effective at preventing disease. What surprised the world was how fast these vaccines were developed and how well they worked. This was largely due to the innovative approach of these two newest Nobel laureates.\nThis was possible because the mRNA provides biological induction by delivering a DNA blueprint that the body can use to make proteins. When Drs. Karik\u00f3 and Weissman first started collaborating, they began their experiments by injecting mice with mRNA, however many of the mice were getting sick and some even died. Eventually they packaged the mRNA into a lipid nanoparticle, which helped it to evade detection by the host immune system until it got to its target location. They also incorporated pseudouridine into the mRNA. Pseudouridine enhanced RNA stability inside the body and it decreases anti-RNA immune response. These modifications kept the animals from getting sick after the injections and allowed them to successfully create vaccines for mice.\nHowever, success in mice does not always translate to success in humans. In order to create an mRNA vaccine for Covid-19, the scientists first needed to have the DNA template. The DNA template was provided on January 11, 2020 by Chinese scientists who had the earliest exposure to the virus. This mRNA technology worked so well that the time between the Chinese government providing their SARS-CoV-2 genetic structure and Moderna transporting its vaccine candidate to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States for phase one studies was just 44 days. It is notable that other vaccines that used the same technology without the pseudouridine were not as successful as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.\nThe Scientists\nDr. Katalin Karik\u00f3 received her bachelor's degree in biology in 1978 and her doctorate in biochemistry in 1982 from the University of Szeged in her native Hungary. Her lab in Hungary lacked funding, so she moved to the U.S. and started work as a postdoctoral fellow at Temple University and eventually transitioned to a position at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Karik\u00f3 has been researching mRNA-based therapy since 1990, when she became an adjunct professor at Penn. Dr. Karik\u00f3 research was met with great skepticism and resulted in grant rejections and her manuscripts not being accepted for publication by major journals. She was demoted and \u201ckicked out from Penn,\u201d which led to her pursuing an opportunity to work in Germany with BioNTech in 2013. There, she initially served as vice president and in 2019 she was promoted to senior vice president. She has since returned to Penn, where she is adjunct professor of neurosurgery.\nDr. Drew Weissman received his bachelor\u2019s degree from Brandeis University and his M.D. and Ph.D. in 1987 from Boston University. He completed his residency at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center followed by a fellowship at the National Institutes of Health, under the supervision of Dr. Anthony Fauci, who at the time was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Weissman is professor of medicine and director of the Institute for RNA Innovation at Penn Medicine.\nIn her interview with the Nobel Committee, Dr. Karik\u00f3\u2019s message to female scientists was \u201cyou don\u2019t have to choose between having a family, you can have it, you don\u2019t have to over assist your child, your child will watch you and they will do, because that\u2019s what counts, the example that you present.\u201d Indeed, Dr. Karik\u00f3\u2019s daughter followed her mom\u2019s persistence and is a two-time Olympic champion and five-time world champion in rowing.\nDrs. Karik\u00f3 and Weissman marshalled in the technology to fight off this invisible enemy known as Covid-19. Indeed, by making visible the approach to successful immunization against this lethal disease, they too became visible to the world and have rightfully earned the honor of being called Nobel laureates. Like any great scientists, they have their eyes on what\u2019s next. They are looking to cure other diseases with this technology, including sickle cell disease, various forms of cancer and also creating other vaccines to address other diseases like flu, malaria, leptospirosis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Drs. Karik\u00f3 and Weissman provide hope to scientists conducting research not yet appreciated by the scientific community and they also provide hope for humanity that collectively we have the talent to fight the most lethal of enemies, even when invisible, as was seen with the Covid-19 pandemic."

      "text": "Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman are pioneering scientists whose dedication to understanding messenger RNA (mRNA) has reshaped modern medicine. Their foundational contributions to mRNA technology moved it from a theoretical concept to a practical tool. This work has paved the way for advancements in various therapeutic areas, creating a new approach to disease prevention and treatment.\nTheir Scientific Journey and Collaboration\nKatalin Karik\u00f3 focused on RNA research, facing challenges in funding and recognition. Her early career showed persistence despite skepticism about mRNA\u2019s therapeutic viability. Drew Weissman also pursued independent research, driven by immunology and vaccine development.\nTheir paths converged at the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-1990s. An encounter led to discussions about their shared scientific interests, forming a collaboration. At the time, the scientific community largely dismissed mRNA as too unstable and immunogenic for medical applications. Despite this skepticism, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman explored mRNA\u2019s therapeutic potential.\nThe mRNA Modification Breakthrough\nA key challenge for mRNA as a therapeutic agent was its instability and tendency to provoke a strong inflammatory immune response. Unmodified mRNA was quickly degraded by the immune system, triggering cellular defenses that prevented efficient protein production. This limited its effectiveness and caused side effects.\nKarik\u00f3 and Weissman\u2019s solution involved altering mRNA\u2019s molecular structure. They discovered that substituting uridine with pseudouridine allowed mRNA to evade detection by the body\u2019s immune sensors, significantly reducing inflammation. This modification also enhanced the efficiency of protein translation within cells. This discovery, published in 2005, transformed mRNA into a promising therapeutic platform.\nImpact on Vaccine Development and Beyond\nKarik\u00f3 and Weissman\u2019s discovery enabled the rapid development of mRNA vaccines, notably for COVID-19. Their work provided the blueprint for creating stable, non-inflammatory mRNA that instructs human cells to produce viral proteins. This allows the immune system to recognize and defend against pathogens without exposure to the actual virus. The advantages of mRNA vaccine technology, like speed of development and adaptability, became evident during the pandemic.\nUnlike traditional vaccine methods requiring growing viruses, mRNA vaccines can be designed and manufactured quickly once a pathogen\u2019s genetic sequence is known. This allows swift responses to emerging viral threats and new variants. Beyond infectious disease vaccines, their discovery has opened new frontiers in medicine. Researchers are exploring mRNA technology for cancer therapies, gene editing, and treatments for genetic disorders.\nRecognition and Legacy\nKarik\u00f3 and Weissman\u2019s work received international recognition. They were jointly awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Nobel Assembly cited their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications, which enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines. This award underscored their scientific contributions.\nTheir legacy extends beyond accolades, changing vaccinology and opening new frontiers in medicine. Their persistence in pursuing overlooked research, despite initial skepticism and funding challenges, serves as an inspiration. Their scientific insight provided a new tool for combating infectious diseases and laid the groundwork for mRNA-based therapeutics with broad applications across human health."

      "text": "HIV\u2019s Most Promising Breakthrough Has Taken a Hit\nSeveral mRNA vaccine trials found a debilitating side effect, and now the Trump administration is cutting funding for more research.\nListen to more stories on the Noa app.\nUpdated at 3:38 p.m. ET on May 31, 2025\nSolving HIV vaccination\u2014a puzzle that scientists have been tackling for decades without success\u2014could be like cracking the code to a safe. The key, they now think, may be delivering a series of different shots in a specific sequence, iteratively training the body to produce a strong, broad immune response that will endure against the fast-mutating virus, ideally for a lifetime.\nFiguring out which ingredients to include in those shots, and in which order, is one of the trickiest immunological conundrums that researchers have ever faced. But mRNA, the fast, flexible technology that delivered two of the world\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccines in record time, is ideal for that kind of brute-force tinkering, and may be the most important tool for getting an effective HIV vaccine, Julie McElrath, the head of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, in Seattle, told me. Multiple mRNA-based HIV vaccines are now in clinical trials, and early data suggest that they\u2019re prompting the type of immune responses that researchers think are essential to keeping HIV at bay\u2014and that other vaccine candidates have struggled to elicit at all.\nBut recently, several promising mRNA HIV-vaccine candidates have slammed up against a technical roadblock. In two small clinical trials, 7 to 18 percent of participants developed rashes and other skin reactions after getting the shots\u2014including multiple cases of chronic hives that troubled volunteers for months after they were immunized. All of the vaccines were manufactured by Moderna.\nThe rashes aren\u2019t life-threatening; they\u2019re also readily treatable. Still, they can be debilitating and distressing. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients who literally can\u2019t go to work,\u201d Kimberly Blumenthal, an allergist and immunologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who has treated people with chronic hives, told me. The rate at which they\u2019re occurring in the trials is also out of the norm, and no one has an explanation yet for the root cause. To prioritize patient safety, mRNA HIV-vaccine research in people has slowed as researchers try to suss out the cause of the hives, William Schief, the Scripps Research Institute biophysicist who helped design the vaccines, told me. (Schief also holds titles at Moderna and at IAVI, the nonprofit that sponsored some of the HIV-vaccine work.)\nAt any time, a side effect this uncomfortable and prolonged would give researchers pause. But in 2025, a setback for a high-profile mRNA vaccine trial\u2014focused on HIV, no less\u2014could more fundamentally upend potentially lifesaving research.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime and prominent anti-vaccine activist, has repeatedly questioned the safety of mRNA COVID vaccines. He and agency leaders are already recommending that fewer Americans take vaccines and creating new hurdles to vaccine approval. Since January, the National Institutes of Health, under HHS\u2019s direction, has also terminated funding for hundreds of research projects related to HIV and vaccines. This week, the department canceled Moderna\u2019s nearly $600 million contract to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines.\nThe HIV-vaccine studies that detected the skin reactions were also supported by NIH funding, and the researchers involved collaborated directly with NIH scientists. But those partnerships have since been terminated, and the NIH is now telling several agency-supported researchers working on HIV vaccines that the government is not planning to continue funding their work, according to several researchers I talked with.\nWhen reached for comment, Emily Hilliard, HHS\u2019s press secretary, wrote in an email, \u201cThe reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public\u201d\u2014referencing the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which were rigorously tested in clinical trials, and billions of doses of which have been safely administered people around the world.\nUnder normal circumstances, detecting rashes in a small vaccine-safety study would represent a routine scientific setback, and prove that the trials served their intended purpose. But the administration\u2019s anti-vaccine stances have created a culture of fear among scientists: Several of the researchers I contacted for this story declined to comment, for fear of publicly tying their name or institution to reporting on mRNA vaccines and losing funding for their research. Science requires resources and open discussion\u2014in torpedoing both, the Trump administration is rapidly undoing decades of progress toward ending the HIV pandemic.\nResearchers running the mRNA HIV-vaccine trials first took note of the rashes in 2022, shortly after studies began. But as they started to publicly discuss the side effect, and media reports of them began to emerge, many scientists in the field weren\u2019t quite sure what to make of the initial findings. The trial in which it had been reported had enrolled only 60 people, and it wasn\u2019t set up to rigorously look at a mysterious side effect. \u201cThe sort of feeling was, Yeah, that\u2019s a bit weird, God knows what happened,\u201d John Moore, an HIV researcher and vaccinologist at Cornell, told me. This April and May, though, researchers independently published two papers describing the rashes, for four separate vaccines, in two separate trials: one for the IAVI-backed vaccine and another run by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Now, the side effect is \u201creal, confirmed, generalizable,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know why it\u2019s happening.\u201d\nThe vaccines in question target slightly different parts of the virus. But all of them rely on a Moderna-manufactured mRNA backbone, and all of them triggered, in up to about 10 percent of participants, chronic hives that emerged a few days or weeks after vaccination and in many cases lasted for months. That\u2019s a long time to be battling itching and discomfort\u2014and it threatens to be a major deterrent to completing the series of vaccines, or potentially starting at all, Genevieve Fouda, an immunologist and HIV researcher at Cornell, told me.\nDelayed, chronic hives have long been known as a rare side effect of vaccines, including mRNA-based COVID vaccines. But the rates are generally very low\u2014usually well under 1 percent, and often detectable only in massive studies of thousands of people. To see these rashes crop up in two small safety studies\u2014one of 60 people, the other of 108\u2014is a significant departure from precedent, scientists told me. And working out why they\u2019re appearing at such high rates will take time. Although researchers understand that the reactions are a kind of autoimmunity\u2014in which the body inadvertently learns to attack itself\u2014they don\u2019t know exactly why rashes occur after certain immunizations or infections, Blumenthal told me.\nIn this case, the data so far do point to the specific combination of mRNA and HIV as a root cause. Other mRNA vaccines, including Moderna\u2019s, haven\u2019t had this issue to anywhere near this degree; neither have other HIV vaccines that have made it into people. And several researchers pointed out to me that, so far, the only trials that they\u2019re aware of in which these hives have turned up at this frequency have involved a Moderna-manufactured product. None of the other vaccines being tested by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, for instance, has seen rashes at that rate\u2014including other, non-Moderna mRNA HIV vaccines, Jim Kublin, the director of HVTN, told me. (Barton Haynes, the Duke immunologist leading work on one of the non-Moderna vaccines, told me he and his colleagues have not encountered the same skin-reaction problem.) Hives also appear to have been a more common side effect of the Moderna COVID vaccines than of the Pfizer ones, though still overall rare. \u201cThis is truly an outlier in terms of what we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Robert Paris, a vice president at Moderna, told me.\nA persistent mRNA problem would be a major blow to HIV-vaccine development. When the technology emerged, it sped progress like nothing else: \u201cThings that originally took us about three years, we could do them in maybe three and a half months or so,\u201d Mark Feinberg, the head of IAVI, told me. The early results for these vaccines have also been very promising, and before the hives were detected, researchers were well on their way to testing even more iterations of mRNA-based HIV vaccines, to crack the final immunization code. But for the moment, \u201cthere\u2019s no appetite to say, \u2018Let\u2019s try all these different immunogens and see what happens,\u2019\u201d Schief, the Scripps researcher who helped design the vaccines, told me.\nStill, most of the researchers I spoke with insisted that they\u2019ll find a solution soon. The mRNA vaccines for HIV \u201care not at all dead in the water,\u201d Kublin told me. If needed, scientists could tweak the vaccine recipe, or combine the mRNA approach with another technology. The fix may be as simple as lowering the vaccine dose, a strategy that Schief and Feinberg are working to test in a new trial based in South Africa. (Moderna\u2019s COVID vaccine also contained more than three times as much mRNA as Pfizer\u2019s\u2014and one study found that lowering the Moderna dose seemed to reduce the rate of certain skin reactions.)\nSuccessful HIV vaccination may require a balancing act\u2014minimizing hives, while still delivering enough mRNA to rile up the immune system. But researchers may not be able to drive the rates of skin reactions down to zero: HIV is especially adept at cloaking itself from the immune system, and there may be few ways to force the body to attack the virus without producing collateral damage. And Schief and others couldn\u2019t say what rate of hives would be acceptably low. The virus is so infectious and deadly that some minor side effects may be worth the risk, if the vaccine is effective at generating the right immune response. But even a perfect, immunity-inducing shot won\u2019t do the world any good if people are afraid to take it.\nStill, if a rash can dissuade someone from vaccination, so, too, can misinformation, or an official\u2019s decision to stop recommending a shot. No vaccine progress will be made if the federal government doesn\u2019t want it to happen: Paris, of Moderna, told me that earlier this spring, the NIH terminated its partnership with the researchers developing these mRNA HIV vaccines, forcing the scientists to seek alternate sources of support. And yesterday, Schief and Haynes were told that their groups at Scripps and Duke would not have the opportunity to renew funding for the two HIV-vaccine-focused research consortia that their institutions lead\u2014millions of dollars that the researchers had been told to expect they would receive, and that have been powering the development of their mRNA shots. The rationale, Haynes told me, as it was described to him, was \u201cdue to the desire to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV.\u201d Currently available approaches include community education and preventive drugs, but notably, no vaccine. (HHS did not respond to questions about these funding shifts.)\n\u201cUnless we can find a substitute source of support, this work won\u2019t go forward,\u201d Haynes told me. If the project of HIV vaccination looks less promising right now than it has in years, that\u2019s not about science or technology, or about any single side effect: It\u2019s about politics."

      "text": "Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced yesterday that the federal government\u2019s emergency preparedness agency, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, will no longer fund work on messenger RNA vaccines.\nBARDA is terminating 22 grants supporting development of mRNA vaccines, worth a total of $500 million. The agency\u2019s ending of new federal investments in mRNA technology was presaged earlier this year by substantial cuts imposed by the Department of HHS when it terminated dozens of mRNA-related research projects. Most of the canceled grants concerned work related to vaccine hesitancy and uptake of vaccinations, but several were on clinical development of mRNA vaccines.\nThe mRNA vaccine platform was famously deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, allowing for the creation, testing and regulatory approval of vaccines within 11 months of the sharing of the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines each contain mRNA, which instructs cells to manufacture the coronavirus spike protein, simulating infection with the virus. This induces an immune system response to the spike protein that is present on the coronavirus.\nPrior to 2020, no vaccine had ever been developed and produced so quickly, and no other existing vaccine platform can match the speed and scale of mRNA technology. These are considered crucial attributes, not only with respect to COVID-19, but also for pandemic preparedness more generally.\nHowever, Kennedy apparently sees it differently, posting on X: \u201cWe reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted. BARDA is terminating 22 mRNA vaccine development investments because the data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu. We\u2019re shifting that funding toward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear which experts Kennedy listened to, or what science he and his team reviewed. STAT News reports that vaccinologists who they spoke to say the views Kennedy expressed in the HHS statement do \u201cnot represent the scientific consensus on the utility and safety of mRNA vaccines.\u201d\nBased on the statement, this likely means a halt to all new BARDA funding of vaccine development targeting upper respiratory infections, which includes COVID-19 and influenza, but also respiratory syncytial virus and bird flu.\nHHS states that \u201cother uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted\u201d by the termination of contracts. While this may apply to BARDA, it doesn\u2019t pertain to the HHS \u201cdepartment\u201d as a whole. According to The Atlantic, partnerships between the National Institutes of Health and HIV vaccine researchers have been terminated under Kennedy\u2019s watch. The federal government is not planning to continue funding their work. Given that such disruption is occurring in the HIV space, perhaps other diseases will be affected, too. mRNA vaccines are also being developed to prevent melanoma and lung cancer, malaria, Lyme disease and Zika, as well as to protect newborns from congenital infections like cytomegalovirus.\nKennedy\u2019s moves represent the latest setback to mRNA research. While researchers Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman received a Nobel prize in 2023 for their mRNA work aimed at preventing and treating a wide range of diseases, during their decades of work they had to overcome numerous challenges.\nSince the 1960s, there was consensus around the critical role that mRNA plays as a translator of sorts in protein synthesis\u2014the process responsible for almost all cellular functions in the human body. This helical strand of molecules allows for information contained in DNA in the nucleus of cells to be delivered to ribosomes where protein synthesis can occur. However, scientists expressed doubts pertaining to the therapeutic viability of mRNA products: mRNA was considered too unstable and limited in its ability to produce an immune response.\nKarik\u00f3 and Weissman persisted in their mRNA research because they fervently believed that the platform held the future for vaccinations that could trigger the immune system to fight numerous types of diseases. They were ultimately proven right when mRNA COVID-19 vaccines successfully saved at least 2.5 million lives globally, with other estimates pointing to as many as 20 million."

      "text": "The Delta variant wave of coronavirus is sweeping over the U.S., leading to a surge in cases and Covid-19 hospitalizations. As a lagging indicator, deaths have begun to increase significantly as well, and that growth is accelerating in a number of states with particularly explosive outbreaks.\nIf the Delta wave follows a path comparable to the U.K., this could be particularly problematic in the U.S. A rapid rise in cases followed by a fast deceleration and then a rebound to a plateau at a markedly elevated level constitutes a trajectory that could be especially painful for the U.S. as autumn and winter approach.\nThe inaccurate boom and bust theory\nSome experts are suggesting that the Delta surge may quickly collapse. They point to data from other countries which indicate that the Delta-driven wave may dissipate as fast as it emerged.\nFor example, Andy Slavitt, a former advisor on resident Biden\u2019s Covid-19 response team, recently suggested that steep drop-offs in coronavirus cases took place in the U.K. and India after Delta-driven ascents, and that this could become a new \u201cparadigm for how Covid-19 spreads through communities.\u201d Slavitt asserted that the data from the U.K. and India may mean that \u201cDelta takes a quick rise [and] a quick drop\u201d in the U.S.\nThe New York Times David Leonhardt also described what he termed as the \u201cboom and bust\u201d nature of coronavirus waves, including the Delta variant, hinting that this would probably be Delta\u2019s track in the U.S. On the U.K., Leonhardt cited a chief economist at J.P. Morgan, David Mackie, who not only downplayed the impact of the Delta variant, but also offer a revisionist account: \u201cThe current Delta wave in the U.K. is turning out to be much, much milder than we anticipated.\u201d\nHere, Mackie ignores the fact that in May the consensus view among public health experts was that Britain had done such a good job vaccinating that it had built up a sufficient wall of immunity. Yet, unexpectedly, a major Delta wave hit, with, thus far, tens of thousands of hospital admissions and several thousand deaths. Vaccinations have certainly helped to blunt the impact of the Delta wave, but it\u2019s wholly inaccurate to characterize it as \u201cmuch, much milder than anticipate.\u201d\nPerhaps more importantly, the Delta wave\u2019s path isn\u2019t as simple as the peak and trough metaphor.\nIn the U.K., in June through mid July, daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 increased dramatically, from around 2,000 cases a day to more than 50,000. Several weeks ago, cases fell sharply for about 10 days, only to rebound somewhat and plateau at an elevated level of more than 25,000 cases per day. The 7-day average of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is still at least 10 times what it was at the end of May.\nIn India, where the Delta variant first emerged, confirmed Covid-19 infections rose from less than 10,000 cases a day to almost 400,000 daily infections in early May. At present, the 7-day average of cases and deaths in India is still four to five times what it was in early March and not showing any signs of decreasing further - 43,000 daily cases and approximately 550 deaths.\nU.S. Delta wave conspicuously different\nAs Delta escalates nationwide, U.S. hospitalizations have soared past the summer 2020 peak. In turn, this is having an immediate impact on hospitals, as healthcare systems are being stretched thin in many Southern states.\nIn May, very few experts projected the magnitude of the current U.S. wave. In late May, for instance, Scott Gottlieb, former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner, said that the Covid-19 pandemic would be confined to \u201csome hot spots.\u201d Even as late as the last week of June, several top experts said they did not expect the Delta variant to cause a nationwide surge in cases the U.S. like the one that occurred last winter. At the same time, they anticipated \u201clocalized outbreaks\u201d in places where vaccination rates remain low.\nClearly, the Delta wave is not confined to a few hot spots in low vaccination areas. And so, while this is now mostly a pandemic of the unvaccinated, it\u2019s not exclusively so. Highly vaccinated states are not unscathed.\nBesides, the unfolding situation in the U.S. is already worse than the U.K. In reality, what sets the U.S. apart is the fact that the Delta wave is having more of an impact in terms of hospitalizations and deaths.\nAcross all Covid-19 indicators, the numbers suggest that the U.S. is, thus far, the only wealthy, industrialized nation to see such a weak (or no) decoupling between cases and hospitalizations. The winter wave\u2019s peak of 250,000 cases per day and 125,000 hospitalizations, is remarkably similar in proportion to the current wave\u2019s ratio of 110,000 cases per day and 63,000 hospitalizations. Between cases and deaths, so far there appears to be a decoupling, but not nearly to the degree of peer nations.\nIt\u2019s too early to tell precisely which factors are responsible for the divergence between the U.S. and its peers. But, two possible causes stand out. First, a less successful (more haphazard) vaccination campaign with respect to targeting at-risk groups. Second, inadequate testing.\nThe U.S. vaccination campaign was relatively successful early on, but ran out of steam in the spring. Practically every Western nation has caught up and passed the U.S. Moreover, they\u2019ve done so by ensuring the most vulnerable are almost all protected. For example, in the U.K. more than 96% of the over 65 age group is fully vaccinated. By contrast, the figure in the U.S. is around 81%.\nThen there\u2019s the problem of testing, which has progressively gotten worse since the spring. The U.S. is now testing much less than some of its peers, like the U.K. Timely diagnosis is key to not only preventing further spread, but also providing those seriously impacted by Covid-19 with the appropriate treatment.\nAt this stage, it\u2019s unclear what will transpire in the U.S. But, supposing in the U.S. that the Delta wave follows a course analogous to the U.K., this could spell trouble. A rapid rise in cases followed by a quick decline and then a rebound to a plateau at a considerably elevated level represents a trajectory that could emerge as particularly painful for the U.S. as autumn and winter approach. In previous coronavirus waves, we observed noticeably elevated plateaus in the U.S. that evolved into major surges in June and November 2020, and a relatively minor (Alpha) wave in March 2021.\nIf subsequent to a Delta peak a period of an appreciably elevated plateau ensues in the U.S., this could pose a threat of persistent community spread that in turn could lead to more waves over time, whether in the form of the Delta variant or other variants."

      "text": "Posts mislead on Pfizer COVID vaccine\u2019s impact on transmission\nCLAIM: Pfizer admitted to the European Parliament that it had not tested the ability of its COVID-19 vaccine to prevent transmission of the virus before it entered the market, proving the company lied about this earlier in the pandemic.\nAP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: Missing context. Janine Small, president of international markets at Pfizer, told the European Parliament on Monday that Pfizer did not know whether its COVID-19 vaccine prevented transmission of the virus before it entered the market in December 2020. But Pfizer never claimed to have studied the issue before the vaccine\u2019s market release.\nTHE FACTS: After Small testified before the European Parliament\u2019s Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic, misleading claims about whether Pfizer knew the impact of its COVID-19 vaccine on preventing transmission spread widely on social media.\nRob Roos, a Dutch European Parliament member who asked Small a question about transmission at the hearing, tweeted: \u201cBREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. \u2018Get vaccinated for others\u2019 was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!\u201d\nThe tweet, which included a video showing the exchange between Roos and Small, had received more than 232,000 likes and more than 166,000 shares by Thursday.\nOther social media posts about the hearing used the hashtag #PfizerLiedPeopleDied.\nAt the hearing, Roos asked Small whether Pfizer had tested its COVID-19 vaccine for its ability to prevent transmission of the virus prior to its market release. Small answered: \u201cNo. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.\u201d She went on to explain why Pfizer moved quickly to develop a COVID-19 vaccine as the virus spread worldwide.\nWhile Roos and many others framed this as a new revelation, Pfizer never claimed that its clinical trial, upon which the vaccine was authorized for use, evaluated the shot\u2019s effect on transmission. In fact, shortly before the vaccine\u2019s release, the company\u2019s CEO emphasized that this was still being evaluated.\nA study funded by Pfizer and German vaccine maker BioNTech published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Dec. 10, 2020, a day before the Food and Drug Administration gave Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization, did not include data about the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness at reducing transmission of the virus.\nInstead, it reported that two doses of the vaccine provided 95% protection against contracting symptomatic COVID-19 in people 16 and older. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla also said in a December 2020 interview with NBC News that it was still unclear whether vaccinated individuals could carry the virus and transmit it to others.\n\u201cI think this is something that needs to be examined,\u201d he told the network. \u201cWe are not certain about that right now.\u201d\nThe FDA stated in a Dec. 11, 2020, press release announcing the authorization of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine that \u201cat this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.\u201d\nA Pfizer spokesperson told The Associated Press that its clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine in preventing disease caused by the COVID-19 virus, including severe illness.\n\u201cStopping transmission was not a study endpoint,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in an email.\nAsked for comment, Roos told the AP that he was not making a point about Pfizer, but about government mandates for the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\u201cI take fundamental rights seriously,\u201d Roos wrote in an email. \u201cFor governments to infringe on them, they need a massive amount of evidence to prove the necessity. In this case, it was not even a part of the Pfizer trials.\u201d He said that such mandates were based on \u201cno evidence.\u201d\nBut experts and research say that the COVID-19 vaccines have provided benefits in terms of limiting infections and transmission, at least with earlier variants of the virus and for a period of time after being vaccinated.\nDr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the vaccine center at Emory University, told the AP that the fact that Pfizer did not address the vaccine\u2019s impact on transmission during clinical trials is not unusual, because transmission is a complex metric to measure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult to evaluate impact on transmission,\u201d Orenstein, a professor of infectious diseases at the Emory School of Medicine, wrote in an email. \u201cWhat is usually done is a randomized placebo controlled study, in which the recipients are \u2018blinded (i.e., do not know whether they received placebo or vaccine.\u2019\u201d\nPublic officials have suggested on multiple occasions that COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission, but that\u2019s an overstatement. For example, in an October 2021 speech in Illinois, President Joe Biden said: \u201cWe\u2019re making sure healthcare workers are vaccinated, because if you seek care at a healthcare facility, you should have the certainty that\u2026the people providing that care are protected from COVID and cannot spread it to you. \u201d\nWhile the vaccines do not eliminate all transmission, they can help. Studies done after distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines began, including research by Pfizer, did find that the company\u2019s shot reduced asymptomatic infections in addition to symptomatic cases with earlier variants of the virus. Researchers in the United Kingdom reported in a February observational study that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine helped cut transmission of the alpha and delta variants.\n\u201cOur study from earlier in the year shows that the Pfizer vaccine reduces transmission from people with breakthrough infections, at least in the 3 months post vaccine which we studied,\u201d Dr. David Eyre, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study, wrote in an email.\nExperts have told the AP that while the original COVID-19 vaccines provide less protection against infection with the highly contagious omicron variant, they still protect against serious outcomes.\nThe CDC stated in an August report that receiving only the first one or two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cprovides minimal protection against infection and transmission\u201d and that being up to date on all recommended booster doses \u201cprovides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time.\u201d\nDr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, explained that while the vaccines do provide neutralizing antibodies, which help protect against infection, those kinds of antibodies quickly wane \u2014 even as protection against serious illness continues to last.\n\u201cIt is fair to say that when you get a vaccine that clearly decreases your chance of getting infected, it does,\u201d said Offit, who is also the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cAnd therefore it decreases your chance of spreading it to others. But it\u2019s not in any way absolute.\u201d\nOffit added that messaging to the public around the vaccines early on was flawed and should have been focused on their core benefit \u2014 preventing serious illness and hospitalization \u2014 since many would later cast doubt on the vaccines\u2019 success because of \u201cbreakthrough infections.\u201d\n___\nThis is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

A groundbreaking worldwide study led by researchers from Universit\u00e0 Cattolica and Stanford University reveals that most lives were saved before individuals were exposed to the virus, particularly during the Omicron period and among those aged 60+.

The 82% of the lives saved by vaccines involved people vaccinated before encountering the virus, 57% during the Omicron period, and 90% involved people aged 60 years and older. In all, vaccines have saved 14.8 million years of life (one year of life saved for 900 doses of vaccine administered).\nThese are some of the data released in an unprecedented study published in the journal Jama Health Forum and coordinated by Prof. Stefania Boccia, Stefania Boccia, Professor of General and Applied Hygiene at Universit\u00e0 Cattolica, with contributions from Dr. Angelo Maria Pezzullo, Researcher in General and Applied Hygiene, and Dr. Antonio Cristiano, a medical resident in Hygiene and Preventive Medicine.

Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life years saved) and young adults aged 20-29 (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life years saved) contributed very little to the total benefit.\nProfessor Boccia concludes: \"These estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations that focused mainly on the first year of vaccination, but clearly demonstrate an important overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination over the period 2020-2024. Most of the benefits, in terms of lives and life-years saved, have been secured for a portion of the global population who is typically more fragile, the elderly.\"\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.

      "text": "Abstract\nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 100 million people globally within the first year of the pandemic. With a death toll surpassing 500,000 in the United States alone, containing the pandemic is predicated on achieving herd immunity on a global scale. This implies that at least 70-80 % of the population must achieve active immunity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), either as a result of a previous COVID-19 infection or by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In December 2020, the first two vaccines were approved by the FDA through emergency use authorization in the United States. These vaccines are based on the mRNA vaccine platform and were developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Published safety and efficacy trials reported high efficacy rates of 94-95 % after two interval doses, in conjunction with limited side effects and a low rate of adverse reactions. The rapid pace of vaccine development and the uncertainty of potential long-term adverse effects raised some level of hesitation against mRNA vaccines in the global community. A successful vaccination campaign is contingent on widespread access to the vaccine under appropriate storage conditions, deployment of a sufficient number of vaccinators, and the willingness of the population to be vaccinated. Thus, it is important to clarify the objective data related to vaccine safety, including known side effects and potential adverse reactions. The present review was designed to provide an update on the current state of science related to the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nBackground\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) represents a highly contagious respiratory virus that is responsible for the current worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [1]. Currently, there have been over 30 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States, with reported deaths of more than half a million people at the time of the drafting of this article (www.cdc.gov). Due to the serious implications of this pandemic, a scientific focus on vaccine development for COVID-19 has been the forefront of a global initiative to combat this virus [2,3,4].\nHistory of vaccines\nThe establishment of vaccines represents a vital instrument in reducing rates of infections and diseases globally [5]. The original premise of vaccination, dating back to the eleventh century, was human exposure to a small amount of a disease, to promote protection and immunity against subsequent exposure of a larger quantity of the same pathogen [6]. This was first recorded in Chinese literature, whereby ingesting small amounts of poison could prevent potential fatality of a larger poison dose [7, 8]. Furthering these basic principles of vaccination, research conducted by Louis Pasteur in the 19th century resulted in the discovery of attenuated pathogens that were inoculated into a subject, in order to prevent a potential ensuing infection when exposed to the same pathogen [9]. A significant aspect of this discovery was the ability to attenuate a pathogen [10]. This provided the ability to inject a pathogen that would result in limited adverse effects, elicit an immune response to develop protection, and prevent contraction of the disease [11].\nVaccine development has persisted into the modern day, and while based on the same principles, the methods of antigen introduction have evolved [12]. The vaccine platform introduced by Pasteur is still highly relevant to current vaccine research, but an array of new vaccine platforms are available in the modern day [13]. Current vaccine platforms include: live-attenuated, inactivated, toxoid, subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, conjugate, and the most recent platform; mRNA vaccines [14]. All of these mechanisms of vaccination have ultimately derived from the basic principles that were uncovered hundreds of years ago [15]. A summary of historical landmarks in vaccine development is shown in Table 1.\nThe mRNA vaccine platform\nThe concept of mRNA vaccines has been scientifically relevant since the early 21st century, however, the development of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines presents the initial, large scale, application of this type of inoculation [16]. Previous platforms have utilized similar mechanisms of vaccination by exposing a subject to a pathogen, or a specific aspect of a pathogen, such as a sugar or capsid. However, mRNA vaccines provide a novel and alternative approach to providing pathogen immunity [17]. Messenger RNA vaccines provide the genetic code of the pathogen\u2019s relevant antigen. This messenger RNA is then translated by the host to form the relevant protein from the pathogen being studied. In other words, the vaccine provides the cells with a blueprint to construct the protein [18]. This process allows the host to mount an immune response against the constructed foreign protein [18]. The cells then destroy the blueprint, the injected mRNA, following the development of the protein [18]. The half-life of the mRNA is short and remains in human tissues for just a few days [19]. The immune response elicits the production of antibodies, which allows the body to develop a certain degree of immunity against the specific pathogen [20]. A similar immune response would be generated through natural contraction of COVID-19, but with the mRNA vaccine, the body will not be required to endure the actual exposure to the pathogen, while still mounting an immune response [21]. A common misconception is that mRNA vaccines represent a new vaccine platform developed to combat COVID-19. Whereas, mRNA vaccines have been designed and developed for years against other pathogens, such as ebola, zika, rabies, influenza, and cytomegalovirus [22, 23].\nWhen specifically applying the mRNA vaccine platform to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1), it is crucial to understand the specific mRNA vaccine mechanism [24, 25]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the mRNA provides the genetic blueprint for the spike protein of COVID-19 [26]. Specifically, the vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA vaccine that encodes the perfusion stabilized full-length spike protein [2]. Lipid nanoparticles \u2013 which are the most commonly utilized vectors for in vivo RNA delivery \u2013 shelter mRNA from degradation, and mediate endocytosis and endosomal escape [27]. Positively charged lipid nanoparticles help bring mRNA to the negatively charged cell membranes, facilitating subsequent cytoplasmic endocytosis. For the mRNA to be transcribed, it must escape both the lipid nanoparticle as well as the endosome [28]. The immune cells then display the spike protein on their surface and break down the instructions to build the spike protein that was provided by the mRNA vaccine (Fig. 2). The immune system recognizes that this protein is foreign and instructs the immune system to develop antibodies against COVID-19 [24]. This mechanism provides the immune system with protection against subsequent infection and bypasses risks associated with injecting the actual pathogen into the body, whether alive or attenuated [5, 7].\nClinical trials\nDevelopment of a vaccine to combat COVID-19 has been of paramount importance since the onset of the pandemic [2]. The scope of this review focuses on the safety and efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer/ BioNTech mRNA vaccines exclusively. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2) trial reported that the vaccine had 95 % efficacy [29]. The trial enlisted a total of 43,548 adult volunteers, with half of the participants receiving a placebo injection, and the other half receiving the actual vaccine. One hundred seventy people contracted COVID-19 in both groups: 8 of these participants were in the vaccine group, and the other 162 participants were in the placebo group. Ten of the 170 cases were classified as severe, and 9 out of the 10 severe cases were among participants in the placebo group [29].\nThe Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273) trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers, with half of the participants received the vaccine, while the other half received the placebo [30]. Of the 15,210 participants in the placebo group, 185 contracted COVID-19 compared to 11 participants that contracted the virus in the vaccine group. These results demonstrated 94.1 % efficacy of the vaccine [30]. At the time of drafting this article, the efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines against novel mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and is subject for further investigation.\nSafety considerations\nCommon side effects\nAs of publication of this review, there have been no serious side effects identified in the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials for both the Moderna and Pfzier/BioNTech mRNA vaccines [29, 30]. Mild local side effects including heat, pain, redness, and swelling are more common with the vaccines than with the placebo (normal saline) [29, 30]. Other systemic side effects including fatigue, fever, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias occur more frequently with the vaccine than with placebo, with most occurring within 1 to 2 days following vaccination [29, 30]. Hypersensitivity adverse side effects were equivalently reported in both the placebo and vaccine groups in both trials [31]. As reported, a two-dose regimen of the mRNA vaccines resulted in 94-95 % protection against COVID-19 in people ages 16 and older, and over a median of 2 months, safety of the vaccine was comparable to that of other viral vaccines [29, 30].\nLocal reactions\nThe initial published trials on mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 reported more local reactions in the recipients of the vaccine compared to the control group receiving placebo [29, 30]. The most common local reaction was pain at the injection site within one week of vaccination. The majority of the local reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity and lasted between 24 and 48 h [29, 30]. Across all age groups, less than 1 % of participants reported severe pain and pain of any kind was reported less commonly among participants over the age of 55 years [29, 30].\nSystemic reactions\nIn the same trials, the younger vaccine recipients (between 16 and 55 years of age) reported systemic events more frequently than their older counterparts (over 55 years of age) [29, 30]. This higher incidence of systemic events may represent a more robust immune response in younger individuals compared to the older population. More side effects were reported following the second vaccine dose compared to the first dose [29, 30]. Following the second dose, fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported side effects. However, these side effects were also reported by a large number of control patients in the placebo group [29, 30]. The incidence of systemic side effects was less than 1 % following the first vaccine dose and less than 2 % following the second dose, with the exception of fatigue (3.8 %) and headaches (2.0 %) [29, 30]. Following the first dose, only 0.2 % of vaccine recipients and 0.1 % of placebo recipients reported fever up to 40 \u00b0C. Following the second dose, 0.8 % of vaccine recipients and 0.1 % of placebo recipients reposted fever up to 40 \u00b0C. Temperatures above 40 \u00b0C were reported by two individuals each in the vaccine and placebo groups. Systemic events including chills and fever resolved within 24 to 48 h post-vaccination [29, 30].\nAdverse events\nAdverse events were more commonly reported among vaccine recipients (27 %) compared to the placebo group (12 %) [29, 30]. These ratios are largely attributable to variations in transient reactogenicity events that were reported more frequently in the vaccine group. Related serious adverse events were reported by four vaccine recipients (vaccine administration-related shoulder injury, right axillary lymphadenopathy, paroxysmal ventricular arrhythmia, and right leg paresthesia). Two vaccine recipients died (one from arteriosclerosis, one from cardiac arrest) compared to four fatalities in the placebo group (one from hemorrhagic stroke, one from myocardial infarction, and two from unknown causes). None of the deaths were found by the investigators to be connected to the vaccine or placebo. Furthermore, no COVID-19-associated mortalities were observed, and no halting rules criteria were met during the reporting period. Following administration of the second dose of vaccine, safety monitoring is planned to continue for 2 years [29, 30]. Recent data suggest the incidence of anaphylaxis episodes attributable to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine occured in roughly 1:200,000 individuals [29]. This rate lies in sharp contrast to the rate of less than 1 per million doses for most vaccines. The causative antigen and associated mechanisms remain under investigation, although polyethylene glycol has been proposed as the potential culprit [32]. The Pfizer/BioNTech anaphylaxis events have been responsive to epinephrine treatment, although many cases required more than one dose of epinephrine [33]. Both the Pfizer/BioNtech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines had associated orofacial and oculofacial side effects [34]. These observed adverse events were rare (around 1:1,000) and included facial, labial, and glossal edema [34]. Acute, temporary, unilateral peripheral facial paralysis (Bell\u2019s palsy, an idiopathic palsy of cranial nerve VII) was also reported [34]. This adverse event pertained to individuals who had previously undergone facial cosmetic injections [34] or to people with a known history of Bell\u2019s palsy [35]. A summary of the common side effects, major adverse events and speculated complications is shown in Table 2.\nAt\u2010risk populations\nOlder adults\nThe most commonly reported side effects associated with the vaccine among those over the age of 55 years old were chills, headache, injection site pain, fatigue, and myalgias [36]. A higher incidence of local and systemic reactions was reported following the second vaccine dose [29, 30]. Symptoms usually arose within 24 h of the vaccination and resolved quickly. Mild erythema lasting between 5 and 7 days was reported by three participants. Myalgia lasting 5 days that began on day 3 post-vaccination was reported by one participant. Only two systemic adverse events that were classified as severe took place following the second dose: one participant between 56 and 70 years old in the 25-\u00b5g dose subgroup reported a fever and another participant over the age of 70 in the 100-\u00b5g dose subgroup reported fatigue [37]. Out of the 71 adverse events reported, 17 were considered by the investigators to be associated with the vaccine. All of these adverse events were classified as mild except for one \u201cmoderate\u201d case of decreased appetite reported by a participant between 56 and 70 years old in the 25-\u00b5g dose subgroup. One severe case of hypoglycemia (glucose level, 50 mg per deciliter; reference range, 65 to 99 mg per deciliter) by a participant between 56 and 70 years old in the 100-\u00b5g dose subgroup after fasting and engaging in vigorous exercise. This complication was deemed by the investigators as not being related to the vaccine [37].\nPregnant women\nThere is limited data regarding the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during pregnancy. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that about 25 % of women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years of age) hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1 and August 22, 2020 were pregnant, and that pregnant women tended to require mechanical ventilation more than their nonpregnant counterparts [38]. The CDC also indicates that women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy are at a greater risk for preterm birth [38]. Among the infants born to SARS-CoV-2 infected women with known gestational, 12.9 % were preterm (< 37 weeks), compared to a national estimate of 10.2 % [39]. Endocrinological, immunological, and physical gestational changes place pregnant women and their fetuses at increased risk for significant complications caused by infectious diseases, which is not unique to COVID-19 [40]. The Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines currently approved through emergency use authorization (EUA) do not utilize an adjuvant and are not live vaccines [29, 30]. Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) recommend that these vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant and breastfeeding women [41]. Nevertheless, none of the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been tested for efficacy, immunogenicity, reactogenicity, or safety in pregnant women to date [41]. Results of the Pfizer-BioNtech mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine demonstrate a broad immune response to the vaccine including stimulation of neutralizing antibody responses, stimulation of CD4 + cells, and growth of effector memory CD8 + T cells in men and in nonpregnant women [42]. It is not known if an equivalent immunological response can be expected in pregnant women. These data raise apprehensions because favorable perinatal outcomes depend a great deal upon amplified helper T cell type 2 and regulatory T cell activity coupled with decreased Th1 responses. Alteration of CD4 + T cell responses during pregnancy is related to unfavorable pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and fetal loss [43]. Moreover, some evidence suggests that babies born to mothers with variant CD4 + T cell responses may suffer enduring adverse consequences [44].\nUntil present, the FDA has not issued any explicit guidelines regarding the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women. Rather, the FDA refers to pregnant women in the EUA letters and factsheets provided to healthcare providers for the individual vaccines. The EUA letters for both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines contain provisions obliging post-authorization observational studies and label pregnant women as a \u201cpopulation of interest\u201d for these studies, citing a lack of data regarding vaccine risk in pregnancy. The Moderna vaccine fact sheet specifically alludes to a reproductive toxicity study in female rats; adverse effects on fetal development, female fertility, and early offspring development were assessed, with no adverse outcomes observed. The Moderna vaccine also has a pregnancy exposure registry intended to monitor pregnancy outcomes in women who received the vaccine during pregnancy. To date, neither Moderna nor Pfizer have issued guidelines or guidance regarding their vaccines and pregnancy [41]. The aforementioned concerns notwithstanding, recent data indicate \u201cno difference in the composite primary outcome of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, and cesarean delivery for fetal indication among women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed during pregnancy\u201d (52 women [21 %] vs. 684 women [23 %]; relative risk, 0.94; 95 % CI, 0.73\u20131.21; P = .64). There were also no stillbirths among women with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy [45].\nImmunocompromised patients\nCurrent evidence suggests that both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines elicit a strong humoral response due to the production of neutralizing antibodies coupled with a robust cellular response by inducing functional and pro-inflammatory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and expression of Th1 cytokines [46]. Notably, the initial vaccine trials excluded immunocompromised patients, including those on immunosuppressive medications and patients with autoimmune conditions [29, 30]. This population requires special consideration because infections are amongst the most frequent causes of death in them. Notwithstanding, data from the COVID-19 rheumatology registry thus far has not demonstrated an augmented risk of COVID-19 complications in immunocompromised patients with the exception of patients taking moderate or high doses of corticosteroids [47]. On top of the undetermined effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in these patients, there are various other unanswered inquiries regarding vaccinations in patients on immunosuppressive agents [46,47,48]. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are known to mount an attenuated immune response to vaccinations and therefore require special consideration for COVID-19 vaccines [42]. Because this patient population was not included in the initial trials, the immunological effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines remains unknown [29, 30]. Healthcare providers may consider holding immunosuppressive therapy for two weeks post-vaccination until future clinical trials will provide further scientific guidance [47]. For both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, the only advisory provided by the FDA for immunocompromised patients is the possibility of moderated response to the vaccine. The CDC states that immunocompromised patients may obtain the vaccines provided they have no contraindications to vaccination, but that they should be advised about the undetermined efficacy and safety profiles of the vaccines in immunocompromised populations [47].\nDiscussion\nIndividual immunological status and circumstantial considerations notwithstanding, the available evidence appears to favor vaccination with either the Moderna or the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines for the majority of the population. The vaccination program\u2019s effectiveness depends upon convincing efficacy and safety data coupled with popular public acceptance and inoculation [49]. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a noteworthy challenge in the United States [50]. Much of this hesitancy has stemmed from a relatively abbreviated clinical trial process; despite the swift timeline, patients and providers should bear in mind that these vaccines went through the appropriate due diligence, just like prior vaccines. The CDC also continues to closely monitor these vaccines for safety and efficacy. Furthermore, United States federal government and industry partners had constructed vaccine manufacturing facilities ahead of time prior to vaccine approval. Usually, vaccine manufacturers do not build such facilities until phase 3 has been completed [51].\nVaccine hesitancy has been described as a \u201clack of confidence in vaccination and/or complacency about vaccination\u201d that may result in deferment or failure to vaccinate in spite of accessible services [50]. The swift vaccine development timelines for the COVID-19 vaccines in particular, combined with the highly divided socio-political landscape, may further compromise vaccination confidence and escalate complacency regarding vaccination [50]. Impressive declines in new-onset COVID-19 infection rates following vaccine dissemination in special populations, e.g. nursing home residents, have highlighted the importance of widespread immunization. Implementation of comprehensive evidence-based efforts targeted at behavior change is necessary to address ongoing vaccine hesitancy. Recent studies reveal vaccine hesitancy and ambivalence in a significant percentage of the public [52]. These surveys further suggest that vaccine hesitancy is more pronounced in populations who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, including unemployed individuals and those with lower educational levels, as well as among certain racial minority groups including African Americans and Hispanic Americans [53, 54].\nIn order to address vaccine hesitancy and enhance COVID-19 vaccine adoption, multi-tiered, evidenced-based approaches must be implemented. They include evidence-based initiatives from behavioral, communication, implementation, and social sciences that can guide clinical programs at the organizational, relational, and individual levels to support public health initiatives and challenge COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [50]. Important vaccine education platforms include; websites, television, educational programs in school, and vaccine education initiatives to serve areas with limited technological connection. Effective strategies to increase vaccine adoption include implementing vaccination programs for the following: schools and colleges, woman-infant programs, and indigent areas that have less geographic access to vaccination centers [55]. Although it has been noted that children are at lower risk of adverse effects, vaccination among this population remains crucial to limiting the spread of COVID-19 and achieving herd immunity. Healthcare provider endorsement has been shown to result in increased adoption of a variety of preventive healthcare activities including vaccinations. Healthcare professionals are regarded as the most trusted sources of information, generally and specifically regarding COVID-19. Clear and assertive recommendations from healthcare providers may mitigate concerns about safety and enhance vaccine adoption [56]. Evidence suggests that individual-level strategies in the absence of other initiatives remain largely ineffective. However, when used as an adjunct to community-based and interpersonal initiatives, individual approaches can promote vaccination rates and enhance initiatives aimed at reducing hesitancy [57]. Moreover, providers must be aware of the crucial role of the vaccine in the prevention of COVID-19 in the individual and population levels. The development of various vaccines with different dosing schedules and storage needs underscores the need for effective and consistent communication and logistical standards. Healthcare providers must therefore be equipped with training and resources for making strong recommendations and attending to vaccine hesitancy [50]. Development and distribution of consistent, culturally sensitive, and straightforward patient education materials in tandem with other evidence-based strategies can increase vaccination rates [58]. This strategy can be bolstered by drawing upon communication science data, such as positively framed messages and appealing to altruism and prosocial behavior to increase adoption [59].\nNotably, a recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 29 % of healthcare providers themselves expressed hesitancy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The same survey found that among the general public, the group that reported that they \u201cdefinitely will not get vaccinated\u201d may be the hardest to reach via most traditional public health means. Only two emissaries were reported as trustworthy sources by at least half the people in this group: their personal health care provider (59 %) and former President Trump (56 %). These findings suggest that individual health care provider endorsement and support may be one of the sole avenues for reaching this group with reliable and timely vaccine information [60].\nPractical limitations oblige organizations to choose from the available evidence-based approaches to identify strategies that are achievable and sufficient within their particular circumstances and settings. Initiatives designed to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccination must therefore be chosen and customized to conform to the specific needs and resources of clinical environments and to tackle recognized obstacles to adoption. Thus, healthcare organizations must assess local contexts in order to appreciate pertinent roadblocks and resources. Moreover, framing initiatives within iterative assessment approaches can aid in effectively identifying and amending the appropriate strategies over time.\nConclusions\nThe current data suggests that the currently approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for the vast majority of the population. Furthermore, broad-based vaccine uptake is critical for achieving herd immunity; an essential factor in decreasing future surges of COVID-19 infections. Ensuring sufficient COVID-19 vaccination adoption by the public will involve attending to the rising vaccine hesitancy among a pandemic-weary population. Evidence-based approaches at the federal, state, city, and organizational levels are necessary to improve vaccination efforts and to decrease hesitancy. Educating the general public about the safety of the current and forthcoming vaccines is of vital consequence to public health and ongoing and future large-scale vaccination initiatives.\nAvailability of data and materials\nPlease contact the authors for data requests.\nChange history\n18 May 2021\nA Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13037-021-00296-4\nReferences\nWiersinga WJ, Rhodes A, Cheng AC, Peacock SJ, Prescott HC.

      "text": "Two years into the Covid-19 pandemic, it\u2019s easy to lament all that has come to pass. The devastating losses. The upending of what we regarded as normal ways of life. The sheer relentlessness of it all.\nBut let\u2019s stop for a moment and consider something else that may have escaped you: You have witnessed \u2014 and you are a beneficiary of \u2014 a freaking miracle.\nThat miracle is the development, testing, manufacturing, and global distribution of Covid vaccines.\nIf you\u2019re reading this article, it\u2019s a safe bet that you\u2019ve been vaccinated. You may even have had three doses. Many of your family members, friends, colleagues, neighbors, even strangers you pass on the street are probably in the same boat. At this point if they aren\u2019t vaccinated and boosted, it\u2019s by choice.\nYes, the global rollout has been shamefully inequitable, with low-income countries having to wait far too long to be able to protect their citizens. Sub-Saharan African countries, in particular, still struggle to access and distribute vaccine.\nBut at least 55% of the people inhabiting this planet have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. In affluent parts of the world, anybody who believes in the protective powers of vaccines has had the opportunity to be vaccinated for months now. (The sole exception: children under the age of 5, for whom the vaccines are not yet authorized.) And it isn\u2019t just wealthy countries. Colombia, Morocco, Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Mongolia, and Tonga have fully vaccinated about the same proportion of their populations \u2014 roughly 64% \u2014 as has the United States.\nWhat has been accomplished in the 25 months since Chinese scientists first shared the genetic sequence of the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus has defied the predictions of the most optimistic prognosticators.\n\u201cIn one year, half the species vaccinated \u2014 wow!\u201d said Eric Topol, the founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, referring to the period after which vaccines started to become available. He has been marveling on his well-followed Twitter feed about how lucky the world got with Covid vaccines; he calls them \u201can extraordinary human achievement.\u201d\nTopol was among the skeptics in early March of 2020 when Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a Senate committee that it would take at least 12 to 18 months to develop a Covid vaccine. \u201cI thought it was a fantasy. Total fantasy,\u201d he told STAT in a recent interview.\nEight months after Fauci made that prediction, the United States started vaccinating with Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s messenger RNA vaccine, and a week later, with Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccine. At 18 months, the outside edge of Fauci\u2019s estimate, the U.S. had already administered nearly 400 million doses of vaccine. Roughly 56% of the population was fully vaccinated by that point and administration of third doses had already begun.\nTrue, the mRNA vaccines haven\u2019t lived up to their initial billing, when they were shown to block roughly 95% of all infections. Over time, that level of protection against all infections declines. Still, they have fundamentally altered the threat SARS-2 poses. Most people who have received three doses are shielded from serious disease and death, even in the face of Omicron, which is so different from the vaccine strain some experts are puzzled at why protection against severe disease remains so strong.\nConsider for a moment what might have happened without these vaccines.\nAccording to modeling conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, 1.1 million additional Americans would have died from Covid \u2014 and that estimate was made based on data from before the massive Omicron wave that has swept across the country in past two months.\n\u201cWe would have been broken,\u201d said Topol. \u201cRight now, we have a death toll of around 2,500 people a day. \u2026 Imagine what we would have with no vaccination.\u201d\nThe miracle was based on a solid foundation\nThe scientists and public policy folk among you are probably bristling at the use of the \u201cM\u201d word. This isn\u2019t a miracle, you\u2019re likely grumbling, but the fruit of years of planning and research and major investments in science. The National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and other national and international funders have strived for years to get the world ready to respond to a pandemic.\nIt is true that we are reaping the benefits of all that, as well as of the $18 billion that Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration\u2019s program to kick-start the development of Covid vaccines and drugs, poured into the effort. That infusion of cash at a critical time helped companies embark on risky projects that could well \u2014 and in some cases did \u2014 fail.\n\u201cTrump has lots of warts,\u201d said Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cBut he did support a rapid acceleration of the program and should get some credit for it. Without that rapid acceleration in investment, we wouldn\u2019t have had this in time and a lot more people would have died.\u201d\nBut even with all of that, there was no guarantee the world would be where it is today \u2014 and many reasons to believe it wouldn\u2019t be. Up until Covid, after all, the fastest vaccine ever to be developed \u2014 the one for mumps \u2014 took four years.\nAt the beginning of this pandemic, Richard Hatchett, who heads CEPI and who has worked on pandemic response planning since 2005, dug as deeply as he could into what was recorded about how the legendary vaccinologist Maurice Hilleman managed to develop the mumps vaccine. He learned it took two years for Hilleman to even start conducting clinical trials.\nIf Covid vaccines had taken as long as the mumps vaccine to develop, the world would have had to face the Delta and Omicron waves with the vast majority of people on the planet armor-less against the virus that causes Covid.\nInstead, it took just 66 days after the SARS-2 sequence was published for scientists at the NIH to begin enrolling people in a Phase 1 clinical trial of Moderna\u2019s Covid vaccine. The first injection occurred on March 16, 2020.\n\u201cThe previous fastest vaccine ever developed \u2026 would just be entering into the clinic now. And we\u2019ve delivered 11 billion doses,\u201d Hatchett noted. \u201cThat\u2019s how much we\u2019ve moved the needle.\u201d\n\u201cThe previous fastest vaccine ever developed \u2026 would just be entering into the clinic now. And we\u2019ve delivered 11 billion doses. That\u2019s how much we\u2019ve moved the needle.\u201d\nRichard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI\nSome of it was luck. Scientists had been toiling for over a decade trying to figure out the right construct for coronavirus vaccines, work that was spurred by the 2003 SARS-1 epidemic and outbreaks from 2012 onward caused by a cousin virus, MERS, that jumps sporadically from camels to people on the Arabian Peninsula. It was clear coronaviruses, which originate in bats, were promiscuous enough that the world needed to be ready for more such incursions.\n\u201cFor whatever reason, we had just the right information and had just the right partnerships and all the right things in place to do something for a coronavirus,\u201d said Barney Graham, who with his team at the NIAID\u2019s Vaccine Research Center and Jason McLellan of the University of Texas at Austin, designed the spike protein target that a number of vaccine manufacturers used to make their Covid vaccines.\nThe coronavirus vaccine research gave the world a head start when SARS-2 reared its head. \u201cWhen the sequence was published, we knew how to modify it immediately because of what we\u2019ve done a dozen times on other coronaviruses,\u201d he said. Had the pandemic been triggered by a virus belonging to a less well-studied family, the world might still be waiting for vaccines.\n\u201cFor some of the other virus families the design of the antigen is not as generalizable as we have found it for coronavirus,\u201d said Graham, who retired from the Vaccine Research Center last August.\nA lot of the pandemic preparedness funding went into developing different ways to make vaccines, methods that are less cumbersome or time-consuming, say, than the approach used to make influenza vaccines, which involves growing viruses in eggs. For Rick Bright, it came down to a simple mantra: \u201cMore, better, faster.\u201d\nBright was the head of BARDA at the outset of the pandemic. At the time, the agency was providing funding to Cambridge, Mass.-based Moderna, whose messenger RNA approach was promising but had never been used in a licensed vaccine. In early 2020, Bright thought a Covid mRNA vaccine was a long shot, and that a more established platform \u2014 the viral-vectored vaccine being developed by Johnson & Johnson \u2014 was a more likely bet.\n\u201cI thought that would be our first vaccine. And the mRNA, if it worked, would be great, but I had my doubts because it had never scaled,\u201d he said, referring to the fact that it\u2019s one thing to design a vaccine and another entirely to learn, on the fly, how to produce it at commercial scale. \u201cIt was truly a Hail Mary pass with mRNA.\u201d\n\u201cI would have to say at the outset I would not have thought we\u2019d be here by now, given the technology,\u201d admitted Bright, who left the federal government early in the pandemic in a dispute with the Trump administration. He now heads the Pandemic Prevention Institute at the Rockefeller Foundation.\nIt could have been different. It would have been, if it had been flu\nThe scope of what has been achieved comes into clearer focus when it is compared to what happened in 2009, during the last pandemic, caused by an influenza virus called H1N1.\nMultiple vaccine manufacturers produce somewhere in the order of 1.5 billion doses of flu vaccine every year. When the new virus emerged, there were plans in place for making vaccine that wouldn\u2019t require the large-scale clinical trials Covid vaccines had to undergo. The new virus would replace old flu vaccine viruses, small studies would be conducted, and the world would start to vaccinate.\nBut, as is often the case with flu vaccine, there was a glitch. The viruses for the vaccine, produced in hen\u2019s eggs, didn\u2019t grow well initially. \u201cEven if you yell at them, they don\u2019t grow faster,\u201d Tom Frieden, then-director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, famously said in October of 2009, when cases in the U.S. were surging but vaccine doses were scarce. By the time vaccine was ready, the fall wave was already receding.\nCountries with domestic production or pre-existing pandemic flu vaccine contracts pledged to donate 10% of their doses, from the point when they started to take delivery, to a pool from which the World Health Organization would redistribute it to countries without access to vaccine.\nHatchett, who worked in the Obama White House during the H1N1 pandemic and was overseeing the donations work, said by the time the vaccine redistribution effort wound down in the autumn of 2010, 78 million donated doses of vaccine had been distributed to 77 countries.\nIn the same time frame during this pandemic, the COVAX facility \u2014 an entity for vaccine sharing set up by the WHO, CEPI, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance \u2014 had sent 1 billion doses of vaccine to 144 countries. Not as much as it had planned, not as much as the world needed. And yet: Countries that needed help accessing Covid vaccine got 1 billion doses before the second anniversary of the WHO\u2019s declaration of the pandemic.\nHad the second pandemic of the 21st century been triggered by a virulent flu virus, scaling up of vaccine production likely wouldn\u2019t have happened anywhere near as fast as it has with Covid vaccines. The fact that there were no coronavirus vaccines in production forced manufacturers to innovate, to move to new platforms. There wouldn\u2019t have been the same innovation pressure with a new flu virus.\n\u201cWe would have pressed hard on egg-based production. And it\u2019s not extensible and it doesn\u2019t scale,\u201d Hatchett said.\nKathleen Neuzil, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland Medical School and a co-lead of the clinical trials arm of Operation Warp Speed, worked for years on flu pandemic planning.\nThe best-case scenario, she thought, was that the world would be able to produce between 4 billion and 8 billion doses of flu vaccine in a year, with the stars having to align perfectly to get to 8 billion. The stars never align perfectly with flu vaccine production.\n\u201cPeople [believe] COVAX has been a terrible failure because it didn\u2019t hit the 2 billion dose target. And it didn\u2019t, and we\u2019re disappointed,\u201d Hatchett said. \u201cBut delivering a billion doses in 13 months relative to any historic example or any comparable experience with trying to move new medical products to create global equity \u2014 that\u2019s clearly unprecedented.\u201d\nAmanda Glassman agrees. Last week she and colleagues from the Center for Global Development published a report on the Covid vaccine effort that compares it to previous global health endeavors, including the smallpox eradication campaign and the rollout of childhood vaccination programs worldwide. The report does not gloss over the Covid effort\u2019s shortcomings for low-income countries. But it does shine a light on its successes in middle-income nations.\n\u201cLook at the curves on the delivery of doses and it\u2019s so close in time to what was happening in high-income countries,\u201d Glassman said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s still an income gradient but that income gradient is over a period of weeks and months, not years and decades.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been just an enormous amount of negative coverage on the global vaccine rollout effort. Much of the criticism is entirely merited but it lost the big-picture perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is actually the most important public health program or effort in history.\u201d\nThis happened despite the fact that the giants stumbled\nThe enormity of these achievements becomes even more impressive when you consider this: Three of the four largest Western vaccine manufacturers \u2014 Merck, Sanofi, and GSK \u2014 have not contributed a vaccine to these efforts. (Sanofi is still trying.)\nBefore the pandemic, those three companies and Pfizer were the world\u2019s largest vaccine producers, measured by sales; they controlled 90% of global vaccine value.\nGSK, with vaccine sales in 2019 that were more than double those of its fellow giants, didn\u2019t even attempt to produce a Covid vaccine. Instead, it offered to let others use its AS03 adjuvant, which boosts the potency of a vaccine dose. Merck tried two approaches and, after both failed, folded. Sanofi had an early setback and is still testing its vaccine, which uses GSK\u2019s adjuvant. The company hopes to get its product authorized later this spring.\nAnyone plotting out pandemic responses has to factor in the inevitability that some of the vaccine efforts will fail. No one planning pandemic responses would have anticipated the world could be where it is now with three of the four biggest vaccine manufacturers effectively standing on the sidelines. (All three have made batches of vaccines for competitors as a contribution to the effort.)\nGSK, Sanofi, and Merck have since scrambled to buy into the messenger RNA business, the production platform Pfizer rode to such great success. \u201cThey aren\u2019t reaping the rewards of those who set the level of their ambition higher and who took risks and who innovated in their process for vaccine development,\u201d Hatchett said bluntly.\nWe mustn\u2019t take this for granted\nDespite the amazing progress that has been made in vaccinating the world against Covid, it\u2019s hard to get people to crow about it. The failure to hit targets for distribution of vaccine to low-income countries and the inadequate levels of vaccine uptake in some countries \u2014 including the United States \u2014 have people focusing on what hasn\u2019t been achieved, not what has.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to celebrate when we\u2019re still in such a mess,\u201d said Graham, who is a proponent of developing vaccine production capacity in all regions of the world, so that places like Africa don\u2019t have to wait for vaccine donations from wealthy countries next time.\nThere is also a fear that people will assume the next time will be easier or even more successful, that what happened with Covid will lead to complacency.\n\u201cI think the danger is that the world interprets what has been done as just something that we\u2019re positioned to do, whatever the future threat is,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is \u2026 we\u2019re not.\u201d\nHe noted that all the Western vaccines that have succeeded were made using platforms that scientists had been working on for some time, things like AstraZeneca\u2019s and J&J\u2019s viral-vectored vaccines, Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines, and Novavax\u2019s protein vaccine. We cannot assume, Hatchett said, that just because these platforms work well for coronavirus vaccines, they will work as well for all future threats. Likewise, we should not suppose that scientists will succeed as quickly as Graham and colleagues did at devising a vaccine target for the cause of a future outbreak.\n\u201cIf we want to be able to respond even as well as we did to Covid, then we have to make those investments in R&D going forward,\u201d Hatchett said. \u201cBut people don\u2019t understand that. That nuance is completely lost.\u201d\nWe need to worry about next time. But we also need to recognize what happened this time. And that is a miracle.\nSaid Anna Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated that, given the resources, you can develop, evaluate, produce, and distribute a totally novel vaccine to hundreds of millions, if not billions of people, given a huge effort and extensive financial resources.\u201d\nTo submit a correction request, please visit our Contact Us page."

      "text": "\u201cNeoliberalism\u201d has been called a political swear word, and it gets blamed for pretty much every socioeconomic ill we have, from bank failures and income inequality to the gig economy and demagogic populism. Yet for forty years neoliberalism was the principal economic doctrine of the American government. Is that what has landed us in the mess we\u2019re in?\nWhat\u2019s \u201cneo\u201d about neoliberalism is really what\u2019s retro about it. It\u2019s confusing, because in the nineteen-thirties the term \u201cliberal\u201d was appropriated by politicians such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and came to stand for policy packages like the New Deal and, later on, the Great Society. Liberals were people who believed in using government to regulate business and to provide public goods\u2014education, housing, dams and highways, retirement pensions, medical care, welfare, and so on. And they thought collective bargaining would insure that workers could afford the goods the economy was producing.\nThose mid-century liberals were not opposed to capitalism and private enterprise. On the contrary, they thought that government programs and strong labor unions made capitalist economies more productive and more equitable. They wanted to save capitalism from its own failures and excesses. Today, we call these people progressives. (Those on the right call them Communists.)\nDiscover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\nNeoliberalism, in the American context, can be understood as a reaction against mid-century liberalism. Neoliberals think that the state should play a smaller role in managing the economy and meeting public needs, and they oppose obstacles to the free exchange of goods and labor. Their liberalism is, sometimes self-consciously, a throwback to the \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d that they associate with Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill: laissez-faire capitalism and individual liberties. Hence, retro-liberalism.\nThe label \u201cneoliberal\u201d has been attached to a range of political species, from libertarians, who tend to be programmatically anti-government, to New Democrats like Bill Clinton, who embrace the policy goals of the New Deal and the Great Society but think that there are better means of achieving them. But most types of neoliberalism reduce to the term \u201cmarkets.\u201d Get the planners and the policymakers out of the way and let the markets find solutions.\nThe scholarly literature on neoliberalism tends to focus either on the intellectual genealogy of neoliberal thought (which starts, more or less, in Europe in the nineteen-thirties) or on the political history of neoliberal policies (which start in the nineteen-seventies). Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway\u2019s \u201cThe Big Myth: How American Business Taught Us to Loathe Government and Love the Free Market\u201d (Bloomsbury) adds a third dimension to the story. In their account, neoliberalism\u2014they prefer the term \u201cmarket fundamentalism,\u201d which they credit to George Soros\u2014represents the triumph of decades of pro-business lobbying. They also tell the intellectual story and the political story of neoliberalism, so their book is, in effect, three histories piled on top of one another. This makes for a very thick volume.\nThe lobbying story is good to know. Most voters are highly sensitive to the suggestion that someone might take away their personal freedom, and this is what pro-business propaganda has been warning them about for the past hundred years. The propaganda took many forms, from college textbooks funded by business groups to popular entertainments like Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d books, which preach the lesson of self-sufficiency. (The books were promoted as autobiographical, but Oreskes and Conway say that Wilder, with the help of her daughter, completely misrepresented the facts of her family story.)\nThe endlessly iterated message of this lobbying, Oreskes and Conway say, is that economic and political freedoms are indivisible. Any restriction on the first is a threat to the second. This is the \u201cbig myth\u201d of their title, and they show us, in somewhat fire-hose detail, how a lot of people spent a lot of time and money putting that idea into the mind of the American public. The book is an immense scholarly feat, but the authors insist that it is not just an \u201cacademic intervention.\u201d They have a political purpose. They think that one role of government has been to correct for market failures, and, if government is discredited, how is it going to correct for what may be the biggest market failure of all: climate change?\nOreskes and Conway suggest that we can get an idea of what we\u2019re up against from the pandemic. Millions of Americans seemed either to disbelieve what government officials were telling them about COVID or to regard public-health measures like vaccines and mask mandates as encroachments on their liberty. (There was also some anti-vaxxer hysteria.) Fantastically well-compensated professional athletes, on whose liberties very little encroaches, were among the worst role models.\nComparing the American response to that of other countries, Oreskes and Conway suggest that forty per cent of this country\u2019s COVID deaths could have been prevented if Americans trusted science, government, and one another. They think that years of science-bashing (the subject of their previous book, \u201cMerchants of Doubt\u201d) and anti-government messaging have taught Americans not to. Now when public officials propose policies for addressing climate change, people will be told, \u201cThey want to take your televisions away,\u201d and many will believe it.\nThe notion of hitching economic freedom to political freedom, or corporate freedom to personal freedom, was not dreamed up by lobbyists. It is the core tenet of the scriptural texts of market fundamentalism, Friedrich A. Hayek\u2019s \u201cThe Road to Serfdom\u201d and Milton Friedman\u2019s \u201cCapitalism and Freedom.\u201d Hayek and Friedman were academic economists; they both were awarded the Nobel Prize, in 1974 and 1976, respectively. But their famous books are not academic. They\u2019re polemical, high on assertion and low on evidence. Still, the two books have remained in print. They pushed some buttons.\nHayek wrote \u201cThe Road to Serfdom\u201d during the Second World War. He was living in England, after emigrating from Austria to take a position at the London School of Economics, and his book came out there in 1944. If you were looking back at recent world history in 1944, what would you see? A stock-market crash, a worldwide depression, and the rise of two powerful totalitarian states that, if Hitler had not made the mistake of invading the Soviet Union, might have divided Europe between them for generations. You might reasonably have concluded that, even if Germany was finally defeated and the Soviet Union was put back in its box, free-market capitalism and liberal democracy had had their day.\nHayek felt this was what people in England were concluding\u2014that a state-managed economy, of some sort, was necessary to prevent another meltdown. They might not think that this would mean giving up their liberty, but Hayek warned them that that was a fatal mistake. He dedicated the book to \u201cThe Socialists of All Parties.\u201d He believed that central planning, even when carried out by an elected government, was a kind of dictatorship. People shouldn\u2019t be told what to do with their property, he said, and \u201cwhat our generation has forgotten is that the system of private property is the most important guaranty of freedom, not only for those who own property, but scarcely less for those who do not.\u201d\nHayek acknowledged that there are things governments can do that private actors cannot. Presumably, you need laws and courts to protect property rights and to enforce contracts; you need an army, and some form of money. There are also public needs that private enterprise cannot profitably or efficiently address. Oreskes and Conway tell us that Hayek \u201cwas not as hostile to social welfare programs as he is often reputed to be.\u201d\nBut Hayek was making a classic slippery-slope argument. Planning is top-down and requires centralized authority, and, whatever that authority\u2019s motives, this inevitably devolves into totalitarianism. \u201cFrom the saintly and single-minded idealist to the fanatic is often but a step,\u201d as he put it. He believed that socialism destroys what he saw as a basic principle of Western civilization: individualism. The welfare state might keep people housed and fed, but the cost is existential. It\u2019s not just that people will lose their freedom\u2014it\u2019s that they will not even care.\n\u201cThe Road to Serfdom\u201d was written in a time of geopolitical uncertainty. The possibility of a totalitarian future, the \u201cCould it happen here?\u201d question, obsessed many intellectuals\u2014including Karl Popper, Hannah Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, and George Orwell, who reviewed Hayek\u2019s book. Hayek is \u201cprobably right in saying that in this country the intellectuals are more totalitarian-minded than the common people,\u201d Orwell wrote. \u201cBut he does not see, or will not admit, that a return to \u2018free\u2019 competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than the State.\u201d The New York Times called \u201cThe Road to Serfdom\u201d \u201cone of the most important books of our generation.\u201d It spoke to its moment.\nFriedman\u2019s book, on the other hand, would seem to have been almost comically mistimed. He published it in 1962, in the middle of what the economist Robert Lekachman, in a widely read book published in 1966, called \u201cthe Age of Keynes.\u201d Government programs were understood to be essential to stimulating growth and maintaining \u201caggregate demand.\u201d If people stop consuming, companies stop producing, workers get laid off, and so on. That was taken to be the lesson of the Great Depression and the New Deal: more government intervention, not less.\nIn the U.K., the postwar Labour government, as Hayek had feared, nationalized key industries and created the National Health Service\u2014\u201csocialized medicine,\u201d as opponents called it. In the United States, government programs like Social Security and the G.I. Bill were enormously popular, and huge spending acts were passed. The National and Interstate Defense Highways Act of 1956 authorized the construction of the interstate highway system, easing interstate commerce and lowering transportation costs. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 pumped federal money into education. In 1964, Congress would outlaw racial and gender discrimination in employment. A year later, it would create Medicare and Medicaid. Government spending more than doubled between 1950 and 1962. Meanwhile, the top marginal tax rate in the United States and the United Kingdom was close to ninety per cent.\nIt was a neoliberal\u2019s nightmare\u2014and yet between 1950 and 1973 the world G.D.P. grew at the fastest rate in history. The United States and Western Europe experienced remarkably high rates of growth and low levels of wealth inequality\u2014in fact, the lowest anywhere at any time. In 1959, the poverty rate in the United States was twenty-two per cent; in 1973, it was eleven per cent. It was also a period of \u201cliberation.\u201d People felt free, acted out their freedom, and wanted more of it. They weren\u2019t supposed to feel that way. They were supposed to be passive and dependent. It would not have seemed a propitious time to write a full-out assault on government.\nAnd yet Friedman wrote one, and he did not pull punches. \u201cCapitalism and Freedom\u201d begins with a contemptuous response to John F. Kennedy\u2019s Inaugural Address. \u201cThe paternalistic \u2018what your country can do for you,\u2019 \u201d Friedman wrote, \u201cimplies that government is the patron, the citizen the ward, a view that is at odds with the free man\u2019s belief in his own responsibility for his own destiny.\u201d (Of course, Kennedy had said that Americans should not ask what their country could do for them. But never mind. It\u2019s that kind of book.)\nFriedman provided a list of things he was opposed to: rent control, minimum-wage laws, bank regulation, the Federal Communications Commission, the Social Security program, occupational licensure requirements, \u201cso-called\u201d public housing, the military draft, publicly operated toll roads, and national parks. Later on in the book, he came out against anti-discrimination laws (which he compared to the Nazis\u2019 Nuremberg laws: if the government can tell you whom you must not discriminate against, it can tell you whom you must discriminate against), labor unions (anti-competitive monopolies), public schools (where taxpayers are compelled to fund courses on \u201cbasket weaving\u201d), and the graduated income tax. He argued that an inheritance tax is no more just than a talent tax would be. Inheritance and talent are both accidents of birth. Why is it fair to tax the first and not the second?\nMuch in Friedman\u2019s book echoes Hayek. (From 1950 to 1972, they both taught at the University of Chicago, Friedman in the economics department and Hayek in the Committee on Social Thought.) \u201cA society which is socialist cannot be democratic, in the sense of guaranteeing individual freedom,\u201d Friedman says. And: \u201cEconomic freedom is . . . an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom.\u201d\nLike Hayek, Friedman conjured up the loss of individualism. Yes, he conceded, government programs and regulations might improve the quality of life and raise the level of performance of social services locally, but, in the process, they would \u201creplace progress by stagnation\u201d and \u201csubstitute uniform mediocrity for the variety essential for that experimentation which can bring tomorrow\u2019s laggards above today\u2019s mean.\u201d\nEssentially, \u201cCapitalism and Freedom\u201d is an argument for privatization. The free market is a price system: it aligns supply and demand and assigns goods and services their appropriate price. If the state wants to get into the business of, say, retirement benefits, it should have to compete on a level playing field with rival providers. There should be a market in retirement plans. People should be free to choose one, and equally free to choose none.\nFriedman had some ingenious ideas about ways to use the market approach\u2014for example, allowing investors to pay university tuition in exchange for a percentage of a student\u2019s future earnings. He thought that school segregation could be fixed by a voucher system that permitted parents to choose which school to send their children to.\n\u201cHow did this radical and incredible\u2014which is to say not credible\u2014book sell so well?\u201d Oreskes and Conway ask. And it did: half a million copies, with translations into eighteen languages. One reason was Friedman\u2019s promotional energy. He made himself into one of the most prominent public intellectuals of the day. He wrote a column for Newsweek, and between 1966 and 1984 he published more than four hundred op-eds. In 1980, with his wife, Rose, he produced a ten-part television program called \u201cFree to Choose,\u201d broadcast on PBS.\nOne episode has him explaining how a pencil comes into being. The materials\u2014wood, graphite, rubber, metal\u2014are produced independently in countries all over the world. How do they come together to make a pencil? \u201cThere was no commissar sending out orders from some central office,\u201d Friedman says, waving a pencil. \u201cIt was the magic of the price system.\u201d His viewers may not have been sure exactly what \u201cthe price system\u201d was, but it was a cool show-and-tell. And they knew what a commissar was. Nobody likes a commissar.\nAnother reason Friedman\u2019s book survived the age of Keynes is that the Chicago economics department became well established in the academic world. A number of its faculty during Friedman\u2019s time there would also win Nobel Prizes, including George Stigler and Gary Becker, whose views were closely allied with Friedman\u2019s. There emerged something called the Chicago School, identified as the intellectual force behind a microeconomic approach to social science, which explains much behavior in terms of \u201cprice\u201d (one of Becker\u2019s books is called \u201cThe Economic Approach to Human Behavior\u201d), and the law and economics movement in jurisprudence. This work was not propaganda, but, as Oreskes and Conway say, it gave pro-business propaganda intellectual credibility.\nThe Chicago School had its Founding Father: Adam Smith. Friedman had an Adam Smith necktie; Stigler wore an Adam Smith T-shirt. As Glory M. Liu explains in her history of Smith\u2019s reception in the United States, \u201cAdam Smith\u2019s America\u201d (Princeton), the Chicagoans \u201creimagined Smith as the original author of the price mechanism.\u201d This involved carving away the parts of Smith\u2019s thought that didn\u2019t fit the thesis. \u201c \u2018Self-interest\u2019 and the \u2018invisible hand,\u2019 \u201d Liu says, came to signify \u201can entire way of thinking about society as being organized through the natural, automatic, and self-generating actions of individual economic actors.\u201d\nOreskes and Conway agree. They point out that when Stigler produced an abridged \u201cWealth of Nations,\u201d in the nineteen-fifties, he omitted most of the passages in which Smith advocates the regulation of industries where the unchecked pursuit of self-interest can cause social harm. Banking was one of them. What Oreskes and Conway call the \u201cAmericanization\u201d of Adam Smith reduced him to the trope of the invisible hand.\nIn fact, the phrase \u201cinvisible hand\u201d appears only once in the thousand pages of \u201cThe Wealth of Nations.\u201d Smith uses the metaphor to characterize the means by which an act of self-interested profit-seeking can serve a social good. (That idea had already been put forward in Bernard Mandeville\u2019s \u201cThe Fable of the Bees,\u201d published in 1714.) Smith\u2019s book, published in 1776, meant to oppose a prevalent economic strategy in eighteenth-century Britain\u2014the nationalist and protectionist system of mercantilism\u2014by explaining how free trade and the division of labor create more national wealth. He was writing before the Industrial Revolution had really begun or the modern concept of capitalism had taken hold. It is an anachronism to read him as though he were countering Keynes.\nStigler called \u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d a \u201cstupendous palace erected upon the granite of self-interest.\u201d But Smith did not think that markets are always self-regulating, and he did not think that people are always self-interested. The very first sentence of his other major work, \u201cThe Theory of Moral Sentiments,\u201d reads, \u201cHow selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d (Becker might have called this a \u201cshadow price.\u201d There are certain things that make people feel better or worse about themselves, and those feelings get priced into the good or service they are buying. For a free-market economist, the price is always right.)\nThe real reason market fundamentalism prevailed was not that it won the war of ideas. It was that the postwar boom came to an end. The economy started to go south in the early seventies, with the oil embargo and the recession of 1973-74, during which the Dow lost forty-five per cent of its value. It became prohibitively expensive to borrow money. By 1980, the prime rate, the interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers, had gone past twenty per cent (it was 2.25 per cent in 1950), and inflation was around fourteen per cent. The unemployment rate rose from 3.5 per cent in 1969 to 10.8 per cent in 1982. The American economy was stuck in \u201cstagflation\u201d: high inflation and low growth.\nNixon, Ford, Carter\u2014it seemed that no Administration knew how to stop the bleeding. Government spending and high marginal tax rates, which had seemed to work fine in the nineteen-sixties, now looked like impediments to recovery. The Chicago School approach gained traction. Still, as the historian Daniel T. Rodgers points out in \u201cAge of Fracture,\u201d his intellectual history of the period, \u201cthe puzzle of the age is not that economic concepts moved into the center of social debate; the riddle is that so abstract and idealized an idea of efficient market action should have arisen amid so much real-world market imperfection.\u201d\nIt helped that, in 1980, a true believer was elected President. Ronald Reagan had been converted to free-market theology during the years he spent as a spokesman for General Electric, from 1954 to 1962, not only hosting \u201cGeneral Electric Theatre,\u201d broadcast every Sunday in prime time on CBS, but preaching the free-enterprise gospel and the magic of markets to workers in G.E. plants around the country. \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem,\u201d he said in his Inaugural Address. \u201cGovernment is the problem.\u201d Those were sentences that the authors of \u201cThe Road to Serfdom\u201d and \u201cCapitalism and Freedom\u201d had lived to hear. The United Kingdom, under Margaret Thatcher, undertook a parallel revision of welfare-state economics (rougher there, since there was more for Thatcher to undo).\nOne of the first things Reagan did as President was to break the air-traffic controllers\u2019 union, whose members, federal employees, had gone on strike. He fired the strikers, and the union was decertified. Still, although Reagan\u2019s pro-market spirit was willing, his political flesh was weak. He passed the largest peacetime tax increase in American history, failed to eliminate any major government agency, and added nearly two trillion dollars to the national debt. But he implanted in the mind of the electorate the idea that business freedom is personal freedom. In 1988, he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Milton Friedman.\nAs Oreskes and Conway point out, deregulation really began under Jimmy Carter, Reagan\u2019s predecessor. Carter, sometimes with the support of the arch-liberal Edward M. Kennedy, deregulated the airline industry, railroads, and trucking. Deregulation continued after Clinton was elected, in 1992. \u201cThe era of big government is over,\u201d he famously announced. \u201cSelf-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues\u2014we must have both.\u201d In the United Kingdom, Tony Blair\u2019s government took the same approach. Together, Blair and Clinton promoted a neoliberal approach to international trade, the beginnings of what we now call globalization.\nIn 1993, Congress ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1996, it passed the Telecommunications Act, opening up the communications business. And in 1999 it repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era statute that prohibited commercial banks from joining together with securities firms (\u201cinvestment banks\u201d).\nThese policies were undertaken in the belief that freeing markets increases productivity and competition, lowering prices, and that markets regulate themselves more efficiently than administrators can. But some of their unintended effects can still be felt today. NAFTA had a net-positive impact on the economies of the signatories\u2014Canada, Mexico, and the United States\u2014but it also made it easier for American manufacturers to relocate plants to Mexico, where labor is cheaper, inflicting severe social and economic damage on certain areas of the U.S. It is probable that many Trump voters were people, or the children of people, whose lives and communities were disrupted by NAFTA.\nThe Telecommunications Act included a clause, Section 230, immunizing Web operators from liability for third-party content posted on their sites. The consequences are well known. And the weakening of Glass-Steagall, along with the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan\u2019s relaxation of bank oversight, has been blamed for the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed, a crisis that Oreskes and Conway estimate cost the public twenty-three trillion dollars.\nYet the neoliberal era was hardly a triumph for Friedman\u2019s approach. Pro-market policies were generally mixed with state funding and government direction. Clinton may have subscribed to many neoliberal principles, but one of the first initiatives his Administration attempted was a reform of the health-care system where the government was to give every citizen a \u201chealth-care security card\u201d\u2014which sounds a lot like socialized medicine.\nBoth NAFTA and the Telecommunications Act contain plenty of regulatory requirements. The government is overseeing how business is done, not simply stepping aside. As with the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion, it\u2019s the state that creates the social space in which economic freedom can be exercised. Without government, we are in a state of nature, where coercion, not freedom, is the norm.\nThere is a strange blind spot in \u201cThe Big Myth.\u201d The authors are exhaustive in debunking the fundamentalist view of the \u201cmagic of the marketplace\u201d (although fundamentalisms aren\u2019t hard to debunk, and a lot of their criticisms are familiar). But what especially exercises them is the equation pro-business propagandists made between free markets and political liberties\u2014\u201cthe claim that America was founded on three basic, interdependent principles: representative democracy, political freedom, and free enterprise.\u201d Oreskes and Conway call this \u201ca fabricated claim.\u201d Is it?\nAs they point out, there\u2019s no mention of free enterprise in the Constitution. But there are mentions of property, and almost every challenge to government interference in the economy rests on the concept of a right to property. The Framers were highly sensitive to this issue. They not only made the concept of private property compatible with the concept of political rights; they made property itself a political right. And vice versa: rights were personal property. \u201cAs a man is said to have a right to his property,\u201d James Madison wrote, \u201che may be equally said to have a property in his rights.\u201d\nThus the Fifth Amendment provides that \u201cno person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d Like the rest of the Bill of Rights, this was originally understood to apply only to the federal government, but the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, applied it to the states as well, and courts have invoked that amendment\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d clause to protect all sorts of fundamental rights that are unspecified in the Bill of Rights\u2014such as the right to privacy, which is the constitutional basis for the decision in Roe v. Wade. This is the judicial doctrine known as \u201csubstantive due process.\u201d\nPro-business lobbyists were therefore completely correct to define free enterprise, by which they meant the freedom to do as they liked with their property, as a political liberty. In the early decades of the twentieth century, the Supreme Court used substantive due process to strike down government acts and programs that impinged on the right to property and on what the Court called \u201cthe liberty of contract\u201d\u2014including minimum-wage laws, worker-safety regulations, and a number of New Deal programs. The treatment of private ownership as a political right was not something dreamed up by Friedrich Hayek or the National Association of Manufacturers. It is, for better or worse, part of the fabric of American society.\nBut this political liberty is not absolute. The Framers were adept at balancing one grant of authority with a countervailing one. When the Supreme Court\u2014under pressure from Franklin Roosevelt, who threatened to pack the Court\u2014did an about-face on the New Deal, in 1937, it had another legal mechanism at its disposal. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the power \u201cto regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201d This is the \u201ccommerce clause,\u201d which has, since the time of John Marshall, been broadly interpreted to give Congress the power to regulate virtually everything related to interstate commerce. Through the commerce clause, courts began giving Congress new powers, opening the way to the programs and policies of mid-century liberalism. The constitutional authority for the anti-discrimination provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is the commerce clause. You can\u2019t tell the story of business\u2019s war on government without taking this legal context into account. Due process and the commerce clause were the weapons the antagonists fought with, and, as it generally does, the Supreme Court had the last word.\nWhat hath neoliberalism wrought? On the plus side of the ledger: in 1980, about forty-three per cent of the world lived in extreme poverty (by the World Bank\u2019s definition), and today the number is about eight per cent. Globalization has lifted a billion humans out of poverty in just forty years. And you own many household items, like batteries and T-shirts, that were manufactured in Communist countries\u2014China and Vietnam\u2014and that were very inexpensive. New parts of the world, notably East and South Asia, are now economic players. Technological knowledge is no longer a monopoly of the First World powers.\nAmong the debits: deregulation, which was supposed to spur competition, has not slowed the trend toward monopoly. Despite the Telecommunications Act, just three companies\u2014Verizon, T-Mobile, and A.T. & T.\u2014provide ninety-nine per cent of wireless service. Six companies dominate the media in the United States: Comcast, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global, the Fox Corporation, and Sony. Book publishing in the United States is dominated by the so-called Big Five: Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Random House, and Simon & Schuster. The music industry is dominated by just three corporate players: the Universal, Sony, and Warner music divisions.\nThe big fish, with their piles of capital, keep swallowing up the little fish. The Big Five would now be the Big Four if Penguin Random House\u2019s deal to acquire Simon & Schuster had not been ruled a violation of antitrust law last fall. Of the twelve most valuable companies in the world, eight of which are tech businesses, all are monopolies or near-monopolies.\nAnd, as Martin Wolf emphasizes in his highly informed and intelligent critique of the global economy, \u201cThe Crisis of Democratic Capitalism\u201d (Penguin Press), inequality is everywhere. At the level of the firm: in 1980, C.E.O.s were paid about forty-two times as much as the average employee; in 2016, they were paid three hundred and forty-seven times as much. At the level of the whole society: the three million people who make up the wealthiest one per cent of Americans are collectively worth more than the two hundred and ninety-one million who make up the bottom ninety per cent.\nIt is the rise in inequality abetted by the neoliberal system that poses the most immediate threat to civil society. Wolf doubts whether the United States will still be a functioning democracy at the end of the decade. Either way, the sun has set on neoliberalism. Both parties have drifted closer to something like mercantilism; the language of the market has lost its magic. \u201cBidenomics\u201d entails immense government spending; meanwhile, a new cadre\u2014protectionists, crony capitalists, ethno-nationalists, and social and cultural provincials\u2014has been rewriting party platforms. Republicans eagerly lambaste Big Tech and clash with \u201cwoke\u201d corporations, more intent on fighting a culture war than on championing commerce. People used to pray for the end of neoliberalism. Unfortunately, this is what it looks like. \u2666"

Because you can study things to death. And the things that are laid out here will lead to a more effective agency.\"\nWalensky did not provide a timeline for the changes, but said she will provide regular updates internally.\n\"None of these challenges happened overnight,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"The work ahead will take time and engagement at all levels of the organization.\"\nABC News' Eric M. Strauss contributed to this report."

      "text": "Fauci: Mixed Messaging On Masks Set U.S. Public Health Response Back\nFauci: Mixed Messaging On Masks Set U.S. Public Health Response Back\nWhile conceding missteps in the federal response to the coronavirus, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday it is not too late to avoid the dire picture he outlined in congressional testimony of 100,000 coronavirus cases a day.\nThe nation's leading infectious disease experts said the conflicting advice offered by federal leaders around face masks in the early days of the pandemic helped sow distrust and continues to hamper the government's ability to slow the outbreak.\n\"We have to admit it, that that mixed message in the beginning, even though it was well meant to allow masks to be available for health workers, that was detrimental in getting the message across,\" Fauci said in an interview with Mary Louise Kelly of NPR's All Things Considered. \"No doubt about it.\"\nDespite the overwhelming consensus among public-health experts that face masks can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, face coverings have become a partisan issue, something critics of the federal response have blamed on what they say has been a confusing back-and-forth on the issue from the Trump administration.\nAs late as February 29, Surgeon General Jerome Adams was telling Americans on Twitter to stop buying masks, saying they are \"NOT effective.\" But the guidance soon changed, and by early April the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending that Americans wear face coverings in public. Even then, however, President Trump said he would not be wearing a mask himself.\n\"I think that that did have an effect,\" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of the conflicting guidance. \"The message early on became confusing,\" he said.\nBut, he added, once it became clear people can spread the virus without knowing they're sick, public health leaders realized the message needed to change.\n\"We have people who may not even know they're infected and are inadvertently infecting others,\" said Fauci.\nAnd the latest evidence shows some protection to the wearer too. \"It isn't 100% protection by any means, but certainly the amount that you get is worth wearing it, not only worth wearing it, but really compels you to wear it.\"\nFauci said he has been encouraged by a growing chorus among Republican leaders in recent days encouraging Americans to wear masks. That list has grown to include not only Vice President Mike Pence, but top Republicans in the Senate, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Marco Rubio of Florida.\nThat's been matched by a rising number of states that now require that masks be worn in public. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia now mandate masks in public \u2014 a list that was joined by Pennsylvania on Wednesday.\nThe tightening of coronavirus-related restrictions in many states comes amid a rapidly escalating surge in new cases that has eclipsed some of the worst days of the pandemic during the spring. More than 44,000 cases were reported Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, one of the highest daily totals yet.\nAnd the worst may still be to come. In testimony before the Senate on Tuesday, Fauci warned that the virus could soon reach 100,000 cases per day.\nIn his testimony, Fauci said one reason cases continue to climb is because the nation may not have shut down as aggressively as it needed to early in the crisis. He noted that in Europe, as much as 95% of the population was effectively shut down, while in the U.S., the figure was closer to 50%.\n\"If you look at the Europeans, they got the curve way down,\" he told NPR. \"Once the curve is way down ... it is much easier, when you do get blips of infection as you try to open up, to contain those infections. And if you look at our curve, it peaked, it came down a little and then it stayed about flat until just recently when it resurged up again. It makes it much more difficult because ... you're sort of chasing after things as opposed to getting your thumb on them. So we're in a bad position because of what happened early on.\"\nFauci said he believes the country can avoid another lockdown, \"but we have to do things a bit differently than what we've been doing.\"\nHe said activities like \"congregating in bars, congregating in crowds, people getting together in a celebratory way ... without wearing masks\" contributed to recent case surges. This behavior, he said, while understandable because people \"felt cooped up,\" represented \"a violation of the principles of what we're trying to do, and that is the social distancing, the wearing of masks.\"\n\"It's really in our hands as a community, as a nation, as a populace to make this happen,\" he said. \"It does not have to be 100,000 cases a day.\""

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that the mRNA vaccine platform is primarily undermined by manufactured distrust fueled by misinformation, leading to federal funding cuts and policy decisions that halt development of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 and other diseases. It highlights the role of officials like NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in citing public mistrust and alleged safety concerns to justify terminating BARDA grants and other research projects. The piece also notes that despite robust evidence of mRNA vaccines\u2019 safety and efficacy, the narrative of distrust has prompted a broader setback for mRNA research, affecting future vaccine development and pandemic preparedness.",
