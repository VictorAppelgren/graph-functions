  "content": "Wage growth trails rising costs, with consumers sensitive to prices and businesses hesitant to raise them further.\n\nMost districts surveyed in the Fed\u2019s latest Beige Book report mixed or neutral signals on the economy, jobs and spending, with only Chicago improving in all areas.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s latest Beige Book survey\u2014a qualitative assessment of the economy, small business and consumer sentiment\u2014indicated that caution is the rule of the day.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nBank and branch directors, businesses, community organizations, economists, market experts and other sources indicated a somewhat pessimist outlook relative to economic activity and the job market, whereas reports from branch officers are more benign relative to consumer spending.\n\nEconomic activity increased rose across six districts (one more than in the prior publication), although the number of districts reporting declining activity also grew from two to four.\n\nJob activity skewed to the downside: neutrality or mixed pictures in seven cases, four more than had been seen in July\u2019s data. Four districts painted overall negative pictures regarding the job market, two more than in the last report.\n\nAs for consumer spending, seven districts reported neutral, mixed or negative signals. By way of example, the report noted that in Boston, \u201ctariff-related uncertainty dimmed the outlook for consumer spending.\u201d\n\nOnly one district reported overall simultaneous improvement in domestic product, labor markets and consumer spending: The Chicago Fed.\n\nReports about hiring continued to be \u201cgenerally cautious,\u201d which many contacts attributed to ongoing economic and policy uncertainty. A growing number of districts cited labor shortages in the skilled trades.\n\nEmployers in a few districts ramped up investments in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at reducing the need for additional hiring.\n\nThe pressured jobs portrait was corroborated by other data on Wednesday, as the Jobs Opening and Labor Turnover Survey data showed that that openings declined again to 7.2 million, nearly 200,000 fewer than in June, more than 500,000 fewer than in May, and down over 300,000 from the same period last year. This months\u2019 Beige Book reported that, looking ahead, many contacts expected to postpone major hiring and layoff decisions until uncertainty diminished.\n\nAs noted in the report, \u201cSentiment \u2026 remained pessimistic among commercial real estate contacts and became more guarded among retail and tourism contacts.\u201d\n\nThe spending trends come as the Fed\u2019s districts indicated that wages have been failing to keep up with rising prices for many households. Effects on bottom lines may be even more lackluster, as the Fed\u2019s report outlines retail and hospitality sectors commonly offered deals and promotions to retain price-sensitive consumers. Nearly all districts also noted tariff-related price increases.\n\nYet, reports often mentioned at least some hesitancy in raising prices, citing customer price sensitivity, lack of pricing power and fear of losing business.\n\nConsumer sentiment data from late August, released by The University of Michigan, supports this view. The August reading represented a dip that was pervasive across income and age groups. Sentiment now stands 14% below its own standing a year prior.",

      "text": "National Summary\nOverall Economic Activity\nMost of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts reported little or no change in economic activity since the prior Beige Book period\u2014the four Districts that differed reported modest growth. Across Districts, contacts reported flat to declining consumer spending because, for many households, wages were failing to keep up with rising prices. Contacts frequently cited economic uncertainty and tariffs as negative factors. New York reported that \"consumers were being squeezed by rising costs of insurance, utilities, and other expenses.\" Contacts observed the following responses to the consumer pullback. Retail and hospitality sectors offered deals and promotions to help price-sensitive consumers stretch their dollars\u2014supporting steady demand from domestic leisure tourists but not offsetting falling demand from international visitors. The auto sector noted flat to slightly higher sales, while consumer demand increased for parts and services to repair older vehicles. Manufacturing firms reported shifting to local supply chains where feasible and often using automation to cut costs. The push to deploy AI partly explains the surge of data center construction\u2014a rare strength in commercial real estate noted by the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts. Atlanta and Kansas City reported that data centers had increased energy demand in their Districts. Overall, sentiment was mixed among the Districts. Most firms either reported little to no change in optimism or expressed differing expectations about the direction of change from their contacts.\nLabor Markets\nEleven Districts described little or no net change in overall employment levels, while one District described a modest decline. Seven Districts noted that firms were hesitant to hire workers because of weaker demand or uncertainty. Moreover, contacts in two Districts reported an increase in layoffs, while contacts in multiple Districts reported reducing headcounts through attrition\u2014encouraged, at times, by return-to-office policies and facilitated, at times, by greater automation, including new AI tools. In turn, most Districts mentioned an increase in the number of people looking for jobs. However, half of the Districts noted that contacts reported a reduction in the availability of immigrant labor, with New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco highlighting its impact on the construction industry. Half of the Districts described modest growth in wages, while most of the others reported moderate growth. Two Districts noted little or no change in wages.\nPrices\nTen Districts characterized price growth as moderate or modest. The other two Districts described strong input price growth that outpaced moderate or modest selling price growth. Nearly all Districts noted tariff-related price increases, with contacts from many Districts reporting that tariffs were especially impactful on the prices of inputs. Contacts in multiple Districts also reported rising prices for insurance, utilities, and technology services. While some firms reported passing through their entire cost increases to customers, some firms in nearly all Districts described at least some hesitancy in raising prices, citing customer price sensitivity, lack of pricing power, and fear of losing business. In some cases, as highlighted by Cleveland and Minneapolis, firms reported being under pressure to lower prices because of competition, despite facing increased input costs. Most Districts reported that their firms were expecting price increases to continue in the months ahead, with three of those Districts noting that the pace of price increases was expected to rise further.\nHighlights by Federal Reserve District\nBoston\nEconomic activity expanded slightly overall, but consumer spending was flat. Employment was down slightly, while wages and prices increased modestly. Home sales increased moderately from a year earlier. The outlook remained cautiously optimistic on balance, although tariff-related uncertainty dimmed the outlook for consumer spending.\nNew York\nEconomic activity declined slightly as tariff-related uncertainty continued to weigh on businesses. Employment in the region was mostly unchanged, and wage growth remained modest. Selling prices rose at a moderate pace, marking some acceleration since the previous reporting period, and input prices rose strongly.\nPhiladelphia\nBusiness activity increased modestly in the current Beige Book period. Employment levels held steady, and wages rose at modest pre-pandemic rates. Firm prices rose moderately, straining budgets for many households and small businesses, and inflation expectations are higher still. In addition, tariffs and federal budget cuts are expected to add additional stress. Still, expectations for future growth broadened among most firms.\nCleveland\nFourth District business activity increased slightly in recent weeks, and contacts expected activity to rise modestly in the months ahead. Manufacturers reported flat demand because of uncertainty, and retailers said sales were flat because of affordability concerns. Contacts said cost growth remained robust, while their selling prices increased modestly.\nRichmond\nThe regional economy grew modestly in recent weeks. Consumer spending drove the overall growth as activity in non-consumer facing sectors of the economy were flat to down slightly. In particular, manufacturing activity was down modestly this cycle. Employment levels were largely unchanged, and wage growth remained moderate. Price growth remained moderate, overall, despite some pickup in price growth in the services sector.\nAtlanta\nThe Sixth District economy declined slightly. Employment remained steady, and wage pressures moderated. Prices rose moderately. Consumer spending slowed, leisure travel fell, and business travel was flat. Home sales rose slightly; commercial real estate weakened. Transportation and manufacturing declined modestly. Lending at District banks increased. Energy activity rose.\nChicago\nEconomic activity in the Seventh District increased modestly. Consumer spending increased moderately; manufacturing activity increased modestly; employment and business spending increased slightly; nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity; and construction and real estate activity declined slightly. Prices rose moderately, wages rose modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\nSt. Louis\nEconomic activity and employment levels have remained unchanged while wages and prices have increased at a faster pace in the recent past. Contacts continue to express a high degree of uncertainty and concern about the impact of immigration policies on labor supply; they expect prices to accelerate over the next year due to tariffs. The outlook remains slightly pessimistic, but deterioration has subsided.\nMinneapolis\nDistrict economic activity contracted slightly. Employment fell as labor demand softened. Wage pressures were moderate, and prices ticked up modestly. Consumer spending fell as price sensitivity rose. Manufacturing also fell, with wide variation among contacts. Commercial and residential construction improved slightly, and home sales rose slightly. Agricultural conditions remained weak given poor commodity prices and despite good crop conditions.\nKansas City\nEconomic activity was generally flat across the District. Employment declined modestly, and wage pressures remained subdued, although growth in non-wage benefit expenses caused total labor costs to rise. Input price growth was broad-based and contributed to moderate growth in selling prices, declines in profit margins, and expectations of sustained price pressures.\nDallas\nEconomic activity in the Eleventh District economy rose modestly, buoyed by a pickup in nonfinancial services and manufacturing activity. Loan demand grew, but the housing market remained weak. Employment was flat and staffing firms noted slow hiring activity. Price pressures persisted, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Outlooks improved but there was widespread trepidation regarding shifting trade policy, high interest rates, and more restrictive immigration policy.\nSan Francisco\nEconomic activity edged down slightly. Employment levels were down slightly. Wages grew somewhat, and prices rose modestly. Conditions in agriculture, retail trade, and consumer and business services sectors eased slightly. Manufacturing activity declined modestly. Conditions in residential and commercial real estate were largely unchanged, and lending activity was stable.\nNote: This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on information collected on or before August 25, 2025. This document summarizes comments received from contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials."

      "text": "But the information also details pressures on consumers navigating a balancing act in terms of spending and saving: While incomes, and particularly disposable income, are on the rise, spending is outpacing that gain. But when adjusting for inflation, there\u2019s actually been a paring back of spending; not a decline, but a deceleration.\nEstimates released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reveal personal incomes increased 0.4% at a seasonally adjusted monthly rate in July, accelerating from the 0.3% gain recorded in June. Disposable personal income, i.e. less personal current taxes, also rose 0.4%, also improving from last month\u2019s 0.3% pace.\nWages are Trending Up\nThe July increase in personal income was driven mainly by wages and salaries. Private wages and salaries grew 0.6% and accounted for 74% of the overall gains in the period.\nPersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) expanded 0.5% in July, outpacing the growth in disposable income. Services accounted for a $60.2 billion increase, while goods added $48.7 billion. Yet, goods expenditures, particularly durables, accelerated relative to June, growing by 0.8% (1.9% for durables) after a 0.4 % rise in the month prior (-0.8% for durables).\nThe PCE price index, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, increased 0.2% in July and 2.6% year-over-year, unchanged from June\u2019s 12-month rate. Prices for services have grown much faster than those of goods over the past year, at a pace of 3.6% versus 0.5% for the former. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% in July and 2.9% from one year ago, slightly faster than June\u2019s 2.8% pace.\nWhen netting out the effect of higher prices, the trend in recent months is of decelerating expenditures, close to leveling up, with the pace of income increases, which means that the \u201cgap\u201d between the two metrics is not as wide as it once was, and thus households are taking at least some steps to conserve cash.\nNarrowing the Gap\nOver the last 12 months, personal consumption expenditures have increased 2.1% in real terms, while disposable personal income has risen by 2%. July marked the seventh consecutive month in which real expenditure growth outpaced income growth on a yearlong perspective, although the gap has narrowed: consumption grew 2.2% in June while disposable income grew 1.7%. The same registers were seen in May.\nThe personal saving rate, or personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income, stood at 4.4% in July, unchanged from June. The path of the savings rate may prove indicative of the state of consumer worries: it stands below the April peak (5%), but above December\u2019s 3.5% level.\nThe move to save comes against a backdrop where, as we reported earlier this week, inflation expectations rose for the first time in three months during the same month reflected in the PCE data. Inflation expectations as estimated by the Conference Board climbed to 6.2% from 5.7% in July, but below April\u2019s peak of 7%. Concerns about tariffs and high prices, especially for food and groceries, intensified.\nAnd on Friday (Aug. 29), University of Michigan released the final data for their August Consumer Sentiment Survey, confirming a decline in sentiment of 5.7% as measured this month from July. The August decrease was pervasive across income and age groups. Sentiment now stands 14% below its own standing a year prior. Year-ahead inflation expectations moved up again after two consecutive drops, from 4.5% last month to 4.8% this month."

      "text": "New jobs promise new income, usually a salary or per-hour bump, as wages overall have been on the rise.\nComing into 2025, PYMNTS Intelligence found that 38% of individuals said they anticipated switching jobs this year. That percentage increased to 56% of those living paycheck to paycheck with issues paying bills, which indicated \u201cthat the constraints of their financial lives would incentivize them to consider a move to new employers.\u201d\nThe read-across is that upward wage mobility translates into a brighter spending picture, or at least savings, which means that some incremental financial firepower would accumulate.\nMore Seekers Than Positions\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 July Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) report showed little change compared to the previous month. Job openings stood at 7.2 million, nearly 200,000 fewer than in June, more than 500,000 fewer than in May, and down over 300,000 from the same period last year. Private sector openings decreased by 138,000.\nThe job openings rate fell for the second month in a row, dropping to 4.3% in July from 4.4% in June. Overall, there are more individuals seeking positions than there are available positions, and so the jockeying for employment is only intensifying.\nThe sector most affected was healthcare and social assistance, where openings fell by 181,000 in July and are down 360,000 since May. Retail trade openings also declined by 110,000 after rising 190,000 in June. Arts, entertainment and recreation lost 62,000 openings. On the other hand, some sectors saw increases, including construction (64,000), wholesale trade (54,000) and manufacturing (41,000).\nAs for hiring, private-sector hiring reversed its downward trend that began in April, increasing by 57,000 in July. Overall nonfarm hiring rose by 41,000. The largest gains came from wholesale trade (27,000) and manufacturing (21,000). Other increases included finance and insurance (12,000), private educational services (12,000) and retail trade (9,000). Despite these gains, several sectors saw sharp declines, including transportation, warehousing, and utilities (52,000), leisure and hospitality (40,000), and state and local government (16,000)."
