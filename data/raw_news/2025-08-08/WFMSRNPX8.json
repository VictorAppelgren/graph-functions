  "title": "California's Newsom, Pelosi back Texas Democrats as GOP warns of more escalations over walkout",
  "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have appeared shoulder-to-shoulder with Texas Democratic lawmakers in a show of support for their nearly weeklong walkout",
  "content": "\u201cWe are trying to defend democracy, as opposed to see it destroyed district by district,\u201d Newsom said amid the crowd of lawmakers at the governor's mansion. \u201cThere are no rules for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nPelosi defended the Texas walkout, calling it \u201cself-defense for our democracy.\u201d\n\nShe said Democrats will not let Trump \u201cpave over\u201d free and fair elections in the country.\n\nThe appearance of nationally prominent Democrats Newsom \u2014 a potential 2028 presidential candidate \u2014 and Pelosi underscored the increasingly high stakes for a deeply divided Washington.\n\nEarlier Friday the Texas House failed to meet a quorum for the third time this week as Democratic lawmakers continued to stay away from Austin.\n\nTexas Republicans had warned they would escalate efforts to end the walkout if defiant Democrats do not return to the Capitol. But the lawmakers who bolted for points across the country Aug. 3 still were not back for Friday\u2019s scheduled House floor vote.\n\nThe Texas Constitution requires at least 100 members to be present for the 150-member House to do business, and Republicans hold an 88-62 majority in the chamber. Only 95 lawmakers were counted as present.\n\nFrustrated Republican leaders continued to ratchet up the pressure, including new and expanding efforts to try to remove Democratic lawmakers from office and seeking help from the FBI to assist state troopers trying to find them.\n\n\u201cWe have all hands on deck, we are continuing to explore\u201d options to force Democrats home, Speaker Dustin Burrows said after the chamber failed to reach a quorum. \u201cWe will keep pressing forward until the job is done. \u2026 Each one of you knows eventually you will come back.\u201d\n\nThe news conference in Sacramento came several days after Texas Democrats appeared in Illinois with Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who said he supported the walkout \u201cbecause they don\u2019t want to live in a country where the president rigs elections for his side. That\u2019s not democracy.\u201d\n\nOne of the lawmakers in California, Texas State Rep. Ann Johnson, alluded to the national implications of the dispute, saying, \u201cWe recognize this is not just about Texas. This is about ensuring that the voters get to determine the outcome of their next election.\u201d\n\nAs California Democrats privately prepare a proposal for new House district lines that would go to voters, Assembly member Isaac Bryan said, \u201cThis is not a turn-the-other-cheek moment while they continue to send blow after blow to the foundations of democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Texas House is scheduled to reconvene Monday, but the dozens of Democrats who left the state have shown no signs of buckling.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit directly to the all-Republican state Supreme Court on Friday seeking to have 13 of the Democratic lawmakers immediately removed from office, or at least given a 48-hour warning that they must return or have their offices declared vacated.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the lawmakers have effectively \u201cabandoned\u201d their office and duties, and they were singled out for making public statements that they left for the purpose of blocking the vote and disrupting House business.\n\n\"Their out-of-state rebellion cannot go unchecked, and the business of Texas must go on,\u201d Paxton said.\n\nPaxton's lawsuit includes Rep. Gene Wu, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, who also faces a similar lawsuit filed by Gov. Greg Abbott. Wu's legal team argued that the state constitution allows House members to be removed only by a two-thirds vote of the chamber, not the courts.\n\nWu said this week that quorum-breaking is not an abandonment of office but a legitimate form of dissent.\n\nIn a separate filing in state district court, Paxton also sued former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate, alleging that his political group, Powered by People, improperly gave money to cover costs for the absent Democrats and continued to raise more for them. O'Rourke and his organization did not immediately issue a response to the filing but said this week that they would be undeterred by Paxton's threats.\n\nAbbott promised that he's willing to play the long game to get the bill passed.\n\n\u201cWe have an agenda to pass priorities critical to Texans, and we will get it done. I\u2019ll call special session after special session\u2014no matter how long it takes\u2014until the job is finished,\u201d Abbott said on the social platform X.\n\nThe current special session ends Aug. 19, and the missing lawmakers already face mounting fines for every day they are gone and civil arrest warrants issued by the state House.\n\nTrump wants five more seats out of Texas to potentially avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms, when Democrats reclaimed the U.S. House and proceeded to thwart his agenda and impeach him twice.\n\nThe dynamics could embroil the 2026 midterm campaign in legislative and court battles testing Trump\u2019s power over the Republican Party, Democrats\u2019 ability to mount opposition and the durability of the U.S. system of federalism that balances power between Washington and the states.\n\nVertuno reported from Austin, and Blood from Los Angeles.

      "text": "Texas Democrats plead for donations to extend their walkout and block Trump\u2019s redistricting plan\nTexas Democrats plead for donations to extend their walkout and block Trump\u2019s redistricting plan\nAfter leaving Texas for Illinois to prevent a legislative vote on a Republican redistricting plan, state House Democratic leader Gene Wu needed a means to project his voice \u2014 and viewpoints \u2014 to a national audience. So he tapped his campaign account to buy a microphone for news conferences.\nWhen it came to covering the hefty hotel bill for Wu and his roughly 50 colleagues, the lawmaker said he relied on money from his chamber\u2019s Democratic Caucus.\nNow Texas Democrats are pleading for donations to help finance what could be a walkout of weeks \u2014 if not months \u2014 in a high-stakes attempt to prevent the Republican majority from passing a plan sought by President Donald Trump. The president is urging Texas and other GOP-controlled states to redraw their congressional districts to help Republicans maintain control of the U.S. House in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of small-dollar donations,\u201d Wu told The Associated Press, \u201cand that\u2019s going to be used to help keep this thing going.\u201d\nA political group led by Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate, gave money to the Texas House Democratic Caucus to help cover the up-front costs, according to a spokesperson for the group, Powered by People. O\u2019Rourke this week has been holding events in red states to fire up Democrats and encourage donations.\nPowered by People has not disclosed how much it contributed. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said Wednesday he\u2019s launching an investigation into whether O\u2019Rourke\u2019s group has committed bribery by a \u201cfinancial influence scheme\u201d benefiting Democrats who left Texas.\nIn response, O\u2019Rourke said he would be undeterred by the threat of an investigation and used it as a fundraising opportunity.\nLawmakers face travel costs and potentially huge fines\nBy departing the state, Democratic lawmakers have prevented Republicans from obtaining the quorum needed to conduct business. Democrats hope to run out the clock on a special legislative session that ends Aug. 19. But Republican Gov. Greg Abbott could immediately call another session, raising the prospect of a prolonged and an expensive holdout.\nNot only could Texas Democrats face thousands of dollars in out-of-state lodging and dining costs, they also could eventually face fines of $500 for each day they are absent, which under House rules cannot be paid from their office budgets or political contributions.\nTexas has a part-time Legislature where lawmakers receive $600 a month, plus an additional $221 for expenses each day they are in session.\nOn Wednesday, state Sen. Jose Menendez joined Democrats from other states at a rally in Boston, where he noted that the potential daily fine for quorum-breaking lawmakers is nearly as large as their entire monthly legislative salary.\n\u201cThey need your prayers, they need your thoughts and they need you to get behind them,\u201d he said.\nSome Democrats in the Texas Senate have traveled out of state this week to support their House colleagues, but lawmakers in that chamber are not leaving the state to hold up legislative business.\n\u2018This fight is for the people\u2019\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat and billionaire, has welcomed the Texas lawmakers to his state but said he has not financially supported them. Texas state Rep. James Talarico, who has built a national following in recent weeks, said the lawmakers told Pritzker they didn\u2019t want him to fund their trip.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already been inundated with donations from across the state of Texas, from across the country, just regular people donating $5, $10, $15,\u201d Talarico said this week. \u201cAnd that\u2019s appropriate, because this fight is for the people and it should be funded by the people. We don\u2019t have billionaires who are funding this operation.\u201d\nThe House Democratic Caucus has set up a website seeking donations of between $25 and $2,500 \u2014 with a default amount of $250.\nEarlier this week, Abbott asked the state\u2019s highest court to remove Wu from office and ordered the Texas Rangers to investigate possible bribery charges related to how Democrats are paying for the walkout, alleging anyone who financially helped them could be culpable.\nWu, a former prosecutor from Houston, said the bribery suggestion is \u201cmonstrously stupid.\u201d\n\u201cNo member is leaving because they might get a campaign contribution that might restore some of the money that they\u2019re spending,\u201d he said.\nHow left-leaning groups are helping\nBefore Democrats decided to leave Texas, Wu said he called potential allies for assurance \u201cthat there would be resources that would come to our assistance.\u201d But he said that\u2019s no different from an aspiring candidate asking others for support before officially launching a campaign.\nWu, who is chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said he has participated in online sessions with representatives of dozens of Democratic, progressive and redistricting-oriented groups. Not all are financial supporters. Some are providing help in other ways, such as by coordinating publicity.\nThe Democratic National Committee has helped with communications and organizing, as well as providing help from a data analytics team, Chair Ken Martin said.\nTexas Democrats aren\u2019t worried that they\u2019ll be forced to return home in the near future because of a lack of money, said Luke Warford, founder of Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund, a Texas fundraising and organizing group. He said longtime Democratic funders understand the high cost of competing in tougher U.S. House races if Republicans succeed in redrawing the map.\n\u201cOf course having most of the delegation out of the state is going to rack up a bill,\u201d Warford said. But \u201cwhen you think about it in the context of what Donald Trump has to gain and what Democrats might lose in the short term, it\u2019s just not even close to the cost of trying to win back either these races or a bunch of other races in the country.\u201d\nThe Democratic lawmakers have been holed up at a hotel and conference center outside Chicago that was evacuated Wednesday after an unfounded bomb threat. Many lawmakers have been dining and meeting together, and are prepared to keep doing so.\nDemocratic state Rep. John Bucy III, speaking by phone from the hotel, said he isn\u2019t concerned about how the costs ultimately get covered.\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake here to be worried about those things,\u201d Bucy said. \u201cOur hotel bills seem so minor compared to what we\u2019re trying to do \u2014 to protect democracy.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Washington, Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, John O\u2019Connor in Springfield, Illinois, and Leah Willingham in Boston contributed to this report."
