      "text": "L.A. County 18-year-old pleads guilty to making 375 \u2018swatting\u2019 calls throughout the U.S.\n- Share via\nA Lancaster 18-year-old pleaded guilty Wednesday to phoning in hundreds of false threats of imminent bombings, mass shootings and violence targeting locations across the U.S., including places of worship and schools.\nAlan W. Filion pleaded guilty to four counts of making interstate threats to injure people, federal authorities said.\nFrom August 2022 to January 2024, Filion made more than 375 \u201cswatting\u201d and threatening hoax calls, including calls in which he threatened to detonate bombs or conduct mass shootings at targeted locations, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSwatting occurs when a false crime or emergency is reported at a specific location to provoke an aggressive law enforcement response, often by a SWAT team. According to federal officials, it was Filion\u2019s intention to cause large-scale deployment of police and emergency services units at targeted locations.\nFilion, who was 16 when he made a majority of the calls, targeted religious institutions, high schools, colleges and universities, as well as government officials and numerous individuals across the nation.\nSimon Cowell, Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Miley Cyrus are all victims of the hoax known as \u2018swatting.\u2019 No one\u2019s been arrested, and laws haven\u2019t caught up.\nWhen he placed a swatting call at a targeted location, Filion would call emergency responders and provide them with false information about having placing dangerous explosives, telling authorities that he and others had firearms and explosives, and that he or other individuals had committed or intended to imminently commit violent crimes.\nIn an online post, Filion claimed that when he conducts a \u201cswatting\u201d call he \u201cusually get[s] the cops to drag the victim and their families out of the house, cuff them and search the house for dead bodies.\u201d\n\u201cSwatting poses severe danger to first responders and victims, wastes significant time and resources, and creates fear in communities,\u201d said Paul Abbate, FBI deputy director.\nIn 2023 Filion tried to turn the hoax calls into a business and made posts on social media, advertising his services and swatting-for-a-fee structure.\nIt\u2019s unclear if he was ever paid to make a hoax call or had any clients.\nFilion was arrested in January in California on Florida state charges arising from a May 2023 threat he made to carry out a mass shooting at Masjid Al Hayy, a mosque in Sanford, Fla.\nAlan Winston Filion has been arrested on suspicion of swatting Masjid Al Hayy mosque in Sanford, Fla. Authorities say he may be connected to other incidents.\nIn his call to authorities about the mosque, he claimed that he had an illegally modified AR-15, a Glock 17 pistol, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails. During the call he played an audio of gunfire in the background, according to Florida prosecutors.\nFilion has remained in custody since his arrest on state charges. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. A sentencing date has not yet been set.\nFilion has also pleaded guilty to making three other threatening calls, according to the Department of Justice. One call was made in October 2022 to a public high school in Washington, in which he threatened to commit a mass shooting and claimed to have planted bombs throughout the school, authorities said.\nAnother call was made in May 2023 to a predominantly Black college in Florida, in which he claimed to have placed bombs in the walls and ceilings of campus housing and threatened to detonate them in about an hour.\nThe third call occurred in July 2023 and was made to a local police department dispatch number in Texas, in which he falsely identified himself as a senior federal law enforcement officer, provided the officer\u2019s residential address to the dispatcher, claimed to have killed the officer\u2019s mother, and threatened to kill any responding police officers.\n\u201cHe caused profound fear and chaos and will now face the consequences of his actions,\u201d said Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general."

      "text": "\u2018Swatting\u2019 calls spark panic, fear, massive police responses. Can California finally crack down?\n- Share via\nEarlier this month, the Claremont Police Department received a chilling 911 report: A caller said they were holding someone captive inside a Claremont McKenna College restroom, carrying a bomb and preparing to shoot anyone they saw on campus.\nThe call triggered a massive deployment of law enforcement and SWAT team members and sent waves of panic coursing through campus as students scrambled to find cover.\nBut the crisis was fake, the result of a \u201cswatting\u201d call, a hoax 911 report made in the hope of generating a large law enforcement response. The incident took place one day after a similar threat prompted a lockdown of Loma Linda University\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital.\nSwatting is a growing problem across the state and country. But California law can make it challenging to hold people accountable for the chaos their threats cause.\nAlthough falsely reporting an emergency to 911 is a misdemeanor offense, lawmakers are seeking tougher penalties for threats that cause mass disruption and target vulnerable populations such as schoolchildren or hospital patients.\nA false call for an armed shooter triggered a massive police response at Clarement McKenna College; L.A.\u2019s second \u2018swatting\u2019 incident in two days\nUnder current law, threats are only considered to be a crime when they are made against an individual \u2014 not an institution, such as a school or hospital. Now, state legislators are backing new legislation to close that loophole.\n\u201cRight now, California law falls short,\u201d state Sen. Susan Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) said in a statement. \u201cUnless a threat names a specific individual, officials have limited options, even when the danger is clear.\u201d\nRubio is the author of Senate Bill 19, known as the Safe Schools and Places of Worship Act, which would allow prosecutors to charge individuals who make credible threats of mass violence against schools and places of worship, even if they don\u2019t name a specific person. The goal is to hold people accountable for making intentional threats, recognizing that even hoax threats can cause mass panic, school closures and expensive law enforcement responses.\nAssemblymember Darshana R. Patel (D-San Diego) has proposed similar legislation, Assembly Bill 237, which would close the same loophole and also apply to threats made against day-care centers, hospitals and workplaces.\n\u201cAB 237 will make it clear that threats against schools and religious institutions and hospitals and other locations will not be taken lightly and there are consequences,\u201d Chula Vista Police Chief Roxana Kennedy said at a recent news conference to promote the legislation. \u201cThis bill empowers law enforcement to hold individuals accountable for wasting valuable resources and instilling fear in schools and in our community.\u201d\nA major motivator for both proposed bills was an incident involving Shoal Creek Elementary School in San Diego.\nA 38-year-old man sent hundreds of emails threatening a mass shooting at the school, but a judge dismissed the case against him because the threats didn\u2019t target a specific person, even though a gun and a map of the school were found at his home. Prosecutors have since refiled the case, naming the school principal as the target of the threats.\n\u201cThe claim that you cannot threaten an entity is beyond false,\u201d said Shoal Creek parent Jenny Basinger while testifying on behalf of AB 237. \u201cWe are the entity. We are Shoal Creek Elementary. The students, the staff, and the community are the ones left picking up the pieces of the threat.\u201d\nRubio said she focused her bill on schools and places of worship because these are the most frequently threatened institutions; the senator said she also supported Patel\u2019s more expansive bill. Should both bills pass, legislators would work together to combine them into a single law, she said.\nThe FBI reported in January 2024 that agents opened investigations into more than 100 separate threats targeting more than 1,000 institutions in 42 states during a one-month period.\nSynagogues and Jewish community centers constituted the largest category of targeted institutions, with more than 400 saying they\u2019d been threatened during that period. The second most frequent target was schools and school districts, followed by hospitals and hospital networks.\nAn 18-year-old from Lancaster has pleaded guilty to making hundreds of calls falsely threatening to conduct shootings or detonate bombs at public facilities.\n\u201cThese incidents cause fear and potentially dangerous interactions with law enforcement,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security said in a 2024 bulletin. \u201cSwatting calls and hoax threats are a daily occurrence, often come in clusters across the U.S., and are typically made to harass, intimidate, and/or retaliate against their intended target.\u201d\nLast month, a Lancaster teen was sentenced to four years in prison after making more than 375 hoax calls that included threats to detonate bombs, conduct mass shootings and \u201ckill everyone he saw,\u201d according to the U.S. Department of Justice. However, many of the cases were difficult to prosecute under current state law.\nBevin Handel, a spokesperson for the city of Claremont, said it is the city Police Department\u2019s goal to file charges against the perpetrator of the Claremont McKenna College call, but there are several challenges.\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle in holding perpetrators of swatting calls accountable is determining their identities,\u201d she said. \u201cAdvances in technology allow callers to mask their voices, phone numbers or IP addresses (\u2018spoofing\u2019) or make their false 911 calls sound more credible.\u201d\nIn addition, she said, current state law makes it challenging to file charges against swatters that \u201ctruly reflect the magnitude of the response and the fear and trauma they can cause.\u201d"
