Trump is even worse. The American people - Democrats, Republicans, Independents - do not want to continue spending billions of taxpayer dollars to starve children.\"\n\nNetanyahu's plan was also slammed by Opposition Leader and Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid.\n\n\"The decision made by the [Security] Cabinet is a disaster that will lead to many more disasters.\"\n\nSeveral Israeli security cabinet members had also admitted that the takeover plan is unlikely to lead to Hamas's defeat or the return of the hostages.",
