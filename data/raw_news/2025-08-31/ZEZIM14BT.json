  "title": "Are Laptops Designed to Fail?",
  "description": "They're not meant to be disposable.",
  "content": "A laptop isn't an impulse buy. Even the \"cheap\" ones represent a significant cost for most of us. Which means you'll probably want it to remain useful and functional for as long as possible.\n\nSadly, there are several trends that mean many shiny new laptops will lose their luster not long after the warranty runs out, leaving you in an endless cycle of buying new computers more often than you need to.\n\nHaving thinner and lighter laptops really does matter\u2014up to a point. I've long railed against unnecessary thinness in devices like tablets and smartphones, but laptops are starting to enter that same territory. You could argue that towards the end of the Intel MacBook years those laptops were already too thin to handle the heat and power required by Intel's CPUs. Apple fixed that by switching to better processors rather than compromising on the form-factor, but already a slightly thicker MacBook Pro (especially the 16-inch model) would likely result in a usable increase in performance thanks to better cooling.\n\nOutside of Apple's obsession with thin devices, that general obsession with \"ultrabooks\" is present with just about every laptop manufacturer. Laptops run pretty hot these days, and even if the CPUs and GPUs are designed to cruise comfortably at 100C, that might not be true for every solder joint or VRM.\n\nMaybe I'm just paranoid, but when running my laptop as a desktop I always use a laptop cooling pad to reduce wear on the internal fans, cut noise, and bring the whole system down by a few degrees.\n\nBatteries Are the First to Go\n\nThe lithium battery inside your laptop is a consumable item and will fail while the rest of the laptop is still perfectly functional. This was a non-issue in the days when a laptop battery was designed to be removable, but the vast majority of laptops are not designed this way. In the worst case, the battery is glued in. In the best case, these batteries can be replaced by a technician, but it's actually dangerous for the average person to try because the battery isn't packaged in a hard case and there's a risk of shorting or puncturing it.\n\nTo make things worse, some laptops might require replacement of other parts\u2014because they're all part of the same top-case, for example\u2013 which increases the price of a battery replacement so much, you might as well buy a whole new laptop\u2014what a coincidence.\n\nAs a small comfort, there are some ways to increase the lifespan of a lithium battery. Most modern laptops offer some sort of charge-limit setting. Lithium batteries degrade faster if kept at 100% charge (i.e. you're always using the laptop plugged in) and by limiting the charge to, for example, 80%, you can increase the lifespan significantly. My M4 MacBook Pro, for example, automatically limits its charge to 80% if it realizes that I haven't been using it on battery for a while.\n\nSadly, the other main killer of laptop batteries is heat, and as we already covered laptops are thinner and hotter than perhaps they should be. At least if you want them to last.\n\nI've already sort-of alluded to this above, but laptops have become worse and worse when it comes to repairability. This isn't universally true, and laptops like ThinkPads and large workstation-grade laptops are pretty great when it comes to fixing and removing components. However, if you browse a site like iFixit, which rates the repairability of consumer electronics, you'll see that consumer laptops don't score well often.\n\nThis is much worse on thinner and lighter machines, but in general laptops are not designed to be user-serviceable. Apart from that aforementioned glued-in battery, you also have to deal with fragile ribbon cables, soldered components that uses to be slotted, proprietary screws, and the general sense that the manufacturer doesn't want you working on the computer you bought.\n\nNow, in recent years, there has been a legal push to force laptop makers into creating repairable systems, but the result could be framed as malicious compliance in many cases.\n\nUltimately, making a product that lasts too long is a good way to go out of business. After all, if you sell a computer to someone that's going to last them 10+ years, that's a decade of no sales to that customer. So laptops have to be designed so that they last just long enough to seem reasonable, without leading to a situation where you put yourself out of business.\n\nIt's understandable, but that doesn't mean I have to like it! The good news is that there are alternatives. Framework, for example, are working to standardize laptop components that make them just as upgradable as desktop systems.\n\nBusiness-class laptops are also more likely to last long-term and have decent software support for longer, but, of course, these thick-boy laptops with their modest plastic shells aren't what the general population crave. No, we want those thin unibody laptops that will crack a hinge or burn out their battery in three years. I don't see that changing any time soon.",

  "summary": "The article discusses several trends that suggest that many new laptops are designed to last long enough, leaving you constantly buying new computers more often than you need to. The author points out that thinner and lighter laptops are becoming increasingly more restrictive, with laptops becoming too thin to handle the heat and power demands of Intel's CPUs. Lithium batteries, particularly those glued in to the laptop, can fail while the rest of the laptop is still functional. The article also notes that laptops are not designed to be user-serviceable and that repairability is a concern as they are not yet widely recognized. The main issue is battery failure, which can increase the cost of replacing parts due to their shared top-case, which increases the cost so much that you might as well buy a new laptop. The report also highlights the growing trend of laptop batteries that degrade faster if kept at 100% charge, and recommends ways to increase their lifespan by limiting their charge to 80%. The article concludes that laptops have become worse and worse when they are more difficult to repair than they should be. The book also discusses the need for laptop manufacturers to develop more robust repairable systems, highlighting the potential for malicious compliance and malicious compliance.",

      "text": "Summary\n- iPad Pros now slimmer with M4 chip & OLED screen but could have used extra space for improved features.\n- Apple sticking to 10-hour battery life with M4 iPad Pro, could have increased battery volume for longer use.\n- Better cooling systems and additional ports like USB-C could have improved overall functionality of the iPad Pro.\nApple has revealed its next-generation iPad Pros, packing an M4 chip, tandem OLED screen, and a thinner body than even the iPod Nano. This all sounds good, until you think about what they could have done with that extra real estate instead of putting the iPad on a diet.\nWas the iPad Too Thick?\nI own the M2 iPad Pro 12.9-inch model, which is the chonkiest modern iPad you can buy, and the model that directly precedes the latest M4 which have been slimmed down so much. I have never thought to myself \"this iPad is too thick.\"\nEven my previous 2018 12.9-inch iPad Pro was thin enough to fit inside my MacBook sleeve at the same time as the MacBook, while it had a hard plastic case on.\nI'm sure that many people will be absolutely enthralled at this new iPad that approaches the actual thickness of paper, though Jerry Rig Everything already measures a 1-degree bend in their test unit out of the box so we'll see how it works out in the long term.\nMacBooks Have Better Battery Life\u2013and That\u2019s Wrong\nMy love for my M1 MacBook Air is well-known, and one of the biggest parts of that is its long battery life. I can get two full work days out of a single charge for mixed usage, and that's been a game-changer for how I use my computer. However, Apple has decided to keep every generation of iPad's battery power pegged ar around 10 hours. Sometimes a little more, sometimes slightly less. This has been true for the first iPad I owned, the iPad 2, and it's still true for my M2 iPad Pro.\nIt's not a bad design philosophy, but since we're almost literally starting to split hairs here, I would really rather have seen the chassis stay the same thickness and the battery volume go up. I think that would be genuinely useful. Not least of which is the fact that modern iPads can run some pretty heavy apps and games. Console-level titles will run your battery down much faster. If Apple wants us to do laptop or desktop grade work on an iPad, more battery life will never go to waste.\nTo be fair to Apple, battery tests for the M4 iPad Pros look good and over on Tom's Guide, for example, they've clocked the M4 Pro in just short of 15 hours. That's a significant improvement and brings it in line with the M3 MacBook Air. However, I'm of the opinion that the iPad should outpace the MacBook when it comes to battery life given the difference in how people use them on a daily basis.\nThose M-Chips Could Use Better Cooling\nSpeaking of those heavy-duty apps, what's the use of having all that power if you can only use it all in short bursts? While thermal throttling hasn't been an issue on my current M2 or previous iPad Pros, there's certainly more sustained performance to be squeezed from these systems. There are now a few clever passive cooling systems, such as vapor chambers, that are employed in mobile devices, and that space Apple just sliced off could have been diverted to better cooling performance. The M4 is already a beast,but I can only wonder about what could have been.\nAlready Great Audio Could Be Better\nThe iPad Pro's audio is best in class. It's practically engineering black magic, and no sane person could claim it was bad. However, that doesn't mean it couldn't be better. More speakers, bigger speakers, deeper chambers\u2014I don't know how they'd do it, but something tells me the audio engineers could have used that space for something special.\nMore Ports Please\nEven my current M2 iPad Pro is certainly too thin for a full-sized USB-A port, so I'm not totally out of touch with reality, but I really think the iPad Pro can't justify either the \"Pro\" name or associated price if it sticks to having a single USB-C/Thunderbolt port. I get that it's elegant and all that, and that the iPads do have a dedicated custom connector for the Magic Keyboard, but right now I have to use a very inelegant dongle to do anything serious with my iPad.\nAt the very least I'd like to see two USB-C/Thunderbolt ports, one SD card reader, and a dedicated mini-HDMI out. After all, iPads with an M-series chip now support proper dual monitor mode. These features should have been a bigger priority than making the tablet thinner and I hope we can get at least a little more function over form in future iterations."

      "text": "Summary\n- A laptop can effectively replace a desktop for most people with the right setup.\n- An external monitor can serve as a USB hub and hide the laptop for a desktop-like experience.\n- Consider using laptop mounts or trays to save desk space and elevate the laptop positioning.\nLaptops have become powerful enough that for most people it's not necessary to own both a laptop and a desktop PC. However, you don't have to put up with the cramped work environment of a laptop when you're at your desk. Here's how I use my laptops as desktop computers.\nI Left Desktops Behind Long Ago\nThe last time I built and used a desktop PC for myself was in 2016, and though I still love the PC building scene, the circumstances of my work and lifestyle led me towards switching to laptops instead.\nI had discounted high-performance laptops until I was essentially forced to switch over thanks to my job, the need to move often for a few years, and ever more frequent power cuts in my home country were the main factors. This is when I realized that, while not as powerful as a desktop could be, these laptops were more than enough for my needs.\nI am now on my third desktop-replacement grade Windows laptop since making the switch, and my third MacBook, which is my daily driver work laptop. I've set up my desktop to use either of these laptops as I need them, so let's look at what I'm using.\nGet An External Monitor That\u2019s Also a USB Hub\nFor me, the hub of this entire setup is my Dell ultrawide monitor. I use a Dell S3422DWG. This has three display inputs, and can act as a USB hub. I use the USB hub functionality with my Windows laptop, since that's where I'm more likely to connect peripherals like my flight stick or racing wheel\nUsing the monitor with my MacBook is as simple as connecting an HDMI cable, but sadly, my monitor doesn't offer USB-C with power for laptops. When I next buy a primary monitor for my desk setup, that will be a key feature I look for.\nA Laptop That Can Run Safely With the Lid Closed\nMany people who use a laptop with a desk setup, will use the laptop's internal screen as a second monitor, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. However, if you want to have a desktop PC-like experience, you'll want to tuck the laptop somewhere out of sight.\nBoth my MacBook Pro and my Titan Computers workstation laptop (full disclosure, I received this laptop for free) are designed to work with the lid closed. Their vent systems don't vent out of the top when the lid is down. Now, I do know some MacBooks perform a little worse with the lid closed, but it won't hurt the machine, and you can always just open the lid if you have this happen.\nMy Desk Has Handy Shelves To Hide My Laptop\nI purposefully picked a desk that has these open shelves.\nThere are four of them in total. The one pictured above is where my Windows workstation laptop sits atop a laptop cooler. The cooler lets the laptop fans stay quieter under heavy loads.\nThe tier below it houses my Plex server.\nAnd then the leftmost shelf houses my MacBook, because that's the most convenient grab-and-go location. Using my Dell's multiple inputs, it's easy to just switch between these computers as I need them.\nMounted Laptop Stands Are a Great Option\nMy previous Windows laptop (An MSI GS66) made use of vents that are blocked when the laptop is closed. This meant that I could not tuck it out of sight. So, instead, I bought a laptop tray that worked with VESA monitor mounts, and treated the laptop like a mounted monitor.\nThis gets around the issue of the laptop taking up precious desk space, and elevated it to a more ergonomic position.\nThe Right Keyboard and Mouse Combo\nI've tried various peripherals over the years. In the above image I was using a Razer Tartarus Pro, with a Logitech K380 keyboard and a Logitech MX Master Mouse 3. I've since replaced the two keyboard devices with a single mechanical keyboard that can save three Bluetooth profiles, but I've kept the Master Mouse, and use a Lightspeed mouse from Logitech for gaming.\nThe point is that you need to pick the right peripherals to make your desktop-from-laptop experience go as smoothly as possible. For me, having mutiple Bluetooth profiles is important because I have to switch between mutiple computers, but either way a wireless mouse and keyboard makes it much easier to come and go with your laptop, or to tuck it away if you rarely have to unplug it.\nYou Don\u2019t Need a Docking Station (but They Are Awesome)\nI don't use a proper docking station\u2014dedicated devices that make the desktop switch easy\u2014but that's because my Monitor effectively does that job for me.\nHowever, if you don't have a monitor that can double as a docking station, they can be extremely convenient. Just plug in a single USB-C cable in many cases, and you'll have power and peripherals connected in one go.\nThat's what I've done to use my laptop like a desktop, but there are as many approaches as there are computer users, so take the time to concoct your own special blend of solutions to stretch your legs when you're not out and about."

      "text": "When one thinks about iconic design, there are certain products that instantly come to mind. The curvaceous lines of the Coca-Cola bottle. The smooth, enticing finish of the iPhone. The unforgettable, ageless profile of the Porsche 911 - the ThinkPad?!\nThe Porsche 911 and the ThinkPad: Icons of Timeless Design\nWhy are the Porsche 911 and the ThinkPad kindred spirits in design philosophy? The Porsche 911, with its teardrop rear end and frog-eyed headlights, is a design that refuses to age. It continues to capture hearts and minds like its computerized counterpart, the ThinkPad.\nThe ThinkPad, with its minimalist black box aesthetic, has kept a design language that seems to resist the passage of time. Just as the 911 is instantly recognizable, so is the ThinkPad with its signature TrackPoint (lovingly referred to as the \"nub\" by loyalists and a \"nipple\" by everyone else) nestled in the middle of the keyboard.\nMuch like Porsche with its 911, IBM (and now Lenovo) had chosen evolution over revolution with its ThinkPad design. The idea is simple: if it's not broken, why fix it? Both Porsche and Lenovo have focused on refining the successful elements of their respective products, leading to a product line that has remained iconic and loved through decades.\nInnovations: ThinkPad's Hidden Jewels\nThinkPads are not just about a nostalgic appeal. Beneath their seemingly plain exterior, they've been the canvas for some of the most innovative features in the world of laptops. The butterfly keyboard, for instance, introduced in the ThinkPad 701C, was a marvel of engineering. It was a full-sized keyboard that ingeniously expanded out when the laptop lid was opened and folded in on itself when closed, keeping the compact form factor intact.\nThen there was the ThinkPad TransNote, which included a digitizer pad for natural handwriting input, much before the likes of iPad Pro made it mainstream. It included a literal paper pad, and if you used the special digitizer pen, it would also transfer your pen strokes to an app on the laptop. Another fascinating innovation was the ThinkPad W700ds, a laptop with an integrated secondary screen that could slide out when needed.\nThe list goes on. They were among the first to introduce laptops with integrated fingerprint readers, \"roll cages\" for extra durability, or screens that could work with overhead projectors. This marriage of forward-thinking features with a design that values function over form has earned the ThinkPad its cult status.\nThe Cult of ThinkPad\nThe ThinkPad fandom can seem baffling to outsiders. After all, why would anyone opt for a laptop that clings to an aesthetic reminiscent of the 90s, when there are numerous slick and sleek options available?\nFor many, IT professionals in particular, the appeal lies in the rugged durability and utilitarian design that these laptops offer. They are built like tanks and meant to withstand the rigors of professional life with aplomb. The keyboards are often hailed as the best in the industry, offering a tactile experience that is a dream come true for prolific typists. To a corporate IT technician or big-business software developer walking the trenches of a data center, a ThinkPad is the equivalent of the army M4 to a soldier. It's not fancy, but it always gets the job done.\nThe TrackPoint, as odd as it may seem to the uninitiated, allows for precise cursor control without having to move your hands off the keyboard, making it a beloved feature among the ThinkPad loyalists. These are virtually the only laptops sold today that still use this pointing device, with everyone else happy to have just a touchpad.\nJust as Porsche 911 drivers swear by the distinctive driving feel and the unique rear-engine layout of their machines, ThinkPad users adore the unique features and uncompromising quality of their \"ugly\" black boxes.\nThe 'Porsche 911' of Laptops\nSo, the ThinkPad is the Porsche 911 of laptops. Both have stayed true to their design languages and evolved gradually over the years. They've both built cult-like followings that thrive on the unique offerings of their beloved products. And just as the 911 remains a timeless representation of performance and design, the ThinkPad is a testament to the beauty of functionality and longevity.\nWhile design trends may come and go, the ThinkPad \u2013 just like the Porsche 911 \u2013 holds steadfast, continuing to enamor its loyal fanbase with its unique blend of function, form, and relentless innovation. It serves as a reminder that sometimes, when you get it right, there's no need for change for the sake of change. I fully expect to see the classic design of the ThinkPad outlive every laptop design that's fashionable today.\nNeed more convincing? David Hill, Lenovo's Chief Design Officer and the man we have to thank for the iconic and enduring good looks of the ThinkPad agrees. He noticed when this article was published and noted in a tweet that he'd been making the comparison between ThinkPad and the Porsche 911 design continuity for decades. It's a testament to how well his department executed that vision that over thirty years after the ThinkPad came out we can continue to make the comparison and enjoy the iconic styling of the ThinkPad line."
