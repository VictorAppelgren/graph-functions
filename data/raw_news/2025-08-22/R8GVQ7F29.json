  "description": "AI augments workforces; success lies in thoughtful, human-centered integration",
  "content": "Few technological shifts have generated as much excitement and anxiety as the introduction of artificial intelligence in the workplace.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing a marked step forward in the innovation and wider integration of AI tools as standard across all sectors and industries, driven by promises of streamlining, productivity gain, and growth opportunities.\n\nThis transformation is marked by both decision-makers\u2019 eagerness to harness the full potential of AI and employees\u2019 fears about job security.\n\nDespite the demonstrable potential of enterprise AI tools, it\u2019s important that companies deploy them incrementally, rather than actioning disruptive overhauls. A \u201crip and replace\u201d mindset could result in internal resistance and operational disruption. Gradual integration will enable greater flexibility and alignment with strategic and technical goals.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen first-hand how companies have failed to properly implement AI tools, for instance with Klarna in early 2024. Klarna aggressively automated customer support, introducing AI agents to handle huge workloads in place of humans. This led to poor customer experiences, and a public admission that overreliance on cost-cutting was a mistake. The human touch proved irreplaceable for complex human queries.\n\nSimilarly, there\u2019s the risk of businesses falling into the trap of viewing AI as a one-size-fits-all solution, lured by the prospects of increased efficiency and decreased costs. Without a clear assessment of foundational challenges, like fragmented data and how to integrate with legacy systems, AI initiatives can hinder rather than deliver results.\n\nInstead, organizations should turn their focus to integrating AI deliberately with existing IT infrastructure, at points where it\u2019s truly able to add value. Targeted, measured deployments will unlock efficiencies that mesh with existing operational strategy and mitigate the chances of disruption.\n\nThere\u2019s one key thing that\u2019s overlooked in much of the discourse suggesting AI is replacing jobs: the simple fact that AI success depends on the humans that shape, supervise and steer AI output.\n\nThink of it not as a substitute for human intelligence, but as an augmentor capable of transforming ideas into actionable results. To this end, the more that AI is implemented, the greater the potential productivity benefit, but the greater the need for accountability as well.\n\nAccountability \u2014 and demonstrated adherence to ethical and legal guidelines \u2014 requires human oversight and judgement. Far from making human employees obsolete, widespread AI rollout is creating new demands for human expertise and a whole cache of professions.\n\nThis will only become the case by way of mass AI adoption. Which itself can only happen with the emergence of zero- and low-code platforms. The goal is to make powerful IT automation tools accessible to non-technical teams.\n\nThis way, employees with specific domain expertise can devise tailored AI systems, and become active shapers of AI-infused business innovation.\n\nThis level of collaboration will reveal insights that otherwise might stay hidden in siloed processes, combining automation with deep and involved operational understanding.\n\nIt\u2019s not about replacing talent: it\u2019s about identifying it and finding ways of amplifying it to unlock smarter, more adaptive ways of working.\n\nRecognizing value is value in itself\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about AI freeing up employees for high-value tasks, but what qualifies as \u201chigh value\u201d is far from universal. A task deemed critical in healthcare might be routine in retail.\n\nPrecision might matter most in one industry, where creativity may trump it in others. The reality is: value is subjective and sector-specific, which is why one-size-fits-all actually fits none.\n\nThe companies that treat this question strategically, rather than a bolt-on, are the ones that will gain a competitive edge and extract the most value from their AI deployments.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer about what AI can take over, but what it should.\n\nEking out a definition should sit beside broader business priorities: deciding where human focus belongs will be imperative to business success. In an AI-enabled future, the ability to evaluate what matters most will become one of the highest-value capabilities of all.\n\nIn short, AI won\u2019t kill jobs, but lazy thinking might. The real threat isn\u2019t the tech itself, but how it\u2019s deployed. Businesses that chase efficiency at the expense of human insight risk shedding expertise. The message for decision makers is clear: equip people, don\u2019t replace them \u2014 and you don\u2019t just keep up, you lead.\n\nWe list the best IT management tools.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Spiceworks offers direct support to free users, which is a notable advantage. However, it doesn\u2019t offer as many infrastructure management features as you\u2019ll get with the other services on this list.\nWe've also featured the best cloud orchestration services.\nBest IT infrastructure management service FAQs\nHow to choose an IT infrastructure management service\nCost\nPricing is the first thing to consider when choosing any platform. Different IT infrastructure management services have different costs, and you need to pick one that suits your budget. Pricing usually depends on how many devices your organization operates and its custom technical infrastructure.\nYou should estimate beforehand what you expect to pay and ensure it\u2019s a price you can afford in the long term. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs, e.g., extra support costs as some software vendors charge.\nCustomer support\nCustomer service is another critical aspect of any software platform. You need a platform with a good reputation in this consideration. This way, you can always seek help from knowledgeable support personnel when an inevitable bug or glitch arises. You should also have access to detailed documentation that you can consult when facing any issues.\nEase of use\nYou need a tool that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that your IT staff can easily work around. Any platform that\u2019s challenging to use is bound to cause frustration and potentially costly mistakes.\nEssential features of an IT Infrastructure Management service\n1. Real-Time Monitoring\nYour management service should allow you to monitor every IT component in real time. You should be able to look at the state of every device connected to your network from a central dashboard. This way, you can easily identify which device is having any issues, e.g., a server that has gone down or a route that\u2019s not resolving to the internet.\nYou should also be able to receive alerts and notifications when specific issues occur. For example, the platform can automatically ping your mobile phone when a critical server is down.\n2. Automation\nThe platform should enable you to automate some of your important IT maintenance tasks. For example, you should be able to automatically deploy software updates for every server or PC connected to your network. Similarly, you should be able to adjust server loads according to customer demand; this feature ensures your infrastructure is always ready to deliver when there\u2019s a traffic spike.\n3. Integration\nThe platform should facilitate seamless integration between your IT and workplace collaboration tools. For example, you can integrate it with Slack so that you\u2019ll receive an alert on the app when a critical component is down. Third-party integrations make infrastructure management easier for your IT staff.\nMore IT infrastructure management services\nThe best IT infrastructure management services make it simple and easy to manage and administrate IT tasks without compromising security.\nThis is important, because managing your IT infrastructure can be a challenge. Servers, cloud services, and business applications- working with them as an integrated whole can be complicated, and made worse if you inevitably have legacy software systems running as well.\nThen there are infrastructure-specific needs such as APM tools, DevOps, SecOps, as well as general ITSM tools, and CMMS software.\nHowever, there are solutions available that can map your full IT infrastructure to the cloud, allowing you to monitor everything from a single dashboard. This can display everything from the different OS, software versions, and storage use, as well as provide malware protection as part of endpoint security and even monitor energy consumption and costs.\nMore importantly, a good infrastructure management solution (IMS) will allow you to pinpoint bottlenecks through network monitoring, allowing you to zoom into any code causing errors, allowing you to identify workarounds and solutions. Usually alerts can also be provided in the event of any technical failure, allowing you to react quickly via push notifications, SMS, email, or even automated calls.\nIt doesn't stop there - why have your IMS work as a standalone? Often integrations are available to enhance team communications, collaboration, and even work with the best CRM software platforms so that you can ensure everyone in the business cycle affected by an issue can be kept updated, and notified once a solution is in place.\nHow we tested the best IT infrastructure management service\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

The AI system can even tag and prioritize tickets for the IT staff to handle.\nYou can generate automation scripts using Atera's AI system. The platform comes with over 1,000 ready-made scripts but you can generate additional ones. Atera gives you deep visibility into all devices connected to your network, and you can automate software updates and patches.\nThis tool is very user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. It also has mobile apps, which makes it convenient to use on the go.\nRead our full Atera review.\nBest IT Automation software for Azure users\n5. Microsoft System Center\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCloud computing is a major part of IT operations nowadays. Many enterprises are migrating from on-premise IT infrastructure to the cloud, and Microsoft Azure is one of the main cloud computing providers they choose.\nMicrosoft's System Center makes it easy to control and manage your IT infrastructure. You can manage all your Azure infrastructure from one place and automate a lot of tasks. For example, you can automatically monitor and troubleshoot your servers at specific periods to detect any issues before they morph into something more serious. You can allocate virtual machines depending on demand instead of renting unnecessary server space with hopes of future demand.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a free plan for System Center, which is a disadvantage. Pricing can also run up to thousands of dollars annually, which makes it suitable for large organizations with significant IT budgets.\nA good thing about System Center is that it also enables you to manage on-premise IT infrastructure (servers and PCs) and not just cloud-based ones only.\nBest IT automation tool FAQs\nHow to choose an IT automation platform\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. You need to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Pricing for automation tools usually depends on the number of tasks and how big your IT infrastructure is, so it should be easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay beforehand. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs and check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the features before making your final decision.\nEase of use\nYour automation platform should be easy to use and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that a layman can understand. Complex interfaces can frustrate users and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to solve your issues. Ensure you choose an IT automation platform with a solid reputation regarding customer service; check user reviews to confirm this. You should be able to contact a human support representative via email, telephone, or live chat when you need one. You should also have access to additional support resources such as user guides and video tutorials.\nEssential features of an IT automation tool\n1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software. You can also automatically check for viruses and security bugs and deploy fixes immediately.\nEndpoint management automation makes IT management much easier for everyone, especially in large organizations.\nHow we tested the best IT automation tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service.

      "text": "Best employee management software of 2025\nHere we review the best employee management software to make management a breeze for your HR function.\nManaging employees is crucial to long-term organizational success. Effective employee management can help optimize human capital performance, improve employee experience and satisfaction, and reduce employee turnover and associated costs. It also helps organizations align their own goals with those of their employees \u2013 an important requirement to promote mutual development.\nAn employee management platform lets you manage important employee functions such as payroll, time and attendance management, conduct various surveys, and communicate effectively with your employees. You can also create various automated workflows to streamline redundant HR tasks.\nHowever, with so many employee management tools around, choosing the perfect one for your organization's needs can be difficult. We\u2019ve dug in to find the 5 best employee management software, each with unique offerings.\nWe've also featured the best employee monitoring software.\nThe best employee management software in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRippling is one of the most comprehensive employee management solutions with a complete suite of HR modules, including performance management, benefits management, time and attendance, global employment modules, and payroll management, among others.\nOrganizations with an international workforce would love Rippling\u2019s Global Payroll solution. You can process global payments in as few as 5 days when most global aggregators need 15-20 days to do the same. Plus, you can pay all your employees in their local currencies without worrying about conversion rates \u2013 Rippling takes care of that. The best part? Rippling also calculates and files payroll taxes as applicable in other countries for you. This takes a huge burden off the HR shoulders.\nRippling has a robust time and attendance management module. For starters, your employees can clock in from anywhere \u2013 whether on a desk or on-site, through a tablet kiosk, Rippling web login, or mobile app. Plus, you can set geolocation restrictions that would not allow an employee to clock in if they are too far from the office or the site. To prevent buddy punching, you can even activate selfie logins and QR code logins.\nNext, managers can see all the live clock-in details on a single dashboard, You also have the freedom to design your own custom time rules or even send and receive alerts. Let\u2019s say you want to be notified when any employee goes into overtime. You can simply set up a custom alert from the dashboard to do so. Once approved, all of this time data automatically flows into Rippling\u2019s Payroll module. After that, you can run payroll in a matter of minutes.\nThe Payroll dashboard allows managers to control elements like custom deductions, reimbursements, garnishment payments, and so on. Once you\u2019ve run the payroll, Rippling will automatically make entries into your accounting software through its powerful integration.\nRippling Pulse is a dedicated module used to build and send engaging employee surveys that can be used to measure satisfaction. The best part is that you can automate these surveys based on specific events. Let\u2019s say you want to conduct exit surveys for outgoing employees. You can build a survey and then send it out automatically to employees whose end date is tomorrow. Similarly, you can send onboarding surveys to employees who have joined three days back. These time-based automations ensure that you do not miss out on critical HR processes.\nTo support all of its functions, Rippling offers various templates, which it calls \u201crecipes\u201d. There are templates for almost all HR functions. Some popular recipes include a payroll journal report template, FSA enrolment template, unsigned document reminders, employee anniversary notifications, PTO request notifications, and much more. These recipes save a lot of time in designing common workflows that all organizations usually need.\nRead our Rippling employee management review\nBest international\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeel takes global team management a notch higher with its exceptional EOR services. Deel has entities in 100+ countries and a dedicated onboarding team with 200+ local HR and legal experts who make sure you\u2019re in compliance at all times. Everything from hiring and onboarding to payroll is handled by Deel experts. You just need to make a bulk payment every month, and Deel will take care of taxes and deductions. The platform also offers an immigration support plan wherein local immigration experts from 25 countries will handle the visa legwork for you.\nNowadays, salaries are not enough to attract top talent. That\u2019s why most organizations now offer equity to deserving employees. But what if these employees are international? How would you calculate the taxes in this case? This is where Deel steps in \u2013 it recommends the best form of equity, such as NSOs, RTUs, SARs, and Phantom stocks, depending on the local tax laws of different countries. Simply reach out to a Deel expert, provide them with all the details, and they\u2019ll help you with the best course of action.\nAnother challenge associated with global employees is equipment management \u2013 procuring, allotting, and setting up devices can take a lot of time and effort. However, Deel\u2019s partnership with Hofy makes this easy for you. Select from 400+ equipment options available on Deel\u2019s platform, and Hofy will take care of the formalities, such as customs and shipping documents. You\u2019ll be notified when the device is delivered to your employee abroad. Plus, you get a lifetime device warranty and 24/7 expert IT assistance.\nNext up is Deel\u2019s background check. While it is possible to carry out background checks for local employees, doing so for a global workforce can be difficult. Simply request a check through Deel, with a quick turnaround time. Moreover, Deel is compliant with various standards such as GDPR, SOC 2, SOC 3, and ISO.\nAnother benefit Deel extends is their coworking spaces. It has as many as 700 locations across 38 countries with access to conferencing tools, high-speed Wi-Fi, and other hot desk tools. Thus, you can provide your remote employees with an office-like environment.\nWhat\u2019s more? Deel also has a free-forever plan for teams of up to 200 members, which makes it an ideal pick for small and growing businesses and startups. You can create custom and automated workflows and several integrations, such as accounting, expense, and payroll. You can also generate various HR reports, collect custom documents safely, and view and change organization charts.\nRead our Deel review\nBest communication\n3. Connecteam\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nConnecteam is the best solution if you are an organization with a lot of remote employees. Let\u2019s accept it \u2013 employee communications are not always interesting. But with Connecteam, you can design social media feeds like updates for your employees. You can add GIFs and images to your announcements, allow or disallow comments, and add company branding. It comes in handy for creating employee polls, sharing important work links, and even recognizing employees for their good work. Managers can also track if anyone hasn\u2019t viewed the update and send them custom notifications.\nClearly, Connecteam focuses more on employee communication. It\u2019s evident with its Work Chat app \u2013 a business chat solution that lets employees and managers interact with each other and create broadcast channels or company-wide groups. You can even share files, images, and other important documents. This helps separate your work from your personal life \u2013 all your work-related stuff will be in a separate app altogether.\nConnecteam\u2019s task management is another feature you\u2019ll love. Sure, other management platforms also provide this feature, but we love how simple Connecteam has made it. Managers can create new tasks within a matter of seconds, add files to the task, and set start and due dates. Employees will be notified immediately that a new task has been assigned to them. Managers will receive notification when the employees view the task and once they have completed it. Plus, managers can view the live status of all tasks assigned to employees from a single dashboard, send nudges, and ask for updates \u2013 all from a single location.\nJust like Rippling, Connecteam also has a robust time and attendance management feature. You can track live time, get alerts for overtime, and set geo-restrictions. But, Connecteam goes a step ahead with its Shift scheduling, something that\u2019s only available on a third-party integration with Rippling. You can assign shifts to all your employees, view their availability, and create reusable templates. You can even create open shifts for employees to claim. Employees have the freedom to trade shifts with approvals, set their availability, and request time-offs.\nHowever, a feature the platform lacks is robust payroll management. You have to rely on third-party integrations and tedious XLS and PDF files to process payrolls with Connecteam. But it more than makes up for it with its intuitive and easy-to-use app, which is certainly one of the best in the industry.\nBest sourcing and recruitment\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAre you on a hiring spree and looking to fill multiple roles with the best candidates possible? Paycor\u2019s Smart Sourcing is just what you need. It is an AI-based sourcing tool that searches through a huge database of active and passive job seekers to find and communicate with the best-suited candidates for a specific role.\nWith this single tool, you can expand your search, engage with candidates, and filter them based on various parameters. It saves a lot of HR time and cost that would have otherwise been used to interview non-deserving candidates. All the data sorted by Paycor\u2019s Smart Sourcing module flows into its recruitment dashboard, where you can create custom hiring workflows based on your specific needs.\nPaycor also offers a robust timekeeping and tracking solution with various options, such as Wi-Fi connectivity, PIN entry, badge proximity entry, and a multi-language badge reader for accurate time recording. You can make policy-based custom rules to automate the whole process and even connect your payroll function to eliminate duplicate entries and improve accuracy.\nTo complement timekeeping, Paycor also offers on-the-go shift scheduling functions. You can plan shifts right from your mobile and send real-time updates to all employees. Just like time management, you can set custom rules here as well. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve assigned 4 hours of rest for every employee each week.\nSo, Paycor won\u2019t let you schedule a shift of the employee if the mandated rest hours have not been completed yet. These automations can be difficult to manage manually. Employees can even set their own availability and even swap shifts among them.\nExpense management is another area that takes a lot of HR resources. Collecting, verifying, and paying out employee reimbursements can be an ordeal. That\u2019s where Paycor\u2019s expense management, which is integrated into its HR and payroll modules, saves the day.\nEmployees can submit their expense receipts through the Paycor app. They will get real-time notification of any policy violations so that they can correct them before submitting. Managers get real-time updates of the requests. Once approved, these flow automatically to the Paycor payroll module so that you don\u2019t have to rely on third-party integrations. The Paycor app allows you to even record mileage details with its in-app trip tracking. Thus, Paycor acts as a one-stop solution to all employee management needs.\nBest survey and data collection\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBambooHR offers a host of employee management tools. Its management module is divided into three parts \u2013 manager and self-assessment, peer feedback, and goals. Manager assessments are made easy with just four objective questions per employee. If you do need some industry-specific data, you can add up to three custom questions.\nManagers can choose two peers to give feedback to a particular employee. They are also asked just two questions to keep things simple. Plus, the feedback can only be seen by the manager, maintaining confidentiality.\nBambooHR allows both employees and managers to set goals, which can be assessed at all times. Employees can also choose to create a shared goal, which will show in the goals tab of each employee. Managers can view all the goals of their employees and can choose to align one with their own goals to ensure everyone is on the same page.\nBambooHR analytics are also pretty comprehensive. The employee performance report gives insights into each employee\u2019s performance and feedback and shows their level of engagement. The company performance report shows how the organization is doing as a whole. I absolutely loved the goals status report, where managers can track the progress of each employee\u2019s goals from a single dashboard.\nAnother handy feature BambooHR has is its pre-built approval workflows, such as updates in employee information, promotion requests, and time-off requests. You can also create custom workflows with up to five approval levels, and choose an approval chain, either by location, department, or division. This makes sure that the approval is processed by the right person.\nEmployee satisfaction is another area where BambooHR excels with its eNPS surveys with anonymous feedback. Now, there are some additional features that make this survey absolutely unbeatable. BambooHR offers smart keyword tagging features that pick out important keywords mentioned in employee feedback. It then creates a report of these keywords, highlighting the positives and the negatives.\nFor example, some keywords might include Compensation, Company Culture, Leadership, Benefits, Ethics, and so on. These keywords will then be segregated into the top 5 likes and dislikes so that you have a bird\u2019s eye view of the areas you need to improve.\nBambooHR also has an Employee Wellbeing module- a survey tool that focuses on intangible employee aspects such as happiness, relationships, personal motivators, and company motivators. Each category has several well-researched questions you can pick from so that you can send out surveys with different questions each time. Employees need to answer these questions on a 6-point Likert scale so that you can collect concrete answers.\nPlus, employees have the option to leave a comment on each question. Once the data is collected, you can view them all on the well-being record, which shows transitions in employees\u2019 emotional health over time. You can even filter data by department, division, location, and so on.\nRead our BambooHR review\nBest customer support integration\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nA popular service across the world with some big names using it, Zendesk is a powerful and versatile software. The service offers solutions for all kinds of businesses, regardless of size.\nThere\u2019s plenty to like here, with the service\u2019s powerful internal help desk or the great Sunshine CRM that comes with a bunch of features. Zendesk also offers some very neat customer support integrations. You can add a phone, email, live chat, or online ticket, and you can create your very own personalized knowledge base.\nAs for the software itself, the interface will vary depending on your choice of product, but you shouldn\u2019t have any issues no matter what you pick, as the software is designed in a way not to have any cluttered space while still providing relevant information.\nRegarding security, Zendesk has a dedicated security page where you can see how serious they are about taking care of customers and their privacy. Most of Zendesk\u2019s service data is managed by Amazon Web Services, which also means they take full advantage of Amazon\u2019s infrastructure. Worth noting is that the system supports a credit card field that complies with PCI standards, concealing all digits except for the final four, and enhancing security measures against fraudulent activities.\nThere are several pricing plans available depending on your needs, with the most basic one starting at $19 per agent/month, and the suite plans starting at $55 per agent/month.\nRead our Zendesk review.\nBest features\n7. Remote\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRemote.com is an employee management software ideal for those looking for a wide array of features. The software includes contractor management, global payroll, EOR, and HRIS (human resources information system) which allows you to manage the entire global workplace in one place.\nIn addition, there\u2019s a remote API that allows you to easily share global employee data across platforms, and \u2018remote talent\u2019 that helps you find the right candidates for any roles you might have. This feature is basically another product as it has plenty of options and its own pricing.\nSpeaking of pricing, Remote has several options and even a free one. The HRIS plan is free and has several features of note, including guided onboarding and offboarding, employee profile and document management, time and attendance (time off and tracking), and a few more.\nThe Contractor Management plan is priced at $29 per month per contractor, and it allows you to work with contractors in over 200 countries, create, edit, and sign tailored localized contracts, and more. Also, you only pay for contractors you actively work with. Furthermore, there\u2019s a \u2018plus\u2019 version of this plan, which is priced at $99 per month per contractor, and it\u2019s pretty much the same, except you get an added indemnity coverage.\nThen, you have the EOR plan, which is quite expensive, starting at $599 per month. There are zero onboarding or offboarding fees in this one, and there\u2019s built-in security and compliance.\nLastly, those interested in global payroll will have to pay $50 per month per employee.\nWe've also featured the best employee scheduling software.\nFAQs\nWhich is the best employee management software?\nRippling is the best employee management software you can get. Its global HR and Payroll solutions help you manage an international workforce with ease. There is an entire HR Cloud suite that will help you streamline various HR processes such as onboarding, recruiting, performance management, time and attendance management, headcount planning, and more. You can even conduct and automate various employee surveys to gather and work on critical employee data.\nHow to choose the best employee management software?\nChoosing the best employee management software includes determining how easy the software is to use. The learning curve must not be a sharp one, and it should be easy to adapt to all the features it has to offer. Plus, you should have access to customer support that can guide you through the software. The platform must be scalable, i.e., as your employee strength grows, you should not be forced to switch providers. The current one should accommodate all your needs.\nHow much does employee management software cost?\nYou can expect to get employee management software from anywhere between $25-$100 per month, depending on the features you need and the number of employees you have. However, most platforms (like Rippling and BambooHR) are not transparent about their pricing. You\u2019ll have to contact a salesperson to get a custom quote for your specific needs.\nIs there free employee management software?\nDeel HR is the best free employee management software with features like workflow automation, organization charts, expense management, time off, and bonus management. It is sufficient for a small entity with a handful of employees (less than 20). However, if you have a large organization with complex compliance requirements, getting paid management software is highly recommended.\nHow we test\nEmployee management software comes in various shapes and sizes, and choosing the best ones isn\u2019t an easy task. We\u2019ve used our years of industry knowledge and strict measuring criteria to handpick the best management solutions for all your needs. First, we assessed all the features these software offers. The features must not only be on paper but actually provide ground-level utility. All of our featured software provides value-for-money features that\u2019ll actually help you streamline your HR processes.\nNext, we consider the ease of use. An employee management software must be easy to understand and use. A complex platform will take up more time and resources to comprehend and become a hindrance in day-to-day use. Thus, all of our recommended platforms have an intuitive user interface and a shorter learning curve.\nWe also considered the extent of reports and data these platforms can generate. After all, management involves drawing and acting upon meaningful employee data. If you\u2019re not able to measure metrics like employee motivation and satisfaction, it becomes difficult to drive performance. That\u2019s why all our platforms can generate extensive reports on various parameters so that you can make meaningful decisions.\nLastly, we consider how scalable the platform is. As your number of employees increases, your current platform should be able to accommodate your growing needs, and you should not be forced to change providers. All of our employee management solutions are capable of handling diverse workforce needs, from less than 20 employees to more than thousands.\nWe've also featured the best employee monitoring software.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "AI is already working for your people - now it\u2019s time to make it work for the business\nEmployees are embracing AI, but leadership lags behind in strategy\nArtificial intelligence (AI) isn\u2019t something on the horizon. It\u2019s already part of how people are getting work done.\nRecent research from HP and YouGov found that 72% of UK employees using AI tools say it saves them time every week. One in ten are saving more than five hours. Some are using it to reduce manual admin. Others say it helps them focus, collaborate more effectively, or feel more in control of their day.\nBut these gains aren\u2019t coming from structured enterprise rollouts. In many cases, they\u2019re the result of quiet experimentation - employees using what\u2019s already at their fingertips, often without training or direction from IT.\nSVP, Northwest Europe at HP.\nAt the same time, more than a quarter of UK businesses still report having no formal AI strategy. This creates a growing disconnect: employees are forging ahead on their own, while the organization risks falling behind. It\u2019s not a technology gap; it\u2019s a leadership one.\nIn my conversations with CIOs and IT leaders across the UK and wider Northwest Europe market, I hear a mix of urgency and uncertainty. Everyone agrees AI is critical to future competitiveness. But there are open questions around where to start, how to scale responsibly, and how to balance experimentation with governance.\nThat hesitation is understandable, especially in industries where risk and compliance frameworks are tight. But as more teams adopt AI organically, the absence of a centralized plan introduces its own risks - from data leakage to inconsistent performance and lost opportunities for enterprise-wide value.\nA rare opportunity to re-architect from the ground up\nThe end of Windows 10 support in 2025 presents a strategic window. Many organizations are already reviewing their device strategies and digital estate planning. This moment, whether viewed as a compliance trigger or a chance to modernize, is an ideal time to align IT infrastructure decisions with longer-term goals around workplace tools and AI integration.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWe\u2019re seeing growing interest in AI-capable endpoint devices as part of that strategy. These systems offer local processing, reduced latency, and better data control-critical features for organizations managing hybrid environments or strict regulatory requirements. But while improved performance and privacy are important, the real benefit is this: AI becomes embedded, accessible, and usable without disrupting the way people already work.\nI\u2019ve spoken with IT leaders who are introducing AI incrementally through use cases that matter to employees: summarizing meetings, creating first drafts, reducing clicks. It doesn\u2019t need to be complex to be effective, but it does need to be intentional.\nFrom pilot mode to platform mindset\nToo many organizations remain stuck in test-and-wait mode. A pilot project goes well, but momentum fizzles. There\u2019s no clear business owner, no framework to expand, no metrics to track long-term impact. Here, AI remains confined to one team or workflow, useful but limited.\nTo unlock real value, businesses need to stop thinking in projects and start thinking in systems. That means moving AI out of isolated pockets and into the core of IT and business strategy. From what I\u2019ve seen across sectors, this shift requires three mindset changes.\nFirst, move from experimentation to prioritization. AI isn\u2019t a side initiative anymore. It needs sponsorship, resourcing, and KPIs tied to outcomes the organization cares about - whether that\u2019s productivity, cost savings, or faster decision-making.\nSecond, move from scattered adoption to secure design. Governance, data privacy, and accountability must be built in from the beginning. In regulated industries, this is non-negotiable. But even in more flexible sectors, employees need to know where AI fits and what the boundaries are.\nThird, move from short-term rollout to long-term enablement. AI success isn\u2019t about deployment alone. It\u2019s about building trust, training users, and supporting adoption in ways that stick. That means investing in support infrastructure-not just software licenses.\nSome of the most effective CIOs I\u2019ve worked with are building cross-functional AI working groups that bring together IT, data, ops, HR, and business units. These teams aren\u2019t just coordinating rollouts-they\u2019re shaping roadmaps, reviewing risks, and evolving policies together. That kind of alignment isn\u2019t flashy, but it\u2019s what allows AI to move from tactical to transformative.\nAI that works - for people and the business\nBeyond the tech stack, there\u2019s a broader benefit to consider. In the same HP and YouGov research, AI users reported lower stress, improved work-life balance, and greater satisfaction with their roles. When implemented well, AI doesn\u2019t just make work faster, it makes it more manageable and more meaningful. That translates into retention, productivity, and culture shifts that directly affect the bottom line.\nAs IT leaders, we don\u2019t just manage systems, we shape environments. Our job is to build the foundations that allow people to do their best work. And increasingly, that means designing ecosystems where AI can be adopted confidently, used securely, and evolved sustainably.\nThe momentum is already there. Employees are experimenting. The tools are ready. The opportunity now is to implement structure and take those individual wins and build a strategy that turns them into lasting, measurable impact.\nWe list the best employee management software and the best employee experience tool.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

So instead of repackaging PR blurbs and feature checklists, I decided to actually try them.\nThis guide is the result of hundreds of hours spent signing up, testing features, running real workflows, and figuring out which AI tools actually help get work done, across every major use case I could think of.\nI went deep into each tool, from image generation to email automation, chatbot building to scheduling assistants. TechRadar's team and I have personally tested every tool in this guide. So, let\u2019s get right into it.\nBest AI website builder tools\nWhen it comes to AI website builder tools, Hostinger is a standout.

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help.

Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading.

With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts.

Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions. Its AI assistant helps with writing follow-ups, searching across meetings, or drafting ideas post-call. The free plan includes 10 meetings/month.

Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams. With support for 100+ languages, smart filters, and deep integrations with CRMs and project tools, it becomes more than just a transcription tool.

Notion AI\n- What is it: An all-in-one AI assistant built into Notion for writing, research, task planning, and workspace queries.\n- Ideal for: Notion power users, content teams, students, or managers who want AI help across notes, databases, and documents.\nPart of Notion workspace, Notion\u2019s AI helps you summarize, reformat, translate, brainstorm, and get answers from your notes without switching tools.\nI used Notion to tidy up a messy project doc, pull action items from team sync notes, and turn revision material into a toggle-style quiz guide\nUnlike regular AI notetakers, Notion is context-aware. Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords. It scans the entire page, or even your whole workspace, to understand what matters. Then it delivers a clear, relevant answer.\nYou can even narrow that search to a specific doc, database, or tagged goal using @mentions. It also pulls content from connected tools like Google Drive or Slack and adds citations when needed.\n\u2705 You already use Notion as your main workspace: Notion AI is built into the tools you\u2019re already using, from notes to docs to calendars.\n\u2705 You want an all-in-one AI assistant: It handles writing, editing, summarizing, translating, and even extracting data from other tools.\n\u2705 You need workspace-level search: Ask it to find updates, draft pages, or summarize anything across your workspace.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Notion at all: It only works inside Notion, so it won\u2019t help with external docs or tools unless integrated.\n\u274c You need a perfect structure every time: Some summaries or tables need edits to match your format or tone.\nThere\u2019s also an AI Chat that works like a workspace-wide command center. It runs on GPT\u20114 and Claude to help with prompts or planning. I asked for a 5K training schedule and got a full week-by-week plan with toggles.\nIf you're not sure where to begin, the Notion templates gallery is worth checking out. It comes with a bunch of pre-built layouts for everything from meeting notes and study planners to editorial calendars and startup CRMs. You can add a template, then ask AI to help you populate or personalize it instantly.\nSome features still need polishing. The study tools often require manual edits, and summaries may lose detail unless you specify it to keep the original phrasing.\nBest AI assistant for Notion users who want writing, search, and task help\nNotion brings AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude straight into your Notion docs, making it perfect for summarizing, brainstorming, writing, and workspace querying. It helps you clean up text, generate tasks, build custom dashboards, or auto-fill databases. A free trial is available in all accounts.

It further helps in fine-tuning of stability, clarity, and style exaggeration simply by generation speed and output quality for optimal results.\nEleven Labs offers two levels of voice cloning. Instant Voice Cloning needs just a few minutes of audio to create a high-quality clone quickly. Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage.\nFor instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots . This could prove expensive for you if you want extensive voice synthesis and have a tight budget.\n2.

Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2. Microsoft translator\nGiving cut-throat competition to Google, Microsoft also has a translation service of its own. The Microsoft Translator provides text, voice, and document translation across multiple languages. In our opinion, you\u2019ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft\u2019s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time.\nMicrosoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite. This helps businesses to integrate translation capabilities into their applications, call centers, and multilingual conversational agents, all of which help in smooth and efficient communication with global customers.\nDuring our test, we used a feature called \"Live Transcribe\" that can transcribe speech in real time. This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4. DeepL\nDeepL is an AI-powered translation service famous for its accurate translations and careful focus on language nuances. It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

For example, if you're describing a cat, you might specify it like \u201cIt's a black cat with green eyes\u201d. Lastly, you need to mention the details about the setting or background. This could be something like \"a black cat with green eyes sitting on a chair in a living room.\"\nHow can you use AI?\nThe main purpose of AI is to automate repetitive tasks, so you can focus on more complex and creative work. For example, in manufacturing, AI-powered robots perform assembly line operations, so fewer manual labor is required. In customer support, AI chatbots can handle basic inquiries, providing instant responses, which helps agents focus on more complicated issues.\nOverall, AI can be used to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and support better decision-making across various industries. By using AI's power, you can gain a competitive edge and achieve greater operational efficiency.\nHow can you make an AI tool?\nTo make an AI tool, you need to start with identifying the specific purpose or problem it will solve. In your case, this could be automating a task, providing customer support, or analyzing data trends. Once you have goal, gather the necessary data to train the AI model. The data you collect should be clean, well-organized, and labeled properly for accurate training.\nNext, choose an AI framework to build your tool. Popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch offer the resources needed to design and train AI models. Once found, you can then design and train your AI model, adjusting hyperparameters as needed for optimal performance.\nMoreover, testing and validation are crucial, so test your AI tool performs in real-world scenarios. This will help you check the accuracy and reliability of your tool. Finally, after successful testing, you can then deploy your AI tool within your application or platform while making sure it meets safety and privacy standards.\nOnce ready, do regular monitoring of your AI tool's performance and make improvements as needed. Also, update it with new data to keep it effective and relevant in the current changing environment.\nHow to choose the best AI tools\nTo choose the best AI tools, look for the ones that offer features you need, such as customization, integration, scalability, and multilingual support. A user-friendly interface makes sure it's easy to use, while integration capabilities are important for compatibility with softwares like Microsoft, Google, or Amazon.\nYou also need to make sure the tool complies with safety and privacy standards like GDPR, and SSL encryption. To make sure the tool fits your budget, check the pricing structure, and consider free trials for assessment. Lastly, choose a tool that has a strong community support and responsive customer service.\nHow we tested the best AI tools\nWhile testing an AI tool, we start by understanding what we need the AI tool to accomplish. This includes identifying the main use cases and features we expect the tool to deliver, such as data analysis, automation, or customer support.\nOur team then conducts hands-on testing by running real-world scenarios to test the AI tool's performance. Like for testing a data analysis tool, we use different datasets to check the accuracy and efficiency of a tool. This helps us assess how well the tool meets our requirements under different conditions.\nIntegration capabilities are a big deal for us which is why we examine how easy it is to incorporate an AI tool into our existing systems. We test the compatibility with common software platforms to ensure smooth integration while noting any technical issues or complications during the process.\nNext, user experience is another important aspect for our testing. We explore the AI tool's interface by collecting feedback from our team members who\u2019ve already used the tool. This helps us determine if the tool is easy to use and user-friendly.\nConsidering the significance of safety and privacy, we test the AI tool's compliance with industry standards and regulations like GDPR. We ensure it uses encryption and other security measures to protect user data, paying special attention to how it handles sensitive information.\nTo complete our testing, we evaluate the support and community of the AI tool. We reach out to dedicated customer support with questions and note how responsive they are. We also check user forums and online reviews to calculate the level of community involvement, which gives us insights into common issues and solutions.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nSoftware for teams\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy for teams to work together.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork. Co-create in Real-Time with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Start Your Google Workspace Free Trial. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best task management apps.\nThe best online collaboration tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online collaboration tool for comms\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSlack is without doubt a mighty collaboration tool, with millions of users around the globe. It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it. The only thing we could wish for is better support channels.\nRead our full Miro review.\nBest online collaboration tool for tracking\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest online collaboration tool for organizing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have ever looked into project management software and online collaboration tools, then no doubt you\u2019ve come across Trello. Available on the web and with mobile apps, it lets you easily organize projects and work on them with colleagues.\nThe platform allows you to work with boards or lists, which can be organized by teams and different tasks. And within these, you can set up to-do lists and delegate amongst colleagues. There\u2019s also the option to assign comments to cards \u2013 a quick way to give feedback to others.\nFurthermore, Trello boasts a number of integrations with apps such as Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive and Slack. You can download the app for free, but there are premium options available which give access to more features.\nThe Premium pricing tier unlocks a number of additional administrative features for better organization. There's also an Enterprise edition which is priced according to the number of users required, and provides some additional organizational management features.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest online collaboration tool space\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Workspace (formerly called G Suite) is Google's answer to Microsoft 365, and more. This is one of the best platforms you can choose for an organization because it comes with a lot of features.\nThink of this software as the enterprise version of all the popular Google tools you use. For instance, you can create custom business emails for staff that uses the same interface as the popular Gmail app. People can create and edit documents collaboratively on Google Docs; you\u2019ll see any changes in real time, and anyone is free to make comments and suggestions for any changes.\nThere's Meet, a video-conferencing solution for enterprises; this tool for valuable for colleagues to stay in touch with each other, especially for remote companies. There\u2019s also Google Chat, a messaging tool for enterprises; Google Drive for file sharing; Google Sheets for spreadsheets; and a shared calendar tool that enables colleagues to keep tabs on each other\u2019s schedules. These tools are what you\u2019ll get access to as a Google Workspace subscriber.\nA Starter plan includes 30GB storage per user and a maximum of 100 participants in video meetings. The Standard plan includes 2TB of storage and up to 150 participants in video meetings. The Plus plan includes 5TB of storage per user and up to 500 participants in video meetings. There's also an Enterprise plan that offers as much storage and video meeting participants as you need; this plan has no standard pricing, so you'll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nYou can save on your Google Workspace subscription with our Google Workspace promo codes.\nRead our full Google Workspace review.\nBest online collaboration tool for mobile\nReasons to buy\nPodio describes itself as a flexible and customizable online platform for work and communication among teams. In other words, it gives you a way to organize large stacks of work and to delegate tasks between employees.\nJust like many of the other business collaboration apps out there, Podio provides you with the tools to share files, view the status of ongoing projects and get feedback on the things you\u2019re currently working on. These functionalities are combined into an easy-to-use interface.\nPodio is also equipped with quality mobile apps for when you\u2019re out and about, and need to use your smartphone or tablet, and it has an impressive amount of integration with third-party services and apps including Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and Zendesk.\nRead our full Podio review.\nBest online collaboration tool for ease-of-use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRyver is similar to Slack, aiming to give your organization a highly effective means of communication, and an easy way to talk over tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met.\nWhat makes Ryver a compelling option is the fact that you can create as many teams as you want within the app, and easily categorize them to boot. As is the case with Slack, you can use the platform to set up chats with groups and individuals.\nThere are some interesting filters, too. You can control who sees the things you say and post in the app, and obviously enough, join the teams that are most relevant to you. All company posts are located within a Facebook-style newsfeed, and you can mark posts to come back to them later on.\nThere\u2019s also a host of native clients across mobile and desktop, including Mac and Linux. There's also a premium version for enterprise which offers workflow automation, Single Sign-On (SSO), and advanced team management.\nRead our full Ryver review.\nBest online collaboration platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAirtable is a platform that supports extensive online collaboration and project management. You can use it to share data seamlessly within an organization for people to collaborate. This platform has extensive third-party integration, so you can sync data from other apps and ensure it is always up-to-date.\nAirtable is not just a standalone collaborative tool. It is actually a platform on which people can build collaborative apps. It touts itself as \u201clow-code\u201d, meaning you don\u2019t need sophisticated programming skills to build apps on it, although a little will help. Anyone in your organization can build an app on Airtable to foster collaboration.\nYou can start with the free plan, which has limitations on the file sizes and the number of collaborators. Thus, you\u2019ll need a paid plan to maximize your use of this platform, and you can choose from one of three such plans; Plus, Pro, and Enterprise.\nThe Plus plan supports an unlimited number of users. The limitation is that you'll get a maximum of 5GB space per base (which refers to a project) and a maximum of 5,000 records for each base. The Pro plan increases the storage space to 20GB per base with a maximum of 50,000 records for each base. The Enterprise plan is the highest, giving you up to 1TB of space per base and 100,000 records; this plan has no standard pricing, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nRead our full Airtable review.\nBest online collaboration tool for designers\n10. InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards. In this case, the board is virtual, and you are free to write text while discussing with your team about a work project. You can also add images, photos, videos, etc., to provide context for your ideas.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll need templates to explain an idea to your teammates, e.g., flowcharts and interactive widgets. The good thing is that InVision provides over 200 pre-built templates that you can use for this.\nThe Freehand tool also has direct integrations with a lot of third-party software. For example, you can open a video chat by connecting to Zoom or Webex or turn your whiteboard ideas directly into tasks on Jira and Asana. If you wish, you can import your existing whiteboards from other collaborative apps, e.g., Miro.\nThis platform was built mainly for designers but is not exclusive to them. It is also suitable for product teams, human resource (HR) teams, marketing teams, etc.\nOther collaborative software to consider\nThere are many other collaboration tools worth your attention, if nothing else because of the way they apply features differently, or even add other useful features. Here we'll look at some additional online collaboration tools that could be worth exploring further:\nVisme is developed specifically for collaborative online reports, presentations, and infographics. Aside from promoting branding support and aiming to reduce design costs, analytics are provided so you can see which presentations and reports result in the most engagement, and adjust accordingly. Visme recommends itself for sales and marketing, HR and recruiting, internal communications, as well as education and in-house training. The software is specifically priced around individual, business, or education use.\nBasecamp aims to be an all-in-one collaboration and communications platform, to bring features of multiple software offerings into a single place so that it's easier to sort through information, and, of course, keep it all in one easy to manage place. Features include chat, messageboards, to-do lists and scheduling as well as automated check-in, as well as a single place to store all documents, files, and folders. Unlike other collaborative software that charges per user, Basecamp charges a single fee of $99.99 for unlimited users, which could make it especially attractive to larger organizations.\nWrike is more of a project management and scheduling tool, that makes it easy to see where everyone is in terms of completing a project. As a standalone it might seem quite limited compared to some of the others here, but its strength lies in its extensive range of integrations, which includes Google, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft, Adobe, and Github. This means Wrike can work as a central platform tied to a number of others software apps, allowing you to cover a wider range of options and features than some standalone software options.\nMonday.com is a platform that allows you to plan, track, and collaborate on projects in a visually simple manner. Drag-and-drop functionality and ease of use make this a particularly good platform for project management and general workflow management among teams. It also integrates with Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, so you can use it a central focal point for teams to work together. As above, these integrations mean that monday.com can be used to achieve a wider working remit than the standalone platform itself.\nWe've also featured the best small business software.\nBest online collaboration tool FAQs\nTips for choosing a suitable online collaboration tool\n1. Consider your budget and look for something that\u2019s affordable for your enterprise. If you\u2019re a large organization with a sizeable IT budget, you can go with a more expensive platform that\u2019ll give you access to sophisticated features that you may not even need much. In contrast, if you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s wise to choose a plan that gives you just the basic collaboration features at a reasonable price.\n2. Customer support. Things can go wrong at any time, so choose a platform that offers customer support via email, live chat, or telephone. Check user reviews to see what other people are saying about your intended platform\u2019s support before making a final choice.\n3. Look for a platform with a user-friendly interface. This will make it easy for employees of your organization to collaborate instead of losing productivity trying to figure out how to use the software.\n4. Choose a platform with a strong security reputation to avoid leaks or theft of sensitive data.\n5. Pick a platform that has integrations with third-party tools for additional functionalities that you may need.\nWhich online collaboration tools is best for you?\nWhen deciding which online collaboration tool to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to work with a handful of people on a casual basis may find a cheaper option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use online collaboration tools for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced options that are included.\nHow we tested the best online collaboration tools\nTo test for the best online collaboration tools we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use online collaboration tools regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Encouraging AI uptake: people first, tech second\nIf value and purpose aren\u2019t defined then AI adoption will likely fail\nThe recent announcement that Google is embedding a new AI mode into its search engine is yet another example of our daily exposure to AI. In theory, almost everything could be automated if we really wanted it to be, but getting the most out of AI tools within a workplace setting will always come down to thinking strategically.\nWhat is the value it will create and how will it impact people? That\u2019s not just employees or users, but partners and ultimately customers. If the value and purpose aren\u2019t defined \u2013 and the roadmap to achieve success is unclear \u2013 then AI adoption is likely to fail.\nHead of Digitalisation, Marketing and Entrepreneurship at Henley Business School.\nFrom appetite to adoption\nIn a recent survey we carried out with over 4,000 UK workers, we found that the appetite to use AI within the workplace is there, with more than half of respondents (56%) feeling optimistic about the benefits. But when it comes to getting the most out of it, workers were less positive. 61% admitted to being overwhelmed by the rapid pace of AI advancements and that the sheer number of tools available make it difficult to know where to start (24%).\nSo how can the gap be bridged to ensure AI enhances workers\u2019 lives and is used strategically? Although the pace of AI advancement is rapid, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to throw best practice out of the window and adopt it without due diligence or thorough assessment. Knowing what to automate, and equally what not to automate, is about assessing the risk, setting objectives and putting measurable performance indicators in place. Only by having a clear goal for AI can businesses bring stakeholders along on the journey and achieve real value.\nReducing risk\nAdopting AI brings different levels of risk \u2013 from operational to reputational. Without clear guidance for usage or contingency for failure, day-to-day business operations can be negatively impacted. Reputational risk and preservation of value must also be considered when looking to automate certain processes. For example, what experience do you want people to have when interacting with your business? What value do you want to create? What risks are you going to take, if something goes wrong, and how resilient is your business against these risks?\nAnd what would you lose as a result of automation? It\u2019s harder to define what shouldn\u2019t be automated but it\u2019s just as important as knowing what should. It requires reflection on what a business does and what it values. AI shouldn\u2019t be about humans being replaced by machines but about how AI technology can be used effectively, to augment processes and support people to do their best work.\nTied in with assessing risk is ensuring responsible usage of AI. The OECD AI principles promote the use of AI that is innovative and trustworthy and respects human rights and democratic values, with an emphasis on human-centered values. By following these principles, organizations can not only adopt AI responsibly but have a basis on which to create clear guidelines for employee usage and expectations.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nTransparency and trust\nSetting a clear strategy and defining the right role for AI is not enough. The right culture needs to be created and any plans communicated effectively to those it will impact, to allay any anxiety around usage. AI comes with many connotations and preconceptions, so it\u2019s important for organizations to remove fear of the unknown.\nThis can be done by creating a safe environment for people to explore what AI can do, with the support of clear guidelines on what tools are available to them. This will give users the confidence to use AI in their roles and remove any misalignment between perception and reality.\nDedicated AI training and guidance are crucial for the success of any initiatives. This is backed up by our survey in which a quarter (24%) of UK workers cited that a lack of training makes it hard to use AI effectively at work. Almost a half (49%) said their employer has no guidelines at all for using AI. When asked how inclined they would be to use or use AI more in the workplace if provided with training, the majority (60%) said they would be more inclined.\nThis suggests that many workplaces still lack positive facilitating conditions for AI usage, which could be leading workers to feel overwhelmed and under-supported when it comes to using AI tools within their role. Creating a culture of openness around AI usage will help build transparency and trust for users and ensure they can get value from it. Providing an environment for sharing experiences \u2013 positive and negative \u2013 will further support adoption. As not every organization has an \u2018AI expert\u2019, sharing these experiences will support best-practice creation and adoption across the organization.\nLeading from the top down\nLike with any new technology adoption, there will be short and long term value. ROI will not always be immediate. As such it\u2019s important to effectively manage change and expectations. Any type of business transformation will create different ways of working and a period of adjustment, which can take time for users to adapt to.\nIt is therefore important that AI adoption initiatives are driven from the top, with senior managers providing clarity for users. Leaders need to make sure people understand the strategy behind the introduction of AI, the ultimate goal, and how AI supports it. This will help reduce uncertainties and fear of the unknown, and ensure both the business and users achieve value. Only through creating a culture of transparency, trust and continuous learning can AI augment workers\u2019 lives rather than overwhelm.\nWe've featured the best productivity tool.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.
