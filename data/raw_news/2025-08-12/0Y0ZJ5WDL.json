  "title": "Laptop Taking Up Too Much Space? Close It and Use a Monitor",
  "description": "Closing your laptop doesn't mean you have to stop using it. Just hook it up to an external monitor.",
  "content": "Laptops have made it easy to keep working when you're on the go, but that doesn't mean they're perfect for every situation. Whether you need more space at your desk or you need a larger monitor to keep track of things at work, hooking up an external monitor can let you stay productive. And you don't need to keep your laptop open, either.\n\nIf you want to keep your laptop closed and use only the monitor, you can turn your laptop into a compact desktop setup with a few quick settings tweaks.\n\nYou'll need the basics: a monitor, keyboard and mouse. You'll also need the right cable to connect your laptop's display output to your monitor. If your laptop doesn't have enough ports, consider getting a USB hub or dock. To help create the perfect desk setup, we've put together this guide.\n\nHow to close a Windows laptop and use the monitor\n\nWindows laptops have some settings that you will need to change if you want to use them with the lid closed. Follow these steps to close the lid of your Windows laptop and use the monitor.\n\n1. Open the Control Panel by looking for it in Windows search. Navigate to Hardware and Sound > Power Options and click Choose what closing the lid does in the left pane. You can also look up this option directly in Windows search to open the settings directly.\n\n2. Click the dropdowns next to When I close the lid, under On battery and Plugged in. Select Do nothing for both.\n\n3. Click Save changes to apply your new lid settings.\n\n4. Connect your external keyboard and mouse to the right ports on your laptop or a connected USB hub or dock. Depending on your hardware, you can also connect a wireless keyboard and mouse by plugging in the USB dongle or setting them up in Bluetooth settings.\n\n5. Connect your external monitor to the correct display output port on your laptop or a connected USB hub or dock.\n\n6. Close the lid and use the monitor with your keyboard and mouse.\n\n7. If your monitor's resolution, refresh rate, or display scaling appears off after closing the lid, navigate to Settings > System > Display to adjust them. Some settings may be under Advanced display.\n\nHow to close a MacBook and use the monitor\n\nThe display behavior on MacOS is a bit different to Windows. You don't have to change your lid settings. However, you do have to plug in your MacBook, or it will likely enter sleep mode when you close the lid.\n\n1. Plug the power adapter into your MacBook.\n\n2. Connect your external keyboard and mouse to the right ports on your MacBook or a connected USB hub or dock. If you have a wireless keyboard and mouse, connect the USB dongle or set up the devices via Bluetooth settings.\n\n3. Connect your external monitor to the HDMI or USB-C Thunderbolt port (or another available display output port) on your MacBook or connected USB hub or dock.\n\n4. When your MacBook's desktop shows up on the external monitor, close the lid.\n\n5. If your monitor doesn't show the macOS desktop, wake your Mac by pressing a key on the keyboard and moving the mouse.\n\n6. Apple also suggests configuring display settings. Click the Apple menu in the top-right corner of the screen, choose System Settings (or System Preferences) and click Displays. You can adjust the display resolution, refresh rate, and more here.\n\nUsing a laptop at your desk with the lid closed\n\nAlthough using a laptop with the lid closed is a good way to get the most out of it, there are a few things to keep in mind. If you regularly use your laptop or MacBook with the lid closed, it's a good idea to get a USB hub or dock so you don't have to plug in every peripheral every time you connect your laptop.\n\nAdditionally, using a laptop with the lid closed may cause it to heat up more. Keep an eye on the temperatures and make sure your laptop is seated properly with enough room for proper air circulation. Some laptops may be better off with the lid open if your usage is prolonged.\n\nIf you want to get the best out of your desk setup, you might want to take a look at our list of the best home office essentials. If you'd like to get a better desk, we also have a roundup of the best desks you can get, as well as the top-standing desks on the market.",

      "text": "USB-C took the connection to devices and computers and made it simple so you can connect a monitor, keyboard, mouse, Ethernet, microSD and SD cards, external storage and more with ease. If your computer doesn't have enough ports for all your devices, you're not alone. However, you can still connect all of those things at once with a USB-C hub or dock with multiple ports. There are a lot of options, and this is a list of the best USB-C hubs that we've tested.\nOur Picks\nWhat's the best USB-C hub overall?\nThe best USB-C hub overall is the EZQuest USB-C Multimedia eight-port Hub. There are less expensive options, but the EZQuest combines an excellent assortment of ports, durability for travel and reliability over several months of testing. It even has labels on the top to get your devices connected faster with less fumbling. EZQuest makes several other USB-C hubs including a 13-in-one model also on this list.\nNarrowing down your options and finding the best USB-C hub comes down to knowing how portable you need it to be, exactly which connections you need and your desired data transfer speed. Here are some of our favorite USB-C docking stations that we've tested. We'll continue to update this list as we find new USB hubs and docks to recommend. And if you're looking to charge your USB-C devices, here are the best options per our testing.\nRead more: Best USB-C PD Chargers of 2023\nBest USB-C hubs of 2025\nThis USB-C hub has all the essentials most would need for office or home use at a reasonable price, especially if your laptop is limited to only USB-C ports. There are three USB-A ports, including one with power delivery, microSD and SD card slots, and an HDMI out that supports resolutions up to 4K at 30Hz. At the end is a Gigabit Ethernet connection with an activity LED (something other hubs this size typically leave off). But what sets it apart from others at this size are the handy labels printed on top of the anodized aluminum case.\nThere is a 100-watt USB-C pass-through for power delivery, with 15 watts used to power the hub. The hub is lightweight, which makes it great for travel but also means any cords you plug into it could cause it to slide around your desk -- a common issue with hubs this size. But if you're looking for a single hub to cover everything from an external display and wired web access to charging your phone, this has you covered.\nWe've used many Monoprice devices over the years, and they've regularly delivered more for the money. This slim six-in-one travel dock is no different, giving you just enough to hook up your laptop to peripherals and a monitor up to 4K at 60Hz. Also, should you need an Ethernet port, there is a seven-in-one model for $7 more.\nAccell's slim, low-profile Thunderbolt 4 Docking Station is one of the most compact we've tested without sacrificing performance or ports. There are two Intel-certified Thunderbolt 4 ports on the rear as well as a DisplayPort 1.4 connector that, combined, can drive dual UHD 4K monitors at 60Hz or a single 8K display at 30Hz. Another Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port on the front connects to your PC or Mac. The port is shifted all the way to the right so that the cable doesn't block other ports and makes it easier to keep the cable out of the way.\nThree USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A ports, a USB 2.0 Type-A port, an SD 4.0 UHS-II card reader, a 3.5mm audio combo jack and Gigabit Ethernet port round out the connection options. And even with the dock fully loaded, it remained relatively cool compared with others we've tested.\nAlthough there are hubs with more connections that plug directly into a MacBook's USB-C ports, this Plugable hub stands alone with its notch for Apple's MagSafe power connector. Ports include two USB-A 3.0 ports, a combo headphone/mic jack, Ethernet (in the back so it's out of the way) and a USB-C port. And unlike other small hubs like this, the USB-C port can do what the MacBook's can: data transfer up to 40Gbps, display output up to a 6K resolution at 60Hz and power throughput up to 100 watts.\nMost people, including me, use hub and dock interchangeably but they are different devices. A hub adds more ports to a computer to attach more devices. The Element Hub, for instance, turns one Thunderbolt 4 port on your laptop into three Thunderbolt 4 ports so you can attach extra displays, high-speed storage and peripherals. It also gives you four USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports with data speeds up to 10Gbps to add USB-A devices. And the hub can be daisy-chained to another Thunderbolt 4 dock or hub for even more connections.\nThe included power adapter (it's actually larger than the hub itself) can deliver up to 60 watts of charging power to attached devices. That's not enough for more power-hungry laptops but fine for a Chromebook and smaller laptops like a Dell XPS 13 or Apple MacBook Air. You can also disconnect it from your computer and just use it to power up your phone, tablet and other devices.\nOne other nice touch: CalDigit made the design reversible so you can flip it on your desk to have whichever ports you'd like facing forward.\nUgreen's tiny tower of ports uses a DisplayLink chipset to drive three displays at up to 4K at 60Hz via its DisplayPort and dual HDMI outputs with Windows or MacOS systems. Windows users can opt to run one display at up to 8K at 30Hz plus two at 4K at 60Hz.\nDisplayLink software is required to drive the displays properly. There's also no power supply included, just a USB-C cable. If you're using it with a laptop with a USB-C power adapter, you can use it to power the dock. It supports up to 100-watt power delivery letting you charge your laptop as well as power the dock.\nIt handles more than displays, too, with one 10Gbps and two 5Gbps USB-A ports, a 10Gbps USB-C port, a combo headset jack, Gigabit Ethernet and SD and microSD card slots. The minimal footprint helps keep your desk tidy, and it's light enough to travel with if you needed to (but there are better options for that on this list).\nThe PowerExpand Elite is part USB-C dock and part charging station. In back are 85- and 15-watt Thunderbolt 3 ports, and in front is an 18-watt USB-C power delivery port. A Thunderbolt 3 port supports up to a 5K-resolution display at 60Hz while its HDMI 2.0 port can support a display up to 4K resolution at 60Hz. Or you can run a USB-C-to-HDMI dual splitter and connect two 4K displays at 30Hz so you can run up to three monitors between the HDMI port and Thunderbolt 3 ports.\nYou'll also have four USB-A ports, a Gigabit Ethernet jack and MicroSD and SD card reader. A 3.5mm combo jack handles audio output and input.\nTo provide enough juice to run everything, though, the PowerExpand Elite has a large 180-watt power adapter. Also, the fanless design means the body is one big heat sink so it can get hot when it's fully loaded. You can stand it vertically to help keep it cooler.\nMost small USB-C hubs have short attached cables. That's fine if your laptop is on a desk and not on a laptop stand and that desk has plenty of space directly next to your laptop's USB-C port. For those who could use some extra cable reach, though, the Lention C37 is ideal.\nThe USB device is still compact and lightweight but has a 1-meter cable (3.3 feet). It has dual USB-C ports with 60-watt power delivery, two USB-A ports, microSD and SD card slots and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the end is an HDMI output that supports 4K at 30Hz or lower resolutions at 60Hz. This is also a great option for desktops that are kept on the floor.\nThe Ultimate Plus shows off just what's possible with a single USB-C port. Along with four USB 3.0 type-A ports, there are microSD and SD card slots, a 3.5mm combo headset jack and a Gigabit Ethernet jack. But the biggest reason to choose this model is its support for three displays.\nThere are two full-size HDMI outputs joined by an old-school VGA output. The VGA can only handle outputting at 1080p, but one HDMI can output at resolutions up to 4K at 60Hz while the other can output up to 4K at 30Hz. That's a lot for one compact desktop dock and a single connection to your laptop or desktop.\nIn our tests, it lived up to its promise of handling all of its connections at once. The ports might not offer the fastest speeds of other docks (the USB-A ports top out at 5Gbps for example), but if three monitors and a lot of extra connections on your desk are what matters, this is the dock for you.\nThis add-on dock slides right over the foot of a 24-inch iMac. It includes USB-A and USB-C ports, plus slots for both microSD and SD cards and even an internal slot for an M.2 storage drive. The 11-inch wide dock also has the exact footprint as the iMac's color-matched keyboard, so it can sit on top of the dock/foot combo when not being used. At $150, it's a little on the pricey side, and there are no HDMI or DisplayPort outputs. But if you're looking for a tidy solution to add some extra ports to an iMac, this is a sweet solution."

      "text": "A wireless mouse can be as good as a wired if you get a high quality one. They're available with many options desired in a mouse like buttons, ergonomic design and other features that can even save you time when working. No matter what you're looking for in your wireless mouse, there's likely to be a quality choice for those features.\nOur Picks\nWith so many options, finding the right mouse can be overwhelming. That's why we've pulled together a list of our favorite tested and approved wireless mice for you to choose from.\nSince all mice are not equal, our wireless mouse testing considers features, size and weight, comfort, battery type, battery life and software. If you aren't quite sure what might work best for you, jump past our recommendations to our wireless mouse FAQ at the bottom of this story.\nWhat's the best wireless mouse?\nWe've tested a lot of wireless mice, and based on our testing, the best wireless mouse is the Logitech MX Master 3S. It's expensive (at $100), but if you're looking for a flexible office mouse to boost your productivity with a Mac or Windows PC, this do-it-all wireless mouse has you covered. It's durable, so it will last for years to come. If you need a more travel-friendly option, we recommend its linemate, the Logitech MX Anywhere 3.\nIf those mice don't meet your needs or budget, we have other wireless mouse options in the list below starting at less than $10.\nBest wireless mice for 2025\nThe MX Master 3S combines the customization of a gaming mouse with an ergonomic design made for getting work done. Logitech's software makes it easy to set the five programmable buttons and thumb scroll wheel of the MX Master to handle a variety of tasks, from taking screenshots to controlling media.\nCompared to the older MX Master 3, the updated model features quieter operation and an upgraded 8,000 DPI optical sensor (up from 4,000 DPI) that tracks on most surfaces, including glass, and offers faster workflow with high-resolution monitors. It can be used with a cord or wireless via Bluetooth or the included Unifying USB adapter, and it supports connections to up to three computers; the button on the bottom lets you quickly switch between connections. The mouse also supports the Logitech Flow feature, letting you move your cursor between computers on the same network. This mouse provides superb battery life for long work sessions.\nDespite its smaller size, the MX Anywhere 3 mouse is essentially a smaller version of the MX Master 3 also on this list. These Logitech mice share many features, including dual-wireless connectivity (they can be used wired, too), hyperfast scroll capabilities, programmable buttons and Logitech Flow for moving your cursor between two computers on the same network. The battery will last for up to 70 days on a full charge, and a quick three-minute charge of the battery can get you through a workday. It's also comfortable to use the buttons despite its small size and, perhaps most importantly, it can be used on just about any surface, including glass -- so don't worry about a mouse pad.\nThe MX Anywhere 3 comes in a couple of versions. There's the standard \"universal\" version that works with Windows, MacOS, iPadOS (13.4 or higher), ChromeOS and Linux computers via Bluetooth or Logitech's Unifying USB dongle, which is included. MX Anywhere 3 for Mac works only via Bluetooth and is optimized for Macs and iPads. Shipping soon, both mice are available in pale gray and the MX Anywhere 3 (with the USB port dongle) is also offered in rose and graphite.\nLike a lot of ergonomic office products, companies that make ergonomic mice aim for the largest group of potential vertical mouse users. By doing that, they're inevitably leaving out people whose hands are too small or too large for the mouse, they're only made for right-handed users or both. The Unimouse is the rare option that'll really work for just about anyone.\nThe wireless mouse is available for left and right hands (it's available in a wired version, too) and has a crazy amount of adjustability to create a custom fit for your hand. The top part of the body starts at a 35-degree angle, but its friction hinge lets you lift it up to a 75-degree angle -- or anywhere in between -- that puts it into more of a handshake position. Its ball-mounted thumb support cradles your thumb and can be rotated and tilted to whatever position is most comfortable for you. Also, it's on a telescoping post so you can use a wider or narrower grip. The post can also be moved forward and backward.\nA 2.4GHz USB adapter is used for its wireless connection, there is no Bluetooth and it can be used wired while you charge it with the included micro-USB cable. There are six programmable buttons: left, middle, right, scroll click, forward and back. I appreciated having the additional button on top (once my muscle memory adjusted to it), but the forward and back button placement was just a little too far back on the body for me to use comfortably. The included app is basic but gets the job done letting you reprogram buttons and adjust cursor scroll speeds. DPI can be set from 800 to 2800 in increments of 200 with the software or a button on the mouse. You can also set up application-specific profiles with the app.\nIf you're ready to give an ergonomic mouse a try, the Unimouse's customizable design is tough to beat.\nTrackballs seem to get overlooked but, going by the comments on this story, that's a big mistake. Logitech options like the Logitech MX Ergo and the Kensington Orbit offer more comfort but the same control you'd get with a regular mouse. Plus, since it stays stationary, you don't need extra desk space for movement and it can be used on any surface.\nLogitech's latest Ergo Trackball won us over with its new sculpted shape that fits a wider variety of hand sizes and a lower price than the MX Ergo. That said, the MX Ergo has a sturdier, more solid feel and can be paired to two devices simultaneously. The M575 does give you a choice of Bluetooth or the company's USB-A wireless receiver.\nLunar Artefacts designed this wireless mouse to essentially be the last mouse you'll ever need. The body of the mouse is made from hand-polished brass or aluminum (I tested the latter), offering you two weight options. The removable cover is cut from full-grain calf leather finished with equestrian-inspired stitching. Both are designed to wear or patina over time and get more attractive, as opposed to the average plastic mouse which eventually just gets gross.\nThe sculpted ambidextrous base is not your typical mouse shape so it might take a few days or more to adjust and get comfortable. If you don't want to wait, the company makes special grips to give it more of a traditional shape. The smooth metal scroll wheel was the only issue I had with the design because it didn't have the grip of a knurled wheel. It's a quibble given how excellent the rest of the mouse is.\nThe mouse's Pixart PAW 3805 optical sensor works on almost any surface including glass or mirrors and a button on the bottom lets you choose the pointer sensitivity setting: 800, 1,200, 2,000 or 3,000 DPI. It can connect wirelessly over Bluetooth 5.0 or 2.4GHz wireless with the USB-A adapter that is stored in the base when not in use. It can also be used wired with the braided USB-C-to-USB-A cable included, which also charges the mouse. The mouse has Qi wireless charging, so it's easy enough to keep the battery topped off.\nThis mouse is high-quality through and through, but will it all last forever? Lunar Artefacts made the mouse completely user-repairable. Pop the cover off and remove a handful of screws and it can be completely disassembled right down to the plug-and-play Omron switches. This mouse (pointer instrument) may be with you for a long, long time.\nMice that live up to the quality of Microsoft's other Surface hardware are worth their price, especially if you work on multiple Windows PCs simultaneously. Using Microsoft's Mouse and Keyboard Center software, you can not only program its customizable buttons but connect the device to three different computers and seamlessly move your cursor between them, similar to Logitech's Flow feature. It's a great synthesis between keyboard and mouse. The Surface Precision Mouse can be used wired as well with its USB charging cable and is quite honestly one of the most comfortable mice we've ever used.\nOnce you dip below $15 you usually lose features like forward and back buttons (or comfort). Wisfox's mouse has a comfortable curve for a more ergonomic fit and rubberized sides to give you extra grip. A button on top lets you switch between three DPI settings to help you get around your monitor with less wrist movement.\nThe battery compartment (the mouse uses one AA battery, not included) houses the wireless nano USB receiver when not in use, so you're less likely to lose it. It also comes in 14 colors. It doesn't have Bluetooth, but Wisfox does make one with both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth, as well as one with a USB-C adapter for newer laptops.\nYes, it's another Logitech mouse, but good wireless mice that are easy on the wallet and comfortable for work and high-performance wireless gaming aren't easy to find. The G305 device's lightweight, ambidextrous design hits the mark as a gaming mouse, and its single AA battery will last for up to 250 hours of continuous PC gaming -- that's a lot of battery life. It does not have Bluetooth but instead uses Logitech's wireless Lightspeed USB adapter. The tiny adapter is stored under the mouse's palm rest for travel when removed from the USB port. It also has a Hero optical sensor for optimal gaming performance.\nFrequently asked questions\nFor many people, the biggest difference between a Bluetooth mouse and a 2.4GHz wireless mouse is the latter connects wirelessly to a small USB adapter you plug into your computer, while Bluetooth connects wirelessly directly to your device or computer. This is really Bluetooth's biggest advantage since it means you don't have to plug anything into your computer and there's no adapter to lose.\nIf you have an open USB port on your computer, going with a 2.4GHz wireless has a lot of advantages. The connection is seamless with no pairing needed out of the box -- just plug in the adapter and turn on the mouse and you're working. The connection is less prone to interference and is generally lag-free, which can't be said for Bluetooth and is why gaming mice don't use Bluetooth.\nTo save on battery life, Bluetooth mice typically go to sleep and need to wake and reconnect, which takes a second or two, whereas a wireless mouse stays connected. Wireless mice generally have longer battery life, too, but newer mice using Bluetooth LE last much longer so that mainly comes down to the individual mouse now.\nIf you're really not sure which to get, look for a wireless mouse that gives you the option to use either Bluetooth or a 2.4GHz wireless adapter. These dual-wireless mice are great for multidevice users since they can connect to one or two devices via Bluetooth and a third with their wireless adapter. A button on the mouse lets you jump from device to device.\nWhat type of battery you should have in your mouse is largely a matter of preference but each has its pros and cons. Mice with built-in rechargeable batteries tend to have longer battery life and are lighter weight than those that use standard AA- or AAA-size batteries. Since the battery is rechargeable, you don't have to keep extra batteries around, which is especially nice for travel. This also means you're regularly creating less waste assuming you only use disposable batteries. Rechargeable mice can usually be used wired while you're charging them.\nWith wireless mice that use replaceable batteries, you have the option to use either regular alkaline or lithium batteries or rechargeable batteries. That means you never have to wait to recharge and you can cut down on waste, but it is also an extra ongoing expense (albeit not a huge one). Another advantage is that battery life will degrade over time with a rechargeable mouse and eventually, you'll have to replace the entire mouse. With replaceable batteries, it's only the mouse mechanics that you have to worry about wearing out.\nA wireless mouse gives you greater freedom of movement, less cable clutter on your desk and one less thing to plug into your computer (and with fewer ports on computers today, this is no small thing). When it comes to travel, there is nothing more convenient than a wireless mouse you can just drop in your bag. Plus, if you use a 2.4GHz wireless mouse, today's adapters are so small you can leave them plugged into your laptop while you're on the go. If you have a Bluetooth mouse, you don't have to worry about the adapter.\nA wired mouse, on the other hand, is generally lighter weight than a wireless mouse. It's plug-and-play, so once it's connected you're ready to work. The wired connection also means you don't have to deal with wireless interference, pairing or losing your connection. (All good reasons to go with a wired mouse for gaming, by the way.) You also never have to think about charging or replacing a battery.\nStill not sure which is best for you? Consider getting a rechargeable wireless mouse that can be used with a wired connection to your computer. That way it stays charged for when you need to use it wirelessly but without sacrificing the performance of a wired connection."

      "text": "Remote work is quickly becoming the norm for many of us, with work-from-home jobs becoming more common. You can't work from a coffee shop every day, so having a home office is ideal. Whether you have a hybrid schedule that lets you work a few days of the week from home or a full remote gig, you need the right work-from-home setup that lets you attend video calls and tackle spreadsheets with ease. We've put together this list of our favorite work-from-home equipment, including desk stands, USB mics, wireless headphones, webcams and other devices that will help you work from home without any hassles. These are our home office essentials for a reliable work-from-home setup.\nOur Picks\nWhat's the best home office essential?\nIf you are working from home but as part of a team a really good webcam is essential. We like the Dell Pro 2K webcam for its face tracking and high-quality visuals. it also comes with a magnetic cap to cover it when not in use, just in case you are security conscious.\nThe home office must-haves for a remote worker are obvious: a full-size keyboard, a wireless mouse and an external monitor. A handful of other gear -- from the best desk, blue-light-blocking glasses or a good pair of noise-canceling headphones -- can make your workday less frustrating, more productive and comfortable. Our recommendations for the best home office essentials for your home office setup are below. We'll update this list periodically as we review new products.\nWhen you're presenting a meeting or actively participating in one, you need to be front and center on the screen. The Dell Pro webcam uses some clever software to keep you centered in the frame as you move around a whiteboard or wheel around your office.\nThe image is crisp and looks cleaner than almost any other webcam I've used. I'll admit it works much better on a Mac than on a PC, but on a PC, it's the very best webcam you can use right now.\nPros:\n- Sharp image\n- Face tracking\n- Security cover\nCons:\n- A little pricey\nThis Logitech mouse is ostensibly geared for travel, but it's really just a good all-around mouse for anyone who finds the step-up Logitech MX Master 3 to be overkill. From the scroll wheel to the programmable side buttons, this mouse can handle any pointing task. It charges via USB-C and interfaces with devices via the included USB-A unifying dongle or Bluetooth. There's also an Apple-centric model available for the same price.\nPros:\n- Excellent scroll wheel\n- Compact\n- Extra side buttons\nCons:\n- Less ergonomic than its big brother\nIt's not my favorite webcam, but the C920S will get the job done. The image quality and sound pickup are pretty good, and the clip-on design makes it suitable for an external monitor or laptop computer. The physical privacy shutter is a confidence-inspiring flourish that protects you and your office space from prying eyes.\nPros:\n- Great price\n- Good picture for 1080p\n- Security cap\nCons:\n- Still only 1080p\nThe Shure MV5 digital condenser microphone combines an unfussy setup and high-quality audio with a compact design. I wouldn't recommend it for high-stakes recording projects, but it will certainly boost the sound quality of your Zoom meetings and other web conferencing interactions. It comes with both USB-C and Lightning cables.\nIf you can find it in stock, the Blue Yeti is an even better mic for advanced users, which often comes in around the same price. It features three capsule microphones, four pickup patterns (for different kinds of recording) and just enough controls to help optimize the way you sound without overloading you with super technical features.\nPros:\n- Small yet powerful\n- Great for Zoom\nCons:\n- Not great for recording\nMoft's sit/stand desk converter is stable, easy to use, and easy to store. If you are thinking about a standing desk, but aren't quite ready to take the plunge, this cheaper alternative will give you a taste of the standing desk life. The best thing? If you are working in a hybrid environment you can take your Moft sit/stand desk with you in your backpack, which isn't something you can say about most desks.\nPros:\n- Lightweight\n- Easy to take with you\n- Very sturdy\nCons:\n- Not a permanent structure\nApple's Magic Keyboard is awesome. It has the old-school Mac keyboard design and space, with a pleasing scissor key mechanism and it's wireless, connecting via Bluetooth. Best of all, the battery -- which is rechargeable via USB -- lasts for months on a charge. The larger version with the numeric keypad is also an excellent option.\nPros:\n- Wonderful clacky experience\n- Matches your MacBook perfectly\n- The full-size keyboard is even better\nCons:\n- Expensive for a keyboard\nPros\n- The Logitech K380 is a compact, solidly built wireless Bluetooth keyboard that pairs with up to three devices at once and lets you toggles between them. It's compatible with most Bluetooth-enabled computers, tablets, and smartphones and offers long battery life at up to 2 years from two AAA batteries.\nCons\n- Keys may be a little cramped for users with very large hands; Caps Lock is a little close to the \"a\" key and can be accidentally pressed.\nYou can use Apple's peripherals with Windows machines, but if you're looking for an alternative Bluetooth keyboard that will work with anything from Windows PCs to Macs to iPads to phones, the Logitech K380 is a great choice and runs about $30. Pair it with up to three devices and toggle between each of them with the click of a button.\nPros:\n- Compact\n- Cheap\n- Multi pairing mode\nCons:\n- A little plastic-y feeling\nThe Sennheiser CX buds sound excellent for their price point but do stick out of your ears a little more than some buds. (Note that the new Sennheiser CX Plus is also an option, which adds noise canceling for $30 more and sounds very similar).\nThe buds are equipped with Bluetooth 5.2 and battery life is up to nine hours at moderate volume levels (the slightly bulky charging case stores an additional three charges) versus seven hours for the previous model. The CX also adds an extra microphone on each bud, which improves the voice-calling experience from the earlier CX400 and makes it easier for callers to hear you speak, even in noisy environments. To be clear, these are not active noise-canceling earbuds; they offer noise reduction for calls. Splash-proof, they have an IPX4 rating. Read our Sennheiser CX first take.\nPros\n- The Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System brews lots of tasty drip fast. It brews in multiple sizes. It has a milk frother for latte-style drinks. It uses a separate filter for tea. It's compact and attractive.\nCons\n- It brews a little hot and a touch bitter. Its cold brew mode lacks flavor and strength. There's no manual setting for custom brews.\nWhen you work from home, making coffee can become a daily ritual. Think of this kitchen appliance as the Swiss army knife of the drip coffee maker world. The Ninja programmable brewer (with frother, thermal carafe and reusable filter) offers an uncanny degree of flexibility, making it the best coffee maker for those who don't always want the same cup. It can create everything from solid drip to perfect cold brew, iced coffee to latte-style drinks with its milk frother and it will adjust the temperature according to your choice. Its thermal carafe will keep tea or coffee hot for up to two hours.\nThis programmable coffee maker even lets you brew iced coffee and hot coffee in multiple sizes, from small cups, mugs and travel mugs up to half and full carafes.\nPros:\n- Many ways to make coffee\n- Great milk frother\nCons:\n- Pricey if it isn't your main coffee machine\nWhen you're not commuting, there may be some more time for dinner prep. Dinnerly rolls out exciting-sounding and delicious meals, such as summery chicken panzanella and risotto with asparagus and cannellini beans. With no more than six ingredients per recipe, the impact on your time and kitchen is minimal. The price tag for Dinnerly puts it squarely in the budget-friendly category, clocking in with a cost per serving of around $5. The subscription options include a Two-Person Box for $30, or a Four-Person Box for $48, each with three recipes for the week. Looking for more options? Check out our list of best meal kit services.\nPros:\n- Delicious\n- Easy to cook\nCons:\n- Meals can become expensive\nAfter testing the Expression I was pleasantly surprised at how well this printer did. Being Epson's budget option it could have been poor, but instead performed excellently at text reproduction and about average on the image quality.\nThe setup was quick and easy and the Wi-Fi connection seems to be solid wherever I put it in my house. Print time was average at 1 minute, 15 seconds, but the text quality more than made up for the speed. All of the text, even the photocopied text, was legible and smooth.\nThe only downside is how small the ink cartridges are on this printer. I know ink is where companies make the most money, but replacing these tiny cartridges every few weeks or months will get old quickly.\nPros:\n- Budget-friendly all-in-one\n- Great text fidelity\n- Small footprint\nCons:\n- The starter ink is tiny\nPros\n- - Lightweight and premium feeling materials\n- - Quick and easy assembly\n- - Can be assembled solo if needed\n- - Memory of four heights\n- - Cable tidy\n- - Color options\nCons\n- - Generic look\n- - Very business feeling\nAt first glance, the Branch standing desk looks pretty generic, but the level of craftsmanship is apparent on closer inspection. All of the materials feel premium, with a weight that only comes from good engineering.\nPutting it together was simple and only took about 30 minutes, although having two people would reduce that significantly. It was also well packaged -- something that Branch does with all its products -- so it was in top shape once I had it all together.\nThe Branch desk can remember four separate heights and has a handy cable door at the back to keep your desk clear and tidy. Depending on your color choice, the desk can feel a little too business-like. If you choose one of the warmer woods and the gray legs, it will likely fit into your home office better.\nIf you're furnishing an office, the Branch desk and Verve office chair from our best office chairs are a great combination.\nPros:\n- Incredibly well constructed\n- Four programmable heights\nCons:\n- Somewhat clinical\nHow we test home office essentials\nBecause home office essentials are a healthy amalgam of tech and other services, our testing will depend on the product. Each of our products has its own testing schedule and more explanations of how we test products can be found on the best list article for that product. Suffice it to say, in our decades of testing products we've learned a thing or two about every category that will touch your home office experience."

      "text": "Monitor preferences can vary, regardless of how objective your testing is. For instance, I prioritize color accuracy and connection locations over sleek curves; you may feel the opposite. And while expensive monitors aren't necessarily better than cheaper ones, you usually have to spend more or make compromises, especially for specialized displays used for color work or gaming. Throw in the long sales life of monitors -- you'll find years-old monitors for sale, sometimes for great prices but sometimes not -- and even I scratch my head sometimes about whether a new model is worth it, how to winnow down the selection, and even how to figure out which model I'm looking at on retail sites. I hope this helps.\nOur Picks\nWhich is the best monitor overall?\nI've been testing imaging and graphics products for decades, and when it comes to monitors my favorite overall at the moment are OLEDs and QD-OLEDs, because they're so flexible. My top pick is the LG Ultragear 32GS95UE, a 32-inch, 4K OLED with many of the capabilities I expect for both gaming and creating. There's dual refresh rate support (240Hz at 4K and 480Hz in 1080p), granular control over the settings, a lot of color tools for creators and excellent built-in speakers for your general-purpose needs. It's pretty expensive but not outrageous for a high-end monitor.\nA bigger screen but for a lot less is Innocn's 40-inch 40C1R at $450. It's not great but it's good enough all around -- especially if you can find it when the price dips. If you need advice on whether a particular type of monitor is right for you, there are some answers to common questions at the bottom of the list and a lot more guidance available in our general monitor and gaming monitor buying guides. You can also find some related buying advice for finding the best laptop (for Windows users or MacBook seekers), best gaming laptop or using an iPad as an external display\nRead more:\nPros\n- Excellent display quality for gaming, including 4K/240Hz and 1080p/480Hz modes\n- Great speakers\n- Free LG Calibration Studio software (to create/update built-in profiles)\n- A ton of settings\nCons\n- Controller utility doesn't have many of the settings that are in the OSD\n- No DisplayPort 2.1, which you'd expect for the money\n- So many settings it's hard to keep track of them\n- Some artifacts on small text\n- No USB-C\nIt's expensive, but the 4K QD-OLED Ultragear 32GS95UE has a great balance of features, design and performance. It's got excellent display quality -- all the benefits of OLED, including true blacks for high contrast, full P3 gamut coverage, good color accuracy and fast pixel refresh. LG throws in a ton of panel features, such as 240Hz/480Hz dual-refresh rate support (although 480Hz is only in 1080p), built-in color profiles that are updateable via LG's software and an optional color calibrator, almost over-granular control over display settings and more.\nIn addition, the monitor has terrific integrated under-screen speakers that are significantly better than those you typically find in any monitor. They're loud enough to be usable (and definitely louder than the usual pair of dinky 2W drivers), and are definitely up to ambient audio gameplay, music and movies; the drawback to the design is that, off-angle, the sound gets a bit muffled.\nIt's my top pick at the moment, but that's because it offers a good balance, not because it's flawless. It has quite a few flaws -- for a monitor in its price class -- including no DisplayPort 2.1 support, no USB-C (for either video input or power delivery) and artifacts on small text that may be a deal-killer for some people. The stand is pretty standard, and while sturdy, it feels a bit plasticky.\nMy test measurements showed decent but not stellar accuracy out of the box -- not sufficient for color-critical work, at least. Standard white points are generally around 6300K, gamma 2.2-2.3 and brightness is about 265 by default but can hit as high as 400 nits in SDR. Accuracy averages under 3 Delta e 2000, but you can probably improve it with a calibration tune-up. HDR peak brightness hovers around 650 nits for a 10% window -- that's with peak brightness set to low but which has the best tone-mapping curve -- but you can push it to over 1,200 nits in a 1% window if you crank everything. You really don't want to.\nThe display is nominally priced at $1,400, and I don't know that I'd pay that much for it. It's relatively new and still has dropped to as low as $1,000 with discounts, so if you can find it for that or less it's a good deal.\nPros\n- Solid performance and features for the price and class\n- Versatile built-in stand\nCons\n- Dimmer than the specs indicate, though not bad\n- Don't bother with HDR: it's too dim for a real HDR display\nFrom its 16-inch size to its versatile kickstand to its slim, lightweight build, the Z1RC is impressive for its price. The 2,560x1,600 resolution helps make everything sharp at this size, and it's exceptionally colorful, covering as much as 94% of the DCI-P3 color space and completely covering the sRGB color space in our testing. It\u2019s not the brightest display, but at over 360 nits as measured, it's impressive for a portable monitor, and combined with an anti-glare finish, it's easy to see in most conditions.\nThe Z1RC is pretty flexible with how you set it up, too. It has two USB-C ports and can run off a single-cable connection with a compatible device. Its second port is handy if you need auxiliary power or when you need broader compatibility with its mini HDMI input. A built-in kickstand also makes it easy to prop the monitor up horizontally and vertically. Of the portable monitors I\u2019ve tested recently, the Arzopa Z1RC leads the way in many respects, and the fact that it\u2019s also one of the most affordable options cements its place as a leading option.\nPros\n- Great gaming performance and quality\n- Excellent color and tonal accuracy, notably in the dark shadow areas\n- Nice set of controls\n- Three-year warranty against burn-in\nCons\n- Radiates some heat through the screen\n- Annoying connector arrangement and cable management\nThe combination of OLED with Samsung's Quantum Dot color technology made this Alienware 34-inch a standout when it launched a few years ago. It still delivers great gaming performance and quality, terrific color and tonal accuracy (notably in the dark shadow areas, where OLED is weak), solid HDR support, a USB hub, a decent set of controls and an above-average three-year warranty against burn-in, making it hard to beat at its lower price.\nIt's not perfect: It doesn't have speakers, though the ones built into monitors tend to be pretty lame, and I'm not thrilled with the design of the connector layout and cable management, to mention a couple nitpicks. But it's certainly a top all-around choice.\nIn September 2023, Alienware announced a slightly less expensive followup model, the AW3423DWF, which was essentially the same panel, but it supports FreeSync Pro and VESA Adaptive-Sync instead of G-Sync, has two DP connectors and one HDMI (versus the opposite on the older model) and 120Hz VRR when hooked up to a console. There might be some other tweaks since it loses the extra overhead of the G-Sync silicon (for instance, it supposedly can mount closer to a wall with a VESA mount).\nPros\n- Excellent color accuracy and Apple-standard color profiles\n- Good speaker system for a monitor\nCons\n- No physical controls -- all settings only via MacOS\n- No HDR\n- Meh Windows compatibility if that matters to you\n- Height adjustable stand is extra cost and no choices allow swiveling or rotation\n- Only a single input connection\n- No easy-access ports\nPricey but pretty -- with excellent color accuracy and reference profiles plus a good, six-speaker audio system -- the Apple Studio Display gives Mac ecosystem fans exactly what one expects from Apple.\nThat includes some of the downsides as well, such as a lack of physical controls, no HDR support, extra cost to geta stand that lets you adjust the height (with no swivel or rotation), a single input connection and all three USB-C ports on the back rather than somewhere more easily accessible.\nPros\n- Nice and roomy\n- Generally solid performance for the money\n- Includes VESA mounting hardware\nCons\n- Don't buy for HDR--like most DHDR 400 monitors it's not worth it\n- Action-gaming can have motion blur\n- Somewhat low resolution for its size\n- Little to no documentation plus a lot of mysterious settings is confusing\nThe 40-inch flatscreen Innocn trades some excellence for value, making it a solid general-purpose monitor if you need a big 'un for less and are OK with above average, but not best-in-class, gaming or color-critical accuracy. Plus, it ships with VESA mounting hardware in the box, which is convenient if you want to mount it on a wall or an arm, and unlike a lot of \"value\" competitors, it has a USB-C connection with 90-watt power delivery.\nLike many big-for-less displays, the Innocn has somewhat low resolution for its size -- 3,440x1,440 pixels -- but if you normally scale your view, then it should suit. Gaming is solid, but if you play games with really fast moving action, the motion artifacts may bother you. It does handle 144Hz (DP) and 100Hz (HDMI) refresh rates, though. And it has a lot of features that are either minimally effective or undocumented.\nSpecifications for recommended monitors\n| Alienware 34 QD-OLED (AW3423DW) | Apple Studio Display | Arzopa Z1RC | Innocn 40C1R | LG Ultragear 32GS95UE | |\n| Price | $900 | Starts at $1,599.

With the update, Sony fixed one of my biggest pet peeves, the horrible stand.\nAlienware AW3225QF ($1,000): OLED screens tend to be glossy, which a lot of people like; colors pop more and they tend to look a little slicker. If you're in front of the screen for hours or there's particularly reflective stuff behind you (like a window, for example) your eyes and brain will thank you for a less reflective screen. The Alienware AW3225QF's fits the bill.\nHP Omen 27QS ($220): This is a solid 1440p budget model -- pretty low-end for gaming but OK for general use -- but it's only worth the money if you can find it on sale.\nFactors to consider\nThe trick to finding the right general-purpose monitor is getting sufficient display area, contrast, color and features (most importantly, connections) at an affordable price without sacrificing too much elsewhere. Here's my advice on what to consider to get the most for your money.\nSize\nAll else being equal, if you've got the space and budget, bigger is almost always better. Screen size labeling is based on the diagonal measurement: That made it easy to compare monitor sizes when almost every screen had the same aspect ratio -- essentially the proportions of the screen rectangle, which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical pixels. Wide and ultrawide screens on desktops and newer ratios on laptops (such as 3:2 or 16:10) make cross-size comparisons a little more difficult. You may need to factor in the aspect ratios your favorite games support. If they only offer 16:9 options, configuring them for a widescreen 21:9, 24:10 or 32:9 monitor can be annoying and frustrating; you may also be able to save some money.\nIf you remember your geometry and algebra, you can calculate the width and height of the display if you also know the aspect ratio. (Because width/height = aspect ratio and width\u00b2 + height\u00b2 = diagonal\u00b2) The further from 1:1 the aspect ratio is, the wider the screen and more of it will be out to the sides -- and therefore in your peripheral vision if you're sitting close. It will also let you figure out the physical dimensions of the screen, most notably the width, to ensure it will fit in the allotted space.\nDPI Calculator can do the math for you, but keep in mind that the numbers only represent the panel size, not the size of the display, which includes bezels and the mount. Nor does it take into account curved displays, which tend to have smaller horizontal dimensions than their flat-screen equivalent.\nResolution\nResolution, the number of vertical by horizontal pixels that comprise the image, is inextricable from screen size when you're choosing a monitor. What you really want to optimize is pixel density, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display, because that's what primarily determines how sharp the screen looks as well as how big elements of the interface, such as icons and text, can appear. If you're gaming with a controller at distances further than you'd be sitting at a desk, it can be critical. For instance, I've discovered that I can't read the text well enough to even make it through a tutorial in 1440p on a 32-inch monitor from more than about 4 feet away.\nStandard resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio include 4K UHD (3,840x2,160 pixels), QHD (Quad HD, 2,560x1,440 pixels) and FHD (Full HD, 1,920x1,080 pixels): You're better off looking at the numbers than the alphabet soup because when you get to variations like UWQHD they can get mind-bogglingly ambiguous. When you see references to \"1080p\" or \"1440p,\" it's shorthand for the vertical resolution. Examples of widescreen resolutions, which you'll tend to see in 34-inch and larger curved displays, include 3,440x1,440 pixels (21:9) and 5,120x1,440 pixels (32:9).\nOn a 27-inch display, 1,920x1,080 has a pixel density of 81.59 ppi. On a 24-inch display, 1080p works out to 91.79 ppi. Because a higher density is better (up to a point), FHD will look better on the smaller screen. This also depends on your vision: For me, too low a resolution and I can see the pixel grid and at slightly better than that I see nothing but jaggies on small serif type. So \"optimal\" really depends on what you're looking at and personal preference. My preference for working, highly detailed sims, games with a lot of text and so on is at least 100ppi; if you're moving so fast there's no time to stop and shoot the flowers, you can probably drop to as low as 90ppi. Once again, the DPI Calculator can do the math for you. (A related spec is dot pitch, the size of the space between the center of the pixels, which is just the inverse of pixel density. For that, smaller is better.)\nBecause of the way Windows works (and MacOS, too), you're always better off with the highest resolution possible: You can always change the settings to make things that are too small on a high-res screen larger and change settings to increase frame rates, but you can't make things that are too large on a low-res screen bigger.\nScreen type\nOLED or QD-OLED generally have the best contrast, color and pixel refresh speeds, although they may have some artifacts on text because OLED's one-pixel-one-color structure doesn't antialias (essentially blur the edges of the characters) as well as the filter array technologies (three-primaries-one-pixel-one backlight) used by other panel types. IPS screens with LED backlights are cheaper but still good -- IPS is the best alternative. If they use Samsung's Quantum Dot technology they have better color, and IPS Black panels have better contrast than straight IPS because of its deeper blacks.\nColor\nThe bigger the color gamut the screen covers the better. At a minimum, you want 100% sRGB, but 90% or higher P3 (also known as DCI-P3) is best, as it delivers more colors. Look for specific gamut coverage percentages rather than terms like \"1 billion colors,\" which are essentially meaningless because gamut coverage indicates which of the \"billion\" are included. If many of them fall outside the color space you need, they're pretty useless.\nIf your work or sideline requires accurate colors -- photo editing, video editing, 3D rendering and the like do if you need or want colors to display the way you shot or designed them -- keep in mind that there are various degrees of accuracy, and color management can be an extremely difficult exercise (in other words, if the colors look \"wrong,\" don't automatically blame your monitor). The most popular measure of visible variance from the \"correct\" color is Delta E, and the most commonly touted spec is a Delta E of less than 2. That's great for generally accurate color, but that's also an average over a series of color patches. If you need what I call \"color-critical accuracy,\" you really need a maximum Delta E of 2, as well as consistent gray scale. If you plan to output your work for printing, you may also need the monitor to cover more of the Adobe RGB gamut than today's typical sRGB or P3 -- sRGB is tiny and old, and P3 doesn't cover the cyan, yellow and magenta primaries you want for print.\nBrightness and HDR\nHigh dynamic range refers to scenes rendered with brighter highlights, greater shadow detail and a wider range of color, for a better-looking image. In order to produce a decent image that looks like you expect HDR to look, you want the monitor to hit a peak brightness of 600 nits (aka cd/m^2) in HDR mode -- you might be able to get away with lower for OLED, but I still would recommend less than 500 nits -- and it's fine if the peak is lower in the standard range, though you still don't really want it lower than 300 for a desktop monitor.\nFor gaming HDR, in contrast to TV HDR, it means more than just a prettier picture: The better you can see what's lurking in the bright and dark areas, the more likely you are to avoid danger and spot clues and looks a lot better than the black-level boost settings a monitor may have.\nAnd in photo or video editing, even if you don't plan to export as HDR, the greater brightness range provides some useful latitude when you're color grading or adjusting exposure more precisely.\nPorts and connectors\nIf you plan to connect to your computer via USB-C, make sure the monitor explicitly lists that it supports video out (also known as alt mode or video over USB-C). Just because it has a USB-C port doesn't necessarily mean it can get video input that way. And if you want a real USB hub, you should make sure it includes the types of USB ports you need; for instance, a lot of high-end monitors (surprisingly) have an old USB-B 3.0 connector feeding the monitor's USB-A connections, which can be a pain or limiting.\nPrice\nUnless you can't afford it, assume you'll pay at least $300 (full price, not discounted) for a current-generation model, closer to $600 minimum for OLED and/or decent HDR.\nHow we test monitors\nAll measurements were performed using Portrait Display's Calman Ultimate 2021 R4 and later software using a Calibrite ColorChecker Display Plus (formerly X-Rite i1Display Pro Plus) and a Murideo Six-G pattern generator for HDR testing where necessary, or the Client3 HDR patterns within Calman, where possible. How extensive our testing is depends on the capabilities of the monitor, the screen and backlight technology used, and the judgment of the reviewer.\nOn the most basic models we may stick with just brightness, contrast and color gamut, while on more capable displays we may run tests of most user-selectable modes for gaming or color-critical usage, uniformity and so on. For the color work, we may also run tests to verify how white point accuracy varies with brightness.\nColor accuracy results reported in units of Delta E 2000 are based on Calman's standard Pantone patch set, plus the grayscale and skin tone patches. White points results are based on both the actual white value plus the correlated color temperature for the entire gray scale (21 patches, 0 to 100%) rounded down to the nearest 50K as long as there are no big variations. We also use Blur Busters' motion tests to judge motion artifacts (such as ghosting) or refresh rate-related problems that can affect gaming.\nMonitor FAQs\nWhat screen size do I need?\nShould I get two screens or one ultrawide?\nShould I get a curved or flat monitor?\nWhat's the best refresh rate for a monitor?\nDoes color accuracy matter?\nNeed more guidance? We've got more detailed info on what to look for in a general-purpose monitor and more specifically what's important in a gaming monitor."

      "text": "I first started using the Pomodoro Technique back in 2014 when some then-co-workers introduced it to me during a brainstorming session. The Pomodoro Method aims to improve focus and productivity while reducing distractions using basic timers, and I found it worked splendidly for me. If your work environment is anything like mine, you're contending with a bevy of competing attention-grabbers.\nWhether you\u2019re in an office, working remotely or in a hybrid situation, distractions lurk everywhere. In an office, co-workers can pop their head into your cubicle at any time and there\u2019s the noisy copy machine. At home, you\u2019ve got Slack or email notifications, attention-seeking pets and partners on their own Zoom calls. Outside of work, a Pomodoro app timer can be nifty around the house -- I'll often use it when clearing out my personal email inbox or organizing files in my Google Drive.\nI first began working from home full-time in 2016 and experimented with various techniques to give my day structure. One of my tricks, the Pomodoro Technique, aims to improve focus and productivity while reducing distractions. Nine years later -- and continuing to work remotely full-time -- I still keep a tab open with TomatoTimer for time management. Here\u2019s how I use the Pomodoro Technique to stay (mostly) focused, and why you should consider using it.\nThe Pomodoro Technique strives to improve focus, boost productivity and limit distractions\nPomodoro means \u201ctomato\u201d in Italian. The Pomodoro Technique gets its name from those tomato-shaped kitchen timers and was created in the 1980s by Francesco Cirillo. The premise is that you pick a task and focus on just that for a set period of time. When you\u2019re done, you take a short break, then do another Pomodoro session. After you\u2019ve completed your fourth Pomodoro, you take a longer break, then get back to it.\nUsually, a Pomodoro is 25 minutes, a short break is 5 minutes and a long break is 15 minutes. Here\u2019s what a typical loop looks like over roughly 2 hours:\n1. Pomodoro\n2. Short break\n3. Pomodoro\n4. Short break\n5. Pomodoro\n6. Short break\n7. Pomodoro\n8. Long break\nYou can customize a Pomodoro to your liking -- the important aspect is keeping the deep focus, break, deep focus structure intact. For instance, here\u2019s how I might spend one of my Pomodoro sessions:\n1. Focus: Editing\n2. Break: Answering work emails and Slack messages\n3. Focus: Editing\n4. Break: Grabbing a coffee refill, answering Slack messages\n5. Focus: Editing\n6. Break: Walking my dog\n7. Focus: Writing\n8. Longer break: Replying to Slack messages and emails, preparing for a meeting\nHere\u2019s why the Pomodoro method works\nAfter using the Pomodoro method for eight years, I\u2019ve noticed a decided uptick in my productivity because of three main benefits. It fosters focus, minimizes distractions and makes you more mindful about your work.\nThe Pomodoro Technique creates dedicated focus time\nWhen you\u2019re in a Pomodoro session, the goal is to pick a task or tasks to work on during that timeframe. Essentially, you\u2019re creating an artificial deadline -- when the time goes off -- which should keep you more engaged than when left to your own devices.\nThere\u2019s built-in time for your mind to wander\nOur brains need breaks, and sometimes when we step away from working on a project, background processing -- when we\u2019re thinking about something subconsciously -- provides helpful breakthroughs. Often, when I\u2019m stuck on how to proceed with something while writing or editing, I\u2019ll later have an epiphany while walking my dog or making lunch. The Pomodoro Technique allows for mental breaks and fosters work-life harmony.\nYou\u2019ll probably be more mindful about your work\nBefore embarking on a Pomodoro session, you\u2019ll choose what to work on. Then, during your break following that time, it\u2019s an opportunity to reflect on what you accomplished -- or didn\u2019t. Maybe you finished earlier than expected, perhaps you\u2019ve still got work left or possibly you got distracted and focused on something else entirely. Regardless, using the Pomodoro method can make you more mindful of your work by building in regular goal-setting and to-do list checking.\nHere are my tips to get the most out of using the Pomodoro method\nHaving used the Pomodoro Technique for several years, I\u2019ve learned a lot about how to use it most effectively. Here\u2019s how to maximize your productivity.\nUse a timer app\nWhile you can use a watch or phone, I suggest using a dedicated Pomodoro timer. That way, you\u2019re not constantly checking the time on your watch or phone. The free TomatoTimer app -- which I use -- runs in a web browser. There\u2019s also the browser-based Marinara Timer and Session for MacOS, iOS and iPadOS. Or there's Toggl Track, which provides time-tracking capabilities along with a Pomodoro timer. If you want a timer that\u2019s not on your phone or computer, the Ticktime is a neat desktop Pomodoro device.\nReduce distractions any way you can\nDuring focus sessions, I recommend eliminating distractions as much as possible. I close as many tabs as possible and also rely on the OneTab Google Chrome extension -- which my colleague Mike Sorrentino introduced me to. I snooze notifications on Slack and my email, because answering messages gets blocked into my breaks between focus sprints. I also use a pair of noise-canceling headphones, the Sonos Ace, to foster a quiet environment (save for the movie soundtracks I play on Spotify while hammering away at the keyboard).\nBe flexible, but not too flexible\nThe Pomodoro Technique is a set of guidelines, not a strict mandate, so it\u2019s OK to bend the rules. For example, if I\u2019m in the middle of a writing groove and my timer goes off signaling a break, sometimes I\u2019ll just restart it and skip the break. If you\u2019re in the zone and want to ride that wave of productivity, keep going. Likewise, if I get an urgent Slack message at the beginning of a long deep focus session, I\u2019ll answer that -- you probably don\u2019t want to leave a co-worker waiting for an important reply. But by the same token, don\u2019t be too lackadaisical. You don\u2019t want to start doom-scrolling on Reddit when you should be working, or even replying to non-urgent Slack messages while you should be concentrating on another task.\nReview your to-do list regularly on short and long Pomodoro breaks\nThe built-in breaks are a great opportunity to review your to-do list, see what you accomplished during earlier Pomodoro sessions and check what you still need to do. I like to use my short and long breaks to reflect on what I\u2019ve gotten done and look ahead at what I have left.\nFor instance, I\u2019ll look at what I initially jotted down to concentrate on during previous focus periods -- like editing a draft or writing. Reviewing what I\u2019ve already accomplished gives me momentum, like a second wind while running. Alternatively, seeing that I strayed from my initial objective -- such as answering emails when I should have been writing -- motivates me to stay on task during my next deep focus session. This rumination can often lead to reshuffling priorities.\nThe Pomodoro Technique can boost productivity, but it\u2019s not for everyone\nWhile the Pomodoro method works for me, it may not work for you -- you\u2019ll need to try it to find out. If you do find it helpful, chances are you\u2019ll need to customize it to your liking, such as selecting a tomato timer app and figuring out how long you want your different work sessions or breaks to be.\nFor more tips, try these productivity hacks, learn how to become more efficient working from home and discover if these habits are ruining your productivity."

      "text": "Standing desks are on the rise, literally and figuratively. Sitting in a traditional desk for hours on end while working or doing projects can cause stiffness and fatigue, making it hard to focus. We've tested more than a dozen desks to find the best standing desk for any situation.\nOur Picks\nBeing able to change your standing desk height and work where it's comfortable for you has some great health benefits. The best desk for each person will depend largely on the desk's intended use and several other factors. To find a reliable standing desk we looked for quality desktop materials, tall heights, a strong lifting column and more. Add in the best office chair for the moments you're sitting and you'll be in for a much easier work day.\nWhat is the best standing desk?\nIn my testing, I found one desk that stands out among the others: the Branch Standing Desk. With a midlevel price tag and high-end build quality, the Branch perfectly fits most people's standing desk needs. It has four programmable heights, and the base is so sturdy that the desk feels solid, even at full extension.\nWhat we updated: December 2024\nWe added the Branch Four Leg Standing Desk.\nFebruary 2025\nWe added the Autonomous SmartDesk 5 standing desk.\nApril 2025\nWe added the Branch Desk Riser.\nBest standing desks of 2025\nPros\n- Lightweight and premium feeling materials\n- Quick and easy assembly\n- Can be assembled solo if needed\n- Memory of four heights\n- Cable tidy\n- Color options\nCons\n- Generic look\n- Very business-like feeling\nWhy I like it:\nAt first glance, the Branch standing desk looks pretty generic, but the level of craftsmanship is apparent on closer inspection. All of the materials feel premium with a weight that only comes from good engineering. Putting it together was simple and only took about 30 minutes on my own, though I think having two people would reduce that significantly. It was also extremely well packaged -- something that Branch does with all its products -- so it was in top shape once I had it all together. The Branch desk can remember four separate heights and has a handy cable door at the back to keep your desk clear and tidy.\nWho is it for:\nThose looking to replace their desk in an office or who regularly work from home will find this to be a great business-like desk. It's tidy, professional and very easy to use. Even if you don't like the office look, the warmer woods and grey leg options can give it a bit more personality as well. If you are furnishing an office, the Branch desk and Verve office chair from our best office chairs make a great combination.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nWhile the desk is well built with quality materials and is a great fit for most people, if you are looking for more features on your desk outside of the raising ability or something more on the budget side, this may not be the pick for you. Also, while there are options to give the desk a bit more of a unique look, it does tend to lean more toward a business-looking desk, so if you want personality, there may be a better choice for you.\n-- James Bricknell\nPros\n- Balance of cost and quality\n- The hand crank is fun\nCons\n- Some assembly issues\nWhy I like it:\nThis simple sit-stand desk nails the basics. The Trotten measures 47.25 by 27.5 inches. It has a sturdy, easy-to-clean work surface made of particleboard and fiberboard, as well as a steel base for a stable standing desk. This adjustable standing desk model doesn't have electric controls to raise or lower the desk height, but the manual hand crank (which can be mounted on the right or the left side), was easy to turn for adjustments. When you're done using it, you can slide it back under the desk.\nWho is it for:\nThe Ikea Trotten is an excellent option when you need a larger standing desk but don't want to spend too much money. If you just want the basics of a standing desk and aren't looking for any fancy features as a way to dip your toe in or not add any more electricity to your office space, this may be for you.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nIf you've ever tried to put together Ikea furniture you'd be surprised to see that this standing desk option is relatively easy to install, but I did need help screwing in some stubborn hardware. I ended up having to flip over the completed desk after finishing the setup, so if you think you may struggle to put this together alone and don't have help, you might have a hard time. Also, this desk doesn't have any electric raise or lower ability as it is handled by a hand crank. You'll need to be able to roll it up and down to the desired height.\nPros\n- Quality look and feel\n- Handy USB hub for charging\n- Plenty of storage\nCons\n- Took an age to build\nWhy I like it:\nI haven't had much luck finding desks that could be called executive. To be an executive desk requires a product to feel expensive and add some class to the room it is in. Other desks I've tested for this category have fallen behind that mark, with some of them missing parts or looking cheap despite the price tag. Not the Ark ES from Eureka, though. The desk looks amazing and is incredibly sturdy.\nThe standing part of the desk works well, with sensors to stop the desk from going down too far, and it even has a nice pop-up USB hub for charging your phone and tablet.\nWho is it for:\nAll around, the Ark ES is one of the nicest desks I've used and is a great option for those looking at getting an L-shaped standing desk. If you're looking for something to give your home office some gravitas, this is the desk for you. It's also great for someone looking for an option that will last longer than just a few years.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nWhile the desk looks beautiful once it's put together, it does take a lot of time to put together. Anyone who wants a quick build or a simple look to their desk should look elsewhere.\nPros\n- Five height memories\n- Quiet motors\n- Good cable management\nCons\n- Multi-person assembly\n- Long assembly time\n- Heavy\n- Expensive\nWhy I like it:\nI have used a lot of desks throughout my career, but I can honestly say I've never used a desk quite like the Magnus Pro XL. It is at once the most industrial-looking table, while also giving off huge gamer energy. It has a five-setting standing system, and the motors are some of the quietest I've heard while testing. The motion is smooth, and even though the desk weighs quite a lot, it rises quickly and without hassle. I never thought of using a standing desk for gaming before, but it really helps to break up the hours of sitting.\nIf gaming is your job and you need a large desk to help you, I cannot recommend the Magnus Pro XL enough.\nWho is it for:\nWhen gaming, you tend to have a lot of extra cables and extra monitors so you need a few extra features. If you can manage the cost of getting the extras, I would recommend it. The cable management is already excellent with the built-in power supply unit, as well as the large trench down the back, but the optional magnetic conduit lets you hide all of your wiring. I especially liked the PC mount that connects your gaming tower to the leg, making it rise with the table so your cables don't get stretched as the desk moves.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nMeasuring 70 inches long and made almost exclusively of metal parts, this desk is not meant for one-person assembly. Putting this desk together with just one person took two hours. If you don't have a way for someone to help you, you may want to consider another desk. Aside from this, the cost of this desk is my only sticking point. Fully loaded, it will set you back $1,700, although you could reduce that with fewer optional extras.\nPros\n- Perfect for a smaller space\n- Easy to build\n- Stand notifications\n- Quality material\n- Simple controls\nCons\n- Doesn't work for multiple large monitors\nWhy I like it:\nThe Branch Duo is the company's latest line of standing desks and uses a very simple control mechanism to set heights. The display is simple and clean, and all of the accessories just ooze quality. Building it was simple, taking me less than 30 minutes, and the size is perfect for smaller spaces.\nWho is it for:\nThe Branch Duo is big enough for a couple of smaller monitors or one big one, with plenty of room on the top for a laptop. So if you have a smaller setup, it will fit your equipment perfectly. I especially like the notifications that you can set to remind you to stand or sit throughout the day. Standing desks are designed to help with your health, but they only work if you remember to do it, so if you're looking for that nudge but tend to forget on your own, this is designed to help you. If you'd like a desk with a keyboard tray, Branch has accessories that are compatible with the Duo.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nSome setups have multiple monitors or need a lot of desktop space for other reasons. When you're looking to really fill a room and have space for a bigger setup, you'll want to look at another desk.\nPros\n- Lots of accessories\n- Lots of color choices\nCons\n- Legs are thinner than I like\nWhy I like it:\nNot only was this model easier to install than expected (I only needed a few tools, and Uplift includes accessories for no extra cost to organize all those pesky device cables), but it was by far the most customizable standing desk of the bunch. It also included a wireless foot switch accessory if I'd like to raise and lower the desk via a pedal at my feet (in addition to the keypad).\nI tested the 48- by 30-inch Uplift desk with a white frame and rubberwood desktop, complete with one cupholder grommet and one power grommet (the power grommet brings two outlets up to the desktop so you can more easily charge your phone or other handheld devices) and a paddle keypad that can be pressed up or down to raise/lower your desk. Overall it's an excellent, sturdy desk that seems durable enough to stand up to years of use.\nWho is it for:\nDesks can be a personal piece of furniture, created in your own vision. Those who love to add accessories and choose colors will appreciate the expansive options you have with the Uplift Standing desk. It gave me the basic options, including five desk sizes, a handful of frame colors (gray, dark gray, white or black) and over two dozen desktops, ranging from laminate (most affordable) to solid wood. From there, multiple additional accessories could be added, such as grommet covers that screw into either side of the desk for additional storage, outlets and more. There are also five different keypads to choose from in a black finish and three different keypad options in gray and white.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nThe one downside of this desk is the hefty price tag. While it isn't the most expensive desk on the list, it isn't exactly a budget pick. If you're not interested in any of the extras, this may not be a useful desk for you.\nPros\n- Quality materials\n- Sleek appearance\n- Easy assembly\n- Smooth and quiet movement\nCons\n- Two-person assembly\nWhat I like:\nThe Branch Four Leg Standing Desk is a great, lightweight, motorized standing desk that is made with quality materials. From the moment I got it out of the box and began putting it together, I could tell these parts would last. The touch screen is very quick to respond, making it easy to make small adjustments to the height, and it displays what height it is currently at, so seeing how much adjustment may be needed is easy. The memory can be set to three different heights.\nMany standing desks only have two legs, as that can tend to make for a smoother transition from sitting to standing height since there are less moving parts. However, this four-leg desk has no trouble with sturdy and stable movement.\nPutting this together was a fairly quick job, taking only an hour for me to do alone, and it did come with all the tools I needed.\nWho is it for:\nThis four-legged standing desk is a great fit for any home office and works for many needs. One of the top things I noticed is if you're looking for a desk for a more mobile setup for working from a laptop or a writing desk this can easily camouflage as a side table while you're not working. An added benefit to the desk is its very sleek, customizable appearance with two leg color and four desktop options.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nI would recommend having someone help as it would probably cut the time in half and prove a little easier with the weight of the legs. I will note that you want to be sure to pay close attention to the instructions, as I easily got too ahead of myself and did some pieces backwards. This isn't a simple build, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll want a different desk.\nPros\n- Desktop space\n- Cable management\n- Rounded front edge\n- Included power strip\nCons\n- Anti-collision sensitivity\n- Included hooks are just a little too small\n- Release on height is slow to respond\nWhat I like:\nWhen cable organization is the goal, the Autonomous SmartDesk 5 Pro is the desk. All of the cable management items, like a 3M cable organizer, cable management tray and magnetized cable runner, come included with the desk. With all the cables managed and out of the way, you have a lot of desktop space to play with.\nThe SmartDesk 5 Pro is an electric motor desk that is quiet, quick and very easy to use and has three memory options. When you're choosing your heights and free-adjusting the desk it's important to watch where the cable tray organizer is in comparison to your PC if you keep it underneath, as a full-size tower will not fit underneath with how low the tray goes. However, this is generally shorter than most people will need the desk to be. For reference, I'm 5' 1\" and I don't need it on the lowest setting for sitting.\nBuilding it took me about 1.5 hours by myself (this does include cable management time) and it was a little heavy to do alone, but it is possible. You'll just need to be careful.\nWho is it for:\nI love to have all my cords organized and largely out of sight, and if you are looking for good cable tray organizers on the standing desk you're looking for, the Autonomous SmartDesk 5 Pro may be for you. The cable tray organizer on the SmartDesk 5 hides all the unsightly cords you may get from the cabling of an electric desk and general PC setup and is easy to access with hand knobs and a hinge to open it. Inside the tray you also get a built-in power supply strip with three outlet plugs.\nIn addition to the cable tray for organization, you also get a 3M cable organizer to stick onto the back of the desk to keep speaker, monitor, keyboard and mouse cables clean as well as a magnetized cable runner you attach to the back of the desk leg. The magnet is very strong and easy to stick on. It is big enough to hold both the desk cable and the power strip cord with room to spare.\nThe rounded front edge is so comfortable for those who, like me, tend to lean on the front of the desk a lot.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nThe sensitivity of the anti-collision as you adjust height is a little bit stronger than most when it comes to preventing damage by lowering onto desk chair arms or other objects, but this could be seen as a benefit, as the desk protects the motor from damage by trying to push down through anything. However, if you plan to have a lot of things around the desk that might end up triggering this it may get in the way. I did find myself having to figure out what item was triggering it from time to time and I don't have much under my desk. If you're looking for the most responsive desk when it comes to releasing the buttons on the touch screen, I'd say this desk has a little bit of a delay compared to others on this list, but not an inconvenient delay.\nAn item that is included is a pair of bag hooks that allow you to hang items underneath the desk, utilizing otherwise empty space. I was hoping to use these for my headphones but they weren't quite wide enough and I found myself knocking the hooks off regularly due to the short back end of the hook. If you saw this and were hoping for the same, you might want a desk or accessory more designed for that. When used for their intended purpose of hanging bags, they are a great hook size, but could still use a little more length in the back to keep it hooked to the desk.\nBest desk riser\nBranch Desk Riser\nPros\n- Rounded desktop edge\n- Desktop space\n- Mobility\n- Easy to adjust\n- Slim for simple storage\nCons\n- A little too heavy to carry back and forth\n- Stiff at first\nWhat I like:\nIn the case that you don't have a way to get a full standing desk, sometimes standing desk converters can be a great substitute. With the Branch Desk Riser, you get plenty of space and a comfortable edge to use while standing. It's lightweight but feels very sturdy and could easily be an option that is moved on and off the desk regularly.\nInitially, I was worried about the ease of getting the riser back down once it was up, however, after a few uses, this loosened up and was much easier to move back and forth. Adjusting the height is intuitive, and the riser is very responsive as soon as you release the handle. It can stop anywhere in between the maximum and minimum heights, so it will be just right for you. Best of all, no assembly required!\nWho is it for:\nWhile the size of the desk riser top makes it harder to carry around, it would be a great option for something to use at home or if you have a way to keep it somewhere in your office. It may not be a choice for something to carry to and from work, but it can be moved on and off the desk and into a stored area easily, thanks to its slim body. It's also a great choice if you're looking for something at a lower price point.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nThis riser is just big enough to hold a laptop with a little extra room around it, so it isn't going to add space or accommodate a big setup. If you truly want a full desk, the riser may not be enough of a fix for this problem.\n| Desk | Type | Height Range | Lift Capacity | Desktop Size | Warranty |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Branch Standing Desk | Electric | 26\"-52\" | 275 lbs | 48\"x30\" or 60\"x30\" | 10 years |\n| Ikea Trotten standing desk | Manual | 28.375\"-48\" | 110 lbs | 47.25\"x27.5\" | 10 years |\n| Eureka Arke ES executive desk | Electric | 29.5\"-47.25\" | 220 lbs | 60\"x26.375\" | 1 year electric modules - 5 years other (excludes desktop) |\n| SecretLab Magnus Pro XL | Electric | 25.6\"-49.2\" | 265 lbs | 70\"-31.5\" | 5 years |\n| Branch Duo standing desk | Electric | 28\"-47.5\" | 275 lbs | 36\"x24\" or 48\"x24\" or 58\"x27\" | 10 years |\n| Uplift Standing Desk V2 | Electric | 25.3\"-50.9\" | 355 lbs | 42\"x30\" or 48\"x30\" or 60\"x30\" or 72\"x30\" or 80\"x30\" | 15 years |\n| Branch Four Leg Standing Desk | Electric | 27.3\"-44.6\" | 225 lbs | 48\"x27\" or 59\"x27\" | 10 years |\n| Autonomous SmartDesk 5 | Electric | 29.5\"-48.5\" or 26\"-51.5\" | 330 lbs | 53\"x29\" | 10 years frame - 2 years top |\n| Branch Desk Riser | Manual - Riser | 2.5\"-15.8\" | 26 lbs | 30.7\"x24.3\" | 3 years |\nWho should buy a standing desk?\nMany people aren\u2019t getting enough exercise or physical activity daily. We are spending more and more time working at our desks -- whether at home or in the office -- and this kind of sedentary lifestyle can be detrimental. Sitting for prolonged periods is linked to cardiovascular disease, obesity and other potential health risks. Scientists are still looking into exactly how much of a health difference standing positions can have against sitting, but standing desks can be quite a useful investment even if you won't stand at one eight hours a day.\nAvoiding working from your desk all day isn't always possible, but standing desks can help avoid the ill effects. Most standing desks have a stable desk frame that lets you adjust the height of your desk so you can choose to sit every now and then. If you have a desk lifestyle and want to reduce the amount of time you spend sitting, a standing desk may benefit you.\nHow I tested standing desks\nTo test each standing desk, I started by building each one and noting the ease or difficulty, including whether I needed help with any of the steps. Making the desk solo may be a make-or-break feature for some buyers. I selected desks of different sizes and styles to see if any had a better feel than the others and to make sure we tested for a variety of needs, like lots of desktop space or a desk that would fit well in small areas. Some are controlled manually, while others have electric motors for height adjustment. Either way, the ease of the lift was an important note since this is the draw of a standing desk. I spent a full day working at each one -- switching between sitting and standing -- making notes when something worked particularly well or caused a problem.\nOther products we tested\nI tested the Seville Classics Airlift Height Adjustable Desk with Glass Top, the Seville Classics Airlift Pro S3 Electric Height Adjustable Standing Desk (no longer available), the Steelcase Solo Sit-To-Stand Desk and the Fezibo Height Adjustable Electric Standing Desk with Double Drawer, but they didn't make the cut. The Airlift with Glass Top came close to earning a spot above. It's a beautiful, sturdy desk at a midrange price. It also features a small center drawer for holding the basics. Unfortunately, its built-in touchscreen wasn't very responsive and the two USB-A ports, while theoretically a nice tech feature, are outdated for most of today's phones and tablets.\nThe Airlift Pro S3 was a decent desk, but it was a little tougher to install than the others in its size range, and it had a cheaper-looking finish than the overall winner for best standing desk (the Vari desk).\nThe Steelcase Solo desk was surprisingly simple to install for its size (the same as the Vari desk). Instead of using screws to install the legs, these simply lock into place. The desk is sturdy, looks nice and is quiet when raising and lowering. The Vari has a more sophisticated control panel and a nicer-looking finish and comes with desk accessories.\nThe Fezibo model was intriguing to me because of its built-in storage, but I found this model more difficult to assemble than many of the others. Still, it's a reasonable option if you'd like storage compartments integrated into your desk and two levels: one for holding your monitor and the other for your keyboard and related accessories.\nAs always, consider your specific needs before you buy a sit-stand desk. Do you have a lot of space and a higher budget? Consider the Vari or Uplift models. The Ikea model is a fantastic midsize manual desk at a great price. Regardless of your home setup, one of these models is bound to suit your needs. If you aren't sold on a standing desk, consider a standing desk converter for your existing desk instead.\nFactors to consider when buying a standing desk\nAs with any new piece of furniture, you'll want to take a little time to balance your needs with the space and budget you have for it.\nWhat is your budget?\nPrices range widely for standing desks, but you can find a great one to suit your needs at almost any budget. As noted above, the Ikea Trotten Standing Desk was my favorite option under $350.\nHow much space do you have?\nMake sure you have enough space for your standing desk before you make your purchase. Don't just consider the room it's going in, either. Also think about the doors, stairwells and other places the box must pass through. It might fit in your planned office space, but if you can't get it up your third-floor walk-up, you'll be in trouble.\nHow tall do you want to go?\nAll height-adjustable desks have a low and a high range for sitting and standing, but the height adjustment ranges aren't universal across different styles and brands. If you're on the shorter or taller end, certain models might not be comfortable for you, so check the specs beforehand to determine if you'll be comfortable using the desk, both sitting and standing.\nElectric or manual?\nAn electric standing desk will cost more than a manual standing desk, so your budget will absolutely come into play here, but there's more to consider. Manual desks, which have pneumatic pedals, hand cranks or other manual controls, are lighter and quieter because there's no heavy, noise-making motor mounted under your desk. Manual desks also don't require proximity to an outlet to work. Electric standing desks allow for easy raising and lowering with the press of a button. Some even have digital height readouts so that you can always return your desk to the exact same sitting or standing height settings.\nStanding Desk FAQs\nHow tall should your standing desk be?\nThe specific height of your standing desk largely depends on your own height. If you're a shorter individual, you'll want to make sure it can adjust to a low standing height, and for taller people, you'll want it to be able to go higher. One of the biggest things we learned when switching to a standing desk is that ideally, the desk will sit where your elbows can rest comfortably at a 90-degree angle and your monitor is directly in front of your face so you're not straining your neck. This will have the least amount of wear and tear on your body while standing.\nWhat are different types of standing desks?\nOur best list focuses on two main types of standing desks, electric and manual sit-stand desks, there are also standing desk converters and fixed-standing desks. The desks on our list are either lifted via electric or manual means and can change height to fit either a seated or standing position, a standing desk converter is a stand you put on top of a seated desk to bring your monitors or laptop up higher, adding height to your mouse and screen without actually moving your desk. The fixed-standing desks don't have the option to lower them to a seated height.\nAre standing desks worth it?\nIf you're looking to lose weight, a standing desk alone may not help. Where the benefits do come in is by decreasing the amount of time your body is sedentary and improving your productivity. It's especially helpful for those who feel like sitting at their desk all day gives them neck and/or back pain. When struggling with these issues, you may find that a standing desk is very worth the cost.\nSomething to keep in mind with a standing desk is that standing for long periods can wear on the feet and legs as you get used to it. You'll want to be sure you're switching to sitting every once in a while to prevent this fatigue and be mindful of the shoes you choose to wear for the day.\nHow long will a standing desk last?\nThe length of time you can expect to get out of a desk depends on a few things -- quality, warranty and usage. A desk that's made of higher quality material will last much longer. When you have a desk with a longer warranty, you know you'll be able to get more years out of the desk. As with anything, the more the desk is moved up and down, the more wear the desk will have which may lessen the amount of time you get out of it. On average, you typically see a good-standing desk last around five to 10 years.\nWhat are the benefits of using a standing desk?\nA 2021 study has shown that people who worked at a standing desk were found to be more productive, healthier and less sedentary. This included a decrease in neck, shoulder and back pain as well as improved mood.\nDo I have to have my standing desk near a plug socket?\nThe proximity needed to a plug socket for your standing desk depends on your electronic setup as well as whether your desk is electric or has technical components like wireless chargers. If you have an electric lift desk, you will want it to be close enough to plug in so you can switch it from sitting to standing as the motors won't work without power. Those with a desktop computer will also want to be close to a plug so you can power your computer without cords trailing across the office.\nIf you have a well-charged laptop or don't plan to use a computer at your desk and you choose a manual standing desk with no electronics on top, then you wouldn't necessarily have to have your desk near a plug socket.\nAre standing desks adjustable?\nThere are fixed standing desks that are a certain height and don't move up or down, but the standing desks I recommend are all adjustable. The electric ones lower and raise at the push of a button, some even having memory settings for several different heights, while the manual ones have a crank or other mechanism you move to raise or lower the desktop. You'll want to check the minimum and maximum height on each desk, as they will all be different, to ensure it will be comfortable for your sitting and standing height.\nAre standing desks easy to assemble?\nAs with any desk, some are easier to assemble than others. Those with storage tend to have a few more pieces and would be easier to assemble with multiple people. Some are a more simple and light design, easy to put together on your own. My top pick, the Branch Standing Desk, only took about 30 minutes to put together alone.\nWhat is the maximum weight capacity of a standing desk?\nThe weight capacity of a standing desk will increase with heavier-duty materials for both the desktop and the frame, as well as the motors for electric desks. Typically, dual motor vs single motor desks will have a higher weight capacity, as will desks made of steel as opposed to aluminum. The Uplift Standing Desk V2 on my list carries the most at 355 lbs with its steel frame and dual motors, one for each leg of the frame."

      "text": "We've been reviewing MacBooks since the very first polycarbonate MacBook appeared in 2006 -- and we covered Apple's PowerBooks and iBooks before that. Apple's current laptop lineup is split between the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, and the differences between the two lines are significant. The current MacBook Pros are great for those who need higher-level processing and graphics performance for content creation, graphic design, advanced STEM work and gaming. The Air is more of an everyday laptop that favors portability over performance, though it has power to spare and a long battery life, according to our tests. That\u2019s why the MacBook Air is CNET\u2019s pick for the best MacBook for most people.\nOur Picks\nLAPTOP DEALS OF THE WEEK\nWhat is the best overall MacBook?\nWith the release of the M4 MacBook Air a few months ago, both the MacBook Pro and Air lines now feature Apple's latest silicon. The 15-inch MacBook Air acts as the bridge between the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro line, providing a bigger display without the MacBook Pro premium. With Apple dropping the price by $100 for the M4 MacBook Air models, the price gap between MacBook Air and MacBook Pro is even bigger than it was before.\nStarting at $1,199 at Apple (and regularly discounted at $1,099 at Amazon), the 15-inch Air sits in the sweet spot, making it the best MacBook for most people. As I sit here in July, the larger MacBook Air is my favorite MacBook for its roomy display, trim design and reasonable price. The smaller and cheaper 13-inch Air remains a great pick for students and others with busy lives and slim wallets. The older MacBook M1 is still available as a Walmart exclusive for just $599 for budget shoppers, and the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 provides the added power for graphics pros but at a great expense.\nFor more, please read my MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro comparison and you can also check out the new look and features of the next version of Apple's Mac operating system, MacOS Tahoe.\nRead more: Best VPN for Mac\nBest MacBooks of 2025\nPros\n- Optimal balance of screen size and system weight\n- M4 processor provides good balance of performance and battery life\n- Lower $1,199 starting price\nCons\n- 256GB SSD is too small for the price\n- $200 upcharge for more RAM or storage is steep\n- Smooth ProMotion display still exclusive to MacBook Pro\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air is proof that you don't need a Pro to get a larger display. It supplies a larger screen that you once found only on the pricier Pro models. If you're eyeing the 14- or 16-inch Pro models primarily for the added screen size, the MacBook Air 15 is the more affordable option you should go for, especially at its new lower starting price.\nWhy we like it\nThe roomy, 15.3-inch display is powered by Apple's M4 chip and 16GB of RAM. The M4 update adds incremental improvements (and a new sky blue color) to an already fantastic laptop that sits in the Goldilocks Zone of Apple's MacBook lineup.\nWho it's best for\nWith its roomy display, trim design and new lower starting price, the 15-inch M4 MacBook Air should be viewed as the default Air, with its cheaper and smaller 13-inch sibling a good alternative for students and others with tighter budgets and busy, on-the-go lifestyles.\nPros\n- Big performance gains from M1, Intel MacBook Airs\n- Great design, features\n- Support for two external displays simultaneously with MacBook display\n- 12-megapixel Center Stage camera\nCons\n- 256GB SSD might fill up fast\n- Expensive upgrades\nFor Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air, the bigger news than moving from Apple's M3 silicon to M4 chips is the drop in price.\nWhy we like it\nStarting at $999, the MacBook M4 Air is $100 cheaper than the entry point for the previous M3 models. In addition to a slight bump in performance over the previous generation, the M4 Air adds a Center Stage webcam, better support for external displays and a new ice blue color option.\nWho it's best for\nThe M4 refresh adds up to a good, if minor, update to an already fantastic laptop that\u2019s now more affordable for students and those on tight budgets. With its mix of strong overall performance, long battery life and a trim design, it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s such a popular laptop for campus life.\nPros\n- M1 Air easily outperforms old Intel versions\n- Great battery life\n- Fanless design runs cool and quiet\nCons\n- No external design or feature changes\n- No mobile broadband options, 5G or otherwise\nThis model has been surpassed, but not totally replaced, by the newer M2, M3 and M4 models. It's available at Walmart for $649, which is a hefty $350 less than its original price. It's also $350 less than the cheapest M4 Air.\nWhy we like it\nFor many years, this was everyone's favorite laptop. It was reasonably priced, thin, light and built like a tank. It could last for years and take lots of falls and bumps. You get only two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, but that's enough for most people, as long as you can get a compatible dongle.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great pick for budget shoppers looking for a speedy and stylish do-it-all laptop.\nPros\n- Fast\n- Excellent screen\n- Improved webcam\n- Same solid design as previous model\nCons\n- Heavy\n- Big drop in performance in low-power mode\n- Prone to fingerprint smudges\nApple's latest update to its 16-inch MacBook Pro delivers M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max processors, an improved webcam and an optional nano-texture nonreflective finish for the display.\nWhy we like it\nThe design remains unchanged from the previous version, but under the hood the new M4 Pro chip offers better overall performance and, sees big gains in multicore and rendering performance. Although the design didn't receive an update, it's still solid and offers a reasonable weight given the roomy display.\nWho it's best for\nGraphics pros and creators who need the power and big screen of the 16-inch MacBook Pro will be best served by this laptop. Like the previous series, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro processor starts at $2,499, and the M4 Max model starts at $3,499. If you need the speed, it's worth the dough.\nApple MacBooks compared\nSee how the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models measure up.\n| 13-inch MacBook Air (M4) | 15-inch MacBook Air (M4) | 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) | 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) | 16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Starting price | $999 | $1,199 | $1,599 | $1,999 | $2,499 |\n| CPU | M4 | M4 | M4 | M4 Pro | M4 Pro |\n| No. of CPU cores | 10 | 10 | 10 | 12 | 14 |\n| No. of GPU cores | 8 | 10 | 10 | 16 | 20 |\n| Starting RAM | 16GB | 16GB | 16GB | 24GB | 24GB |\n| Starting storage | 256GB | 256GB | 512GB | 512GB | 512GB |\n| Screen size | 13.6 inches | 15.3 inches | 14.2 inches | 14.2 inches | 16.2 inches |\n| Screen resolution | 2,560x1,664 pixels | 2,880x1,864 pixels | 3,024x1,964 pixels | 3,024x1,964 pixels | 3,456x2,234 pixels |\n| Weight | 2.7 pounds | 3.3 pounds | 3.4 pounds | 3.5 pounds | 4.7 pounds |\n| Dimensions (HWD) | 0.44 x 11.97 x 8.46 inches | 0.45 x 13.4 x 9.35 inches | 0.61 x 12.31 x 8.71 inches | 0.61 x 12.31 x 8.71 inches | 0.66 x 14.01 x 9.77 inches |\n| Connections | Thunderbolt 4 x2, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 4 x2, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 4 x3, HDMI, SDXC card, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 4 x3, HDMI, SDXC card, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 5 x3, HDMI, SDXC card, headphone, MagSafe 3 |\n| Battery | 52.6-watt\u2011hour | 66.5-watt\u2011hour | 72.4-watt-hour | 72.4-watt-hour | 100-watt-hour |\nMost recent additions\nThe new M4 versions of the MacBook Airs are the newest additions to the list. The 15-inch Air acts as the bridge between the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 and MacBook Pro line and offers fans the best of both worlds: a larger display without the MacBook Pro premium. Since Apple has dropped the price by $100 for the M4 MacBook Air models, the price gap between the Air and Pro has grown.\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nThe first fork in the road you'll come to when shopping for a MacBook is whether to follow the Air path or head down the Pro road. For people who are looking for an everyday home laptop or a work laptop for running basic office apps, a MacBook Air will suffice. An Air is also a better pick for students on tight budgets. For creative types who need the added processing and graphics muscle of Apple's new M4 Pro and Max chips, a MacBook Pro is worth the added cost. To help you find the right MacBook for your needs and budget, here are the main considerations to keep in mind.\nPrice\nThe entry price for a MacBook is $649. That gets you the M1 MacBook Air that was released in 2020, but that offer is exclusive to Walmart. If you are shopping at Apple, pricing starts at $999 for the13-inch MacBook Air M4 and $1,199 for the 15-inch MacBook Air M4. Stepping up to a MacBook Pro model starts at $1,599. Here are the starting prices of Apple's current MacBook lineup:\n- 13-inch M4 MacBook Air: $999\n- 15-inch M4 MacBook Air: $1,199\n- 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro: $1,599\n- 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro: $2,499\nSize and display\nIf you'll be taking your MacBook with you to class, work or even down to your local coffee shop most mornings, an Air is the better choice. The 13-inch MacBook Air models weigh less than 3 pounds, and the roomier 15-inch Air weighs only 3.3 pounds, which is still lighter than the 14-inch MacBook Pro.\nThe flip side to portability is screen size. The 16-inch MacBook Pro gives you ample room to work and multitask, while the 14-inch MacBook Pro tries to hit the sweet spot between roomy display and travel ease. Unless you need Pro-level performance, we feel the 15-inch Air does a better job of hitting that target.\n- 13.3-inch M1 MacBook Air: 13.3-inch display (2,560x1,600 pixels), 2.8 pounds\n- 13.6-inch M4 MacBook Air: 13.6-inch display (2,560x1,664 pixels), 2.7 pounds\n- 15.3-inch M4 MacBook Air: 15.3-inch display (2,880x1,864 pixels), 3.3 pounds\n- 14.2-inch M4 MacBook Pro: 14.2-inch display (3,024x1,964 pixels), 3.4 pounds\n- 16.2-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro: 16.2-inch display (3,456x2,234 pixels), 4.7 pounds\nProcessor\nThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. MacBooks have used Apple's own processors since the introduction of the M1 processor in 2020. The M1-based MacBooks were clear improvements over Apple's earlier Intel-based machines in terms of overall performance, efficiency and battery life. The M1 MacBooks were more powerful, boasted longer runtimes and operated more coolly and quietly.\nThe latest lineup of MacBook Airs feature Apple's latest M4 chip, and the MacBook Pro line offers a choice of M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max processors. The M4 MacBook Air models offer slightly better performance than the M3-based versions, but the jump in performance is not nearly the same as going from Intel CPUs to the M1.\nGraphics\nThe graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. Apple's M-series CPUs integrate the GPU. The more processing cores the GPU has, the better the graphics performance. Here's the breakdown:\n- M1: 7-core or 8-core GPU\n- M2: 8-core or 10-core GPU\n- M3: 8-core or 10-core GPU\n- M4: 8-core or 10-core GPU\n- M4 Pro: 20-core or 32-core GPU\n- M4 Max: 32-core or 40-core GPU\nMemory\nMemory (or RAM) is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. With the exception of the older M1 Air sold at Walmart, MacBook Air models now start at 16GB of RAM along with the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro. The minimum on the M4 Pro MacBook Pro models is 24GB, and the M4 Max MacBook Pros serve up 36GB or more.\nYou can't upgrade the memory on recent MacBooks post purchase, so you'll need to get all of the RAM you'll need up front. MacBooks are able to smoothly run MacOS and the preinstalled apps with the minimum RAM offered, but doubling the RAM will make your MacBook feel faster and likely lead to a longer life of the laptop.\nStorage\nMacBooks feature solid-state drives, or SSDs. MacBook Air models start with a 256GB SSD, and MacBook Pros offer a 512GB SSD at minimum. If you use cloud storage for your files, music collection and photo library, then you might be able to get away with a 256GB SSD without filling it up before too long. We were happy to see the 13-inch MacBook Pro with its paltry 256GB SSD go away -- Pro users need 512GB at the very least.\nHow we test laptops\nThe review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.\nOur benchmark tests consist of a core set we run on every compatible system, including several we can run on both MacOS and Windows PCs. There's also an extended set of tests for specific use cases, such as gaming or content creation, where systems may have more powerful GPUs or higher-resolution displays that need to be evaluated.\nFor the hands-on portion of the reiview, the reviewer uses the laptop for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features like the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well everything works given the cost, and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or trade-offs for the price.\nThe list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our How We Test Computers page.\nOther laptops we've tested\nHP OmniBook X Flip 16: While it has a handful of appealing features, this midrange 16-inch convertible ends up being a clumsy assemblage of disparate parts.\nLenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition: It offers a cheap path to an OLED ultraportable, but is a ThinkPad a ThinkPad without the little red nub in the middle of the keyboard?\nHP OmniBook X Flip 14: This two-in-one laptop offers style, value and configuration options abound, including a 3K OLED display for only an extra $100.\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13-inch): It\u2019s compact, solidly built and great for travel, but the 13.8-inch version is the better choice as your daily driver.\nDell 14 Plus: Skip the two-in-one and opt for the clamshell laptop I tested, when it goes on sale.\nAcer Swift Go 16 (2025): Built around a beautiful 16-inch OLED screen, the latest Swift Go 16 improves on its predecessors without significant price inflation.\nDell 16 Plus 2-in-1: This big-screen, mini-LED convertible laptop certainly has some positives but there are a few too many minuses to give this Plus a full-throated recommendation.\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition: It\u2019s a great business laptop but can get pricey fast with upgrades.\nAcer Swift 14 AI: This midrange Copilot Plus PC offers incredible battery life but is missing one key feature.\nHP EliteBook X G1a: X does not mark the spot for this biz laptop when the Ultra version costs roughly the same and supplies a far better display inside a slimmer, more compact design.\nHP EliteBook Ultra G1i: With its compact, elegant design and excellent OLED display, HP's flagship EliteBook is a fantastic machine -- but it's worth waiting for a sale before buying.\nLenovo Yoga Slim 9i 14 Gen 10: It's ultrastylish and ultracompact, but maybe don't hide the camera behind the display next time?"

      "text": "Our Picks\nDesks have many different shapes, features, sizes, prices and uses. Find the perfect desk for your needs with these picks we've personally tested. After looking at over a dozen standing desks, L-shaped desks, standard office desks and everything in between, these are the top choices. Complete your setup with one of the best office chairs or gaming chairs.\nWhat is the best desk?\nDepending on your needs, there are really two that I would say are the best. The Magnus from SecretLab is a fantastic standing desk for those who want a sleek-looking, gamer-inspired desk, while the Branch standing desk is a more traditional workspace designed for your work office.\nWhat we updated: April 2025\nWe added the Branch Desk Riser.\nThe best desk\nWhy I like it:\nI've used many desks throughout my career, but I can honestly say I've never used a desk quite like the Magnus Pro XL. It is the most industrial-looking table at once, while also giving off huge gamer energy. It has a five-setting standing system, and the motors are some of the quietest I've heard in my testing. The motion is smooth, and even though the desk weighs quite a lot, it rises quickly and without hassle. I never thought of using a standing desk for gaming before, but it helps to break up the hours of sitting.\nWho is it for:\nIf gaming is your job and you need a large desk to help you, I cannot recommend the Magnus Pro XL enough. I think they're worth it if you can manage the cost of getting the extras. The cable management is already excellent with the built-in power supply unit, as well as the large trench down the back, but the optional magnetic conduit lets you hide all of your wiring sins. I especially liked the PC mount that connects your gaming tower to the leg, making it rise with the table, so your cables don't stretch as the desk moves.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nMeasuring 70 inches long and made almost exclusively of metal parts, this desk isn't meant for one-person assembly. It took nearly 2 hours to put it all together, but once it's finished, it's a work of art. If you don't have the space or the help, I'd consider a different desk. The cost of this desk is my only other sticking point. With all the extras, you're looking at a price tag of about $1,600. While you could reduce that with fewer optional extras, it is worth noting.\nWhy I like it:\nAt first glance, the Branch standing desk looks pretty generic, but the level of craftsmanship is apparent on closer inspection. All the materials feel premium with a weight that comes only from good engineering. Putting it together was simple and only took about 30 minutes on my own, though I think having two people would reduce that significantly. It was also extremely well packaged -- something that Branch does with all its products -- so it was in top shape once I had it all together. The Branch desk can remember four separate heights and has a handy cable door at the back to keep your desk clear and tidy.\nWho is it for:\nThose looking to replace their desk in an office or who regularly work from home will find this a great business-like desk. It's tidy, professional and very easy to use. Even if you don't like the office look, the warmer woods and gray leg options can also give it a bit more personality. If you're furnishing an office, the Branch desk and Verve office chair from our best office chairs make a great combination.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nWhile the desk is well built with quality materials and is a great fit for most people, if you're looking for more features on your desk outside of the raising ability or something more on the budget side, this may not be the pick for you. Also, while there are options to give the desk a bit more of a unique look, it does tend to lean more toward a business-looking desk, so if you want personality, there may be a better choice for you.\nWhy I like it\nNot all of the best desks are specifically designed as computer desks. This Work Table from Everest is a brilliant example. Not only is it lovely to look at -- the powder-coated legs and bamboo top look great together -- but it can work in more spaces than just an office. While technically not a standing desk, it can be adjusted from desk height to bar height, giving you a lot of variety in how you want to sit or stand at it. I like it to be slightly higher than a normal desk so I can use it to take stuff apart while still being seated comfortably. The assembly was easily done by just one person. The Work Table comes with some nice cable management as an added bonus.\nWho is it for:\nMy last home didn't have a space specifically for an office, so I had to use my desk as a homework space and kids' sensory play area, too. The 72-inch version of the Work Table gives you ample room to have a computer on one end and anything else on the other. If you're looking for a versatile option outside a dedicated office space that doubles as a desk, the Everest Work Table is a great pick.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nLifting the desktop is a two-person job, so if you want to be able to move things around, you'll want to keep this in mind. When you have a dedicated office space that you want more of a sophisticated and dedicated look for, this probably wouldn't be your choice.\nWhy I like it:\nI haven't had much luck finding desks that could be called executive. To be an executive desk requires a product to feel expensive and add some class to the room it is in. Most of the desks I've tested for this category have fallen behind that mark, with some missing parts or looking cheap despite the price tag, but not in the case of the Ark ES from Eureka. After the (admittedly very long) build, the desk looks amazing and is incredibly sturdy. It feels like a desk you keep for decades, rather than a few years.\nWho is it for:\nThe appeal of a standing desk doesn't always match the need to give your home office that classy gravitas, but with the Ark ES you can have the best of both. The standing part of the desk works well, with sensors to stop the desk from going down too far, and it even has a nice pop-up USB hub for charging your phone and tablet if your work requires a lot of electronic devices.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nAs the Ark ES is a large desk, the assembly process was very long. So if you're looking for a simple and quick option and don't need a lot of desktop space, this is not it. There are also better choices for a more relaxed and personalized look.\nWhy I like it:\nThis light writing desk is a lot like many of the others I tested. Writing desks tend to be easy to put together -- this one took 10 minutes -- and are small in stature. It can hold maybe one monitor and a laptop comfortably, but not much else. The best feature, though, is the set of outputs. The Fenlo desk has a standard power outlet, two USB-A ports and built-in wireless charging. It is much easier to manage cables for your laptop, tablet and phone when you can access them from the front.\nWho is it for:\nThe beauty of the Fenlo is that it can be placed in almost any room and still look nice, for when you need to fit your desk into an established room. There are a lot of finishes to choose from too, and each one comes with a lamp to illuminate your work.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nThe Fenlo is very light, so it does suffer slightly from wobbling, even when its legs are tight. This only happened when I loaded it to its maximum weight, so if you're using just a laptop, you should be fine. However, if you have more of a setup or are concerned about a bit of wobble, you will want a larger desk.\nWhat I like:\nI am a huge fan of making and crafting. We have a Cricut Explore 3 set up at home and use it weekly. We also like to have enough space to move around, so using the Branch Daily Desk on casters is amazing, although they do cost an additional $59. During the day, it's pushed to the side of the office, with the Cricut at the back, and when we need it, we wheel it to the center of the room so we can use it from all angles.\nWho is it for:\nThe Daily Desk is an incredibly versatile desk that only took minutes to build. We have the optional caster legs, which I recommend if you want to use it as a crafting table, as we did, or as a simple desk for your child's room. As I say, it's versatile, so it can be used for just about any job.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nIf you prefer a taller desk, I'd say this one sits slightly lower than most I've tested.\nWhy I like it:\nMost standing desks have a clinical look to them, like they're designed for a drab office rather than your home. Not so with the mid-century standing desk. Its design with a dark wood surface, black drawer fronts and antique gold handles gives an air of '50s sophistication. The standing desk portion works well too, with three programmable heights and a sturdy structure that feels secure even at full extension. I especially like the center drawer that can fit your wireless keyboard and mouse to hide them from view and keep the midcentury aesthetic.\nWho is it for:\nThe Fezibo midcentury modern standing desk mixes the sophistication of the midcentury era with the technology of a sit-stand desk. It lets you keep your space tidy and your office looking sleek while taking care of your body, allowing it some movement throughout the day.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nIf you aren't going to use the standing feature, this desk probably isn't worth the price tag. The ability to raise and lower it as needed with three memory settings makes this a very affordable desk for getting that function, but it won't be worth it if you don't think you'll use it.\nWhy I like it:\nThe Branch Duo is the company's latest line of standing desks and uses a very simple control mechanism to set heights. The display is simple and clean, and all the accessories ooze quality. Building it was simple, taking me less than 30 minutes, and the size is perfect for smaller spaces.\nWho is it for:\nThe Branch Duo is big enough for a couple of smaller monitors or one big one, with plenty of room on the top for a laptop. So if you have a smaller setup, it will fit your equipment perfectly. I especially like the notifications you can set to remind you to stand or sit throughout the day. Standing desks are designed to help with your health, but they only work if you remember to do it, so if you're looking for that nudge but tend to forget on your own, this is designed to help you.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nSome setups have multiple large monitors or need a lot of desktop space for other reasons. When you're looking to fill a room and have space for a bigger setup, you'll want to look at another desk.\nWhat I like:\nThe Branch Desk Riser is a standing desk converter that offers an easy way to give yourself a standing option without changing your entire desk and without the use of electricity or a tiring hand crank. There is plenty of space on the riser top and it comes with a comfortable, curved edge. While it's fairly light, it's also very sturdy and can be moved on and off the desk regularly.\nUpon first use, the riser is a little stiff going up and down, but after a few short uses, it loosened up and was very easy to move back and forth. Using the side handle to move it is very intuitive and responsive - as soon as you release the handle, you set the height. Plus, there's no assembly required!\nWho is it for:\nWhile some people love the idea of having a whole standing desk, for others, that may not be an option. This is something you can use if you aren't able to replace your desk at work but would like to be able to stand for part of your day or if the price of a standing desk feels too steep. While carrying this to and from work may be cumbersome as it is a little too heavy to be hauled around, it is great if you can store it somewhere in the office or near your desk and pull it out when you need it. The slim body makes storing it a breeze.\nWho shouldn't buy it:\nIf you have large monitors, short cables or aren't working on a laptop, this probably won't fit what you need. There's not a lot of space on top to accommodate a whole desk setup.\nOther desks we tested\nNot every desk we test makes it onto the best list. Some of them aren't even good enough to get a mention. Some are close to being good enough that we're willing to mention them here. These desks had something wrong that kept them off the top list, but are decent if you can overlook the specific issue.\n- Homary Executive Desk: This desk from Homary looks fantastic when it is put together. The glossy white finish and antique gold accents give it the luxurious feel a $1,500 desk should have. All the individual parts have the weight you expect from an executive item, and once it's all put together, it looks absolutely stunning. The desk we received for testing had the wrong holes drilled for the hardware to build it, and it arrived damaged despite being strapped to a pallet. Homary did replace the broken part with no issues or complaints but could not fix the incorrectly drilled parts. This meant I had to go to Home Depot for new parts to fix it myself. Now, do I think this happens all of the time to all of Homary's products? No, otherwise it wouldn't still be in business. I couldn't test it properly if I had to buy the parts myself.\n- Monoprice Steel Frame Computer Desk: Gaming desks can be extremely expensive, especially when you add extras. This desk from Monoprice is simple, cheap, stable and has some neat extras like a headphone hook, cable management tray and an off-desktop cup holder. Having your beverage off to the side of the desk is a great idea. If you knock it over, the contents are going on the floor, not on the expensive electronics on your desk. The work surface is grippy, with grommets in the rear to push through cables. I wish these were a little bigger, but they do the job as long as you don't have too many cables. A notch in the front lets you get closer to the work surface while maintaining good posture. At the price, the Monoprice is a decent entry-level gaming desk, although I did note that not all of the holes that should have been predrilled were (as is the case with several desks I've reviewed). When the manual tells you to screw something in a specific place, there should be predrilled holes to make that happen or you could end up splitting the wood.\nDesks compared\n| Desk | Type | Height/Height Range | Desktop Size | Weight Capacity | Storage Space | Warranty |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| SecretLab Magnus Pro XL | Electric | 25.6\"-49.2\" | 70\" x 31.5\" | 265 lbs | None | 5 years |\n| Branch Standing Desk | Electric | 26\"-52\" | 48\" x 30\" or 60\" x 30\" | 275 lbs | None | 10 years |\n| Everest Work Table | Manual | 32\"-44.5\" | 44\" and 72\" | 750 lbs | None | N/A |\n| Eureka Ark ES | Electric | 29.5\"-47.25\" | 60\" x 26.375\" | 220 lbs | 2 door storage cabinet, 1 file cabinet | 1 year - electric modules; 5 years other |\n| Fenlo Writing Desk | Writing | 28.1\" | 39.4\" x 22\" | N/A | None | N/A |\n| Branch Daily Desk with Casters | Stationary | 28.5\" | 36\" x 24\" or 48\" x 24\" or 58\" x 27\" | 200 lbs | None | 10 years |\n| Fezibo Midcentury Modern Electric Standing Desk | Electric | 28\"-47.6\" | 55.2\" x 25.62\" | 154 lbs | 3 drawers | 2 years - motor and electronics; 5 years - other |\n| Branch Duo Standing Desk | Electric | 28\"-47.5\" | 36\" x 24\" or 48\" x 24\" or 58\" x 27\" | 275 lbs | None | 10 years |\n| Branch Desk Riser | Desk Riser | 2.5\"-15.8\" | 30.7\" x 24.3\" | 26 lbs | None | 3 years |\n| Homary Executive Desk | Stationary | 29.5\" | 27.6\" x 55.1\" or 27.6\" x 63\" or 27.6\" x 70.9\" | 176.4 lbs | 3 drawers | 1 year limited |\n| Monoprice Steel Frame Computer Desk | Stationary | 48\" x 24\" | 220 lbs | None | 1 year |\nHow we test desks\nTesting desks is something of a subjective game. Much like office chairs, the tests are based on comfort, reliability and ease of setup rather than things you can test in electronics such as wattage and battery usage. I still tested each one rigorously and will continue to test them for longevity in the coming months.\nI tested these desks by asking three people to try each one. Each of them used the desk for at least 16 hours and then gave me their impressions. The three people were 6 feet, 1 inch tall; 5 feet, 8 inches tall; and 5 feet, 4 inches tall respectively, to give me a good cross-section of average user height.\nSetup time and package quality\nBuilding desks can often be difficult and time-consuming. For each desk, I timed how long it took to unpack and assemble, and I noted whether the manual was easy to follow. I followed the instructions as closely as possible so that each build was performed as if I had never built one before. I also thoroughly checked the packaging, to make sure it wasn't damaged, and if it was secure enough to carry the desk it had in it. Any damage was noted, and images were sent to the manufacturers for review.\nStructural integrity\nModern desks need to be able to hold a good amount of weight. If you're at a writing desk you might only have a small laptop, but if you're using a gaming desk, it likely has two monitors and a giant gaming PC as well. For each desk, I checked the maximum load specification, and I tried to match that with the materials we actually use on our desks.\nI used:\n- A heavy gaming PC tower\n- Two 27-inch gaming monitors on a dual monitor arm\n- A MacBook Pro\n- Two different keyboards and assorted mice and trackpads\n- My Oculus Quest 2\n- My phone stand and USB hub\n- A podcasting mic and headphones\nDepending on the length and weight capacity of the desk, I mix and match these items, then check for any bowing of the top or inconsistencies in how the desk felt as I worked.\nThe wibble-wobbles\nThis is a bit of a throwback from when my dad used to make furniture. Anything my dad built would be critiqued by my mum, and if it didn't pass muster, she would say, \"It's a bit wibbly-wobbly, isn't it, dear?\" Once I've built each desk and loaded it for normal use, I would check it for the wibble-wobbles. This means rocking it from side to side and forward and backward to check that all the screws, bolts and fixtures kept everything rigid.\nBest desk FAQs\nHow do I find the best desk for me?\nWhen looking into desks, there are a few things to consider. One of the most important is the space you will be putting the desk in, making sure it is a good size for the room and you have a good space in your home for it. You will also want to make sure the desktop size matches with how you plan to use the desk, as a small desk won't handle multiple monitors.\nHow tall should my desk be?\nWhether it's a traditional desk or a standing desk, you'll always want to have your desk at the same height as your elbows, so the perfect height varies from person to person. This will make sure your desk is ergonomic and help you fix your posture."

      "text": "A good desk setup needs a good keyboard. Whether your desk is designated for work from home, gaming or both, a good keyboard good keyboard is essential. The issue is that there are a ton of keyboards on the market, so picking one for your needs can be tricky. That's why we've gone through the top options on the market and tested a bunch of keyboards to find the best ones for you. Big brands like Logitech, Apple and Microsoft offer plenty of great choices, but smaller brands have some pretty high-quality options as well. You'll find some worthwhile picks from them on this list too.\nOur Picks\nFor this list, we've mostly focused on productivity-focused keyboards for those long days in your home office, compact keyboards for a model that works well in a tiny dorm room and budget keyboards. We've compiled a list of the best keyboard options so that you don't have to search yourself.\nIn this list, we've included wired and wireless keyboards designed for work and everyday use, with a variety of models at different price points. We have a dedicated guide for the best gaming keyboards we've tested.\nAlso, unlike phones, TVs, laptops and many other tech products, keyboards aren't updated frequently. There's a good chance the best keyboard for you may be a model that's been around for a while. The market is huge, though, with a variety of keyboard features available like weighted keys or a wrist rest, and we'll continue to test new models and update this list so that you can find the best keyboard overall for your needs.\nLogitech's MX Keys is one of our favorite everyday Bluetooth keyboards and now it comes in two smaller versions that leave off the number pad and some other keys: MX Keys Mini and MX Keys Mini for Mac. It comes in rose, pale gray and graphite.\nWe feel the smaller version is better for most people than the full-size MX Keys. It takes up less space on your desk and it's ergonomically better because it allows you to keep your mouse closer to your keyboard, which means less reaching and improved shoulder alignment. The Mini also has three new keys, giving you shortcuts to dictation (available in select countries for Windows and MacOS users), emojis and the all-important muting and unmuting of your microphone for video conference calls.\nPros\n- The Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad has light, bouncy keys that are great to type with. The new number pad makes it easier to input figures or work with some creative software shortcuts. It pairs easily and lasts a long time between charges.\nCons\n- The flat design can put strain on your wrist. The lack of backlight makes it harder to work with the keys at night.\nThe old-school Mac keyboard and its pleasing scissor-key mechanism is the keyboard to have for most Mac users. It's a Bluetooth keyboard that connects to MacOS instantly, and a charge of its built-in battery lasts for many months. This standard keyboard is slim, minimal and matches Apple's hardware perfectly. And it's available without the numeric keypad, too.\nIf your office has reopened but you're not going to be using the same workspace every day, the K3 Bluetooth keyboard is a fantastic option. The slim, compact mechanical keyboard is a 75% size, meaning it doesn't have a 10-key number pad but still has function and directional keys. The body, which is made from aluminum on top and a plastic on the bottom, is lightweight and sturdy.\nThe compact keyboard is available with Keychron's own low-profile optical mechanical switches -- brown tactile, blue clicky or red linear -- with a white LED backlight or Gateron low-profile mechanical switches with an RGB backlight. I tested all of the Keychron switches and preferred the blue switches for their crisp sound and feel but all three options worked well. Also, if you go with the Keychron switch version, the switches are hot-swappable, which lets you customize your typing experience simply by pulling out and replacing the switches without any soldering. (A hot-swappable version with an RGB backlight will be available soon.)\nOut of the box, it is set up for Mac use, but Windows-related keycaps are in the box, too. A switch on the back left lets you pick between MacOS/iOS or Windows/Android. Another switch lets you toggle between using Bluetooth (it can connect to up to three devices) or a USB-C-to-USB-A cable. Battery life is good, but keeping the backlight on all the time, especially at its higher settings, will drain it fast.\nA good alternative to the Apple Magic Keyboard with the number pad, this two-zone version of Satechi's slim wireless keyboard saves some desk by jettisoning some of the directional keys. You still get arrow keys, though, and a full number pad. The feel is similar to the Magic Keyboard, too, with a bit more travel and it has a Mac keyboard layout so you get all the shortcut keys in the Function key row. (It'll work with Windows PCs too and can be connected to up to three other Bluetooth devices.) It's backlit around the keys, which is something you don't get from Apple at this price. It will run down your battery so you probably don't want to use it all the time. It charges via a USB-C connector on the back and can be used wired if you want to keep working while it juices up.\nThough it doesn't match the comfort of the Zergotech Freedom, the K860 is a compact, one-piece split, curved, ergonomic keyboard. It's not unlike others such as the Microsoft Sculpt, but it's not bulky, clunky or unsightly -- or in need of add-ons. It also gives Logitech a full desk setup of ergonomic devices when paired with its MX Vertical mouse or MX Ergo trackball mouse.\nDespite the low-profile design, there's plenty of key travel and a pleasing, responsive bounce. This compact keyboard is not backlit, but the gray keys and white markings have enough contrast that they're visible in low-light conditions, just not in complete darkness. Powered by two AA-size batteries, the K860 can connect to your computer via Bluetooth or Logitech's USB-A Unifying receiver, which makes it a good option if you need one keyboard that can quickly switch between computers, phones or tablets.\nAs far as easy use with multiple devices goes, the K780 continues to be one of the best. Larger than the company's Bluetooth K380 Multi-Device Keyboard, the K780 can connect over Bluetooth or with a wireless USB receiver. The K780 also adds a number pad and -- more importantly -- a slot at the back of the keyboard to hold your tablet or phone while you type.\nThe keyboard also supports Logitech's Flow software feature. When this wireless keyboard is paired with one of the company's Flow-enabled mice, you can move your cursor between paired devices on the same network and the keyboard will follow. It's like having a virtual KVM switch.\nFor travel, the K380 would be the way to go, but the K780 is the better choice if you're sliding between a phone, tablet and a computer at home or the office.\nThe BK10 is a Bluetooth keyboard that can be connected to up to three devices and lets you quickly switch between connections with keys above its numeric keypad. What's better is the keyboard is set up to work with Windows, MacOS, iOS/iPadOS and Android devices.\nIt has a slim, lightweight body with matte-finished stainless steel on the top and sides and ABS plastic on the bottom. It's available in other finishes, too. The keyboard's scissor keys give it a responsive key feel, and it will last for up to three months on a single charge.\nWhile it's a full keyboard with a number pad, it's set up more like a laptop keyboard with half-height up and down arrow keys squeezed between two full-size left and right arrow keys tucked below the right Shift key. It's essentially the same size and layout as Apple's smaller Magic Keyboard, but with a number pad. One potentially frustrating difference, though: The left-hand Control and Function keys are flipped in position. Otherwise, this is a great pick if you're in need of a budget-friendly option for your MacOS and iOS devices, your Windows and Android devices or a mix of them all.\nLarge, wired and designed primarily for Windows users, this is the overstuffed recliner of ergonomic keyboards. It's more affordable than most ergo models, although it's a full-size keyboard and requires a good bit of desk space. You're probably better off keeping this on an under-mount keyboard tray and your mouse on your desktop.\nLike most ergonomic keyboards, this one takes a little time to adjust to -- partly because of the split keyboard design but also due to its high actuation force. It is comfortable, though, and an attachable lift at the front puts your hands at a negative angle for better positioning.\nThere are three programmable hotkeys at the top left, followed to the right by a row of media controls and quick-launch buttons for the calculator, screen snips, TaskView to see your open windows, system lock and search. It even has a shortcut button for symbols and emoji."

      "text": "I review all types of laptops at CNET, from budget models for everyday tasks to high-performance laptops for PC gaming and content creation -- and everything in between. With decades of experience, I conduct rigorous performance tests and supplement the benchmarks with extensive hands-on use to get a sense of a laptop's design and features in addition to its performance. And I always keep price and value in mind when evaluating a laptop. I have favorite MacBooks and I also have many Windows laptops to recommend for a variety of uses. No matter your budget or whether you need a laptop for home, school or work, I'm confident there's a laptop here that's perfect for you. Let's dive in.\nOur Picks\nLAPTOP DEALS OF THE WEEK\nWhat is the best laptop overall?\nApple\u2019s already fantastic laptop is now faster and cheaper. The MacBook Air recently received a jolt with an update to Apple\u2019s latest M4 silicon and its price dropped by $100. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 starts at $999 and the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 starts at $1,199. Each provides a ton of value for the money. The larger Air is still thin and light while supplying a roomy 15.3-inch display. It\u2019s the best laptop for most people. The smaller and lighter Air sacrifices some screen size for increased portability, making it the best student laptop.\nA Windows rival to the MacBook Air has arrived in the form of Microsoft's first Copilot Plus PC. Based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon X CPU, the Surface Laptop 7 offers strong application and AI performance and outstanding battery life. It was the first Windows laptop I've tested with a longer battery life than that of the MacBook Air. With a design that's on par with the Air's, the Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best laptops. So is the Asus Zenbook A14, which is a lightweight laptop with an even longer battery life than the Surface Laptop 7.\nRead more:\nBest laptops of 2025\nPros\n- Optimal balance of screen size and system weight\n- M4 processor provides good balance of performance and battery life\n- Lower $1,199 starting price\nCons\n- 256GB SSD is too small for the price\n- $200 upcharge for more RAM or storage is steep\n- Smooth ProMotion display still exclusive to MacBook Pro\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air is proof that you don't need a Pro to get a larger display. It supplies a larger screen that you once found only on the pricier Pro models. If you're eyeing the 14- or 16-inch Pro models primarily for the added screen size, the MacBook Air 15 is the more affordable option you should go for, especially at its new lower starting price.\nWhy we like it\nI really enjoyed the roomy, 15.3-inch display. It made juggling multiple windows during the workday easier, and I liked watching show, movies and baseball on it in the evenings.The Apple M4 update adds incremental improvements -- and a new sky blue color -- to an already fantastic laptop that sits in the Goldilocks Zone of Apple's MacBook lineup.\nWho it's best for\nPeople looking for a big-screen MacBook who don't need the power of a MacBook Pro. With its roomy display, trim design and new lower starting price, the 15-inch M4 MacBook Air should be viewed as the default Air, with its cheaper and smaller 13-inch sibling a good alternative for students and others with tighter budgets and busy, on-the-go lifestyles.\nWho shouldn't get it\nStudents who need a more affordable and portable laptop will be better off with the 13-inch Air. Creative types who need more graphics oomph will need to spend more for the added power of a MacBook Pro. Check out our best MacBooks page for more MacBook recommendations.\nPros\n- Big performance gains from M1, Intel MacBook Airs\n- Great design, features\n- Support for two external displays simultaneously with MacBook display\n- 12-megapixel Center Stage camera\nCons\n- 256GB SSD might fill up fast\n- Expensive upgrades\nFor Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air, the bigger news than moving from Apple's M3 silicon to M4 chips is the drop in price.\nWhy we like it\nStarting at $999, the MacBook M4 Air is $100 cheaper than the entry point for the previous M3 models. In addition to a slight bump in performance over the previous generation, the M4 Air adds a Center Stage webcam, better support for external displays and a new ice blue color option.\nWho it's best for\nStudents and anyone looking for the most affordable and portable MacBook. My colleague, Josh Goldman, tested it and found that the M4 chip refresh adds up to a good, if minor, update to an already fantastic lightweight laptop that\u2019s now more affordable for students and those on tight budgets. With its mix of strong overall performance, long battery life and a trim design, it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s such a popular laptop for students.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who is buying a MacBook Air for toting around the house instead across campus will enjoy the roomier display of the 15-inch Air. Also, graphics pros who need the power of a Pro will need to spend more for a 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nPros\n- Beautiful, durable design\n- Class-leading battery life\n- Strong performance\n- Awesome and accurate haptic touchpad\nCons\n- No OLED option\n- Upgrades get costly and don't include dedicated GPU\n- Your Arm-on-Windows compatibility mileage may vary\nThe Surface Laptop 7 reverses earlier Arm-based efforts that were plagued by lackluster performance and limited compatibility. Many x86 apps were unable to run on an Arm-based system. This time around, performance has improved and so has compatibility.\nWhy we like it\nI like it for its polished design and class-leading battery life. The Surface Laptop 7 ran for nearly 20 hours in testing -- that\u2019s the longest of any 13- or 14-inch laptop I've ever tested -- including the M4 MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop 7 competes with the MacBook Air in performance and battery life and supplies a similarly sleek and solid build.\nWho it's best for\nPeople who love the look and long battery life of the MacBook Air but want a Windows laptop. We wish there were an OLED display option, and you\u2019ll need to do a compatibility check for your mission-critical applications before embracing the Arm-based Surface Laptop 7, but if you can get past those hurdles, then you\u2019ll get a well-built, good-looking and long-running Windows ultraportable. You don't necessarily need to spend the roughly $2,000 that our test system costs; one of the lower-priced configurations that starts at $900 should meet the needs of most people.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone worried about potential Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues should skip Qualcomm-based laptops and pick out an Intel or AMD model. The Surface Laptop 7 is also not the pick if you want an OLED display on your next laptop. For more, check out my other favorite Windows laptops.\nPros\n- Incredibly thin and light without feeling flimsy\n- All-day-and-all-night battery life\n- OLED display at this price is a nice surprise\n- Ample RAM and storage for the price too\nCons\n- Meh performance from Snapdragon X CPU\n- Meh mechanical touchpad\n- Meh speakers\nBuilt around an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor, the Zenbook A14 is the lightest Copilot Plus PC I've tested and the second-longest running. It weighs less than 2.2 pounds and offers a battery life of more than 24 hours.\nWhy we like it\nI was hugely impressed with the Ceraluminum shell that allows the Zenbook A14 to be incredibly light yet rigid, and its 14-inch OLED display is excellent. It also serves up ample RAM and storage for the price.\nWho it's best for\nStudents and anyone who is on the road with regularity for their job. If portability is paramount, then the lightweight, long-running Zenbook A14 is the pick.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are concerned about Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues, then you should skip the Zenbook A14 and find an Intel- or AMD-based laptop. I have other best lightweight laptop picks.\nBest budget laptop\nAcer Aspire 14 AI\nPros\n- Exceedingly long battery life\n- Competitive performance for the price\n- Useful port selection\nCons\n- Dull display\n- Dull design\nThis recent release from Acer's budget Aspire line is based on an Intel Lunar Lake CPU. Its Intel Core Ultra 5 226V has a neural processing unit capable of 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS) for local AI processing, which happens to be the minimum requirement for Microsoft's Copilot Plus PC platform. The Aspire 14 AI is on sale for just $500 at Amazon, making it easily the cheapest Copilot Plus PC I've reviewed.\nWhy we like it\nThe Aspire 14 AI is a great pick among budget laptops. Its performance and battery life exceed what I expected for the price, and the design is nearly the same as I've seen from Acer's more expensive Swift models. You're forced to sacrifice display quality to hit such a low price but that's an item that's usually not very high on a budget shopper's priority list. More important is getting a modern CPU that delivers sufficient performance for everyday use that's also efficient to allow for lengthy battery life -- plus a bit of future-proofing with its AI capabilities.\nWho it's best for\nBudget laptop shoppers. With the lengthy battery life we've come to expect from Copilot Plus PCs and with application and AI performance that's competitive with pricier models, the Aspire 14 AI offers great value for budget buyers looking for a Copilot Plus PC. For more, check out my other best budget laptop picks.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you care about the overall look of your next laptop and have the money, you can find more exciting designs. Spending more will also get you a brighter display with better color performance.\nPros\n- Strong build quality\n- Great performance for the price\n- Long battery life\n- Comfortable, quiet keyboard\n- Good port selection\nCons\n- A little on the heavy side\n- Clacky touchpad\n- Uninspired audio output\nWith its excellent build quality, adequate display, strong performance and lengthy battery life, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 provides a ton of value and is a great fit as a versatile machine for home use or students.\nWhy we like it\nIt's a great deal at its price of $900 at Best Buy and an even better deal at its regularly discounted price of $800 direct from Lenovo. We like its solid, all-metal chassis and the power and efficiency you get from its AMD Ryzen 7 8000-series CPU.\nWho it's best for\nAnyone looking for a flexible two-in-one for a great price, including students who might like to take notes in tablet mode. It lacks some of the refinement and extras you get with Lenovo\u2019s flagship Yoga 9i 14, but the midrange Yoga 7 14 is much more affordable. We think it's the better option for most people.\nWho shouldn't get it\nLaptop buyers who want a lighter two-in-one with a better OLED display and better speakers -- and are willing to spend more to get those extras -- should instead consider the Yoga 9i 14. For more, check out my picks for the best two-in-one laptop.\nBest gaming laptop\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G16\nPros\n- Excellent fast, calibrated OLED screen\n- Well designed\n- Performance vs. size reasonably balanced\n- Good port selection\nCons\n- Battery life is just okay\n- Big power brick\n- Bottom and hinge areas can get hot\n- Settings in Armoury Crate software can get confusing\nThe Zephyrus G16 that my colleague, Lori Grunin, reviewed is relatively pricey at $2,700 for an upscale configuration with a 16-inch OLED screen, RTX 4080, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H.\nWhy we like it\nThe ROG G16 configuration that Lori tested isn't cheap but it's a good all-around system for both gaming and creative work. She liked the huge, calibrated OLED display and performance from the pairing of the Core Ultra 9 CPU and RTX 4080 graphics. The port selection was also a positive.\nWho it's best for\nGamers who want a large screen for a more immersive gaming experience, and creators who will make use of the calibrated OLED display. Solid configurations start at $2,000, so you don't need to spend as much as the model we reviewed. If you have a smaller budget, then take a peek at our picks for best cheap gaming laptop.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Zephyrus G16 is a great choice for gamers, but its little sibling -- the G14 -- is a little more highly rated because of its more general-use advantages, which include size, weight and lower price.\nPros\n- Excellent 2.8K OLED display\n- Beautiful design that's also compact and lightweight\n- Competitive application and AI performance from Intel Lunar Lake CPU\nCons\n- Very expensive when not on sale\n- Battery life is good but not great\nIf you love the sleek look and great portability of a MacBook Air but need a Windows laptop for work, then HP's flagship EliteBook Ultra is a great alternative.\nWhy we like it\nWith a spectacular 14-inch, 2.8K OLED display wrapped up in an elegant and compact enclosure, the EliteBook Ultra G1i deserves its Ultra label. It definitely has a premium look and feel that I found was on par with a MacBook Air in terms of being thin and light yet rigid and sturdy. In my tests, the Intel Lunar Lake CPU proved to be a well-rounded performer with great efficiency for good battery life that'll get you through almost any work day on a single charge.\nWho it's best for\nWith its compact chassis and deluxe design, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is well suited for traveling executives or anyone who appreciates a small, lightweight OLED laptop for work.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who can't wait for it to go on sale or isn't purchasing at a quantity that qualifies for a volume-pricing discount should take a pass. At its sale price of $1,899 or $1,999, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is an excellent value and a great choice for your next work laptop, but it's harder to recommend at its full price of nearly $3,000. If you're buying a laptop for work, then I'd point you to my list of best business laptops for more recommendations.\nBest Chromebook\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514\nPros\n- Long battery life\n- Excellent webcam performance\n- Bright, matte touchscreen\n- Durable build\n- 512GB SSD\nCons\n- No keyboard backlight\n- Lots of flex on the keyboard, touchpad\n- Slower 5Gbps USB-C ports\nWhy we like it\nThis new Chromebook Plus model delivers good performance and even better battery life along with a respectably bright display with a matte finish to limit glare. It has more storage than you'd typically find at its price. The model we reviewed lacked keyboard backlighting, which was a bit of a bummer, but Acer does sell models with a backlit keyboard that aren\u2019t that much more expensive.\nWho it's best for\nStudents and anyone looking for a Chromebook for a home office or secondary entertainment machine. It's a fixed configuration based on an Intel Core i3-N305 CPU and 8GB of RAM. Those specs might seem underpowered but suffice for ChromeOS, which is much more lightweight than Windows. With its mix of features and performance for the price, it\u2019s easy to recommend for school, work or home.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you need to run a specific Windows or MacOS application, then you'll need to skip a low-cost Chromebook and choose a budget Windows laptop or MacBook Air -- we have recommendations.\nBest laptops compared\nSee the pricing and specs for our favorite laptops.\n| Starting price | Display size/resolution | Weight | CPU tested | GPU tested | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Apple MacBook Air 15 (M4, 2025) | $1,199 | 15.3-inch, 2,880x1,864 | 3.3 pounds | Apple M4 10\u2011core CPU | Apple M4 10\u2011core GPU |\n| Apple MacBook Air 13 (M4, 2025) | $999 | 13.6-inch, 2,560x1,664 | 2.7 pounds | Apple M4 10\u2011core CPU | Apple M4 8\u2011core GPU |\n| Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 | $1,000 | 13.8-inch, 2,304x1,536 | 2.96 pounds | Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100 | Qualcomm Adreno |\n| Asus Zenbook A14 | $1,100 | 14-inch, 1,920x1,200 OLED | 2.16 pounds | Qualcomm Snapdragon X X1-26-100 | Qualcomm Adreno |\n| Acer Aspire 14 AI | $750 | 14-inch, 1,920x1,200 | 3.05 pounds | Intel Core Ultra 5 226V | Intel Arc 130V |\n| Lenovo Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 | $900 | 14-inch, 1,920x1,200 | 3.6 pounds | AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS | AMD Radeon 780M |\n| Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 | $2,700 | 16-inch, 2,560x1,600 OLED | 4.3 pounds | Intel Core Ultra 9 185H | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 |\n| HP EliteBook Ultra G1i | $1,999 | 14-inch 2,880x1,800 OLED | 2.6 pounds | Intel Core Ultra 7 268V | Intel Arc 140V |\n| Acer Chromebook Plus 514 | $350 | 14-inch, 1,920x1,080 | 3.2 pounds | Intel Core i3-N305 | Intel UHD |\nMost recent additions\nThe HP EliteBook Ultra G1i is the most recent addition to the list. With its trim design, excellent build quality and high-res OLED display, it's our pick for the best business laptop.\nThe new M4 versions of the MacBook Airs are the next-newest additions. The 15-inch Air acts as the bridge between the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 and MacBook Pro line and offers fans the best of both worlds: a larger display without the MacBook Pro premium. Because Apple has dropped the price by $100 for the M4 MacBook Air models, the price gap between the Air and Pro has grown.\nOther laptops we've tested\nHP OmniBook X Flip 16: While it has a handful of appealing features, this midrange 16-inch convertible ends up being a clumsy assemblage of disparate parts.\nLenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition: It offers a cheap path to an OLED ultraportable, but is a ThinkPad a ThinkPad without the little red nub in the middle of the keyboard?\nHP OmniBook X Flip 14: This two-in-one laptop offers style, value and configuration options abound, including a 3K OLED display for only an extra $100.\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13-inch): It\u2019s compact, solidly built and great for travel, but the 13.8-inch version is the better choice as your daily driver.\nDell 14 Plus: Skip the two-in-one and opt for the clamshell laptop I tested, when it goes on sale.\nAcer Swift Go 16 (2025): Built around a beautiful 16-inch OLED screen, the latest Swift Go 16 improves on its predecessors without significant price inflation.\nDell 16 Plus 2-in-1: This big-screen, mini-LED convertible laptop certainly has some positives, but there are a few too many negatives to give this Plus a full-throated recommendation.\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition: It\u2019s a great business laptop, but it can get pricey fast with upgrades.\nAcer Swift 14 AI: This midrange Copilot Plus PC offers incredible battery life but is missing one key feature.\nHP EliteBook X G1a: X does not mark the spot for this biz laptop when the Ultra version costs roughly the same and supplies a far better display inside a slimmer, more compact design.\nLenovo Yoga Slim 9i 14 Gen 10: It's ultrastylish and ultracompact, but maybe don't hide the camera behind the display next time?\nAcer Chromebook Plus 516: The 16-inch display provides plenty of room to work but Acer has a similar model that offers more for less.\nHP Pavilion Plus 14 (2025): Parts of the HP Pavilion Plus 14 are great but there's one poor-quality feature that totally ruins the experience.\nAcer Swift 16 AI: It's thin. It's light. It's long-running. And it boasts a big, bright 16-inch OLED display. So what's holding this Copilot Plus PC back from being more than just a big-screen productivity machine?\nHow we test laptops\nThe review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.\nWe test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, including Primate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6, Cinebench R23, PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark benchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported) and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for PC gaming, we'll also run benchmarks from Guardians of the Galaxy, The Rift Breaker (CPU and GPU) and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\nFor the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.\nThe list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our How We Test Computers page.\nBest time to buy a laptop\nAmazon Prime Day is a great time to find a laptop at a great price, and you might be able to nab some remaining Prime Day deals from last week's big event.\nOther times of the year when you can find the best laptop deals are during back-to-school sales in late summer or early fall and a bit later in the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. You can find discounts on laptops throughout the year but, if you're looking for the best deal and can afford to wait, these are typically the best times to buy one.\nBest laptop brands\nApple\u2019s MacBooks are the most popular laptops and for good reason. They offer excellent build quality and leading performance and battery life ever since Apple introduced its M series processors in 2020.\nThe top two brands on the Windows side are Lenovo and HP. Both offer a wide variety of models, from thin-and-light ultraportables to larger, more powerful models for gaming content creation. Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPads have long been a favorite among business laptops and its Yoga models are usually highly rated two-in-one laptops.\nHP is in the middle of a branding transformation. It's ended its Pavilion, Envy and Spectre laptop brands in favor of OmniBook consumer models and EliteBook business models. Its Omen brand will continue as the home for its gaming laptops. I liked the first OmniBook laptop I reviewed and look forward to testing more.\nFor a budget laptop, Acer and Apple have great options -- each dominates our best budget laptop list. Acer makes great low-cost laptops and budget gaming laptops and Apple's MacBook Air can usually be found for less than $1,000 where it's a great deal. And the older M1 model costs even less.\nFactors to consider when shopping the best laptops\nThere are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. To help simplify things for you, here are the main things you should consider when you start looking.\nPrice\nThe search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics that chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you'll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it. That stands whether you're spending $500 or more than $1,000. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it's best to get as much laptop as you can afford from the start.\nGenerally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I'd love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that's not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800 and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capabilities for less.\nOperating system\nChoosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things (except for gaming, where Windows is the winner), but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. If you're not sure which that is, head to an Apple store or a local electronics store and test them out. Or ask friends or family to let you test theirs for a bit. If you have an iPhone or iPad and like it, chances are you'll like MacOS, too.\nIn price and variety (and PC gaming), Windows laptops win. If you want MacOS, you're getting a MacBook. Apple's MacBooks regularly top our best lists, the least expensive one is the M1 MacBook Air for $999. It is regularly discounted to $750 or $800, but if you want a cheaper MacBook, you'll have to consider older refurbished ones.\nWindows laptops can be found for as little as a couple of hundred dollars and come in all manner of sizes and designs. Granted, we'd be hard-pressed to find a $200 laptop we'd give a full-throated recommendation to but if you need a laptop for online shopping, email and word processing, they exist.\nIf you are on a tight budget, consider a Chromebook. ChromeOS is a different experience than Windows; make sure the applications you need have a Chrome, Android or Linux app before making the leap. If you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or using cloud-gaming services, they're a good fit.\nSize\nRemember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Size is primarily determined by the screen -- hello, laws of physics -- which in turn factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. Keep in mind other physics-related characteristics, such as an ultrathin laptop isn't necessarily lighter than a thick one, you can't expect a wide array of connections on a small or ultrathin model and so on.\nScreen\nWhen deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: How much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether you'll be using it for gaming or creative work.\nYou really want to optimize pixel density; that is, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Although other factors contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means a sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen at DPI Calculator if you don't feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) I recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb.\nBecause of the way Windows and MacOS scale for the display, you're frequently better off with a higher resolution than you'd think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill but may not be if you need to, say, view a wide spreadsheet.\nIf you need a laptop with relatively accurate color that displays the most colors possible or that supports HDR, you can't simply trust the specs -- not because manufacturers lie, but because they usually fail to provide the necessary context to understand what the specs they quote mean. You can find a ton of detail about considerations for different types of screen uses in our monitor buying guides for general purpose monitors, creators, gamers and HDR viewing.\nProcessor\nThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with its Arm-based Snapdragon X processors. Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head to Intel's or AMD's sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.\nApple makes its own chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. Like Intel and AMD, you'll still want to pay attention to the naming conventions to know what kind of performance to expect. Apple uses its M-series chipsets in Macs. The entry-level MacBook Air uses an M1 chip with an eight-core CPU and seven-core GPU. The current models have M2-series silicon that starts with an eight-core CPU and 10-core GPU and goes up to the M2 Max with a 12-core CPU and a 38-core GPU. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance.\nBattery life has less to do with the number of cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple\u2019s Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-based Copilot Plus PCs we\u2019ve tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD.\nGraphics\nThe graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU.\nBecause the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU.\nFor more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs.\nMemory\nFor memory, I highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded.\nSome PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop's full specs online to confirm. Check the web for user experiences because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls.\nStorage\nYou'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives; if the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working.\nGet what you can afford and if you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive or two down the road or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: I don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game.\nFrequently asked questions\nHow much money should I spend on a laptop?\nJudging from the current selections on our list, I recommend spending $600 or more for a midrange laptop and at least $1,000 and probably closer to $2,000 on a gaming laptop. We\u2019ve already seen price hikes on many laptop models since the Trump tariffs began earlier this year. Acer's Jason Chen said in February that the company would raise its prices by 10% in anticipation. \"We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff,\" the CEO of the Taiwan-based company said.\nThe Trump administration has eased up somewhat on its tariffs against China, dropping the overall rates from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while trade negotiations continue. While this temporary cut may help prevent further price increases, I haven\u2019t seen any price reductions outside of sales. And if you are patient, you can usually find the model you want on sale. Laptop vendors and online retailers are constantly rotating sales so it pays to keep an eye on pricing and buy during a dip. During the summer, check out laptop sales for dads and grads and then back-to-school sales.\nWhich is better: MacOS or Windows?\nDeciding between MacOS and Windows laptops for many people will come down to personal preference and budget. Apple's base model laptop, the M1 MacBook Air, starts at $999. You can sometimes find it discounted or you can get educational pricing from Apple and other retailers. In general, it'll be at least $1,000 for a new MacBook and the prices just go up from there.\nFor the money, you're getting great hardware top to bottom, inside and out. Apple recently moved to using its own processors, which resulted in across-the-board performance improvements compared to older Intel-based models. The company's most powerful laptop, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, still hasn't been updated to Apple silicon.\nAgain, that great hardware comes at a price. Also, you're limited to just Apple laptops. With Windows and Chromebooks (more on these below), you get an amazing variety of devices at a range of prices.\nSoftware between the two is plentiful so unless you need to run something that's only available on one platform or the other, you should be fine to go with either. Gaming is definitely an advantage for a Windows laptop.\nMacOS is also considered to be easier and safer to use than Windows, especially for people who want their computers to get out of the way so they can get things done. Over the years, Microsoft has done its best to follow suit and, with Windows 11 here, it's trying to remove any barriers. Also, while Macs might have a reputation for being safer, with the popularity of the iPhone and iPad helping to drive Mac sales, they've become bigger targets for malware.\nAre there any laptop accessories I might need?\nIf you plan to travel with your laptop, whether across campus or the country, a good laptop backpack is essential. There are a lot of subpar backpacks out there, so check our best laptop backpacks list for our recommendations based on hours and hours of testing.\nAnd for when you aren\u2019t on the move but at your desk and ready to work, a laptop cooling pad can help your laptop run smoothly. From gaming and video editing to just having dozens of Chrome tabs open, there are times when your laptop needs some help to stay cool and maintain full performance. Our sister site ZDNet has a good list of the best laptop cooling pads.\nAre Chromebooks worth it?\nYes, they are, but they're not for everyone. Google's Chrome OS has come a long way in the 10-plus years since they arrived and Chromebooks -- laptops that run on Chrome OS -- are great for people who do most of their work in a web browser or using mobile apps. They are secure, simple and, more often than not, a bargain. What they can't do is natively run Windows or Mac software."
