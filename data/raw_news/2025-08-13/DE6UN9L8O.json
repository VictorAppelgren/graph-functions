  "description": "Edge Hill University",
  "content": "Edge Hill (EHU) is our University of the Year for Student Experience. Outstanding results for student experience in this year's National Student Survey showed that students have woken up to the outstanding quality of the academic, social, sporting and residential environment to be found on their self-contained campus on the fringes of Liverpool. Heavy investment over the past decade has seen EHU transformed from an institution best known for teacher training into one of the most modern and vibrant universities in the UK with a diverse portfolio of courses. That it still appeals largely to a local audience in the North West is the rest of the country's loss and the North West's gain. Edge Hill is one of just 12 modern universities (those created since 1992) to have its own undergraduate medical school. It also has \u00a350m of newly opened academic, social and residential developments, and sets out one of the most joined-up approaches to making university accessible - and easy to succeed at - for all. The campus is leafy and green and has excellent sports and cultural facilities. It sits on the edge of Ormskirk, a small Lancashire town, and is a 36-minute train ride from Liverpool and its cultural, sporting and nighttime distractions. With highly competitive offers for places, Edge Hill is a bargain - providing high-quality education and outcomes for medium-tariff grades.\n\nAcademic, personal, creative and sporting excellence is rewarded at EHU, which also recognises outstanding citizenship. The accent on personal qualities rather than targeting students from low-income or non-traditional backgrounds is deliberate in a university with a highly social diverse student population. Everyone can benefit from student accommodation which is among the cheapest in the UK; the 2,600 residential places on campus are priced between \u00a33,600 and \u00a36,600 for a 40-week tenancy. All shows at the campus arts centre are free, there is free on-site parking and a shuttle bus between the campus and Ormskirk, a daily hot meal option for \u00a31.50, 100 laptops available to borrow, and scores of part-time jobs on campus for students. University departments make 35 academic achievement awards worth \u00a31,000 to the student with the highest average mark each year; Excellence scholarships of up to \u00a32,000 are made to reward determination, commitment and achievement beyond studies; a University scholarship is worth up to \u00a32,000 for students who raise Edge Hill's profile; and the Adam Bell scholarship is paid to students who make a significant contribution to the university community and who show compassion towards others. The Dame Janet Suzman Prize of \u00a31,000 is paid for writing an original script for stage, and the \u00a3500 Rhiannon Evans Poetry Award is made to students of promise and potential.\n\nThe new Life Sciences Building is the latest in a long line of campus infrastructure developments to give students access to the very latest facilities. The large 150-seat teaching laboratory will allow all students on bigger courses to be in the same room with their tutors rather than in separate laboratories linked by remote access. The new labs also contain extensive cell and tissue culture facilities that will uniquely allow students to carry out mammalian cell culture work on undergraduate degrees. A further unique bi-product of the new life sciences facilities is the new BSc global infectious disease degree, developed with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, which will recruit its first students in the 2025-26 admissions cycle. The new students' union building brings under one roof a place for students to go for information, advice and welfare support, together with space for live entertainment, sport and music, and food, drinks and retail outlets across three floors. New degrees in games development and cyber security are launched in September 2026, while teaching begins next on new degrees in chemistry, mathematics, physics, graphic design and economics.\n\nEHU has introduced Fair Entry Criteria this year to further bolster its reputation for making higher education accessible to students from all backgrounds. It formalises the previous ad hoc arrangements that successfully created one of the most socially diverse student populations in any universities. Offers will be reduced by up to two grades (16 Ucas tariff points) below the standard ask for students from homes in the 20% of postcodes considered to be the most deprived or from which the fewest go on to university. Applicants who have received free school meals also qualify, as do carers and those with experience of local authority care, estranged students and participants in the university's widening participation outreach programmes. While EHU expects around one third of students to be admitted with contextual offers, it told us it will continue to 'review applications on an individual basis and will use discretion in our offer making for students with mitigating circumstances'. EHU's Thrive programme provides a holistic package of support activities throughout the first year of study for students from under-represented groups. In addition to counselling and wellbeing support on campus and EHU's Let Us Know online reporting system for welfare concerns, all students have access to Edge Well 24/7, a round-the-clock support service providing immediate assistance from a qualified counsellor. Students can access the service via freephone, live chat or even request a call back at a convenient time. Personal tutors undergo training to ensure they provide timely support and intervention to students in distress and a Catalyst Helpdesk on campus triages queries from students on any issue.",
