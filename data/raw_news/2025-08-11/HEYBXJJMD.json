  "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on President Trump to accept a ceasefire in the fight over redrawing congressional lines, vowing Monday to make the GOP pay if Texas follows through on the president\u2019s plans.\n\nThe second week of the standoff began with dozens of Democratic Texas lawmakers still outside the state, denying the legislature the quorum it needs to take action.\n\nThe sides are dug in, but Mr. Newsom, a Democrat with White House ambitions in 2028, proposed an armistice with all sides backing away.\n\nHe has said his state will attempt to redraw its own lines to offset any GOP gains Texas may produce. But he said Monday he\u2019ll back away if Republicans do.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, if you do not stand down, we will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in [California] to offset the rigging of maps in red states. But if the other states call off their redistricting efforts we will do the same,\u201d the governor said on social media, adopting Mr. Trump\u2019s all-upper case writing style.\n\nHe closed by mimicking Mr. Trump\u2019s signature sign-off: \u201cThank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d\n\nMr. Newsom hosted some of the runaway Texas lawmakers last week as he seeks to ride the dust-up to national political prominence.\n\nIndeed, the issue is proving to be a bonanza for a number of politicians looking to raise their profile.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, seeking his party\u2019s nomination for Texas\u2019 U.S. Senate seat up for election next year, has been particularly active.\n\nHe has sued to ask his state\u2019s Supreme Court to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic lawmakers who fled to break quorum. And he won a restraining order over the weekend against former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Texas Democrat who was using his political organization to raise money to support the legislators\u2019 flight from the state.\n\nRedistricting \u2014 the process of drawing new legislative maps \u2014 usually only happens after the decennial census, though there is no federal prohibition on it happening in the middle of a decade.\n\nIndeed, New York, controlled by Democrats, redrew its lines last year, helping to capture three seats from Republicans in November\u2019s elections.\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Trump sparked the new fight by prodding Texas to follow New York\u2019s lead.\n\nThe Trump Justice Department sent a letter suggesting that a number of Texas districts drawn to give Black voters an overwhelming say in the outcome of elections may no longer be justified by the law. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has cited that letter as a prod for his actions.\n\nMr. Abbott has said he won\u2019t bow to the runaway Democrats.\n\nHe said he will call special sessions until the redistricting is complete, testing Democrats\u2019 resolve.\n\n\u201cIf they want to evade that arrest, they\u2019re going to stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years,\u201d the Republican told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d",

Newsom, a Democrat with White House ambitions in 2028, has stated that his state will attempt to redraw its own lines to offset any potential GOP gains.

The issue has been a major boost for Texas politicians, particularly Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has sued to remove the seats of 13 Democratic lawmakers who fled to break quorum. The Justice Department has suggested that some Texas districts drawn to give Black voters an overwhelming say in elections may no longer be justified by the law.",

The standoff continues as Texas Democrats remain outside the state to deny the legislature a quorum, while Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has taken legal action against those lawmakers. Newsom's proposal aims to de-escalate the situation, but he has indicated that California will retaliate if Texas moves forward with its redistricting efforts.",
