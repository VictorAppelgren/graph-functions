  "content": "The F1: The Movie has made a big splash at the box office at movie theaters around the world, and is now available to buy or rent at stores including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and more. The film is being distributed in partnership with Warner Bros. But as a fully financed Apple Original production, it will end up streaming on Apple TV+. Here\u2019s the expected streaming release date.\n\nApple has not officially announced further release plans yet, as the company is obviously currently focused on making the cinema run as successful as possible, and raking in some more money through video on demand channels.\n\nThe film has been a breakout theatrical hit, approaching $600 million at the worldwide box office. Typically, films that do well in theaters make a bigger splash when they hit streaming. In the meantime, Apple can use its cut of box office ticket sales and VOD purchases to offset the film\u2019s hefty production cost, estimated at $250m.\n\nAs such, Apple has not announced a streaming date yet.\n\nHowever, we can look at previous rollouts to get a good idea of the release date for streaming the movie at home. Studios generally stick to consistent release window periods for all their big releases.\n\nF1: The Movie premiered in theaters in the United States on June 27. Apple gave it a two month exclusivity in cinemas before debuting in the premium video-on-demand window.\n\nWe can then expect PVOD exclusivity will last for a month or two. After which, F1: The Movie will then stream on Apple TV+. This means people waiting to watch it home at no extra charge will likely be waiting until late September or October 2025 to stream it.\n\nThe exact release date depends ultimately on Apple, but the company is highly incentivised to get it out before Christmas and make a big streaming splash this winter on the service.\n\u2022 Apple TV+ shows and movies: Everything to watch on Apple TV Plus",

      "text": "Apple\u2019s F1: The Movie has exceeded all expectations at cinemas, with the film about to top $600 million at the worldwide box office since its premiere on June 27.\nFollowing its extended theatrical window, F1: The Movie is now available to buy or rent on-demand at digital stores like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and more.\nThis release follows the standard pricing pattern for what the industry calls the \u201cpremium video on-demand\u201d window, or PVOD. This means the film is available to rent for $20 or buy to own for $25.\nWhen the film finally leaves cinemas for good, the price will follow suit and fall to standard digital release pricing.\nThe digital release is in 2.39:1 aspect ratio. IMAX fanatics were hoping for a 1.90 ratio format; perhaps that will arrive in the future. The digital release includes iTunes Extras featuring about 45 minutes of bonus content material.\nOf course, Apple financed and produced the film which means it is set to become a flagship title on the Apple TV+ soon, where it will be available to stream at no additional charge for subscribers. But F1 still does not have an official streaming release date.\nBased on the pattern from Apple\u2019s previous theatrical movies, you can expect the PVOD window to be exclusive for a month or two. This would mean the F1 release date on Apple TV+ will likely be sometime in October or November (as predicted by us months ago).\nWhy does Apple wait so long to get the movie on TV+? There are few factors.\nFor one, cinemas usually demand a window of theatrical exclusivity so that their business is not undermined by a simultaneous streaming debut.\nSecondly, Warner Bros. is a partner on the distribution of the film, and they get a cut of box office and PVOD sales.\nThirdly, the film was very expensive to make \u2014 with budgets in the $200-300m range \u2014 and Apple wants to recoup as much of that cost too.\nWith a top-line box office takings of $600 million, Apple will keep about 40% of that. Incorporating marketing costs and profit from PVOD, Apple is on track to break even on the film, which essentially gives them a blockbuster title for Apple TV+ \u2018for free\u2019.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Apple TV+ costs $12.99 per month. Here\u2019s every Apple original television show and movie available now on Apple TV+, as well as the latest trailers \u2026\nApple TV+ content is available exclusively through the Apple TV app. You can watch on your Apple TV set-top box, iPhone, or iPad as you might expect.\nBut you don\u2019t need the latest Apple TV 4K to enjoy Apple TV+. The TV app is also available on other platforms like Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Sony PlayStation, Xbox, and even the web at tv.apple.com.\nApple TV+ offers original comedies, dramas, thrillers, documentaries, and kids shows.\nFor your $12.99/month subscription, you can watch all of Apple\u2019s originals \u2014 as listed below. You can download to watch offline too. Apple is adding new content every single month.\nHow to watch the free Apple TV+ shows\nThe TV app is the exclusive destination for Apple TV+, but the TV app is a little confusing because it blends together purchasable TV shows and movies from the iTunes Store, which you can buy or rent, content from other apps like Amazon Prime and Disney+, and Apple TV Channels.\nThe Watch Now screen does not really distinguish between content that you own and can watch, and just Apple\u2019s general recommendations.\nThe easiest way to get started with Apple TV+ is to open the Apple TV app on your device, and tap on the Apple TV+ tab.\nThis tab takes you to the Apple TV+ channel page. This shows you all of the Apple TV+ shows and movies available to watch, separated into categories like comedy, drama and family fun.\nBe aware, the web experience at tv.apple.com is a bit barebonds compared to the native TV app on devices, and it only shows Apple original content. For the best experience, use the TV app on a device like Apple TV 4K.\nWhat to watch on Apple TV+\nApple TV+ (Apple TV Plus, or as some erroneously call it Apple+ TV) is still in its infancy but has already seen breakout hits including comedy Ted Lasso and workplace sci-fi drama Severance.\nApple aims for premium quality across its drama, comedy, and documentary TV shows and movies so everything should reach a reasonable level of quality and hopefully be worth your time. In terms of personal recommendations, I suggest starting with Ted Lasso, For All Mankind, Severance, Presumed Innocent, and the movie Finch.\nRead on to see all of the TV shows, movies and specials streaming now on Apple TV+ as well as trailers for upcoming releases.\nAll Apple TV+ TV shows and movies (updated August 22, 2025):\nLatest Trailers\nDocuseries KPOPPED premieres August 29.\nDenzel Washington stars in Highest 2 Lowest, a new movie from Spike Lee.\nWatch season four of The Morning Show on September 17.
