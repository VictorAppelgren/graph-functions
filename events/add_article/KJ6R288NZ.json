      "summary": "The EU General Court upheld the Trans‑Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, ruling that the United States provided adequate protection for EU personal data and that the Data Protection Review Court is sufficiently independent. The decision allows US tech firms to continue storing EU users’ data on American servers while giving Europeans a formal complaint channel. French politician Philippe Latombe’s challenge was dismissed, though he may appeal to the EU Court of Justice. The ruling follows earlier EU court defeats of the Privacy Shield and signals a tentative path forward for trans‑Atlantic data flows.",
