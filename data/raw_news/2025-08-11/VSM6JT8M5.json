  "title": "Why Did Some WW2 Pilots Fly With The Canopy Open?",
  "description": "Ever notice WWII pilots flying with open canopies in old war films? They did it to avoid fumes, manage heat, and increase their chances of survival in combat.",
  "content": "The F-35 Lightning II, the primary fighter jet of the U.S. military and its allies, can scream through the sky at up to Mach 1.6, or 1,200 miles per hour. It is literally impossible for today's pilots to fly the most advanced aircraft the world has ever seen ... with its canopy wide open. Fighter pilots back in World War II, at what was really still the infancy of fighter plane design, didn't have that problem mainly because they weren't capable of attaining anywhere near the same airspeed as today's aircraft.\n\nMany of the experienced pilots at the start of WWII had earned their wings flying biplanes during the previous global battle (and never shot their own propellers), which were, by their very design, built with open cockpits. In 1914, the Royal Aircraft Factory built a single experimental S.E.4, which featured an optional molded celluloid cockpit cover. However, it was never used because the pilots were too wary of being confined within the plane's fuselage.\n\nGiven the mindset of these veteran pilots, most weren't too happy when canopies started becoming standard equipment. However, technological advances made these new and improved fighters exponentially faster and able to achieve higher altitudes, so pilots needed to wear masks that supplied them with supplemental oxygen to keep from passing out. These early planes didn't have air conditioning, and pilots were now sitting mere inches from massive heat-spewing engines while enclosed within a glass canopy, while the sun blasted them. At times, the heat was simply unbearable. Not only that, but early design flaws sometimes made it impossible to actually see through the canopy, so they would throw them open during flight.",

Many experienced pilots at the start of WWII, who had previously trained in biplanes with open cockpits, were unable to achieve the same airspeed as current aircraft due to design issues.

      "text": "How Did WW1 Planes Avoid Shooting Their Own Propellers?\nAerial combat is very complicated on its face, when you think about it. Two or more large metal husks basically have to defy gravity, while also attempting to fire weapons at each other. Accurately. Seems like it shouldn't be possible, right?\nWell, beyond the basic ideas of aerodynamics and maneuvering, planes in World War I had another pretty significant hurdle to clear: Actually shooting at each other. Sure, machine guns were commonplace at this point in history, and planes could and did mount lighter guns where they couldn't hit the props, but these weren't as accurate and couldn't accommodate heavier ordnance. A moving gun at the rear that could be fired by another person in the plane was also often used, but it couldn't fire toward the front of the plane.\nNo, the best spot for a heavier gun that would optimize accuracy and potential damage directed at targets in front of the plane was right behind the propeller. That intricately designed (and wooden) thing letting the plane move through the air. And pilots would have to shoot small bits of metal at very high velocities right through it.\nFinding the right gear\nAn early attempt to keep WWI fighter aircraft from blowing their own propellers to bits when firing was to simply add armor plating to the props, which did keep them from being shredded, but also ended up wasting the rounds that would inevitably hit that plating. So the simpler \u2014 and at the same time, more complicated \u2014 answer was to avoid hitting the propeller entirely. It all came down to timing via a specialized gear.\nThe idea had been kicking around for a while, but the Fokker synchronization gear arrived first, built into the German Air Service's Fokker Eindecker toward the end of 1915. It needed to be manually switched on for the pilot to shoot. As the propeller shaft spun, it would also rotate a cam wheel that was linked to the machine gun and timed the shots so they wouldn't hit the prop. Versions of the synchronization gear were rolled out in England and France in 1916.\nAll of these had problems. Wear and tear would sometimes cause the gun to stop working, or throw off the timing so that the bullets ended up hitting the propellers anyway. Then came the Constantinesco Fire Control Gear, aka the CC Gear, which incorporated hydraulics. A cam synced up with the propeller blade would move a plunger and cylinder, which created a \"wave motion\" connected to the trigger's motor. This ensured the gun would only fire between the propeller blades."

      "text": "Is The F-35 Really The Most Advanced Jet In The World & How Many Does The US Have?\nWhen a Messerschmitt Me 262 launched an attack on a British Havilland Mosquito over Munich during World War II, it made history as the first fighter jet to engage in combat. The technological advancements that came in the ensuing years would revolutionize air combat, making fighter jets an indispensable part of modern warfare.\nIf you're wondering how many fighter jets exist in the world today, the answer is nearly 15,000, with the United States having the largest active fleet. The U.S. Air Force operates several fighter jets, including the famous F-35.\nThe F-35, or the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II as it is formally known, entered service in 2015. It is powerful but stealthy, and can reach a speed of approximately Mach 1.6 (around 1,200 mph). But is the F-35 really the most advanced fighter jet in the world, or is this perception a result of media hype and defense industry dynamics? How many F-35 fighter jets does the U.S. have?\nWhat makes the F-35 so advanced?\nThe F-35 is equipped with some of the most sophisticated technology available today, starting with the ultra-precise Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. It also features the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), which enhances situational awareness, as well as the Electro Optical Targeting System (EOTS) for precision targeting, and a Helmet Mounted Display System (HMD) to help the pilot monitor critical information at all times.\nThe F-35 is a multipurpose fighter jet, which is arguably its biggest strength. It can be used for combat, surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance operations. This does not mean the Lightning II program is without its flaws \u2014 high production costs and delays have been cited as a major drawback.\nWhat is the bottom line, then? Is the F-35 the most advanced fighter jet in the world? It's difficult to answer this question definitively, but the F-35 is, without a doubt, one of the best fighter jets ever produced. It remains to be seen if Russia, China or other nations are capable of developing aircraft comparable to the F-35.\nHow many F-35 fighter jets does the U.S. have?\nHow many F-35 fighter jets does the U.S. have? As of 2024, the U.S. has over 600 F-35 fighter jets across all variants \u2014 the Air Force, Navy, and Marines use different versions of the F-35.\nIt should be noted, however, that there are plans to buy 1,800 more. The total cost of the F-35 program is now expected to exceed $2 trillion, as the aircraft's service life will be extended from 2077 to 2088.\nThe Department of Defense is working on upgrading the F-35, while at the same time trying to reduce costs. Issues with software stability have reportedly slowed down these efforts.\nOther countries around the world also have F-35s, but their fleets are much smaller. The Royal Australian Air Force, which has the second largest F-35 fleet, operates 63 aircraft. South Korea and Norway share the third place with 40, while Israel has 39 F-35 fighter jets. Japan, the Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, and the United Kingdom all use F-35s as well."
