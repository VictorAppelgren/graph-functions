  "description": "Dominance in cloud computing and artificial intelligence is propelling these two tech leaders.",
  "content": "\u2022 Apple has encountered several headwinds in recent years, making its mid-term prospects less attractive.\n\u2022 Both could perform far better than Apple through 2028.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a Let's get one thing out of the way: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is an excellent company. It boasts one of the most valuable brand names in the world, an army of loyal customers, and has consistently proven its innovative qualities over time. However, the tech leader has faced challenges lately, one of which is the threat of tariffs. Furthermore, Apple has fallen behind some of its similarly sized tech peers in the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI) market. The tailwind AI is providing to two of them, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), could enable both to surpass Apple in terms of market capitalization within the next three years. Here's why Amazon and Alphabet look like better buys right now. Amazon's current market cap is $2.4 billion, compared to Apple's $3.4 trillion. That sounds like a massive difference, but it's worth noting that Amazon has consistently grown its revenue faster than its peers over the past three years, despite having higher sales numbers. The e-commerce specialist should maintain that momentum for several reasons. First, it remains a leader in the cloud computing market. Even as it loses ground to some of its closest competitors, Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), remains a strong performer. The company's AWS sales in the second quarter increased by 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion, outpacing the rest of the business. AWS is also responsible for most of Amazon's profits. Second, Amazon is capitalizing on the rise of AI, thanks to a suite of AI-related services it offers through its cloud. The company is also implementing the technology in-house. For instance, Amazon's industrial robots utilize AI-powered algorithms to optimize travel distances in the company's warehouses, enabling them to handle and deliver packages more efficiently and cost-effectively. Third, Amazon's advertising business should represent yet another important growth driver. As of the end of 2024, the company's advertising revenue run rate was $69 billion, more than doubling since 2020. Amazon is one of the most visited websites in the world, making it an attractive hub for advertisers. These three growth drivers -- the cloud, AI, and advertising-- should maintain solid momentum in the next three years, and well beyond that, for that matter.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy believes we are still in the early innings of the cloud and AI revolutions. Amazon's most important business, cloud computing, is less exposed than Apple to tariff-related concerns. True, if President Donald Trump's policies lead to an economic downturn, spending will decrease for consumers and businesses, resulting in lower revenue for the company's e-commerce and cloud units. Even so, this potential challenge would also impact Apple. Additionally, the latter may have to contend with heavy tariffs on imported goods from abroad, which would disrupt its primary source of revenue and profits. Lastly, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 34.6 may be higher than Apple's 29.2, but the former's premium is well-deserved. Amazon is well-positioned to outpace Apple in the next few years and become a more valuable company by market cap. It should deliver excellent results well beyond that. Alphabet's market cap is $2.5 trillion. It has also grown its revenue faster than Apple much more often than not in the past three years, and has not surpassed the iPhone maker in quarterly sales. Alphabet's advertising business remains its biggest source of sales, thanks to the company's dominance in search. Even AI chatbots haven't made a significant impact on Alphabet's search empire, especially as the company has adapted to this new landscape. Alphabet has added the now highly successful AI overviews to its search engine. Elsewhere, the company's cloud and AI businesses are helping supercharge top-line growth. In the second quarter, Alphabet's cloud division grew by almost 32% year over year, much faster than even AWS. The parent company of Google recently signed a $10 billion, six-year cloud deal with Meta Platforms. In other words, business is booming for Google Cloud. The rest of Alphabet's business, including YouTube, a leader in the streaming industry, is also performing well. Yet, the stock's forward P/E is 22, much lower than Amazon's and Apple's. The market remains concerned that Alphabet may be forced to sell its Chrome browser as part of an antitrust lawsuit, which could significantly disrupt its advertising business. If that happens, Alphabet's shares will plunge. It's worth keeping that risk in mind, while also remembering that forcing companies to divest part of their operations in high-profile antitrust cases is a very rare outcome for the U.S. government. If Alphabet can overcome this obstacle, though, the stock will soar and, over the next three years, could perform well enough to overtake the battered Apple. Should you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "text": "Less than a generation ago, e-commerce was only in its infancy, born on the World Wide Web as a vision of entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos.\nToday, e-commerce accounts for almost $1.2 trillion in annual retail sales in the U.S., or 16% of the total retail industry. Globally, e-commerce sales total more than $5 trillion, led by companies such as Amazon (AMZN 0.17%) and China\u2019s Alibaba Group (BABA -1.53%), plus brick-and-mortar retailers such as Home Depot (HD 0.18%).\nThe tremendous growth in e-commerce has propelled a number of big winners on the stock market, but there's still plenty of opportunity left in online retail. Annual e-commerce sales grew about 15% in the 2010s, and the adoption of online shopping accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAfter the pandemic surge, e-commerce's share of total retail sales actually fell through the beginning of 2022. Growth has slowed as spending patterns normalize following a shift back to brick-and-mortar stores and services such as travel and restaurants, settling at around 7%.

      "text": "Shorthand for \"market capitalization,\" market cap is one way an investor can evaluate how much a company is worth. Market cap refers to the total value of a publicly traded company's shares.\nTo determine a company's market cap, simply multiply the share price by the number of shares outstanding.\nAn example of market capitalization\nAn example of market capitalization\nHere's Costco Wholesale (COST 1.08%) as an example. At recent prices, Costco shares sell for $900, with around 450 million shares outstanding. In this case, $900 times 450 million equals a $400 billion market cap.\nBut why is market cap important and how should you use it? It's one of the best measures of a publicly traded company's size, which can tell you a lot about what to expect if you buy its stock.\n- Large companies tend to have more stable and mature businesses, having proven themselves over time and weathered difficult business conditions to emerge stronger. However, the growth prospects for large companies can be limited because they've already taken advantage of their primary opportunities to grow to their current size.\n- Smaller companies often have more room to grow, but they are typically younger, with riskier business models that haven't yet proved themselves. Their odds of failure can be higher than those of larger companies, which presents added risk.\nHere's a quick breakdown of how market cap ranges are often segmented across companies of different sizes:\n| Type of Stock | Market Capitalization Range |\n|---|---|\n| Mega cap | More than $200 billion |\n| Large cap | $10 billion to $200 billion |\n| Mid cap | $2 billion to $10 billion |\n| Small cap | $300 million to $2 billion |\n| Micro cap | $50 million to $300 million |\nIn general, investors look at the market in the following three categories most often since these are the market cap categories most stocks tend to fall into.\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nLarge-cap stocks have market caps of more than $10 billion. Most of the best-known companies in the world are large caps, and these are typically the companies that have established themselves as the leaders in their industries. While many deal with the ups and downs of their industry's cycles, these are often the strongest companies and have proven capable of holding off competitive threats. Large caps are often where you'll find the best dividend stocks. These large companies often generate more cash than they need for the business and return that extra capital to investors in dividend payments.\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nMid-cap stocks have market caps between $2 and $10 billion, occupying the middle ground between large and small companies. Mid-cap companies often have made considerable progress in building up successful business models, and that gives their investors some stability and protection against the future challenges smaller companies may face. Yet even with some track record, mid caps also may face the daunting task of beating out, or even disrupting, bigger and better-funded large-cap competitors to realize their own financial promise.\nNot all mid caps are growth stocks. They may be companies that operate in a smaller niche without big growth prospects, or they may be former large caps that have declined due to changes in the competitive landscape or (as with many brick-and-mortar retailers) some industry disruption.\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nSmall-cap stocks are generally defined as having market caps between $300 million and $2 billion. Sometimes companies with market caps below $300 million are in this group, although most categorize those as micro-cap stocks. They are generally growth stocks or upstarts just getting their feet under them and looking to do something big. While small-cap stocks have historically delivered above-average returns as a group, many fail to live up to expectations. Small-cap stocks are more volatile than larger caps, meaning there is more risk of losses in the short term. These stocks are generally best owned as a diversified group, and for many years, in order to reduce those risks.\nDividends Per Share\nHow to use market cap\nHow to use market cap\nMarket cap is helpful when evaluating a company's size. But don't let the market value of a company cause you to dismiss large- or even mega-cap stocks as \"too big to buy.\" The global economy is enormous, serving more than 7 billion people and with a fast-growing middle class. A $10 billion company that serves a multi-trillion-dollar market can grow substantially.\nMoreover, companies can deliver strong per-share returns without expanding their market cap fast. Share repurchases that reduce the share count reward long-term investors with a bigger piece of the company, while dividends put money directly back into your pocket. These two things combined can significantly reduce how much market cap needs to grow for investors to get above-average returns.\nRelated investing topics\nConversely, companies -- often small caps that need the cash -- may sell stock to fund growth, pay debt, or just keep the lights on. When this happens, it reduces -- dilutes -- how much of the company each share is worth. For example, if a company with 10 million shares issues and sells 1 million new shares, 10% of your former equity now belongs to the new shareholders. The key here is to consider a company's history of share buybacks and dilution.\nMost investors find that having a diversified portfolio that includes stocks of various market caps is best. It lets you tailor for the desired return and risk levels that meet your goals. If you want your portfolio to be more stable, you'll want a bigger allocation of large-cap stocks. If your primary goal is to increase your portfolio's size as much possible over many years, you'll likely want to own more small- and mid-cap stocks."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
