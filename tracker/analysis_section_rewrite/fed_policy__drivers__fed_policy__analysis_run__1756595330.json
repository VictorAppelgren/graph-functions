Add a citation for the July CPI/PCE release (e.g., (ID = ??)) and for the August 2025 tech‑earnings season (e.g., (ID = ??)); link each to the claim that they are the primary catalyst windows for the S&P 500.  \n2. Explicitly tie the 200 bp DXY decline to the 3–5 % upside: “a DXY drop to 95.8 (≈ 200 bp) is projected to lift the S&P 500 3–5 %” and cite (B1KYJ1GPU)(97MD1FHW8)(Z7O1DCHS7).  \n3. Quantify the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread thresholds: state that a spread > 57 bp signals a 5–10 % downside, a spread < 30 bp signals a 3–5 % upside, and a spread > 70 bp could push the index down 8–10 %; cite (FAN5RYW6T)(Z7O1DCHS7).  \n4. Tighten the causal chain: for each driver (Fed cut, inflation, tech earnings, spread, DXY) list the direct transmission to the equity discount, term premium, and ultimately the S&P 500, with inline citations.  \n5. Remove the stray reference to “30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage rates” (not a direct S&P 500 driver) to avoid drift.  \n6. Add a brief “fragility” note: the upside hinges on a September Fed cut and a steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr curve; the downside is amplified if tech earnings miss consensus or if the spread widens beyond 70 bp.  \n7. Ensure every substantive claim has an explicit citation; replace generic “will” statements with quantified ranges and source IDs.  \n8. Re‑phrase the watch‑list sentence to read: “Key watch signals over the next 90 days are July CPI/PCE, August tech earnings, the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread trajectory, the September Fed meeting, and the DXY’s reaction to any policy shift” and attach the relevant IDs.  \nImplement these edits to meet the truth‑over‑verbosity, market‑mapped, and actionable standards required for a top‑macro PM brief.",
