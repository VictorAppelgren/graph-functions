  "title": "Is Wall Street Bullish or Bearish on Intuit Stock?",
  "description": "Intuit has trailed the broader market over the past year, yet analysts remain strongly optimistic about the stock\u2019s future outlook.",
  "content": "Based in Mountain View, California, Intuit Inc. (INTU) is a $195.6 billion company specializing in financial management, compliance, and marketing solutions. Its offerings span business management and payroll processing tools, personal finance platforms, and widely used tax preparation and filing software.\n\nShares of this software giant have underperformed the broader market over the past year. INTU has gained 4.8% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 14.3%. However, in 2025, INTU\u2019s stock rose 11.2%, surpassing the SPX\u2019s 8.7% rise on a YTD basis.\n\u2022 The Quantum Computing Race Is On: These 2 Stocks Appear Poised to Lead\n\u2022 Should You Buy the Pullback in Palantir Stock Today?\n\u2022 Warren Buffett Says Don\u2019t Invest in Berkshire Hathaway Unless You \u2018Understand Our Operations, Attitudes and Expectations\u2019\n\u2022 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief \u2013 your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nNarrowing the focus, INTU has also trailed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV), which has gained about 22.7% over the past year. However, INTU\u2019s gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF\u2019s 6.2% returns over the same time frame.\n\nOn July 23, Intuit shares rose 1.2% after the company rolled out new agentic AI capabilities for its Enterprise Suite. The update introduced four AI agents designed to automate functions such as cash flow forecasting and invoice reminders. Built on its GenOS platform, these enhancements are designed for mid-market businesses, aiming to improve productivity and capture a larger share of the $89 billion ERP market.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in July, analysts expect INTU\u2019s EPS to grow 26.8% to $14.72 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 30 analysts covering INTU stock, the consensus is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 23 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, three \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d three \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThis configuration has been consistent over the past months.\n\nOn Aug. 15, Citigroup analyst Steven Enders reaffirmed a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Intuit and raised the price target from $789 to $815, a 3.3% increase, signaling sustained confidence in the company\u2019s market performance.\n\nThe mean price target of $817.96 represents a 17% premium to INTU\u2019s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $1000 suggests an upside potential of 43%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Kritika Sarmah did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
