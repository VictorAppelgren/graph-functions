      "summary": "The UK government has taken control of Speciality Steel, the third-largest steelworks in the country, to protect 1,450 jobs amid its compulsory liquidation. The decision has been criticized by company officials as irrational, especially given potential investment plans that could have secured jobs and operations. The government will cover ongoing costs while the Official Receiver manages the liquidation process, and GFG, the parent company, plans to bid for control of the business. Concerns have been raised about the impact on workers and the domestic steel supply chain.",
