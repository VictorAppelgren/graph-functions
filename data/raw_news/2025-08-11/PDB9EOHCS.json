      "text": "If you've been seeing all of the Backstreet Boys hype on social media, it's not too late to witness the legendary boy band at the Las Vegas Sphere. Their 21-show residency kicked off on July 11 and continues through the summer, but seats have been flying fast, leaving mostly verified resellers to secure your place. I've broken down how to buy Backstreet Boys tickets below to help you out.\nThe Backstreet Boys made their debut in 1993 and remain one of the most popular boy bands of all time. Their new Las Vegas residency, which will be built around the futuristic themes and songs of their \"Millennium\" album, is an ode to the album's original 130-show tour in 1999, also similarly titled \"Into the Millennium.\"\nThe Venetian Resort's Sphere is a famous venue reserved for legendary musicians. It currently hosts Kenny Chesney and has the Backstreet Boys scheduled for later this summer. The venue has also recently hosted the Eagles and Dead and Company. The location's unique architecture lends to a completely immersive, once-in-a-lifetime experience that can't be missed for fans of the performing artist.\nGeneral ticket sales are in full swing, and seats are selling out fast. But if you're still hoping to secure your tickets to the 2025 Backstreet Boys residency, we're here to help. Ahead, find our breakdown of the 2025 residency schedule, purchasing details, comparisons between prices for original and resale tickets, and the potential setlist.

The tour has already been extended twice since its announcement, adding additional dates in August. Since no following performers have been scheduled for the Sphere afterward, there is also a chance that the Backstreet Boys residency can gain even more shows in the future.\nThe chart below shows the cheapest tickets found on StubHub and Vivid Seats, if available, at the time of writing.

      "text": "Bruno Mars is returning for another Park MGM Las Vegas residency, and despite the dozens of shows the singer has headlined at the venue, tickets are in high demand. They've largely sold out, leaving only resale options, but there are still plenty of seats available to see the artist live. I've broken down how to get Bruno Mars tickets so you can secure your spot at his summer show.\nAfter rising to fame for his hit single \"Just the Way You Are\" in 2010, Bruno Mars is still making tracks that are just as popular and performing them on the road 15 years later. Following the release of his chart-topping album \"24K Magic,\" the 15-time Grammy winner began a concert residency at the Park MGM in Las Vegas in 2016, now in its ninth consecutive year.\nWe've got you covered if you're looking for how to get tickets to Bruno Mars' 2025 Las Vegas residency concert dates. Here's our breakdown of Bruno Mars' 2025 concert schedule, purchasing details, and price comparisons between original and resale tickets. You can also browse ticket specifics on StubHub and Vivid Seats at your leisure.\n- See also: Las Vegas Sphere tickets | Lady Gaga tickets | Blackpink tickets | Coldplay tickets | Dua Lipa tickets | Eagles tickets | Oasis tickets | Shakira tickets\nBruno Mars 2025 tour schedule\nFollowing another brief hiatus, Bruno Mars' Las Vegas residency returns in August this year, continuing through the first week of September. All shows listed below will take place at the Park MGM in Las Vegas.\n| Date | StubHub prices | Vivid Seats prices |\n| August 22, 2025 | $503 | $477 |\n| August 23, 2025 | $433 | $471 |\n| August 26, 2025 | $366 | $368 |\n| August 27, 2025 | $389 | $375 |\n| August 30, 2025 | $503 | $499 |\n| August 31, 2025 | $422 | $418 |\n| September 3, 2025 | $418 | $395 |\n| September 5, 2025 | $496 | $460 |\n| September 6, 2025 | $503 | $494 |\n- Follow our WhatsApp channel and Instagram for more deals and buying guides.\nHow to buy tickets for Bruno Mars' 2025 concert tour\nYou can buy original tickets for Bruno Mars' 2025 Las Vegas residency on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all concert dates have tickets available; however, original tickets sold out for the 2024 residency, so we expect to see that trend continue in 2025.\nTickets are also available for purchase through resale ticket vendors such as StubHub and Vivid Seats, and they are currently comparable in price to the original tickets. Since the original tickets are expected to sell out, you may find better luck with seating variety and pricing options through these resale sites.\nAs is typically the case with Las Vegas shows, several VIP packages are available. These packages include a range of different perks, from seats to suites, so if you are looking to plan a trip around your visit, it may be worth reviewing your options. Additional information on what each package includes and the prices can be found here.\nHow much are Bruno Mars tickets?\nFrankly, tickets to see Bruno Mars' Las Vegas residency in 2025 aren't cheap, but prices do vary depending on the date and demand for each show.\nThe most affordable tickets start at $367 from Vivid Seats and $374 from StubHub as of writing.\nWho is opening for Bruno Mars' tour?\nBruno Mars' Las Vegas concert dates will not feature opening acts. This is consistent with his previous residency, so we do not expect any openers to be announced. In the past, Anderson.Paak, Camila Cabello, and Dua Lipa have opened for Mars on tour.\nWill there be international tour dates?\nThere are currently no international tour dates announced as Mars is currently scheduled to perform exclusively in Las Vegas.\nNote: Certain services and regions prohibit the resale of tickets. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal reselling of tickets, and entry into an event is at the venue's discretion.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

Original tickets for the Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos World Tour are available on the Colombian Ticket Master website, if they haven\u2019t sold out already.\nFortunately, Bad Bunny Tickets are available through verified resale websites like StubHub and Vivid Seats. It should be noted, however, that Vivid Seats does not carry tickets for all countries that Bad Bunny will be performing in.\nHow much are Bad Bunny tickets?\nPrices for standard tickets to Bad Bunny's residency and Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos World Tour vary significantly depending on date, location, and availability. Overall, prices for the Puerto Rico residency are significantly higher than prices for the rapper\u2019s world stadium tour.\nOn StubHub, the lowest resale prices range from $53 for the March 1, 2026, show in Sydney to $752 for the concert in San Juan on September 13, 2025. Overall, the least expensive StubHub tickets tend to fall between $600 and $700 for the residency this fall and $100 to $200 for the 2025-2026 world tour.\nVivid Seats offers similar price ranges for Bad Bunny's performances, starting between $113 on June 3, 2026, in Madrid and $732 for the show in San Juan on September 14, 2025. Overall, the least expensive Vivid Seats tickets tend to fall in the same ranges as StubHub.\nWho is opening for Bad Bunny's tour?\nAs is typical of residencies, Bad Bunny had no openers for his Puerto Rico shows. No openers have been announced for the Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos World Tour for 2025 and 2026. His 2024 Most Wanted Tour did not feature any openers, so there may not be any this time around, either..\nWill there be international tour dates?\nAll of Bad Bunny's coming performances for both the ongoing residency and his Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos World Tour will be international, with the rapper appearing in major cities across Central America, South America, Australia, and Europe. No North American dates have been announced, so many fans hoping to see Bad Bunny live in 2025 or 2026 may have to travel to do so.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

I've broken down how to buy Coldplay tickets before their next date below.\nFollowing the release of their October 2024 album \u201cMoon Music,\u201d Chris Martin and Coldplay announced that they would stay on the road throughout 2025 to travel across various cities in the United States and Canada. The upcoming shows are part of their ongoing Music of the Spheres Tour, which began in 2022 following the debut of their eponymous 2021 album. The latest extension brings the tour\u2019s total show count to over 200 concerts, during which the band has already accrued more than $1 billion in box office sales.\nThe 2025 North American leg of Coldplay\u2019s Music of the Spheres Tour includes an additional 17 shows across various cities. These concert dates join Coldplay\u2019s 2025 performances in Asia before the band returns to London. After three years on the road, Coldplay is currently scheduled to bring their Music of the Spheres Tour to a close on September 8, 2025, after a 10-show stint at Wembley Stadium in London.\nWe\u2019ve got you covered if you\u2019re looking for how to get tickets to Coldplay\u2019s 2025 Music of the Spheres Tour.

However, the quantity of remaining standard original tickets is limited due to high demand, with all of the United States, Canada, and England concert dates already being sold out.\nTickets for Coldplay\u2019s 2025 Music of the Spheres Tour can also be purchased through verified resale ticket vendors such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Given the limited or sold-out inventory of standard original tickets, you may have better luck with availability and seating variety on these resale sites.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Vivid Seats does not have tickets being sold for Coldplay\u2019s 2025 Abu Dhabi, Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Seoul shows.\nHow much are Coldplay tickets?\nTicket prices for Coldplay\u2019s 2025 Music of the Spheres tour vary depending on the date, location, and demand for each show. Currently, original tickets on Ticketmaster are already sold out, which means the available ticket prices are based on resale passes.\nOn StubHub, the least expensive resale tickets for Coldplay\u2019s 2025 concerts range from $132 for their Seoul, South Korea, date on April 16, to $507 for the band\u2019s Kingston upon Hull, England, show on August 18. Vivid Seats offers similar resale ticket prices for the Music of the Spheres Tour, with the cheapest available ticket costs starting from $160 for their April 16 Seoul show to $572 for Coldplay\u2019s August 30 concert in London.

      "text": "StubHub is one of the most popular ticket resale sites for online shoppers, making it a household name alongside Ticketmaster and Live Nation. In the age where scams lurk behind every corner, it's scary to trust any site with something like your money or a once-in-a-lifetime event. With that in mind, I dove deeper into StubHub's guarantees and conditions to explain why so many eventgoers, like myself, trust the platform.\nFor those who haven't used or heard of it before, StubHub is a website marketplace that allows fans of sporting events, musicians, comedians, and other live acts to buy and sell tickets to each other in a regulated space. It services more than just the US, too, offering seats to coveted performances in countries around the world.\nKeep reading to learn more about StubHub's protections for both buyers and sellers.\nIs StubHub legit?\nIn short, StubHub is a trustworthy place to buy and sell tickets for major events. Although the company itself is not the seller, it still offers safeguards for both parties in a sale to prevent any potential scams from occurring. It does mean, however, that StubHub does not control the pricing for event tickets \u2014 these are set by the users selling them. The site will instead recommend price points for sellers during the listing process.\nStubHub gives a 100% guarantee to every order under its exclusive FanProtect Guarantee, which I've broken down below.\nHow StubHub protects ticket buyers\nTicket buying from a reseller is sometimes the only option for sold-out and high-demand shows. StubHub is a great place to find tickets, especially with its FanProtect Guarantee to cover orders. Here's what it promises for buyers:\n- Tickets will be delivered in time for the event.\n- The ticket will be valid for the event.\n- Issues will be resolved with comparable or better tickets or a refund.\n- Event cancellations that aren't rescheduled can be reimbursed with a 120% StubHub credit or a full refund.\nFor even more information, you can check out StubHub's buyer terms and conditions.\nHow StubHub protects ticket sellers\nWhether you've changed your mind or need to cancel a scheduled event, StubHub is a simple platform for ticket sellers. Listing is quick and easy, and pricing research isn't necessary with the site's recommendations. It also protects its sellers just as well as its buyers under the same FanProtect Guarantee.\nStubHub's main promise is on-time payment for tickets sold. The full seller terms and conditions explain this more thoroughly.\nWhat about StubHub fees?\nOf course, such protections don't come without a price. StubHub, like every other third-party, charges fees for both fans and sellers. For the latter, you don't pay anything until your tickets sell. Percentages aren't set in stone; they can differ based on ticket prices, event dates, supply, and demand.\nOnly two costs are added to purchases: a service fee and a fulfillment fee. These can be viewed before, during, and after checkout \u2014 here's how:\n- Before checkout: Click on the event page filters and change \"Price Display Options\" to \"Include estimated fees.\"\n- During checkout: The entire cost is broken down on the \"Review and buy\" page, underneath \"Your order summary.\"\n- After checkout: Check your order receipt to see the fee breakdown at the bottom.\nHead on over to StubHub to browse the latest ticket prices for concerts, live sports, comedy shows, and more.\nBrowse all of our ticket coverage here. Follow our Instagram and WhatsApp channels for more deals and buying guides.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

They come full of energy, genuinely love performing, and it shows. It was amazing that there was no opening band and the ticket prices were extremely reasonable.

It was a wonderful wonderful time.\nAwesome concert, unique venue, very enjoyable! Maroon 5 put on an incredible show, full of energy and every song a hit! Entertainment, product booths, and beverages available before and after the event makes it a full evening of enjoyment.\nPaid for parking and they gave us a ride to the front entrance.
