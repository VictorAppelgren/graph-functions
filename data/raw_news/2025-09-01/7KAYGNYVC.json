  "description": "Cleaning fan and content creator Chantel Mila shared a simple hack for your next deep clean, that will help tackle tough burnt-on grease in the kitchen.",
  "content": "Grease and grime can be a common problem to deal with around the home, especially in the kitchen thanks to food splatters and spills. However, to combat any unsightly tough grease, a cleaning fan shared how you can use a common kitchen ingredient to make your own homemade cleaning solution - and it\u2019s completely natural. For anyone who prefers avoiding chemical products, TikTok creator Chantel Mila, more popularly known as Mama Mila, suggested white vinegar. In a recent video, Chantel explained that a simple white vinegar solution is the perfect hack to include in your next deep clean. This is what you\u2019ll need to do.\n\nTo make the easy solution, Chantel instructed to mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. This can then be sprayed over different surfaces in the kitchen which have been stained with hard burnt-on grease. White vinegar is a particularly effective natural ingredient to use in homemade cleaning remedies due to its level of acidity - as well its acetic acid content - helps dissolve any dirt, grease and grime. The acidity can help soften any hard, crunchy bits of grease, which makes it easier to wipe away, explained How Stuff Works. It went on to explain that for the best results, the vinegar should be applied to any surface when the surface is hot. It can also help to kill bacteria on surfaces.\n\nThe Spruce noted that distilled white vinegar and cleaning vinegar are great options for deep cleaning. White vinegar can also be used as a preventative grease fighter for your pots and pans. Acetic acid helps to dissolve various mineral build-ups, including limescale deposits. It also helps to kill bacteria and fungi that cause bad and unwanted smells as vinegar is a natural deodoriser. Another benefit of vinegar is that it\u2019s a natural disinfectant, which helps to effectively remove built-up grime.\n\nIt also acts as a natural antibacterial, antiseptic, and bleaching agent, helping to cut through grease, remove stains, and kill bacteria, making them a versatile eco-friendly alternative to commercial cleaning products. If you don\u2019t see results straight away, don\u2019t be disheartened. The experts at Purdy & Figg explained that using vinegar needs patience and a good amount of elbow grease. It also explained that vinegar may not work on \u201cingrained\u201d problems such as cloudy glasses and old stains, as some of these \u201cmay never be solved\u201d even when you use stronger chemical cleaners.",

And unless you're Samantha from \"Bewitched\" and can make problems disappear with just a twitch of your nose, you know a good scrub is on its way.\nWater alone can't get rid of grease because water molecules don't stick to grease molecules. And elbow grease isn't always enough to tackle the baked-on gunk found in kitchens. Commercial grease cleaners can do the trick for most messes, but if you don't have any products on hand (or you'd rather use products without harsh chemicals), what else can you do?\nAdvertisement\nThere are ways to fight grease using things you already have around your home.

Eventually, that trapped build-up will redeposit onto your laundry leaving it dingy and smelling less than fresh. Regularly cleaning your washing machine will give you cleaner laundry and extend the life of your machine. Here's how to clean every type of washing machine with vinegar.

The acid also helps kill bacteria and fungi that cause odors. Vinegar, when diluted, will not harm clothing and easily rinses away during the washer's rinse cycle. How to Clean a Top Loading Washer With Vinegar Credit: The Spruce / Jorge Gamboa Empty the Washer and Set Controls Be sure any automatic dispensers are empty of detergent, bleach, and fabric softener and that the washer drum is empty. Set the water temperature to hot water. Select the largest load setting and the longest wash cycle available. Add Distilled White Vinegar to the Drum Pour in two cups, and allow the machine to run through the entire hot water cycle. Check and Clean Automatic Dispeners If the dispensers are removable and need further cleaning, wash them in hot, soapy water, rinse, and replace them. If not, pour warm distilled vinegar into the dispensers, let it sit, and flush it away in the rinse cycle. Clean the Outside of the Washing Machine Mix a solution of warm water and a few drops of dishwashing liquid. Dip a microfiber cloth in the solution and wipe down the machine. Open the lid and dip an old toothbrush into the soapy water to get into corners and tight places on the lid. How to Clean a Front Loading Washer With Vinegar Credit: The Spruce / Ulyana Verbytska Empty the Dispensers, and Add Vinegar Be sure the dispensers are empty of detergent, bleach, and fabric softener and that the washer drum is empty. Add two cups of distilled white vinegar to the detergent dispenser. Select the Cycle and Wash Temperature Many front-loading washers have designated cleaning cycles and you should choose it if that is an option. If not, select the longest wash cycle, largest load size, and hot water. Clean the Dispenser Drawer Rinse the drawer and inserts in hot tap water to remove traces of accumulated powders and liquids. If they are heavily coated with built-up residue, let them soak for 10 minutes in hot water, then rinse. Allow the drawers to air-dry. Run a Final Rinse Cycle This will flush away any debris trapped in the washer. Clean the Outside of the Washer While the rinse cycle is running, use a microfiber cloth dipped in hot, soapy water\u2014use an all-purpose cleaner or a few drops of dishwashing liquid\u2014to wipe away dust, dirt, and product drip from the outside of the washer. Should I Use Bleach or Vinegar to Clean My Washing Machine? Credit: The Spruce / Olivia Inman Distilled white vinegar is not as effective at killing bacteria and fungus as chlorine bleach, especially when diluted with the water required to run a washing machine cycle. Undiluted vinegar can dissolve hard water deposits but the acid can also damage some rubber washer components like hoses and gaskets. Before cleaning any washer, especially a new one, read the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning. The use of vinegar for cleaning may void some machine warranties. How to Maintain a Clean Washing Machine A standard top-load washer should be cleaned at least four times per year, especially if you live in a hard water area. High-efficiency top-load washers and front-load washers use much less water than standard machines and should be cleaned every month. Detergent and fabric softeners may build up in the dispenser drawers and cause odor and operational problems. Residue should be removed once or twice a month. After running a load of clothes through your front-load washing machine, you should leave the door open so it can air dry to prevent mold and odors from developing. To keep a washer clean longer, use the right amount of detergent. More is not always better because it leaves build-up in the washer. FAQ How often should I clean my washing machine? Cleaning your washing machine once a month is a good guideline for high-efficiency machines, which use less water and can be prone to build-up. Standard top-load washing machines can be washed four times a year. Clean a high-efficiency or standard washing machine monthly if you regularly run heavily soiled loads or live in a hot and humid climate where mold can grow more easily. How do I know if my washer needs cleaning? If your clothes are not getting as clean as they should be, a build-up of mineral deposits, old detergent, grime, or mold could cause your washer to be less effective. Other signs your washer needs cleaning include musty odors; mold on the door gasket; a clogged or foul-smelling lint filter; leftover detergent on the automatic dispenser; or soil, pet hair, and other debris stuck to the door and drum. What is the best thing to clean the inside of a washing machine? Vinegar is a great all-purpose cleaner to remove mineral build up and help kill odor-causing bacteria and fungi. If you have a moldy and musty-smelling machine, chlorine bleach is the most effective for killing mold and mildew. Hydrogen peroxide is a less harsh swap for chlorine bleach, but never mix the two. What is the quickest way to clean a washing machine? For a quick way to clean your machine without running a cycle, start by spraying the interior with a 50-50 solution of vinegar and water, and wiping down the interior door and drum with a soft cloth. Next, spray and wipe the door and gasket, making sure to get into the folds and remove any gunk. Finally, remove the dispenser drawer and give it a good rinse.
