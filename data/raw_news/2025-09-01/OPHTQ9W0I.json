  "content": "Inflation dynamics, fraud threats, real-time rails, AI adoption, and mobile shift are shaping Q4 priorities and are key trends banks must monitor and embrace.\n\nBanks and credit unions are proving resilient amid macro volatility as they evolve digitally and manage risks.\n\nAs inflation, interest-rate swings and economic uncertainty converge, banks and credit unions (CUs) have demonstrated notable resilience. They are continuing to innovate digitally, enhance risk controls and evolve service models to meet shifting consumer and business needs.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nFall is settling in, financial institutions (FIs) large and small have the opportunity to help customers grapple with macro pressures. Below are five trends to watch as we move into the final quarter of 2025.\n\nConsumer inflation expectations remain elevated, though we\u2019re well below recent highs. As reported at the end of September, consumers see inflation at roughly 4% to 6% through the next year. Meanwhile, planned household spending growth slipped to 5% from 5.2% recently, and fewer expect easier credit availability (10.6% vs. 12.1%).\n\nBanks and credit unions can support consumers by offering budgeting tools, personalized advice and flexible installment or pay-later structures. PYMNTS Intelligence finds many CU members facing financial stress value tailored financial wellness offerings and support tools as 63% of members use their CU-issued cards to purchase groceries, and 37% use them to cover utility bills.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence shows consumers and small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) now expect reliability alongside speed, prompting banks to pursue multi-rail strategies that balance both.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. and Canadian networks continue expanding ceilings: FedNow doubled its cap from $500,000 to $1 million, and The Clearing House enabled on-behalf-of transactions, opening high-value use cases like payroll, B2B and real estate transfers. Consumers are even willing to pay fees for instant payouts, especially younger or financially constrained users (27% slightly and 20% much higher).\n\nAlthough many institutions remain wary of real-time payment fraud, PYMNTS Intelligence found fraud is actually 31\u00d7 more likely on checks than on real-time rails. Still, nearly 28% of consumers experienced credit card fraud last year, and 37% report high concern, while 90% of those whose banks proactively addressed fraud were very satisfied.\n\nBanks should consider next-gen tools like tap-to-authenticate metal cards (preferred by 77% of FI respondents vs. 25% for plastic options) to curb credential-based fraud. Behavioral analytics and consortium data sharing (minimalist and privacy-respecting) can amplify detection, as experts argue fraud response demands human oversight and shared signals across institutions.\n\nBanks are embedding conversational AI and agentic AI capabilities to power customer engagement, risk modeling, fraud detection and compliance tasks. Institutions from JPMorgan to SoFi now use conversational AI to nudge customers and scale service. AI agents reportedly free up compliance officers from form-filling work (85% of tasks), becoming a scalable competitive advantage. Yet experts caution against leaning too hard on AI without robust human-led data intelligence; proven legacy and vetted alternative data should underpin model decisions.\n\nBanks are embedding conversational AI and agentic AI into everything from customer service to risk modeling and compliance workflows. Across Q2 earnings, institutions like U.S. Bank highlighted AI-driven payment infrastructure investments aimed at modernizing operations. Meanwhile, nCino reported subscription revenue growth of 15%, and said its agentic AI-expanded Banking Advisor product is already deployed across more than 80 institutions.\n\nRecent earnings commentary from major banks, including JPMorgan and Capital One, reaffirm the ongoing shift toward mobile and digital channels, with Zelle transaction volumes now surpassing checks and ATM withdrawals at Bank of America.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence research finds nearly half of consumers use mobile banking weekly, with Gen Z and small businesses relying on app-based onboarding, instant card issuance and mobile credit tools. High-performing credit unions now achieve 92% digital onboarding and 85% mobile card issuance adoption, advantages not seen at lower-performing peers.",

      "text": "Innovation is no longer a luxury but a defining factor for credit unions striving to thrive in the current financial ecosystem. As consumer and small to medium-sized business (SMB) expectations rapidly shift toward digital convenience and tailored experiences, credit unions face increasing pressure to modernize their offerings, not just to compete with traditional banks, but to maintain relevance.\nAt the forefront of this modernization is digital onboarding, as customers interact with CUs to open accounts and access services.\nTop-performing credit unions leverage that digital point of contact to deepen member loyalty, grow market share, and unlock significant cross-selling opportunities.\nThe latest PYMNTS Intelligence \u201cCredit Union Innovation Readiness Index,\u201d done in collaboration with Velera, reveals a clear mandate for digital transformation, especially concerning member acquisition and engagement.\nA Shift to Digital Channels\nWhile approximately half of credit union members still prefer to apply for new products in person, there\u2019s a pronounced shift among key growth segments towards digital channels. For instance, Generation Z consumers rank digital onboarding 78% higher in importance than the average consumer, underscoring their digital-first mindset.\nSimilarly, 68% of SMBs that recently switched away from a credit union express a clear preference for online onboarding for new product applications. Millennials, too, show a strong inclination, with 52% expecting digital onboarding. These figures highlight that a lack of robust digital tools, including seamless digital onboarding, is a significant factor in member churn.\nA Gateway to Cross-Selling\nFor credit unions, digital onboarding is more than just a convenience; it\u2019s a strategic gateway to a deeper, more comprehensive digital relationship with members. Once a member is digitally onboarded, the credit union gains immediate access to a digital touchpoint, which can be leveraged for future cross-selling of additional products and services.\nTop-performing credit unions understand this deeply, focusing on \u201cbuilding smarter\u201d by aligning their innovation efforts closely with member expectations. They are not just offering more features, but features that truly resonate and drive satisfaction.\nData from the Index illustrates this approach. Top-performing credit unions are significantly more likely to offer crucial digital capabilities that complement digital onboarding. For example, they are 48% more likely to offer mobile credit card apps compared to bottom performers (48% versus 7%), and a staggering 86% offer open banking compared to only 13% of bottom performers. Budgeting tools also show a wide gap, with 53% of top performers offering them versus 27% of bottom performers.\nWhile 40% of bottom-performing credit unions are still focused on launching new basic products, 47% of top performers are prioritizing new features that elevate the member experience.\nThe data show that through the next few years, 92% of top-performing credit unions plan to offer digital onboarding, 74% will enable instant card issuance and 85% will provide mobile credit card apps. This foresight ensures they can continue to meet rising member expectations and capitalize on opportunities to expand product usage. For instance, SMBs using credit union-issued cards as their primary payment method are 50% more likely to value loyalty programs, demonstrating how an initial digital relationship can be nurtured to encourage further engagement and product adoption.\nPartnerships Are Critical\nFinally, credit unions are not going it alone in this digital transformation. The report highlights the critical role of external partnerships. A remarkable 79% of all credit unions, including 83% of top performers, cite external partners as instrumental in helping them innovate faster and at greater scale."

      "text": "Among the consumer that PYMNTS surveyed, 46.8% surveyed said they\u2019d engaged with mobile banking apps at least weekly, equating to 11 \u201cactivity days\u201d per month, more than the 6.7 days spent online shopping. More than 16% of consumers said they checked mobile banking apps daily.\nAll told, only 20% of consumers indicated that they did not use mobile or online banking offerings at least once a month. In the United States, across more than 12,500 individuals queried, just under half used mobile banking at least weekly, per PYMNTS Intelligence data.\nWe are only about two weeks into earnings season, but commentary and details tied to banks\u2019 March quarter reports have highlighted the continued digital shift within financial services, where speed and convenience continue to draw customers toward setting up accounts and managing their money on their phones, while engaging with chat features and other self-service points of interactions. The rockiness of the macro-economic trends right now is not deterring continued investment in those experiences.\nGrowth in Active Mobile Customers\nFor example, JPMorgan\u2019s earnings materials show that at the end of the latest quarter, the largest bank (by asset size) counted 59 active mobile customers up 8% year over year. CEO Jamie Dimon noted on the call with analysts that \u201cthe investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment.\u201d\nWells Fargo\u2019s supplementals indicate that mobile-active customers at the end of the quarter were 31.8 million, up from 30.5 million last year.\nCEO Charlie Scharf said on the call: \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to invest in refurbishing our branches, while at the same time making enhancements to our account opening experience in both our digital and branch channels. In the first quarter, active mobile customers grew 4% from a year ago and digital account openings continued to grow.\u201d\nRetail bank branches declined at the end of the most recent period to 4,155, from 4,247 a year ago.\nDisplacing Cash\nBank of America\u2019s CEO Brian Moynihan told investors: \u201cOur digital engagement and sales continue to expand across all our businesses. We saw more than 14 billion log-ins in 2024.\u201d\nErica, the bank\u2019s virtual financial assistant, has surpassed 2.7 billion interactions since its inception. Transactions sent through Zelle at Bank of America are, the CEO said, \u201cnot only 3x the number of checks written by our Bank of America customers, but also 1.3x the number of checks written plus the number of cash transactions, taking money out of the ATM. It\u2019s also worth noting that digitally-enabled sales in our Consumer business across the board reached 65% of total sales.\u201d\nCFO Alistair Borthwick said on the call that \u201cour new accounts continue to be predominantly opened digitally.\u201d Seventy-eight percent of households were digitally active, up from 76% a year ago.\nEarnings material from the bank show that active digital users in the latest quarter were 49 million, up from 47 million last year. There were 3.9 billion active sessions logged in over digital and mobile channels in the first quarter, compared to 3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Sixty-eight percent of check deposits were done digitally, up from 64% as measured in 2022.\nAs for further evidence of self-service activity, Erica interactions on CashPro Chat were 33.5 million, higher than the 32.5 million last year in the first quarter. Proactive Alerts and Insights were 23.4 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 21.2 million in the commensurate period a year ago.\nAnd as PYMNTS reported in coverage of Capital One\u2019s earnings, CEO Richard Fairbank said on the earnings call that with the pending acquisition of Discover, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to build a bank with leaner economics that comes from not having branches all over the place, and also to be very, very modern in its technology and its digital experiences. In terms of the customer base that we attract to self-select a more digitally first kind of experience.\u201d"

      "text": "While real-time payments have been on the horizon for some time, the expectation for instant access has extended to disbursements.\nAs consumers increasingly receive payments like earnings, tax refunds, insurance claims and loan disbursements from corporate and government entities, they are turning to instant payment methods more often, primarily driven by a need for immediate access and the assurance that money is readily available.\nA Long-Standing Trend\nThe shift isn\u2019t a minor trend. The share of consumers who primarily receive nongovernment disbursements instantly has surged nearly tenfold since 2017, reaching 38%, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cDigital Transformation and Instant Payments Fuel Business Disbursement Efficiency,\u201d an Ingo Payments collaboration.\nThe report found that instant payments growth is fueled by a preference for speed, certainty and convenience.\nParents and young generations show a stronger preference for instant disbursement options. A core driver behind this demand is urgency. One in four disbursement receivers reported needing their money in 30 minutes or less. This urgency is intrinsically linked to the certainty that funds are immediately available, combined with financial need.\nConsumers cited peace of mind from having funds in their account (32%) and various financial needs (over half cited as most important), such as paying bills, handling emergency expenses, buying essential items or making debt repayments, as key reasons for wanting instant disbursements.\nThe larger the disbursement, the more likely consumers are to want it immediately, particularly for amounts exceeding $500. Specific disbursement types, like sports betting payouts, also showed high urgency.\nThis acute need for immediate access translates into an opportunity for financial institutions and service providers. Consumers are demonstrating a growing willingness to pay a premium for faster access to their money, particularly in urgent situations.\nNearly half of disbursement receivers said they are open to paying higher fees for instant transactions when funds are urgently needed. Specifically, 27% are willing to pay a slightly higher fee, and 20% are willing to pay a much higher fee.\nThis willingness is more pronounced among certain demographics. Young consumers are more willing to pay higher fees for urgent instant funds. While 80% of baby boomers are unwilling to pay more in urgent situations, approximately three-quarters of Generation Zers would pay a slightly higher fee, with 44% willing to pay a much higher fee. Consumers living paycheck-to-paycheck with bill-paying issues are also more inclined to pay slightly (60%) or significantly (26%) higher fees, indicating that financial constraint combined with urgency drives willingness to pay.\nConsumers who prefer digital payments are also more likely to receive instant payments often. Their preferred methods for receiving instant funds include direct deposit into their bank accounts, facilitated by options like Zelle and push-to-debit, although the use of digital wallets like PayPal for instant receipts is also growing.\nBy integrating instant payout solutions, businesses and financial institutions can meet consumer demand and potentially capture additional revenue streams through premium offerings.\nThe demand for instant transactions in the disbursement space is a fundamental shift. Companies, including employers and service providers, that adapt by integrating instant payout solutions are better positioned to meet consumer expectations, enhance satisfaction and tap into new revenue potential, particularly by catering to the urgent needs of financially constrained and young consumers. Failing to do so risks losing users to competitors."

      "text": "As PYMNTS reported Monday (June 9), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s latest reading on inflation expectations indicates that households see declines in inflation\u2019s growth \u2014 we emphasize the \u201cgrowth\u201d here, as it still indicates an expected surge in prices through the next year.\nMedian inflation expectations for one year ahead declined by 0.4 percentage point to 3.2%. For three years ahead, it declined by 0.2 percentage point to 3%; for five years ahead, it declined by 0.1 percentage point to 2.6%, according to the release. The annualized paces are still broadly above the target rate that is often the goal of the central bank itself.\nThe data also shows that consumers expect food prices to see an accelerated pace of inflation over the next year. In fact, per the Fed, the year-ahead expected change in food prices increased by 0.4 percentage point to 5.5%, the highest level since October 2023. That pace is quite a bit higher than the overall pace described above.\nNo Real Relief?\nThere are indications that a slowdown in inflation would scarcely be felt by the average U.S consumer.\nConsider the fact that the same survey released on Monday showed that consumers are paring their spending plans. Median nominal household spending growth expectations declined by 0.2 percentage point to 5%, remaining just above the trailing 12-month average of 4.9%. Expectations for future credit availability, in the words of the Fed survey, \u201cdeteriorated, with the share of respondents expecting it will be easier to obtain credit a year from now decreasing to 10.6% from 12.1%.\u201d\nCredit would be needed as an option to plug the gaps, as the median expected growth in household income increased, but not by much. The Fed reported that households see their incomes rising by 0.1 percentage point to 2.7% through the next year, as surveyed last month, while remaining well below the trailing 12-month average of 3%. Incomes are rising more slowly than inflation, certainly as perceived in the year ahead.\nWe\u2019ll know more about the reality of prices when the Consumer Price Index is released on Wednesday (June 11). As always, the categories are volatile. Last month, we reported that the cost of housing gained momentum; food saw a bit of a slowdown in inflation, due in part to a pullback in egg prices.\nThe difference between what the government reports and what is felt in the pocketbook has been detailed by PYMNTS. Consumers measure inflation, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote, \u201cby her perception of how much more things cost [and] uses that as a benchmark for how she measures a healthy economy.\u201d\nA separate PYMNTS Intelligence report surveyed businesses\u2019 planned responses to the ongoing uncertainty over tariffs: 42% of goods firms and 21% of services firms said they planned to increase prices in response to tariffs. The New York Fed said in a recent study, as reported last week, that nearly a third of manufacturers and about half of service companies had already begun passing all of those higher costs to consumers.\nConsumers, then, may be (slightly) more sanguine about inflation, but the reality may sting our collective wallets."

      "text": "Lending a Hand: Empowering CU Members in a Challenging Economy\nCredit unions lead in satisfaction and trust among financial institutions, but satisfaction dips with financially stressed members, who seek more personalization, support and digital ease to stay engaged. Can CUs be their port in a storm?\n01\nCredit unions lead banks in satisfaction, trust and service\u2014but that edge fades for members facing financial instability.

With many CU members navigating financial stress, expectations have increased for digital services that include budgeting tools and personalized support where and when it matters most.\nForward-thinking credit unions are responding, updating legacy systems and investing in digital innovations to meet rising member needs. Members clearly appreciate the CU value proposition and caring community of advisers, but efforts must continue. Achieving strong satisfaction among all members\u2014regardless of their circumstances\u2014is CUs\u2019 best guarantee of engagement in a changing financial landscape.\nCUs Struggle to Reach Financially Unhealthy Members\nCredit unions lead banks in satisfaction, trust and service\u2014but that edge fades for members facing financial instability. These members now form the majority of CU membership, placing pressure on CUs to deliver more targeted, timely support that builds real resilience.\nFinancial uncertainty reshapes member needs and CU response strategies.\nVelera CEO Chuck Fagan says consumers are navigating mixed signals\u2014balancing optimism with concern about inflation and rising costs. This shifting mindset makes predicting behavior harder, but it clarifies where CUs can help. Financial education, budgeting tools and support systems matter more now than ever for sustaining trust and engagement with CU members.\n69%\nof CU members report poor financial health, which limits satisfaction even with institutions they trust more than banks.\nSatisfaction stays high, but financial stress holds back CU members.\nCredit unions continue to outperform retail banks in satisfaction across all categories, including trust and problem resolution. However, financially unhealthy members\u2014who now represent the majority of CU membership, at 69%\u2014report significantly lower satisfaction. This points to a widening engagement gap: Among healthy members, satisfaction scores average 788. Among financially unhealthy ones, the score drops to 702.\nDigital performance shows a similar split. While CU digital channels beat banks overall by 45 points, satisfaction with mobile apps is slipping due to unclear interfaces, limited features and navigation issues.\nCredit unions prioritize legacy upgrades as digital gaps widen.\nWhile most financial institutions (FIs) focus on enhancing consumer-facing technologies, credit unions have prioritized modernizing their core infrastructure. Nearly half cite legacy system upgrades as a top priority. Limited scale and funding delayed past investments, but that\u2019s changing fast. With engagement slipping among financially stressed members, catching up on foundational systems could be key to unlocking better digital experiences.\nPersonalized Service Can Set CUs Apart\nCredit unions win loyalty by offering more personalized service than banks. However, many members still feel disconnected, suggesting personalization efforts remain inconsistent.\nPersonal connections matter, but many CU members still feel unknown.\nCredit unions outperform national and online banks in forming personal connections\u2014but not by much. More than half (56%) of CU and community bank users still say they\u2019ve never had a true relationship with their provider, compared to 65% and 66% of national and online bank customers, respectively. That weakens a core strength of CUs and leaves room for others to compete on service. Members who feel disconnected are more likely to switch providers or underuse their services. CUs cannot rely on reputation alone\u2014personalization must reach each member, not just reflect the brand.\nCredit unions modernize with members and younger users in mind.\nCredit unions are updating legacy workflows to match rising member expectations. For example, Greater Nevada Credit Union (GNCU) streamlined its loan payments system after members voiced frustration, cutting call center load and boosting satisfaction through better user experience (UX) and integration.\nAt the same time, FinTech partnerships are helping CUs keep pace with digital-first habits. Younger consumers expect personalized tools\u2014powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and automation\u2014not just friendlier service.\nDigital personalization lags despite rising demand for tailored service.\nIn a recent survey, half of FI users said they\u2019d switch their primary institution for more personalized guidance. However, according to another study, few CUs have transformed key engagement tools. Chatbot and video agent upgrades remain limited, and AI personalization is rarely in place or even planned. As consumer expectations for these experiences rise, the gap between member needs and digital execution could quickly widen.\nBeyond feeling known, members want financial interactions that reflect their goals and context. Bridging that divide will take more than empathy\u2014it will require strategic, tech-enabled follow-through.\nInnovation Supports Members Facing Financial Stress\nCU members use cards to manage day-to-day essentials, creating key opportunities to boost their engagement. Innovation around rewards, financial wellness and mobile-first tools is helping credit unions support members under strain, but gaps remain.\nCU heritage and innovation converge to address modern financial stress.\nCredit unions were built to serve communities through trust, inclusion and support\u2014values no less relevant in today\u2019s market. Today\u2019s CU members don\u2019t lean on cards for extras. Instead, they rely on them to cover basics like groceries, rent and utilities for an average of 4.6 expense types, according to one PYMNTS Intelligence study. In fact, another study confirms that 63% of members use their CU-issued cards to purchase groceries, and 37% use them to cover utility bills. These purchasing patterns reflect household realities, and that makes card-based loyalty stickier. With more than half of CU consumer members saying that financial incentives and rewards are the most important factor when choosing a credit card, CUs have an opportunity to solidify engagement with their members by offering rewards for using their cards for these essential purchases.\nEven as members depend on their CUs for essential spending, many still find digital experiences lacking. While credit unions\u2019 digital channels score higher than banks\u2019 overall, satisfaction with CU mobile apps has declined significantly\u2014driven by unclear information, a limited range of services and poor navigation. Only 52% of CUs consider their digital member engagement mature, and just 45% have introduced financial wellness products and services in the past three years. Structured innovation pipelines\u2014member feedback, testing and iteration\u2014are becoming differentiators, especially for smaller CUs with limited internal capacity.\nCUs expand personalization with digital tools to grow savings and fund causes.\nTo illustrate, BrightStar Credit Union\u2019s new partnership with Spiral, announced in April, will let members round up purchases and automatically save the difference or donate it to charity. BrightStar\u2019s integration of Spiral\u2019s platform personalizes giving by letting users choose causes, track impact and receive donation reports. These features, available within members\u2019 digital banking experience, reflect a broader shift in CU strategy: meeting members\u2019 financial needs while deepening engagement through shared values and flexible digital tools.\nTech partnerships help smaller CUs modernize payments and card features.\nVelera\u2019s collaboration with Zelle shows how smaller institutions are scaling innovation. For example, Zelle integration gives minority depository institution (MDI) CUs access to fast, convenient peer-to-peer (P2P) payments\u2014features members increasingly expect. Meanwhile, Velera\u2019s new Card on File solution brings cardholder upgrades that support virtual provisioning and easier management of stored payment credentials at more than 115 merchants. These investments close the gap between what members want and what CUs can offer\u2014without requiring massive internal buildouts.\nDeepening Member Engagement Amid Financial Challenges\nCredit unions are built for moments like this\u2014when financial stress runs high, trust is scarce, and people need practical, human-focused support. However, legacy alone isn\u2019t a strategy. As member needs and expectations evolve, even the most mission-driven institutions must innovate faster and with more structure.\nTo achieve high satisfaction for all members, credit unions should consider the following strategies:\nBuild card programs that reward essential purchases and reflect real-world member needs.\nPrioritize digital tools that simplify onboarding, servicing and card management, especially across mobile experiences.\nScale financial wellness tools\u2014like budgeting and goal tracking\u2014that support members through economic volatility.\nSystematize member feedback and innovation testing to align digital upgrades with lived experiences.\nPartner with technology providers that speed time to market without compromising personalization.\nCredit unions don\u2019t need to abandon their values to compete. They simply need to operationalize them in ways that meet members where they are. By embedding empathy into digital tools, prioritizing essential card spending, and scaling financial wellness support, CUs can turn their mission into tangible value for members facing economic uncertainty. Doing so deepens engagement, sustains trust and empowers members to thrive\u2014no matter the economic climate.\nAbout\nVelera is the nation\u2019s premier payments credit union service organization (CUSO) and an integrated financial technology solutions provider.

      "text": "America\u2019s banks are under siege, and the enemy is invisible. Authentication-based fraud is skyrocketing, leaving financial institutions scrambling to fight back against an epidemic of stolen identities, hacked passwords and unauthorized transactions.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cTo Stamp Out Authentication-Based Fraud, Banks Want Metal Cards,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence and Arculus collaboration, which revealed that a staggering 87% of banks have reported an increase in credential-based fraud.\nAs the level of sophistication available to bad actors grows, hackers and fraudsters are exploiting every vulnerability in password-based authentication. This can frequently mean banks are left playing catch-up.\nThe problem is simple: passwords are obsolete. Cybercriminals, armed with stolen credentials from countless data breaches, are gaining access to customers\u2019 accounts with disturbing ease. Phishing scams, social engineering and credential stuffing attacks are running rampant. In some cases, criminals don\u2019t even need to steal a physical card to drain an account, they just need a victim\u2019s login details.\nEnter metal payment cards, which are being positioned as the latest weapon in banks\u2019 ongoing arms race against fraudsters.\nBanks Battle Fraud Surge With Next-Gen Metal Cards\nMetal bank cards aren\u2019t just sleek, status-symbol cards reserved for the ultra-wealthy. The new generation of metal cards feature built-in biometric authentication and tap-to-verify technology, allowing users to approve transactions in real time. Think of it as two-factor authentication, but without the hassle of one-time codes or easily hackable passwords.\nAccording to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, 77% of surveyed financial institutions are considering solutions like tap-to-authenticate as a powerful new layer of security.\nThe appeal is clear: Rather than relying on an easily stolen PIN or a hacker-breached password, customers will verify transactions with a physical card that requires their presence to function. After all, metal cards with authentication technology can act as a hard stop to many types of credential-based fraud. This added layer of security helps make it nearly impossible for cybercriminals to execute fraudulent logins or unauthorized transactions.\nAfter all, the fight against fraud is turning into an arms race. As criminals develop more advanced hacking techniques, banks are under increasing pressure to innovate or suffer the consequences. Metal authentication cards and passwordless banking may be the only way forward in an era where passwords are more of a liability than a security measure.\nAs the financial industry races toward a future without passwords, security experts warn that speed is crucial. The faster banks move, the harder it will be for fraudsters to adapt and exploit new vulnerabilities.\nRead more: Banks Step Up the Fight Against Stolen Credentials\nBanks Are Putting the Pedal to the Metal on Security\nPYMNTS Intelligence data finds that more banks prefer metal cards for tap-to-authenticate technology (41%) compared to plastic for the same use (25%). Banks more affected by fraud tend to have a stronger interest in metal cards and anticipate better impacts from adopting the technology.\nLarger institutions drive adoption, with 69% of banks with over $100 billion in assets expressing a strong level of interest in metal cards. Add in the 23% of somewhat interested large banks, and the pool of large banks interested in metal payment cards grows to 92%.\nCustomers expect seamless and secure banking experiences, and delaying the move away from passwords could leave institutions lagging behind competitors that offer smoother, safer digital interactions. By proactively adopting cutting-edge security measures, banks not only protect their customers but also establish themselves as leaders in the industry.\nThe bottom line? If banks want to keep their customers safe, the days of relying on passwords are over. And for criminals hoping to exploit outdated security measures? Your time is up."

      "text": "The payments landscape is more sophisticated than ever, but so are fraudsters.\nWith financial institutions (FIs) deploying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and other cutting-edge technologies to secure transactions, cybercriminals are increasingly finding that the easiest way in is through the weakest link: people.\nA new Fraud and Financial Crimes report from PYMNTS Intelligence reveals that, from social engineering to insider threats, the human element can often be the most vulnerable yet potentially under-addressed aspect of the scam landscape.\nThe report data found that approximately 30% of U.S. consumers \u2014 roughly 77 million individuals \u2014 have fallen victim to financial scams in the past five years, with losses often exceeding $500 and, in many cases, much more. Scammers have adopted strategies akin to those used by legitimate businesses, such as segmenting their \u201cmarket\u201d and personalizing their \u201coffers\u201d to align with the specific fears, aspirations or daily habits of their targets.\nAs fraud tactics evolve, FIs are in turn prioritizing educating their customers alongside digital defenses. By fortifying employees, customers and partners against manipulation and error, institutions can work to better neutralize many of the human-level threats that deploying technology alone cannot.\nRead more: New Report Examines the Slick New Face of Digital Fraud\nThe Human Factor in Fraud Is a Persistent Weakness\nPhishing, vishing, business email compromise (BEC) and other social engineering attacks rely on psychological manipulation rather than technological vulnerabilities. Criminals no longer need to crack complex encryption algorithms or breach fortified systems; instead, they trick individuals. Even the most advanced fraud detection models struggle to identify threats that originate from genuine user actions.\nThe report found that by posing as representatives from financial institutions, technical support or government agencies, scammers are able to establish credibility and lower the defenses of potential victims, gaining trust quickly.\nFor example, scammers posing as trusted entities such as employers are particularly effective in job listing scams. Eighty-six percent of victims reported that the scammer used this tactic. Similarly, 83% of debt collection scam victims reported that scammers pretended to be a trusted entity.\nIf fraudsters are targeting people, then financial institutions can in turn play a proactive role in protecting them from scams. By understanding the tailored strategies scammers use, FIs can implement more effective measures to safeguard their customers while prioritizing security strategies that fortify human awareness, behavior and decision-making.\nSee also: Behavioral Analytics Inject \u2018Smart Friction\u2019 Into Battle Against Scams and Payments Fraud\nLive phishing simulations, gamified security challenges and adaptive learning platforms can each teach employees and customers to recognize and resist social engineering attempts. Training can also incorporate emerging threats such as deepfake fraud, which uses AI-generated synthetic voices and images to impersonate individuals in positions of authority.\nAI-driven chatbots, real-time fraud alerts and personalized security insights can also help in educating FI customers around ways to potentially identify and avoid scams. For example, before completing a high-risk transfer or initiating a new irrevocable payment, a system can display a targeted warning message based on real-world scam tactics.\nQuestions regarding whether customers want to proceed with transactions and whether they truly \u201cknow\u201d recipients can keep individuals safe from an \u201curgency trap\u201d that scammers love to set, pressuring would-be victims to hurry up and send money or account details, Gasan Awad, senior vice president of enterprise fraud product management at PNC, told PYMNTS.\nPartnering with other financial entities and law enforcement agencies can also facilitate the sharing of information about emerging scam trends, ultimately enhancing the overall defense against fraud.\nThrough continuous education, advanced technological defenses and collaborative efforts, the financial industry can better protect consumers from falling victim to these deceptive schemes. By making the human element a priority, financial institutions can turn their weakest link into a formidable line of defense against ever-evolving threats.\nRead the report: How Scammers Tailor Financial Scams to Individual Consumer Vulnerabilities"

      "text": "But the information also details pressures on consumers navigating a balancing act in terms of spending and saving: While incomes, and particularly disposable income, are on the rise, spending is outpacing that gain. But when adjusting for inflation, there\u2019s actually been a paring back of spending; not a decline, but a deceleration.\nEstimates released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reveal personal incomes increased 0.4% at a seasonally adjusted monthly rate in July, accelerating from the 0.3% gain recorded in June. Disposable personal income, i.e. less personal current taxes, also rose 0.4%, also improving from last month\u2019s 0.3% pace.\nWages are Trending Up\nThe July increase in personal income was driven mainly by wages and salaries. Private wages and salaries grew 0.6% and accounted for 74% of the overall gains in the period.\nPersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) expanded 0.5% in July, outpacing the growth in disposable income. Services accounted for a $60.2 billion increase, while goods added $48.7 billion. Yet, goods expenditures, particularly durables, accelerated relative to June, growing by 0.8% (1.9% for durables) after a 0.4 % rise in the month prior (-0.8% for durables).\nThe PCE price index, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, increased 0.2% in July and 2.6% year-over-year, unchanged from June\u2019s 12-month rate. Prices for services have grown much faster than those of goods over the past year, at a pace of 3.6% versus 0.5% for the former. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% in July and 2.9% from one year ago, slightly faster than June\u2019s 2.8% pace.\nWhen netting out the effect of higher prices, the trend in recent months is of decelerating expenditures, close to leveling up, with the pace of income increases, which means that the \u201cgap\u201d between the two metrics is not as wide as it once was, and thus households are taking at least some steps to conserve cash.\nNarrowing the Gap\nOver the last 12 months, personal consumption expenditures have increased 2.1% in real terms, while disposable personal income has risen by 2%. July marked the seventh consecutive month in which real expenditure growth outpaced income growth on a yearlong perspective, although the gap has narrowed: consumption grew 2.2% in June while disposable income grew 1.7%. The same registers were seen in May.\nThe personal saving rate, or personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income, stood at 4.4% in July, unchanged from June. The path of the savings rate may prove indicative of the state of consumer worries: it stands below the April peak (5%), but above December\u2019s 3.5% level.\nThe move to save comes against a backdrop where, as we reported earlier this week, inflation expectations rose for the first time in three months during the same month reflected in the PCE data. Inflation expectations as estimated by the Conference Board climbed to 6.2% from 5.7% in July, but below April\u2019s peak of 7%. Concerns about tariffs and high prices, especially for food and groceries, intensified.\nAnd on Friday (Aug. 29), University of Michigan released the final data for their August Consumer Sentiment Survey, confirming a decline in sentiment of 5.7% as measured this month from July. The August decrease was pervasive across income and age groups. Sentiment now stands 14% below its own standing a year prior. Year-ahead inflation expectations moved up again after two consecutive drops, from 4.5% last month to 4.8% this month."

      "text": "But on Thursday morning\u2019s (July 17) second quarter 2025 investor earnings call, the Minneapolis-based financial institution\u2019s executives stressed to investors that they was doubling down on embedded payments, blockchain and AI-infused infrastructure.\nThe earnings report tell a story that diverges depending on which lens you apply. On paper, it was a solid performance: net income rose 13.2% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, with diluted earnings per share climbing to $1.11 from $0.97 a year ago. Fee income grew 4.6%, helped by strong showings in payments and investment services, and return on tangible common equity hit an impressive 18%.\n\u201cOur fee growth was led by payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and treasury management fees, which benefited from greater interconnectedness across the franchise and self-funded investments in our organic growth,\u201d said Gunjan Kedia, president and CEO of U.S. Bancorp.\nBut the market reacted coolly. Revenue and net interest income came in soft, with Kedia guiding toward a more cautious Q3 \u2014 highlighting macroeconomic headwinds and deposit competition. Shares dipped following the report, as analysts zoomed in on what wasn\u2019t growing fast enough.\nAt the same time, U.S. Bancorp is fast-tracking a series of ambitious innovations that are reshaping how banks deliver value in an era of platform-first ecosystems and real-time finance.\nSee also: Inside U.S. Bank\u2019s Push to Simplify Global Payments in an Era of \u2018Co-opetition\u2019\nPayments at the Core of Growth\nMuch of U.S. Bank\u2019s strategy for repositioning itself as an infrastructure bank for the digital economy hinges on Elavon, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s merchant services subsidiary. In June, Elavon jumped two spots in the Nilson Report rankings to become the fifth-largest U.S. merchant acquirer, now processing over $576 billion annually.\nMore notably, it\u2019s now the second-largest bank-owned processor of Visa and Mastercard payments \u2014 a testament to how deep U.S. Bank has embedded itself in the payment plumbing of modern commerce.\n\u201cPayments isn\u2019t just a product anymore \u2014 it\u2019s a platform,\u201d Kedia said during the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing success in linking our treasury, card and acquiring capabilities into one digital framework for businesses.\nThat platform-centric vision is showing up in Elavon\u2019s new embedded payment suite, launched this quarter. Designed for seamless integration into enterprise software, eCommerce systems and FinTech stacks, the suite allows developers to bake secure, scalable transaction capabilities into apps and workflows \u2014 whether in retail, healthcare, hospitality or beyond.\nIt\u2019s a decisive shift from being a back-office processor to becoming a front-end enabler of commerce. And while competitors like Stripe and Square often dominate the headlines, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s bank-backed advantage allows it to offer more cohesive financial service layers, from underwriting and settlement to compliance.\nRelated: U.S. Bank Focuses on \u2018Totality of the Customer\u2019\nRebuilding the Tech Stack\nDriving all of this is a deeper, less visible shift: the modernization of U.S. Bancorp\u2019s infrastructure.\nTechnology and communications expenses rose 4.9% year-over-year this quarter, reaching $534 million. While higher costs might spook some investors, the spend reflects a deliberate strategy to build a tech stack capable of supporting AI-driven insights, real-time payments and embedded finance.\nIt\u2019s showing in how U.S. Bank is consolidating its card issuance platform with Fiserv\u2019s Credit Choice, an integrated solution for consumer and small business cards. Once complete, it will allow partner banks to offer digital-first credit cards that customers can manage alongside debit cards within a unified interface. That kind of experience design, rare among traditional banks, is increasingly table stakes in a world of FinTech-native expectations.\nInternally, U.S. Bancorp has also focused on refining automation, data architecture and cybersecurity controls \u2014 elements that aren\u2019t flashy but are foundational to scaling digital products with integrity.\nIn many ways, the company is sketching a blueprint for a financial institution that doesn\u2019t just digitize banking, but embeds banking into everything else. It\u2019s a subtle but seismic shift \u2014 from offering products, to offering platforms; from being a service provider, to being an infrastructure partner.\nThat model is especially relevant in an economy where finance is increasingly API-based, modular and woven into SaaS, marketplaces and mobile ecosystems. U.S. Bancorp is betting that the future of banking won\u2019t be in branches or balance sheet spread \u2014 but in the software behind your favorite app."

      "text": "Banks say they fear fraud on real-time payment rails. The numbers say they shouldn\u2019t.\nThe August 2025 report, \u201cFact vs. Fiction in Real-Time Payments Fraud,\u201d published by PYMNTS Intelligence and The Clearing House, gives rise to a striking contradiction: financial institutions are disproportionately worried about fraud risks in real-time payments, even as those same rails show the lowest fraud rates in the industry.\nFraud Concerns and Receive-Only Mode\nThat fear is shaping decisions at the infrastructure level. According to the report, 78% of organizations choose to start their real-time implementation in receive-only mode, a risk-avoidance strategy that limits the value of faster payments and stalls ecosystem-wide adoption.\nBut the data undermines the fear. Fraud is happening, but not where banks expect it.\nThe headline findings from the report are familiar. Real-time payments are gaining ground, but adoption is hindered by persistent myths. The RTP network and FedNow Service, the two primary real-time rails in the U.S., are designed with built-in fraud mitigation tools \u2014 yet only 22% of banks have embraced full send-and-receive functionality.\nThe report makes the case that security fears are less a reflection of actual threats and more a legacy mindset carried over from fraud-prone systems like checks and wires.\nWhat\u2019s buried beneath the top-line summary, however, is this:\n- Just 2% of firms reported any fraud on RTP or FedNow. In contrast, a staggering 63% of firms reported check fraud in 2024, while ACH and wire transfers saw fraud rates of 38% and 30%, respectively.\n- Only 3% of financial institutions characterized real-time fraud as \u201csignificant.\u201d Most categorized the fraud impact as either \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cslight\u201d\u2014and a large portion reported no impact at all.\n- Despite these numbers, 85% of U.S. payment professionals still expect fraud to rise with real-time payments. Among large institutions (50,000+ employees), that expectation climbs to 95%, with half anticipating a sharp increase.\nThe discrepancy isn\u2019t just academic. It has market consequences. Institutions are over-indexing on risk and under-leveraging one of the industry\u2019s most secure payment systems. The irony is stark: checks remain in use by 75% of firms despite being the most fraud-prone instrument.\nMeanwhile, real-time systems \u2014 designed with push-only architecture, API-level security, and instant transaction visibility \u2014 are still eyed with suspicion.\nPart of the problem may be optics. Fraud that does occur on real-time rails \u2014 such as authorized push payment (APP) scams \u2014 tends to make headlines, while the day-to-day security wins go unnoticed. Still, tools like Confirmation of Payee (CoP) have near-universal support (96% of banks) and have already cut fraud 60% in the U.K. market. In the U.S., however, partial adoption risks rerouting fraud to less protected institutions.\nMaking the Case for Real Time\nOther findings in the report further reinforce the case for real-time rails. The Clearing House and the Fed continue to expand fraud defenses with tools like real-time monitoring, collaborative data exchange, and scam classification models. Banks themselves are prioritizing AI, multifactor authentication, and interbank data sharing to further reduce risk. Yet without broader adoption, those efforts risk being underutilized.\nThe path forward doesn\u2019t require new tech; it requires a mindset shift. The report offers ample evidence that the real-time rails are ready. Now it\u2019s time for institutions to catch up."

      "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven conversational solutions built atop personalization is becoming a new tool for banks to drive customer engagement.\nFindings in the June 2025 Embedded Finance Tracker\u00ae Series report, \u201cBeyond the Bot: Why Embedded Conversational AI Is Banking\u2019s Next Strategic Advantage,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence collaboration with Galileo, spotlights that nearly three-fourths (72%) of customers say personalization influences where they bank.\nIn the age of digital banking, this means the most powerful transaction might not be a payment or a loan but a simple question. \u201cCan you help me increase my credit limit?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s this charge on my account?\u201d \u201cHow much can I safely spend this month?\u201d\nFor decades, questions like these were routed to call centers and logged \u2014 if at all \u2014 as afterthoughts.\nBut a growing cohort of banks and financial institutions are rethinking the value of customer dialogue. With conversational AI now capable of much more than deflecting calls, financial services are beginning to treat conversation itself as a high-value asset: a gateway to data, engagement, and ultimately, revenue.\nFrom Call Deflection to Value Direction\nFor much of the last decade, conversational AI in banking has been synonymous with cost savings. The early chatbot revolution was led by virtual agents designed to reduce call center load and improve response time. But as AI has evolved scripted bots into dynamic, context-aware assistants, and its role has shifted from reactive support to proactive value creation.\nWhat\u2019s changed is the capability of conversational systems. Instead of handling only scripted queries, modern AI-driven interfaces \u2014 enabled by advances in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) \u2014 can now recognize intent, provide context-aware responses and execute tasks across banking workflows. When deeply integrated into digital ecosystems, they can shape the entire customer journey.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report found that institutions from JPMorgan Chase to SoFi are embedding conversational AI within their digital ecosystems to drive transactions, gather behavioral data and nudge customers toward higher-value services. By turning everyday queries into actionable insight, banks are monetizing moments that once disappeared into customer service queues.\nThese capabilities reflect a broader shift in how financial institutions view conversational AI as a strategic touchpoint for engagement and revenue generation.\nRead the report: Beyond the Bot: Why Embedded Conversational AI Is Banking\u2019s Next Strategic Advantage\nConversations as Behavioral Data Engines\nA key reason for this shift is the rich behavioral data embedded in user interactions. Unlike traditional interfaces, conversational systems offer a high signal-to-noise ratio. Each query provides insight into user intent, context, preferences and urgency \u2014 information that\u2019s often missing from static clickstreams.\nBanks are increasingly leveraging this data to refine customer segmentation, personalize offers and prioritize outreach.\nThe shift to embedded AI isn\u2019t just about modernizing support \u2014 it\u2019s about redefining the digital bank branch.\nApps and portals are being redesigned around \u201cchat-first\u201d experiences \u2014 where conversational entry points act as the user\u2019s primary navigation tool. This model replaces static menus with dynamic dialogue, enabling customers to express their goals in natural language (\u201cI want to save for a house,\u201d \u201cShow me my subscriptions,\u201d etc.) and receive tailored responses that link to relevant services or tools.\nAs conversational systems become smarter, more contextual and more tightly integrated into banking workflows, they offer a rare convergence of user experience and monetization. For legacy institutions racing to keep pace with agile FinTechs, the ability to turn dialogue into data \u2014 and data into dollars \u2014 may be the most valuable upgrade of all."

      "text": "Fraud is getting more sophisticated, thanks to artificial intelligence (AI).\nFraud can be perpetrated in the form of deepfake videos or voice, with AI producing a clone of a family relative supposedly in an emergency and needs a cash transfer immediately. AI can write more convincing phishing emails, removing telltale signs such as broken English. AI can also fake images like a driver\u2019s license to fool and scam people, according to an FBI report.\n\u201cFraud is only going to get worse with the creation of generative AI,\u201d said Mike de Vere, CEO of Zest AI, which leverages AI to help financial services firms make more informed lending decisions and mitigate fraud incidents.\nAccording to a March 2025 report from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the amount of losses due to fraud hit $12.5 billion in 2024, up 25% from the prior year. More people also reported they lost money due to fraud: 38% last year compared to 27% in 2023.\nInvestment scams led people to lose the most money, totaling $5.7 billion, up 24% from the year before. The second highest were imposter scams, at $2.95 billion. However, imposter scams were the most commonly reported fraud, with online shopping fraud next.\nNotably, consumers lost more money to scams through bank transfers or cryptocurrency than all other payment methods combined, the FTC said.\nAccording to a PYMNTS Intelligence study in partnership with i2c, 28% of consumers have fallen victim to credit card fraud last year. Moreover, 37% said they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about falling victim to such fraud, according to \u201cConsumer Credit Economy: Credit Card Fraud.\u201d\nIn an interview with PYMNTS, de Vere said fraud losses are projected to reach $40 billion by 2027. Fraud tools are becoming more accessible, he added, noting that for as little as $20, criminals can do things like create fake IDs and pay stubs.\nRead more: 37% of Consumers Highly Concerned About Credit Card Fraud\nWhat Financial Institutions Wrongly Believe\nBased on his experience working with banks and credit unions, de Vere shared his insights on five myths about fraud prevention that could leave organizations vulnerable.\nMyth 1: Small Banks Are Safe Against Fraud\nThe first misconception is that fraudsters only target major financial institutions. In reality, 8 out of 10 banks and credit unions, including smaller ones, reported fraud losses exceeding $500,000 last year.\n\u201cIt disproportionately impacts smaller financial institutions,\u201d de Vere said. \u201cA fraudster going up against Citi\u2019s IT team is probably going to be less successful than [targeting] a tiny credit union that outsources their IT.\u201d\nMyth 2: Transaction Monitoring Is Enough\nMany institutions believe that monitoring individual transactions provides adequate fraud prevention protection. For example, looking at a customer\u2019s credit card patterns to spot whether there\u2019s a fraudulent purchase.\nHowever, de Vere said this narrow approach misses the broader behavioral patterns that AI can detect. He shared this real-world example: A fraudster opened a credit card at a credit union, charging about $100 a month and paying it off regularly. By itself, this behavior doesn\u2019t raise red flags. However, this criminal was doing the same thing at several credit unions, de Vere said. The individual eventually applied for and received personal loans, maxed out the credit cards and disappeared with the money.\nMyth 3: Security Requires Friction\nThe third myth revolves around the idea that to be secure, a financial institution has to put the customer through several hoops such as asking for the answer to a security question and the like. It creates friction in the customer experience. These binary fraud systems \u2014 is it a fraud or not? Yes or no \u2014 can create problems unnecessarily, de Vere said.\nHe shared his personal experience of being flagged for ID fraud during an auto loan application simply because his last name was squished together. \u201cAn AI solution could have looked at my credit report and seen that \u2026 two of my credit cards actually have my last name smashed together, so it\u2019s probably not likely that I\u2019m a fraudster.\u201d\nMyth 4: Manual Reviews Catch Fraud\nHumans are supposed to be the gold standard when it comes to catching fraud, but de Vere argued that they are only as good as their experiences. Moreover, manual reviews are limited by the reviewer\u2019s experience within an institution.\nIn contrast, an AI model can consume trillions of points of data to identify patterns of fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s so far beyond where a human can be,\u201d de Vere said.\nMyth 5: All Fraud Solutions Are Equal\nThe final myth is that fraud prevention solutions are interchangeable. De Vere said that many available solutions are incomplete, creating blind spots in security coverage.\nHe said a robust fraud prevention solution should offer probability scores rather than binary \u201cfraud/no-fraud\u201d decisions, be trained on comprehensive datasets and tailored to an organization\u2019s needs and geographic location. This approach lets organizations identify local fraud rings and deploy appropriate security measures.\nAdvocatong for a collaborative approach to fighting fraud, de Vere said, \u201cWe need to be thinking less about it being a competitive issue and more about it being a collaborative issue.\u201d\nTo that end, Zest AI has created a consortium to share fraud experiences, enabling AI models to learn from attacks on one institution to protect others in the same ecosystem.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "Whether it\u2019s a payroll deposit, an insurance payout or a merchant refund, waiting days for money now feels out of step with everyday life.\nThat expectation is reshaping how banks and credit unions approach instant payments. The PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cDoubling Down: The Growing Case for Multi-Rail Real-Time Payments,\u201d a collaboration with The Clearing House, finds that reliability is as important as speed, and multi-rail strategies are fast becoming the standard to ensure both.\nConsumers Lean Into Instant Disbursements\nThe scale of consumer demand is hard to overstate. Nine in 10 consumers in the United States say they would prefer to receive payouts instantly if given the choice, the report reveals.\nWhen they do, satisfaction soars. The report finds that 94% of those who accessed instant disbursements say they are highly satisfied with the experience, compared to 80% for those without that option. These numbers illustrate why banks are investing in instant payments infrastructure, not as a nice-to-have but as a critical customer experience driver.\nThe frequency of payouts further underscores the point. From gig economy wages to government benefits and insurance settlements, U.S. consumers encounter situations every month where a real-time option is not only preferable but often expected. Institutions that fail to deliver always-on accessibility risk losing trust in moments that matter most.\n- The report finds that 90% of consumers prioritize instant disbursements when available, with reported satisfaction higher than with delayed payment methods. Providing resilient access can transform how consumers perceive their bank or credit union.\n- With 58% of U.S. financial institutions now connecting to both the RTP\u00ae network and the FedNow\u00ae Service, multi-rail strategies are becoming the default approach. The ability to reroute transactions when one rail experiences a disruption creates the always-available performance consumers now expect.\n- The RTP network, with a $10 million transaction cap, supports high-value payments and larger banks. FedNow, which raised its limit to $1 million over the summer, is positioned to better serve a broad base of institutions. With both rail options in play, financial institutions can adapt in real time to serve diverse use cases across consumer and business segments.\nA Strategy Built for the Always-On Consumer\nFinancial institutions once hesitated to commit to a single real-time rail, preferring to wait for a market leader to emerge. That hesitation is quickly fading. A year ago, nearly one-third of banks said choosing between RTP and FedNow was a key barrier to adoption. Today, 17% see the choice as an obstacle, underscoring a growing consensus that \u201cboth\u201d is the right answer.\nWhat\u2019s driving this shift is resilience. Downtime is no longer acceptable when consumers expect to see incoming funds in seconds, not hours. A multi-rail strategy ensures that institutions can offer reliable, seamless disbursements, whether it\u2019s a Saturday evening or a weekday morning. That dependability not only reduces operational risks but also reinforces consumer trust in the financial system.\nAdopting both RTP and FedNow also extends reach. RTP processes over 1.2 million payments daily, which demonstrates maturity, while FedNow\u2019s rapid market penetration empowers regional banks and credit unions with greater real-time capabilities. By covering both, financial institutions can serve corporate clients requiring high-value transactions as well as consumers expecting instant transfers for everyday scenarios.\nLooking ahead, institutions that invest in dual rail capabilities now are best positioned to compete in a payments landscape defined by speed, safety and reliability. Building resilience around consumer expectations for always-on service transforms instant payments from an innovation into infrastructure, an essential utility of modern financial life."
