  "content": "I initially wrote about Elastic (NYSE: ESTC ) in September, last year, when the stock was at ~$76.4. With 14% FY'25 expected revenue growth, increasing margins and an estimated base-case Fair Value around $95, I saw it at the edge between \"Hold\" and \"Buy\". I initiated\n\n\"Fundamental Options\" would be the title of my investing style, because I combine fundamental analysis with the power of options. I use Fundamental Analysis to quantitatively and qualitatively assess individual stocks and ETFs, and I pursue various strategies: Income oriented, especially BDCs, but also Utilities; Growth At A Reasonable Price, especially Tech, having a background in Software Development; Deep Value, based on Discounted Cash Flow and / or other industry specific valuation methods; Dividend Aristocrats.While I usually invest in stocks for long-term, I also have 20-25 strategies involving options that I use for various purposes: hedging stocks; bullish stock / ETF substitutes with improved risk / reward; neutral trades; trading volatility; earnings-related trades.Teaching is another passion of mine, I used to be a formal on non-formal teacher or coach in different areas of life, including authoring of a free local investing newsletter in the last years.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Disclosure:I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of ESTC either through stock ownership, options, or other derivatives.
