  "title": "Why Nvidia Matters More To Markets Than The Fed",
  "description": "Options traders are betting Powell's comments will move the market up or down by 0.8 percentage points while Nvidia's q2 2026 results could move the market 0.9 points.",
  "content": "Markets move on gaps between reality and expectations. I expect the gap that could emerge after Nvidia reports second-quarter earnings next Wednesday will move markets more than whatever Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nHow so? Investors are growing worried about how much companies are investing in artificial intelligence and how few of them are getting a payoff. Unless Nvidia beats investor expectations and raises guidance, its stock could plunge. This drop would be exacerbated by investors who view the bad report as a sign the AI bubble is bursting\n\nBy contrast, what Powell will say Friday is subject to less surprise. Since he has proven himself to be more loyal to Fed independence than to President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to force him to lower rates, I am expecting Powell to say something along these lines: inflation could rise due to tariffs and unemployment is low so there is no reason to cut rates.\n\nRead on for a closer look at why Nvidia is so market moving and how investors will know whether the AI chip designer will beat and raise.\n\nWhy Nvidia Is So Important To The Market\n\nNvidia\u2019s quarterly earnings reports have been market moving events since May 2023 when the chip designer issued the revenue growth forecast heard around the world \u2013 prompting me to write my latest book, Brain Rush.\n\nSince then Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization has grown so much that changes in the company\u2019s stock price drive the S&P 500. Indeed, the AI chip designer\u2019s $4 trillion stock market capitalization, accounts for 8% of the value of the index, according to the New York Times.\n\nMoreover, the options market is expecting Nvidia\u2019s earnings report to move markets more than Powell\u2019s remarks. That\u2019s because S&P 500 options are pricing a 0.8 percentage point move up or down after the Fed Chair speaks \u2013 whereas prices for August 28 \u2013 the first chance for investors to trade on Nvidia\u2019s report \u2013 imply a move of 0.9 percentage points up or down, reported the Times.\n\nWhat Investors Expect From Nvidia\u2019s Second Quarter Report\n\nIn the last few weeks, investors have grown more skeptical of investing in AI companies. For example, Palantir \u2013 whose shares peaked a few weeks ago at $190 \u2013 have recently lost 20% of their value despite an excellent second quarter financial report, as I wrote in an August 20 Forbes post.\n\nOne reason for the drop \u2013 which was primarily due to a short seller\u2019s estimate the stock is 74% overvalued \u2013 is the abysmal payoff from companies\u2019 investments in AI.\n\nLast September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app \u2013 akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe.\n\nThis week, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. \"Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return,\" according to a study \u2013 based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments \u2013 from MIT\u2019s NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha.\n\nWill investors be worried this minimal payoff from AI will cause Nvidia to offer a less bullish growth forecast? If they do, Nvidia\u2019s stock could fall and drive a significant tech selloff.\n\nThis brings us to the question of what Nvidia is likely to say next Wednesday when it provides investors with its second quarter report. In May, the company forecast $45 billion in revenue for the second quarter \u2013 $920 million below investor expectations \u2013 but 50% higher than last year, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\nA week before the report, investors are expecting more from Nvidia. Specifically, analysts expect Nvidia to post revenue of $45.65 billion \u2013 a 52.4% increase from last year and a 47% boost in earnings per share to $1.00, according to MarketBeat. Investors are expecting Nvidia to forecast Q3 2026 revenue of $52.5 billion, according to The Motley Fool.\n\nIf Nvidia exceeds these expectations and raises revenue guidance, its shares will likely rise. Otherwise, the drop in Nvidia could cascade to other AI stocks. Meanwhile, I anticipate a much more muted reaction to whatever Powell says Friday.",

      "text": "Palantir stock has recently shed 20% since peaking at $190 a share earlier this month, according to Google Finance.\nDoes this make Palantir a bargain? Despite a strong second quarter financial report featuring expectations-beating growth and a bullish outlook, there are many reasons to expect the stock to decline further:\n- A short seller called Palantir 74% overvalued.\n- Palantir\u2019s CEO has sold significant holdings.\n- The lack of payoff from AI has investors concerned about an AI bubble.\nTo overcome these challenges, Palantir must grow faster by persuading more companies to adopt its platform. That could be difficult because the company\u2019s culture is rooted in the defense and intelligence sectors, noted Erika Barker. Enterprises may prefer to buy from more culturally-aligned rivals such as Microsoft and Databricks which offer simpler, more accessible platforms, Medium reported.\nPalantir is bullish about the future. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to grow our revenue \u2026 while decreasing our number of people,\u201d Palantir CEO Alex Karp told CNBC. \u201cThis is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.\u201d\nI have contacted Palantir to request comment and will update this post if I receive a response.\nPalantir\u2019s Second Quarter Performance And Prospects\nPalantir stock peaked days after the company reported second quarter results \u2013 which exceeded investor expectations and featured an increase in the company\u2019s forecast for the current quarter, according to CNBC.\nPalantir\u2019s revenue and profit were up sharply in the second quarter. Revenue jumped 48% to $1 billion \u2013 $60 million more than the LSEG consensus. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s net income soared 144% to $327 million \u2013 yielding an impressive net margin of 32.6%, CNBC reported.\nPalantir\u2019s guidance for the third quarter was ahead of estimates. The Denver-based software analytics company estimated revenue in a range \u2013 the midpoint of which is $1.085 billion \u2013 $102 million more than the analysts consensus, according to CNBC.\nDemand for Palantir\u2019s services appears strong. The total value of the company\u2019s contracts grew 140% to $2.27 billion and in July, the U.S. Army signed a $10 billion software and data contract with Palantir, wrote CNBC.\nArtificial intelligence has helped propel this growth. \u201cIt has been a steep and upward climb \u2014 an ascent that is a reflection of the remarkable confluence of the arrival of language models, the chips necessary to power them, and our software infrastructure,\u201d Karp wrote in a letter to shareholders.\nShort Seller Report Concluding Palantir Stock Is Overvalued\nAnalyst opinion is divided on Palantir\u2019s prospects. But short-seller Citron Research is extremely bearish \u2013 seeing Palantir\u2019s shares as 74% overvalued.\nWedbush is a Palantir bull. \u201cPalantir remains one of our top tech names to own in 2025 and this deal represents another opportunity for PLTR to capitalize on while continuing to generate unprecedented traction for its entire portfolio across the federal and commercial landscapes,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an August 4 note to investors featured by CNBC.\nRBC considered the stock very pricey before the Q2 earnings release. \u201cWe cannot rationalize why Palantir is the most expensive name in our software coverage,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAbsent a substantial beat-and-raise quarter elevating the near-term growth trajectory, valuation seems unsustainable.\u201d\nOn August 18, Citron Research \u2013 which recently initiated a short position \u2013 declared Palantir\u2019s stock worth $40.12 a share. In the report, short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research shared his belief that the stock --which sports a price-to-revenue multiple of about 114, according to GuruFocus \u2013 has become \u201cdetached from fundamentals,\u201d reported Investopedia.\nCitron\u2019s report arrived at this conclusion by comparing Palantir to OpenAI. Based on Bloomberg consensus projections, if Palantir was trading at 17 \u2013 the same price-to-revenue multiple as the ChatGPT maker \u2013 Palantir stock would trade closer to $40, noted Investopedia. However, \u201ceven that price would leave Palantir among the most expensive software as a service names names in history,\u201d noted Left.\nPalantir Insider Stock Sales\nPalantir\u2019s insider stock sales could also be contributing to investor nervousness. Karp has sold over $2 billion worth of stock in 2024 and 2025, representing 21% of his total holdings, noted Yahoo!Finance.\nThis contrasts with other tech CEOs such as Elon Musk, who bought Tesla stock during its rise. Karp\u2019s selling continues under 10b5-1 plans \u2013 he is authorized to sell as many as 9.975 million additional shares, reported Yahoo!Finance.\nInvestor Nervousness About AI Bubble\nLast September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app \u2013 akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe.\nThis week, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. \"Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return,\" according to a study \u2013 based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments \u2013 from MIT\u2019s NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha.\nThe main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. \"Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact,\" noted the MIT NANDA Institute report.\nDo enterprises failure to earn a return on their investment in generative AI bode poorly for Palantir\u2019s future? It is possible companies will stop investing so much in AI if they don\u2019t get better at integrating AI into their operations.\nBut I think the key is for companies to find ways to use AI to create new growth curves \u2013 something Palantir has succeeded in doing, I wrote in a Forbes post in February.\nIronically, Palantir\u2019s ability to grow into its high valuation depends on being able to sell more services to enterprises \u2013 which have yet to find AI\u2019s killer app. What\u2019s more, such companies may find rivals like Databricks and Snowflake to be a better fit \u2013 which could be profitable for Citron Research\u2019s short position in Palantir."

      "text": "Artificial intelligence kingpin Nvidia (NVDA) late Wednesday beat Wall Street's lowered targets for its fiscal first quarter but its sales guidance for the current period was below views. Still, Nvidia stock rose in extended trading.\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted 81 cents a share on sales of $44.06 billion in the quarter ended April 27. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Nvidia to earn an adjusted 73 cents a share on sales of $43.34 billion in fiscal Q1. In the year-earlier period, Nvidia earned an adjusted 61 cents a share on sales of $26.04 billion.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia forecast revenue of $45 billion, vs. expectations for $45.92 billion. In the same quarter last year, Nvidia posted sales of $30.04 billion.\nIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock climbed more than 2% to 138.19. During the regular session Wednesday, Nvidia stock dipped 0.5% to close at 134.81.\nLast month, Nvidia warned that it would take a charge of \"up to approximately $5.5 billion\" for H20 inventory that the Trump administration blocked the company from selling to China. Nvidia ended up taking a smaller charge, totaling $4.5 billion.\nExcluding the charge, Nvidia would have earned an adjusted 96 cents a share in fiscal Q1.\nThe U.S. government notified Nvidia on April 9 that it will need to get export licenses to sell its H20 processor in China and other restricted markets. The move effectively barred Nvidia from selling the throttled processor, which it designed to meet previous U.S. export restrictions.\n6:16 p.m. E.T.\nNvidia CEO Says He Trusts Trump Will Make Right Decisions On AI\nChief Executive Jensen Huang said he is confident that President Trump will make the right decisions when it comes to supporting the U.S. AI industry.\n\"The president has a plan. He has a vision and I trust him,\" Huang said. President Trump wants to win the AI race, he said.\nHuang listed four positive surprises this year for the AI market. They include demand growth from inference reasoning, agentic AI, industrial AI and the cancelation of the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule.\nHuang said he will be on the road next week in Europe. He hinted that new AI data center announcements are pending from the continent.\n\"We're at the beginning of the buildout and there should be many more announcements in the future,\" he said.\nEarnings call has ended. Nvidia stock up more than 4%.\n5:45 p.m. E.T.\nNvidia CEO Warns Moves Against China Could Backfire\nOn the earnings call, Huang said U.S. government officials are underestimating China's tech industry. If U.S. tech companies are blocked from the Chinese market, China will build its own ecosystem, including its own AI processors, he said.\n\"U.S. technology leadership is at stake,\" he said. \"China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success.\"\n\"The question is not whether China will have AI. It already does,\" Huang also said. \"The question is whether one of the world's largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position. Export restrictions have spurred China's innovation and scale.\"\n5:21 p.m. E.T.\nA 'Challenging' Quarter\nOn a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress called fiscal Q1 a \"challenging operating environment.\"\nShe said losing access to the China market would have a \"material adverse impact\" on Nvidia and \"benefit competitors in China and worldwide.\"\nLarge cloud service providers were the biggest customer segment of Nvidia's data center business in fiscal Q1, at just under 50% of revenue, Kress said.\n\"The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications,\" she said.\nOn Wall Street, Nvidia's report drew cheers as the stock rallied nearly 5% in late trades\n5:06 p.m. E.T.\nNvidia Warning On China Market\nIn prepared remarks, Kress explained the smaller H20 charge in Q1.\n\"The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials,\" she said.\nThe company's second-quarter revenue guidance reflects a loss in H20 revenue of about $8 billion due to the recent export control limitations, Kress said.\nIn the company's 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nvidia said it is still hoping to supply China with a modified processor.\n\"We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG's export control rules,\" the company said. \"The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the 'performance density' of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip.\"\nNvidia said it may be unable to create a competitive product for China's data center market that receives approval from the U.S. government.\n\"In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition,\" Nvidia said.\n4:51 p.m. E.T.\nDemand Was 'Incredibly Strong'\nOn a year-over-year basis, Nvidia earnings rose 33% while sales jumped 69% in fiscal Q1.\nNvidia's data center revenue surged 73% from the year-ago period to $39.1 billion.\nNvidia recorded H20 product sales of $4.6 billion in the first quarter prior to the new export licensing requirements. The company was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 products in the period.\n\"Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong,\" Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a news release. \"AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate.\"\nHe added, \"Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer \u2014 a 'thinking machine' designed for reasoning \u2014 is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers.\"\n3:52 p.m. E.T.\nNvidia Gives Up Gains As Session Ends\nNvidia stock gave up gains as the regular trading session drew to a close. The shares traded flat, last down a fraction at 135.20 with just minutes left in the session. Nvidia is expected to report first-quarter results after the closing bell.\n2:06 p.m. E.T.\nCathie Wood Loads Up On Nvidia Stock\nFund manager Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of Ark Invest, on Tuesday acquired more than 34,000 shares of Nvidia ahead of the chipmaker's fiscal Q1 report.\nThe purchases were split between two of Ark's actively managed exchange-traded funds: Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\nThe combined purchases of Nvidia stock totaled $4.7 million.\nNvidia stock posted more gains in late afternoon trades, up nearly 1% at 136.49.\n1:20 p.m. E.T.\nNvidia Stock Is Near Buy Point\nNvidia stock gained a fraction in afternoon trades ahead of the tech giant's first-quarter report.\nThe stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 137.40, based on IBD analysis. That base is within a larger consolidation pattern with a buy point of 153.13, according to MarketSurge.\nThe Nvidia earnings report will be closely watched as a barometer for the AI infrastructure market.\nOn Tuesday, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Nvidia's contract chipmaker, broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 196.22, according MarketSurge charts. TSM stock had flirted with that buy point last week, but closed below it. In recent trades, TSM stock was down a fraction to 197.17.\nOther Nvidia-linked stocks include system builders Dell Technologies (DELL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\n12:40 p.m. E.T.\nWhat Will Nvidia Say About Non-China Customers?\nNvidia turned positive in midday trades, gaining a fraction to 135.98.\nDeepwater Asset Management analysts Gene Munster and Brian Baker said they expect downward revisions from Wall Street analysts after Nvidia's Q1 report.\nIn a blog post, the analysts said Street estimates for revenue growth in 2025 likely will drop to around 40% year over year from the current expectation of 56%. U.S. chip export restrictions on China are to blame, they said.\n\"The key on the call will be any commentary from the company that suggests, outside of the impact from the China curbs, the demand from non-China customers is exceeding expectations,\" they wrote. \"In other words, management doesn't have to guide the July quarter higher than expectations, but rather show that the dip is temporary and tied to export paperwork, not end-market weakness.\"\n11:12 a.m. E.T.\nNvidia Stock: 'Expect A Very Noise Guide'\nNvidia stock still in the red in late morning trades.\nThe AI giant's shares have been a market laggard over the past year, Mizuho Securities trading-desk analyst Jordan Klein said in a client note Wednesday. But some investors believe it could be a \"catch-up trade\" if Nvidia \"can give anything better than expected in terms of outlook, Blackwell ramp, new China revenues.\"\nHe added, \"Gun to head, I would rather be long vs. short the stock today into the print. That said, I am starting to worry a bit with stock up so much (the) past few weeks into the print, given I expect a very noisy and potentially disappointing July-quarter guide.\"\n10:30 a.m. E.T\n'A Little Bit Of A Scare Factor'\nNvidia stock edged lower an hour into the trading session. Shares were off a fraction at 135.24 ahead of the tech giant's Q1 report.\nThe spotlight will be on the impact of the recent market turmoil triggered by the Trump administration's trade policies and growing geopolitical tensions.\n\"There's a little bit of a scare factor here,\" Bloomberg journalist Kriti Gupta said on a Wednesday morning broadcast. \"We talk about this every quarter. They're the A-plus-plus student. There's lofty expectations. This time it's the geopolitics of tariffs and the AI story that kind of meshed together.\"\n9:35 a.m. E.T.\nConsensus Numbers Likely 'Stale'\nNvidia stock traded sideways at the opening bell, last up a fraction at 135.57.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said Tuesday that sell-side analysts haven't fully accounted for the impact of the H20 sales ban in their estimates. So, there's a risk of Nvidia missing views because of \"stale\" consensus numbers, he said in a client note.\nMoore estimates that Nvidia had to take out $1 billion in lost sales to China in the April quarter. It will take out the rest of the write-off in the July quarter, he said.\n\"Nvidia is clearly lobbying for licenses to ship H20, which can be granted under the current system, or to remove the restrictions altogether,\" Moore said.\nNvidia argues that cutting off access to China will embolden China to develop a competing domestic hardware ecosystem, which \"will ultimately be a bigger issue for the U.S.,\" Moore said. He rates Nvidia stock as overweight with a price target of 160.\nLate Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Nvidia's hardware partners are accelerating production of the chipmaker's latest Blackwell AI data center racks after resolving technical issues that had delayed shipments. Those partners \u2014 including Dell Technologies (DELL), Foxconn, Inventec and Wistron \u2014 are now scaling up production of Nvidia GB200 AI racks, the FT said.\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nExpectations For Apple's WWDC Couldn't Be Lower\nMicrosoft Stock Earns Bullish Notes On AI Agents\nGet Full Access To IBD Stock Lists And Ratings\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "Not long ago, it seemed like generative artificial intelligence was poised to transform the world.\nIn 2023, Goldman Sachs forecast the technology would add $7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2033. McKinsey said generative AI would be \u201cthe next frontier\u201d in corporate productivity. You didn\u2019t have to look far to find other claims that ChatGPT and related AI systems were already \u201crevolutionizing business.\u201d\nMaybe it\u2019s too soon to check, but there are scant reports of actual GDP growth or job losses due to generative AI technologies. Usage of AI chatbots isn\u2019t really all that high, and companies that have invested millions in making the technology work for them have realized that it\u2019s delivering remarkably little value in return.\nAre we in a temporary lull before generative AI delivers on its promise? Or will AI chatbots ultimately end up being useful but not revolutionary tools, more like spellcheckers?\nHow AI falls short of high expectations\nAdvertisement\nChatGPT gained 100 million users between its November 2022 launch and January 2023. However, that growth has slowed. ChatGPT says it had 200 million weekly users in August 2024. Meanwhile, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok count their users in the billions.\nThe signs aren\u2019t even looking particularly promising for the technology in business settings \u2014 inside the companies where generative AI is supposedly going to supercharge productivity and threaten human jobs.\nAfraid of missing out on AI-fueled opportunities, CEOs in a wide range of industries have been spending heavily on generative AI hardware, software, and services \u2014 totaling an estimated $150 billion this year, according to a Sequoia Capital estimate. But as I wrote in my recent book \u201cBrain Rush,\u201d companies are also terrified of being sued if the technology hallucinates. That is making them hesitant to deploy their AI investments.\nAdvertisement\nOf 200 to 300 generative AI experiments the typical large company is undertaking, usually only about 10 to 15 have led to widespread internal rollouts, and perhaps one or two have led to something released to customers, according to my June interview with Liran Hason, CEO of Aporia, a startup that sells companies a system that detects AI hallucinations.\nFear of AI going wrong was palpable when I participated in a meeting of retail executives in August. For example, in 2023, an Air Canada chatbot incorrectly explained the airline\u2019s bereavement policy to a customer and suggested he would be owed a refund for a flight he didn\u2019t take. Air Canada tried to get out of the deal that its AI cut with the customer, but this February, a Canadian tribunal forced the airline to pay a partial refund, Wired reported. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s AI Overviews at one point was advising people to add glue to their pizza recipe and eat a rock every day to improve their health.\nIn August, I asked ChatGPT to read through \u201cBrain Rush\u201d and return a story that potential readers would find compelling. Sadly, it replied with a fantastic story that it completely made up. When I told ChatGPT to try again to find a story from the book, it confidently presented me with another bogus tale.\nAI adoption is also being slowed by employees\u2019 reticence about the technology. Even if they do not outright fear AI will replace them someday, many workers justifiably fear that they will be expected to use AI to do more with the same or even fewer resources. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting additional resources to evaluate AI for its potential benefit,\u201d Bob Huber, chief security officer at cybersecurity provider Tenable, told CNBC. \u201cThe resources have to come from elsewhere, whether that\u2019s via reprioritization of people\u2019s time or placing other projects on the back burner.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is having trouble persuading customers to pay extra for Copilot, a generative AI-powered assistant for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, because of performance and cost issues, according to The Information. My own experience with Copilot was less than thrilling \u2014 I gave the AI assistant a D- for its weak ability to help me write an article.\nTo be fair, proponents of AI chatbots say we should just be patient because the technology will keep improving. GPT-5, expected to come out late this year or early next year, will \u201cprocess and generate images, audio, and potentially even video\u201d in addition to handling text, as PC Guide put it.\nI am skeptical because these new features would do nothing to alleviate hallucinations. Even if future generations of AI chatbots are trained on more data and somehow develop a richer representation of the world, they\u2019ll still have the same underlying problem: a lack of integrity. That\u2019s why they fake responses. Generative AI guesses a plausible next word in a sentence. Sometimes it will guess right, and sometimes it will guess wrong.\nThe need for a killer app\nFor generative AI to meet the high expectations for it, business leaders must discover and deploy a killer app \u2014 something that gives many people an overwhelming reason to use the new technology. The killer app for the personal computer was the electronic spreadsheet. The iPod\u2019s was the iTunes store.\nAdvertisement\nMost people using generative AI are doing it to help them overcome, say, writer\u2019s block as they compose an email. A small number of companies are using AI to boost the productivity of business processes such as sales, customer service, and coding. This phenomenon is especially striking in the video game industry, which has seen growth dry up since 2020. Many companies are losing money, finding it hard to raise capital, and laying off people. But because AI can produce images and write code, it\u2019s enabling companies to develop new games with far fewer team members. To lower the cost of building games that might not succeed in the market, one video game developer is reducing the size of the average development team by 80 percent, to about 20 to 25 people.\nBut such cost cutting will not ever add $7 trillion to global GDP. That kind of transformation will only happen if companies use generative AI to create new sources of growth.\nUntil those arise, you should be skeptical about claims that this technology is about to change the world.\nPeter Cohan is the founder of the Peter Cohan & Associates strategy consulting firm and an associate professor of management practice at Babson College.

  "argos_summary": "Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Q2 earnings are viewed as a potential market mover that could eclipse Fed Chair Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole remarks, reflecting the company\u2019s outsized influence on the S&P\u202f500 and investor anxiety over the low returns of AI investments. Analysts anticipate revenue near $45.6\u202fbillion and EPS of about $0.81, but export restrictions on its H\u201120 chip and weaker-than\u2011expected guidance raise the risk of a disappointing outlook that could ripple through AI\u2011related stocks. Meanwhile, Palantir\u2019s mixed performance and the broader generative\u2011AI sector\u2019s struggle to deliver a \u201ckiller app\u201d highlight a gap between hype and actual productivity gains. These dynamics suggest that the current AI boom may be premature, with many firms reporting little value from their substantial AI spend.",
