  "content": "ADAFSA-Approved Platform Sets New Standards for Immersive and Accessible Food Safety Training\n\nABU DHABI, UAE, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Mental has announced the launch of FoodStars, the first online Essential Food Safety Training (EFST) program approved by the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA). A homegrown innovation backed by Hub71, FoodStars offers a groundbreaking approach to corporate learning through immersive game-based design.\n\nMental is a member of Abu Dhabi Gaming's ecosystem, a government-led initiative dedicated to transforming Abu Dhabi into a global gaming hub and committed to driving innovation within the gaming industry and supporting companies that push the boundaries of what gaming technology can achieve.\n\nMental's entry into Abu Dhabi Gaming's ecosystem and the launch of FoodStars exemplify how gaming can extend beyond entertainment into sectors such as food and corporate training. This aligns with Abu Dhabi Gaming's mission to foster talent, support game development, and create meaningful opportunities for businesses in the UAE and beyond.\n\nSpeaking on the collaboration, Hani Abu Ghazaleh, CEO of Mental, stated: \"At Mental, we believe that learning should be engaging, effective, and accessible. Being part of Abu Dhabi Gaming's ecosystem helps us reshape how professional training is delivered across the UAE. FoodStars is just the beginning, we're excited to keep exploring how gamification can revolutionize corporate learning and empower workforces across industries.\"\n\nFoodStars transforms mandatory food safety training into an interactive, game-powered experience that is both effective and engaging. FoodStars marks a significant step in redefining food safety education, leveraging the power of gaming to replace the traditional EFST (Essential Food Safety Training) course with an engaging, accessible, and regulator-approved alternative. Built by game industry veterans from studios such as Ubisoft, Microsoft, and Activision, FoodStars has been developed in close consultation with ADAFSA and leading food safety experts to meet the highest compliance standards.\n\nHashem Al Kaabi, Head of Operations and Corporate Services at Hub71 said: \"Innovation in FoodTech has the potential to transform the future of food security, and collaboration is key to driving meaningful impact. Through our UAE Champions Program, we connected ADAFSA with Mental, a Hub71 startup, to explore new solutions in this space. The launch of FoodStars reflects our commitment to fostering groundbreaking technologies and strengthening Abu Dhabi's position as a hub for innovation.\"",
