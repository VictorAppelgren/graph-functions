  "title": "I\u2019ve listened to Taylor Swift\u2019s mysterious new Spotify playlist \u2013 here\u2019s how to find it and why it\u2019s a new era for music streaming",
  "description": "The Life of a Showgirl is coming our way",
  "content": "\u2022 Taylor Swift has announced her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, and she's using Spotify to kick-start the roll out\n\u2022 A mysterious Spotify playlist curated by Swift now appears in her artist page, packing 22 of her best songs to tease the next era\n\u2022 This marks the beginning of the album rollout, taking to a music streaming service first before TikTok to promote new music\n\nIt\u2019s official, a new Taylor Swift record is on the way \u2013 and the internet is going feral. The singer announced her upcoming album, The Life of a Showgirl, on August 12, and she\u2019s using Spotify in order to prepare us for the next era.\n\nAlongside the announcement of her 12th studio album - also referred to as TS12 - a collection of strange billboards across New York City and Nashville showcasing a giant mint-green Spotify code with cascading orange glitter (see below), which fans immediately spotted.\n\nWhen you scan the code in the Spotify app, it takes you to a playlist curated by Swift herself titled \u2018And, baby, that\u2019s show business for you\u2019 \u2013 and it appears to drop subtle hints for the upcoming release.\n\nFor starters, the new Spotify playlist packs 22 of Swift\u2019s biggest pop bangers from albums Red, 1989, and Reputation. Coincidentally, they\u2019re all songs produced by Max Martin with whom she hasn\u2019t worked with since 2017, which leads us to believe her long-time collaborator Jack Antonoff won\u2019t be returning for TS12.\n\nAt the moment, this project is still a little ambiguous, and this mysterious Spotify playlist is all we have as of yet. However, it\u2019s an interesting strategy to say the least, and one that I think could do wonders for encouraging artists to use music streaming services more for music promotion over platforms such as TikTok.\n\nHow to find Taylor Swift\u2019s new Spotify playlist\n\nAfter scouring the Spotify app for ways to track down the playlist, I've discovered two ways to find it.\n\nThe first is by scanning the Spotify code that was teased in the billboards. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to be there in person, and you can scan any image of the code online using the camera feature in the Spotify app.\n\nAlternatively, head to the Spotify app and go to Taylor Swift\u2019s artist page. Scroll down until you see the \u2018Artist Playlists\u2019 section, and the newly curated playlist will be there. This is the easiest way to locate it, so I would recommend trying this as opposed to scanning the Spotify code.\n\nFor the past few years, it\u2019s been the new norm for artists to use platforms such as TikTok to promote new music, and while Spotify has introduced countdowns to hype new album releases, that\u2019s pretty much it when it comes to offering artists ways to market their music.\n\nAt the time of Swift\u2019s 2022 album Midnights, TikTok was crucial to the album rollout, and each week Swift would post a video to reveal one song from the tracklist. Her 2024 album The Tortured Poets Department adopted a similar Tiktok-style rollout, but her upcoming project The Life of a Showgirl has been absent from the platform \u2013 for now.\n\nWhile the Swift-curated Spotify playlist is far from revolutionary, it\u2019s certainly a step away from promotional practices we\u2019ve seen become the norm in recent years, as most artists immediately jump on the TikTok bandwagon. Of course, Swift will inevitably take to other platforms as we get closer to the album release date, but it\u2019s still an exciting way to kickstart the new era.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early days into the album rollout \u2013 we don\u2019t even have an official release date yet \u2013 but after Swift was crowned Spotify\u2019s top artist of 2024, this strategy makes a lot of sense. Will other artists catch on and revert to using music streaming services to promote new music instead of throwing it all on TikTok? Let us know what you think about it in the comments below.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 I've been a Spotify subscriber for 10 years, but it needs to do these 5 vital things if it wants me to stick around\n\u2022 I\u2019m a huge Spotify fan but Apple Music does these 7 things much better \u2013 and they\u2019re tempting me to switch\n\u2022 Spotify's audiobooks add-on has finally rolled out in the US - here are 3 other new features you may have missed",

      "text": "Apple Music is celebrating 10 years with a personalized \u2018All Time\u2019 Playlist, and there\u2019s a way for Spotify listeners to get in on the action\nA look back on all your Apple Music streams\n- Apple Music has turned 10 and is letting users take a look back\n- The Replay All Time playlist lets you see your top 100 tracks since you joined Apple Music\n- It's a nice throwback treat, and there's a way for Spotify users to get a taste\nTime flies when you\u2019re listening to some good music, right? Well, Apple Music has officially turned ten today, and since Apple got into the streaming music game, a lot has changed. We\u2019ve seen design changes and new features \u2013 remember its annual replay functionality arrived in 2019 \u2013 but marking ten years of streaming is a new playlist that lets you look back.\nRolling out for Apple Music subscribers now is a \u2018Replay All Time\u2019 playlist, which gives you your top 100 most played tracks since you joined the service. That could be a very long way back if you\u2019ve been streaming since 2015, or a more recent look, but either route, it\u2019ll likely be a journey through taste.\nI found the \u2018Replay All Time\u2019 playlist right on my home tab in the Music app on my iPhone and my Mac. The description for the playlists reads, \u201cIn honor of Apple Music\u2019s first decade, take a look back. Relive your all-time favorite tracks, all in one playlist.\u201d And as with any playlist on Apple Music, you can play it in sequence or shuffle it, as well as save it to your library and download for offline listening.\nMy All Time playlist did have a few surprises, and I expected that as I joined the service back on day one, June 30, 2015. There were plenty of previous songs of the summer \u2013 anyone remember Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u2018Can\u2019t Stop This Feeling\u2019 or \u2018I Lived\u2019 by OneRepublic? \u2013 but also many of my favorite tracks that I opt for quite a bit.\nSo, yes, for me, that means a lot of Bruce Springsteen, and I noticed some appearances that were used as a wake-up alarm on my HomePod and HomePod mini. It\u2019s a neat walk down memory lane, though, and at an unexpected time of the year. Usually, Apple Music rolls out Replay towards the end of the year, offering a look back at your year in music.\nSpotify also rolls out Wrapped yearly and adds in a lot more social elements, as well as categorization based on your music taste. And if you\u2019re a Spotify user who wants a similar look back at the decade or since Spotify launched in your region \u2013 it was July of 2011 for the United States \u2013 you\u2019ll need to look to a third-party to get the experience \u2026 though the service might end up copying a bit of Apple\u2019s celebration here.\nStats.fm is always a good choice for learning a bit more about your listening habits and what you\u2019re streaming the most on various cadences, and this would be an excellent route. If you sign in with your Spotify account and grant permissions, you can select for a \u201clifetime\u201d look at your top genres, tracks, and artists \u2013 all of this without needing to subscribe to the \u201cPlus\u201d tier.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt will provide your top 50 tracks, and you can easily select one of those to play. You can opt to subscribe to Stats.fm to unlock more statistics and more than just your 50 top tracks from Spotify.\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if Spotify rolls this out in a formal way, but it\u2019s great that you can use a third-party to accomplish this. Still, Apple Music\u2019s rollout of an All Time playlist is a nice touch, and it comes ahead of the music service debuting the top 500 most-streamed songs. That process will begin on July 1, 2025, and will announce a set of 100 tracks daily, days before dropping a full playlist for listeners to enjoy.\nApple\u2019s also rolling out other playlists to celebrate the anniversary and some new Apple Music Radio specials. And there\u2019s a new, over 15,000-square-foot Apple Music studio location opening in Los Angeles, California, which includes listening rooms kitted for immersive Spatial Audio playback. It\u2019ll have larger stages and studios for artists to record and perform on.\nYou might also like\n- This is my favorite 'hidden' iPhone feature and if you also own a Mac, you should be using it right now\n- Disneyland turns 70, and it's celebrating with MagicBand+, LED spectacles, and next-gen shows\n- 70 hours later, and I'm convinced The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is a true system seller\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "Spotify's audiobooks add-on has finally rolled out in the US - here are 3 other new features you may have missed\nFinally, you can remove that awful Create button\nOver the past few weeks, several new additions have been made to Spotify's ecosystem, now available for US users following the rollout of the new Audiobooks+ subscription add-on. But while you've been getting used to its audiobook upgrade, Spotify has rolled out other features that you may have missed \u2013 and they're ones you'll want to check out.\nWhen it comes to new features in Spotify, the music streaming service can be very discreet. Luckily for you, I'm a Spotify power-user, and I can sense a new feature from a mile away. These are the three latest additions for you to try below.\n1. Music Following feed\nSimilarly to the Podcast Following filter introduced back in May, Spotify has quietly added one for Music.\nWhen you tap the \u2018Music\u2019 filter at the top of the Spotify homepage, the new \u2018Following\u2019 filter will appear next to it, which shows you the latest releases from the artists you follow \u2013 creating a designated space for you to preview, play, and save new music.\n2. Hide the irritating Create button\nSpotify\u2019s decision to add the Create button to the navigation bar was met with a slew of complaints from annoyed users, many of whom addressed its interference with muscle memory. Thankfully, Spotify has answered our requests, and you now have the option to remove the Create button from your Spotify app.\nWeeks before Spotify introduced this new feature, users online had speculated that the music streaming platform was in the process of removing the Create button, but there was no official mention from Spotify.\nIf you\u2019re like me and long for your Spotify account to go back to the way it was, you can now remove the Create button easily. Head to the Spotify app and open \u2018Settings and privacy\u2019, then tap on the section labelled \u2018Content and display\u2019. Under the \u2018Display preferences\u2019 heading, you\u2019ll see a toggle that will remove the Create button. Disable it, and you\u2019ll feel a sense of relief as you see your Spotify go back to normal.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n3. Discover Weekly gets a makeover\nTo celebrate 10 years since the birth of its landmark Discover Weekly playlist, which updates every Monday to expose you to new music releases and artists, Spotify has given one of its most popular features a much-needed revamp.\nIn addition to its fresh design upgrade with bold, striking graphics that change with each weekly update, your Discover Weekly playlist now comes with genre filters, which allow you to search through up to five different genres based on your listening history. When you select a genre filter, this will create a 30-song playlist, setting you out on a new music discovery adventure.\nYou might also like\nRowan is an Editorial Associate and Apprentice Writer for TechRadar.

      "text": "Spotify\u2019s new Upcoming Releases hub may be my new favorite feature since Daylists, and now I can see all my pre-saved albums\nOnly 35 days until the Lorde returns\n- Spotify has launched a new feature in its search hub called Upcoming Releases\n- Users can now view and pre-save upcoming albums from two lists based on their listening history and the most pre-saved albums globally\n- Upcoming Releases also provides listeners with a space to access Countdown Pages, merch, and more\nSpotify is really doing its bit to prove that it\u2019s still the best music streaming service, and its freshly-launched Upcoming Releases hub does just that. The platform has just rolled out the new feature, creating an in-app space dedicated to keeping tabs on new album releases.\nYesterday Spotify announced the feature in a blog post and, as the name suggests, it will allow you to view and pre-save recommended soon-to-be-released albums based on your personal listening habits all from one place. Additionally, you\u2019ll also be able to view the top 10 anticipated new releases based on the number of global pre-saves.\nOne of the better parts of the Upcoming Releases hub is that it\u2019s very easy to find in the Spotify app. Head to the main search hub and scroll down to \u2018Browse all\u2019, and there you\u2019ll find the brand new Upcoming Releases section next to your \u2018Made For You\u2019 hub. From there, you can pre-save upcoming albums hassle-free, and can quickly access album Countdown Pages to view the tracklist, listen to singles, check out merch, and watch clips.\nUpcoming Releases marks a first for Spotify and significantly enhances the music streamer\u2019s approach to giving fans more ways of staying in the loop with new music. Last year Spotify introduced Countdown Pages for artists which not only breathed new life into album release strategies, but gave fans a new way of engaging with the pre-release hype.\nNow that Spotify has launched the Upcoming Releases hub powered by Countdown Pages, it could give the platform a leg-up for bringing you closer to new music - and I\u2019m already warming up to it.\nI like what I see, I like it a lot\nLike any music obsessive, having my ear to the ground with new music releases is in my nature, however it can be quite the task when it comes to keeping tabs on new albums especially if you listen to a lot of different genres and artists like myself.\nBut Spotify\u2019s Upcoming Releases hub could be the answer to all my new music questions, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve taken to a new feature this quickly since Daylists landed in 2023.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSo far Upcoming Releases is limited to two different categories, \u2018For you\u2019 and \u2018Top 10 countdowns\u2019, which is the only downside to the new feature but I\u2019m hoping this is intentional.\nIt would make sense for Spotify to start small and then build on the feature as users get used to it, so with that said I\u2019d like to see Spotify add genre-specific recommendations for example \u2018Most popular indie upcoming releases\u2019, or even a section that groups soon-to-be-released albums from artists touring your local area.\nI think there's a lot of room for this new feature to evolve, but it\u2019s still early days and at the moment, I\u2019m just excited to test the waters with it and see how often the recommendations are updated. Besides, it will save me bags of time scrolling through Metacritic\u2019s list of new releases to find out who's bringing out new material.\nYou might also like\n- Spotify has secretly added a new way to disable one of its most disliked features, and I\u2019m fully on board\n- Spotify HiFi: release date rumors, price predictions, and everything we know so far\n- Spotify\u2019s new \u2018snooze\u2019 button will let you blacklist unwanted songs for a month \u2013 and I wish it had existed earlier\nRowan is an Editorial Associate and Apprentice Writer for TechRadar.

      "text": "This new iOS 26 feature for Apple Music is going viral \u2013 and as a Spotify fan, I'm feeling very jealous\nOh, this is going to be good\n- Apple Music announced AutoMix at WWDC 2025, and the new iOS 26 feature is already going viral\n- Though it's still in developer beta, those with early access are taking to TikTok to unveil AutoMix's AI capabilities\n- It will roll out with other iOS 26 features in September, and I'm hoping that Spotify will take note\nWhen Apple hosted its recent WWDC 2025 event, we had our ears to the ground when it came to all things iOS 26, and as a music-streaming obsessive there\u2019s one new feature that immediately caught my attention \u2013 Apple Music\u2019s AutoMix.\nWhile Apple announced a total of three new upgrades for one of the best music streaming services, including a handy lyrics-pronunciation feature, it\u2019s the highly anticipated AutoMix function that has won over music fans. As someone who stands by their Spotify account I have to say that I like what Apple is doing, and though we'll have to wait until September for a full rollout, the feature has already gone viral.\nIf you\u2019re not up to date on all things WWDC, AutoMix is essentially an AI tool in Apple Music that creates unique, on-the-spot mixes between songs \u2013 similarly to how a DJ would transition between songs in a live set. It works very differently to your standard crossfade feature found in both Apple Music and Spotify, which simply crosses from one song to another to avoid gaps of silence.\nIt\u2019ll be a while yet before all Apple Music users have access to AutoMix \u2013 it\u2019s currently in developer beta testing, and will enter public beta in July. But thanks to those with early access, my TikTok feed is packed with sneak peaks and first impressions of AutoMix \u2013 and right now it\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about.\nIs AutoMix the first viral Apple Music trend?\nFrom the videos I\u2019m seeing at the moment, AutoMix creates a seamless playback experience using beat matching and time stretching to connect each song in a queue. And apart from the downside of having to sacrifice the first or last 15-20 seconds of a song for smooth mixing, AutoMix is already looking to be a exciting addition to Apple Music's ecosystem.\nI\u2019m beginning to warm to certain AI features on music streaming platforms \u2013 most recently Spotify\u2019s AI DJ \u2013 after being put off for years, and so far AutoMix doesn\u2019t come across as overly intrusive, a trap that some AI music tools can fall into. Not only is it eliminating those awkward silences between songs like the crossfade function, but it\u2019s injecting a lot of fun and hype into listening sessions.\nTake a look at this TikTok video of Lady Gaga\u2019s Schei\u00dfe mixing with her recent hit Abracadabra, which has garnered over a million views.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nUsers have been experimenting with lots of different tunes, and even blending different genres. This video of Pink Floyd\u2019s Time segueing into Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller shows that AutoMix can work with very different sounds, and beat-match songs with varying BPM.\nThis is also the first time I\u2019m seeing an Apple Music feature make the rounds on the internet in the same way Spotify\u2019s Daylist, and even AI DJ, went viral when they were first released. AutoMix has already amped Apple Music\u2019s social aspect, providing users with a space where they can engage with other Apple Music users online, and share their reactions and experiences.\nI think this is a big step in elevating Apple Music\u2019s sense of community, even if it\u2019s still a way behind Spotify when it comes to social elements. That aside, AutoMix is just a very fun and uplifting new feature that I can\u2019t wait to see arrive with the full iOS 26 rollout \u2013 I hope Spotify is watching, and taking notes.\nYou might also like\nRowan is an Editorial Associate and Apprentice Writer for TechRadar.
