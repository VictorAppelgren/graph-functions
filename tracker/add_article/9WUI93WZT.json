      "summary": "Trump’s July tax bill temporarily exempts federal income taxes on tips for workers earning under $160,000, extending beyond traditional tipped jobs to include podcasters, influencers, and other service roles. The Treasury’s list covers eight categories such as entertainment, hospitality, and personal services, affecting roughly 4 million workers—about 2.5% of U.S. jobs. While the immediate fiscal impact is modest, the provision could spur behavioral shifts toward tipped employment, potentially raising the deficit by $32–$40 billion through 2028.",
