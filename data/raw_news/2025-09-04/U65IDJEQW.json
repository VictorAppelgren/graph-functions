  "title": "The Galaxy S25 FE is finally here, and there's good and bad news",
  "description": "Samsung has finally launched the Galaxy S25 FE, and the good news is that there are a couple of long-overdue upgrades.",
  "content": "Those hoping for a giant leap forward in most areas might be disappointed, but the new phone still brings a few key hardware upgrades that make it stand out from the Galaxy S24 FE. Furthermore, the device also brings some software features previously seen on the Galaxy S25 series and Z7 foldables.\n\nUnbox the new FE phone, and you\u2019ll see a design that\u2019s still similar to the Galaxy S24 FE. However, Samsung claims it\u2019s using an \u201cenhanced\u201d Armor Aluminum frame in line with the Galaxy S25 series. It also says the phone is 7.4mm thin and weighs 190 grams, making it thinner and lighter than the previous device (8mm, 213 grams).\n\nThe Galaxy S25 FE is a little slimmer and lighter than last year's phone, but that's about it from a design perspective.\n\nPop the hood and you\u2019ll find an Exynos 2400 chipset. This is virtually identical to the Exynos 2400e used in the S24 FE. However, Samsung is apparently using a 13% larger vapor chamber cooling system. This should theoretically enable smoother performance during extended gaming sessions. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve still got 8GB of RAM here. We\u2019ve seen smartphone brands, including Samsung, offer more RAM in recent years due to on-device AI workloads. So I have to wonder whether the phone might miss out on some advanced AI features down the line.\n\nEven the screen seems identical to last year\u2019s phone, namely a 6.7-inch FHD+ OLED panel with 1,900 nits of peak brightness. The panel offers a 120Hz refresh rate, but can only drop down to 60Hz. By contrast, the base S25 drops down to as low as 1Hz to save juice. We\u2019ve still got an under-display fingerprint sensor here, but it\u2019s unclear whether this is still an optical scanner or a more modern ultrasonic design. We\u2019ve asked Samsung to clarify this.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 FE retains 15W wireless charging speeds, but Samsung says the phone is \u201cQi2 Ready\u201d and can use magnetically attached accessories with the aid of a case. You\u2019ll just have to pick up the Pixel 10 series (or HMD Skyline) if you want an Android phone with integrated magnets.\n\nGalaxy S25 FE software: No waiting for One UI 8\n\nThe Galaxy S25 FE ships with Android 16 and One UI 8 out of the box, much like the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 series. There are plenty of software enhancements here, with arguably the most notable additions being Now Bar and Now Brief support.\n\nKeen on this new FE handset? Then the Galaxy S25 FE starts at $649.99 / \u00a3649 for the 8GB/128GB model. Yep, Samsung is sticking with 128GB of base storage once again. Otherwise, Samsung is also offering an 8GB/256GB model for $709.99 / \u00a3699. The company is also offering an 8GB/512GB variant in the UK for \u00a3799, but it\u2019s not listed for the US.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nHere are the phone update policies from every major Android manufacturer\nApril 15, 2025\nIf you have an Android smartphone, you likely want it to last as long as possible, especially if you\u2019ve spent upwards of $1,000 on a flagship model. You probably have a case to protect it physically, but what about the software inside the phone? How can you keep that safe? This is where phone updates come into play \u2014 an integral aspect of keeping your phone working its best long after you buy it.\nUnfortunately, the company that created your phone plays a major part in how frequently you see updates, not to mention for how long. In this guide, we\u2019re going to give you all the info you need on phone updates as well as what you can expect from the major manufacturers.\nPhone updates: What are they, and where do they come from?\nIn the Android world, there are two types of smartphone updates. There are major upgrades to a new version of Android that usually land once a year. The more frequent type is a security patch, which lands on a monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly basis. For the sake of clarity, we\u2019re going to refer to the former as upgrades and the latter as patches.\n- Upgrades \u2014 This is when your phone jumps from one Android version to another. For example, if your device has Android 13 and gets an update that takes it to Android 14, that\u2019s an upgrade. These usually come once a year and represent a major shift in the functionality and sometimes even the overall look of your phone\u2019s software.\n- Patches \u2014 These are smaller and more frequent. The main reason these land is to enhance the security of your phone. Sometimes they also include new features, although this will heavily depend on your phone\u2019s manufacturer.\nWhich smartphone manufacturer do you trust the most for software updates?\nGoogle \u2014 which owns and maintains the Android operating system \u2014 is responsible for creating and issuing both upgrades and patches. This is why Google\u2019s Pixel phones usually see upgrades and patches first. For phones not manufactured by Google, upgrades and patches need to go through the manufacturer first so it can modify code to accommodate specific products. In most cases, this slows down distribution. Likewise, carriers and chipset vendors may also delay rollouts for a variety of reasons.\nUltimately, how frequently your phone receives updates depends on how seriously your phone\u2019s manufacturer takes them. Simply put, some Android manufacturers place more importance on updates than others. Below, you\u2019ll see how much of a difference there can be!\nApple\n- Apple\u2019s stated commitment is five years of software support, but that\u2019s only the minimum. In reality, the company usually offers at least six years of support for all its phones, even those in the budget SE line.\nObviously, Apple is not an Android manufacturer, but it\u2019s helpful to have it on this list for the sake of comparison. Only recently did we find out what Apple\u2019s stated commitment is for iPhone software updates: five years. That would be five years of iOS upgrades and security patches.\nHowever, Apple exceeds this commitment nearly all the time. Most iPhones \u2014 from the most expensive Pro Max model to the cheapest SE model \u2014 get at least six years of support. The five-year commitment is just as low as Apple would ever go, but we doubt it would ever shelve an iPhone at the five-year mark.\nYou\u2019ll find, as you continue this article, that this commitment puts the majority of Android OEMs to shame.\nASUS\n- ASUS typically offers two upgrades and at least two years of security patches for its lineup.\nTypically, ASUS doesn\u2019t release a significant number of phones each year. One would assume this would mean the company would have a stellar phone update policy since it only needs to focus on a handful of devices. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not really the case.\nThe company promised at least two major upgrades for ASUS\u2019 most recent flagships in the Zenfone and ROG Phone ranges. ASUS also said its most recent phones would receive security updates for four years, with the ZenFone 12 Ultra extending this by a year. This is much better than its previous commitment, which was just two years of security patches. Unfortunately, some ASUS phones still stick to that policy.\nTwo Android upgrades and two years of patches represent Google\u2019s recommended minimum for after-purchase support. In other words, ASUS is only making the minimum promise for most of its devices.\nASUS\u2019 delivery of timely updates has also been mixed over the years. With the Zenfone 8, for example, ASUS pushed the Android 12 update in early January 2022, roughly three months after the stable launch. Previously, it pushed Android 11 to the Zenfone 7 series in April 2021 \u2014 roughly eight months after the stable launch of the operating system. This shows ASUS is getting faster, which is good, but its commitment could be stronger.\n- Google set a new benchmark with the Pixel 8 series, committing to seven upgrades and seven years of security patches. Most of its lineup promises three upgrades and five years of security patches. Everything before the Pixel 6 series, however, only receives three years of patches.\nFrom 2016 to mid-2021, Google had a phone update policy for Pixels that was not too bad: three years of upgrades and patches. This was better than most other companies, and Google\u2019s consistency was very impressive. Pixel phones are almost always the first to see the newest upgrade, and patches land at the beginning of each month like clockwork.\nGoogle is one of the best companies when it comes to keeping its phones up-to-date and safe.\nIn 2021, with the launch of the Google Pixel 6 series, the company augmented its policy. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series will see three upgrades and five years of patches. Unfortunately, Pixels launched before the Pixel 6 series will stick with the former policy. But Google didn\u2019t stop there. With the launch of the Pixel 8 series, though, Google set a new high watermark for Android phone support. The smartphone duo will see seven upgrades, with seven years of security updates. The company has since extended this policy to the mid-range Pixel 8a, making it the best-supported phone under $500. The newer Pixel 9a shares this promise.\nGoogle also has a great website that details exactly when its devices will stop receiving upgrades and patches. Without a doubt, Google helps set the bar for phone updates in the world of Android.\nHMD Global / Nokia\n- HMD Global typically offers two upgrades and two or three years of security patches for Nokia-branded phones.\nHMD Global manufactures smartphones with Nokia branding. Nokia phones come with a version of Android that is very close to stock. Originally, this helped HMD keep its phones up-to-date quickly and consistently because it didn\u2019t need to change much when Google pushed out the core update.\nHowever, HMD has fallen off the wagon over the past few years. A combination of an increasingly complex portfolio, as well as small profit margins for its budget-priced devices, likely contributed to this. At this point, HMD doesn\u2019t have a stated comprehensive phone update policy.\nThankfully, the company recently posted a page on its website to help people determine how long their phones will receive patches. A 2023 phone like the G22, for example, will receive three years of security updates through April 2026. Based on the website, many devices will receive security updates for a minimum of two years, with some devices seeing security updates for up to three years.\nThat\u2019s pretty par for the course, but HMD\u2019s track record with respect to upgrades isn\u2019t as good. Most of its older phones saw Android 11 after considerable delays, for example.\nHONOR\n- In most cases, HONOR commits to two upgrades and two years of security patches. However, recent HONOR Magic Pro models get special treatment with three upgrade commitments and five years of patches. The company extends this to seven years with the Magic 7 Pro.\nHONOR used to be a subsidiary of HUAWEI. Shortly after the HUAWEI ban took effect, HUAWEI sold HONOR to an independent firm, making HONOR its own brand without any ties to its former parent. Since then, it has only launched a handful of phones.\nSince that all happened, HONOR has committed to the standard phone update policy for most of its phones: two years of upgrades and patches. Even its 2022 flagship \u2014 the HONOR Magic 4 Pro \u2014 stuck with this promise, despite its high price. Thankfully, the two most recent HONOR flagships \u2014 the Magic 5 Pro and Magic 6 Pro \u2014 upped the ante to three upgrades and five years of patches.\nNotably, the company has promised seven years of Android upgrades and security patches starting with the Magic 7 Pro. Hopefully, all future phones from HONOR will see the same update commitment. Time will tell.\nHUAWEI\n- HUAWEI has no firm commitment to the rollout of upgrades and patches to its recent phones. Instead, it takes things on a case-by-case basis.\nDue to the HUAWEI ban, HUAWEI uses two different operating systems on its phones. Harmony OS (which is an Android fork) appears on phones in its native China. Meanwhile, regular Android (with its EMUI skin) appears on global devices. We\u2019ll be focused on the Android versions of HUAWEI\u2019s catalog here.\nRegardless of the operating system onboard, HUAWEI is unable to use Google services on its devices and doesn\u2019t seem to have access to the most recent versions of Android either.\nHUAWEI's smartphone business is in a shambles, making updates unreliable.\nCase in point, 2022\u2019s HUAWEI Mate 50 Pro flagship still has no schedule for getting Android 13, although HUAWEI does commit to two Android upgrades coming at some point. The Pura 70 Ultra from 2024 launched with Android 12, though, so it might just be that anything beyond that version isn\u2019t coming.\nMaking matters worse, HUAWEI can\u2019t even commit to a concrete promise of how long it will update its phones. In the case of the P50 Pro from 2022, it told us this: \u201cUpdates will be provided and maintained regularly throughout the full lifecycle of the product.\u201d That could mean anything, really.\nLikewise, the company also told us this at one point in an email:\nPrivacy protection and security have always been HUAWEI\u2019s top priority, and HUAWEI has been innovating to protect users\u2019 privacy and security. We rigorously adhere to foundational principles for data privacy during the entire product design and development process. We continuously provide security updates to our users, when necessary, and will continue to offer them timely technical support.\nOnce again, that could mean anything.\nThe bottom line here is that if phone updates are important to you, you should beware of HUAWEI devices.\nMotorola\n- Motorola flagships generally receive two software upgrades and two (or sometimes three) years of patches. The company\u2019s budget phones usually see just one upgrade and two years of patches. Currently, only one phone offers five years of coverage.\nMotorola has a problematic past when it comes to phone updates. When it launched the premium Motorola Edge series in 2020, for example, it promised just one Android upgrade and two years of patches. After public outcry (including from Android Authority), it amended its promise to two upgrades and two years of patches.\nIncredibly, the same thing happened again the following year with the Edge 20 series. The end result was the same: two years of upgrades and patches.\nIn 2022, it finally learned its lesson. It publicly promised to deliver two upgrades and three years of bi-monthly patches to the Motorola Edge 30 series. In 2023, it upped the ante again, offering three upgrades and four years of patches for the Motorola Edge Plus (2023).\nIn 2024, it finally offered five upgrades and five years of patches with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, a mid-range phone available in Europe and India. As of 2025, the ThinkPhone 25 and Moto G75 have since been placed on that list, too.\nHowever, Motorola stops short of offering good commitments like that to all its phones. Motorola\u2019s budget phones often see the original promise of one upgrade and two years of patches. Thankfully, Motorola makes it easy for users to know what they should expect with updates using a web-based tool. If you\u2019re a Motorola phone owner (or thinking of becoming one), a quick visit to that web page would be a good idea.\nNothing\n- Most Nothing-branded phone has an update commitment of three upgrades and four years of patches. However, the Phone 3a series will receive six years of security patches with three upgrades.\nNothing is the youngest smartphone brand on this list, but its update commitment already matches many players. So far, the three Nothing phones we\u2019ve seen \u2014 Phone 1, Phone 2, and Phone 2a \u2014 have the same update commitment, which is three Android upgrades and four years of patches.\nCurrently, the Nothing Phone 3a series is the only device line in the company\u2019s umbrella that\u2019ll receive six years of patches and three Android upgrades.\nNothing\u2019s speed with these updates has been pretty good. All Nothing phones are already on Android 14 and there some have already received Android 15, suggesting a timely rollout of Google\u2019s latest OS version.\nAs time goes on, Nothing could extend these commitments, considering Google and Samsung have extended theirs. However, Nothing\u2019s relative size could prevent it from offering too much of a commitment, so time will tell there.\nOnePlus\n- The OnePlus 13 gets four upgrades and six years of patches. Older flagships receive up to four upgrades and up to five years of patches. Mid-rangers in the Nord series get two upgrades and three years of patches. Budget Nord N models get one upgrade and two years of patches.\nOnePlus breaks down its support criteria based on the class of device at hand. The differences are notable. In brief, the more money you spend, the more support you\u2019ll receive.\nFor example, the OnePlus 13 line will receive four upgrades and six years of security patches while the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Open will all see four upgrades and five years of patches. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 10 Pro, OnePlus 9 series, etc., will receive three years of upgrades and a fourth year of security updates.\nHowever, when you step down to the mid-range Nord series, you\u2019ll see two years of Android updates and a third year of security updates. Finally, when you step down again to the budget-tier Nord N series \u2014 including devices like the Nord N30 and Nord N300 \u2014 you\u2019ll only get one upgrade and two years of security patches.\nUnfortunately, OnePlus\u2019 reliability in disseminating those updates has been up and down over the years. The company has become well-known for launching half-baked Android upgrades with sometimes devastating bugs. It also isn\u2019t incredibly consistent with the rollouts of its patches. Still, as long as you stick to flagship-tier products from the brand, you should be happy.\nOPPO\n- The Find X8 will receive five years of upgrades and six years of security patches. Most other OPPO flagships from 2023 and forward will receive four upgrades and five years of patches. Pre-2023 flagships will receive three upgrades and four years of patches. Mid-rangers get two upgrades and four years of patches. Budget models get one upgrade and three years of patches. Select ultra-budget models will see no upgrades.\nOPPO and OnePlus are essentially the same company, with both organizations using the same staff, the same R&D, and even the same code base for their respective Android skins. As such, it should be unsurprising to hear that OPPO\u2019s promises for phone updates are similar to those of OnePlus: the more you spend, the more you get.\nAt the top end, OPPO\u2019s flagships in its Find series launched in 2025 and beyond will receive five years of upgrades and six years of security patches, with older models receiving four upgrades and five years of patches. Meanwhile, older flagships \u2014 including the Find X5 series \u2014 will see three upgrades and four years of security patches.\nUnlike its slabby siblings, the foldable OPPO Find N5 will receive four years of upgrades and six years of security patches.\nThe mid-range OPPO F, K, Reno, and Find Lite/Neo series will see two upgrades and four years of patches. Finally, some of the budget OPPO A series phones will see one Android upgrade and three years of patches. Note that we say \u201csome\u201d there, meaning there could be OPPO A phones with zero upgrades.\nWhile OPPO\u2019s commitments to its budget phones are quite sad, it is nice to see the company lay it all out in public. At least with OPPO, you know what you\u2019re going to get.\nPOCO\n- POCO generally offers no firm commitment to upgrades and patches, instead issuing information on a phone-by-phone basis. Most of its phones see two years of overall support, including two upgrades. However, more recent models are offering a little more. The F7 Ultra, for instance, promises four years of upgrades and six years of security patches.\nPOCO has improved its update policy in recent years, but only for a handful of its devices. The F7 Ultra, for instance, will receive four years of upgrades and six years of security patches, meeting many other companies in this particular boat.\nHowever, good luck finding details for any of its older devices. When asked, offered only a brief statement about its plans to support its smartphones over time. \u201cCurrently, the Android updates and security patches cycles of our devices are in accordance with our agreements with Google and comply with corresponding policies.\u201d\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, POCO is passing the buck. Google has no set rule on how long manufacturers must issue phone updates, nor how regularly they should come. Google\u2019s suggested schedule is a minimum of two years, but the company hasn\u2019t done anything to enforce this.\nPOCO has historically given wishy-washy answers to our requests for formal commitments to software support.\nIn other words, POCO does not make any overall promises for its phones. To its credit, it has historically delivered two upgrades to most of its devices. It might take longer than we would like, but it does happen.\nDuring our review of the POCO F5 Pro, the company committed to two years of upgrades and three years of patches. The Poco X6 series, launched in January 2024, offers three upgrades and four years of patches. So the company is getting better slowly but surely.\nThe bottom line here is that you should approach any POCO purchases under the assumption that your device will get the bare minimum of software support.\nrealme\n- realme phones usually come with two upgrades and three years of patches, although newer phones are seeing better promises.\nIn 2022 and earlier, realme stuck to its original promise when it comes to phone updates. Despite its sister brands OPPO and OnePlus upping the ante for flagship phones, realme stuck with the suggested minimum:\n\u201cI think we are still sticking to\u2026two years of [upgrades] and the regular security patch updates for three years,\u201d realme CEO Madhav Sheth told us in an interview.\nHowever, realme is making changes. In March 2022, the company announced that the realme GT 2 and realme GT 2 Pro would see three upgrades and four years of patches. Unfortunately, the company didn\u2019t explicitly state if this was its new universal policy going forward or just a special consideration for these phones. Until we hear differently, assume a realme phone comes with just two upgrades.\nAs of 2025, the GT7 Pro offers four years of upgrades, so the company is slowly improving its policy outlook.\nRedmi\n- Most Redmi phones get one or two upgrades, but the company\u2019s newest phones are seeing increases to that commitment.\nXiaomi sub-brand Redmi makes a whole lot of mid-range and budget phones. As with realme, it should be unsurprising to learn that a company known for very cheap devices doesn\u2019t put too much credence into keeping those phones updated.\nIn the past, it has committed to providing monthly and/or quarterly security updates to a wide range of Redmi-branded phones. The list includes most of the Redmi 7, 8, and 9 families. Unfortunately, the company has made no specific commitments to upgrades and usually supplies two or even just one before shelving the device.\nHowever, in 2022, the company did start being better. Some of its devices saw commitments rise to two or even three years of upgrades. There isn\u2019t much rhyme or reason to which phones do or don\u2019t get this promise, though. With 2024\u2019s launch of the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus, the company is committing to three upgrades and four years of patches for this particular model.\nOne should go into buying a Redmi phone with the knowledge that it is very unlikely you\u2019ll see more than two upgrades during its lifespan.\nSamsung\n- The majority of recent Samsung phones will see four upgrades and five years of patches. Some older phones will see three upgrades and three years of patches. Phones in the Galaxy S24 series are due for seven years of both upgrades and patches. The Galaxy A56 5G, A36 5G, A26 5G, and A16 5G will receive six upgrades and six years of security patches.\nFor years now, Samsung has been the top dog when it comes to global smartphone sales, so naturally, it\u2019s also one of the OEMs with the best support promise for its flagships and mid-range phones. It was briefly knocked off its throne by Google with the Pixel 8 series, but if you\u2019re buying a Galaxy S24, Samsung is promising to match Google\u2019s seven-year commitment. We\u2019re expecting that to apply to other models in the future, and it has already with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6.\nNotably, Samsung also announced the Galaxy A16 5G, which surprisingly offers six years of Android upgrades and security patches. It has since been joined by the And, starting with the Galaxy A56 5G, A36 5G, and A26 5G.\nOnly Google's Pixel 8 series features a better update promise than most Samsung phones.\nOutside of the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung otherwise trumps every OEM except Google, with four years of upgrades and five years of security patches for all its previous phones. That means a Galaxy S23 \u2014 which first shipped with Android 13 \u2014 will see Android 15, Android 16, and even Android 17.\nAs mentioned, Samsung doesn\u2019t lock its promise to premium flagships. The mid-range Galaxy A54 5G gets the same commitment, for example.\nSome phones get a less extensive promise of three years of upgrades and patches. However, when you consider that that\u2019s a better promise than most companies make for even their premium flagships, you start to see just how good Samsung is at this.\nFor a full rundown of all Samsung devices and how long they\u2019ll see updates, consult our guide.\nSony\n- The majority of Sony phones come with two upgrades and two years of patches. Newer flagships, though, do come with better policies.\nIn the world of Android, Sony makes some of the most expensive non-foldable phones. One would think that with the phones costing so much money, Sony\u2019s promises for phone updates would be quite extensive. However, one would be wrong to think that.\nThe Sony Xperia 1 V \u2014 one of its recent flagships \u2014 has no stated update commitment. Before that, the Xperia 1 IV saw two years of upgrades and three years of patches. Going back to even older flagships, the commitment gets worse and weaker. Thankfully, Sony addressed the rot, giving the Xperia VI three upgrades and four years of security patches. That pales in comparison to many, many mid-range phones from the likes of Samsung and Google, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\nRemember that these phones start at a price of at least $1,300. Also, Sony\u2019s phone roster is incredibly small. It\u2019s bizarre that the company can\u2019t even match Samsung\u2019s commitments to its older and budget-level phones.\nHopefully, Sony will eventually up its game here. Until then, buyers who appreciate fast and long-lasting updates should steer clear.\nTCL\n- TCL changes its commitments depending on the phone\u2019s price. However, you shouldn\u2019t expect anything more than two years of support, with some devices only seeing one upgrade in that time.\nTCL says its software update policies typically depend on each individual device. \u201cThere are numerous factors that need to be considered for each device, such as carrier requirements, certifications, chipset software support, and regional needs,\u201d said TCL via email.\nThis open-ended policy makes for a wid variety of commitments. For example, the TCL 40 XE 5G from 2023 has a two-year commitment for patches but no commitment for upgrades, meaning it will never get beyond Android 13. Other devices get one upgrade commitment, with only a select few getting two.\nIn other words, you shouldn\u2019t expect more than two upgrades for a TCL phone. That applies even if you buy one of its most expensive devices. Meanwhile, if you get something more budget-oriented, you should expect just one upgrade \u2014 if that.\nvivo\n- vivo has no firm software support commitment for the majority of its phones. The only exception is the latest vivo X series, but even then, there are a whole lot of caveats.\nIn 2021, vivo made a decent commitment to its newer flagship phones, saying it would deliver three years of upgrades and patches for \u201cselect models\u201d in the vivo X series. We see this commitment still to this day, with the X80 Pro getting a formal commitment to that effect. However, that only applies to devices launched after July 2021 and only applies to select markets.\nDevices that don\u2019t fall under this policy will \u201ccontinue to receive regular Android security updates\u201d for an unknown period of time. Unfortunately, vivo has not yet amended this policy, despite detailed promises from sister brands OPPO and OnePlus.\nNotably, vivo has committed to three upgrades and four years of patches with its X100 Pro, and has bettered this with the X200 Pro. The new phone will see four upgrades and five years of security patches.\nThankfully, vivo does offer a tool that allows you to see what to expect as far as phone updates for any particular model.\nXiaomi\n- Xiaomi has a stated policy of two years of security patches for its phones. However, it has no stated policy for upgrades. It does make exceptions for its premium phones, with older flagships seeing three upgrades and four years of patches. The Xiaomi 15, however, will receive four years of OS updates and six years of patches.\nXiaomi\u2019s stated minimum for phone updates across all its lines is as follows: \u201cWe release monthly and quarterly security patch updates on Xiaomi devices for at least two years after product listing in the marketplace. Monthly and quarterly security updates will include Android security patches released by Google, as well as patches for Xiaomi-specific issues.\u201d\nUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t bring any clarity to Xiaomi\u2019s policy toward upgrades. As with some other vendors on this list, Xiaomi approaches each line on its own to determine its commitment. For example, the company does promise three upgrades and four years of security patches for its flagship Xiaomi 13 lines. The Xiaomi 14 gets a year extra on both OS upgrades and security patches. The Xiaomi 15 kicks this up to four upgrades and six years of security patches. Phones outside of these lines, however, won\u2019t see that extensive of a commitment \u2014 if the company issues a commitment at all.\nZTE\n- Most ZTE phones will see one Android upgrade and the company makes no commitment towards patches.\nA relatively small player on the global stage, ZTE is very vague about its update plans. \u201cZTE has plans to provide major system updates (one update) on flagship products, but the update time depends on the release time of Google\u2019s commercial version,\u201d said the company via email. This doesn\u2019t make us feel too confident about the longevity of its phones.\nIn the case of the ZTE Axon 40 Ultra from 2022, the company didn\u2019t even make a commitment at all, refusing to comment on the matter.\nIn other words, ZTE might be the weakest company on this list when it comes to software support.\nPhone updates: A summary of the industry\nIf you read through this whole list, you\u2019ll notice that only a handful of companies take software updates seriously. Samsung is the leader when it comes to issuing phone updates for a significant period of time on a consistent and frequent basis. Meanwhile, Google sits in a comfortable second place slot. These two companies are neck-and-neck, though.\nOther than those two companies, however, it\u2019s a mixed bag. OnePlus, OPPO, and Xiaomi offer very good update policies, but only for their premium flagships. Motorola is showing a positive trend, even if many of its devices still fall short of its rivals. Mid-rangers and budget models see much weaker promises. Even huge brands like Sony, ASUS, realme, vivo, and TCL can\u2019t meet the bar set by Samsung\u2019s budget lines.\nDoes a company's track record with software updates influence your purchasing decision with new phones?\nThen you have companies like ZTE. More often than not, they simply refuse to make any promises at all. Looking from the top down, you can really see how the Android phone industry is incredibly fragmented when it comes to a standard policy of updates.\nOne thing we haven\u2019t mentioned yet is how Apple treats phone updates. Apple actually trumps most Android brands by offering six years (or more) of upgrades for iPhones. We\u2019d definitely like to see this as a standard across the Android world, too.\nThis would be a universally good thing. It would allow Android users to have the same level of after-purchase support as iOS users, for one. It would also set an example for other Android OEMs and, hopefully, push the idea that weak update commitments are simply not acceptable anymore.\nPhone updates are important and should be treated as such. Someday, we hope this whole list is filled with robust promises from all companies.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nThe best Samsung phones: High-end, mid-range, and entry-level models\nFebruary 8, 2025\nSamsung has been the king of the Android world for years now, and the South Korean giant\u2019s lineup of phones has something for everyone. When deciding the best Samsung phone for you, there are a few things to consider:\n- How far can you stretch your budget?\n- How important is camera performance?\n- Will you use your Samsung phone for gaming or demanding apps?\n- What form factor do you want? Small? Large? Folding?\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what\u2019s important to you, we\u2019ve done the hard work for you. We\u2019ve tested and reviewed literally every Samsung phone on the market, boiling down the options to just six phones. If you want some more insight, check out our detailed buyer\u2019s guide to learn more.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is the best Samsung phone for most people\nNaturally, you\u2019d assume that paying big bucks should award the best phone, but that\u2019s not necessarily true. Look no further than the Galaxy S25 Plus for proof. The middle S25 model is one of the best Android phones you can buy, combining all the best parts of the Galaxy S24 Plus with a price tag that\u2019s much easier to approach than its Ultra-branded sibling.\nThis year, buyers everywhere get the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, specifically tweaked for Samsung\u2019s purposes, and all models are mated to 12GB of RAM \u2014 plenty of juice for apps and games \u2014 and up to 512GB of internal storage. Also, Samsung\u2019s latest Dynamic AMOLED panel is excellent, as always, with the Galaxy S25 Plus sporting a 6.7-inch 120Hz panel. Samsung has also further chiseled away at the phone\u2019s bezels so that it won\u2019t dent your pocket any more than its predecessor, though the sharp, flat frame might not be very comfortable for small hands.\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus also comes preciously close to its largest sibling in terms of battery capacity, landing at 4,900mAh. That\u2019s only a sliver smaller than the Ultra model, which should give the Plus healthy longevity between charges. There\u2019s still no official Qi2 charging from magnets in the Galaxy S25 Plus itself, but you can grab a magnetic case for some level of MagSafe support.\nSamsung\u2019s other big drawcard is its camera hardware, but you\u2019ll have to look long and hard to find any notable upgrades over the outgoing model. The 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto zoom cameras are still here, and they all continue to perform admirably. More interestingly, Samsung has added even more AI-powered capture tools to the bag, including a smart color adjustment system and the ability to cut video clips into a highlight reel automatically.\nOther positives include Samsung\u2019s top-notch software support. The Galaxy S25 Plus offers a seven-year Android update promise, dishing out new One UI builds well into the next decade. Notably, this is a feature across the entire Galaxy S25 series, so don\u2019t make this your primary reason for buying.\nThe best camera phone from Samsung is the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It offers a 200MP main camera, a 50MP ultrawide, a 50MP 5x telephoto, and a 10MP 3x telephoto sensor.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Battery, buffed: The 4,900mAh reservoir is nearly as large as the Ultra\u2019s.\n- Versatile cameras: The tried and tested triple-camera setup is great for almost any situation.\n- Great performance: All buyers can enjoy the pacey Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, along with 12GB of RAM.\n- Gorgeous display: The slightly larger, brighter, and crisp AMOLED screen is easily visible outside, even on sunny days.\n- Software promise: Android manufacturers are taking software updates seriously, and the Galaxy S25 series is the first to benefit.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G offers unbeatable mid-range value\nWe\u2019d recommend the Galaxy A55 ($387 at Amazon) in other regions of the world, but it\u2019s not coming to the US. However, the Galaxy A35 is an admirable and capable mid-range alternative.\nUp front, the phone features a vibrant 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a slathering or Gorilla Glass Victus Plus. Despite its mostly plastic construction, this should give the Galaxy A35 great scratch resistance.\nAt the rear, the phone\u2019s camera array gives it a similar appearance to its more premium siblings, especially the Galaxy S24. It houses a 50MP primary camera, which produces pleasing results in bright and lower light. Color reproduction is another positive, while the lack of motion blur when snapping moving objects is a big surprise. However, the 8MP ultrawide and 5MP macro cameras feel less refined.\nNevertheless, you\u2019ll be soothed by the phone\u2019s excellent battery endurance. With its Exynos 1380 and a 5,000mAh battery, the Galaxy A35 can go well beyond a day with regular use. Once it does run out, you can recharge it at up to 25W with the correct charger.\nThere\u2019s not much to dislike about the Galaxy A35, but the lack of Galaxy AI features may be a sticking point for potential buyers. Additionally, the lack of wireless charging is understandable but unfortunate.\nNevertheless, the Galaxy A35 is the best mid-range Samsung you can purchase in the US. If you live in Europe or India, the Galaxy A55 is a better, albeit pricier, purchase.\nGenerally, most Samsung phones have excellent battery life. But if you were looking for a device that offers a good balance between cost and longevity, the Galaxy A54 5G or Galaxy A35 5G are good choices. Alternatively, the Galaxy S24 Plus is the longest-lasting flagship, according to our tests.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Flagship design: The Galaxy A35 looks so much like its premium siblings that you won\u2019t mind its plastic frame.\n- Great battery life: The Galaxy A35 should last well over a day and a half, even without battery-saving mode enabled.\n- Solid update commitment: Four years of Android version updates and an extra year of security updates are admirable for a mid-range model.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is the power user\u2019s dream phone\nThis is the most powerful Samsung smartphone you can buy, but it won\u2019t necessarily be the best for most people. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a phone for power users who want everything in a handset, bar a foldable display \u2014 though it hasn\u2019t changed too much from its predecessor.\nIn total, the Galaxy S24 Ultra has five cameras. The rear four are headlined by a 200MP main and two telephoto cameras with 50MP 5x zoom and 10MP 3x zoom capabilities, respectively, but most of the love has gone to a new 50MP ultrawide sensor with a shallower depth of field for better light capture. At the front, you\u2019ll find the same 12MP selfie camera used on the last few Ultras. We do have to admit that we miss the 10x telephoto sensor just a little bit, though.\nNevertheless, other things will keep you occupied, including the S Pen tucked away in its dedicated slot, the copious 5,000mAh battery, and the now completely flat 6.8-inch AMOLED screen. Just keep in mind that a phone this large comes with a titanium frame to match, so it\u2019s going to be tough to hold in smaller hands.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Integrated S Pen: If you use it, this can be a game-changer for productivity. Or Candy Crush. Your call.\n- Revamped design: Gone are the rounded sides, but the result is a Galaxy S25 Ultra that looks more like its siblings.\n- Gorgeous screen: The S25 Ultra screen is gorgeous and flat, making S Pen use even more enjoyable.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the best foldable for most people\nFoldable phones are steadily coming into their own, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no exception. It might not be as big of a change as its predecessor, but it raises the Galaxy AI experience in several ways. If you\u2019ve been eyeing a foldable for your next phone, the much larger Flex Window is back again, and it still comes with some of the best widgets you\u2019ll find on a flip phone.\nThe biggest selling point here is still the form factor. Samsung\u2019s clamshell foldable phone still fits comfortably into a pocket (at least most pockets) and opens up to reveal a 6.7-inch AMOLED display. Unfortunately, it still isn\u2019t quite as bright or crisp as a traditional display, but Samsung inches closer and closer every year. However, it\u2019s not as wide as a normal smartphone, which makes it much easier to use with one hand. Of course, the real selling point for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the Flex Window, which looks and feels a lot like the cover screen on the Motorola Razr Plus \u2014 even if it\u2019s not as large. You\u2019ll have to install Good Lock for most app experiences, but then you can open everything from Instagram to Strava on the 3.4-inch panel.\nSamsung has also upgraded the software features that you can tap into on the Flex Window with a brand-new Auto Zoom mode for the dual cameras. Essentially, it uses Galaxy AI to track you, the subject, through the field of view, automatically adjusting the zoom from 0.5x up to 3x for a more convenient selfie.\nSpeaking of the camera, the Z Flip 6 is certainly a capable shooter, and it finally has a new primary sensor. Samsung swapped the previous 12.5MP primary camera for a new 50MP version, once again paired with a 12MP ultrawide camera to fit more in your frame. The setup does serve as a great selfie alternative, though. Apart from group selfies using the Flex Mode, the screen on the front can also serve as a viewfinder, which allows you to take selfies with larger, more capable external cameras.\nApart from that, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a great little phone \u2014 even if I didn\u2019t expect to like it at first. Performance is stellar thanks to the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy. Battery life is about the same as its predecessor, which makes sense when you pair the upgraded processor with a more demanding cover display. It\u2019s still limited compared to traditional phones, but it\u2019s enough for a typical day. It took a little over an hour to charge while plugged in or an hour and a half wirelessly. Once again, though, there\u2019s no charger in the box.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Flex Window: Samsung\u2019s larger cover screen allows for much more in-depth app experiences and better widgets.\n- Very pocketable: The small size fits easily in pockets and purses and is great for one-handed use.\n- Premium materials: Samsung\u2019s combination of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is as tough as they come.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the best tablet replacement\nWhile the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a productivity powerhouse, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 takes things to the next level by unfolding into a bright, sharp, 120Hz 7.6-inch tablet. To sweeten the deal, the interior screen is compatible with an S Pen, although there isn\u2019t one included in the box. However, unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung\u2019s book-style foldable has a few new design upgrades to mention\nThe large interior screen is obviously the big selling point here, but the rest of the phone is top-notch, too. Samsung finally squared off the external display, making it feel a bit larger and wider for use when closed. This year\u2019s cameras are about the same as the previous setup, once again rolling with a 50MP primary camera, 10MP telephoto, and a 12MP ultrawide for good measure. The interior screen has an under-display camera to minimize its visual impact, but it has remained essentially unchanged since Samsung introduced it a few years back.\nOn the performance side, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy is more than powerful enough for smooth and consistent performance on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, even on the larger screen. Battery life is once again good enough but not incredible, mostly due to the additional display real estate and relatively small 4,400mAh cell. It took nearly an hour and a half to charge the Galaxy Z Fold 5 from dead to full, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 once again tops out at 25W wired speeds.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- It folds: The phone opens into a very nice 7.6-inch tablet.\n- S Pen compatibility: Get even more out of your phone with an S Pen (sold separately).\n- Great software: Android 14 has been optimized for larger devices, providing a much better experience.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE offers affordable flagship performance\nSamsung\u2019s Fan Edition family has been on an interesting journey. After landing among the best phones of the year with the Galaxy S20 FE, the follow-up Galaxy S21 FE felt like a case of too little, too late. Now, Samsung is back to recapture some of its early success with yet another mid-ranger, the Galaxy S24 FE. On the surface, it follows the Fan Edition formula to the letter, but under the hood, it delivers much, much more.\nFor starters, the Galaxy S24 FE certainly looks the part. It\u2019s almost identical to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus, swapping frosted rear glass for a glossy panel but otherwise matching the refined design language. The Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s 6.7-inch AMOLED panel stands much larger than its smallest flagship cousin, offering plenty of real estate for games or streaming. This year, the phone is also sandwiched with panes of Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the front and back \u2014 a sizable upgrade over the previous Gorilla Glass 5.\nOf course, in order for Samsung to keep the Galaxy S24 FE more affordable than its proper flagship lineup, there are a few sacrifices under the hood. It swaps the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy for the in-house Exynos 2400e pairs it with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Both the RAM and storage are in line with what we expect for the money, though the drop from a Snapdragon chipset to an Exynos one isn\u2019t as steep as some might have guessed.\nUltimately, the Galaxy S24 FE comes in as one of Samsung\u2019s best offerings. It\u2019s a better value than its predecessor, while also giving its flagship family members a run for their money thanks to its price point of under $700. You might have to get used to slightly less flexible cameras, but we\u2019d say they\u2019re worth it.\nBefore you rush out to pick one up, however, Samsung recently announced the Galaxy S24 FE. It\u2019s slightly larger than this model and comes with an Exynos processor standard across the board. We\u2019re still in the process of reviewing Samsung\u2019s latest mid-range offering, and we\u2019ll be sure to update this entry with our thoughts as soon as we finish our testing.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- High-end style: The Galaxy S24 FE picks up right where Samsung\u2019s flagships left off, pairing glossy front and back panels with a squared-off frame.\n- Flexible cameras: A classic wide/ultrawide/telephoto trio means the Galaxy S24 FE packs a wide zoom range and offers support for Expert RAW without the flagship price tag, though you\u2019ll be missing a few megapixels.\n- Updated connectivity: The Galaxy S24 FE supports modern standards, including Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6e, and NFC for mobile payments.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is great for people on a tight budget\nFinally, we have the best Samsung phone for those on a budget. The Galaxy A15 5G is a step up from the Galaxy A14 it replaces, and bags an excellent 6.5-inch 90Hz AMOLED screen, a MediaTek Dimensity 6100 Plus SoC, and a 5,000mAh battery with 25W charging.\nIt also includes a capable 50MP main camera, which is dragged down by its 5MP ultrawide and 2MP macro companions. Most cheap Samsung phones have underwhelming cameras, and all three have problems. However, it\u2019s a reasonable performer for its price.\nYes, the Galaxy A15 is on the lower end of Samsung\u2019s spectrum, but it\u2019s a great smartphone for the money. Perhaps the best part of the Galaxy A14 is its price, which should keep your wallet happy.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Incredible value: The sub-$200 price tag is just right.\n- Great battery life: This phone is a true battery champion thanks to its low power hardware.\n- Headphone jack: Yes, Samsung still has one or two models with a headphone jack in 2024.\nWhat we look for in the best Samsung phones\nWe\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of Android phones over the years here at Android Authority, so we\u2019ve developed a keen eye for what you look for in a smartphone. If you\u2019re thinking of picking up a Samsung phone specifically, here\u2019s what to look for:\nLook for value\nIt\u2019s tempting to jump right for the most expensive Galaxy S25 Ultra or Z Fold 6, but these phones offer much more than most users will ever need. For that reason, we recommend the S25 Plus from the premium lineup since it hits the best price-to-performance ratio. Likewise for budget devices like the A25 5G and A35 5G.\nConsistent software\nSamsung phones all use the company\u2019s in-house One UI software, which is a slightly tweaked version of Android with extra features. They also all offer four years of version updates and five years of security updates, so even the cheapest phones will remain up to date for a long time. However, phones on the low end will show their age much sooner.\nVersatile cameras\nNowadays, megapixel counts don\u2019t mean nearly as much as software smarts, but Samsung phones are generally great performers. They all tend towards heavier saturation in photos, for better or worse. However, rather than looking for high MP counts, we recommend looking for phones with dedicated ultrawide and telephoto lenses where possible. The added versatility is a big plus in your mobile photography kit.\nBuild materials and design\nPrice is generally the deciding factor in how good a phone\u2019s build quality is, but there are a few things to look out for. For example, Gorilla Glass Victus and Gorilla Armor are much more resistant than Gorilla Glass 5, although you\u2019ll still probably want to get a case if you want it to last. Camera housings are another contentious issue design-wise, but if you are going to get a case, you won\u2019t even notice it.\nOther FAQs\nSamsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S25 series offers the best mix of performance and discounts heading into the first few months of 2025. Some people may also prefer the cutting-edge design of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6, and the midrange Galaxy A series is impressive without the high cost.\nThe Galaxy A35 is perhaps the best value you can get in a Samsung phone right now. It offers three rear cameras, a large 5,000mAh battery, and a solid 6.6-inch Full HD Plus display for just $399.\nIt\u2019s tough to find a better value than ordering from Samsung itself. Amazon may offer faster shipping, but the Samsung website usually offers the best trade-in values and additional perks. For example, the Galaxy S25 series offered pre-order benefits that included double storage and $50 off for those who reserved their phone.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is among the best budget phones you can buy. It offers a large, crisp display, 5G speeds, and a powerful triple-camera setup for $399.\nThe best Samsung phone for seniors is the Samsung Galaxy Folder 2. It\u2019s an affordable flip phone with a 3.8-inch screen, rear and selfie cameras, and a keyboard.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nI've always been more of a Flip fan, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has won me over\nAugust 14, 2025\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nMSRP: $1,999.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nI\u2019ve been on board with foldable phones since the start, but I\u2019ve always preferred flip phones. To me, it\u2019s always made so much more sense to reach for a tiny phone that opens into the size of a regular phone, than a regular phone that folds out into a pseudo-tablet. I\u2019d fight for the chance to review Galaxy Z Flips and Motorola Razrs, and I\u2019d always keep a close eye on the likes of the OPPO Find N Flip and other non-US releases just to see what the rest of the world is cooking up. And while I\u2019ve liked some book-style foldables over the years, I\u2019d never tested one that convinced me I\u2019d want to use one over a clamshell.\nThen, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 came along.\nAt first, I was underwhelmed by the idea of trying another one of Samsung\u2019s brand-new book-style foldable phones. I figured it would be more of the same, with an inconvenient cover screen and an inner display I could never find the best use for. But, to be open-minded, I decided to take it on anyway. I\u2019m glad I did, because this thing is a marvel in (almost) every way.\nIf feeling is believing, then I\u2019m a Believer\nAs I said above, the book-style form factor never really made sense to me when it came to foldable phones. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around a much too narrow cover display that opened into a not quite wide enough internal display and expected me to use it like a pocket-sized tablet. Sure, a few foldables have slightly shifted my perspective, like the excellent Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the aging, but once great OnePlus Open, but I\u2019ve still always made my way back to either a small Android phone or a flip phone \u2014 sorry, not sorry.\nBut now, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 finally feels like it\u2019s found the right balance. It has a cover display that feels like a normal-sized Android phone, swapping the Fold 6\u2019s weird 22.1:9 aspect ratio for a much more comfortable 21:9. I know, it barely sounds like a change, but the result is a slightly shorter, slightly wider display that\u2019s so much more comfortable to type on and use in my day-to-day life. If they say that the best phone is the one you have on you, this singular change has done more for the Galaxy Z Fold lineup than any other, in my opinion.\nOf course, it\u2019s not just the shift in aspect ratio that makes the Galaxy Z Fold 7 feel better. I\u2019ll come back to the upgraded pair of displays in a second, but first, I have to talk about just how incredibly thin this foldable phone is. It toes the line between engineering marvel and recipe for disaster, and I\u2019ve swung back and forth on just how I feel about Samsung\u2019s ambition.\nOn the one hand, yes, it\u2019s incredible. When unfolded, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more than a millimeter thinner than Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Edge, and it almost has to be felt to be believed. I\u2019ll occasionally find myself sitting and looking at the side profile of the Fold 7, simply wondering how Samsung made it happen. However, with that great thinness comes great responsibility. I just as often find myself scared to open the Galaxy Z Fold 7 because it\u2019s almost too thin. I wasn\u2019t blessed with nimble fingers, so I frequently fumble while opening the phone. To my credit, I\u2019ve only dropped it once, but I\u2019m starting to see why other users have put grip tape on the edges to have something to hold onto.\nThankfully, despite the brief dance with doom, my Galaxy Z Fold 7 shows no signs of wear. Its Advanced Armor Aluminum frame brushed off my clumsiness, and the combination of Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the cover display and Victus 2 on the back panel looked like nothing had happened. And, with how thin this foldable phone is, I couldn\u2019t be more relieved.\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 7 has reached a point where I\u2019m convinced that any proper tumble would spell doom for more than one side. It barely has bezels around the 6.5-inch cover display, and the frame is barely thick enough to house its USB-C port or volume rocker and power button, so all it would take is one tough fall to beat up the phone front, back, and sideways. At the very least, the Fold 7\u2019s IP48 rating against water and dust should have my back in case my next hypothetical accident happens at the beach, though I\u2019ll have to hope it happens in the water rather than on land.\nToo slim or not, the Galaxy Z Fold 7's design feels downright remarkable.\nBut, since we\u2019re all still happily in one piece, let\u2019s go back to talking about Samsung\u2019s displays, because they\u2019re excellent, as expected. The 6.5-inch external Dynamic AMOLED panel is just the right size for almost everything, falling comfortably between the Galaxy S25 and the S25 Plus, offering enough real estate for scrolling social media, dipping back into Pok\u00e9mon Go, and typing out a quick text message without feeling too overbearing. Honestly, I could probably get away with using the cover screen for 90% of my day-to-day tasks and call it one of the best Samsung phones has ever made.\nThat would be doing a disservice to Samsung\u2019s newly upgraded 8.0-inch foldable Dynamic AMOLED on the inside, though. At long last, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a nearly square 6:5 aspect ratio, making it much more comfortable to use vertically and horizontally. It feels almost like two complete Galaxy phones stuck together rather than one and a half that leaves you wondering how to split your workload. And, with a slightly wider display to work with, I\u2019m finding that far more apps play nicely around the still-visible crease than ever before.\nAlso, I just said that the hinge crease is still visible \u2014 it\u2019s really still there, but I don\u2019t mind. These days, it\u2019s a wide, shallow crease like the gap between two sides of an American highway rather than a deep, narrow trench that you need mountaineering equipment to cross. I don\u2019t mind swiping my finger across it anymore, perhaps because everything else feels like such a step forward.\nOne thing that\u2019s not so much of a step forward, though, is the Galaxy Z Fold 7\u2019s S Pen support \u2014 or the lack thereof. After several years of supporting an external stylus, Samsung\u2019s latest foldable no longer has the required digitizer layer, which means we can add the S Pen to the pile of retired features, along with the waterfall display, the headphone jack, and the removable battery. I wasn\u2019t the biggest user of the S Pen \u2014 I don\u2019t like to carry anything other than earbuds with my phone \u2014 but I don\u2019t love the idea of stripping productivity features in the name of thinness, especially when a stylus makes more sense here on the larger screen than it does on the Ultra range.\nSurprise, surprise, the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is an All-Star\nWhile it\u2019s safe to say that Samsung has made the biggest fuss about its major Galaxy Z Fold 7 facelift, there\u2019s just as much to talk about with what\u2019s going on under the hood. Specifically, it\u2019s time to dig into what\u2019s changed \u2014 and what hasn\u2019t \u2014 to fit within the incredibly slim aluminum frame. Surprisingly, the answer is very little, for better or worse. In almost all ways, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is outfitted like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 that came before it, but it\u2019s taken some Ozempic and called it diet and exercise.\nThat means you still get the same solid RAM and storage options. Like last year, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 kicks off with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but you can bump things up to 1TB if you need the extra space. If you do, you\u2019ll get a matching bump in RAM, pushing up to 16GB for the most powerful of power users. Regardless of your configuration, you\u2019ll get Qualcomm\u2019s top-end Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, an overclocked 3nm chip that\u2019s the same as Samsung used for its traditional Galaxy S25 series.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is stacked up like an Ultra, but its slim chassis makes me nervous about performance under stress.\nIn most cases, that identical hardware would make you think the Galaxy Z Fold 7 should perform just like its non-folding cousins. However, its ultra-slim form factor suggests limited room for cooling technology, resulting in a faster drop in performance under heavy load. To find out whether Samsung\u2019s latest book-style foldable phone falls into more of column A or column B, I did what I always do: I put it through all of the stress testing its little aluminum body could handle.\nI fired up everything from the CPU-intensive Geekbench 6 and PC Mark Work 3.0 tests to the GPU-heavy Wild Life and Wild Life Extreme tests and compared the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to its closest rivals, both folding and traditional. That meant stacking it against the previous Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro Fold (the nearest other book-style foldable in the US for now), as well as the two members of the Galaxy S25 family that come anywhere close in terms of price: The Edge and the Ultra.\nIn both CPU-heavy tests, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 performs just as I\u2019d expect it to \u2014 settling just ahead of its predecessor and within striking distance of Samsung\u2019s more traditional flagships. It\u2019s also comfortably ahead of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with its in-house Tensor G4 chip, whether in single or multi-core performance. The gap between the Fold 6 and Fold 7 is negligible on the more comprehensive PCMark Work test, which feels like a pretty good indicator that my concerns about cooling were spot on.\nOn the GPU side, the Fold 7 lands closer to its siblings, following almost the same curve for 20 runs. It starts where expected \u2014 above its predecessor \u2014 and stays there for the Wild Life test, but falls behind the Galaxy Z Fold 6 on the Wild Life Extreme side. That said, I\u2019d probably give the Galaxy Z Fold 7 slightly more credit for a more consistent run overall, as the Fold 6 takes a deeper drop around the sixth run before recovering ten runs later, while the Fold 7 slowly tapers from start to finish. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold turned in the worst (but most consistent) performance over 20 runs, which is nice for the Tensor\u2019s reliability but shows just how far behind Google can be in the hunt for raw power.\nOur testing has proven that Samsung is not sacrificing power for its slimmed-down chassis.\nOverall, the Galaxy Z Fold 7\u2019s benchmarks are what I expected for a one-year upgrade. They\u2019re largely better than the Galaxy Z Fold 6\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, while the updated form factor prevents the phone from being a runaway powerhouse like the top-end Galaxy S25 Ultra. If nothing else, I\u2019m glad Samsung has proven that it\u2019s not sacrificing power for its slimmed-down chassis.\nIn everyday life, though, I can safely say I don\u2019t care about the Galaxy Z Fold 7\u2019s cooling issues, performance gap, or anything else, really, because it\u2019s simply a blast to use. Yes, I spend a lot of my time on the 6.5-inch cover screen \u2014 my colleague Megan Ellis inspired me to pick Pok\u00e9mon Go back up after a casual four years away \u2014 but the Fold has handled the GPU-heavy (and GPS-heavy) title like a champ. But, as good as the game is on the cover screen, it\u2019s also a reminder that not everything has been optimized for the inner display. It wants to add height to the layout to match the increased width, resulting in an interface that feels just a little bit squished.\nIn most other cases, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 finally feels ready for the big screen. I used it as my go-to display for following the Women\u2019s Euros soccer tournament while out and about, and I\u2019m so glad that YouTube\u2019s default interface finally pushes the picture to one side of the crease when I have the phone folded at a 90-degree angle. Samsung\u2019s revamped split screen mode in One UI 8 also means I can take way more control over the internal display, giving one app \u2014 usually Gmail or Slack \u2014 most of my real estate to type out a message or keep up with ideas between matches.\nSpeaking of One UI 8, I have to say that this is Samsung at its software best. Does it feel massively different? No, not really, but it does feel more refined, and the Galaxy AI features are finally reaching a point of some maturity. I love the updates from the Now Bar, usually preseason scores from the earliest Premier League warmups or the first few weeks of the NFL, yet I would be just as happy if I never saw a Now Brief update again. Despite launching with the Galaxy S25 series, I\u2019ve yet to find a use for the all-in-one overview, usually because I keep all of my relevant widgets on my home screen as it is, so I don\u2019t need to open an app to see the weather and my upcoming appointments.\nOne UI 8 is Samsung at its software best.\nAnd, since we\u2019re talking about my widgets of choice, this is where I should mention that I\u2019m far, far too scared to try DIY Home on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. I know it\u2019s one of the more unique parts of Good Lock, and it allows your creative mind to run free, but I could barely make things look presentable on a single display, let alone a cover display and a folding one. If you cook up a great interface, I\u2019d love to see it, but I won\u2019t be jumping up to replicate it with any great hurry.\nMoving on, the biggest thing I think Samsung missed by sticking with so much of the Galaxy Z Fold 6\u2019s infrastructure is that the battery and charging setup on this $2,000 foldable is\u2026 not great. Despite other new Android phones switching to silicon-carbon cells, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 still packs the same 4,400mAh capacity as its predecessor, just squeezed even thinner to fit in the new body. And usually, keeping one spec the same while limiting another (in this case, cooling technology) is a recipe for some trouble, as we discovered above.\nIn our testing, though, the Fold 7\u2019s battery isn\u2019t quite as much of a cause for concern as I expected. It not only sticks with its predecessor \u2014 besting it in four of our six categories \u2014 but it also beats the Galaxy S25 Edge in every section save for 4K recording. I\u2019m slightly surprised by how close the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold results are, but I suppose when a star (or Tensor chip) burns half as bright, it can go a little bit longer.\nMy day-to-day experience with the Fold 7 just about mimicked the controlled testing, which is more good news. The foldable seems most comfortable with a healthy mix of tasks, allowing me to bounce from light gaming to Spotify streaming to the football highlights I mentioned above without breaking much of a sweat. Perhaps its most impressive feat was acting as my copilot for a four and a half hour drive from my adopted home of Baltimore to upstate New York for a weekend camping with my family. The Fold 7 handled all the Google Maps navigation I could throw at it while barely heating up, provided I kept it in the shade of my car.\nWhile the Fold\u2019s battery life was better than expected, its charging setup is anything but. The lowly 25W maximum is the same as you can get from the Galaxy A16 5G \u2014 a phone that costs one-tenth of the money. It\u2019s no better than the base Galaxy S25 and is slower than what Motorola has added to its 2025 Moto G Power and Moto G Stylus launches. At this price point, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 deserves at least 45W wired charging to put it on par with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nIn practice, at least the small battery means a capable USB PD PPS charger can get the phone back up and running in about 80 minutes. That\u2019s quick enough for most people \u2014 I certainly haven\u2019t felt tethered to the wall for too long \u2014 but it\u2019s more of a case of limited capacity than impressive charging speeds. I was somewhat surprised to see the Fold take a full 15 minutes longer than the Edge to reach 100%, though I have to guess the difference comes down to throttling for the last 500mAh. If you prefer wireless charging, the Fold 7\u2019s 15W rate isn\u2019t bad, but there are no built-in Qi2 magnets, so you\u2019ll have to pick up a Qi2 Ready case if you want to use certain accessories.\nAccidentally in Love with Samsung\u2019s upgraded cameras\nSamsung has been using the tagline \u201cUltra Unfolds\u201d for a lot of its Galaxy Z Fold 7 marketing, and when you draw parallels to the top-end Galaxy S25 Ultra, you start to expect certain things. Usually, you\u2019d go to a big battery and fast charging \u2014 well, you\u2019d think so, anyway \u2014 but you\u2019d also expect Ultra-tier Android camera phones. Although the Galaxy Z Fold 7 whiffs on the first two points, it more than nails the third, packing a camera setup that would have probably saved the Galaxy S25 Edge in my eyes.\nIt starts incredibly strongly, using the same 200MP primary camera that Samsung chose for its traditional Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S25 Edge, and delivers the same ultra-sharp results you\u2019d expect. Its wide \u0192/1.7 aperture lets in a ton of light, giving me a beautifully shallow depth of field in portrait mode, but also offering really good natural bokeh when I pick out a well-defined subject. I\u2019m usually comfortable letting it bin down to much more manageable 12MP photos by default, too, but I appreciate having the option to tap into the full resolution as needed, massive final files and all.\nThe 200MP primary camera is a nice touch, but I'm ready for Samsung to go full Ultra with the Fold series.\nThe Fold\u2019s 12MP ultrawide camera keeps it almost on par with its most expensive siblings, too. It\u2019s the same sensor that Samsung chose for the Edge and an upgrade over the previous Galaxy Z Fold 6, offering larger megapixels that let in just a little bit more light despite its slightly narrower 120-degree field of view. I wish Samsung had continued with its proper Ultra approach, packing a 50MP ultrawide sensor into its thicker camera bump, but at least I know this sensor is as tried and true as Samsung has.\nWhat puts the ultra-expensive Fold ahead of its still-very-expensive Edge sibling, though, is its third camera: The 10MP 3x optical telephoto sensor. It\u2019s as close as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has to a holdover from its predecessor, and it lets the phone punch in for up to 30x zoom with a little bit of processing help from the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The results are okay at that range, but it\u2019s still better than the Edge\u2019s unfortunate limit of 10x magnification.\nWith all of that out of the way, let\u2019s check out some camera samples:\nYes, I know that this first row of camera samples hits the greens and yellows pretty heavily, but this is Samsung we\u2019re talking about \u2014 green will always be a highlight. Besides, in each case, I think the shade of green makes each shot look better without looking quite so punchy. In the case of the flowers, it adds just enough sharpness to the leaves that surround the bright blooms, while the green leaves and needles glow in the golden hour view of the trail in the middle. If you\u2019ll forgive the\u2026 I don\u2019t know, pirate face, that my brother is pulling off, I think Samsung once again nailed the golden hour look, putting a halo around his hair without darkening his face or any of his details. Just know it\u2019s as close to a personality shot as I\u2019ve ever captured of anyone I know.\nThis time around, Samsung\u2019s portrait mode is on full display. It perfectly captured the wispy edges of my friend\u2019s dog, Mack, while also separating the reddish beer on the right from the other mix of browns, pinks, and tans behind it. Perhaps the only image in this gallery I\u2019m not sold on is the one of my aunts around the campfire. Although the Galaxy Z Fold 7 captured a ton of light, it put some heavy Galaxy AI processing over the finer details in their faces and clothes, making it so the closer you look, the more cartoonish they appear. I would have preferred a less-sharp image with more natural details over this heavy-handed processing, no question.\nSwitching to the ultrawide focal length, I have to admit that I\u2019ve changed in the last few years. I used to hate any and all things ultrawide, thinking that the field of view and distortion made everything look, well, awful, but now it might be the sensor I use most. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that some of my Gen Z friends communicate exclusively in 0.5x selfies, or maybe it\u2019s the fact that Samsung\u2019s colors are just as punchy while adding character to otherwise everyday images. The shot looking up at the treetops reminds me of the cover art for Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 album Punisher, while the effect on the Volkswagen camper van makes it look just a little bit cartoonish in a good way.\nTo see how the Galaxy Z Fold 7\u2019s new primary sensor would pair up with its 3x optical telephoto camera, I did what I often do: I headed to the harbor and looked for a cargo ship. The Fold was rock-solid at shorter focal lengths, just like I thought it would be, turning in sharp results from 1x zoom to where the telephoto sensor took over at 3x zoom. I noticed what seemed to be a shift in the color of the harbor water itself around 3x zoom, as well as a similar shift in the color of the sky. I\u2019m not sure exactly where that comes from, as the processing flips back to the original color profile for the longer focal lengths from 10x to 30x zoom. The details are still pretty good out of the Fold at 10x, too, but they look a little more AI-enhanced once I jump beyond that point, especially in the letters on the side of the ship.\nThe last piece of Samsung\u2019s reworked camera setup is its \u201csame, same, but different\u201d approach to selfies. Yes, the front-facing 10MP selfie sensor is still there, but I believe it\u2019s the least exciting camera of the five. The main reason I think it\u2019s so underwhelming is that Samsung has finally given up on its quest to make the under-display camera sensor a thing. The lowly, unimpressive 4MP camera is a thing of the past, having been replaced by a much more normal (and much more useful) 10MP punch hole.\nI feel comfortable using it when I have the phone open, and it feels like a much better alternative than holding the unfolded display to use the rear cameras for selfies. That said, you won\u2019t beat a selfie from a 200MP sensor with a just-wide-enough field of view \u2014 just be ready to wipe a few fingerprints off the internal display.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much difference between the two punch hole cameras, save for the field of view. The details are about the same, the colors are about the same, and the portrait mode processing is, too. However, neither one can compete with the power of a 200MP selfie camera. The shadows in my shirt are deeper, the colors are slightly more vivid, and my face is redder \u2014 well, that last one probably isn\u2019t a good thing. I\u2019m not sure why that\u2019s the case, either, as the rest of the color recreation skews more blue. It\u2019s a trade I\u2019m willing to make, as I can probably correct the white balance with just a few seconds in the settings menu to keep the top-notch details.\nYou can also check out full-resolution versions of these photos (and several more) at this Google Drive link.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7's camera setup has a long list of editing tricks.\nOn the video side, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 picks up right where its predecessor left off, supporting up to 8K resolution at 30 or 4K at 60 frames per second. If you want to go slow mo, you can try 1080p at 240 frames per second or 720p at 960 frames per second. I\u2019m not a huge smartphone video shooter \u2014 I\u2019m rarely going to go back and rewatch my clips \u2014 but I\u2019ve come away impressed with what the Fold 7 can do. Its stabilization is excellent, and I love the added security of folding the phone to 90 degrees for a better grip.\nOne more piece of the Galaxy Z Fold 7\u2019s camera setup to highlight is its long list of editing tricks. I particularly like that Photo Assist now gives you side-by-side previews before you confirm your edit, letting you double-check that you have every last detail spot-on. Samsung\u2019s camera roll feature is helpful, too, showing you the last few shots you took in a photobooth-like scroll. It\u2019s made capturing pet photos significantly easier, as I can look back to see if there\u2019s any motion blur before I trust that I got the shot.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review verdict: Held out for a hero\nAfter so many years of iteration, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is Samsung\u2019s first book-style foldable that has sold the whole concept of the series to me. It finally has the right aspect ratio to make it comfortable, whether open or closed, and the overall fit and finish are good enough to draw my eye away from my beloved clamshells. I no longer feel like I\u2019m carrying a too-tall, too-thin slab with an inner display that I can\u2019t find a use for, and it makes me want to explore the book-style form factor that much more.\nCalling back to Samsung\u2019s \u201cUltra Unfolds\u201d tagline, I\u2019m ready to say it\u2019s the truth. No, it\u2019s not always true \u2014 pay no attention to the battery and charging setup behind the curtain \u2014 but in terms of power, camera flexibility, and software support, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a winner. It still makes me smile when I toss two full-sized apps onto the 8-inch folding display, and I could easily spend most of my time with the 200MP primary sensor and only the 200MP primary sensor \u2014 even though I don\u2019t have to. And, with seven years of software updates in the pipeline, I can at least put a silver lining around the elephant in the room.\nYes, it\u2019s time to address what I\u2019ve been dreading: Samsung\u2019s pricing is headed in the wrong direction. After years of slowly but surely working the Galaxy Z Fold to a more palatable price, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is back up to the $2,000 barrier. No matter who you are, that\u2019s a lot of money. That\u2019s a 14-inch, M4-powered MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That\u2019s the Nintendo Switch 2 with nearly two dozen full-priced games. Personally, that\u2019s just more than I think I can recommend you, or anyone, spend on a phone.\nBesides, when you\u2019re pairing that sky-high price with limiting factors like a just-okay IP48 rating, 25W wired charging, and an overall design so thin that it almost works against itself, it becomes much harder to find the value behind the power. For everything you come to love about the phone, you\u2019ll be just as annoyed when it jumps out of your hands or when it takes just a little bit too long to get back up and running. And, if you don\u2019t spend a good chunk of every day on the internal display, you\u2019ll probably wonder why you didn\u2019t just buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra in the first place.\nSpeaking of the Ultra, that\u2019s probably the number one phone I\u2019d tell you to look at if you\u2019re not sold on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. No, it\u2019s not nearly as exciting \u2014 I, in fact, said it doesn\u2019t feel that special anymore \u2014 but it\u2019s still as reliable as they come. Its 45W wired charging is much faster than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, while its 5,000mAh battery will last much longer. Toss in an even more flexible four-camera setup and pair it with a built-in S Pen, and I\u2019d probably say the Galaxy S25 Ultra ($1299.99 at Amazon) is Samsung\u2019s best phone for productivity.\nIf you\u2019re at this point in the review and cannot get over the Fold 7\u2019s sky-high price but still want a foldable, I have other options for you. First, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 ($1899.99 at Samsung). I\u2019ve spent plenty of time comparing this foldable to its predecessor, and I still think it\u2019s a worthwhile pickup in 2025. No, its cover screen might not be as comfortable, but its cameras are just about as flexible, and its continued software updates mean that the day-to-day experience will feel almost identical. And, with matching battery and charging setups, you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re missing as much by not spending $2,000, as long as you don\u2019t mind a slightly thicker (and easier to open) phone.\nThe other seemingly obvious alternative is the Galaxy Z Flip 7 ($1099.99 at Amazon), and you already know I\u2019m a flip phone guy. I\u2019ve been eyeing the larger Flex Window that finally stretches around the dual cameras, and the seven years of updates are, of course, very welcome. But this year\u2019s edition didn\u2019t wow us. My colleague Joe Maring tested it thoroughly, and despite being a fellow clamshell-enjoyer, he wasn\u2019t impressed by the cover screen\u2019s overreliance on Good Lock, the downgraded performance, and the slow (and hot) charging. Instead, the superb Motorola Razr Ultra ($1099.99 at Amazon) is still our top pick if you want a flip foldable.\nOtherwise, Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro Fold ($1799 at Amazon) is the Galaxy Z Fold\u2019s only other competition in the US. Of course, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is set to launch in less than a week, so I wouldn\u2019t blame you for waiting to pull the trigger on the Fold until you see what Google has been cooking, and with the OnePlus Open overdue for a successor, it\u2019s Google or nothing as far as rivals go anyway. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will also be your best bet for a brand-new Google-flavored foldable since our dreams of a Pixel Flip are still just that.\nSo, until I get Google\u2019s take on my favorite form factor, I just might keep the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in my pocket \u2014 and that\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d say.\n- Incredible slimline design\n- Improved internal display\n- Solid performance\n- Good enough battery life\n- Flexible cameras\n- Excellent update commitment\n- No S Pen support\n- Lame wired charging speeds\n- Prohibitively expensive\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nGoogle is turning Circle to Search into the game guru you never knew you needed\nJuly 9, 2025\n- Google is introducing gaming help for Circle to Search.\n- Players can now use the feature to get tips or learn more about a title when gaming on mobile.\n- The feature is designed to help you find tips related to your exact spot in the game.\nWhether you\u2019re an expert gamer or not, it\u2019s easy for any player to find themselves stuck in a game. Thankfully, there\u2019s no shortage of walkthroughs and strategy guides to turn to on the internet. While you previously had to search for this help manually, you\u2019ll now be able to let Circle to Search do the work for you.\nDuring Galaxy Unpacked, it was announced that Circle to Search is gaining a new ability. Google is introducing gaming help to Android\u2019s AI-powered search feature. As the company explains, you\u2019ll now be able to get tips, identify a new character, and find winning strategies by using Circle to Search. This new function is designed to help you find tips related to wherever you are in the game.\nIf you follow our APK teardowns, you may remember that Android Authority first spotted Circle to Search\u2019s Game Help feature back in January. At the time, it appeared as a chip above the search box, with the text \u201cGet Game Help.\u201d Tapping on the chip takes a screenshot of where you are in the game and adds the text \u201cGet help with this game\u201d to perform a quick Google Search.\nIt goes without saying that the results you get from this feature will likely vary. If Google Search doesn\u2019t recognize the context of the screenshot, you\u2019ll likely need to refine the search as you would normally do when performing a search manually. Regardless, it\u2019s a nice addition to Circle to Search\u2019s growing list of capabilities.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nPixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL debut as Google's most ambitious lineup yet\nAugust 20, 2025\nYear after year, Google has given us good reason to consider its latest Pixel lineup among the best Android phones you can buy. And while the company pushes both its hardware and software to new limits with each subsequent generation, this year, the Pixel 10 series has got to represent one of the biggest, boldest steps forward for the phones yet.\nOnce again, we\u2019ve got four new additions to the Pixel family to check out, with the launch of the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. We\u2019re giving the new foldable some special attention of its own, but right now, let\u2019s break down exactly what you can expect from the three new traditional models forming this year\u2019s Pixel lineup.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nExcellent cameras\nPowerful AI tools\nTop-notch software\nBest specs and AI features\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Release date, price, and availability\n- Google Pixel 10 (128GB): $799 / \u00a3799\n- Google Pixel 10 (256GB): $899 / \u00a3899\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (128GB): $999 / \u00a3999\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (256GB): $1,099 / \u00a3,1,099\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (512GB): $1,219 / \u00a31,219\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (1TB): $1,449 / \u00a31,449\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (256GB): $1,199 / \u00a31,199\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (512GB): $1,319 / \u00a31,319\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (1TB): $1,549 / \u00a31,549\nWe\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting the Pixel 10 series for ages now, and back in July, Google finally set the date for this season\u2019s Made By Google event. Today, with August 20 finally rolling around, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s chance to officially check out the new family, with Google showing them all off at its Brooklyn launch extravaganza.\nWhile this year introduces some important changes for the hardware that make up Google\u2019s Pixel phones, pricing is blessedly remaining consistent with last year\u2019s Pixel 9 devices, starting at just under $800 for the 128GB base model \u2014 and moving up from there.\nPre-orders for the new handsets open up today, so if you like what you see here, you don\u2019t have to waste any time getting the ball rolling on making a Pixel 10 model your next daily driver. For all three of these non-folding Pixels, regular retail availability kicks off next week, on August 28.\nGoogle is once again making its latest Pixel phones available to global audiences, kicking sales of the Pixel 10 series off in all the usual markets, with the addition of Mexico this time around. But this year, there\u2019s an important new distinction to be aware of regarding the hardware coming to the US versus the rest of the world \u2014 more on that in just a moment.\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Specs\nGoogle\u2019s definitely not going back to the drawing board with the Pixel 10 phones, and at a glance, it can be quite tricky to tell the new family apart from the last generation. But even with that approach to design remaining consistent, the manufacturer hasn\u2019t been afraid to deliver some impactful changes to the hardware you\u2019ll find within.\nWe\u2019ll be covering some of those more important differences in a little more depth, but here\u2019s your bird\u2019s-eye view at how all this hardware compares across the lineup:\n| Pixel 10 | Pixel 10 Pro | Pixel 10

new phone is imaging performance, raw speed, or excellent power management, you should be able to find something about these Pixel 10 phones to make them worthy of consideration. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights.\nCamera\nSome phones really go all-in on camera hardware, and it\u2019s no surprise to see these models with beefy sensors and crazy periscopic zoom options on our list of best camera phones. But even without really jaw-dropping hardware, we also see Google\u2019s Pixel phones join those right up at the top, year after year, thanks in no small part to Google\u2019s exceptional image-processing prowess.\nMaybe the biggest news this year is the arrival of a telephoto option for the base Pixel 10, getting a 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom. Google tries to sell that for a little more than it is, highlighting \u201cup to 10x optical quality\u201d and capable of even tighter zooms with Super Res processing, but we\u2019d be happy either way.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nWith the Pro models, Google doubles down on that sentiment. Here it pairs a 48MP sensor with that 5x optical zoom, and the company claims this offers the highest-quality zoom you\u2019ll get of any smartphone being sold to US shoppers. Similarly, it\u2019s pushing processing to new heights, with these two boasting Pro Res Zoom up to 100x. That\u2019s optimized for the new Tensor G5 processor, and operates using an advanced diffusion model.\nIn addition to the fancy new zoom capabilities, you can expect some solid improvements to optical stabilization quality and auto-focus speed.\nPerformance\nOK, now we\u2019re getting into it. When your smartphone-obsessed friend advised you to hold off buying that Pixel 9 and wait for the Pixel 10 series, this is likely what they looking forward to: the Tensor G5 chip.\nGoogle\u2019s been building Pixel phones around its custom-designed Tensor processors for years now, but with this generation the company moves from Samsung to TSMC as its manufacturing partner \u2014 and as a consequence, jumps from the 4nm process it employed across the past two chips down to 3nm for the G5.\nGoogle's got more to prove than ever this year, with all eyes on the Tensor G5 and its performance.\nUnsurprisingly, this chip is heavily focused on AI capabilities. It can run on-device models with the help of an upgraded TPU, which Google says is 60% more powerful than before. That new production node doesn\u2019t just help the Tensor G5 run on average 34% faster but also aids in keeping power consumption down. And in case you haven\u2019t picked up on it from those incredible camera tricks we were just touching on, this chip\u2019s got an upgraded image processor on board.\nUnlike last year, we\u2019re not getting any big shake-ups when it comes to memory configuration. Google is sticking with the same 12GB for the base Pixel 10 and 16GB on the Pro and Pro XL. We\u2019d love seeing 16GB across the board, but the lack of motion here isn\u2019t exactly surprising.\nYour storage choices also remain largely consistent with the new Pixel 10 generation, still starting down at 128GB, but this time Google drops the 128GB option for the Pixel 10 Pro XL, starting at 256GB, instead \u2014 honestly, a trend we wouldn\u2019t hate to see trickle down to the rest of the phones.\nScreen quality and size\nGoogle\u2019s also sticking with what works when it comes to screen size and resolution, returning with the same 6.3-inch sizes on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, and a 6.8-inch panel on the Pro XL. On the smallest Pixel 10, that spells a pixel density of around 420ppi, while you\u2019ll enjoy a slightly sharper image closer to 490ppi on the Pro models. All three support Smooth Display output at up to 120Hz, but only the Pro models can also dial that down as low as 1Hz for power saving.\nPeak brightness should be about 10% higher this time around, from what Google calls \u201cbest in class\u201d Actua displays \u2014 and better yet, the company claims we\u2019ll get those brighter screens without feeling the impact on battery life. Just like we had with the Pixel 9 series, Google is tapping Corning for some Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nWhile last year brought us a major new look, with that new pill-shaped camera island on the back, the Pixel 10 is very much a smartphone cast in the physical mold of its predecessor. And comparing the sizes of these three phones against their Pixel 9 equivalents, the differences are absolutely minuscule: Really, the only distinction you\u2019ll measure is the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro each coming in a tenth of a millimeter thicker than last year.\nThere is, admittedly, a little heft being added this time around, but it\u2019s on a scale that might be too minor to notice outside of holding one phone in each hand \u2014 maxing out at an 11g difference with the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nJust like on the front, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protects the hardware around back, with a sturdy aluminum frame making up the middle of our smartphone sandwich. And as we\u2019d only expect, all three carry an IP68 ingress rating, so they\u2019ll have no trouble surviving a brief dunk.\nWhat's your favorite Pixel 10 series color?\nThe question of best Pixel colors is a contentious one, granted, and this year you\u2019ve got your choice of four no matter which Pixel you go with. In addition to the expected assortment of neutral tones, we get a few fun options, like Indigo and Lemongrass on the smallest Pixel 10 and Jade available for the Pro and Pro XL.\nDepending on where you get your Pixel 10, you may notice a low-key omission from the phone\u2019s expected design. For Pixel 10 series phones sold in the US, this year, Google is taking the unprecedented step of going eSIM-only: The phones will lack a traditional tray for a physical SIM card. While some users might not blink twice at that, those who rely upon the flexibility of physical SIMs (especially when traveling) could run into trouble \u2014 so be advised.\nBattery life and charging speed\nHere\u2019s one area in particular where we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic this year \u2014 even if that\u2019s one word that\u2019s just positively fraught to throw around when we\u2019re talking all things battery. Instead of making one big change, Google has implemented several, and with any luck, they\u2019ll all add up to make the Pixel 10 series some real endurance champions.\nGoogle started by lowering power demands from phone components, with parts like the 3nm Tensor G5 chip and the updated Actua displays promising to merely sip away at battery capacity. On its own, that might not deliver in the way users hope, but Google pairs that with higher-capacity batteries across the board.\nNow, those gains themselves are a little minor: 270mAh higher on the Pixel 10, 170mAh higher with the 10 Pro, and up 140mAh on the Pro XL. But they are absolutely progressing in the right direction, and we will take all the extra juice phone manufacturers are willing to offer. Maybe most interesting, though, is that this year the little Pixel 10 actually manages to push past the Pro in terms of raw capacity \u2014 even though the phones are the same size, we guess not having a few of those Pro upgrades left room within for some extra battery.\nThat\u2019s consumption and capacity for you, but maybe Google\u2019s biggest win with power on the Pixel 10 series will come from how you recharge them.\nWith this generation, Google is finally giving users a full-featured wireless charging experience, and that means Qi2 support, complete with built-in magnets for secure attachment \u2014 no case required. The company is taking full advantage of this by introducing new Pixelsnap branding for accessories designed to tap into it \u2014 including a long-overdue successor to the Pixel Stand. You\u2019ll enjoy 15W wireless speeds on the Pixel 10 and Pro, while the Pro XL supports even speedier Qi2.2 25W charging.\nWired charging also gets a boost across the lineup, going from 27W to 30W for the Pixel 10 and Pro, while climbing from 37W to 45W on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Google says that users should expect over 30 hours of battery life, and between all these upgrades, that sounds like it just might be within the realm of possibility.\nSoftware and updates\nUnlike last year, when the Pixel 9 phones arrived still running Android 14, Google has sorted out its development cycle, and Android 16 has arrived well in time to show up at home on the Pixel 10 phones. And with seven years of updates in the pipeline, you\u2019ll be running new Android releases well into the next decade.\nJust like everything Google touches these days, the Pixel 10 series is chock full of Gemini AI-powered features \u2014 including a full year of free access to Google AI Pro with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL. Gemini Live is picking up some cool-sounding new tricks, like highlighting stuff in your camera to show you, and the Phone app is adding an impressive real-time translation tool.\nWe finally get to meet what would have been Pixel Sense with the introduction of Magic Cue, an AI-powered assistant with awareness of what you\u2019re working on with your phone, and the ability to offer suggested actions you may want to take next. In case that sounds like a step too far, Google\u2019s privacy controls will let you decide just how much of your data you want AI having access to.\nYou\u2019d have to be living in a cave not to understand how popular journaling is these days. Rather than forcing you to jot your thoughts down in something like Keep, Google\u2019s now offering a dedicated solution in the form of the new Pixel Journal app \u2014 complete with PIN protection to keep your private thoughts private.\nThere\u2019s tons more, too, from Call Message offering a hand dealing with your missed calls to Pixel Studio upgrades, new NotebookLM integration with Pixel Recorder and Screenshots, and Camera Coach helping you get your best shots yet. It\u2019s the new Pixel, after all! This is Google\u2019s biggest chance to show off all year! If you don\u2019t want to miss out on that experience, make sure to get your pre-order in now.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE made a fan out of me \u2014 and I think you should buy it over the Galaxy S24\nApril 30, 2025\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE\nMSRP: $649.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE\nIt\u2019s hard to make a great Android flagship but even harder to make a great mid-range Android phone. With a flagship, you can let your mind run wild, combining a powerful chipset with high-end cameras and setting a price that bumps right up against the $1,000 mark without anyone batting an eye. As soon as you limit yourself to a cost of, say, $600 or $650, you realize just how many sacrifices you have to make. For a while, that\u2019s where Samsung struggled \u2014 its Fan Edition launches always made cuts, but we were never sure if they were the right ones.\nNow, though, Samsung might be turning a corner. It\u2019s packed more power into the Galaxy S24 FE, seemingly with fewer omissions, and it\u2019s put me in a tight spot. As much as I want to continue to beat the drum for the pocket-friendly Galaxy S24 that I carried in early 2024, I\u2019m coming around to the idea that Samsung\u2019s latest upper-mid-ranger might be one of the best values on the market. Here\u2019s why I might stick with it for a bit longer.\nYou know what they say about imitation and flattery\nAt a glance, the Galaxy S24 FE looks almost identical to its namesake sibling. That shouldn\u2019t be a surprise since all of Samsung\u2019s 2024 launches look nearly the same, but the Galaxy S24 FE takes its imitation further than most. It\u2019s almost the same height, width, and thickness as Samsung\u2019s premium Galaxy S24 Plus, relying on a weight difference of about 15 grams to set the two apart. In other words, it\u2019s close enough to fool just about anyone except for the boulder that protects the golden idol at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark.\nAnd you know what? I\u2019m glad that Samsung treated its Galaxy S24 FE more like a flagship this year. In an age when Google is still using plastic for the back of its Pixel 8a (and even the 9a), the Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s mix of an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on both front and back makes it feel premium. And, like the previous Galaxy S23 FE, Samsung\u2019s upper-mid-ranger still has a durable IP68 rating for water and dust. I even like the pale Blue and Mint color options that the phone comes in. Granted, I could do without the glossy, fingerprint-loving finish on the glass, but it\u2019s easy enough to avoid by adding a case.\nThe Galaxy S24 FE feels as sharp as it looks \u2014 literally.\nPerhaps an even better reason to add a case to your Galaxy S24 FE would be to soften the relatively sharp edges of the aluminum frame. Thankfully, the frame has a matte finish that ignores fingerprints, but the design is something like the iPhone 12 or iPhone 13, which isn\u2019t a good thing. If you used either of those phones, you\u2019ll remember that Apple cut a pretty sharp edge where the rear glass met the aluminum frame, which made even its smaller 6.1-inch iPhones uncomfortable to hold after a while. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 FE is the same way \u2014 just much, much bigger. While you could reasonably hold either of those older iPhones by the sides of its frame, the Galaxy S24 FE is a bit too large and hefty. I sometimes find myself either supporting the device on one pinky or using two hands to hold it, neither of which is all that comfortable after a while.\nIf you find a comfortable way to hold the Galaxy S24 FE, it\u2019s an easy phone to enjoy. Samsung\u2019s 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED panel offers plenty of real estate for everything from doom-scrolling to trying to catch \u2019em all in the early stages of Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket, and it packs a 120Hz refresh rate that just about matches that of the flagship Galaxy S24 lineup. There\u2019s a slight difference in brightness \u2014 1,900 nits vs 2,600 nits \u2014 but I haven\u2019t had any trouble opening booster packs in bright sunlight. It\u2019s been a few days since I\u2019ve added anything meaningful to my Pokedex, but I can\u2019t blame Samsung for that.\nIf you want to get nitpicky, you could point out that the Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s bezels are thicker than those of Samsung\u2019s proper flagships. Technically, you\u2019d be right. However, I don\u2019t mind the extra space, as I\u2019m already tired of how easy it is to activate gestures on certain other phones. Take Type to Siri, for example \u2014 I was excited when Apple launched it, as I thought I could keep my dumber questions locked up inside. However, after a few days of using it, I had to turn it off because I was triggering the double-tap activation far too often on Apple\u2019s tiny bezels. The Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s bottom bar might be thick in comparison, but I\u2019ll take that over the constant headache of unwanted gestures.\nUltimately, though, I think the biggest problem with Samsung\u2019s self-imitation is this \u2014 I want a Galaxy device with some personality again. In recent years, Samsung has stripped away the things that made phones such as its Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S22 memorable, ditching the Contour Cut camera bump and rounded frame in favor of something that looked and felt more like an iPhone. If I thought the Galaxy S24 FE was meant to compete with an iPhone, I guess I wouldn\u2019t mind that, but when it\u2019s more interested in the personality-rich Google Pixel, Samsung has some serious catching up to do.\nEven the Exynos 2400e is a pleasant surprise\nWhile I\u2019m not entirely convinced by Samsung copying its own design ad infinitum, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m impressed by what the Galaxy S24 FE does under the hood. Once again, it draws heavily from its flagship family members, but this time, it takes after the international versions of the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus, which came with Exynos 2400 chipsets. Samsung\u2019s affordable flagship starts with the same base RAM and storage as its smallest flagship (8GB and 128GB, respectively), but it\u2019s the in-house Exynos 2400e chipset that bears the closest resemblance.\nIt has almost the same name, so of course, it should perform similarly, right? Well, as we learned with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, sometimes adding a letter makes a big difference. However, in the case of the Exynos 2400 vs Exynos 2400e, the difference is fairly small. The two share the same 10-core structure, but the flagship Exynos 2400 has a slightly higher clock speed on its largest core, topping out at 3.2GHz to the Exynos 2400e\u2019s 3.1GHz. As you might imagine, the small change spells good news for the Galaxy S24 FE in terms of performance. It\u2019s very nearly flagship-grade, just not quite, and nowhere near the gap we feared when we first heard about the FE series\u2019 shift from the Snapdragon-powered S23 FE to an Exynos processor for its latest model.\nI, of course, didn\u2019t expect a perfect flagship performance from a phone that costs $150 less than Samsung\u2019s smallest Galaxy S24, but I wasn\u2019t sure it would come this close, either. No matter which test I picked, from the CPU-heavy Geekbench 6 to the graphically intensive 3DMark Wild Life stress test, the Galaxy S24 FE kept almost perfect pace with its siblings. It beat the Exynos 2400-toting Galaxy S24 that my colleague Rob Triggs used earlier in the year despite having the weaker chipset on paper. If I had to guess, that difference came down to the Galaxy S24 FE having more room for its cooling setup, but it was impressive either way. Check out our Galaxy S24 FE benchmarks deep dive for even more detail on our synthetic performance tests.\nThat performance is just about as consistent in day-to-day life, too, which is the best thing you can say for an upper-mid-range phone. As mentioned, I\u2019ve been playing the life out of Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket, and I\u2019ve yet to notice the Galaxy S24 FE struggling under the weight of my massive Pok\u00e9dex. Granted, the battles in TCG Pocket aren\u2019t the most demanding, but the phone has been smooth as I\u2019ve swiped around, debating which pack of cards to open.\nAnyway, the Galaxy S24 FE was also my backup device for my recent trip abroad to Amsterdam. As such, it was resigned to a support role, offering emergency coverage should the iPhone 16 Pro I was also testing at the time not make it through a long day of usage (which was a genuine fear). I turned out not to need Samsung\u2019s affordable flagship while there, but it did give me a chance to watch for idle battery drain any time I pulled the phone out of my backpack. There was some drain \u2014 no doubt \u2014 but not as much as I might have expected for a US-based device with a Samsung-provided Verizon SIM that I forgot to turn off.\nThankfully, when I could give it a proper test run, the rest of the Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s battery performance turned out to be pretty good, too \u2014 or at least good enough. The S24 FE landed perfectly in the middle of the road when put up against Samsung\u2019s other devices from the year, including both versions of the Galaxy S24 and the Snapdragon-equipped Galaxy S24 Plus. It handled a simulated Zoom meeting better than both Galaxy S24 models and only came up shy of the power-sipping Galaxy A35 5G when snapping photos. Admittedly, I might have expected more out of the 4,700mAh battery \u2014 especially compared to just 4,000mAh on the Galaxy S24 \u2014 but I still made it comfortably from one day to the next before needing a charger.\nAs if to crib one more feature from its premium family members, the Galaxy S24 FE offers the same charging setup as Samsung\u2019s top-end devices. It supports 25W wired charging with a compatible USB-PD PPS charger, or you can use 15W wireless charging from a Qi-certified pad. From my testing, it looks like the Galaxy S24 FE maintains that top 25W speed better than Samsung\u2019s flagships, too, as the phone reached a full charge in the same 75 minutes that it took the Exynos-equipped Galaxy S24 \u2014 not bad when you\u2019re saving $150.\nThese are Samsung cameras, through and through\nWhen Samsung is piping this many of its own features from the flagship market to its other offerings, it\u2019s enough to make you nervous. So far, I haven\u2019t really hit on any significant cost-saving omissions from the Galaxy S24 FE, and we\u2019re running out of things to talk about. By process of elimination, that might make you think the Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s cameras stink. Well, the good news is they don\u2019t \u2014 at least not if you like how Samsung typically handles its image processing or expect performance on the level of the very best camera phones out there.\nFor starters, the three cameras on the Galaxy S24 FE look exactly like those on the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S24 Plus \u2014 stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before. The standard, ultrawide, and telephoto sensors sit in their own aluminum-guarded ring, accompanied only by a flash that sits off to the side. Of the three, the 50MP primary camera is the closest to what you\u2019d find on one of Samsung\u2019s flagships, shrinking by just a fraction of an inch. From there, the peripheral cameras start to tail off a little bit, with the 3x optical telephoto sensor dropping to 8MP from 10MP and the ultrawide sensor shrinking from 1/2.55 inches to 1/3.0 inches, resulting in smaller individual megapixels that can\u2019t capture quite as much light.\nBut before you start to spell doom and gloom about some downgrades, it\u2019s time to mention Samsung\u2019s not-so-secret weapon: Galaxy AI. I\u2019ve largely avoided talking about Samsung\u2019s AI rollout so far, but the addition of the ProVisual Engine gives the Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s cameras a boost that generally overcomes the shrinking sensors. Samsung\u2019s upgraded engine somewhat acts like the image processing wing of Google\u2019s Tensor chip, breaking down and enhancing your images while maintaining as much accuracy as possible. It\u2019s not always perfect, but I appreciate the jump from when you press the shutter to when you get your final result. Anyway, let\u2019s get to some sample shots.\nRight off the bat, you can tell these shots came from a Samsung phone. Although Samsung\u2019s overall color science has shifted to become a bit more natural over the last few cycles, it\u2019s not all the way there yet, most noticeably with the reds and greens. And, because it\u2019s fall here in Maryland, all I\u2019ve got are reds and greens. That means that bright colors like the neon green of the blow-up spider are even brighter than reality, and the vibrant leaves still clinging to the tree look almost like they\u2019re on fire. However, there are a few spots where the color science doesn\u2019t work for Samsung, like the shot of the wetland in the first row, where all the colors seem to bleed together.\nOn the bright side, the Galaxy S24 FE seems to nail details across the board. Sure, there\u2019s a bit of distortion around the edges of the tree to the left, but the edge detection around the skeletal flamingo is spot-on, and you can easily make out every wrinkle and ridge on the Boygenius sculpture to the right.\nMoving on to zoom capabilities, I\u2019ve probably never been so happy to have an 8MP telephoto sensor. It\u2019s not perfect, sitting as the smallest sensor of Samsung\u2019s trio, but it shows its worth when you compare the Galaxy S24 FE to other upper-mid-range options like the Motorola Edge (2024) or Pixel 8a. The telephoto sensor adds a little more flexibility with its 3x optical focal length, allowing me to punch in on the flag over Fort McHenry and capture solid detail. Results are still decent at 10x zoom, though the field of blue stars is a little harder to make out as I was shooting towards the sun. Also, while I\u2019m impressed by the creases that the Galaxy S24 FE captured in the flag at 20x zoom, the image suffers some ghosting around the flagpole itself.\nAlthough I can live with the fact that even affordable flagships probably won\u2019t take great 30x zoom photos for a while, I have a more important bone to pick with Samsung \u2014 it simply can\u2019t handle motion in photos. I was trying to capture a few new profile photos for the shelter dog above, but I could never catch her entirely in focus. If her head came out sharp, her paw was blurry. If I got her body in focus, her face blurred. You can also see the blurring on my friend\u2019s hand where she\u2019s scratching the dog. As someone who typically shoots with automatic settings, I\u2019d love for Samsung to bump up its default shutter speed.\nAlso, if you\u2019re after an upper-mid-range phone with impressive video specs, the Galaxy S24 FE might fit the bill. It supports 4K resolution at 30 and 60fps and 8K video at 30fps. You\u2019ll probably burn through your 128GB of base storage if you shoot much in 8K, and you won\u2019t be able to view the clips in full resolution on the Full HD Plus display, but the stabilization is impressive \u2014 even if you can only zoom up to 5x in the highest resolution.\nSomehow, I\u2019m glad Galaxy AI is here\nNow that I\u2019ve opened the Galaxy AI door, let\u2019s stay awhile. After all, the Galaxy S24 FE is the first non-flagship Samsung phone to come with this many AI-powered features right out of the box. And, if nothing else, that makes it the most interesting sub-flagship launch from Samsung since it revived the Fan Edition lineup in 2020. Granted, it\u2019s competing with a Galaxy S21 FE that launched a few months too late and a Galaxy S23 FE that only offered Circle to Search, so that might not be a high bar.\nEither way, I\u2019m more receptive to the Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s flavor of on-device AI than I might have expected. It doesn\u2019t punch you in the face with features like Browsing Assist or Interpreter mode with a pushy tips app, instead letting you stumble upon them when they might fit your needs. As such, I\u2019ve avoided the tools I don\u2019t need (like Live Translate and Portrait Studio) while using the ones I like, like Instant Slow-Mo when I took a shelter dog for an afternoon walk.\nI still don't love Sketch to Image, but Samsung's Energy Score is the best use for Galaxy AI so far.\nI\u2019ve also avoided the more generative Galaxy AI features \u2014 the ones that I\u2019m still convinced need the most work. See the shot of the painted pumpkin above? Cute, right? Well, it\u2019s not wearing a hat in the original image. I used Sketch to Image to draw a pointy witch hat on top of its orange head, only for Samsung to generate a cowboy hat instead. It\u2019s still Halloween-appropriate, but not what I expected as a result. Maybe I can blame my fingers for not drawing very well, but I\u2019d say a witch hat and a cowboy hat look different enough for Samsung to know the difference.\nAnyway, some of Samsung\u2019s other Galaxy AI features more than make up for what I dislike about its generative abilities. Specifically, I\u2019m thinking of how the Galaxy S24 FE interacts with the health-tracking features of the Galaxy Watch 7. While reviewing Samsung\u2019s latest smartwatch, I found myself appreciating metrics like the Energy Score, which took into account my level of activity and how well I\u2019d slept the previous night to forecast how I\u2019d feel each day. It was an easier-to-understand version of Garmin\u2019s Body Battery, and I generally agreed with its assessments. It might not have been perfect, but at least it felt like a practical use of AI.\nBetter yet, I won\u2019t be surprised if the Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s Galaxy AI experience continues to grow and change as Samsung rolls out new features to its flagship lineup. After all, the Exynos 2400e chipset should be just as capable as the full-strength Exynos 2400 when it comes to handling on-device requests, and Samsung\u2019s seven years of software updates shouldn\u2019t hurt either. It\u2019s yet another upgrade over the four years that the previous Galaxy S23 FE offered, and just enough to keep the Galaxy S24 FE in line with the latest from Google and Apple, too.\nJust keep in mind that some of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy AI features are restricted to its in-house apps. Browsing Assist, for example, can generate a summary of an entire website in a few seconds, but it only works on the Samsung Internet browser, even though Chrome is the default browser on the Galaxy S24 FE. Some of those health tracking features will disappear if you switch away from a Samsung phone or wearable, too, so you have to be ready to spend some time in the Galaxy to make it worth your while.\nAlso, although Samsung has begun its One UI 7 rollout, I wouldn\u2019t recommend downloading it just yet. Samsung didn\u2019t exactly rush into its update, and when it did come out, it came with quite a few bugs and caused battery life issues on both Galaxy phones and wearables.\nSo, is the Samsung Galaxy S24 worth it, and who is it really for?\nWe questioned in our initial hands-on (video at the top of this review) if the Galaxy S24 FE was truly a phone for the fans based on some of Samsung\u2019s choices; it turns out the definitive answer was a resounding yes.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE looks like a flagship, benchmarks almost like a flagship, charges like a flagship, and is $150 cheaper than the most affordable Galaxy S24. So, who could ever possibly reach for Samsung\u2019s flagship over its affordable flagship that offers almost the same value on all fronts? Well, I would \u2014 but I don\u2019t think most people should. I wouldn\u2019t expect most people to benefit massively from the small camera changes, overall material upgrades, or the slightly faster updates that Samsung\u2019s flagships get \u2014 the S24 FE does enough to hold its ground for most would-be buyers.\nThe only reason I\u2019d personally choose the base Galaxy S24 ($859.99 at Amazon) or its newer replacement, the Galaxy S25 ($809.99 at Amazon) over the Galaxy S24 FE is that I really like small phones. It\u2019s well-documented that I\u2019m not a large guy, which makes wrangling a 6.7-inch device (or larger) a headache I don\u2019t want to deal with. Add a case that makes the sharp aluminum frame even larger, and I may as well carry an iPad Mini around for my day-to-day tasks.\nThe Galaxy S24 FE is so good that fans and newcomers to the Galaxy family will all find something to love about it.\nBut, if you\u2019re not like me, I would tell you to grab the Galaxy S24 FE over almost any other phone in Samsung\u2019s lineup if you are cost-conscious but still want a great experience. It\u2019s far more capable than the cheaper Galaxy A36 5G ($399.99 at Amazon), sporting better build quality, longer update support, and sharper, more flexible cameras. The Galaxy S24 FE makes more sense for most people than the Galaxy S25 Plus ($999.99 at Amazon), too, but for different reasons. It doesn\u2019t beat Samsung\u2019s $1,000 flagship in any one of the categories above, but it\u2019s much closer than the $350 price difference would suggest. Even if you prefer the finer boxes that the Galaxy S25 Plus checks, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll find a deal that makes the price truly competitive, especially if carriers offer the Galaxy S24 FE for free or when the latter\u2019s price also starts to drop in sales. In fact, it\u2019s on sale at the time of this writing for ~$550, which is an incredible value.\nThere is, however, one deal in town that might make the Galaxy S24 FE sweat \u2014 Google\u2019s Pixel 9a ($499 at Amazon). It\u2019s after essentially the same group of Android fans that Samsung\u2019s Fan Edition hopes to court, but Google can offer its services at a slightly cheaper price point thanks to a deeper set of cuts. You have to live with two cameras rather than three, a smaller display, a plastic back panel, and slower charging, but on the flip side, you\u2019ll get Google\u2019s light, smooth Pixel UI, an ever-growing list of Gemini AI features, and the image processing we\u2019ve praised ever since the earliest days of the Pixel \u2014 all while saving $150 over the Galaxy S24 FE. The only question is which you\u2019d rather keep in your pocket for the next seven years, as both are supported for Android updates for the same amount of time.\nIf I were picking between those two, I think the choice would be as simple as whether I preferred Pixel UI or One UI.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nAndroid 16: Confirmed features, codename, leaks, release date, and everything else we know so far\nAugust 26, 2025\nGoogle switched things up with Android 15 when it decided to decouple the platform update from the Pixel 9 series. That decision gave both the software and hardware their own breathing room and independent timelines. Android 16 has been out in the stable branch for Pixel devices for some time now, and OEMs like Samsung have also released their stable platform update. Google has also released Android 16 QPR2 betas for Pixel devices, but features within will come to the broader Android platform only with Android 17, so stay tuned for that. Here\u2019s what we know about Android 16, its confirmed features, and leaked features that didn\u2019t make the cut to the stable release.\nMain index to primary sections:\nAndroid 16: Name\nGoogle used to name Android versions with dessert codenames, but it strayed away from that tradition with the release of Android 10, choosing to stick with only the version number for all future releases. Consequently, Android 16 will be known simply as \u201cAndroid 16,\u201d with no dessert codename officially used.\nHowever, Google still uses the dessert codename internally. Android 16\u2019s internal codename leaked recently as Baklava. This is interesting because Android 15\u2019s codename was Vanilla Ice Cream, so you\u2019d think Android 16 would be known as something that starts with a \u201cW\u201d (\u201cWaffle\u201d would have been a good one). So why did Google jump from \u201cV\u201d all the way back to \u201cB?\u201d It\u2019s a bit complicated, but it mainly involves big changes to Android\u2019s backend.\nAndroid 16: Release date and timeline\nGoogle had previously only mentioned that Android 16 is coming earlier than usual, corroborating our release date leak.\nWhen Android 16\u2019s release timeline was officially announced, Google only gave vague windows for release. Still, aligning with this schedule, Android 16 reached the Platform Stability milestone with its Beta 3 release in March 2025, while the Beta 4 release in April 2025 is its second Platform Stability release. Finally, Android 16 was released in its stable form on June 10, 2025, marking the culmination of this release cycle.\nThis preponed timeline is a stark departure from Android\u2019s history, as Google usually releases major versions of Android in Q3 or Q4 of each year. But nothing was forcing Google to follow this timeline \u2014 the company was merely following a release cadence it had settled into over a decade.\nMoving the major release forward to Q2 lets Google \u201cbetter align with the schedule of device launches across [its] ecosystem, so more devices can get the major release of Android sooner.\u201d This will hopefully mean the Google Pixel 10 series will launch with Android 16 instead of Android 15, for example. For more information, you can check out our articles to learn more about how Google was able to move Android 16\u2019s release date and how Android\u2019s faster release schedule will affect apps.\nFurther, Google has also mentioned its intentions of releasing more minor updates to the Android OS. For this, Google has planned a minor release in Q4 2024, i.e., for Android 16, presumably taking the shape of Android 16 QPR2. This might be marketed as Android 16.1, but we\u2019re unsure about the name.\nIf you own an Android 16-supported Pixel device, you will get an OTA update to Android 16, but you can always sideload and install the update on your own, too.\nBeyond Pixels, Samsung has released Android 16-based stable One UI 8 on its new foldables, namely the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. Other devices in the company\u2019s lineup are expected to get stable Android 16 very soon. Other OEMs have also been running Android 16-based developer betas for some of their phones.\nGoogle is also shifting Android OS development to its internal branch in an effort to streamline its development process. This move has little effect on end users or app developers, but you can learn more about its effects on platform developers.\nAndroid 16: Easter Egg\nAn Easter Egg is a message or feature playfully hidden from users. As a tradition, Google has been sneaking in fun Easter eggs into Android, ranging from minigames to tools highlighting some capability of that year\u2019s Android release.\nAndroid 16\u2019s Easter Egg is largely similar to Android 14 and Android 15\u2019s Easter Eggs, all of which are a spaceship minigame that explores the vastness of space. You can find it in Settings > About phone, and repeatedly tap on the Android version until you see the Android 16 logo floating in space. Press and hold on this Android 16 logo to launch the spaceship minigame.\nGoogle has added some new functionality to Android 16\u2019s Easter Egg. With Android 16 Beta 3, we spotted two changes, which are live with Android 16\u2019s stable release. It is now possible to manually engage the autopilot system in the game when you are playing it yourself, with the new \u201cAUTO\u201d button in the bottom right-hand corner. Previously, this only engaged when you set the game as your screensaver.\nWith the autopilot engaged, the Easter Egg now displays a progress-centric notification, a key part of the new Live Updates feature in Android 16.\nLive Updates isn\u2019t fully enabled in Android 16\u2019s stable release, so you will only see the new progress-centric notification in the stable release. Other changes, like the status bar chip, prominent display on the notification panel and lock screen, and always-on display, are not present in the stable release.\nAndroid 16: Confirmed features and changes\nHere are the features that Google has announced or confirmed are coming with the official Android 16 platform update:\n- Live Updates\n- Force group notifications\n- Notification cooldown\n- Power button shortcut for wallet\n- HDR screenshots\n- New emojis from Unicode 16.0\n- Embedded photo picker\n- Health records\n- Better Adaptive Refresh Rate (ARR) support\n- Better app adaptability\n- APV codec support\n- Predictive back upgrades\n- Ranging with enhanced security\n- Privacy Sandbox on Android\n- WritingTools API to let apps block AI writing tools\n- Generic ranging APIs\n- Night Mode Camera extension API\n- Vertical Text support\n- App Functions API: Gemini Extensions\n- Measurement system customization\n- Camera updates: Hybrid auto-exposure, precise color temperature and tint adjustments\n- Media update: Motion photo capture, Ultra HDR image enhancements\n- Mandating edge-to-edge apps\n- Advanced Protection Mode\n- Automatically hiding sensitive notifications from lock screen\n- Anti-scammer safeguards during phone calls\n- Ambient volume controls for Bluetooth LE Audio hearing aids\n- Auracast Broadcast audio support\n- Secure Lock\n- Network notification\n- Trade-in mode\n- Outline text for maximum text contrast\n- Vulkan, the official graphics API for Android\n- iOS-like App Settings with SettingsPreferenceService API\n- In-process software audio codecs\n- Cloud compilation for app installs\n- Identity check coming to more phones and apps\n- Customizable keyboard shortcuts\n- Pixel: Battery Health page\n- Standardized picture and audio quality framework for TVs\nLive updates\nWith Android 16, Google is introducing Live Updates, a new class of notifications that helps users monitor and access important ongoing activities. They help prevent these critical progress-tracking use cases from being lost among other less-timely notifications, give them a prominent home on the lock screen, and provide a more consistent user experience.\nLive Updates will look and feel similar to iOS\u2019 Live Activities feature. One point of difference is that Google suggests Live Updates for ride-sharing, food delivery, and navigation use cases since these Live Updates\u2019 notifications are treated with high priority.\nDespite the hype around Live Updates, note that the first stable release of Android 16 only brings the new \u201cprogress-centric\u201d notification style. This new notification style shows the progress of something like a rideshare pickup, a food delivery dropoff, or the distance until the next turn.\nAs the notification\u2019s name implies, progress-centric notifications show more information in the notification, alongside a progress tracker. This will let you get most of what you need without re-opening the parent app.\nThere is more to Live Updates, but these changes aren\u2019t present in Android 16\u2019s first stable release. Instead, they are destined to come later, possibly with Android 16 QPR releases or even with Android 17. These changes include the Live Update chip in the status bar, letting you view certain critical information without pulling down the notification.\nWith later Android releases, Live Updates will also give such high-priority notifications a consistent look and experience across the lock screen and even the Always On Display. This way, you always have all that you need to know right at your fingertips, without needing to dig through apps and other notification clutter.\nLive Updates are currently restricted to delivery, rideshare, and navigation apps. We\u2019ve already shown you Live Updates in Google Maps, and later this year, you can expect to see them from other top players in these categories too.\nLive Updates are important as these progress-centric notifications will be displayed more prominently on the lock screen. Google is working on a new compact notification shelf on the lock screen for Android 16, and when that is enabled, notifications are collapsed into a shelf that you have to tap to expand. Progress-centric notifications, i.e., Live Updates, likely won\u2019t be collapsed into this shelf along with other notifications. But as mentioned, we\u2019ll have to wait for future Android releases to get the full Live Updates experience.\nForce group notifications\nAndroid 16 automatically groups notifications from the same app. This means that all alerts from a single app will be bundled together, which you can then expand or collapse with a simple tap.\nBefore Android 16, notification grouping was optional for app developers, but the new update removes the choice to offer users a more organized notification experience.\nNotification cooldown\nGoogle added the Notification Cooldown feature to Pixels with the March 2025 Pixel Feature Drop, but it\u2019s also coming to the wider Android platform with the stable Android 16 release.\nWhen you get a burst of notifications from the same app, Android 16 will gradually lower the alert volume for up to a minute instead of repeatedly playing it at full blast. This \u201cNotification Cooldown\u201d feature is on by default and can be toggled in Settings > Notifications.\nPower button shortcut for wallet apps\nWith Android 16, you can now set a double-press of the power button to open Google Wallet instead of the camera. You can choose between these two options in Settings > System > Gestures.\nHDR screenshots\nWith Android 16 Beta 2, Google implemented support for true HDR screenshots. Screenshots of HDR content will be saved in HDR format, namely as PNG files with HDR gainmaps embedded in them. Viewing these screenshots will brighten the screen to allow the HDR highlights to pop. These gainmaps allow the screenshots to appear as HDR when viewed on Android 16 devices but as SDR on other devices.\nNew emojis from Unicode 16.0\nAndroid 16 includes an updated emoji font file with seven new emojis that are a part of Unicode 16.0:\n- Face with Bags Under Eyes\n- Fingerprint\n- Leafless Tree\n- Root Vegetable\n- Harp\n- Shovel\n- Splatter\nEmbedded photo picker\nWith Android 16 Developer Preview 1, Google added new APIs related to the photo picker. These new APIs allow app developers to have more creative control over how the photo picker appears for the user. This makes it feel like the photo picker is more a part of that app while still keeping the same security and privacy safeguards.\nWith Android 16 Developer Preview 2, Google added new APIs to enable searching from cloud media providers in the Android photo picker. Search functionality in the photo picker is then said to be \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nFor reference, the photo picker is the pop-up menu you see when uploading media to an app. Years ago, adding media to an app would require that app to gain access to your entire media library, which is obviously not great. The photo picker allows you to select just the photos and videos you want to upload, preventing the app from \u201cseeing\u201d anything except what you give it.\nHealth records\nWith Android 16 Developer Preview 1, Google updated Health Connect to support certain health records. This allows Health Connect to both read and write Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, likely the same standard your doctor, dentist, and other healthcare providers use.\nDue to the sensitive nature of this feature, though, Google is limiting it within an early access program, forcing developers to apply for access before playing around with it.\nWith Android 16 Developer Preview 2, Google added a new ACTIVITY_INTENSITY datatype, which is defined according to WHO guidelines for moderate and vigorous activity. Each record requires the start time, the end time, and whether the activity intensity is moderate or vigorous.\nGoogle didn\u2019t mention this, but we spotted that Android 16 DP1 also adds new APIs to let apps read and write mindfulness sessions. We\u2019ve also spotted Fitbit working to add support for Health records.\nBetter Adaptive Refresh Rate (ARR) support\nAdaptive Refresh Rate (ARR) was introduced in Android 15, and it went live for the Pixel 9 series with the Android 15 QPR1 release. It enables the display refresh rate on supported hardware to adapt to the content frame rate using discrete VSync steps. This reduces power consumption while eliminating the need for potentially jank-inducing mode switching.\nWith Android 16 Developer Preview 2, Google added new APIs to make it easier for app developers to take advantage of ARR, so you can expect better support for the feature in future app releases.\nBetter app adaptability\nAndroid 16 is phasing out the ability for apps to restrict screen orientation and resizability on large-screen devices like tablets, foldables, and beyond. Google notes that this feature is similar to features that OEMs have added on such devices, allowing users to run apps at any window size and aspect ratio. With Android 16, APIs and manifest attributes that restrict orientation and resizing will be ignored for apps (but not games) on large-screen devices.\nAndroid 16 allows app developers to opt out of this change, but the Android release in 2026 (i.e., Android 17) will make this change mandatory. So, app developers should start working on making their apps adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios.\nAPV codec support\nAndroid 16 Beta 1 added support for the APV 422-10 Profile, which provides YUV422 color sampling, 10-bit encoding, and target bitrates of up to 2Gbps.\nAdvanced Professional Video (APV) codec is a new \u201cprofessional\u201d video codec that aims to provide \u201cperceptually lossless video quality\u201d while using 20% less storage than the existing \u201cconventional professional video codec\u201d formats.\nGoogle mentions that the APV codec has the following features:\n- Perceptually lossless video quality (close to raw video quality)\n- Low complexity and high throughput intra-frame-only coding (without pixel domain prediction) to better support editing workflows\n- Support for high bitrate range up to a few Gbps for 2K, 4K, and 8K resolution content, enabled by a lightweight entropy coding scheme\n- Frame tiling for immersive content and for enabling parallel encoding and decoding\n- Support for various chroma sampling formats and bit-depths\n- Support for multiple decoding and re-encoding without severe visual quality degradation\n- Support multi-view video and auxiliary video like depth, alpha, and preview\n- Support for HDR10/10+ and user-defined metadata\nRanging with enhanced security\nWith Android 16, Google is adding support for robust security features in Wi-Fi location on supported devices with Wi-Fi 6\u2019s 802.11az. Thanks to this, apps can now combine the protocol\u2019s higher accuracy, greater scalability, and dynamic scheduling with security enhancements, including AES-256-based encryption and protection against MITM attacks. This allows it to be used more safely in proximity use cases, such as unlocking a laptop or a vehicle door.\nPredictive back upgrades\nAndroid 16 Developer Preview 2 added new APIs to help app developers enable predictive back system animations in gesture navigation, such as the back-to-home animation.\nEarlier in the year, we spotted Google working on bringing predictive back support to three-button navigation in Android 16. With Android 16 Beta 1, Google indeed did so for apps that have correctly implemented predictive back. With three-button navigation, long-pressing the back button will initiate a predictive back animation, giving users a preview of where the back button takes them. This behavior applies across all areas of the system that support predictive back animations, including the system animations.\nPrivacy Sandbox on Android\nAndroid 16 Developer Preview 1 incorporated the latest version of the Privacy Sandbox on Android.\nWritingTools API to let apps block AI writing tools\nAndroid 16 Developer Preview 2\u2019s documentation includes a new Writing Tools API that seemingly lets apps out of having AI rewrite text for you. The documentation notes that \u201ctoolkits can optionally disable [AI writing tools] where not relevant, e.g., passwords, number input, etc.\u201d\nThe logic behind this new Writing Tools API would be to allow app developers to disable AI writing tools where it doesn\u2019t make sense to have them. It will be up to the keyboard app to respect the new API. Even if both the apps play nice with each other, a user could always just generate text in another app and then insert it into the text field where it was supposed to be blocked.\nGeneric ranging APIs\nAndroid 16 Beta 1 included the new RangingManager, which provides ways to determine the distance and angle of supported hardware between the local device and a remote device. RangingManager supports a variety of ranging technologies, such as BLE channel sounding, BLE RSSI-based ranging, Ultra-Wideband, and Wi-Fi round-trip time.\nThis should theoretically lead to better device tracker support in the OS, as your Android device will soon be able to pinpoint the tracker\u2019s distance and angle.\nNight Mode Camera extension API\nGoogle introduced a new Night Mode Indicator API with Android 16 Beta 1. This API helps apps automatically adjust to low-light environments when capturing images or recording videos.\nVertical Text support\nAndroid 16 Beta 1 added low-level support for rendering and measuring text vertically to provide foundational vertical writing support for library developers. This is particularly useful for languages like Japanese, which commonly use vertical writing systems.\nApp Functions API: Gemini Extensions\nThis is curiously mentioned in the release announcement for Android 16 Beta 1, but it was not a part of Android 16 Beta 1 right away. Google highlighted that Samsung launched new Gemini Extensions on the Galaxy S25 series, showing off the new ways that Android apps can integrate with the power of Gemini. These Gemini extensions are pretty much the \u201capp functions\u201d feature that we spotted long before the official announcement.\nGoogle says it is working to make this functionality available to more apps with more OEMs on more devices across more form factors. However, the company stops short of providing more details, technical or otherwise, in the first announcement.\nWith Android 16, Google is introducing a new App Functions API that lets developers expose their app\u2019s key features to the phone\u2019s default assistant, which can then execute those functions on the user\u2019s behalf. For example, a restaurant app could use the API to create a function for ordering food, allowing Gemini to place an order directly with that app.\nHowever, this API isn\u2019t exclusive to Android 16. Google has created a backward-compatible version to encourage developers to integrate their apps with Gemini. Even more curiously, Google hasn\u2019t publicized this feature, presumably because it still needs some work despite being available.\nMeasurement system customization\nWe predicted that Android 16 would let you set your preferred measurement system and region independent of the system language. With Android 16 Beta 2, Google announced that you can set your preferred measurement system in System > Languages & region. We didn\u2019t hear more on the regional preferences feature, though.\nCamera updates: Hybrid auto-exposure, precise color temperature and tint adjustments\nWith Android 16 Beta 2, Google added new hybrid auto-exposure modes to the Camera2 API. This allows third-party apps to manually control specific aspects of exposure while letting the auto-exposure (AE) algorithm handle the rest. With that, apps can allow users to control ISO and AE or exposure time and AE, providing greater flexibility compared to the current approach, where you either have full manual control or rely entirely on auto-exposure.\nAndroid 16 Beta 2 also added camera support for fine color temperature and tint adjustments to better support professional video recording apps.\nMedia update: Motion photo capture, Ultra HDR image enhancements\nAndroid 16 Beta 2 also added a standard Intent action for capturing and displaying Motion Photos.\nIt also added support for Ultra HDR images in the HEIC file format, in addition to the existing JPEG format. Google says it is also working on AVIF support for Ultra HDR.\nAndroid 16 Beta 2 also added additional parameters to Ultra HDR, including the ability to get and set the colorspace in which gain map math should be applied and support for HDR-encoded base images with SDR gain maps.\nMandating edge-to-edge apps\nWith Android 15, Google revealed that apps would display content edge-to-edge by default. However, to help developers with the transition, Google added an API to allow apps to opt out of this change.\nWith Android 16 Beta 2, this transitionary API has been deprecated. Apps that target the latest Android version will have to display app content edge-to-edge, and there\u2019s no longer any means for apps to opt out.\nAdvanced Protection Mode\nGoogle already has an Advanced Protection Program, which, when enrolled in, forces users to use a security key or passkey to sign into their Google account, prevents downloading files that Google Chrome marks as harmful, and blocks unapproved (by Google) apps from accessing their Google account data. On your Android device, Google Play Protect will stay enabled, will block you from installing apps from outside the Google Play Store or other preinstalled apps, and will even warn you about apps on the Play Store that haven\u2019t been approved by Google. The program targets users at an elevated risk of getting hacked, like IT admins, journalists, activists, business executives, and politicians.\nWith Android 16, Google is integrating the Advanced Protection Program into Android with the new Advanced Protection Mode. The mode is a one-click solution that can bolster the security of phones running Android 16. When enabled, it toggles various security features within the OS and first-party Google apps to protect against threats from malicious third-party apps, external attackers, and harmful websites.\nThere\u2019s also an Advanced Protection API, which allows third-party apps to check if the mode is active and enable their own security measures, further enhancing your security when using them.\nYou must have an Android phone or tablet running Android 16 to enable Advanced Protection. Then, open the Settings app, find Google settings, and look for the Advanced Protection page under the Personal & device safety category, as shown below. Finally, toggle \u201cdevice protection\u201d to enable the Advanced Protection mode on your Android device. You can also tap \u201caccount protection\u201d to open the enrollment page for Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program, which you should enroll in if you want to safeguard your Google account.\nHere is a list of every security feature that Advanced Protection enables in Android 16:\n- Security Investigation:\n- Device Safety:\n- Theft Detection Lock\n- Offline Device Lock\n- Inactivity Reboot\n- USB Protection (which could affect fast charging)\n- Apps:\n- Google Play Protect\n- Unknown Apps\n- Memory Tagging Extension (MTE)\n- Networks:\n- 2G Network Protection\n- Disable Auto-Reconnect to Insecure Networks\n- Web:\n- Android Safe Browsing\n- Chrome Browsing\n- Javascript Protections\n- Phone by Google:\n- Caller ID & Spam\n- Automatic Call Screen\n- Scam Detection for Phone by Google\n- Google Messages:\n- Spam & Scam Protection\n- Unsafe Links\nYou can read more about these in our Android Advanced Protection deep dive article.\nAutomatically hiding sensitive notifications from lock screen\nAndroid 15 added a feature where the OS blocks untrusted apps from reading sensitive notifications with two-factor authentication codes, even if the app has permission to read all notifications. Android 16 extends this feature by redacting the notifications before displaying them on the lock screen. This redaction will only occur in \u201chigher risk scenarios,\u201d such as when a user\u2019s device is not connected to Wi-Fi and has not been recently unlocked.\nAndroid 16 DP1 no longer displays the contents of notifications that Android System Intelligence deems to be \u201csensitive.\u201d So far, we\u2019ve observed this to be the case for notifications with OTP codes in them, but it\u2019s possible that other types of content might trigger this behavior.\nAndroid 16 automatically hides the content of these sensitive notifications even if you enable the \u201csensitive notifications\u201d option under Settings > Notifications > Sensitive notifications. That option, when disabled, hides the title and summary of all notifications on the lock screen, though you can still see what apps have posted notifications. A separate option on the same page named notifications on lock screen lets you control whether to hide all notifications entirely, only hide conversation notifications, or to show all notification content.\nBy automatically redacting sensitive notifications with OTP codes, Android 16 protects you from accidentally leaking that information, regardless of your lock screen notification choices.\nAnti-scammer safeguards during phone calls\nWith Android 16, Google has introduced new anti-scammer safeguards, especially during phone calls. Android 16 will detect when a phone call is active and prevent the user from enabling the sideloading permission. This would prevent scammers from trying to walk their victims through sideloading malware apps.\nAndroid 16 also blocks the enabling of certain sensitive permissions, such as accessibility access, during active phone calls. Granting accessibility access allows an app to read the screen and perform actions on your behalf \u2014 a powerful combination that could give malicious software complete control of your device.\nAmbient volume controls for Bluetooth LE Audio hearing aids\nAndroid 16 has added the ability for users of Bluetooth LE Audio hearing aids to adjust the volume of ambient sound that is picked up by the hearing aid\u2019s microphones. This will be helpful in places where background noise is either too loud or too quiet.\nAndroid 16 also added the ability for users of LE Audio hearing aids to \u201cswitch between the built-in microphones on the hearing aids and the microphone on their phone for voice calls.\u201d Google says this can be helpful in noisy environments or in other situations where the hearing aid\u2019s microphone may not perform well.\nAuracast Broadcast audio support\nWith Android 16 Beta 3, Google officially supports Auracast broadcast audio with compatible LE Audio hearing aids on Pixel 9 devices. Auracast enables compatible hearing aids and earbuds to receive direct audio streams from public venues like airports, concerts, and classrooms. The setting is hidden, but you can enable it with a Developer Options toggle.\nWith this, Google is also indirectly confirming that the Bluetooth Audio Sharing feature that went live in Android 16 DP1 will be part of the upcoming Android 16 release. You can find the audio sharing feature under Settings > Connected devices > Audio sharing.\nSecure Lock\nSecure Lock is a new Android 16 feature that allows users to remotely lock down their phone via authorized clients into an enhanced security state, which restricts access to sensitive data (app notifications, widgets, quick settings, assistant, etc) and requires both credential and biometric authentication for device entry. In other words, unlocking a device remotely triggered with Secure Lock will require both your primary lock screen credential and biometrics.\nWhen enabling or disabling Secure Lock on a device, a custom message can be shown on the lock screen. If no message is provided, the system will show a default message, such as \u201cDevice is securely locked remotely\u201d if Secure Lock has been enabled or \u201cSecure lock mode has been disabled\u201d if it\u2019s been disabled.\nNetwork notification\nUpcoming devices that launch with Android 16 will support v3.0 of Android\u2019s IRadio HAL, which is needed to trigger the new \u201cMobile network security\u201d settings page in Settings > Security & privacy > Safety Center.\nThis section contains a toggle for the new Network Notifications, which allows the system to warn you if your device connects to an unencrypted network or when the network requests your phone\u2019s unique identifiers.\nCurrent devices that will be updated to Android 16 are unlikely to get the feature. We will most likely have to wait for upcoming devices that launch with Android 16 to see this feature in action.\nTrade-in mode for ADB\nTrade-ins can take a lot of time, partially because every phone traded in must be inspected. Non-functional devices are easy to inspect since they either have cracks that disqualify them or do not boot up, but functional devices need to be booted up and run through a series of tests to confirm that they are functioning properly. For the tests to run, the device must go through the setup screen like a brand-new phone and then enable ADB debugging, which is buried deep in the Settings menu. While most of these screens can be skipped in the setup, it still adds up time, but enabling ADB debugging cannot be avoided.\nAndroid 16 adds support for Trade-in Mode, which Google describes as a mode that provides quicker access to key device details at the point of sale, and makes it faster to trade in a device, get a refund, and upgrade.\nGoogle doesn\u2019t share more details on what is happening behind the scenes, but we already know the nitty gritty behind trade-in mode. Essentially, this mode allows a very limited version of ADB to be available to Android devices right on the first screen of the setup wizard. This makes it easier for technicians to run automated diagnostics for device inspections.\nThe setup wizard enables ADB trade-in mode and disables it after setup has been completed. The technician can use ADB trade-in mode to put the device into an \u201cevaluation mode\u201d and bypass the setup, but it will also force a factory reset on the next boot. Alternatively, another command can be run to retrieve diagnostic information about the device and see if it passes an attestation challenge.\nOutline text for maximum text contrast\nWith Android 16 Beta 3, Google introduced outline text, which replaces high-contrast text by drawing larger contrasting areas around text to greatly improve legibility.\nVulkan, the official graphics API for Android\nGoogle announced in March 2025 that Vulkan is the official graphics API for Android. Android already supported Vulkan graphics API since Android 7.0 Nougat in 2016, but only a small percentage of active devices supported it back then. The situation is now significantly different, hence the change.\nAccording to Google, this change enables developers to add more immersive visuals to their games. Vulkan allows developers to capitalize on the performance of modern smartphone GPUs to unlock features like ray tracing in games or multithreading.\nWhat does it actually mean for Android to make Vulkan its official graphics API, though? Essentially, Google aims to establish Vulkan as the GPU hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for Android, requiring all apps and games utilizing the phone\u2019s GPU to do so through Vulkan. This includes: game engines, middleware, and layered APIs like Android\u2019s HWUI, Skia, WebGPU, and ANGLE.\nStarting with Android 16, Google says that \u201cmore devices will use Vulkan to process all graphics commands.\u201d Specifically, Android 16 will require some newer devices to use ANGLE for some applications (meaning, only applications on an approved list will use ANGLE).\nFurther, Google introduced Vulkan Profiles for Android (VPA) last year to improve consistency in Vulkan feature availability across Android devices. VPA defines a set of Vulkan features that GPUs must support to pass Google\u2019s certification testing for a given Android release.\nVPA 16, aimed at next-generation chipsets launching with support for Android 16, will require support for Host Image Copy, a feature that\u2019s part of the core Vulkan 1.4 specification that one Google engineer calls a \u201cgame changer for games on Android.\u201d This feature allows games to copy image data, such as textures, using the device\u2019s CPU instead of the GPU. Host Image Copy will prove particularly useful for Android games, as it enables faster app loads, reduces stutter, and lowers GPU memory usage.\niOS-like App Settings with SettingsPreferenceService API\nAndroid 16 adds a new API that lets apps integrate their own settings with the Android Settings app, similar to what we already see on iOS, albeit it\u2019s not widely adopted there, either, outside of Apple\u2019s own apps. If this API becomes broadly adopted on Android by third-party apps, it could transform Android Settings into a one-stop shop for both device and app settings.\nIn-process software audio codecs\nAndroid 16 adds support for in-process software audio codecs, a feature that allows media codecs to run within an app\u2019s process instead of within the usual sandboxed media codec process. The in-process operation, though potentially risky, is deemed safe because the codec\u2019s software implementation is written in a memory-safe language like Rust.\nWhile Android 16 supports this feature, it\u2019s not in use yet, as the respective vendors will need to rewrite the media codecs in Rust. Thus, while Android 16\u2019s new in-process software audio codecs feature should theoretically bring better performance and battery life when playing back media, it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t see these benefits for quite some time.\nCloud compilation for app installs\nAndroid 16 now supports cloud compilation, a new feature that could speed up new app installs. The goal of cloud compilation would be to avoid running the dex2oat tool during app installations by offloading compilation to the cloud.\nIdentity check coming to more phones and apps\nWith Android 16, more Android phones will be getting access to Android\u2019s Identity Check feature.\nCurrently, only Pixel and Samsung phones have this feature, as it requires changes to an underlying biometric prompt code. Since this is part of a non-updatable OS component, the feature requires an OS update to arrive on more devices.\nWith Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, Google is expanding Identity Check to cover any app that uses the biometric prompt API. When Identity Check is turned on and someone tries to access an app that invokes this API, Android 16 QPR2 won\u2019t allow your screen lock credentials to be used as a fallback. Instead, it will enforce biometric authentication, preventing unauthorized access to your sensitive apps outside of trusted locations.\nIdentity Check will soon also let you use your smartwatch as a trusted unlock mechanism. When your phone is in an untrusted location but connected to a trusted smartwatch, Identity Check won\u2019t require biometric authentication. This other feature isn\u2019t available yet, but we could see it roll out in a future beta release.\nCustomizable keyboard shortcuts\nAndroid has many keyboard shortcuts for system actions and launching apps. In past releases, these were not customizable. Android 16 now lets you edit them, so for example, you could add \u201cMeta + Shift + B\u201d as an alternative key combination to launch the Chrome browser.\nPixel: Battery Health page\nGoogle has added a new battery health screen to Android 16 Beta 3, and the feature is live for Pixel devices with Android 16 stable release. This screen attempts to quantify exactly how good your phone\u2019s battery health is.\nIt not only displays your estimated battery capacity as a percentage of what a new battery for your phone is capable of, it also surfaces some actionable insights to help you get the most out of it. This feature is available on Pixel 8a and newer, but not on the Pixel 8 series and older due to \u201cproduct limitations.\u201d\nStandardized picture and audio quality framework for TVs\nAndroid 16 offers a set of standardized APIs for access to audio and picture profiles and hardware-related settings on TVs. This allows streaming apps to query profiles and apply them to media dynamically. For example:\n- Movies mastered with a wider dynamic range require greater color accuracy to see subtle details in shadows and adjust to ambient light, so a profile that prefers color accuracy over brightness may be appropriate.\n- Live sporting events are often mastered with a narrow dynamic range, but are usually watched in daylight, so a profile that prefers brightness over color accuracy can give better results.\n- Fully interactive content wants minimal processing to reduce latency and wants higher frame rates, which is why many TVs ship with a game profile.\nThe API allows apps to switch between these profiles, thus letting users enjoy the benefits of tuning supported TVs to match the content.\nAndroid 16: Leaked and upcoming features\nGoogle has shared some details about Android 16 through its official announcements, but we\u2019ve spotted a ton of changes in Google\u2019s QPR updates that help paint a more complete picture of the changes we can expect to see in the final Android 16 release.\nGoogle\u2019s QPR updates and what they tell us about future Android releases\nThe Android platform follows an annual release schedule, which OEMs and the world at large have access to. Google also follows a second public release schedule for its Pixel devices in the form of QPR updates. QPR refers to Quarterly Platform Release, which is an update track where updates are released once every three months (quarter). So, we generally get an annual Android platform update on Pixels, followed by three QPR releases, and then the next annual Android platform update.\nWhile the features included in the Android platform update are final and available to the world, features released in the QPR updates are available to Pixel devices until the next Android platform update incorporates them. Further, Google also runs a separate beta program for the QPRs months in advance.\nThis gives us situations where we can try out new features coming to Android 16 (by checking them out in Android 15 QPR1 betas) before the stable Android 16 update is even launched! Later QPR betas give us even more features that can be chalked up to the next platform release.\nAs a result, we have a list of features that are coming to upcoming Android 15 QPR releases for Pixel devices, which are also likely to be added to the next Android platform update, Android 16. Let\u2019s check them out!\nAll leaked and upcoming features in Android 16:\n- Local Network Protection\n- Intrusion Logging\n- Improvements to Factory Reset Protection\n- Material 3 Expressive\n- Android's big UI overhaul\n- Desktop windowing\n- Redesigned Settings homepage with Expressive Settings\n- Redesigned volume slider and volume panel\n- New status bar icons\n- Force dark mode\n- Tiny taskbar for phones\n- \"Even dimmer\" display brightness\n- Rich Ongoing Notifications\n- Blocking old notifications\n- Compact heads-up notifications\n- Semi-transparent notifications\n- Gemini-powered Notification \"Magic Actions\"\n- New screen recording and casting chips\n- Quick Settings changes: Dual shade design, Categories, Resizing, and more\n- New \"Video Chat\" panel for video call effects\n- New \"switch users\" widget\n- Lock screen minimalism and compact notification layout\n- Gemini button on the lock screen\n- Lock screen note-taking\n- Redesigned lock screen\n- Stash notification bubbles\n- Open any app in a floating bubble\n- Do Not Disturb mode changes, introduction of Priority mode, and renaming to Modes\n- Time zone change notification\n- Better split-screen multitasking on phones\n- Three-way split-screen multitasking on tablets\n- More improvements to the screen recording system\n- App switcher during partial screen sharing\n- Redesigned media output switcher\n- Contacts Storage page for backing up contacts\n- Corner swipe gesture for invoking the default assistant\n- Keyboard shortcut menu in the side navigation rail\n- Touchpad gesture tutorial\n- PC-like external display management features\n- Android's Desktop Mode\n- \"Postured\" trigger for screen saver\n- Dedicated \"Supervision\" page for certain parental controls\n- New Terminal app to run Linux apps in a virtual machine\n- Parallel Module Loading\n- Pixel: Redesigned Pixel wallpaper app\n- Pixel: New lock screen clock options and customization\n- Pixel: Customize the shapes of home screen icons\n- Pixel: Recent apps in taskbar\n- Pixel: Manually set 80% charging limit\n- Pixel: Screen-off fingerprint unlock\n- Pixel: Hide launcher widgets behind a menu\n- Pixel: Double tap to turn off screen\n- Pixel: Pixel Thermometer app shortcut\n- Pixel: Robust open/close detection\n- Pixel: Pixel phones get Linux kernel 6.1 update\n- Android 16 for TVs\n- Smaller changes\nNote: Features marked exclusively for Pixel devices could arrive in Android 15 Quarterly Platform Releases too.\nLocal Network Protection\nAndroid 16 Beta 3 officially adds the ability to test the upcoming Local Network Protection feature, which Google says is planned for a future Android major release.\nEssentially, any app with the \u201cINTERNET\u201d permission can communicate with the Internet worldwide and with devices on the user\u2019s local network. Local Network Protection will eventually require apps to request specific permission to access the local network. With Android 16 Beta 3, Google is giving app developers a chance to test if their apps are affected by this upcoming change.\nIntrusion Logging\nGoogle announced Intrusion Logging as a new feature in Android 16 that will help users detect if their device has been compromised. Intrusion Logging collects \u201cactivity logs\u201d which include details such as USB connection events, network info like browsing history, app installs, Bluetooth connections, lock screen info, and Wi-Fi connections. Your activity logs are encrypted using your Google account password and device lock screen, ensuring only you can view them. These logs are stored in a \u201cprivate and encrypted Google Drive,\u201d providing further protection against unauthorized access.\nWhile the API is already available in Android 16, Google hasn\u2019t yet integrated Intrusion Logging into Google Play Services. Consequently, the feature will roll out later in the year, possibly as part of an Android 16 QPR rather than with the launch of Android 16.\nImprovements to Factory Reset Protection\nAt The Android Show: I/O Edition, Google announced that Android\u2019s existing Factory Reset Protection mechanisms will become even more powerful later in the year. While Android already has several mechanisms to deter bypassing the setup screen after triggering a factory reset, these new protections will restrict all functionalities on devices that are reset without the owner\u2019s authorization.\nAndroid will likely detect if someone bypassed the setup wizard (to bypass previous factory reset protection mechanisms), and will thus force another factory reset cyclically, preventing unauthorized use until the user proves ownership.\nSince these upgrades are coming later in the year, they will not be part of the first stable release of Android 16. Instead, we expect this update to come with the Android 16 QPR1 update.\nMaterial 3 Expressive\nGoogle has officially announced Material 3 Expressive as the next evolution of Material Design. This UX update is set to arrive with Android 16, but not the first stable release. Instead, it will come with Android 16 QPR1 to Pixels, meaning most non-Pixels will get access to this with Android 17, albeit individual apps could have their own redesign on Android 16.\n\u201cSo, the updates for Material Expressive are going to be available on Pixel devices first later this year, but it\u2019s not going to be part of the public release in June,\u201d confirmed Allen Huang, Google\u2019s Director of Product Management for Pixel and Android system UI.\nThis sweeping UI update is a significant step in Google\u2019s ongoing effort to make Android and Wear OS more visually engaging, emotionally resonant, and interactive. Some of its highlights include:\n- Springier, natural-feeling animations that enhance touch interactions\n- New icon shapes and refreshed typography\n- Background blur effects for depth and focus\n- Updated color themes\n- Home screen and Quick Settings enhancements for a more dynamic layout\n- Visual redesigns for many Google apps, bringing them in line with the new expressive aesthetic\nYou can learn more about Material 3 Expressive in our deep dive article.\nAndroid\u2019s big UI overhaul\nThis change is so big that it deserves its own section. With the above-mentioned Material 3 Expressive changes, Google is also planning a big UI overhaul for Android and expressive animations to accompany it. These changes were spotted and activated within Android 16 Beta 4, but they are unlikely to be available with the Android 16 stable release. Instead, they could come with a future QPR release or Android 17 and beyond.\nAs part of the UI overhaul, we expect changes across several important areas, like status bar icons, clock font, combined notifications, Quick Settings panel, cleaner lock screen with collapsed notifications, and so much more. The changes are quite voluminous to list here, so do check out our original coverage for the whole scoop.\nDesktop windowing\nWe\u2019ve talked about desktop windowing before as a leak, but Google officially introduced the feature in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 for the Pixel Tablet. Google\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t mention the release timeline, but we expect to see the feature in the wider Android 16 release.\nDesktop windowing allows users to run multiple apps simultaneously and resize app windows, just like we\u2019re used to doing on conventional desktops.\nGoogle has fixed the taskbar\u2019s position to the bottom of the screen. It can now show running apps and apps pinned by the user. There is also a new header bar, which houses window controls.\nIn addition to the announced feature, there\u2019s a new hidden toggle called Enable desktop mode on secondary display, which replaces the old Force desktop mode toggle.\nFurther, in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1, we also managed to activate the button for \u201cmulti-instance property,\u201d which is likely referring to a new window button in the drop-down menu. The button launches a new instance of the app in another window.\nThe header bar now has a minimize button, which we spotted and activated in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 and subsequently became available for all with Android 16 Beta 3. Tapping the minimize button minimizes a window.\nWhen an app\u2019s window is minimized, it can be reopened by tapping the app\u2019s icon in the taskbar.\nSimilar to conventional desktop platforms, the bar underneath the app\u2019s icon turns gray and shrinks when an app is minimized. When every app window is minimized, Android exits desktop windowing mode.\nAndroid 15 QPR2 Beta 1 release has also introduced an \u201capp-to-web\u201d feature for desktop windowing.\nFor select apps like Google Photos, an \u201copen in browser\u201d option will appear in the dropdown menu. Tapping this opens the website associated with the app. You can also tap the settings cog to choose whether to open web links in the app or in your browser.\nWith Android 16 Beta 3, Google added the ability to put apps like YouTube into picture-in-picture mode and the ability to drag a Chrome tab to open it in its own window.\nRedesigned Settings homepage with Expressive Settings\nAndroid 15 Beta 3 included clues for a redesigned Settings homepage, but the changes didn\u2019t go live in later betas. The new settings layout did go live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, indicating that it is possibly on track for an Android 16 release.\nOn the left is an example of how the top-level page looks on Android 14 and the right image shows the new layout in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.\nBeyond this, Google is working on an even bigger redesign. We spotted Expressive Design for the Settings app in Android 16 Beta 3 and activated it to give you an early preview.\nThis Expressive Design for the Settings app features newer Material You switches with an X or checkmark icon in the handle. Each item in Settings will be placed in separate, visually distinct cards. Small arrow icons will indicate when an item in Settings has a subpage. Finally, most pages will display the header at the very top, allowing for more items to be shown at first glance.\nWith Android 16 Beta 4, the Expressive Design for the Settings app gained colorful new icons for each entry, as you can see in the images below:\nThis Expressive Settings will live alongside the main Settings homepage redesign, as that remains unchanged. Further, Expressive Settings have not rolled out with the main Android 16 release, but will likely make it to future Android 16 QPR releases.\nRedesigned volume slider and volume panel\nWe managed to activate a new volume panel UI in Android 16 Developer Preview 2. This volume panel ditches the thick, pill-shaped sliders in favor of thinner, continuous sliders with handles.\nGoogle is also working to update the volume slider to match this new design. As you can see below, the volume slider in Android 16 will be less rounded and will have a thin rectangular handle. The icon indicating the current volume stream that\u2019s being controlled will sit at the bottom of the slider instead of at the top. The three dots at the bottom, which open the full volume panel, are slightly smaller in the new design.\nWhile the volume mode icon at the top has remained the same, the mode selector has been tweaked to show other modes in discrete rounded rectangles.\nIt\u2019s possible that Google is merely testing this design and could abandon it in the future. So we will have to see if it makes it to the stable version of Android 16.\nNew status bar icons\nWith Android 16 Beta 3, we spotted some changes to status bar icons as a carryover work from changes that were spotted before Android 15 but never made it to release. Now in the new status bar icons, the Wi-Fi signal strength icon displays three segments instead of five.\nMore significantly, though, the battery level icon shows a dynamic color scheme depending on the battery status.\nWhen the battery is sufficient and not charging, the background color is solid white. When the battery is low and not charging, the background color turns red. Finally, when the device is charging, the background color turns vivid green. The battery level percentage is also bolder, and the icon is also flipped.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee Google will roll out these new icons. If they do, they might appear in a quarterly Android 16 release or in next year\u2019s Android 17 update.\nForce dark mode\nDespite dark themes in apps gaining popularity when the feature was launched, many apps have not bothered implementing one. We spotted a \u201cmake all apps dark\u201d feature back in Android 14 QPR2 Beta 2 that forced every app to go dark, even if the app didn\u2019t have its own dark theme. The feature didn\u2019t go live in the subsequent stable Android 15 release, though.\nIn Android 16 Beta 1, the feature continues to show signs of development.\nIt is now renamed \u201cmake more apps dark\u201d and is a hidden setting in Settings > Display & touch > Dark theme. The feature\u2019s description says that it \u201cautomatically convert[s] light-themed apps to dark theme.\u201d\nTiny taskbar for phones\nWith Android 15 Beta 4, we spotted mentions of a \u201ctiny taskbar\u201d feature for phones, which we managed to activate to show off the experience:\nWith Android 16 Beta 4, Google fixed the duplicate navigation handle that appeared when the tiny taskbar was enabled. Google also upgraded the tiny taskbar\u2019s multitasking by adding a button that opens a carousel showing the six most recently opened apps.\nCuriously, this recent apps carousel isn\u2019t available on tablet\u2019s taskbar. Despite the progress in the feature\u2019s functionality, it\u2019s not ready for prime time yet, and may arrive in future Android releases.\n\u201cEven dimmer\u201d display brightness\nGoogle has been testing an \u201ceven dimmer\u201d display brightness option for Android. As the name suggests, this setting toggle would allow your phone\u2019s display to go dimmer than usual. This feature could work alongside adaptive brightness, going even dimmer than usual when the ambient lighting is super low but automatically returning to normal brightness when the ambient lighting is high.\nThe key difference between Android 12\u2019s Extra Dim accessibility feature and the upcoming Even Dimmer feature is that Even Dimmer is meant to be toggled and forgotten as the adaptive brightness will take care of the dimming, while Extra Dim is a manual toggle for going lower in brightness. Because Even Dimmer basically accomplishes the same thing as Extra Dim, the latter feature will disappear when the former rolls out. Android will even remove the Extra Dim shortcut from the Quick Settings panel to get you to migrate to the new feature.\nNormally, the brightness bar\u2019s lowest value sets your device\u2019s screen to the lowest brightness level allowed by its hardware, but with Even Dimmer enabled, the OS will apply an additional dimming layer when the brightness bar is at its lowest value. Disabling Even Dimmer just requires you to slide the brightness bar to the right, which you probably do multiple times a day already, making it much more likely you won\u2019t accidentally keep it enabled. Unlike Extra Dim, you won\u2019t have to remember to turn Even Dimmer on when you\u2019re in the dark or turn it off when it\u2019s no longer dark around you \u2014 otherwise, your phone\u2019s screen will be dimmer than it should be during the day.\nWith Android 16 DP1, Even Dimmer was available on the Pixel 9. On the other hand, Android 16 DP2 introduced a new version of Extra Dim on the Pixel 9 that no longer needs to be manually toggled. Instead, it is built into the brightness slider\nRich Ongoing Notifications\nAs we learned from clues within Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3, Android 16 could introduce Rich Ongoing Notifications, a new API that lets apps show more than just an icon in the status bar. The API will let apps create chips with their own text and background color that live in the status bar, sort of like the new screen recording chips (mentioned in the later parts of this article). It\u2019s likely that tapping these chips will open some sort of dialog provided by the app that shows more information about the ongoing notification.\nFor example, here\u2019s a gallery that shows what the Rich Ongoing Notifications API could be used for in Android 16, using mock notifications for various apps like Uber, the United Airlines app, and the Clock.\nThe feature appears inspired by iOS\u2019s Dynamic Island, but it predates the feature. Android 12 added an API that lets dialer apps show the duration of an ongoing call in a status bar chip a full year before Apple introduced its Dynamic Island feature. Android 16 opening up status bar chips to all apps would be a major expansion of the feature.\nBlocking old notifications\nPeople who own and use multiple Android devices can relate to the notification flood that arrives whenever they boot up the less frequently used device. Right at boot, after the device establishes its internet connection, you\u2019ll receive all notifications that weren\u2019t delivered to this device, even if you have checked out the notifications from your other device.\nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 changed the way Android handles these older notifications. The system now rejects notifications that are more than two weeks old. These older notifications will only show some details to let you know which apps or contacts to check up on, but they will no longer alert you with a sound or vibration, or even show the full notification contents.\nCompact heads-up notifications\nIf you are bothered by just how large the heads-up notifications can be when watching full-screen content, then Google is working on a solution. We spotted clues for compact heads-up notifications in Android 15 Beta 4, and the feature became more widely available with Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.\nYou can see the compact layout in the second set of notifications below.\nMost of the text in the notification is truncated, and any embedded images are hidden by default until you tap the dropdown arrow to expand them. However, the notification icon, notification title, and reply button are still shown for messaging apps like Telegram.\nSemi-transparent notifications\nWe spotted Google working on a new semi-transparent notifications feature in Android 16 Beta 3 and managed to activate it. Specifically, heads-up notifications and notifications shown on the lock screen were now semi-transparent, whereas notifications in the notifications panel were unchanged.\nGiven that these semi-transparent notifications make content harder to read due to the lower contrast, there\u2019s a low chance that Google will actually roll out the design in any future release of Android, let alone Android 16. However, Google could choose to add some transparency to other areas of the UX.\nGemini-powered Notification \u201cMagic Actions\u201d\nIn 2018, Android 9 released Smart Reply, which provides suggested replies as tappable chips beneath a notification for quick responses. Android 10 expanded this with Smart Actions, offering contextual actions based on notification content. This Smart Actions feature powers the \u201cOpen Maps\u201d chip when a notification includes an address. Smart Replies and Smart Actions are powered by on-device machine learning models, but are limited to short, canned replies that might not fully appreciate the context.\nWe\u2019ve spotted evidence with Android 16 that suggests Google is developing a more advanced version of Smart Actions, dubbed \u201cMagic Actions.\u201d When the Magic Action feature is enabled, Android will hide Smart Actions and instead prominently display a new Magic Action button. This button is slated to receive \u201cspecial visual treatment,\u201d possibly indicating a custom animation when it appears or is tapped. Speculatively, the feature could tap into Google\u2019s Gemini model to generate more personalized and powerful actions.\nNew screen recording and casting chips\nAndroid 16 could improve the screen recorder and screen caster indicator chips. We spotted and activated the change in Android 15 Beta 4.2, and the chips became more widely available in QPR1 Beta 2, which gives us hope for it arriving on Android 16.\nStarting with the changes, the new chips for screen recording and screencasting will give you a timer right in the status bar.\nThey will also let you stop the screen recording or screencasting session without needing to pull down the status bar. Tapping on the chip will open a dialog that will let you stop the session.\nThere\u2019s also a different icon now to indicate when a third-party app requests to record or cast the screen. The dialog more prominently asks you whether you want to \u201cshare your screen\u201d rather than \u201cstart recording or casting.\u201d\nThe experience is fairly functional, so we\u2019re hoping to see it go live for the wide platform with Android 16.\nQuick Settings changes: Dual shade design, Categories, Resizing, and more\nQuick Settings is in for an overhaul with Android 16. Starting off, Google is testing a new dual shade design for Android 16 that separates the Quick Settings panels from the notification shade, which we managed to activate in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.\nPulling down the status bar once still brings down the notifications panel like before, but the panel now takes up about a quarter of the screen rather than the entire thing. While you can\u2019t see any Quick Settings tiles anymore in the new notifications dropdown, you can see the app that\u2019s underneath the panel.\nPulling down the status bar a second time no longer brings down the Quick Settings panel. Instead, the Quick Settings panel is accessed by pulling down the status bar with two fingers.\nAfter pulling the Quick Settings panel down, you can swipe left or right between pages to see all your tiles. The brightness bar still appears at the top, but now has a text label and shows the brightness level as you adjust it, similar to the new volume sliders in Android 15. Most Quick Settings tiles have been made smaller so more of them can fit on one page, which is a welcome change.\nHere\u2019s a video that demonstrates the new notification and Quick Settings panels described above:\nFlexiglass is the internal codename for the rearchitecting that Google is doing to SystemUI to make it more stable.\nWith Android 16 Beta 3, we managed to activate the dual-page panel UI to give you a fresher demo of it:\nThis build fixes several deficiencies present in previous builds. For instance, the media player is prominently present at the top. There are also two new ways to switch between the Notifications and Quick Settings panels. First, you can simply tap the chips at the top left and right to open the respective panels. Second, swiping down on the left side opens the notifications panel, while swiping down on the right opens the Quick Settings panel.\nGoogle also made the Quick Settings panel vertically scrolling, allowing you to fill up the entire screen with tiles. It also added clear plus and minus buttons to each tile in the edit menu, making it easier to add or remove tiles from the panel.\nFurther, you\u2019ll notice that the clock is much larger in the new beta. This clock also follows the same style that is set for the lock screen clock, changing as you change it.\nWith Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3, we spotted other changes. When the in-development Quick Settings panel is enabled, the Quick Settings tiles become resizable. You can tap on any tile while in the editor view and then drag the dot left or right to shrink or expand it. Tiles can be either 1\u00d71 or 2\u00d71 in size, allowing you to fit as few as eight or as many as 16 tiles on a single page. You can resize any tile, even ones provided by third-party apps, though obviously, not every tile will have a useful description when it\u2019s expanded.\nFor comparison, here\u2019s an image that shows the default Quick Settings layout in Android 15 vs Android 16:\nAnd here\u2019s an image that shows some more Quick Settings panel layouts you\u2019ll be able to make thanks to this feature:\nHere\u2019s a short video that demonstrates how you\u2019ll be able to resize Quick Settings tiles in Android 16:\nWith Android 16 Beta 2, Google is making it more explicit that the Quick Settings editing interface isn\u2019t merely for resizing and rearranging icons. Large plus and minus symbols are now present to make it abundantly clear that you can add and remove Quick Settings tiles.\nIn addition to these changes, the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Quick Settings tiles could once again become one-click toggles. If you notice in the screenshots above, the tiles for these two settings aren\u2019t fully filled in for background color like the other tiles were. That is for a reason: tapping the icon would toggle the respective setting as it did in Android 14 while tapping the rest of the tile would open the panel as it does in Android 15.\nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 1 also includes a new animation when you long-press on the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Quick Settings tiles.\nAlongside, Android 16 will also organize the Quick Settings tiles into categories. We spotted strings within Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3 that suggest the Quick Settings panel will organize tiles into at most seven different categories. These categories include Accessibility, Connectivity, Display, Privacy, Provided by apps, Unknown, and Utilities. They will appear in the Quick Settings editor, similar to what you can see below:\nThe system won\u2019t show categories for which you have already added the available tiles.\nThe revamped Quick Settings panel was earlier reported to require a two-finger swipe down to reveal it. With the release of Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3, Google has seemingly dropped this plan, letting you pull down the revamped Quick Settings tile from the right side of the status bar with a single finger instead of two fingers.\nHowever, there\u2019s no way to swipe between the notifications and the Quick Settings panel.\nFurther, Google is also considering changes to the expanded behavior of the Internet and Bluetooth tiles, going back to behavior found in relatively early Android versions. We managed to activate the change, wherein the Internet and Bluetooth tiles no longer popped out into floating panels but rather expanded to fill up the area within the Quick Settings panel, similar to how things worked in Android 5.1 to Android 8.1.\nHowever, the feature is clearly still in development, as evidenced by the duplicated text and lack of data in the expanded tiles.\nGoogle has confirmed several parts of this extensive Quick Settings redesign, including the resizable tiles, one-click toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, updated brightness slider, blurred background for the Quick Settings and notifications panel, and the updated tile editor. You can see the confirmed changes in the video below:\nNew \u201cVideo Chat\u201d panel for video call effects\nAndroid 16 Beta 4 includes strings for a new Quick Settings tile called Video Chat. The strings show that Android will support effects like background blur (which blurs your background environment), portrait relighting (which improves the lighting on your face), portrait touch-up (which retouches your face to remove imperfections), and studio-style mic (which suppresses background noise). For background blur, you\u2019ll have the option to apply a light blur or a full blur to the background. The portrait relighting, portrait touch-up, and studio-style mic effects are simple on/off toggles.\nWe managed to activate the Video Chat Quick Settings tile and panel, and here\u2019s what it looks like:\nThese effects don\u2019t work yet. However, we expect these effects to work in any video chat app, as there would otherwise be little point in creating a dedicated Quick Settings panel for them.\nNew \u201cswitch users\u201d widget\nWith Android 16 Beta 2, Google has added a new multiuser widget called \u201cswitch users.\u201d As the name implies, this widget lets you quickly switch users. It features large buttons that prominently show the user\u2019s profile picture, and there\u2019s also a button on the top right to open Android\u2019s multiuser settings page.\nLock screen minimalism\nWe spotted a new feature within Android 15 QPR2 Beta that lets you declutter your lock screen without forcing you to unlock your phone to see your notifications. This feature is called lock screen notification minimalism and, when it goes live, can be found under Settings > Notifications.\nThe lock screen notification minimalism feature seems to hide everything but the icons for notifications. Here\u2019s a comparison of what the lock screen looks like before and after the lock screen notification minimalism feature is enabled:\nWhen this setting is enabled, however, only the app icon is shown in a small pill below the clock. Tapping this pill expands the notifications panel so you can see the entire content of each notification. While this lock screen notification minimalism feature does make it slightly less convenient to see your notifications, it significantly declutters your lock screen so you can see the beautiful wallpaper you set for it.\nThis lock screen notification minimalism feature has been removed from the Android 15 QPR2 Beta 3 build. In its place is a new \u201ccompact\u201d notification layout option for the lock screen. This new setting can be found in the Settings app under the Notifications on lock screen settings. Previously, notifications on the lock screen were a dialog that lets you choose whether to show all notification content, hide all notification content, or show sensitive content only when unlocked, but Google is turning it into a page with more options.\nOn the new page, you can choose to have new notifications collapsed into a shelf on your lock screen (the \u201ccompact\u201d option) or shown in a full list (the \u201cfull list\u201d option). The description for the full list option, which states that it\u2019s the \u201ccurrent default placement,\u201d suggests that Android 16 won\u2019t force the new compact layout on users.\nGemini button on the lock screen\nWe\u2019ve spotted a flag within Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 that possibly enables another way to invoke Gemini, this time through a lock screen button. This flag controls the presence of a button on the lock screen that, when tapped, doesn\u2019t do anything right now but could likely trigger the AI assistant (given the sparkle icon).\nThe button is pill-shaped and sits right below the fingerprint reader. It\u2019s larger than the two lock screen shortcuts at the bottom and has a sparkle icon in the middle.\nSince this change was spotted with Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 intended for Pixel devices, it could be incorporated into future versions of the Android platform.\nLock screen note-taking\nGoogle has long been working on a feature that would let you jot notes through Google Keep on the lock screen of Android tablets. This feature was expected to arrive with Android 15, but it didn\u2019t.\nMore recently, with Android 16 Developer Preview 2, Google has made Keep a system app, meaning users cannot easily uninstall it. While Google could have other reasons for doing so, this change could also be a step forward for the lock screen note-taking feature.\nRedesigned lock screen\nIn addition to all the above features, Google is also working on a redesigned layout for the lock screen, which looks cleaner than the current one when populated.\nHere\u2019s what the current lock screen looks like:\nHere\u2019s what we managed to activate in Android 16 Beta 4:\nPrimarily, this lock screen redesign relocates the At a Glance widget\u2019s complications. The date and weather complications move below the clock when it\u2019s centered and to the right of the clock when it\u2019s at the top. The informational complication is now separate, sitting at the top when there are no notifications and below the clock when notifications are present.\nStash notification bubbles\nGoogle introduced the Bubbles API with Android 11 in 2020, allowing messaging apps to open conversations in a floating window. The floating window sits on top of other apps so you can quickly see or respond to messages from your favorite contacts. When you\u2019re done chatting, you can minimize the floating window, which turns it into a small, floating icon that you can later tap to restore the window.\nBubbles are either always fully visible or hidden, with no in-between state. We managed to activate a third state in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, referred to as \u201cstashing.\u201d Bubble stashing lets you stash these notification bubbles to the side of the screen when they are not in use.\nOpen any app in a floating bubble\nWhile the Bubbles feature mentioned above is great, it only works for conversation notifications and can be opted out, so many apps don\u2019t support it. However, in theory, most Android apps should work just fine when placed inside a floating window. Code within Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 suggests Google is testing this theory, as it includes references to a \u201cbubble anything\u201d feature.\nOnce activated, the Pixel Launcher adds a \u201cbubble\u201d button to the context menu that appears when you press and hold on any app on the home screen. Tapping this button opens the app \u2014 no matter what it is \u2014 in a floating bubble, as you can see below.\nHere\u2019s a video demonstrating what Android\u2019s new \u201cbubble anything\u201d feature combined with the upcoming bubble bar will look like on tablets:\nSince this change was spotted with Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 intended for Pixel devices, it could be incorporated into future versions of the Android platform.\nWith Android 16 Beta 4, we spotted Google working to bring the bubble bar to phones:\nThe bubble bar on phones will allow users to switch between more than two apps. The expanded bubble bar only shows the five most recently opened bubbles, though the bubble overflow menu does list other, previously opened bubbles. Google is also developing different categories of bubbles: chat, note, app, and shortcut. These categories will determine whether an app badge is displayed.\nDo Not Disturb mode changes, introduction of Priority mode, and renaming to Modes\nGoogle is working to supercharge Android\u2019s Do Not Disturb mode with a new Priority mode. We spotted extensive clues within Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1, indicating that Google is planning to rename the Do Not Disturb mode entry point, tweak its UI, add a new Quick Settings tile, and introduce many other customization options.\nThe new DND mode UI that we activated has new toggles to enable grayscale mode, disable the always-on display, dim the wallpaper, and enable the dark theme. These four options take advantage of the new ZenDeviceEffects API.\nThe scheduling options from DND mode are being transferred to a custom Priority Mode. This new Priority Modes menu lets you create a fully custom DND mode schedule with its own name, icon, activation trigger, display settings, and notification settings.\nIf you\u2019re worried about DND taking two taps to activate, we\u2019ve spotted clues in Android 16 Beta 4 that indicate that Google is also working on a new, dedicated Do Not Disturb mode tile specifically for toggling it. This new tile looks and functions exactly like the original one did before Android 15 QPR2 introduced the Modes panel. Importantly, this new dedicated Do Not Disturb tile will exist alongside the current Modes tile. This means users can choose to add the new dedicated Do Not Disturb tile, keep the existing Modes tile, use both, or use neither in their Quick Settings.\nThere\u2019s also a new Quick Settings tile for the Priority Mode, which co-exists alongside the DND mode tile.\nWith Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, Google changed some behaviors related to Priority mode and also gave us a deeper look. The Quick Settings tile opens a dialog that lets you quickly choose which Priority Modes to enable and tells you how many are enabled, if any.\nThe updates to the Priority Modes menu in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 starts with the new intro screen for the preexisting modes, Event and Sleeping. Currently, though, the graphic used for each intro screen is a placeholder, but Google will likely update these in a future release. Another change to the menu in QPR1 Beta 2 is the new UI for customizing the activation trigger and notification settings. In addition, the mode icon now lights up when it\u2019s turned on.\nGoogle has also added many new icons to choose from when creating a custom Priority Mode. While you can\u2019t upload your own icon, Android now offers 40 icons to choose from in QPR1 Beta 2.\nIn Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3, \u201cPriority Modes\u201d has been rebranded to just \u201cModes.\u201d Google also added an icon in the status bar, lock screen, and AOD to correspond to the current mode that is enabled, making it much easier to tell at a glance.\nGoogle also slightly tweaked the UI for the dialog that appears when you tap the Quick Settings tile. Modes are now displayed in a single-column, vertically scrolling list instead of a dual-column list.\nAnother small tweak is that the Quick Settings tile itself now displays the icon of the first mode that you enable. It also shows the name of the first mode but switches to the number of modes active if more than one is enabled. Speaking of which, if you ever have more than one mode enabled, then only the first one\u2019s icon will appear on the status bar, lock screen, and AOD.\nSince this change was spotted with Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1, Beta 2, and Beta 3 intended for Pixel devices, it will be incorporated into future versions of the Android platform.\nTime zone change notification\nYour Android phone can automatically adjust the time when you enter a new time zone. However, you are not notified of such a change.\nIn Android 16 Beta 1, we spotted strings for a new \u201ctime zone change\u201d feature that will appear under Settings > System > Date & time. The description says that the feature will let you \u201creceive a notification when your time zone is automatically updated.\u201d\nThe notification\u2019s title will explain that \u201cyour time zone changed,\u201d and the body will include exactly what time zone you\u2019re now in.\nThis Time zone change notification went live in July 2025 Android Canary release. It may roll out to users with Android 16 QPR2 in December 2025, which would also mark it for the platform release for Android 17.\nBetter split-screen multitasking on phones\nAndroid\u2019s split screen feature lets you display two apps side-by-side, either in a 50:50 ratio (i.e., divided evenly in half) or in a 70:30 ratio. With the release of Android 16 DP2, Google quietly updated the code for Android\u2019s split-screen mode to support a 90:10 ratio.\nWe managed to activate the 90:10 split-screen mode to give you a demo:\nThis change has the potential to offer several benefits. The 90:10 ratio is ideal for focusing on one app while keeping another open for quick reference. Tapping the smaller app window instantly enlarges it. While the existing 70:30 split offers similar functionality in theory, on smaller Android phone screens, the 70% portion can still feel cramped, while the 30% portion might be larger than necessary. Having a 90:10 option just adds greater flexibility.\nThree-way split-screen multitasking on tablets\nIn Android 16 Developer Preview 2, we spotted code for an in-development \u201cflexible\u201d split-screen mode and managed to activate it partially for the preview below:\nThis mode could work similarly to OnePlus Open\u2019s Open Canvas feature, which lets you run up to three apps side-by-side. Two apps share 90% of the screen, and the third occupies the remaining 10%.\nThe genius of Open Canvas is that, while the third app is usually far too small to be usable, it can be quickly enlarged by tapping anywhere on the app window. Tapping like that shifts the screen so that the leftmost app now takes up 10% of the screen while the middle and rightmost apps take up the remaining 90%. You can swap app positions, change apps by dragging and dropping from the taskbar, or view all three apps by performing a four-finger pinch gesture.\nIt remains to be seen if Google implements all the gestures as Open Canvas.\nMore improvements to the screen recording system\nAndroid 16 could improve the screen recorder and screen caster indicator chips. We spotted and activated the change in Android 15 Beta 4.2, but the changes could arrive on Android 15 in a future QPR release and, thus, on the wider platform with Android 16. The chips also became more widely available in QPR1 Beta 2, indicating a probable release for the QPR update and then on Android 16.\nFor one, the new chips for screen recording and screencasting will give you a timer right in the status bar.\nThey will also let you stop the screen recording or screencasting session without needing to pull down the status bar. Tapping on the chip will open a dialog that will let you stop the session.\nThere\u2019s also a different icon now to indicate when a third-party app requests to record or cast the screen. The dialog more prominently asks you whether you want to \u201cshare your screen\u201d rather than \u201cstart recording or casting.\u201d\nThe experience is fairly functional, but it remains anyone\u2019s guess when it actually arrives. With Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, the system stops screen shares initiated by third-party apps when you lock the device.\nApp switcher during partial screen sharing\nAndroid 15 introduces a more private screen recording system that lets you record or cast a single app instead of your entire screen. However, if you need to change the app you are recording or casting, you have to end the current session and start a new one.\nWe spotted a flag within Android 15\u2019s source code that enables a \u201ctask switcher feature for partial screen sharing.\u201d After enabling this flag, when you start screen recording or screen casting an app and then switch to a different app, a new notification appears.\nThis notification informs the user that \u201csharing pauses when you switch apps.\u201d The notification has two buttons: \u201cShare this app instead\u201d and \u201cSwitch back.\u201d Tapping \u201cswitch back\u201d launches the app with which the screen recording or casting session was started. Tapping \u201cshare this app instead\u201d does nothing, though, as it appears the task switcher feature for partial screen sharing isn\u2019t fully functional yet. It\u2019s possible that this feature could get activated for Android 16.\nRedesigned media output switcher\nWith Android 16 Beta 4, we found code for a redesigned media output switcher. This panel pops out when you tap the chip in the top right of any media playback notification.\nBelow is the current UI for the media output switcher, as seen in Android 15 on a Pixel device:\nIn contrast, here\u2019s the new UI for the media output switcher that Google is experimenting with in Android 16 Beta 4:\nThe \u201cconnect a device\u201d button has moved from the bottom of the list to just below the media info at the top. Second, the slider controlling the volume for the current output device has been tweaked. Instead of a thick, pill-shaped slider with the device name enclosed within, it\u2019s now a thinner, continuous slider with the device name placed above the handle. The slider also shows a more appropriate icon for connected devices \u2014 in this case, a pair of earbuds. Lastly, the large pill enclosing each device under \u201cSpeakers & Displays\u201d is gone, the only downgrade in this redesign.\nContacts Storage page for backing up contacts\nAndroid has long allowed you to back up your contacts to your Google account, but Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 includes code that indicates Google could be working on adding a dedicated Contacts Storage page to centralize the setting. This page will contain toggles to choose which account to sync contacts to, a button to add an account, and a toggle to disable contact syncing entirely.\nCorner swipe gesture for invoking the default assistant\nWith the introduction of Circle to Search, Google hijacked the long-press home button gesture (when using the three-button navigation system) from invoking the default assistant and made it launch the Circle to Search feature instead. Even if you disabled Circle to Search, you won\u2019t get the gesture back on the three-button navigation system.\nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 3 includes code for a new corner swipe gesture that will let you invoke the default assistant even when using three-button navigation.\nAs you can see, you will have to swipe diagonally inwards from the corner to launch your device\u2019s default assistant.\nKeyboard shortcut menu in the side navigation rail\nAndroid lets you navigate its UI using keyboard shortcuts. Because there are so many keyboard shortcuts available, Android also has a dedicated menu listing them.\nTo help make the keyboard shortcut menu easier to use on tablets, Google could add the menu to the side navigation rail. We found code for this in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, and here\u2019s what it would look like:\nThe redesigned keyboard shortcut menu should thus be easier to use on tablets since the shortcut categories will be closer to the left edge of the display. Since the change was spotted in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 intended for Pixel devices, it could be incorporated into future versions of the Android platform.\nTouchpad gesture tutorial\nWe spotted a new tutorial for touchpad gestures in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2. Google has created custom animations that explain how some of Android\u2019s touchpad gestures work. These animations simulate the gesture used to go back (swiping left or right with three fingers), the gesture to go home (swiping up with three fingers), and the gesture to open the app drawer (pressing the action key on the keyboard).\nIt also created a notification that appears when the user connects a touchpad for the first time, inviting them to try the gestures.\nAlthough Android also supports gestures to open the recent apps screen (swiping up with three fingers, then holding), open the notifications panel (swiping down with three fingers), and switch between apps (swiping left or right with four fingers), the tutorial in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 doesn\u2019t mention all of these. It\u2019s likely that Google isn\u2019t finished with this tutorial just yet and that it will be updated in a future beta.\nSince the change was spotted in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 intended for Pixel devices, it could be incorporated into future versions of the Android platform.\nPC-like external display management features\nGoogle is testing new external display management tools in Android 16 that bring Android closer to other desktop OSes. Android has a few issues when extending the screen from an Android phone to an external display \u2014 the mouse is fixed to one screen and can\u2019t be moved between displays, and Android doesn\u2019t let you switch between mirroring the screen and extending it, forcing you to tweak developer options and then reconnect the phone to change display modes.\nTo address the first issue, Google is enabling mouse cursor transitions across connected displays and adding the ability to rearrange them. The solution to the second issue is to add a toggle that switches between mirroring the built-in display and extending it. We managed to enable both of these PC-like external display management features in Android 16 Beta 2.1:\nWe\u2019ve also spotted a new \u2018Enable desktop experience features\u2019 option that will soon appear in developer options to let you enable Desktop View on secondary displays. These desktop experience features can likely be enabled on secondary displays only or on both the device and secondary displays. We managed to enable the button in Android 16 Beta 3 but couldn\u2019t get the feature itself to work.\nWith Android 16 Beta 3, Google also added the ability to screen record the external display when your Android phone is connected to an external monitor.\nAndroid\u2019s Desktop Mode\nWith Android 16 Beta 4, we managed to activate Android\u2019s desktop mode. Given the feature\u2019s unfinished state, we expect it to arrive either with a later Android 16 QPR release or with Android 17.\nCompared to the current, barebones desktop interface that appears when you connect a Pixel device to an external display, Android\u2019s new desktop mode actually displays the taskbar and status bar. The taskbar is a big addition, as it provides access to your pinned apps and a better version of the app drawer. The taskbar can also show recent apps while in desktop mode, making it easier to multitask.\nIt\u2019s also possible to launch multiple apps in floating windows simultaneously using the new desktop mode. Further, you can freely move, resize, or snap windows to the side, just like on desktop operating systems. This makes it easy to drag and drop content from one app to another, provided the apps you\u2019re using support drag-and-drop.\nThere\u2019s more work to be done on this feature, so we expect to learn more in the coming months.\n\u201cPostured\u201d trigger for screen saver\nAndroid offers two ways to trigger the screen saver: while charging, or while docked and charging. The first option activates the screen saver whenever the device is charging, regardless of how or its physical state. The second option activates it only when the device is both charging and docked.\nAndroid relies on the dock itself to pass along the docking state information, but unfortunately, many charging stands aren\u2019t recognized as docks. Users have to thus use the charging trigger, which also gets triggered when the device is laid flat on a bedside dock, for example.\nWith Android 16, Google could introduce a new screen saver trigger called \u201cpostured,\u201d which requires the device to be sitting upright, not flat. This would solve the problem of the screen saver triggering when the device is charging while laid flat on a table, as the screen saver will basically only activate when the device is upright and charging on a stand.\nNew Terminal app to run Linux apps in a virtual machine\nAndroid 15 QPR2 Beta 1 added a new \u201cLinux development environment\u201d toggle in Developer Settings, that lets you \u201crun [a] Linux terminal on Android.\u201d After enabling this option, a new Terminal app appears in the app list.\nThe Terminal app will download, configure, run, and interface with an instance of Debian (a popular Linux distribution) in a virtual machine. This will seemingly let developers run Linux apps on their Android devices through a virtual machine. We\u2019ve played around with the feature and even managed to run Doom on Android 16\u2019s Linux Terminal. With Android 16 Beta 4, Google uncapped the disk resize slider in the Linux Terminal app\u2019s settings, letting users resize the disk to occupy most of the host device\u2019s storage. We\u2019ve even managed to improve memory availability since the app is limited to 4GB of RAM, which can be insufficient for developers.\nDedicated \u201cSupervision\u201d page for certain parental controls\nGoogle offers the \u201cFamily Link\u201d parental control suite that makes it easy to create a managed Google Account for your child with explicit content filters enabled in Chrome and Google Search. The Family Link app provides a centralized hub for managing your child\u2019s online activities, and you can easily access it either through the dedicated Android app or within Android\u2019s Digital Wellbeing settings.\nWith Android 16 Beta 4, we managed to activate the dedicated \u201cSupervision\u201d entry within the Settings app.\nTo enable device supervision, you must enter a new PIN for the supervised account. Once you enable supervision, you can then activate web content filters for that account. By default, the system allows all websites and search results, but you can change these settings to block explicit sites in Chrome and explicit images, text, and links in Search. While these content filters won\u2019t block all explicit content, they should effectively hide most inappropriate material on the web.\nParallel Module Loading\nGoogle is making a change that speeds up an early part of the Android OS\u2019s multi-stage initialization process. The stage in question happens after the Linux kernel is loaded, and it sets up the basic environment necessary for the later stages of the boot process to take place.\nDuring this stage, Android loads essential kernel modules, which are pieces of code that extend the kernel\u2019s functionality and which can be loaded and unloaded on demand. Google is proposing a change called Parallel Module Loading to tweak how Android loads these modules. This would remove a bottleneck that previously existed, resulting in a noticeable improvement in module loading times. It remains to be seen how much of this improvement users will be able to experience in boot times, if at all they are noticeable.\nPixel: Redesigned Pixel wallpaper app\nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 1 includes clues around a redesign of the Pixel wallpaper app, aka the app called Wallpaper & Style on Pixel devices.\nHere\u2019s a video that compares the Pixel wallpaper app\u2019s current UI to the in-development one we enabled.\nFor starters, the tabs to switch between customizing the home screen and customizing the lock screen are now gone. Instead, to switch from customizing the home screen to customizing the lock screen (or vice versa), you now simply swipe from one to the other in the carousel underneath where it says \u201cWallpaper & style.\u201d\nThe next big change is to how lock screen clock customization is handled. Instead of swiping left or right to cycle through the available lock screen clock styles, all the available options will be shown in a bottom sheet. The lock screen clock color and size customization settings are also contained within this new bottom sheet, albeit in separate tabs.\nLikewise, the lock screen shortcut customization UI is now part of a bottom sheet instead of a separate page. With this change, you no longer need to scroll to see all available lock screen shortcuts, as up to 10 shortcuts can fit on the sheet (only nine shortcuts currently exist for phones).\nThe same is true for the new system color palette picker, which shows two rows of palette options instead of one. Selecting a color palette causes the home screen preview to zoom in, allowing you to better preview the changes to your icons. The option to toggle the dark theme also appears when the preview zooms in, so you can quickly preview how your home screen looks with the dark theme enabled, too.\nNote that the in-development UI is far from finished, so many features and assets are missing. Still, this early look gives us a good idea of what to expect from the new version of the app when it goes live in a future update.\nPixel: New lock screen clock options and customization\nWith Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2, we spotted that the Pixel Wallpaper app has new clock style options.\nGoogle is also preparing to add a new page for customizing the lock screen clock size, one that lets you tweak the weight, width, roundness, and slant. This page will be accessed by tapping a new pencil/edit button shown on top of each lock screen clock style card. While we weren\u2019t able to get this pencil/edit button to appear, we were able to manually launch the new lock screen clock size page, as shown in the video below:\nPixel: Customize the shapes of home screen icons\nThe Pixel Launcher in Android 11 used to let users customize the icon shapes for home screen icons, but this functionality was removed in Android 12. Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 brings back the ability to customize the icon shapes for home screen icons, indicating the feature could make an appearance in the stable branch in a future stable release.\nThe in-development version of the Pixel wallpaper app (aka Wallpaper & Style) now contains a new \u201capp shape & layout\u201d menu in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1. This menu has two tabs: Shape and Layout. The Layout tab has familiar options for changing the layout of the home screen grid, while the Shape tab has six different options for changing the shape of home screen icons.\nPixel: Recent apps in taskbar\nOn Pixel foldables and tablets, the Android taskbar currently shows six apps pinned to the dock and two suggested apps. Although the Pixel Launcher suggests apps based on your recently used apps, they\u2019re also based on those you most frequently use and your \u201croutines.\u201d\nAndroid 15 QPR1 Beta 2 includes code that suggests that Google could swap the app suggestions on the taskbar with recently used apps.\nIn the above video, you can see the two suggested apps getting replaced with the two most recently used apps.\nSince this change was spotted with Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 intended for Pixel devices, it could be incorporated into future versions of the Android platform. Many Android manufacturers already highlight recently used apps in the taskbar, so this change will benefit the Android platform at large.\nPixel: Manually set 80% charging limit\nGoogle Pixel smartphones have an Adaptive Charging feature that monitors your charging habits and limits charging to 80% until about one hour before the system predicts you\u2019ll unplug your phone. This feature could be updated to add an option to manually cap charging at 80%.\nThe feature was spotted in Android 15 Beta 4.2 and rolled out more widely with Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2, so it will likely reach Pixel devices in a future QPR update or with Android 16.\nPixel: Screen-off fingerprint unlock\nWith Android 16 Developer Preview 2, Google added a new setting for Pixel 9 devices that allows users to use the fingerprint sensor without switching on the display. This new setting is called \u201cScreen-off Fingerprint Unlock\u201d and is present under Settings > Security & privacy > Device unlock > Face & Fingerprint Unlock > Fingerprint Unlock.\nThe Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature is quite straightforward and works exactly as described on Pixel devices with an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. Here\u2019s a short video demonstrating it:\nWith the release of Android 16 Beta 3, Google expanded the compatibility of this feature to all Pixel phones. However, with Android 16 Beta 4, Google mysteriously removed the feature, albeit users who activated it previously could still use it.\nPixel: Hide launcher widgets behind a menu\nAndroid 16 Developer Preview 2 includes code that suggests Google is preparing to tweak the Pixel Launcher so that its widget list does not show all available widgets by default. The widget list will add a new button to show all widgets, which will help clean up the menu if you have many apps or widget apps installed.\nPixel: Double tap to turn off screen\nIn Android 16 Beta 4, there\u2019s evidence that Google is working to add a gesture to turn off the screen with a double-tap on the lock screen, and we managed to activate the gesture for a first look.\nWith this new gesture, you can double-tap on an empty spot of the lock screen to turn off your Pixel phone\u2019s screen.\nWith Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1, we also managed to activate its Settings menu entry. When it goes live, the feature will be in Settings > System > Gestures.\nMany Android phones already have this feature on their skins, but it would be the first time Pixels get it. The feature could also come to the broader Android platform.\nPixel: Pixel Thermometer app shortcut\nAndroid 16 Beta 4 includes code that indicates that Google could add a \u201cThermometer\u201d option to Android\u2019s lock screen shortcut customization page, intended for use with the Pixel Thermometer. We activated the feature to give you a look:\nPixel: Robust open/close detection\nThe fourth beta of Android 16 has brought a new display setting to the Pixel Fold and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. This setting, called \u201crobust open/close detection,\u201d is said to help your Pixel foldable more accurately tell whether it is open or closed. However, the feature increases battery usage.\nEven though the feature has surfaced, it\u2019s not immediately clear if it is functional yet.\nPixel: Pixel phones get Linux kernel 6.1 update\nWith the release of Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1, Google pushed out a major Linux kernel version upgrade to all its Tensor-powered Pixels, unifying the kernel version across Tensor devices.\nThe Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7a, Pixel Tablet, and Pixel Fold are all being upgraded from Linux kernel 5.10 to 6.1, whereas the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel 8a are being upgraded from Linux kernel 5.15 to 6.1. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 9 series was already running Linux 6.1, so there aren\u2019t any changes for these devices.\nThis Linux kernel bump for Pixel devices will go a long way toward the Longevity GRF program.\nAndroid 16 for TVs\nWith the release of Android 16, Google is also apparently moving the TV-based Android TV operating system to a bi-yearly release schedule. This means that smart TVs on Android TV 14 could skip Android TV 15 and directly get the Android TV 16 update. Google\u2019s I/O 2025 schedule mentions \u201cpreparing for Android 16 for TV,\u201d so it\u2019s coming for sure.\nNote that the Android TV operating system is quite different from the conventional Android operating system, so the changelog for the Android TV 16 update will be different from the platform changelog for the Android 16 update for smartphones.\nSmaller changes\nThere are plenty of smaller changes that we expected will be available in Android 16, based on leaked features:\n- Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 tweaks the Bluetooth device details page to show a small ring indicating the connected device\u2019s current battery level.\n- Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 includes an intensity slider for color correction settings. This slider lets you tweak the intensity of the color balance changes within the color correction modes.\n- Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 includes customizations for the mouse pointer. These include a new pointer fill style selector, a pointer stroke style selector, and a pointer scale slider. They can be found under Settings > System > Touchpad & mouse.\n- Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 and Beta 2 include a new keyboard switcher button. This button appears as a wireframe globe located under the keys and to the right of the hide button. The switcher dialog also looks more modern and is placed much lower on the screen to make it easier to select with one hand.\n- Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 included new strings describing a settings page for external displays. Beta 2 included the change for the External Display page. This page allows the user to adjust the display resolution and rotation of external displays that are connected to a Pixel 8 series or Pixel 9 series device.\n- Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 includes a new predictive back gesture animation for the keyboard.\n- Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3 includes code that suggests Android could soon introduce a system-wide audio input switcher. This will let you switch what microphone is being used at a system-level, without relying on apps to pack in that setting at their individual level.\n- Android could give you a new notification when you dismiss the floating accessibility button. This notification would make it easier to bring it back in case you need to temporarily dismiss it. The change was spotted within the Android 15 source code but is not currently live in Android 15, so it could come with Android 16.\n- Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 includes code that enables or modifies three keyboard accessibility features:\n- You will soon be able to choose the bounce key threshold or the duration of time your keyboard ignores repeated key presses. You can set the threshold to 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s, or a custom time ranging from 0.1 to 5s.\n- The new repeat keys feature will let you \u201chold down a key to repeat its character until the key is released.\u201d\n- The mouse swap feature will let you swap the actions of the left and right mouse buttons. In other words, a left click becomes a right click, and a right click becomes a left click.\n- Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 includes code that adds a new mouse reverse scrolling accessibility feature that simply changes the direction of mouse scrolls. When it\u2019s enabled, moving the mouse wheel up will move the page down and vice versa.\n- Android 16 DP2 includes a new menu for customizing three-finger touchpad taps.\n- Pixel: Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 pre-installs the VPN by Google service on the Pixel Tablet, bringing it back.\nAndroid 16: Leaked Pixel-exclusive features coming with Android 16 QPR releases\nAs mentioned earlier, Google releases QPR updates for Pixel devices, which tend to pack in features before they make their way to the subsequent Android platform update. However, if the feature is Pixel-exclusive, it won\u2019t be coming to the Android platform update. Thus, these Pixel-exclusive features can be deemed to arrive on the base Android platform itself instead of a subsequent release.\nFor example, generic features spotted in Android 16 QPR1 betas will be coming to the wider platform with Android 17. However, if Pixel-specific features are spotted in Android 16 QPR1 betas, they will likely arrive on Pixels when the betas graduate to the stable branch, or in subsequent Android 16 QPRs.\nHere are the Pixel-exclusive features that could arrive with Android 16 QPR releases:\n- Pixel: Pixel Themes\n- Pixel: Google Photos curated wallpaper\n- Pixel: Magic Portrait and Dynamic Weather effects on lock screen\n- Pixel: Lock screen clock size customization\n- Pixel: Lock screen clock style customization\n- Pixel: Lock screen widgets\n- Pixel: Wallpaper Studio within Wallpaper & Style app\n- Pixel: Gemini Space\n- Pixel: Native flashlight brightness\n- Pixel: Check enrolled fingerprints\n- Pixel: Pixel Launcher\u2019s new search bar design\n- Pixel: Battery Health Assistance\n- Pixel: Notification organizer, previously known as Bundled notifications\n- Pixel: Notification summary\n- Pixel: Screenshot editing with Pixel Studio\nPixel: Pixel Themes\nIn Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1, we managed to activate a new \u201cThemes\u201d entry in the Wallpaper & Style app present on Pixel devices, as well as a new themes-related chip that appears underneath the wallpaper preview.\nHowever, neither the button nor the chip currently work. It remains unclear whether the feature will come to Pixels with QPR1 or later QPRs, or Android 17.\nPixel: Google Photos curated wallpaper\nAfter updating the Google Photos app to v7.31 and applying all the available Google Play System updates, the Wallpaper and Styles app on Google Pixels on Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 now suggests wallpapers from your Google Photos libraries in the main wallpaper selection screen.\nWe can see six photos as suggestions. It seems the images are selected with a bias towards people and pets.\nPixel: Magic Portrait and Dynamic Weather effects on lock screen\nThe Pixel wallpaper app in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 contains a new option called Magic Portait, accessed by opening the app, tapping the lock screen preview, and then selecting the \u201ceffects\u201d button. Users can then select Magic Portrait to get the system to analyse the lock screen wallpaper and automatically cut out a portion to place within a frame.\nWhile the default frame is an oval, several other shapes are available, including a rounded square and a clover. An opaque background surrounds the frame, helping to highlight it. Users can choose from a few background color options, though a color wheel for precise color selection isn\u2019t available.\nUsers can alternatively choose to apply a Dynamic Weather effect, including options like fog, rain, snow, and sun.\nPixel: Lock screen clock size customization\nGoogle has been working to revamp the Pixel wallpaper app, first enabled by us in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1, and finally enabled by Google itself for all Pixel users with Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1. This revamped Pixel wallpaper app has a new UI to change the lock screen\u2019s appearance. It also has a slider to adjust the clock\u2019s weight and width, although these changes apply only to the default clock.\nThis slider is only available for the default clock because it\u2019s the only one using a \u201creactive\u201d font that allows for dynamic adjustment.\nPixel: Lock screen clock style customization\nIn Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2, within the Wallpaper & Style app, you can trigger a hidden customization feature. Tap on the lock screen clock preview in the default clock font to switch between Rounded and Sharp options.\nPixel: Lock screen widgets\nAndroid used to allow lock screen widgets in its early days, but the feature was removed in Android 5.0 Lollipop in 2014. Google has been working on bringing back lock screen widget support, and Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2 finally adds them for the Pixel Tablet.\nTo access them, swipe inward from the right edge of the lock screen. Then, tap the \u201ccustomize\u201d card to open the widget editor, where you can add, remove, or reorder your widgets.\nWith Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1, we managed to activate a feature that lets you resize any lock screen widget to take up an entire column. This will allow certain widgets to show more information at a glance, as demonstrated in the video embedded below:\nThese widgets are currently intended for tablets only, not phones. However, if you are curious, lock screen widgets will indeed come to phones, too. Google has mentioned that lock screen widgets will be available in AOSP for tablets and mobile with the release of Android 16 QPR1, slated to arrive in late Summer 2025.\nWe managed to activate it on Android 16 Beta 2.1 for a demo:\nAs you can see in the video above, lock screen widgets on phones will work differently than they do on tablets. The 2\u00d73 grid seen on tablets is too wide for the narrow displays of most phones, so Google\u2019s solution is to display one column of widgets at a time. More importantly, the \u201cglanceable hub\u201d isn\u2019t accessed by swiping inward from the right edge of the lock screen, as it is on tablets. Instead, it\u2019s accessed by triggering the screen saver by placing the phone on a charger or docking it and, in the future, by placing it upright on a stand.\nGoogle says that OEMs can customize the mechanism that triggers the lock screen widget experience but not the interface itself.\nWith the release of Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, lock screen widgets are finally available on phones.\nPixel: Wallpaper Studio within Wallpaper & Style app\nWith Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2, Google is rounding up various wallpaper customization-related options into the Wallpaper & Style app\u2019s Wallpaper Studio section.\nThis new section offers familiar tools under one roof. The features aren\u2019t new, but they are now organized in one handy section.\nPixel: Gemini Space\nWithin the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 release, we spotted clues that indicate Google could be considering revamping the At a Glance feature within Pixel devices, upgrading it to Gemini Space. Specifically, \u201cGemini Space\u201d could be Google\u2019s version of the \u201cNow Bar\u201d and \u201cNow Brief\u201d features on Samsung Galaxy phones.\nOn recent Galaxy flagships, the Now Bar is a small chip on the lock screen with live app updates. It is complemented by Now Brief, a full-screen summary of your day with contextual information, accessed from its Now Bar lock screen shortcut, the Now Brief home screen widget, or the Edge panel.\nAt a Glance can be argued to be very similar to Now Bar already, while Gemini Space could be comparable to Now Brief. A new Daily Hub feature would exist within Gemini Space that would \u201cshow a space for content and suggestions to simplify your day.\u201d\nWe await more information about Gemini Space.\nPixel: Native flashlight brightness\nSamsung Galaxy devices have offered flashlight brightness controls for years, but stock Android only added support for the underlying functionality with the Android 13 release in 2022. This update introduced an API that allows apps to control flashlight brightness, provided the phone\u2019s hardware supports it. Despite this, Pixel devices cannot control the brightness natively, even though the phones support it at the hardware level.\nWithin Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2, code suggests an entry for Flashlight Strength will be added to the Quick Settings toggle.\nTapping the tile\u2019s icon will toggle the flashlight, while tapping its text label will open the new \u201cflashlight strength\u201d dialog with a slider. When the flashlight is enabled, the brightness level will be shown underneath the text label in the tile. If the tile has been shrunk, the brightness level won\u2019t be shown, and a long press will be required to open the dialog.\nPixel: Check enrolled fingerprints\nWith Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 release, Pixel devices have a new \u201ccheck enrolled fingerprints\u201d button in Android\u2019s Fingerprint Unlock settings. Tapping this button launches a screen with a black background, a fingerprint icon, and text that reads, \u201cTouch the fingerprint sensor.\u201d Pressing your finger against the fingerprint icon closes the page and highlights the matching fingerprint.\nPixel: Pixel Launcher\u2019s new search bar design\nWith Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2, Google gives the search bar widget on the Pixel Launcher\u2019s home screen a new segmented look. Instead of placing the AI Mode button within the search bar, this new design shrinks the old search bar and places a round AI Mode button to the right. The smaller search bar and AI Mode button are encapsulated in a larger pill with a contrasting background.\nPixel: Battery Health Assistance\nWith the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 release, some older Pixels are seeing a new Battery Health Assistance option:\nGoogle\u2019s support page notes that this feature \u201cadjusts the battery\u2019s maximum voltage\u201d in stages to help with long-term battery health. These voltage adjustments occur in stages, starting at 200 charging cycles and extending to 1,000 cycles. Unsurprisingly, the company adds that you might see small decreases in battery life and a \u201cslight change\u201d to charging performance.\nPixel: Notification organizer, previously known as Bundled notifications\nIn Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2, we managed to activate a hidden page for Bundled notifications, which is present at Settings > Notifications.\nThe description on the page says that \u201cnotifications with similar themes will be silenced and grouped together for a quieter experience. Bundling will override an app\u2019s own notification settings.\u201d\nSince its first spotting, the feature has been renamed Notification Organizer to describe its functions more accurately. The feature will use AI to analyze your incoming alerts and, when it identifies a match, will silence the notification and bundle it into one of four categories:\n- Promotions: Sales, new features, and more\n- News: Top stories, editorials, and more\n- Social: Likes, posts, and more\n- Suggested: Newsletters, recommended media, and more\nThe feature\u2019s description now explicitly states that it\u2019s \u201cAI-powered and may contain errors.\u201d If a notification is categorized, its corresponding notification channel will be updated to ensure future, similar notifications are also bundled. You will also be able to exempt specific apps from being organized.\nThe core AI service that analyzes and sorts notifications is part of the Notification Assistant service, which is contained within the Android System Intelligence app and is not included in the open-source version of the OS. This indicates that the feature could potentially be Pixel-exclusive.\nPixel: Notification summary\nWe\u2019ve found strings within Android 16 Beta 3 that hint at a new \u201cnotification summaries\u201d page. This \u201cnotification summaries\u201d page will be positioned between the existing notification history and the upcoming notification bundle options under Settings > Notifications. The new page will have a single toggle to enable the feature, labeled \u201cuse notification summaries.\u201d\nThe feature\u2019s description states it will \u201cautomatically summarize conversation notifications from apps.\u201d Only messaging apps correctly categorize their notifications as conversation notifications, so only those would be AI summarized. The system will also let you exclude apps from having their notifications summarized.\nGoogle is designing this feature to be conservative in how frequently summaries are triggered. Android will only summarize notifications containing between 25 and 200 words, with a cap of 50 summaries per day. Furthermore, summaries are generated three minutes after a notification is received, possibly to conserve resources or to not interrupt users as they\u2019re reading it.\nIt\u2019s not clear when the feature will arrive on Android. It might not make it to the stable Android 16 release, but come through on an Android 16 QPR release or even on Android 17. The service that generates the summaries is part of the proprietary Android System Intelligence app, so the feature could be a Pixel-exclusive.\nPixel: Screenshot editing with Pixel Studio\nWith Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1 on Pixels, editing a screenshot opens it directly in the Pixel Studio app, offering a wider range of editing tools than the standard screenshot editor in Google Photos, including AI-powered editing.\nThese are all the changes we expect to see in the Android 16 platform update in 2025.

Learn more.\nSamsung Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra: Release date, pricing, colors, and everything else!\nJuly 16, 2025\nYou can\u2019t get a year started without a fleet of Samsung\u2019s best new smartphones, bringing together the hottest hardware advancements, most impressive AI features, and the latest and greatest edition of One UI.\nLet\u2019s not waste any time, as there is a ton you\u2019ll want to know about the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. Here we go!\nVastly improved software\n7 years of support\n12GB RAM\n7 years software support\nBig battery\n7 years software support\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: Release date, price, and availability\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 (12/128GB): $799.99\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus (12/256GB): $999.99\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (12/256GB): $1,299.99\nSamsung formally introduced the Galaxy S25 series at its first Unpacked of the year on January 22, 2025 \u2014 and just like last time around, hosted the event in San Jose, California. Following the pre-reservation period that could score you a $50 credit, pre-orders for the phones opened as Unpacked concluded. General retail availability got underway on February 7.\nApproaching this generation of Galaxy flagships after a year when seemingly everything got more expensive, we were curious if Samsung would leave pricing unchanged, or take advantage of inflationary trends to push prices to a new extreme. As it turns out, we had nothing to worry about, and Samsung came back with the same pricing breakdown we saw last year. That means the Galaxy S25 starts at $799, and the Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999. Those two have maintained that position for years and, with a little luck, will for at least a few more to come.\nWhile Samsung raised pricing for its highest-end flagship model with last year\u2019s S24 Ultra, it looks like the company has managed to get that urge out of its system, and the S25 Ultra also comes back this year at the same $1,299 level.\nWith microSD expansion having gone the way of the dodo, you\u2019ll want to make sure you pick up a Galaxy S25 model equipped with all the storage you\u2019ll need, not just for today and tomorrow, but for the next seven years of Android updates you\u2019ll be getting. Here\u2019s what your options look like:\nSamsung Galaxy S25:\n- 12GB/128GB: $799, \u00a3799\n- 12GB/256GB: $859, \u00a3859\n- 12GB/512GB: \u00a3959\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Plus:\n- 12GB/256GB: $999, \u00a3999\n- 12GB/512GB: $1,119, \u00a31,099\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra:\n- 12GB/256GB: $1,299, \u00a31,249\n- 12GB/512GB: $1,419, \u00a31,349\n- 12GB/1TB: $1659, \u00a31,549\nSamsung is selling the Galaxy S25 in markets all around the world, from the United States, to the United Kingdom, to the company\u2019s own South Korea. What\u2019s special this year is that we\u2019re not seeing a split between the choice of processor across markets. That said, the availability of different storage configurations may vary depending on where you live.\nFor instance, in the US, Samsung won\u2019t be selling the 512GB storage model of the standard Galaxy S25; the highest storage you can get on it will be 256GB. Similarly, you won\u2019t be able to pick up an S25 Plus with 1TB storage in the US, but you might have that variant available in other countries.\nWhile in the past Samsung has brought Snapdragon-powered Galaxy models to markets like the US, you\u2019d find Samsung-produced Exynos chips in Galaxy flagships in many international markets. That\u2019s not the case in 2025, and all Galaxy S25 phones run the custom Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.\nWhen it comes to buying a Galaxy S25, carriers can offer some fantastic deals, but the best spot for getting your order in is often directly with Samsung itself. That gets you access to not only some unique promo offers, but is also the only place you\u2019ll find the S25 Ultra in its Jetblack colorway.\nHow much storage are you choosing for your Galaxy S25 phone?\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: Specs\nWe\u2019ve already let the cat out of the bag when it comes to a couple of the biggest shifts in hardware with this year\u2019s Galaxy S models, as Samsung bumps base RAM up to 12GB for the Galaxy S25 and commits to Snapdragons all around with its processors. But there\u2019s just a bit more than that going on here, so peruse this table at your convenience for all the details.\n| Specs | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Specs Display | Samsung Galaxy S25 6.2-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 6.9-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate |\n| Specs Processor | Samsung Galaxy S25 Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm) |\n| Specs Main Camera | Samsung Galaxy S25 50MP Wide AF OIS 12MP Ultrawide 10MP 3x Tele AF OIS | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 50MP Wide AF OIS 12MP Ultrawide 10MP 3x Tele AF OIS | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 200MP Wide AF OIS 50MP Wide AF OIS 10MP 3x Tele AF OIS 50MP 5x Tele AF OIS |\n| Specs Selfie Camera | Samsung Galaxy S25 12MP Wide AF | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 12MP Wide AF | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 12MP Wide AF |\n| Specs Memory and Storage | Samsung Galaxy S25 12GB RAM | 128GB, 256GB Storage | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 12GB RAM | 256GB, 512GB Storage | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 12GB RAM | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Storage |\n| Specs Battery | Samsung Galaxy S25 4,000mAh | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 4,900mAh | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 5,000mAh |\n| Specs Charging | Samsung Galaxy S25 Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare |\n| Specs Connectivity | Samsung Galaxy S25 5G (sub6, mmW) Wi-Fi 7 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 5G (sub6, mmW) Wi-Fi 7 UWB | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 5G (sub6, mmW) Wi-Fi 7 UWB |\n| Specs Biometrics | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultrasonic Fingerprint, Face Recognition | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Ultrasonic Fingerprint, Face Recognition | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Ultrasonic Fingerprint, Face Recognition |\n| Specs Dimensions | Samsung Galaxy S25 70.5 x 146.9 x 7.2 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 75.8 x 158.4 x 7.3 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 77.6 x 162.8 x 8.2 |\n| Specs Weight | Samsung Galaxy S25 162g | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 190g | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 218g |\n| Specs OS | Samsung Galaxy S25 Android 15 / One UI 7 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Android 15 / One UI 7 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Android 15 / One UI 7 |\n| Specs Durability | Samsung Galaxy S25 IP68 Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 Armor Aluminum (Frame) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus IP68 Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 Armor Aluminum (Frame) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra IP68 Enhanced Corning Gorilla Armor (front glass) Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (rear glass) Titanium (Frame) |\n| Specs Colors | Samsung Galaxy S25 Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, Titan Whitesilver |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: Features\nWatching Samsung work on the One UI 7 beta ahead of the S25\u2019s release, we already knew a lot about new features coming to Galaxy smartphones, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. As the latest flagship line, the Galaxy S25 series isn\u2019t just equipped with some solid hardware upgrades, but picks up some noteworthy software enhancements and exclusives in the process. These are the highlights you\u2019re absolutely going to want to check out:\nCamera\nOnce again, Samsung saves its best camera package for its premium model, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra delivers with its quad-camera array, including a 200MP main camera and the return of the 50MP periscope telephoto option we saw debut with the Galaxy S24 Ultra. But even with those specs lining up, we still get new hardware here, like a 50MP ultrawide angle (UWA) lens.\nSome of the improvements in this generation might be a little subtle, but Samsung is definitely upping its game behind the scenes. That includes upgrades like increasing HDR fidelity from 8-bit to 10-bit, and cleaner macro performance due to less sensor crop. Another one you may feel more than you consciously notice is a big reduction in shutter lag.\nCamera hardware takes a back seat this generation, but the Ultra still manages to steal the show.\nSamsung is also bringing a spatio-temporal filter to its cameras, which is supposed to make it easier for these phones to distinguish between still and moving image elements. We\u2019re also seeing that same system used to enhance portrait mode performance. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this feature is available via the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip rather than being a Samsung-exclusive option. So other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones should benefit from this imaging tech as well.\nFor its smaller phones, Samsung\u2019s not delivering any surprises, and the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus end up as camera twins for another year. Sadly, neither of these two pick up the Ultra\u2019s new UWA camera. All three phones return with a 12MP front-facing camera; if it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it?\nPerformance\nWith the introduction of the Galaxy S23 a couple of years back, Samsung broke from tradition and, rather than splitting markets between S23 phones built with Snapdragon and Exynos processors, chose to go Snapdragon across the board. While the S24 was a return to that division, the S25 brings us back to a unified Qualcomm landscape, and every S25 model around the world will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.\nSamsung and Qualcomm have a close working relationship, and that \u201cfor Galaxy\u201d label should be all the hint you need that there are some special changes going on under the hood here. Compared to off-the-shelf Snapdragon 8 Elite components, the Galaxy S25 series silicon has been overclocked for even speedier performance.\nNo matter where you purchase your Galaxy S25 this year, you can count on Snapdragon 8 Elite performance.\nOne particular area where these Snapdragon 8 Elite chips are getting some extra attention is their image signal processor (ISP), which has been heavily modified for Samsung\u2019s needs.\nSamsung says this year\u2019s phones can deliver 37% more CPU performance and offer a 30% faster GPU than last year\u2019s Galaxy S24 models. We tested the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy in the Galaxy S25 series shortly after launch, so what did we discover? Well, the processor offers improved CPU performance compared to the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite, but similar GPU performance.\nThe other nice performance upgrade concerns the baby Galaxy S25. The cheapest Galaxy S24 only shipped with 8GB of RAM, while the S24 Plus and S24 Ultra had 12GB of RAM. Fortunately, all Galaxy S25 series models (including the vanilla model) have at least 12GB of RAM.\nWill you miss the Exynos version of the Galaxy S25?\nDisplay\nSamsung\u2019s not taking its flagship Android line back to the drawing board, and the look and feel of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra just carry the S24\u2019s influence into a new generation. While there\u2019s plenty that\u2019s evolving in 2025, there are also a lot of places where Samsung has already gotten to the point where it wants its phones to be \u2014 and that includes some display details. But even as the base Galaxy S25 and the S25 Plus keep their 6.2- and 6.7-inch screen sizes, respectively, the S25 Ultra moves from 6.8 to 6.9 inches.\nDespite that size increase, the phone itself shouldn\u2019t feel any larger than the S24 Ultra, thanks to smaller bezels that allow Samsung to squeeze more display real estate into hardware that\u2019s the same size.\nSamsung taps Corning for screen protection once again, giving the S25 and S25 Plus the same Gorilla Glass Victus 2 we saw with last year\u2019s models. The S24 Ultra helped introduce us to Corning\u2019s advanced Gorilla Armor, and we had heard to expect an upgraded version this time around. Sure enough, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is our first chance to experience second-generation Gorilla Armor, claiming a 40% improvement in durability.\nConsidering how the original Gorilla Armor saw Samsung dealing with a 60% decrease in service requests for screen damage compared to the S23 Ultra, we can only imagine how that might continue to drop off in the years to come. In addition to the strength improvements, Corning has also upgraded its anti-reflection coating for optimum visibility in all kinds of conditions.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nIt really feels like this year is one of subtle refinement for Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S series, and while some fans will be disappointed to not see the company taking a bolder approach to design, those who have been craving a few targeted improvements may find a lot to appreciate here.\nEven as the overall look of the S25 series largely mirrors that of S24 phones, the Ultra model more closely aligns with its smaller siblings as it adopts curved corners this year. That seems like it\u2019s a further step away from the idea of the Ultra as a Note replacement \u2014 and honestly, this change is just going to feel a whole lot less pokey in our pockets.\nThe silhouettes of our S25 trio don\u2019t diverge much from their S24 predecessors, but all three have gone on a diet, and weigh in noticeably less than last time around. While the S24 series tipped the scales at 168, 197, and 233 grams, the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra only come in at 162, 190, and 218 grams, respectively. With the Ultra particularly, that\u2019s an immediately obvious improvement, and the phone feels stunningly light from the moment you pick it up.\nThere\u2019s also a decrease in thickness across the board, though on a scale of fractions of millimeters. All three S25 phones should be reasonably well equipped to resist environmental damage, with IP68 ratings and metal frames \u2014 aluminum for the S25 and Plus, and titanium on the Ultra.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of blue-ish, metallic shades, boy does Samsung have just the lineup of colorways for you. The Galaxy S25 gets us started with four main colors: Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow. Those are the same four options you have with the Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung\u2019s giving both these phones access to the same online exclusive colors if you order direct from the manufacturer: Blueblack, Coral Red, and Pinkgold.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra gets its own selection of colors, but these don\u2019t come across as hugely distinct from the rest of these silvery hues. You have your choice of Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, and Titan Whitesilver. Titanium Pinkgold, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Jadegreen are available via Samsung\u2019s website. Did you remember that the S25 Ultra has a titanium frame? Samsung seems afraid you\u2019ll forget.\nEspecially with these online-exclusive colors available at Samsung.com, the company tends to limit availability to specific markets, so you probably won\u2019t have your choice of all of them. You\u2019re definitely going to want to check out Samsung\u2019s site in your own country to get an accurate look at the options available to you.\nWhat do you think of Samsung's Galaxy S25 series color options?\nBattery life and charging\nNo matter how flashy a new phone is, it\u2019s no good to anyone with a dead battery, and power endurance continues to be a major concern for smartphone buyers everywhere.\nWith phone hardware that doesn\u2019t make any major size changes compared to last year, it shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that we\u2019re looking at the same battery capacities across the lineup. That spells a 4,000mAh battery for the Galaxy S25, the return of a nice, big 4,900mAh component for the Galaxy S25 Plus, and the S25 Ultra going with the same 5,000mAh battery size these models have used since time immemorial.\nGalaxy S25 phones will work with a magnetic Qi2 charger \u2014 if you pick up the right case.\nWe\u2019re also not seeing any changes when it comes to charging speed. With the Galaxy S25, that means that you\u2019re going to top out at using the phone with a 25W charging adapter. For the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra, you can go as high as 45W \u2014 just keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to pick up a compatible phone charger to take full advantage.\nIt looked hopeful for a moment that we might score some upgrades this generation in terms of wireless charging, maybe even getting 25W support, but we\u2019re stuck with the same 15W wireless maximum. There are also no magnets built into any of the Galaxy S25 models for Qi2 support. Samsung has worked with case manufacturers to make sure that third-party options that add magnets will align precisely with Samsung\u2019s charging coils, but that\u2019s hardly the graceful solution we craved.\nAll three Galaxy S25 phones support Wireless PowerShare for fueling your other devices in a pinch.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra S Pen\nSamsung\u2019s active stylus solution has long been a big selling point for Galaxy flagships, with the Note having passed the torch to Galaxy S Ultra models. But while past years have pushed limits in terms of S Pen functionality and ergonomics, Samsung\u2019s priorities have begun to shift with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThe big change this year is that Samsung is dropping support for the S Pen\u2019s Bluetooth functionality. This means losing access to Air Control and a host of other Bluetooth-connected features. This isn\u2019t just about the Ultra\u2019s built-in S Pen, either, and even if you bring your own S Pen Pro, the phone won\u2019t connect to it over Bluetooth. That\u2019s a bummer, but Samsung says that not enough users were taking advantage of the support to justify keeping it.\nIt\u2019s not all a wash, though, and Samsung has tweaked the way the S Pen docks in the Ultra to feel more flush this time around. On the downside, that can make getting it out a little more difficult, but we\u2019re sure a lot of owners will still appreciate this.\nOne UI 7: Software and updates\nSamsung already set a high bar for itself last year when it matched Google to offer seven years of software support for the Galaxy S24 series. That practice is only set to continue with its new Galaxy S25 phones, and all three of these models will get seven years of security updates as well as seven years of new Android releases. Sure, most of us are going to upgrade our handsets long before we even get close to that cutoff, but we are still so grateful to see manufacturers like Samsung even giving us the option to keep using devices for this long.\nOne UI 7 may be Samsung's most anticipated release in years, and it debuts with the Galaxy S25.\nGoogle\u2019s rollout of Android 15 was a little weird in 2024, and even the company\u2019s own Pixel 9 phones arrived without it. Samsung got its own public beta program going much later than we\u2019re used to, inviting owners of Galaxy S24 phones to help test One UI 7. The company wrapped up One UI 7 testing ahead of the Galaxy S25\u2019s launch, making this Samsung\u2019s first hardware to debut with Android 15 and this latest incarnation of the company\u2019s skin.\nThe Galaxy S24 already showed Samsung\u2019s clear investment in AI-powered features, and it\u2019s only doubling down on that commitment with One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25. That includes some big changes, like Gemini rising to join Bixby as your AI assistant tag team. That can\u2019t have been an easy decision for Samsung, but is one that\u2019s probably going to be the best for Galaxy S25 users.\nGemini is only a taste of all the AI functionality Samsung has prioritized with the Galaxy S25 and One UI 7, so let\u2019s get right into what you can look forward to.\nGalaxy AI features\nOnce again, Samsung is back with Galaxy AI branding to summarize all the AI-fueled features you\u2019ll find on its flagship phones, including those cooked up in-house and those that tap into Google\u2019s own AI prowess. While some hardware upgrades this generation are only available on the company\u2019s highest-end Ultra model, we\u2019re happy to see that there\u2019s no such exclusivity when it comes to Galaxy AI, and these features are available across the entire Galaxy S25 lineup.\nBetween the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip claiming a 40% boost in NPU performance for AI tasks, and Samsung\u2019s move to give all its S25 phones 12GB of RAM, this series is better equipped than ever before for doing some seriously advanced AI number crunching right on your phone. But just like we\u2019ve seen in the past, other Galaxy AI features are going to tap into the cloud for a little extra help.\nHere are just a few of the Galaxy AI features you\u2019ll find in each of those categories.\nOn-device you\u2019ll find things like AI Select, Writing Assist, Call Summary, Read Aloud, and this pair of \u201cNow\u201d tools:\n- Now Brief: Remember Google Now back in the day? Google\u2019s old service could offer you a summary of your day. Samsung\u2019s Now Brief feels a lot like a modern reincarnation of this tool, keeping you updated throughout the day with information it thinks you\u2019ll find useful.\n- Now Bar: You can think of the Now Bar as a companion to Now Brief, bringing you that same kind of daily content but condensed down into a bite-sized chunk that lives at the bottom of your lock screen.\nCloud-based functionality includes Draw Assist, Sticker Generation, and some Google stuff like Gemini Live and one recently enhanced favorite:\n- Circle to Search: This Google-created feature gets an upgrade with the launch of the Galaxy S25, as AI Overviews come to Circle to Search. Google was already leaning hard on AI to recognize the on-screen elements you\u2019re trying to search, and this expands that usage to also quickly give you a summary of the best information it was able to find. Other tweaks include recognizing phone numbers and URLs.\n- Draw Assist: Galaxy AI uses a combination of text you write, images you upload, or just a quick sketch you throw together to help generate synthesized artwork.\nThere are also a number of Galaxy AI features that straddle both sides of this line, with both on-device and cloud support. Just like we\u2019ve seen Samsung do before, the Galaxy S25 series gives you control over which of these AI tools you want active on your device. Especially with cloud-based features, if you\u2019re uncomfortable with the idea of your data being exposed, you can always opt to have your phone just act like they don\u2019t even exist.\nProVisual Engine\nWhile Galaxy AI represents the flashy tools stealing all the spotlight, lots of Samsung fans come back year after year for the company\u2019s reliable camera performance, with a ton of powerful features all wrapped up in the ProVisual Engine banner. With the S25 series, Samsung is only giving those users more of what they love.\nHere are only some of the new capabilities you\u2019ll find from the ProVisual Engine on top of everything Samsung\u2019s bringing back from past generations:\n- 10-bit HDR: We already touched on this one, but making 10-bit the new default bit depth for HDR means that Samsung\u2019s able to squeeze significantly more dynamic range into the photos the Galaxy S25 phones shoot. That should especially be noticeable in low-light conditions, where Samsung really says the S25 shines.\n- Audio Eraser: Like Google\u2019s Audio Magic Eraser, Samsung has implemented its own tool for cleaning up the audio from video recordings. The system identifies the different components making up the sound in your footage, letting you selectively isolate things like voices, music, and crowd noise. Then, you can adjust the levels on all those individually to get the perfect balance.\n- Galaxy Log: Professionals who lean on the flexibility of Samsung\u2019s pro video mode can now access tools for accurate color grading, with the help of exclusive lookup tables.\n- Virtual Aperture: A physically varying aperture allows cameras to instantly change characteristics like depth of field, but smartphones rarely offer such flexibility. With the Galaxy S25, Samsung\u2019s Expert Raw app will try to achieve the next best thing, letting you simulate the same sort of effect during the editing process.\nWhat did we think of the Galaxy S25 series?\nWe reviewed all three Galaxy S25 series phones shortly after their release. Starting with the Galaxy S25 Ultra review, colleague Ryan Haines called it the company\u2019s \u201cmost impressive flagship to date\u201d as well as its \u201cleast exciting Ultra phone ever.\u201d Ryan praised the build quality, battery life, cameras, performance, display, and update policy. However, he also lamented the downgraded S Pen, lack of Qi2 support, the largely AI-based upgrades, the less-than-ergonomic design, and the expensive price.\nMeanwhile, colleague C Scott Brown reviewed the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus. He felt that Samsung forgot about these phones, pointing to the lack of significant camera upgrades, charging/battery upgrades, and design changes. However, Scott also praised the phones for their performance, new Galaxy AI features, premium build quality, and long update policy. He concluded by saying you\u2019re generally better off saving some cash and buying the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus.\nFAQ\nNo, none of the S25 phones include a microSD card slot. This is not something Samsung has offered on the Galaxy S series in years.\nThe Galaxy S25 phones all support Qi-standard wireless charging at 15W. While they will work with a MagSafe charger, they do not include built-in magnets to hold the charger in place. You can add that support, though, with the help of a compatible case.\nWhile these phones are very similar to the last generation, between the new shape for the Ultra and thinner builds all around, you\u2019ll need to pick up a new case.\nAll Galaxy S25 models support a single physical nano-SIM and allow you to install an eSIM profile. While both of those can be present at once, there\u2019s no option for dual physical SIM cards.\nMuch like support for microSD card storage expansion, the analog headphone jack is one blast from the past that you should not count on making a return. If you want to use wired headphones with the Galaxy S25, consider USB-C headphones or pairing them with an adapter.\nThank you for being part of our community.
