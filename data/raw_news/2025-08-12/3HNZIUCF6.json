  "description": "Offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick told media Tuesday that Utah State transfer McCae Hillstead and true freshman Bear Bachmeier received",
  "content": "PROVO \u2014 BYU hasn't named a starting quarterback for the season opener on Aug. 30 against FCS Portland State.\n\nBut the offensive staff may have taken a significant step forward over the weekend.\n\nOffensive coordinator Aaron Roderick told media Tuesday that Utah State transfer McCae Hillstead and true freshman Bear Bachmeier received \"the majority\" of reps with the first and second team \u2014 at least, for now.\n\nThough he didn't completely eliminate any of the four quarterbacks on the roster from contention for the job, such a move would seemingly leave Treyson Bourguet \u2014 the redshirt junior signal caller from Tucson, Arizona, by way of Western Michigan \u2014 as the odd man out. Coaches have also given backup reps to former Bountiful High star Emerson Geilman.\n\nBut the bulk of time with the \"ones\" and \"twos\" went to Hillstead and Bachmeier, who transferred to BYU with his older brother, Tiger, after going through spring practices at Stanford.\n\n\"As I mentioned Saturday, we can't keep going equal reps with three guys anymore,\" Roderick said. \"Right now, McCae and Bear are getting the majority of the reps with the ones and the twos, and that's where we're at for right now.\"\n\nIn terms of college experience, the decision seems clear. Hillstead started four of the eight games he played in as a true freshman at Utah State, when the former Skyridge High standout threw for 1,062 yards and 11 touchdowns with eight interceptions on a 59.5% clip.\n\nHe became the eighth true freshman to start for the Aggies in school history when he took to the field first against James Madison, a game in which he also set a freshman passing record by completing 25-of-47 passes for 399 yards and four touchdowns with three interceptions.\n\nLike Bourguet, Hillstead spent two years in Provo, sitting behind former quarterback Jake Retzlaff and rehabbing a lower-leg injury that kept him out since his transfer.\n\nBut the 5-foot-10, 195-pound dual-threat signal caller who grew up in Springville before his family moved to Lehi prior to his sophomore season is hardly the only option.\n\nCoaches have continued to be impressed by the upside of Bachmeier, a former four-star quarterback by Rivals from Murrieta, California, who was the No. 6 dual-threat quarterback in the country in 2025 and initially chose the Cardinal over interest from Oregon, Arkansas, Michigan and BYU, among others.\n\nBut after Stanford dismissed former head coach Troy Taylor in March, Bachmeier \u2014 along with his brother, a wide receiver and graduate transfer \u2014 committed to the school where both could contribute.\n\n\"The ability to come in and win games and Roderick's scheme and the pedigree of quarterbacks they have produced in history and recently is enticing,\" Bear Bachmeier told ESPN when he committed.\n\nFor Tiger Bachmeier, that has always meant sooner rather than later after the wide out caught 46 passes for 476 yards and two touchdowns over two seasons while finishing his degree in computer science.\n\nPerhaps it's the same for the younger Bachmeier, whose older brother, Hank, played quarterback at Boise State, Louisiana Tech and Wake Forest.\n\n\"He's making those throws,\" Roderick said of Bear Bachmeier. \"He throws a lot of completions. That's one thing, he doesn't take sacks and he's very accurate.\n\n\"He is throwing a lot of completions out here,\" he added for emphasis.\n\nHead coach Kalani Sitake will ultimately have final say on the starting quarterback, but the decade-long coach of his alma mater won't stand in Roderick's way of the decision, either.\n\n\"I think A-Rod knows where he is going with everything,\" Sitake said. \"The key is, we settled it on the field. I don't control it; it's the players. If you want to win the spot, it's there for the taking. Our job is to put them in position where they can win the spot, and that's for every position including quarterback.\"\n\nNo deadline to name a starter has been established, but both coaches would prefer one is named before kickoff Aug. 30. Sitake said the team, which was leaving for a non-football outing after Tuesday's practice, would transition from training camp to game prep for FCS Portland State a week to 10 days before the season opener.\n\n\"The sooner, the better,\" Roderick said. \"Once it's clear, we'll make the move. As soon as it's clear to us who it is, we'll make that statement.\"",

      "text": "Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes\n- BYU secured former four-star QB Bear Bachmeier from Stanford via transfer portal.\n- Bachmeier, from Murrieta, California, chose BYU for its successful QB development history.\n- He joins BYU's QB roster, including starter Jake Retzlaff, enhancing their offensive lineup.\nPROVO \u2014 BYU has added a quarterback from the transfer portal after all.\nAfter going through spring practices with three quarterbacks \u2014 and a former Utah high school standout on the way \u2014 the Cougars earned a commitment from a former four-star recruit and Stanford freshman transfer Saturday morning.\nBear Bachmeier has committed to Brigham Young, he told ESPN. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound signal caller from Murrieta, California, comes to BYU with all of his eligibility remaining after initially signing with Stanford as part of the 2025 class.\n\"The ability to come in and win games, and offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick's scheme and the pedigree of quarterbacks they have produced in history and recently is enticing,\" Bachmeier told ESPN.\nBachmeier joins a pair of tight end commitments, a former Snow College standout wide receiver, and a defensive tackle from Oklahoma State returning to his home state in committing to BYU during the spring portal window.\nBachmeier, whose older brother, Hank, played at Boise State and Wake Forest, was a highly recruited quarterback out of Murrieta Valley High.\nThe younger Bachmeier was a four-star recruit by On3 and Rivals, and ranked as high as the No. 11 quarterback nationally by ESPN after totaling 6,463 yards with 56 touchdowns and 30 more rushing scores in his high school career.\nFormer Stanford QB Bear Bachmeier has committed to BYU, he tells ESPN. Bachmeier visited the last few days and committed on Saturday morning. pic.twitter.com/nm6WXVuRqx\n\u2014 Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) May 3, 2025\nBYU recruited him \u2014 as did Georgia, Oregon, Notre Dame, Alabama, Colorado, Miami and others \u2014 before Bachmeier ultimately committed to Stanford and joined his older brother Tiger at Stanford.\nBut when Stanford fired coach Troy Taylor and brought in interim coach Frank Reich, the duo both put their names in the transfer portal. The two aren't necessarily considered a package deal for their next stop.\nStill, both visited BYU this weekend, with Bear Bachmeier \u2014 noticeably quiet on social media \u2014 even posting a photo on his X account from LaVell Edwards Stadium.\nA few hours later, Tiger Bachmeier also committed to the Cougars, he told ESPN later Saturday evening, after graduating from Stanford with a degree in computer science in two-and-a-half years.\nThe 6-foot-1, 190-pound pass catcher was Stanford's primary kickoff and punt returner as a sophomore, when he also caught 10 passes for 67 yards on offense. Tiger Bachmeier was the Cardinal's outstanding freshman in 2023, when he started seven of 12 games and led the Pac-12 in receptions and receiving yards by a true freshman with 36 catches for 409 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\nBy the end of the day, the Cougars nabbed a commitment from two Bachmeiers: one who fills in immediate need following the departure of wide receiver and All-American kick returner Keelan Marion, and his former four-star quarterback brother who joins incumbent starter Jake Retzlaff, a fifth-year senior, and backups McCae Hillstead and Treyson Bourguet in the quarterback room.\nRetzlaff, of course, is the unquestioned leader of the group as a returning starter who completed 57.9% of his passes for 2,947 yards and 20 touchdowns with 12 interceptions and another six rushing scores during the Cougars' 11-2 campaign that finished with a No. 13 national ranking. Beyond that, there has been \u2014 and will continue to be \u2014 competition, as Roderick noted at the conclusion of spring ball.\n\"We really like our team right now, and we're not desperate to go find somebody; there's no 'position of need' where we have to have somebody right now,\" Roderick said at the close of spring practices. \"But we'll never turn away a player that we think can make a difference. We're open to players that make us better.\"\nFormer Bountiful standout Emerson Geilman is expected to join the Cougars in the fall prior to serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nHillstead, a 5-foot-10 former standout at nearby Skyridge High in Lehi who started portions of his freshman season at Utah State, will be a redshirt sophomore in the fall. Bourguet, a 6-foot-2 Tucson native who transferred from Western Michigan, will be a redshirt junior.\n\"I think we could win a game with either one of them; I don't know which one that would be yet,\" Roderick said of the backups. \"They've both had more good days than bad, and I think they're both good players.\""

      "text": "Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes\n- BYU's QB competition remains open with McCae Hillstead, Treyson Bourguet, and Bear Bachmeier.\n- Coach Aaron Roderick plans to soon establish a pecking order for more reps.\n- Defense is ahead in training camp; offense shows promise in run game development.\nPROVO \u2014 Aaron Roderick called his BYU offense \"sloppy\" after Saturday's first scrimmage of training camp at LaVell Edwards Stadium that capped the second week.\nBut three weeks before the Cougars open the 2025 season Aug. 30 against FCS Portland State, defensive coordinator Jay Hill wasn't taking a victory lap, either.\nBoth coordinators and head coach Kalani Sitake admitted to reporters that the defense was ahead of the offense after nearly two weeks of camp, including the last five days or so of fully padded work. Sitake said the Cougars went through more than 100 reps, many of them live, as well as some special teams work during the closed-door scrimmage.\nNone of those reps included an interception from the three quarterback race of McCae Hillstead, Treyson Bourguet and true freshman Bear Bachmeier, who all received an equal share of work with the first-team offense. True freshman Emerson Geilman also saw some time at quarterback.\nBut that may change soon, Roderick noted. He didn't name a starter when all three coaches met with the media via video conference Saturday afternoon, but he appeared anxious to move along the competition for arguably the offense's most important position.\n\"It's not going to be keeping equal reps forever,\" Roderick said. \"There's going to be a point pretty soon \u2014 I'm not ready to say exactly when \u2014 where we are going to have to start establishing a pecking order and getting somebody more reps with the ones and twos.\n\"If we keep going the way we're going forever, then nobody will be ready to play in our first game,\" he added. \"That move will be happening soon.\"\nThat the defense took the early edge in training camp should be expected, though Hill said he has plenty of question marks to sort out as he enters the third year overseeing the Cougars' defense. First and foremost is defensive line, where Utah transfer Keanu Tanuvasa, Southern Utah's Anisi Purcell and senior John Taumoepeau excelled while Oklahoma State transfer Justin Kirkland continues to make progress in a return from injury.\nSitake acknowledged that \"guys got banged up today\" as the team moves into more live work, and Hill acknowledged cornerback Tre Alexander \"dinged up his shoulder\" \u2014 though that injury isn't expected to keep him out for long. The 6-foot-2, 175-pound sophomore from the Atlanta area is one of the top-three cornerbacks along with Evan Johnson and Mory Bamba \u2014 the former junior college transfer who will enter his fourth season at BYU in the fall and has been cleared to play.\nHill has seen \"flashes\" of Pine View alum Marcus McKenzie and Jonathan Kabeya from Euless, Texas, since the spring. But ...\n\"We need someone to step up in that room,\" he added.\nThe defensive shuffling is going on under the microscope of a quarterback competition on the other side of the line of scrimmage, escalated by the introduction of full pads in the past week. That can be a fine line to balance \u2014 Hill said he wants to encourage his edges to rush the passer and his defensive backs to go for picks.\nBut there's also value in the offense figuring itself out, obviously.\n\"Today we needed to tackle,\" Hill quipped. \"A-Rod had guys who needed to get hit, and I had some guys who needed to hit.\"\nMost of what Roderick described as \"sloppy\" play came from offensive penalties and issues that involved playing on a full-sized field with a complete officiating crew. Less of an issue? The run game, led by returning tailbacks LJ Martin and Sione Moa and an offensive line anchored by Andrew Gentry and Isaiah Jatta with a tight end in UCLA and Utah transfer Carsen Ryan who can \"play every down, run or pass.\"\n\"Our run game is going to be really good,\" said Roderick, who said the Cougars are still waiting on an NCAA appeal for another year of eligibility for Hinckley Ropati. \"We're going to be able to run the football.\"\nAdded Sitake: \"Part of our identity will be how our offense responds to today. It wasn't a horrible day for them, but it was a really good defensive day.\n\"They didn't win every rep, but they did play really, really good,\" he said. \"If they play at that level, I'll feel really good about it.\""

      "text": "- Jake Retzlaff plans to transfer from BYU, informing teammates and staff.\n- Retzlaff faces a civil lawsuit alleging sexual assault, which he denies.\n- BYU, aware of the lawsuit, adheres to privacy laws and won't comment further.\nPROVO \u2014 Jake Retzlaff has seemed to have played his final snaps in a BYU uniform.\nThe rising fifth-year senior quarterback began informing players and coaching staff members of his plans to transfer, ESPN reported Sunday.\nRetzlaff, who played two seasons in Provo \u2014 including a four-game redshirt campaign after transferring from two years in the California junior college system \u2014 had been the subject of a civil lawsuit filed by a Salt Lake woman who alleged the quarterback committed sexual assault after she was invited to his apartment to play video games.\nThe Corona, California, native who was widely promoted as BYU's first-ever Jewish stating quarterback filed a response to the allegations Friday in Utah's 3rd District Court, saying the sexual encounter was consensual and refuting \"each and every allegation contained\" in the initial lawsuit.\nBut Retzlaff was living under the school's honor code, which among other things prohibits premarital sex for all its students. Previous instances of transgressions against the school's honor code had led to multi-game suspensions for athletes.\nSources: BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff plans to transfer from the school and has begun informing the staff and players of his plan to leave. He'd been facing an Honor Code suspension tied to a civil suit that alleges he raped a woman. pic.twitter.com/YO5ZfooLCf\n\u2014 Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) June 29, 2025\nThe most high-profile suspension came in 2011, when former star power forward Brandon Davies was suspended by the university after having consensual sex with his then-girlfriend. Since then, a number of reforms have been made to the honor code enforcement, including a provision that kept the university from speaking of the infractions publicly.\nIn a response to the original lawsuit, BYU said it was made aware of the civil lawsuit the morning before it was filed and released to the media. The university has not commented on the case since May 21.\n\"The university takes any allegation very seriously, following all processes and guidelines mandated by Title IX,\" the statement included. \"Due to federal and university privacy laws and practices for students, the university will not be able to provide additional comment.\"\nRetzlaff graduated in April with a degree in exercise and wellness, and was set to be one of several key returners on a BYU team that finished the season with an 11-2 record and the No. 13 ranking in the final Associated Press Top 25.\nThe 6-foot-1 dual-threat signal caller threw for 2,947 yards and 20 touchdowns with 12 interceptions as a redshirt junior a year ago, when he also ran for 417 yards and six scores.\nBackup quarterbacks behind Retzlaff include former Utah State starter McCae Hillstead, a redshirt-sophomore who prepped at Skyridge High; redshirt junior Treyson Bourguet, a Tucson native who transferred from Western Michigan; and former four-star recruit Bear Bachmeier from Murrieta, California, who threw 6,810 yards and 59 touchdowns in a high-profile career at Murrieta Valley High before signing with Stanford.\nThe 6-foot-2 incoming freshman transferred to BYU with older brother, Tiger, a standout wide receiver, after spring practices."

He is a class of 2025 recruit who committed to Stanford out of high school and enrolled there this spring.\nBoth Bachmeiers elected to transfer in the wake of Stanford's dismissal of head coach Troy Taylor in March. After visiting BYU coach Kalani Sitake's program in recent days, the brothers committed.\nFor Bear, he is expected to be one of the backups for successful incumbent quarterback Jake Retzlaff in 2025 and compete for the starting job at BYU in 2026.\nBear was attracted to BYU's open offensive scheme and a rich history of quarterbacks that includes a strong recent run under offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick. He also referenced BYU's historical success, which stretches from Jim McMahon to Ty Detmer to Steve Young.\n\"The ability to come in and win games and [Coach] Roderick's scheme and the pedigree of quarterbacks they have produced in history and recently is enticing,\" Bear told ESPN.\nTiger told ESPN he committed to BYU later Saturday.

      "text": "Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes\n- BYU quarterback Treyson Bourguet is a Tucson native, but is now preparing for a unique match against Arizona.\n- Once committed to the Wildcats, Treyson emphasizes treating the game like any other, expressing contentment with his current role at BYU.\n- Saturday's game is the 26th all-time meeting between the Cougars and Wildcats, with the series tied 12-12-1.\nPROVO \u2014 One of the top football families in Tucson will make the trip to LaVell Edwards Stadium when the University of Arizona plays BYU this Saturday afternoon (2 p.m. MDT, FOX), but don't expect \"Bear Down\" to be in their vocabulary during \"Big Noon Kickoff.\"\nThat's because it's the family of BYU reserve quarterback Treyson Bourguet, whose parents Toby and Vanessa and younger sister Rylen will be on hand to support him like they have since he transferred to BYU from Western Michigan.\nFootball is what the family does.\nTreyson Bourguet is the third of four children in the Bourguet household \u2014 Treyson because he's the third son behind older brothers Trenton and Coben, who both play at Arizona State. But the younger Bourguet carved his own path in the MAC before moving closer to home to play for head coach Kalani Sitake.\nWhen asked by KSL.com earlier this week if that led to any extra feelings about playing the school that the Salpointe Catholic graduate grew up cheering on, Bourguet admitted it was a bit \"surreal\" to see the Wildcats on BYU's Big 12 schedule.\n\"Growing up, you always imagined yourself playing for your hometown team, which for me was Arizona,\" he said. \"I actually committed to Arizona under coach (Kevin) Sumlin; things didn't work out, but I'm right where I'm supposed to be at BYU. This is home.\n\"So I just treat this game like any other game. I know we're playing my hometown (school), but it's just another game for us.\"\nBourguet fell in love with the sport from the time he was 5-6 years old, when he would join his older brothers in the backyard and play for hours. That love for football likely came from dad Toby, whom Treyson Bourguet recalls staying up late on a school night to watch in flag football tournaments.\nThe younger Bourguet even played at halftime of the NFL's Pro Bowl when he was 14 as a part of Flag Football Nationals. But when it comes to flag football, where more than 700,000 players play in over 1,800 leagues in all 50 states per NFL Flag, another Bourguet outshines the rest.\nThat would be baby sister Rylen, a seven-time state champion in volleyball, soccer and beach volleyball \u2014 who earned a scholarship to play beach at Arizona State.\nBut when the LA organizing committee announced that flag football would be part of the Olympic program as a host event in 2028, she made the tough decision to withdraw and focus on competing internationally in the sport, per KVOA television in Tucson.\n\"She just fell in love with flag football \u2026 and she's been grinding,\" Bourguet said of Rylen, who was named to the USA Football U20 Select team this past summer. \"She works out probably three times a day, seven days a week. She's coming (to Provo) for the game this week, but she's already had me hook her up with a couple of trainers out here. She's just a grinder who loves to compete and work, and I'm really excited for her bright future.\"\nBYU has 11 players on the football roster for 2024-25 from Arizona, a state that has proven fertile recruiting ground due to a large concentration of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who regularly trade winters in Provo for summers in Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler and Mesa.\nOne of the Wildcats' biggest recruiting challengers historically has been BYU.\n\"Honestly, I think they get most of the high school talent from Arizona. They probably have done a better job of recruiting Arizona guys than ASU has,\" said BYU safety Tommy Prassas, a Basha High alum from Chandler who grew up an Arizona State fan. \"It's mostly homegrown Arizona boys, and they've always had a solid team. They had a great coaching staff last year, and got another good one this year.\"\nBourguet is one of two players on BYU's roster from Tucson alongside sophomore safety Chika Ebunoha. Both of them admitted circling Saturday's matchup against the Wildcats when their Big 12 schedule was released in the spring.\n\"My family and friends have been nothing but supportive since I came out there. I know they've got my back,\" said Ebunoha, who has played in three games in 2024 at cornerback and special teams. \"But I know it's going to be fun.\"\nWhile they'll both be representing their hometown in BYU colors when they run out of the tunnel Saturday afternoon at LaVell Edwards Stadium, they \u2014 and their families \u2014 are happy to represent the school that has welcomed them with open arms, too.\n\"I know a lot of people from my hometown will be keeping up with it,\" said Ebunoha, whose first name Chikaodinaka means \"In God's hands\" in the native language of his parents' home land of Nigeria. \"But like any other game, I'm just excited to play in (LaVell Edwards Stadium) and to feel the atmosphere.\"\nHow to watch, stream and listen\nNo. 14 BYU (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) vs. Arizona (3-2, 2-1 Big 12)\nSaturday, Oct. 12\n- Kickoff: 2 p.m. MDT\n- TV: FOX (Gus Johnson, Joel Klatt, Jenny Taft)\n- Streaming: FoxSports.com\n- Radio: BYUradio SiriusXM 143, KSL 1160AM/102.7FM (Greg Wrubell, Hans Olsen, Mitchell Juergens)\n- Series: Tied, 12-12-1\n- Big Noon Kickoff.

      "text": "Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes\n- Emerson Geilman, a state champion quarterback, signed with BYU, his dream school.\n- Geilman improved significantly from junior to senior year, attracting BYU's attention.\n- He values BYU's culture and coaches, despite interest from Utah State and Bronco Mendenhall.\nBOUNTIFUL \u2014 Have you ever been so emotionally involved with a BYU sporting result that you shed tears?\nDid you ever seriously put all your hopes and dreams into playing for the Cougars when you were in grade school?\nWell, you then hold something in common with BYU's most recent quarterback signee.\nEmerson Geilman, a 6-foot-3, 193-pound state champion quarterback from Bountiful who signed with the Cougars in February, is a true dual-threat signal-caller. Geilman threw for 2,476 yards last season with 24 touchdowns against just four interceptions while rushing for another 793 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nAnd he bleeds blue, through and through.\n\"BYU's been my dream school since I was little. I'm so humbled to be able to go there,\" Geilman told Ben Criddle in an interview on ESPN the FAN. \"It's always been my dream school and I'd cry all the time when they lost when I was little.\"\nAs for holding the dream of playing for BYU ever since he was young, Geilman provided proof. And while most of our dreams of doing as much are just that \u2014 dreams \u2014 Geilman has advanced to the point where his adolescent dream has now become a reality.\nSuch connections to a program can be drawn easily through one's upbringing, and Geilman very much grew up in a royal blue household.\n\"Both of my parents went to BYU, and I love what the university stands for,\" Geilman said. \"I love the culture and the coaching staff, especially, is amazing.\"\nBetter late than never\nIn order to receive a football scholarship, one usually has to validate their play and potential prior to their senior season \u2014 particularly quarterbacks. But some athletes experience tremendous growth from their junior to senior seasons, which is often too late in the recruiting cycle to receive a quality offer.\nCount Geilman as one of those players who saw improvements to his game, which BYU coaches first noticed during summer camp in June. He then validated what he showed in camp throughout his MVP senior season, and then some.\n\"They really like the development from junior to senior year,\" Geilman said. \"Junior year was my first year starting and I threw a lot of interceptions. It wasn't a really good year, but there was a lot of growth from my junior to senior year and I really, really worked hard on the weaknesses of my game.\"\nBYU wasn't alone in noticing Geilman's improvements, with Utah State also coming forward with an offer \u2014 an option he weighed heavily considering his trust and admiration for new Aggies coach Bronco Mendenhall, among other factors.\n\"BYU was the place where I wanted to play, but I also have a very high opinion of Bronco Mendenhall,\" Geilman said. \"Playing for him would also be a privilege \u2026 but at the end of the day BYU has been my dream.\"\nBeyond the dream\nFortunately for Geilman, and for BYU, the football program presents a ripe opportunity with regards to development and competitive play from his point of view.\n\"Some special stuff is going on right now in Provo, and I'm excited to be a part of it. ... You can tell there's a lot of hunger,\" Geilman said. \"I think BYU gets disrespected a lot by polls and some national commentators, and I think there's a big chip on player's shoulders to prove those people wrong and to have another big year.\"\nGeilman also believes his development both on and off the field will be in good hands with offensive coaches such as offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick and offensive analyst Matt Mitchell, among others.\n\"First of all, they're just such genuine dudes and they really are great men. \u2026 I really want to learn from them beyond the game of football,\" Geilman said. \"But from a football standpoint, I really like their scheme and I love the blend of play-action and using the QB in the run game.\"\nGeliman, who carries a 34 ACT score and 4.0 GPA, worked out his senior year schedule so that he be in Provo at noon every weekday. While there, he attends team meetings and observes practice sessions in an effort to hit the ground running when he enters the program this coming fall.\nWhen he gets to Provo, he'll join a relatively sparse but talented quarterback room consisting of senior Jake Retzlaff, junior Treyson Bourget and sophomore McCae Hillstead \u2014 all of whom he's excited to learn from before embarking on his planned mission service for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints following the 2025 football season."

  "argos_summary": "BYU's quarterback competition remains open as the team prepares for the season opener against Portland State on August 30. Offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick indicated that McCae Hillstead and true freshman Bear Bachmeier are currently receiving the majority of first-team reps, while redshirt junior Treyson Bourguet may be falling behind. The Cougars recently added Bear and his brother Tiger Bachmeier from Stanford, enhancing their roster as they look to solidify their starting quarterback position before the season begins.",
