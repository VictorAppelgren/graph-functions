  "description": "The directive is a response to critical grid security concerns in the Midwestern region.",
  "content": "The US Department of Energy has extended an emergency order to maintain the availability of the JHCampbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, from 21 August 2025 to 19 November 2025.\n\nThe directive to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) is a response to critical grid security concerns and power outage risks in the Midwestern region of the country.\n\nSince the Department of Energy's initial order on 23 May, the Campbell plant has been integral to MISO's ability to meet high energy demands, especially during times when intermittent energy production is low.\n\nThe emergency conditions necessitating the original order are still present, reinforcing the need for the Campbell plant's continued operation.\n\nThe plant was set to close on 31 May, 15 years before the end of its projected design life.\n\nUS Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stated: \u201cThe US continues to face an energy emergency, with some regions experiencing more capacity constraints than others. With electricity demand increasing, we must put an end to the dangerous energy subtraction policies embraced by politicians for too long.\n\n\u201cThis order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Energy's Grid Reliability Evaluation warns of a potential 100-fold increase in power outages by 2030 if the US continues to decommission reliable power sources.\n\nThe urgency of the situation is further underscored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) latest seasonal outlook, which predicts a significant chance of above-normal temperatures in the Midwest during summer 2025.\n\nThese conditions are likely to increase energy demand, placing additional strain on the grid.\n\n\"US Energy Secretary directs MISO to keep Michigan coal plant operational\" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\n\n The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.
