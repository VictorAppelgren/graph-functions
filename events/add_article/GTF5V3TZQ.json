      "summary": "The British pound and Japanese yen fell amid renewed worries over global fiscal deficits and political uncertainty in Japan.  Rising 30‑year gilt yields pushed sterling down more than 1%, while the yen slipped after a key Japanese political figure signaled resignation.  The dollar gained on the back of these moves, and other currencies such as the euro and Australian dollar saw modest declines as investors turned to safe‑haven assets.",
