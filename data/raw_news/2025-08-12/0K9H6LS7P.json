  "title": "Assassin's Creed has gone a bit off the rails, but Ubisoft says it hasn't forgotten about the whole Assassins versus Templars thing, with a \"deep dive\" on the conflict coming \"in the near future\"",
  "description": "Now eventually you do plan to have Templars in your Assassins versus Templars game, right?",
  "content": "The Assassin's Creed series tends to have a flaky relationship with its own lore, as you can never be quite sure whether theoretical mainstays like modern-day shenanigans or Isu artifacts are going to appear in any given entry. Even the conflict between the Assassins and the Templars was more or less swept under the rug in Assassin's Creed Shadows, but Ubisoft is hinting that may soon change.\n\n\"The Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of Assassin's Creed,\" a developer identified as Luc says in a Reddit AMA. \"With Shadows, we wanted to properly set our protagonist in the setting before expanding on the Assassins vs. Templars. Now that it's done on the main game, we scratched the surface with the Critical Role story drop, and you can expect more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.\"\n\nShadows does technically feature a handful of Templars, but the organization is very much in the distant background of the game's main conflict. Luc's comment doesn't make clear when we'll see the return of the full Templar storyline, but the Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap currently only has a single major story DLC release on it \u2013 I'd say that free Claws of Awaji expansion is a pretty safe bet for some Templar action.\n\nAnd yes, the Critical Role story drop Luc alludes to is indeed canon, though the Dead by Daylight crossover is not. Luc confirms as much in another comment, where the issue of Isu artifacts is also addressed. \"The fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of Shadows doesn't mean that it doesn't exist in the world of Shadows; it just wasn't a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell,\" Luc says.\n\nWhat about a return to the modern-day storyline? \"While Modern Day is not the main focus of the story we tell with Shadows,\" Luc says in yet another comment, \"it remains important for our community, so you can expect it to be expanded at some point, in some fashion\u2026\"\n\nOn the topic of both the Templars and the Isu, another dev identified as Simon notes that any specific details \"would be a spoiler,\" but says to \"keep an eye on our future updates \u2013 there might be more deep-lore secrets drops than you imagine\u2026\"\n\nThat's a whole lot of \"someday\" and \"maybe\" with regards to the central lore of Assassin's Creed, but it does at least sound like we can expect a big check-in with the Templars sooner rather than later. As an unapologetic enthusiast for the series' ancient aliens and bizarre sci-fi plot twists, I hope those \"deep-lore secrets\" are indeed bigger than I imagine.\n\nHere are all the upcoming Ubisoft games you need to know about.",

      "text": "Ubisoft unveils \"updated\" Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap with New Game+ and level cap boost, again vindicating my plan to wait months if not years to play new Ubisoft games\nThe Claws of Awaji DLC also has a fresh September release date\nUbisoft has revealed an \"updated\" Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap detailing what's to come for the open-world RPG this summer and beyond.\n\"This summer, it's all about progression,\" Ubisoft says on its official website.\nKicking things off next week, Assassin's Creed Shadows is officially getting its New Game+ mode on July 29. The mode will be available once you beat the main story and the credits roll, resetting your progression and discovered locations but letting you keep your character level, gear, skill points, Knowledge rank, and Hideout progression.\nNew Game+ will also give you the option to skip the game's prologue entirely, and you won't be bothered by any of the tutorial sections that were there in your first playthrough.\nAlso on July 29, Assassin's Creed Shadows is getting its first level cap increase, from 60 to 80 for all players regardless of whether they're playing New Game+ or not. The \"Progression Update\" will also add new Knowledge Ranks, Mastery and Knowledge Skill ranks, and new upgrades for all Hideout buildings.\nThe July 29 update will also add the new Project 3 to the Animus menu, bringing along new resources, data files, and exclusive Animus-themed rewards.\nComing at the beginning of September, the game's newly revealed \"quality-of-life improvement update\" will add \"some of the most requested features from our community\" since launch. This update will let you skip time of day from dusk 'til dawn and vice-versa, and it'll unfog the map when you do a viewpoint synchronization. It'll also uncap the frame rate on PC, add some upgrades to the Hideout, add the new Mythic and Artifact upgrade levels to Forge, and add \"additional goodies that may be familiar to long-time series fans.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nFinally, there's no more guessing as to when the game's first expansions, Claws of Awaji, is coming out. Ubisoft has officially set a September 16 release date for the DLC, free for everyone who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows.\nBy no means is this sort of thing unique to Ubisoft games, but boy am I feeling mighty vindicated in my decision to hold off on playing Assassin's Creed Shadows at launch. It wasn't easy; a AAA open-world game set in feudal Japan is very much my jam; but I feel like a lot of these post-launch features could've, and maybe should've, been there day one. Or, maybe, that's just what I tell myself when I know I have a dozen great games in my backlog and simply don't have time for another 60-hour game.\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side. I got my big break here in 2019 with a freelance news gig, and I was hired on as GamesRadar's west coast Staff Writer in 2021. That means I'm responsible for managing the site's western regional executive branch, AKA my home office, and writing about whatever horror game I'm too afraid to finish.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Upcoming Ubisoft games: Every new Ubisoft game in development\nThere are plenty of upcoming Ubisoft games in the works now that Assassin's Creed Shadows has launched, and we finally have at least one release date\nQuite a lot of upcoming Ubisoft games have been confirmed so far, with the publisher and developer revealing various new games in the works that are set to come in 2025 and beyond. Among these is Anno 117: Pax Romana, which finally got a November release date for later in 2025 as part of the Summer Game Fest 2025 festivities.\nLooking back, it's been a busy time for the studio of late, with the latest release, Assassin's Creed Shadows, landing in March this year - which came after Star Wars Outlaws, another major Ubisoft game that launched back in 2024. But with past announcements of various upcoming Assassin's Creed games, as well as future releases that were revealed quite some time ago, such as Beyond Good and Evil 2, there's still plenty on the docket - although many have yet to get concrete release dates.\nRecent news has also confirmed Tencent has invested in a Ubisoft subsidiary that will spearhead development on new Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six games. There's more we still need to learn about this new partnership, but for now, here's everything we know about the upcoming Ubisoft games lined up for 2025 and beyond.\nAll the upcoming Ubisoft games we know about\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: 2025\nAnno 117: Pax Romana\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X, PS5\nRelease date: November 13, 2025\nAiming to deliver a \"Roman gaming experience unlike anything else\", Anno 117: Pax Romana is coming in November. We'll be going way back in time to the golden age of the Roman empire come 2025 for what's sure to be a return to the series' unique blend of detailed RTS and city-building gameplay. Check out our list of the best RTS games of all time while you wait for this winter's latest!\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: TBC 2025\nAssassin's Creed Jade\nPlatforms: iOS, Android\nRelease Date: TBC 2025\nA beloved franchise is getting the mobile treatment in Assassin's Creed Jade. It's set in ancient China, and save for the initial announcement trailer and confirmation of its title being simply Assassin's Creed Jade (having been previously referred to as codename Jade), details on this one are still a little sparse - aside from a brief hands-on back in 2023.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWe do know that Jade will be a mobile-exclusive, open world game. With free reign of iconic landmark locations, Assassin's Creed executive director Marc-Alexis C\u00f4t\u00e9 says we will be able to \"parkour atop the Great Wall of China, sneak through bustling cities, engage in intense combat, and discover the secrets, the vastness, of ancient China.\"\nTom Clancy's The Division Resurgence\nPlatforms: Apple, Android\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nMobile-only The Division Resurgence has all the open-world gunslinging of the original title, only this time, it's all in the palm of your hand. It's going the free-to-play avenue, much like The Division Heartland, and although there's no global rollout confirmed, it's already being released in Southeast Asia under a different publisher.\nFollowing The Division Resurgence playtest signups, we got an update during the Ubisoft Forward 2023, which confirmed we could have expected to see Resurgence in fall 2024. However, this was further delayed to 2025. So, we're still waiting to hear any new release date news.\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: 2026\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake\nPlatforms: TBC\nRelease date: TBC 2026\nThe Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is one of the most mysterious upcoming Ubisoft games on the list. This \"heavily under wraps\" remake of a classic entry in the action-adventure series is now being developed by Ubisoft Montreal, much like the original \u2013 and despite the sparse information at hand, an update from Ubisoft confirms that the project is \"very much alive\".\nWe know that it's only just officially entered development following a restart in 2023, and with a ballpark release window of 2026, it'll be quite some time before we get to see the 2003 original remade for modern consoles.\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: TBC\nAssassin's Creed Codename Hexe\nPlatforms: TBC\nRelease date: TBC\nSomething wicked this way comes? Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe is perhaps the most mysterious upcoming Ubisoft game of them all, purely for the fact that its short teaser trailer gives up next to nothing. All we can see from it is a handmade talisman, resembling the Assassin's insignia, dangling against the backdrop of a dark forest.\nUbisoft has only gone so far as to describe Hexe as \"a very different Assassin's Creed game,\" with speculating fans pointing to hints that Hexe might be set during the German witch trials. This seems entirely plausible, especially given the Pagan connotations of the talisman, so we can't help but get excited for a darker and somewhat spookier AC experience.\nBeyond Good and Evil 2\nPlatforms: TBC\nRelease date: TBC\nFirst hinted at in 2008, Beyond Good and Evil 2 has become synonymous with developmental hell. It's been six years since Ubisoft officially announced it during E3 2017, and with just a few promo shots and press releases to on on since then, it's anyone's guess whether we can expect news anytime soon. What we do know is that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is intended as a prequel to the 2003 original, this time featuring more open-world RPG gameplay, branching narratives, and the choice between playing solo or multiplayer modes.\nProject U\nPlatforms: TBC\nRelease date: TBC\nFor a game that's already had one closed beta test, there's precious little online about Project U. According to the Ubisoft website, Project U is a \"new concept of session-based co-op shooter, where many players unite to prevail against an overwhelming threat.\" This isn't the first time the publisher has hazarded a go at a co-op looter-shooter, though, with the cancellation of Project Q back in 2023, sending its crew to work on Assassin's Creed Mirage instead.\nSplinter Cell remake\nPlatforms: TBC\nRelease date: TBC\nOne upcoming Ubisoft game we would love to get a closer look at is the Splinter Cell remake, which went into development in 2021. With Ubisoft Toronto at the helm, the studio is keen to \"make sure the spirit of the early games remains intact\" \u2013 that means we'll hopefully see the stealth-heavy action gameplay we remember from the 2002 original. It's apparently possible to get through the whole game without a single kill, too, but we'll believe it when we see some gameplay.\nTom Clancy's The Division 3\nPlatforms: TBC\nRelease date: TBC\nThis one is probably in its most embryonic stages of pre-production planning, but Ubisoft has casually let slip that Tom Clancy's The Division 3 is in the works. We don't know much else about it just yet, save that it'll be developed by Massive Entertainment and spearheaded by Julian Gerighty as executive producer of the whole Tom Clancy brand (via Twitter).\nSince he just finished directing Star Wars Outlaws, though, we don't expect to see the third Division game (or hear much more about it) for a while. To be honest, the earliest time we can expect an update is likely in mid-2025. In the meantime, if you are curious about Gerighty's latest big Ubisoft game, you can read our Star Wars Outlaws review.\nCheck out the biggest upcoming PS5 games for more hot new releases.

      "text": "Assassin's Creed Shadows update adds nightmare difficulty, an \"open-world alarm\" system,\" a potato mode for low-end PCs, and a new story quest crossing over with D&D series Critical Role\nAnother AC Shadows collaboration is here\nUbisoft's post-launch support for Assassin's Creed Shadows continues apace with another chunky update arriving on June 25. The publisher has just revealed the full patch notes for Title Update 1.0.6, with upgrades ranging from a new high-end difficulty setting to a free bit of story DLC crossing over with long-running D&D web series Critical Role.\nThe update launches June 25 at 7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST, as Ubisoft details in a new Steam blog, and depending on your platform of choice you might wanna budget a little extra time to download it. On PS5, the update is 6.27GB, and that size grows progressively bigger through various PC versions up to the Xbox Series X/S edition at a whopping 19GB.\nSome chunk of that download will be dedicated to a new crossover story quest called A Critical Encounter, where you'll meet Robbie Daymond's character Rufino from Critical Role's Assassin's Creed Shadows one-shot. Daymond will voice the character himself in Shadows, adding a little extra authenticity to the collab. Shadows' earlier crossover with Dead by Daylight seemed to be broadly well received, so here's hoping the Critical Role crossover is of similar quality.\nThe other headline addition here is the new nightmare difficulty setting, which sounds like it's living up to the billing. Enemies deal more damage, parry timing is far narrower, and \"enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances.\" The difficulty boost applies to stealth, too, and you'll now be in danger of being heard even while crouching as Naoe.\nThere are a bunch of other nice little changes, including the option to show - not hide - your headgear in cutscenes, and alter visual effects like parry indicators and the like to customize what gets overlaid in-game. The biggest gameplay change is a new open-world alarm system, which will put you at risk of triggering a regional alert for \"repetitively attacking Civilians or Military units outside Castles.\"\nAnd one more extra bonus for PC players trying to make this open-world opus work on potato-level rigs: an ultra-low spec mode. \"This will allow PC players with a limited GPU configuration to experience the game in better framerate conditions,\" Ubisoft explains. Shadows is likely still going to be very demanding at a CPU level, but at least you'll be able to squeeze out a few more frames if you're rocking an older graphics card.\nSneak into our list of the best Assassin's Creed games.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

It, like its predecessors, takes inspiration from a real time and place to create a fantastical playground for us to slit throats in. But this time around, there won't be an educational Discovery Tour.\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla, Origins, and Odyssey all had Discover Tours. These are separate digital downloads that you can get as a standalone product or play within their respective games.\nTheir aim is to shed more light on the settings of the games, like an interactive history lesson. They're a great way to integrate video games into the classroom and help kids take an interest in history.\nComment from r/assassinscreed\nThey're also not the only way the series has tried to give back. When the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris burned down, Ubisoft gave away copies of Assassin's Creed Unity so people could see what it looked like in its former glory, and apparently scans the developers took were used to help restore the old building.\nIn a recent Reddit AMA, one player asked if Shadows, set in Japan's Sengoku period, would have a Discovery Tour. An Ubisoft account replied, \"On Shadows, we have decided to integrate the Historical Codex directly in the main game so it's available to everyone.\n\"So compared to games like Odyssey or Valhalla, all players can access that historical information directly in the main game. But to get to the core of your question, we do not currently have a 'Japan Discovery Tour' like we had for 'Viking Age' in the works.\"\nSorry, teachers, I guess that means you're going to have to play the game itself and try not to let the kids see you spilling any blood if you want to use Shadows to teach them about Japan.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWhile you're here, check out our ranking of the best Assassin's Creed games.

These free updates will also be packed with new activities and features, as well as improvements to existing aspects of the game.\nHere are all the updates Ubisoft has announced so far and when they\u2019ll release for the Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows roadmap:\nEarly May\n- First Story Drop, \u201cThe Works of Luis Frois\u201d: A free update focused on learning more about the Jesuit scholar Luis Frois, who appears at various points in the main story, notably right at the beginning when Yasuke (then Diogo) is acting as a bodyguard.\n- Codex update\n- Quality-of-life improvements\nLate May\n- First Special Collaboration: Who this collaboration is with has not yet been announced.\n- Parkour update: New height-gaining back-ejects, newly animated height-gaining side-ejects and an entirely new vertical ledge jump move.

It will release \"later in 2025\" and is free to all players that pre-ordered Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows, but there is still no way to buy it separately for when it launches.\nNaoe and Yasuke must reclaim a lost treasure while avoiding traps and ambushes from deadly new foes, the crafty Sanzoku Ippa. The expansion also introduces the B\u014d weapon type for Naoe \u2013 a staff for poking and beating opponents \u2013 and will feature new gear to loot and abilities to unlock.
