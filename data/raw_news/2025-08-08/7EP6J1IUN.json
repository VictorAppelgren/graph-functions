  "description": "A friend of mine applied to all the jobs\u2014literally every job she is qualified for\u2014and this is what she learned.",
  "content": "That is exactly how \u201cSam\u201d opened our conversation. It made me laugh out loud, in spite of myself. Let me set this up real quick. Sam is a former vice president of product who came up through the project management ranks. She\u2019s been out of work since being laid off at the end of last year, so about five full months now.\n\nSam is different. She\u2019s not like you and me. She\u2019s kind of a machine. She\u2019s never been a developer, but she knows all the connective tissue between a developer\u2019s brain and a successful production application\u2014including infrastructure, security, Agile and Scrum, QA, and every flavor of every process that brings good code to paying customers. Sam will tell you that she\u2019s \u201cnot an idea gal.\u201d She executes. With extreme prejudice. I tell you all this to tell you that when Sam loses her job or wants another job, she immediately pulls out every stop, in an optimized and efficient manner, never for a hot second taking her eyes off the goal of \u201cgetting Sam\u2019s butt into a new seat.\u201d\n\nYeah. She went third person there. Last week, to her surprise, Sam realized that in her six months of relentless execution, she had applied to all the jobs she was remotely qualified for. Every single one. There was nothing left to do. No job description she hadn\u2019t combed through, no company she hadn\u2019t researched and reached out to, no networking spoke left unbugged. So she called me and invited me out for coffee.\n\nHyperbole aside, Sam has applied for hundreds of positions, \u201cmaybe over 500,\u201d she says. She has been through dozens of screens and \u201cdefinitely more than 50 interview loops.\u201d If there\u2019s a war for jobs underway right now, this is what Sam has learned from her stint on the front lines. Her words. But I tend to agree.\n\nSam got on the ATS-friendly r\u00e9sum\u00e9 train right away, because the company that let her go had been leaning into AI r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening for about a year, and she had a friend helping with the tech in the HR department. \u201cIt took a month before I realized that I was just throwing darts,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I thought about all the talks I\u2019d had with [my HR tech friend] and it hit me that there\u2019s no single ATS-friendly format, and everyone is probably doing the screening differently.\u201d The responses she was getting were from companies she didn\u2019t really want to work for anyway, usually for low-paying, low-culture jobs. Further, the next step after contact was almost always a series of \u201cvibe check\u201d interviews. Most of the time, these resulted in fun conversations with young HR reps followed by a brief rejection note a week later.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was wasting my time and I needed to get out of that loop,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I took a risk and just redid my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to speak directly to the person I would want to hire me.\u201d That, she said, resulted in better initial contact. There Is Nothing in the Middle Sam immediately decided to apply for everything she could. She has almost 20 years of experience, so she applied to everything from midlevel jobs that required five years of experience all the way to the executive-level jobs that would serve as her logical next career move.\n\n\u201cFifteen years is the max they\u2019ll put into the JD,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWhat does that tell you?\u201d Each time, she tweaked her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and application so as \u201cnot to scare anyone off. I didn\u2019t lie. I was just selective about what I said.\u201d What she noticed is that there were a lot of \u201cjust above entry level\u201d jobs\u2014in other words, people who were already broken in but still cheap. And there were a fair number of director and up positions, less hands-on stuff.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t say you\u2019ll need to be out there selling for those executive jobs, but they imply it pretty heavily,\u201d she said. I take this to mean that there is a lot less emphasis on management. And in my own research, I\u2019ve also found this to be the case. You\u2019ve got labor, and you\u2019ve got sales, and everything else is AI-driven.\n\n\u201cAI Jobs\u201d Are as Dumb as You Think They Are \u201cAt first,\u201d Sam admits, \u201cI wasn\u2019t applying for AI jobs because I don\u2019t have the tech experience there, but after reading some of the requirements I said [WTF], I can use ChatGPT, and I applied for a couple and got responses.\u201d Turns out, no one really knows what an \u201cAI job\u201d is, beyond the PhD-level math and machine learning that drive the AI platforms themselves. According to Sam, almost everything that\u2019s not that is just hiring managers who want to make sure that \u201cyou can use ChatGPT to pretty stuff up, you know, documentation and presentations.\u201d I am shocked that I didn\u2019t assume that.\n\n\u201cI did a stint,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t change the world or anything. I\u2019m really proud of what I did at my last job, but they were under $50 million and falling, so . . .\u201d Money Men (and Women) Are Pulling the Strings There\u2019s a lot more oversight into org structure and hiring in general coming from investors and boards who traditionally don\u2019t play as much of a role in the company makeup below the C-suite. This is something I asked Sam about, and her eyes lighted up.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had . . . three loops that went great, and right before the offer I got set up with some rando or a private equity guy and then whammo. Is that a thing?\u201d Yeah. She said \u201cwhammo.\u201d And, yeah, that\u2019s a thing. I know this because I\u2019ve been the rando. I\u2019ve been asked to vet executives multiple times this year by those very venture capitalists and \u201cprivate equity guys.\u201d Sam and I had a long and winding conversation, and I\u2019ve tried to put this in a format with a single cohesive thread. If I had to pick, that thread would be \u201cno confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then one morning last week, I went to my laptop and there was nothing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me some time to figure it out, but every job board, all my networking tracking, everything. I was up to date. It made me a little scared.\u201d A few days later, Sam did text me to tell me that new jobs were coming in and chatter had picked up across her network. In my mind, this is a wave, and a necessary one, as companies continue to figure out what isn\u2019t working, and then try to figure out what will. Or, at least, that\u2019s what my optimistic side says.",
