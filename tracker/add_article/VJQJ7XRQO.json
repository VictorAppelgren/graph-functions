      "summary": "The article discusses the risk of political interference in the Federal Reserve, citing past politicized periods that led to stagflation. It highlights a Supreme Court case that could reinforce the Fed’s independence by limiting executive removal of its governors. The piece warns that a Trump‑friendly Fed could trigger short‑term rate cuts but ultimately drive higher long‑term rates and inflation, undermining the U.S. safe‑harbor premium. Maintaining Fed credibility is portrayed as essential for stable borrowing costs and business investment.",
