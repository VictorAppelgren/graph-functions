  "title": "Off-duty NYPD officer points pistol at teens in fit of road rage, official says",
  "description": "The officer was arrested and has been temporarily suspended.",
  "content": "An off-duty New York City police detective pulled out his pistol and pointed it at three 16-year-olds on the road in front of him after officials said the teens were forced to suddenly stop, causing him to also brake.\n\nJohn O\u2019Connell, 36, drove next to the car, rolled down his window and shouted \u201cI have a gun\u201d while aiming a loaded weapon at the teen who was driving on Route 9 in Somers the evening of Aug. 28, according to the Westchester County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nHe was armed with a Glock 19 pistol, the district attorney\u2019s office said in a Sept. 2 news release announcing O\u2019Connell\u2019s arrest and temporary suspension from the NYPD\u2019s warrant squad.\n\nO\u2019Connell, of Patterson, New York, is charged with several misdemeanors, according to officials, including second-degree menacing, three counts of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty in Somers Town Court on Aug. 29, officials said. Somers is about a 50-mile drive northeast from New York City.\n\nInformation on O\u2019Connell\u2019s legal representation was not immediately available.\n\nO\u2019Connell later \u201ccontinued to drive in an aggressive manner toward the teens before they were able to break off and call the police,\u201d according to their depositions, the district attorney\u2019s office said.\n\nO\u2019Connell was released on his own recognizance because the charges stemming from the road rage incident are not eligible for bail, according to the office.\n\nThe NYPD did not immediately return McClatchy News\u2019 request for comment Sept. 3.\n\nIn a statement, Westchester County District Attorney Susan Cacace said \u201cIt is unacceptable for anyone to turn a traffic grievance into a lethal threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teenage victims in this case demonstrated a laudable measure of composure in navigating a dangerous situation to safety, and I commend them for their courage,\u201d Cacace added.\n\nO\u2019Connell\u2019s next court appearance is set for Sept. 8, according to Cacace\u2019s office.\n\nJulia Marnin covers courts for McClatchy News, writing about criminal and civil affairs, including cases involving policing, corrections, civil liberties, fraud, and abuses of power.
