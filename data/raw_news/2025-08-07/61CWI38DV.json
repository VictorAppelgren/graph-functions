  "content": "The new variant XFG, or \u201cStratus,\u201d has become the third-most dominant strain of COVID-19 this summer and is driving up case estimates in New Jersey.\n\nStratus is similar in symptoms and seriousness to other Omicron variants, but it may present a never-before-seen symptom: hoarseness. New data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows Stratus accounted for 14 percent of COVID-19 cases in late June. Stratus was first detected in Southeast Asia in January, but didn\u2019t show up in U.S. surveillance reports until May, when it represented less than 0 percent of infections. The World Health Organization classified XFG as a \u201cvariant under monitoring\u201d in June.\n\nGetting a full picture of COVID-19 activity can be difficult given shifting priorities in federal and state health policy. But several key measures help put together a picture of what\u2019s happening in New Jersey. The CDC said that as of July 29, its COVID-19 forecasting models show infection rates in New Jersey are growing.\n\nOverall, the projections show infections are growing or likely to grow in 40 states and are unchanged in nine others. The highest rates of transmission are in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and Midwest. The public health agency also said COVID viral activity in wastewater remains \u201clow\u201d nationally, but at least 10 states had \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d levels, as of July 12.\n\nWith 20 sites reporting, viral activity in New Jersey is currently low. For the seven-day period ending July 31, 0.49 percent of emergency room visits in New Jersey had been for COVID-19.\n\nAlthough hoarseness is unique to Stratus, symptoms common to other variants include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headache, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. The Stratus variant may be better than others at evading immunity protection, according to experts. Although vaccine guidance is changing, the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against \u201csevere illness, hospitalization and death.\u201d",

      "text": "At a glance\n- For U.S. states, CFA and NCIRD estimate the time-varying reproductive number, Rt\u2014a measure that helps quickly assess whether infections are increasing or decreasing. This helps public health practitioners prepare and respond.\nEpidemic trends\nWe estimate the time-varying reproductive number, Rt, a measure of transmission based on data from incident emergency department (ED) visits. Epidemic status was determined by estimating the probability that Rt is greater than 1 (map below). Estimated Rt values above 1 indicate epidemic growth.\nThe second figure below shows the estimated Rt and uncertainty interval from June 4, 2025 through July 29, 2025 for the U.S. and for each reported state. (Click on the map to view the data for a specific state). While Rt tells us if the number of infections is likely growing or declining, it does not reflect the burden of disease. Rt should be used alongside other surveillance metrics (such as the percentage of ED visits, which are displayed in the callout boxes in the map) for a more complete picture. View a summary of key data for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV.\nCOVID-19\nAs of July 29, 2025, we estimate that COVID-19 infections are growing or likely growing in 40 states, declining or likely declining in 0 states, and not changing in 9 states. Previous estimates can be found on data.cdc.gov.\nInfluenza\nAs of May 30, 2025, Rt is only estimated for COVID-19. Estimates of influenza Rt have ended for the 2024-2025 season and will begin again in the 2025-2026 season. Previous estimates can be found on data.cdc.gov. Emergency department visit data can be found: Respiratory Virus Activity Levels | Respiratory Illnesses | CDC\nInterpreting Rt\n- Rt is a data-driven measure of disease transmission. Rt is an estimate on date t of the average number of new infections caused by each infectious person. Rt accounts for current population susceptibility, public health interventions, and behavior.\n- Rt > 1 indicates that infections are growing because, on average, each infected person is causing more than one new infection while Rt < 1 indicates that infections are declining.\n- Rt can be a leading indicator of increases or decreases in cases, hospitalizations, or deaths, because transmission occurs before case confirmation, hospitalization, or death.\n- The uncertainty range for each Rt estimate determines the probability that infections are growing. For example, if 75% of the uncertainty range falls above 1, then there is a 75% chance that the infections are growing in that location.\n- When the data are sparse, the model used to generate Rt estimates will tend to generate estimates nearer to 1 with wide credible intervals, which reflects uncertainty in the true epidemic trend during these time periods.\nWhat Rt can and cannot tell us\nWhat Rt can tell us: Rt can tell us whether a current epidemic trend is growing, declining, or not changing, and is an additional tool to help public health practitioners prepare and respond.\nWhat Rt cannot tell us: Rt cannot tell us about the underlying burden of disease, just the trend of transmission. An Rt < 1 does not mean that transmission is low, just that infections are declining. It is useful to look at respiratory disease activity in conjunction with Rt.\nCaveats and limitations\n- Rt estimates are sensitive to assumptions about the generation interval distribution.\n- Rt estimates may be over-or-underestimated if the proportion of infections that result in emergency department visits changes abruptly. These estimates can be impacted by shifts in clinical severity, increased or decreased use of clinical testing, or changes in reporting.\nMethods\nRt is defined as the average number of new infections caused by each infected person at a particular time, t. When Rt > 1, infections are growing, and when Rt < 1, infections are declining. The color categories in the maps above were determined by estimating a distribution of possible Rt values based on the observed emergency department visit data and model assumptions (formally, a \u201ccredible interval\u201d). We then calculate the proportion of that credible interval where the Rt > 1. Credible intervals are determined using the EpiNow2 package, which uses a Bayesian model to estimate Rt, while adjusting for delays and reporting effects.\n- If >90% of the credible interval distribution of Rt >1, infections are growing\n- If 76%-90% of the credible interval distribution of Rt > 1, infections are likely growing\n- If 26%-75% of the credible interval distribution of Rt > 1, infections are not changing (in this case, the credible interval spans across 1, and contains a mix of values above and below 1.)\n- If 10%-25% of the credible interval distribution of Rt > 1, infections are likely declining; this is equivalent to 75%-90% of the credible interval of Rt \u2264 1\n- If <10% of the credible interval distribution of Rt > 1, infections are declining; this is equivalent to >90% of the credible interval of Rt \u2264 1\n- The data used to estimate Rt are updated frequently, and initially-reported counts might later be revised. We manually review the data weekly and occasionally exclude implausible outlier values, but may still estimate Rt.\n- Rt was not estimated for states in the following cases: 1. fewer than 10 emergency department visits for the disease were reported in each of the prior 2 weeks, 2. there were detected anomalies in reported values, and 3. the model did not pass checks for reliability.\nRt estimates are derived from daily counts of new disease-specific emergency department visits reported through the National Syndromic Surveillance Program. This Rt : Behind the Model article provides a more in-depth overview of the modeling approach used to estimate Rt, and the strategies CDC uses to validate the accuracy of estimates.\nTo estimate Rt, we fit Bayesian models to the data using the R packages EpiNow2, epinowcast, or using Stan models developed by the CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics. Following best practices, these models adjust for lags from infection to observation, incomplete observation of recent infection events, and day-of-week reporting effects, in addition to uncertainty from all these adjustments.\nGlossary of terms\n- Generation interval: the interval between the infection times of an infector-infectee pair; i.e. the difference in the time when an individual (Person j) is infected by an infector (Person i) and the time when this infector (Person i) was infected.\n- Leading indicator: a variable that provides an early indication of future trends in an outbreak, e.g., Rt, as this metric estimates the number of infections caused by one infected person in near real-time.\n- Lagging indicator: a variable that provides a lagged indication of future trends in an outbreak, e.g., COVID-19 deaths, as this outcome happens after cases have occurred."

      "text": "COVID-19 National Wastewater Data\nCOVID-19 Wastewater Monitoring in the U.S.\nWastewater monitoring can detect viruses spreading from one person to another within a community earlier than clinical testing and before people who are sick go to their doctor or hospital. It can also detect infections without symptoms. If you see increased wastewater viral activity levels, it might indicate that there is a higher risk of infection. See how to protect yourself from respiratory viruses.\nWastewater data are updated every Friday with the previous week\u2019s data, which allows for data to be reviewed for accuracy. Data may change as more reports are received.\nCurrent Wastewater Viral Activity Levels\nThis map shows the current wastewater viral activity level of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) for each state or territory. Tap or hover over a state or territory to see the viral activity level and number of sites reporting data.\nNational and Regional Trends\nThis chart shows national and regional trends of wastewater viral activity levels of SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).\nAbout the Wastewater Viral Activity Level: The wastewater viral activity level indicates whether the amount of virus in the wastewater is very low, low, moderate, high, or very high. The wastewater viral activity levels may indicate the risk of infection in an area. The wastewater viral activity levels are categorized as follows:\n- Up to 1.5 \u2013 Very Low\n- Greater than 1.5 and up to 3 \u2013 Low\n- Greater than 3 and up to 4.5 \u2013 Moderate\n- Greater than 4.5 and up to 8 \u2013 High\n- Greater than 8 \u2013 Very High\nTo learn more on how the wastewater viral activity level is calculated, see Data Methods.\nHow site-level wastewater viral activity levels are aggregated: National, regional, and state/territory data represent the median values across all wastewater treatment plants in the respective area. The wastewater viral activity level for an area may not represent every community in the area since some geographic areas may have a higher density of sampling sites.\nRegions: States and territories are grouped into the following U.S Census Bureau regions:\n- West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming (N=14)\n- Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin (N=12)\n- Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Vermont (N=10)\n- South: Arkansas, Alabama, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia (N=17)\nNo Data: States or territories without sufficient data to estimate the wastewater viral activity level for the previous week are indicated as \u201cNo Data.\u201d A label of \u201cNo Data\u201d means that either:\n- No data were reported this week from sites within the state or territory\n- Data were reported this week, but sites within the state or territory do not have enough data (at least 6 weeks with consistent methodology) to estimate the Wastewater Viral Activity Level in the last week.\nLimited Coverage: States or territories with limited coverage means that data for the most recent week are based on a small part (less than 5%) of the population and may not represent viral activity levels for the entire state or territory."
