  "content": "A New York appeals court on Thursday tossed the roughly $500 million fine against President Trump in a defeat for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused his business of inflating property value and deceiving banks.\n\nThe court heard the dispute a year ago and had yet to deliver a decision, which is unusual as the New York Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, usually issues rulings within a few weeks.\n\n\u201cWhile the injunctive relief ordered by the court is well crafted to curb defendants\u2019 business culture, the court\u2019s disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,\u201d Judges Dianne T. Renwick and Peter H. Moulton wrote, according to The Associated Press.\n\nMs. James\u2019 office said that despite the decision, it will continue to push the legal battle, according to Fox News.\n\nThe dispute has been pending since oral arguments in September 2024.\n\nThe president was looking at a more than $500 million penalty after Ms. James won a case against him and the Trump Organization for allegedly defrauding banks. However, the banks testified at trial that they were paid in full.\n\nDuring oral arguments, some of the judges appeared skeptical of the state\u2019s case. One judge said the consumer fraud case against Mr. Trump was unusual because there were no victims.",
