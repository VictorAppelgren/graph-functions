  "title": "Why Trump\u2019s \u201cgolden dome\u201d missile defense idea is another ripped straight from the movies",
  "description": "President Trump has proposed building an antimissile \u201cgolden dome\u201d around the United States. But do cinematic spectacles actually enhance national security?",
  "content": "In 1940, a fresh-faced Ronald Reagan starred as US Secret Service agent Brass Bancroft in Murder in the Air, an action film centered on a fictional \u201csuperweapon\u201d that could stop enemy aircraft midflight. A mock newspaper in the movie hails it as the \u201cgreatest peace argument ever invented.\u201d The experimental weapon is \u201cthe exclusive property of Uncle Sam,\u201d Reagan\u2019s character declares. More than 40 years later, this cinematic vision\u2014an American superweapon capable of neutralizing assaults and ushering in global peace\u2014became a real-life centerpiece of Reagan\u2019s presidency. Some have suggested that Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a quixotic plan for a space-based missile shield, may have been partly inspired by his silver-screen past; indeed, the concept was so fantastical it\u2019s now better known by its Hollywood-referencing nickname, \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\n\nIn January 2024, Donald Trump revived the space-shield dream at a primary campaign rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, using the Star Wars nickname that Reagan hated. It didn\u2019t work in the 1980s, Trump said, because the technology wasn\u2019t there. But times have changed. Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump\u2019s impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many things. I\u2019ve seen shots that you wouldn\u2019t even believe,\u201d Trump said. He acted out a scene of missile defense experts triangulating the path of an incoming weapon. \u201cDing, ding, ding, ding,\u201d he said, as he mimed typing on a keyboard. \u201cMissile launch? Psshing!!\u201d He raised his hand to indicate the rising missile, then let it fall to signal the successful interception: \u201cBoom.\u201d Trump has often expressed admiration for Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, an air defense system that can intercept short-range rockets and artillery over the small nation and that is funded in part by the United States. At the rally, he pledged to \u201cbuild an Iron Dome over our country, a state-of-the-art missile defense shield made in the USA \u2026 a lot of it right here in New Hampshire, actually.\u201d Within a week of his inauguration, President Trump began working toward this promise by issuing an executive order to develop \u201cThe Iron Dome for America,\u201d which was rebranded the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d a month later. The eruption of a revived conflict between Israel and Iran in June\u2014including Trump\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities\u2014has only strengthened the case for an American version of the Iron Dome in the eyes of the administration. The Golden Dome has often been compared to SDI for its futuristic sheen, its aggressive form of protection, and its reflection of the belief that an impenetrable shield is the cheat code to global peace. Both efforts demonstrate the performative power of spectacle in defense policy, especially when wielded by deft showmen like Reagan and Trump. Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump\u2019s impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure, often rendered in deceptively simple concept art depicting a society made immune to catastrophic strikes. But in the complicated security landscape confronting the world today, is spectacle the same as safety? \u201cMissile defense is an area where facts and fiction blend,\u201d says Anette Stimmer, a lecturer in international relations at the University of St Andrews who has researched SDI. \u201cA lot is up to interpretation by all the actors involved.\u201d Trump\u2019s view is simple: Space is as much a warfighting domain as land, air, and ocean, and therefore the US must assert its dominance there with advanced technologies. This position inspired the creation of the US Space Force in his first term, and Trump has now redoubled his efforts with the ongoing development of the Golden Dome.\n\nGeneral Michael Guetlein, who Trump has appointed to lead the Golden Dome project, argued that America\u2019s foes, including China and Russia, have forced the nation\u2019s hand by continually pushing limits in their own weapons programs. \u201cWhile we have been focused on peace overseas, our adversaries have been quickly modernizing their nuclear forces, building out ballistic missiles capable of hosting multiple warheads; building out hypersonic missiles capable of attacking the United States within an hour and traveling at 6,000 miles an hour; building cruise missiles that can navigate around our radar and our defenses; and building submarines that can sneak up on our shores; and, worse yet, building space weapons,\u201d Guetlein said in May. \u201cIt is time that we change that equation and start doubling down on the protection of the homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cGolden Dome is a bold and aggressive approach to hurry up and protect the homeland from our adversaries. We owe it to our children and our children\u2019s children to protect them and afford them a quality of life that we have all grown up enjoying.\u201d With that vision in mind, Trump\u2019s executive order outlines a host of goals for missile defense, some of which support bipartisan priorities like protecting supply chains and upgrading sensor arrays. The specific architecture of the Golden Dome is still being hammered out, but the initial executive order envisions a multi-tiered system of new sensors and interceptors\u2014on the ground, in the air, and in space\u2014that would work together to counter the threat of attacks from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. The system would be coordinated in part by artificial-intelligence models trained for real-time threat detection and response. The technology that links the Golden Dome directly to SDI hinges on one key bullet point in the order that demands the \u201cdevelopment and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept.\u201d This language revives Reagan\u2019s dream of deploying hundreds of missile interceptors in orbit to target missiles in the boost phase right after liftoff, a window of just a few minutes when the projectiles are slower and still near the attacker\u2019s territory. Space weapons are an attractive option for targeting the boost phase because interceptors need to be close enough to the launching missile to hit it. If a nation fired off long-range missiles from deep in its territory, the nearest ground- or air-based interceptors could be thousands of miles from the launch site. Space interceptors, in contrast, would be just a few hundred miles overhead of the ascending missiles, allowing for a much faster reaction time. But though the dream of boost-phase interception dates back decades, these maneuvers have never been operationally demonstrated from ground, air, or space.\n\nThe GMD is not designed to protect the US from the sort of large-scale and coordinated missile attacks that Russia and China could lob across the world. The Bush administration instead favored a focus on strategic deterrence with these peer nations, an approach that the Obama and Biden administrations continued. In addition to the GMD, the Pentagon and its international partners maintain regional defense systems to counter threats in conflict hot spots or attacks on critical infrastructure. All these networks are designed to intercept missiles during their midcourse cruise phase, as they hurtle through the sky or space, or during their terminal or reentry phase, as they approach their targets. The GMD has cost upward of $63 billion since it was initiated, and the US spends about an additional $20 billion to $30 billion annually on its array of other missile defense systems. In May, Trump was presented with several design options for the Golden Dome and selected a plan with a price tag of $175 billion and a schedule for full deployment by the end of his term. The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law on July 4, approved an initial $24.4 billion in funding for it. Space technologies and launch access have become much more affordable since the 1980s, but many analysts still think the projected cost and timeline are not realistic. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, projected that the cost of the space-based interceptors could total from $161 billion to $542 billion over the course of 20 years. The wide range can be explained by the current lack of specifics on those orbital interceptors\u2019 design and number. Reintroducing the idea of space-based interceptors is \u201cprobably the most controversial piece of Golden Dome,\u201d says Leonor Tomero, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy in the Biden administration. \u201cThere are a lot of improvements that we can and should make on missile defense,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of capability gaps I think we do need to address. My concern is the focus on reviving Star Wars and SDI. It\u2019s got very significant policy implications, strategic stability implications, in addition to cost implications and technology feasibility challenges.\u201d Indeed. Regardless of whether the Golden Dome materializes, the program is already raising geopolitical anxieties reminiscent of the Cold War era. Back then, the US had one main adversary: the Soviet Union. Now, it confronts a roiling multipolarity of established and nascent nuclear powers. Many of them have expressed dismay over the about-face on American missile defense strategy, which was previously predicated on arms reduction and deterrence. \u201cHere we are, despite years of saying we are not going to do this\u2014that it is technically out of reach, economically unsustainable, and strategically unwise,\u201d Grego says. \u201cOvernight, we\u2019re like, \u2018No, actually, we\u2019re doing it.\u2019\u201d\n\nReagan, by all accounts, believed that SDI would be the ultimate tool of peace for all nations, and he even offered to share the technology with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Trump, in contrast, sees Golden Dome as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d brand. He has lamented that past American leaders supported the development of other missile defense projects abroad while neglecting to build similar security measures for their own country. The Golden Dome is both an expression of Trump\u2019s belief that the world is leeching off America and a bargaining chip in negotiations toward a new power balance; Canada could be covered by the shield for free, he has said\u2014in exchange for becoming the 51st state. Trump has argued that America has been both demographically diluted by unchecked immigration and financially depleted by freeloading allied nations\u2014undermining its security on both internal and external fronts. His first term\u2019s marquee promise to build a wall on the southern US border, paid for by Mexico, aimed to address the former problem. That administration did build more physical barriers along the border (though US taxpayers, not Mexico, footed the bill). But just as important, the wall emerged as a symbolic shorthand for tougher immigration control. The Golden Dome is the second-term amplification of that promise, a wall that expands the concept of the \u201cborder\u201d to the entire American airspace. Trump has projected an image of his envisioned space missile shield as a literal dome that could ward off coordinated attacks, including boost-phase interceptors from space and cruise- and terminal-phase interception by ground and air assets. When he announced the selected plan from the Resolute Desk in May, he sat in front of a mockup that depicted a barrage of incoming missiles being thwarted by the nationwide shield, depicted with a golden glow. The Golden Dome\u2019s orbital interceptors are supposedly there to target the early boost phase of missiles on or near the launch site, not over the United States. But the image of a besieged America, repelling enemy fire from the heavens, provides the visual and cinematic idea of both threat and security that Trump hopes to impress on the public. \u201cThis administration, and MAGA world, thinks about itself as being victimized by immigrants, government waste, leftist professors, and so on,\u201d says Edward Tabor Linenthal, a historian who examined public narratives about SDI in his 1989 book Symbolic Defense: The Cultural Significance of the Strategic Defense Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a jump to be victimized by too many nations getting nuclear weapons.\u201d Even in our era of entrenched political polarization, there is support across party lines for upgrading and optimizing America\u2019s missile defense systems. No long-range missile has ever struck US soil, but an attack would be disastrous for the nation and the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in terms of missile defense,\u201d says Tomero. \u201cThere has been a lot of bipartisan consensus on increasing regional missile defense, working with our allies, and making sure that the missile defense interceptors we have work.\u201d Trump has challenged that consensus with his reversion to the dream of a space shield. He is correct that SDI failed to materialize in part because its envisioned technologies were out of reach, from a financial and engineering standpoint, in the 1980s. But the controversy that erupted around SDI\u2014and that tarnished it with the derisive name \u201cStar Wars\u201d\u2014stemmed just as much from its potential geopolitical disruptiveness as from its fantastical techno-optimism.\n\n\u201cThis idea of a missile shield, also back when Reagan proposed it, has a huge popular appeal, because who wouldn\u2019t want to be able to defend your country from nuclear weapons? It is a universal dream,\u201d says Stimmer. \u201cIt requires a bit more digging in and understanding to see that actually, this vision depends a lot on technological feasibility and on how others perceive it.\u201d Reagan maintained a steadfast conviction that this shield of space-based interceptors would render nuclear weapons \u201cimpotent and obsolete,\u201d ushering in \u201cworld peace,\u201d as he said in his March 1983 speech announcing SDI. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction could be replaced by mutually assured survival, he argued. Amid nuclear tensions, J. Robert Oppenheimer compared the US and the Soviet Union to \u201ctwo scorpions in a bottle.\u201d Now there are many more scorpions. But Gorbachev saw the space-based shield as an offensive weapon, since it would give the US a first-strike advantage. The imbalance, he warned, could spark a weapons race in space, a domain that had been spared from overt military conflicts. As a result, the initiative would only destabilize the world order and interrupt the progress of arms control and nuclear de-proliferation efforts. Reagan\u2019s insistence on SDI as the only route to world peace may have blocked opportunities to advance that goal through more practical and cost-effective avenues, such as diplomacy and arms control. At the 1986 Reykjavik Summit, Reagan and Gorbachev came very close to an arms control agreement that might have eliminated all ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The sticking point was Reagan\u2019s refusal to give up SDI.",

      "text": "Earlier this year in a high-stakes summit meeting, the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, and U.S. president Donald Trump failed to agree on a way to end North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons program. Within days of the summit, satellite imagery showed that Kim was rebuilding some of North Korea\u2019s rocket facilities.\nIn 2017 Kim\u2019s government had tested its first long-range missiles and soon followed up with a test of what appeared to be a powerful hydrogen bomb. After those operations, Trump told Americans not to worry. \u201cWe build the greatest military equipment in the world,\u201d he said on the Fox News television channel. \u201cWe have missiles that can knock out a missile in the air 97 percent of the time. If you send two of them, they are going to get knocked down.\u201d\nThe president was expressing extraordinary faith in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, currently the country\u2019s sole guard against intercontinental ballistic missiles that carry nuclear warheads. But his faith was woefully misplaced, and facts belie his claim. U.S. military testing data show there is no basis to expect GMD interceptors to work more than about 50 percent of the time. Using multiple interceptors against each target could in some cases improve these odds but will not fundamentally change the situation. The chances of a nuclear weapon getting through in a real-world attack using multiple missiles is still dangerously high. Our analysis of all 19 tests done\u2014the most recent one was in late March\u2014as well as several government reviews of the program, shows an alarmingly high failure rate.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nThe problems with these interceptors can be traced back decades, to the beginnings of the program, because the Pentagon rushed to develop it and abandoned tried-and-true oversight and testing requirements that have been used for most major weapons. Plus, the system is vulnerable to defense-penetrating countermeasures that any country capable of building a long-range missile could take. Yet the Pentagon is moving to expand the troubled interceptor fleet despite already spending more than $40 billion to produce these unreliable results.\nThe arms race\nThe world has been living under the threat of nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since the late 1950s. Two nuclear-armed nations, the former Soviet Union and the U.S., were desperate to deter each other from using these weapons. Both built more missiles, armed with multiple warheads, to overwhelm any response the other country might be able to mount. This cycle of action and reaction resulted in the rapidly growing potential for mass destruction.\nEventually U.S. and Soviet leaders recognized the dangers of this tit for tat, and in 1972 they signed the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I). They also agreed to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which strictly limited defenses against long-range missiles and served to break the cycle of defensive advances prompting the other side to improve its offense. These arms-control agreements and those that followed did the job. The breakneck growth of the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals peaked in 1986 at more than 60,000 weapons, and three decades of arms reductions have brought that number down to fewer than 10,000 today.\nWhile the stockpiles were still high, in 1983, President Ronald Reagan\u2014driven by distrust of the Soviets and faith in new technologies\u2014tried to revitalize missile defense and announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, or \u201cStar Wars.\u201d His vision was based on nonexistent and impractical innovations, such as space-based lasers powered by nuclear explosions, and after a while plans for the system were scrapped.\nBut research on strategic missile defense technology continued as new threats emerged. North Korea\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which became apparent in the 1990s, provided a fresh argument for strategic defenses that took advantage of improvements in missile tracking and interceptor guidance. Still, limitations of the technology, skepticism about the magnitude of the threat, and concerns that deploying defenses would threaten the successful and ongoing arms-reduction process led the Clinton administration to respect the ABM Treaty limits.\nThen, on September 11, 2001, everything changed. In the political environment following the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the start of the \u201cwar on terror,\u201d opponents of missile defense found it difficult to argue against any military programs. Congress could muster only limited debate on arms control. In late 2001, citing a potentially growing threat from rogue nations and terrorism, the George W. Bush administration announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the ABM Treaty. Then the government said it would rush ahead with a plan to build a missile defense system. The era of negotiated limits on missile defenses was over.\nThe incoming threat\nDestroying an ICBM\u2019s warhead is not easy. These missiles launch thousands of kilometers from their targets, accelerated by powerful engines in what is called their boost phase. Within minutes they reach speeds of about 25,000 kilometers per hour and then can release multiple warheads that arc through the vacuum of space. After about half an hour of this midcourse flight, they reenter the atmosphere and drop toward their targets in the terminal flight phase, which lasts only a few minutes.\nDefense efforts have focused on the midcourse period because it lasts much longer than the boost phase, and by intercepting at long distances from the targets, the system can defend much larger areas than it could at the terminal stage. The earliest interceptors carried their own nuclear weapons to blow up the incoming warhead. But in the late 1970s development began on prototype interceptors that carried a nonexplosive \u201ckill vehicle.\u201d Onboard sensors were supposed to guide the vehicle into the incoming warhead during its midcourse phase. At a collision speed of 10 kilometers per second, the kinetic energy per mass is more than 10 times the energy released by a similar amount of high explosives, so such impacts could destroy warheads in a direct hit and avoid the use of a nuclear detonation for defense. This \u201chit to kill\u201d method requires sophisticated technology. The kill vehicles must be guided to within centimeters of a precise target point on the incoming missile warhead.\nBush\u2019s plan was to get a system into the field quickly and then improve it. In September 2004 the administration stated that the system had achieved a \u201climited deployment option,\u201d which meant it could be turned on and used if necessary. Only five interceptors were in place the day of that announcement.\nToday the GMD comprises space-based sensors, terrestrial radars, 44 interceptors based in Alaska and California, and facilities and personnel to control operations. The Department of Defense\u2019s current plan is to increase the number of interceptors to 64 by 2023 and possibly add more soon thereafter to reach a total of 100.\nHoles in the defense\nThe push to deploy this system, however, has produced serious shortcomings, and the GMD has yet to demonstrate a useful military capability. The roots of the problems lie both in the shortcuts the government took to move the program forward and in the technical complexity of missile defense.\nIn 2002 Bush\u2019s DOD exempted the program from the Pentagon\u2019s traditional \u201cfly before you buy\u201d oversight rules, intended to make sure major defense systems and equipment work well before the nation has to depend on them. Under those rules, the GMD system would need to meet criteria for technical maturity and effectiveness and to undergo demanding operational tests to ensure that it worked as required under real-world conditions before being put in the field. But Bush\u2019s exemption meant that prototype interceptors for research and development\u2014by definition not intended for the real world\u2014could be used in urgent situations. While faster, this approach permits the use of unreliable or poorly tested equipment.\nIn 2014\u201410 years after the limited deployment announcement\u2014all GMD interceptors in the field were put there before the Pentagon had conducted a single successful intercept test of their design, according to reviews by the DOD and Congress. Ideally, a rigorous engineering process identifies problems early and allows them to be fixed before deployment. But with the GMD system, failed intercept tests revealed design flaws that required expensive retrofits of dozens of interceptors already in silos. Because the interceptors were being fielded as they were being tested, hardware and software components and designs vary from interceptor to interceptor, making it difficult to use the performance of one to predict that of another or to resolve problems across the entire fleet.\nGMD interceptors have destroyed their targets in just more than half the 19 intercept tests conducted. The record is not improving with time. Six of the 11 tests since 2004 have failed to destroy their target. Of the most recent six tests, three have failed.\nA number of these failures were attributed to lapses in quality control, according to the Missile Defense Agency, the Pentagon office that runs the program. The agency stated in 2007 that poor manufacturing and setup procedures by its contractors\u2014which it attributed to the streamlining of the acquisition process and schedule pressures\u2014had caused \u201ctest failures and slowed production.\u201d A failed $236-million intercept test in January 2010 was attributed in part to a small device called a lockwire, which Raytheon, the contractor that builds the kill vehicles, did not install. A report by the DOD\u2019s inspector general, following that mistake, found many other serious quality-management problems.\nThese quality-control troubles can slow progress by masking other flaws that tests are supposed to uncover. For example, the January 2010 test was repeated later that year and failed again, but that time the trouble was attributed to a design flaw: vibrations from the rocket motors the kill vehicle uses to change direction could cause errors in the guidance system. This design issue might have been identified earlier if the missing lockwire had not derailed the earlier test. Identifying the bigger problem and fixing the interceptors that had already been put in the field eventually cost nearly $2 billion.\nAnother disturbing aspect of the high failure rate is that it has occurred in highly simplified tests that do not resemble situations an interceptor would face against an actual enemy. No GMD test, for instance, has involved an incoming missile that used countermeasures such as realistic decoys. Incoming weapons can carry numerous decoys that appear very similar to warheads; the GMD must find the real warhead among the fakes. But tests have deliberately used decoys that appear very different from the actual mock warhead, making the interceptor\u2019s job artificially easy.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t discriminate what the real threatening objects are, it doesn\u2019t matter how many [ground-based interceptors] we have. We won\u2019t be able to hit what needs to be hit,\u201d Michael Gilmore, then director of Operational Test and Evaluation for the Pentagon, told Congress in 2013.\nThe poor test record of the GMD system stands in stark contrast to repeated statements by U.S. military and political officials over the years that give an inaccurately optimistic appraisal of the system. For example, in congressional testimony in April 2016, Admiral Bill Gortney, then commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command, said, \u201cWe are prepared to engage and protect Hawaii, Alaska and all the rest of the states with the existing system and have high confidence in its success.\u201d In fact, the system has not demonstrated capability under real-world conditions. The most recent test, in March, was the first one that the Pentagon actually described as operational rather than developmental. The agency said the interceptors (it fired two) destroyed the target, but it has not released enough information about the test to permit an independent evaluation of the test conditions.\nIneffective deterrence\nEven while acknowledging the GMD\u2019s limits, some contend that any capability is better than none. This argument, however, has serious flaws.\nThe 2019 Missile Defense Review asserts that a missile defense system such as the GMD helps to deter a missile attack by increasing an adversary\u2019s uncertainty. The attacker might doubt its ability to destroy enough U.S. forces to avoid a retaliatory strike, for instance. But such doubts are already in place: U.S. retaliation is assured by nuclear forces safely hidden on submarines at sea. And this logic certainly does not apply to an adversary whose intent is not to target U.S. retaliatory capability in the first place, such as North Korea or even China. Those nations\u2019 missile arsenals are too small and inaccurate to mount an effective strike against U.S. nuclear forces. Instead they would target cities or other large, unprotected sites. Therefore, missile defense is unlikely to offer anything that adds to the deterrence currently provided by U.S. forces.\nThe Missile Defense Review also argues that the U.S. needs a defensive shield so an adversary\u2019s missile threats cannot force this nation away from taking military actions in its own interests or on behalf of an ally. But to make U.S. decision makers confident enough to ignore adversarial threats, a system such as the GMD needs to demonstrate high effectiveness, and it has not.\nAt its core, missile defense is meant to defeat a nuclear attack if deterrence were to fail. While this is where the \u201csome is better than none\u201d argument is the most persuasive, for any realistic scenario, missile defense will likely do very little. Even if the system\u2019s ability to deal with real-world complexities such as countermeasures were greatly improved, a nuclear attack will still present enormous risks. For example, if the system achieved an improbably high 95 percent effectiveness against one missile, in an attack by just five missiles there is still a one-in-four chance of at least one nuclear warhead penetrating the defense. The likelihood of a city being destroyed would be higher than correctly predicting the roll of a die. The effectiveness against a real attack is likely to be much lower.\nWhat missile defenses may actually do is get in the way of reducing the nuclear threat faced by the U.S. or even increase it. As long as nations such as Russia and China continue to rely on strategic arsenals for deterrence, pursuing defenses that appear to threaten that deterrent\u2014or that lay the groundwork for a system that may threaten it in the future\u2014will at best hinder nuclear reductions. At worst these efforts will lead to the growth of more offensive weapons designed to overwhelm the defense and reduce stability by increasing the incentive to launch missiles first in a crisis.\nThere is growing evidence that global powers are already returning to this type of brinkmanship, which the ABM Treaty sought to quell. As part of its ratification process for the 2011 New START arms-control treaty with the U.S., Russia stipulated that further cuts to its arsenal would require limitations on strategic defenses. More recently, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia is developing several new strategic nuclear delivery systems that are designed specifically to defeat or evade U.S. missile defense systems. These include a nuclear-capable hypersonic weapon that could fly undetected by current sensors and a drone submarine that could carry nuclear weapons designed to destroy U.S. coastal cities.\nChina, for its part, recently added multiple nuclear warheads to its large ballistic missiles\u2014a change the DOD, in its report to Congress on China\u2019s military power, attributed in part to concerns about advances in U.S. strategic defenses.\nBeyond the potential for missile defense to increase nuclear threats the U.S. faces is the real possibility that a false sense of security will distort U.S. decision-making. Misunderstanding the system\u2019s capability and believing that missile defense is highly effective or even somewhat effective could lead U.S. leaders to take more risks in foreign policy. An unfounded faith in missile defense reduces incentives to pursue political solutions to national security problems and to improve nuclear arms control. Nuclear-armed missiles are a political problem that technology cannot solve.\nHeightened risk\nAlthough the modest size of the current GMD system somewhat limits its destabilizing potential, missile defense proponents are pushing to expand other U.S. missile defense capabilities. The navy\u2019s Aegis ship-based missile defense system was developed to defend against short- and medium-range missiles in particular regions, but Congress has called for testing a new Aegis interceptor against an intercontinental-range missile, thus demonstrating its potential for strategic missile defense. Current plans call for deploying several hundred of these new interceptors on ships over the next two decades to establish a large, mobile, strategic missile defense capability that could be used around the world. Such a system is certain to cause concerns in Russia and China and is the kind of system the ABM Treaty was intended to stop.\nThe current defense budget also requests money to begin developing a space-based missile defense system designed to intercept long-range missiles right after launch, during their boost phase and before they can deploy countermeasures. These space-based systems would be enormously expensive yet vulnerable to attack and therefore ineffective\u2014and highly destabilizing.\nAs with the decision to proceed with the GMD program, this missile defense expansion is taking place with very limited discussion and not enough assessment of the benefits and costs. The price is high. The total GMD cost is projected to reach at least $67 billion if the Pentagon fields 64 interceptors, according to a 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. An \u201caustere\u201d space-based interceptor capability would require 650 satellites and cost upward of $300 billion, says a 2012 National Research Council report. Real resources are being spent on the illusion of a defense.\nBut there is another, even more important cost: our national security. Current U.S. missile defense plans are being driven largely by technology, politics and fear. As in the past, this is happening with insufficient understanding and consideration of the limited protection these systems can realistically provide. Missile defenses will not allow us to escape our vulnerability to nuclear weapons. Instead large-scale deployments will create barriers to taking real steps toward reducing nuclear risks\u2014by blocking further cuts in nuclear arsenals and potentially spurring new deployments. This process of moving blindly and quickly ahead threatens to lead to a world filled with greater threats, not lesser ones."

We can also control our expenditures.\"\nTrump posted on social media Tuesday that it will cost Canada $61 billion US to join the Golden Dome system \"if they remain a separate, but unequal, nation,\" but will cost nothing \"if they become our cherished 51st state.\"\nMcGuinty did not engage on the $61-billion price tag, only saying the fall budget will have more details.\n\"I'm not in a position to evaluate the numbers,\" he said. \"When we bring a budget out we'll have a lot more to say about what we're going to do.\"\nTrump's renewed 51st state rhetoric came just hours after King Charles made a whirlwind trip to Ottawa, where he delivered a speech from the throne that underscored Canada's unique identity and reaffirmed its sovereignty.\nTrump's comment also seemed to counter the messaging his envoy to Ottawa, U.S. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra, has been heralding.\nJust last week he told CBC's The House that the annexation saga is \"over.\"\n\"Move on. If the Canadians want to keep talking about it \u2014 that's their business,\" he said.\n\"I'm not talking about it. Donald Trump is not talking about it.\"\n'A bribe is a bribe': MP\nOther Liberal MPs balked at the annexation comments on their way into the meeting ahead of the session's first question period.\n\"It's outrageous,\" Winnipeg West MP Doug Eyolfson said on his way into a caucus meeting on the hill.\n\"A bribe is a bribe to become the 51st state. And Canada won't take a bribe.\"\nHumber River-Black Creek Liberal MP Judy Sgro said Trump doesn't even know the real cost of the project and is trying to stir the pot.\n\"I think he's just like a little kid \u2026 who just likes to see how much trouble he can cause for his family.\"\nConservative MP Michael Barrett said the United States is still an ally and an important trading partner.\n\"It's time to move past what can only be described as a joke and get on with productive discussions between mature nations on an important trading and military partnership,\" said the Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands-Rideau Lakes representative.\n'Do what's right for Canadians': minister\nThe Golden Dome plan, inspired by the Iron Dome that protects Israel from rockets, would greatly expand the U.S. air defence system.\nTrump and other U.S. officials say the dome would be able to block missiles fired from other countries and from space, weaving together existing technologies with future tech that does not yet exist.\nThe president has said it would cost $175 billion US, although the Congressional Budget Office has said it could cost closer to $542 billion US.\nTrump's Tuesday post claimed that Canada is \"considering the offer\" to join.\nIn response, a spokesperson with the Prime Minister's Office said federal government officials are discussing security-related issues with the U.S., including the Golden Dome and the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD).\nPrime Minister Mark Carney whizzed past reporters Wednesday, saying he won't negotiate in public. Carney told Trump in a highly publicized Oval Office meeting that Canada is not for sale.\n\"We're going to continue to do what's right for Canadians and that includes making sure that we are secure, that we are sovereign,\" said McGuinty.\n\"And we're going to continue to manage our relationship with not just the United States, but as we heard the prime minister say yesterday, with the European Union.\"\nOn Tuesday, Carney told CBC's Power & Politics in an interview that he hopes Canada will be able to join ReArm Europe, a major defence procurement pact, by July 1, in a step to reduce the country's dependence on the United States for weapons and munitions.\nThat plan foresees European countries spending $1.25 trillion on defence over the next five years.\nWith files from Murray Brewster and Kevin Maimann"

      "text": "The search for extraterrestrial life is targeting Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Europa\nNASA\u2019s Europa Clipper mission will travel to one of Jupiter's largest moons to look for evidence of conditions that could support life.\nWe've known of Europa\u2019s existence for more than four centuries, but for most of that time, Jupiter\u2019s fourth-largest moon was just a pinprick of light in our telescopes\u2014a bright and curious companion to the solar system\u2019s resident giant. Over the last few decades, however, as astronomers have scrutinized it through telescopes and six spacecraft have flown nearby, a new picture has come into focus. Europa is nothing like our moon.\nObservations suggest that its heart is a ball of metal and rock, surrounded by a vast saltwater ocean that contains more than twice as much water as is found on Earth. That massive sea is encased in a smooth but fractured blanket of cracked ice, one that seems to occasionally break open and spew watery plumes into the moon\u2019s thin atmosphere.\nFor these reasons, Europa has captivated planetary scientists interested in the geophysics of alien worlds. All that water and energy\u2014and hints of elements essential for building organic molecules \u2014point to another extraordinary possibility. In the depths of its ocean, or perhaps crowded in subsurface lakes or below icy surface vents, Jupiter\u2019s big, bright moon could host life.\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s an ocean there, everywhere,\u201d says Bob Pappalardo, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \u201cEssentially everywhere on Earth that there\u2019s water, there\u2019s life. Could there be life on Europa?\u201d\nPappalardo has been at the forefront of efforts to send a craft to Europa for more than two decades. Now his hope is finally coming to fruition: later this year, NASA plans to launch Europa Clipper, the largest-ever craft designed to visit another planet. The $5 billion mission, scheduled to reach Jupiter in 2030, will spend four years analyzing this moon to determine whether it could support life. It will be joined after two years by the European Space Agency\u2019s Juice, which launched last year and is similarly designed to look for habitable conditions, not only on Europa but also on other mysterious Jovian moons.\nNeither mission will beam back a definitive answer to the question of extraterrestrial life. \u201cUnless we get really lucky, we\u2019re not going to be able to tell if there is life there, but we can find out if all the conditions are right for life,\u201d says planetary geologist Louise Prockter at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, a co-investigator on the Clipper camera team.\n\u201cEssentially everywhere on Earth that there\u2019s water, there\u2019s life. Could there be life on Europa?\u201d\nBob Pappalardo, planetary scientist, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nWhat these spacecraft will do is get us closer than ever before to answers, by identifying the telltale chemical, physical, and geological signatures of habitability\u2014whether a place is a suitable environment for life to emerge and thrive.\nThe payoff for confirming these signs on Europa would be huge. Not because humans could settle on its surface\u2014it\u2019s far too harsh and rugged and cold and irradiated for our delicate bodies\u2014but because it could justify future exploration to land there and look for alien life-forms. Finding something, anything, living on Europa would offer strong evidence for an alternate path through which life could emerge. It would mean that life on Earth is not exceptional. We\u2019d know that we have neighbors close by\u2014even if they\u2019re microbial, which would be the most likely life-form\u2014and that would make it very likely that we have neighbors elsewhere in the cosmos.\n\u201cWith the prospects of life\u2014the prospects of vast oceans\u2014within reach, you just have to go,\u201d says Nicholas Makris, director of MIT\u2019s Center for Ocean Engineering, who uses acoustics and other innovative methods to observe and explore big bodies of water. He once led a team of scientists who proposed a mission to land a spacecraft on Europa and use sound waves to explore what lies beneath the ice; he still hopes to see a lander go there one day. \u201cYou have to find out. Everyone wants to know,\u201d he says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone who doesn\u2019t want to know.\u201d\nFrom a spot in the sky to a dynamic moon\nLong before it became the cosmic destination of the year, Europa played an outsize role in transforming our understanding of the solar system. That began with its discovery, when one night in January 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei fixed his occiale\u2014an ingenious homemade telescope\u2014on Jupiter and noted three bright little dots near the side of the gas giant.\nGalileo assumed it was an illusion, that they were distant stars that only appeared to be close. But the next night, he observed those same three bright little stars now on the other side of the planet. Further observations revealed yet another bright light, also wandering nearby but refusing to leave Jupiter\u2019s side. In a short treatise called Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), published in March 1610, Galileo reported that he\u2019d found four worlds orbiting Jupiter, similar to how Mercury and Venus orbit the sun. (Astronomers still regard Jupiter and its satellites as a kind of mini solar system.) Galileo named the worlds I, II, III, etc., and referred to them as the \u201cMedicean planets,\u201d though they\u2019re now called the \u201cGalilean moons.\u201d His discovery was the first time scientists had directly observed small worlds orbiting something other than Earth or the sun, giving strong evidence to the argument, still controversial at the time, that planets circled the sun and not the other way around.\nNaming rights for these four Jovian moons ultimately went to the German astronomer Simon Marius, who claimed (but couldn\u2019t prove) that he\u2019d actually discovered them a few weeks before Galileo. In 1614, on a suggestion from Johannes Kepler, Marius proposed naming the moons Io, Callisto, Europa, and Ganymede\u2014after four \u201cirregular loves\u201d pursued by Zeus (Jupiter) in ancient mythology. It took 200 years for those names to gain widespread adoption, but they were definitely an upgrade. Had Galileo\u2019s naming scheme stuck, you\u2019d now be reading about the \u201cII Clipper,\u201d which doesn\u2019t have the same ring.\nThese moons were only the first to be discovered orbiting Jupiter. As of December 2023, astronomers had officially confirmed the existence of 91 others\u2014and there are likely many more. Where the first four are round and follow stately, simple orbits, the more recent discoveries are more diverse. Some orbit in erratic swarms or go the opposite way around; some were asteroids captured in passing; others resulted from collisions. There are so many objects around Jupiter, in fact, that the International Astronomical Union no longer confers names on Jovian satellites unless they\u2019re deemed to have significant scientific value.\nThe more we\u2019ve learned about Europa, the more fascinating it has become. For centuries, it was little more than a spot appearing to move from one side of Jupiter to the other. But by the early 20th century, stargazers had made reasonable estimates of Europa\u2019s diameter and mass (revealing that it was slightly smaller than Mercury or Earth\u2019s moon, but larger than Pluto). They\u2019d also studied the light reflecting from its surface and found that Europa was unexpectedly bright. Were it to replace our moon in the night sky, Europa would be a little smaller but shine five times brighter.\nIn the 1950s, when scientists began regarding distant objects not as bright cosmic curiosities but as real worlds, each with a distinct origin story, they began to ask questions about composition and formation. In The Planets, a book published in 1952, the astronomer Harold Urey suggested that water ice was abundant in the outer solar system because the bodies there formed far from the sun and never became warm enough for their ice to evaporate. By the 1960s, astronomers and astrophysicists had begun to speculate, partly on the basis of early measurements of its infrared spectrum, that Europa\u2019s extraordinary reflectance was indeed due to the presence of ice. But proving it was difficult.\nStephen Ridgway, now an astronomer at the National Science Foundation\u2019s NOIRLab in Tucson, Arizona, first heard about the problem of potentially icy moons in the outer solar system in the early 1970s, as a graduate student. Carl Pilcher, a postdoctoral researcher he\u2019d met at a conference, told him about it. \u201cWe think they should have ice on them because they\u2019re cold and reflective, but is it water? Is it carbon dioxide ice? Is it some other kind, or some mixture?\u201d Ridgway recalls him asking.\nIt turned out that Ridgway, who describes himself as a tinkerer as well as a physicist, was well positioned to answer those questions. Using an old mathematical trick, he had devised an innovative instrument that could capture the spectrum of a distant light source, and he was using it during nighttime observations at a telescope at Kitt Peak Observatory, in Arizona. Every element and molecule absorbs and emits a unique collection of wavelengths of energy, and astronomers can read these spectra as fingerprints that reveal the composition of cosmic bodies. Pilcher suggested that he use the instrument to observe Europa.\nThey thought it would take a week to get a useful spectrum of one of Jupiter\u2019s moons. \u201cI went and got it in one night, maybe two,\u201d Ridgway recalls. Ridgway showed the data to Pilcher, who showed it to his advisor, Tom McCord. Their analyses, published in Science in December 1972, suggested that water ice covered at least half, and possibly all, of the surface of Europa. (They also confirmed that the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto, both of which are larger than Europa, also had ice on their surfaces.)\nIn a 1980 paper, scientists reported that Europa looked \u201ccracked like a broken eggshell\u201d and compared it to a white pool ball fouled by a felt-tip pen.\nOne year later, the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which had launched in March 1972, passed close enough to Europa to take a photo. The grainy image was provocative enough to justify sending Pioneer 11\u2014which launched in 1973\u2014to swing by on its way to Saturn and then out of the solar system.\nBut Europa really started to come into focus in 1979, after the Voyager 2 spacecraft sped past the moon on July 9. (Voyager 1 also passed near Europa, but Voyager 2 had better photos.) The photographs the spacecraft beamed back revealed a smooth, bright surface, crisscrossed by long linear marks and low ridges; they might have been cracks or cliffs. In a 1980 NASA paper describing the observation, scientists reported that Europa looked \u201ccracked like a broken eggshell\u201d and compared it to a white pool ball fouled by a felt-tip pen. A 1983 Nature paper fueled interest in Europa by proposing that those features were consistent with liquid water and regular resurfacing, like the work of a natural Zamboni machine.\nThe Galileo mission, which launched in 1989 to study Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and the composition of Europa and other moons, encountered complications: the spacecraft\u2019s primary antenna neglected to extend, which severely limited the data that could be transmitted to Earth.\nBut what did come back, after Galileo reached the system in 1995, further highlighted the moon\u2019s extraordinary features and continues to energize scientists. \u201cWe have a lot of tantalizing glimpses of things,\u201d Prockter says.\nAmong other things, Galileo\u2019s magnetometer revealed a wildly varying magnetic field. Ice is a poor conductor, but liquid salt water isn\u2019t, and Europa\u2019s magnetic oscillations pointed to something moving beneath the surface. Its readings fit the idea of a global ocean being pushed, pulled, and heated by the tidal forces of Jupiter and its moon companions. They also lined up with earlier theoretical predictions of liquid water near the surface of icy moons. \u201cWe are pretty certain there\u2019s an ocean there,\u201d Prockter says, \u201cbut there is a chance that it might be something really exotic we don\u2019t understand.\u201d The only way to know for sure, she says, is to go back.\nOther images from Galileo confirmed what telescope observations had long suggested: that Europa sports a youthful appearance despite its advanced age. It likely formed at the same time as Jupiter and the rest of the solar system, about 4.5 billion years ago, yet its surface\u2014as dated by the oldest craters\u2014is less than 100 million years old. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time for us mere mortals,\u201d says Prockter, \u201cbut in geological terms, it was born yesterday. The surface is very, very young.\u201d The cracks and crevices on Europa suggest that giant ice plates on its surface collide, break apart, shove under and over each other, and refreeze.\nThe longer scientists stared at Europa, the more mysteries emerged\u2014like the questions around those ubiquitous dark ridges, often in pairs, that splatter the surface like a Jackson Pollock painting. Theorists have been busy devising explanations. Perhaps they\u2019re made by ice volcanoes or geysers, or cracks where liquid water from subsurface pools rose, froze, and crumbled as the opening closed again. Maybe they resulted from subduction, which occurs on Earth in plate tectonics, as one giant sheet of ice slid and crumpled under another. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of different models for forming those landforms, but we really don\u2019t know how they form,\u201d Prockter says. \u201cPart of the reason is that geology is based on Earth geology, but it\u2019s not like Earth.\u201d\nOne particularly striking image of Europa, captured in September 2022 by a camera on the Juno spacecraft, which is currently exploring Jupiter, reveals many of the features that are driving scientists to want to take a closer look. It shows the side of Europa that always faces Jupiter, bathed in sunlight. The moon\u2019s surface is covered with cracks, streaks, and ridges where water may rise from the ocean beneath, or where irradiated surface material may sink lower. It also shows the \u201cchaos terrains\u201d\u2014remarkably messy areas suggesting that giant pieces of ice have broken off, moved around, and refrozen, bolstering the case for geological activity similar to plate tectonics on Earth.\nHowever, Juno\u2019s brief two-hour flyby failed to answer questions about how those features formed or to confirm the existence of a buried ocean. For planetary scientists and astrophysicists, Clipper\u2019s data can help fill in the missing knowledge. It will also push our relationship with Europa into new, unexplored territory.\nWhat all those previous missions did do was help build enthusiasm for the plan to get to Europa, a plan that has evolved dramatically over the last 20 years. Originally, scientists wanted orbiters and landers, and NASA and ESA were working together on a joint mission with multiple spacecraft. Those plans fizzled, but in 2013\u2014as a result of the 2011 Decadal Survey, a report that sets the priorities for space exploration for the next 10 years\u2014NASA approved a plan to send an orbiter. By 2015, the agency had selected the instruments on board. Independently, the ESA moved forward with its own mission, with a broader goal of studying Jupiter\u2019s icy moons.\n\u201cThe Voyager mission transformed Europa from a light in the sky to a geologic world, and then the Galileo mission did the transformation to an ocean world,\u201d says Diana Blaney, a JPL geophysicist who leads the Clipper team charged with using a mapping image spectrometer to identify molecules on Europa\u2019s surface. \u201cHopefully, Clipper will bring the transformation to a habitable world.\u201d\nGetting in close\nResearchers have long searched for signs of habitability in the solar system. Landers and rovers on Mars have found evidence of liquid water, mostly long gone, and organic molecules, which contain carbon, often in chains or rings. The building blocks of biological organisms\u2014including nucleic acids and proteins\u2014all contain carbon, which is why scientists get excited when they find organic molecules. Their presence could indicate that it\u2019s possible for the precursors of life to form.\nBut it\u2019s not enough just to have promising pieces in place. Any alien species would also have to find a way to grow and survive. That far from the sun, photosynthesis is likely impossible. Organisms would necessarily be fueled by chemical energy, much as microbial extremophiles near the black smokers and hydrothermal vents on the seafloor live off the minerals and methane.\nThe possibility for Europan life is at the mercy of the moon\u2019s geophysics, says Lynnae Quick, a planetary geophysicist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. In fact, she argues that you can\u2019t have one without the other. Europa seems to host the necessary ingredients for life. But ingredients alone, on Europa as in the kitchen, won\u2019t spontaneously combine in the right way on their own. Other forces have to intervene: the moon needs to shift and squeeze, with heat, to mix the minerals from the seafloor with the salt water and any irradiated particles that seep down from the icy surface. \u201cWe need something to stir the pot, and I think the geophysical processes do that,\u201d says Quick, whose graduate work on cryovolcanism in alien worlds led to her recruitment to join Clipper. She\u2019s particularly excited about the possibility of finding pockets of warm salty water, trapped just beneath the surface, that could be abodes for life.\n\u201cEuropa is my favorite body in the solar system,\u201d Quick confesses. But she notes that other ocean worlds also offer promising places to look for signs of life. Those include Enceladus, a small moon of Saturn that, like Europa, has an icy crust with an ocean beneath. Images from the Cassini mission in 2005 revealed that geysers on the south pole of Enceladus spew water and organic molecules into space, feeding Saturn\u2019s outermost ring.\nHowever, Europa is bigger than Enceladus and is more likely to have a surface covered in icy plates that move in a way similar to Earth\u2019s plate tectonics. This sort of activity would help combine the ingredients for life. Ganymede, another Jovian moon and the solar system\u2019s largest, also likely has a liquid ocean, but sandwiched between two ice layers; without an interface between water and minerals, life is less probable. Other possible places to look include Titan, Saturn\u2019s biggest moon, which also probably hides a liquid-water ocean beneath an ice crust. (Quick is an investigator on Dragonfly, a mission to explore Titan, scheduled to launch in 2028.)\nTo look for the signs and signals of habitability, Clipper will use nine primary instruments. These will take pictures of the surface, look for water plumes, use ground-penetrating radar to measure the icy shell and search for the ocean below, and take precise measurements of the magnetic field.\nThe spacecraft will pass close enough to the moon to sample its thin atmosphere, and it will use mass spectrometry to identify molecules in the gases it finds there. Another instrument will enable scientists to analyze dust from the surface that has been kicked into the atmosphere by meteorite collisions. With any luck, they\u2019ll be able to tell if that dust originated from below\u2014from the enclosed ocean or subsurface lakes trapped in the ice\u2014or from above, as fragments that migrated from the violent volcanoes on the nearby moon Io. Either scenario would be interesting to planetary geologists, but if the molecules were organic and came from below, they would help build the case that life could exist there.\nESA\u2019s Juice mission has a similar suite of instruments, and scientists from the two teams meet regularly to plan for ways to jointly exploit the data when it starts coming in\u2014five or six years from now. \u201cThis is really very good for scientists in the planetary community,\u201d says Lorenzo Bruzzone, a telecommunications engineer at the University of Trento who leads the Juice mission\u2019s radar tool team. He\u2019s long been involved in efforts to get to Europa and the rest of the Jovian system.\nBecause Juice will visit the other ocean-bearing Galilean moons, Bruzzone says, data from that mission can be combined with Clipper\u2019s to generate a more comprehensive picture of the geological processes and potential habitability of all the ocean worlds. \u201cWe can analyze the differences in subsurface geology to better understand the evolution of the Jupiter system,\u201d he says. Those differences may help explain, for example, why three of the Galilean moons formed as icy worlds while the fourth, Io, became a volcanic hellscape.\nJupiter\u2019s radiation has the potential to interfere with every measurement, turning a meaningful signal into a mess of digital snow, like static on a television screen.\nTo make sure those instruments work when they get there, engineers and designers for both missions have had to contend with a raft of challenges. Many of them revolve around energy: Europa receives less than 5% as much sunlight as Earth. Clipper addresses the problem with gargantuan solar panels, which will span 30 meters when fully extended. (An earlier proposal for a mission to Europa included nuclear batteries, but that idea was expensive, and it was ultimately scrapped.)\nIn addition, Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field is more than 10,000 times more powerful than Earth\u2019s, accelerating already-energetic particles around the planet to create an intense radiation environment. The radiation has the potential to interfere with every measurement\u2014turning a meaningful signal into a mess of digital snow, like static on a television screen\u2014and can threaten the integrity of the instruments.\nTo slow the accumulation of radiation damage, Clipper won\u2019t orbit Europa when it reaches the moon in 2030; instead, it will make about 50 flybys over four years, swooping nearer and farther from the destructive radiation field. At its closest, it will pass just 16 miles above the surface. The name points back to fast 19th-century sailing vessels, but it also describes the journey. The craft will sail past the world, over and over. In between passes, its distance from Jupiter will give it openings to transmit data back to Earth.\nThose first transmissions will have been generations\u2014if not centuries\u2014in the making. Some of the people who laid the groundwork for the mission, decades ago, have already died. Makris, at MIT, says that when scientists were first discussing how to get to Europa, he was told by Ron Greeley, a planetary geologist and NASA advisor who proposed and fiercely advocated for missions to the moon, that space travel spans generations: \u201cHe likened it to building a cathedral.\u201d Prockter notes that by the time Clipper\u2019s data comes in, she\u2019ll be in her late 60s. \u201cI will have spent my entire career on Clipper,\u201d Prockter says. Quick, at 39, is one of the youngest members of the science team.\nMany of the scientists involved in Clipper\u2014including Pappalardo, Prockter, and Quick\u2014are already planning ways to use its insights for future missions to other worlds. But it\u2019s Europa that holds the most promise, at least for the moment.\nPappalardo thrills at the prospect of finding a Europan neighborhood that might be just right for life. \u201cWhat if we find a place that\u2019s kind of an oasis, where there are hot spots or warm spots that we detect with a thermal imager?\u201d he says.\nUltimately, Pappalardo says, his hope is that Clipper finds enough evidence to make a strong case for sending a lander someday. The mission\u2019s observations could also tell scientists where to land it: \u201cThat would be a place where we\u2019d say, well, we really need to go and scoop up some of that stuff from below the surface, look at it with a microscope, put it in a mass spectrometer, and do the next step, which is to search for life.\u201d\nStephen Ornes is a science writer based in Nashville, Tennessee.\nThis article was updated to correct an erroneous figure regarding how much sunlight Europa receives.\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nWe\u2019re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body\nGLP-1 agonists like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro might benefit heart and brain health\u2014but research suggests they might also cause pregnancy complications and harm some users.\nExclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that\u2019s over 30 years old\nThe embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian \u201cembryo adoption\u201d agency.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "Trump selects concept for $175 billion \u2018Golden Dome\u2019 missile defense system\nTrump selects concept for $175 billion \u2018Golden Dome\u2019 missile defense system\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has announced the concept he wants for his future Golden Dome missile defense program \u2014 a multilayered, $175 billion system that for the first time will put U.S. weapons in space.\nSpeaking Tuesday from the Oval Office, Trump said he expects the system will be \u201cfully operational before the end of my term,\u201d which ends in 2029, and have the capability of intercepting missiles \u201ceven if they are launched from space.\u201d\nIt\u2019s likelier that the complex system may have some initial capability by that point, a U.S. official familiar with the program said.\nTrump, seated next to a poster showing the continental U.S. painted gold and with artistic depictions of missile interceptions, also announced that Gen. Michael Guetlein, who currently serves as the vice chief of space operations, will be responsible for overseeing Golden Dome\u2019s progress.\nGolden Dome is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that are able to detect and stop missiles at all four major stages of a potential attack: detecting and destroying them before a launch, intercepting them in their earliest stage of flight, stopping them midcourse in the air, or halting them in the final minutes as they descend toward a target.\nFor the last several months, Pentagon planners have been developing options \u2014 which the U.S. official described as medium, high and \u201cextra high\u201d choices, based on their cost \u2014 that include space-based interceptors. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to detail plans that have not been made public.\nThe difference in the three versions is largely based on how many satellites and sensors \u2014 and for the first time, space-based interceptors \u2014 would be purchased.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated this month that just the space-based components of the Golden Dome could cost as much as $542 billion over the next 20 years. Trump has requested an initial $25 billion for the program in his proposed tax break bill now moving through Congress.\nThe Pentagon has warned for years that the newest missiles developed by China and Russia are so advanced that updated countermeasures are necessary. Golden Dome\u2019s added satellites and interceptors \u2014 where the bulk of the program\u2019s cost is \u2014 would be focused on stopping those advanced missiles early on or in the middle of their flight.\nThe space-based weapons envisioned for Golden Dome \u201crepresent new and emerging requirements for missions that have never before been accomplished by military space organizations,\u201d Gen. Chance Saltzman, head of the U.S. Space Force, told lawmakers at a hearing Tuesday.\nChina and Russia have put offensive weapons in space, such as satellites with abilities to disable critical U.S. satellites, which can make the U.S. vulnerable to attack.\nLast year, the U.S. said Russia was developing a space-based nuclear weapon that could loiter in space for long durations, then release a burst that would take out satellites around it.\nTrump said Tuesday that he had not yet spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Golden Dome program, \u201cbut at the right time, we will,\u201d he told reporters at the White House.\nIn a joint statement earlier this month, China and Russia called the Golden Dome idea \u201cdeeply destabilizing in nature,\u201d warning it would turn \u201couter space into an environment for placing weapons and an arena for armed confrontation.\u201d\nThere is no money for the project yet, and Golden Dome overall is \u201cstill in the conceptual stage,\u201d newly confirmed Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told senators during a hearing Tuesday.\nWhile the president picked the concept he wanted, the Pentagon is still developing the requirements that Golden Dome will need to meet \u2014 which is not the way new systems are normally developed.\nThe Pentagon and U.S. Northern Command are still drafting what is known as an initial capabilities document, the U.S. official said. That is how Northern Command, which is responsible for homeland defense, identifies what it will need the system to do.\nThe U.S. already has many missile defense capabilities, such as the Patriot missile batteries that the U.S. has provided to Ukraine to defend against incoming missiles as well as an array of satellites in orbit to detect missile launches. Some of those existing systems will be incorporated into Golden Dome.\nTrump directed the Pentagon to pursue the space-based interceptors in an executive order during the first week of his presidency.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Seung Min Kim and Michelle L. Price in Washington contributed reporting."

      "text": "North Korea says US 'Golden Dome' risks 'space nuclear war'\nNorth Korea has criticised the US's plan for a futuristic \"Golden Dome\" missile shield, saying it could \"turn outer space into a potential nuclear war field\".\nThe defence system, which President Donald Trump plans to unveil by the end of his term, is aimed at countering \"next-generation\" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.\nPyongyang's foreign ministry slammed the plan as \"the height of self-righteousness [and] arrogance\", state media reported.\nIt accused Washington of being \"hell-bent... to militarise outer space\" and warned that the plan might spark \"a global nuclear and space arms race\".\nNorth Korea considers Washington an adversary and has routinely condemned joint military drills between the US and South Korea.\nPyongyang probably sees the Golden Dome as a threat that can \"significantly weaken\" its nuclear arsenal, Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP news agency.\n\"If the US completes its new missile defence programme, the North will be forced to develop alternative means to counter or penetrate it,\" he said.\nIn 2022, the North passed a law declaring itself a nuclear weapons state, and it has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years.\nEarly this year it claimed it fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead which it said \"will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region\".\nNorth Korea joins China in criticising the US's plan. Beijing said last week that it is \"seriously concerned\" about the Golden Dome, which it said has \"strong offensive implications\".\n\"The United States, in pursuing a 'US-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,\" China's foreign ministry said. \"This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability.\"\nMany analysts believe an update to the US's limited defence systems is necessary, but some warn the process of developing the Golden Dome could face technical and political challenges.\nFor one, its hefty price tag could suck up a large chunk of the US defence budget.\nAn initial sum of $25bn (\u00a318.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it could end up costing 20 times that over decades."

      "text": "Which countries have nuclear weapons?\nAt present there are 9 countries in the world that possess nuclear weapons. They are:\n- Russia\n- United States\n- China\n- France\n- United Kingdom\n- Pakistan\n- India\n- Israel\n- North Korea\nThese states have roughly 12,331 nuclear warheads, with over 9,600 in active military stockpiles, according to the Federation of Atomic Scientists' 2025 Status of the Worlds Nuclear Forces. While this is a significant decline from the approximately 70,000 warheads owned by the nuclear-armed states during the Cold War, nuclear arsenals are expected to grow over the coming decade and today\u2019s forces are vastly more capable.\nWho has the most nuclear weapons?\nRussia has the most confirmed nuclear weapons, with over 5,500 nuclear warheads. The United States follows behind with 5,044 nuclear weapons, hosted in the US and 5 other nations: Turkey, Italy, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Total nuclear warheads owned by these 2 countries alone counts for nearly 90% of nuclear weapons in the world.\nTotal number of warheads for North Korea and Israel is unconfirmed. However, it has been estimated that North Korea has enough fissile material to develop between 40-50 individual weapons, while Israel has material for up to 200, with an estimated 90 existing warheads.\nWhat does these countries having nuclear weapons mean?\nA single nuclear warhead could kill hundreds of thousands of people, with lasting and devastating humanitarian and environmental consequences. Detonating just 1 nuclear weapon alone over New York would cause an estimated 583,160 fatalities.\nCombined, China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States possess over 12,300 nuclear weapons, most of which are many times more powerful than the nuclear weapon dropped on Hiroshima. Thirty-two other states are also part of the problem, with six nations hosting nuclear weapons, and a further 28 endorsing their use.\nTactical nuclear weapons\nA tactical nuclear weapon is any weapon that\u2019s not been classified as \u201cstrategic\u201d under US- Russian arms control agreements. The Federation of American Scientists currently estimates Russian non-strategic nuclear warheads at 1,912, and U.S. non-strategic warheads at 200, including 100 deployed in five European countries. While these are often framed as \u201csmaller\u201d or \u201clow yield\u201d nuclear weapons, these warheads can have explosive yields of up to 300 kilotons, or 20 times that of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.\nThe 9 nuclear-armed states:\nIt\u2019s time to stop the madness. Join the movement.\nThe six states hosting another country's nuclear weapons:\nBelgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and T\u00fcrkiye all host U.S. nuclear weapons. The United States insists that it maintains operational control of these weapons but their stationing in these countries helps U.S. nuclear war planning. In 2023, the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, announced that Belarus is now hosting Russian tactical nuclear weapons.\nThe 28 Other Nuclear Endorsers\nTwenty-eight countries (plus the six hosts) also \"endorse\" the possession and use of nuclear weapons by allowing the potential use of nuclear weapons on their behalf as past of defence alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO).\nAll thirty-four countries that endorse nuclear weapon usage are:\nAlbania, Armenia, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, The Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and T\u00fcrkiye."

Those previous estimates appeared in studies published by CBO in 2004 and by the National Research Council (NRC) in 2012. Although launch costs are lower now, threats and U.S. policies have changed since those studies were published in ways that could increase the overall size and cost of an SBI constellation.\nBy themselves, decreases in launch costs could reduce the previous estimates of the 20-year costs of various SBI constellations by 30 percent to 40 percent, CBO finds. For the lowest-cost alternative that CBO examines here, the reduction in launch costs would cause the total estimated cost of deploying and operating the SBI constellation for 20 years to fall from $264 billion to $161 billion (in 2025 dollars). For the highest-cost alternative that CBO examines, the total estimate would fall from $831 billion to $542 billion. (The wide range of estimates among the alternatives, both before and after accounting for the reduction in launch costs, results from differing assumptions about the performance of the individual components that make up the SBI constellations.)\nAlthough launch costs are much lower today than when the previous studies were published, two major factors could lead to higher costs for space-based missile defenses than CBO and the NRC estimated earlier. First, North Korea\u2019s ICBMs have increased in number and sophistication since those studies were published. Second, a recent executive order by the President, titled The Iron Dome for America, calls for deploying a missile defense system to protect the United States not only from attacks by regional adversaries (ones with limited capabilities, such as North Korea) but also from attacks by peer or near-peer adversaries (ones with military capabilities similar to those of the United States). Such a defense could require a more expansive SBI capability than the systems examined in the previous studies. Quantifying those recent changes will require further analysis, which CBO is undertaking at the request of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Senate Armed Services Committee."

      "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. \u2014 The U.S. Army is looking to increase autonomy through artificial intelligence solutions to reduce the manpower needed to manage Golden Dome, President Donald Trump\u2019s desired homeland missile defense architecture, the service\u2019s program executive officer for missiles and space said this week.\nAs the Army contributes a large portion of the in-development air and missile defense architecture for Guam, it is looking to adapt those capabilities for a Golden Dome application, Maj. Gen. Frank Lozano told Defense News in an interview at Redstone Arsenal on Wednesday amid the Association of the U.S. Army\u2019s Global Force Symposium in Huntsville, Alabama.\nSome of the Army\u2019s major contributions to the Guam Defense System include new modernized radars, an emerging Indirect Fire Protection Capability and its new Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is three things,\u201d Lozano said. \u201cWe\u2019re wanting to integrate more AI-enabled fire control so that will help us reduce the manpower footprint. We\u2019re wanting to create more remotely operated systems so that we don\u2019t have to have so many operators and maintainers associated with every single piece of equipment that\u2019s out there.\u201d\nAnd, he said, \u201cWe need to have more autonomously operated systems.\u201d\nCurrently, the Army typically has a launcher with a missile and a launcher crew consisting of at least two to three soldiers.\n\u201cIn the Golden Dome application, we would likely either have containerized missiles \u2014 think box of rockets \u2014 or we might actually put rockets and missiles in the ground,\u201d Lozano said. Those systems would require less frequent upkeep, as a smaller manpower footprint means status checks might only happen every couple of weeks, and test checks would be conducted remotely, he said.\nIn order to work on such capability, the Army is planning to use what it learns from maturing the Guam Defense System, which will become operational in roughly 2027 with Army assets. The service will also pivot its Integrated Fires Test Campaign, or IFTC, from a focus on testing the Guam architecture incrementally to how to inject autonomy and AI into those systems for Golden Dome beyond 2026.\nThe IFTC in 2026 is considered the Guam Defense System \u201cSuper Bowl,\u201d Lozano said. Then, beyond 2027, he said, \u201cIf we\u2019re called upon to support Golden Dome initiatives, we need to have those advanced AI, remotely operated, autonomous-based formations and systems ready to go.\u201d\nTo begin, the Army will be focused on defining the functions that human operators perform at all the operator terminals within an IBCS-integrated fire control center or at a particular launching station, Lozano said.\nOnce those functions are defined, Lozano said, the Army will have to define the data sources that drive action.\n\u201cWe have to create the decision rubric that assesses and analyzes that data that then drives a human decision, and then we have to code AI algorithms to be able to process that information and make the right decision,\u201d Lozano said. \u201cThere will be trigger points where the software has to say, \u2018I\u2019m not authorized to make that level of decision. It\u2019s got to go back to the human and deliver.\u2019\u201d\nFor the first time, the Army\u2019s Program Executive Office Missiles and Space is interacting with many new market entrants in the AI realm to work on the effort.\nFor example, Lozano said he met this week at the Global Force Symposium with the French defense firm Safran. Safran, known for its assured position, navigation and timing capabilities, is planning a significant U.S. expansion.\nThe defense firm provides capability for various Army missile programs, including Patriot air and missile defense systems and IBCS, as well as Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System and Precision Strike Missile programs.\nLozano told the company he is looking for ways to reduce humans having to perform actions, such as verifying that timing data is synchronized with satellite timing.\nThe Army has also begun discussions with Anduril, which, in early January, acquired the U. S. defense company Numerica, which happens to write the Army\u2019s IBCS fire control software. The service has discussed with Anduril how it can start looking at integrating more AI fire control functionality into its major air and missile defense command-and-control system.\nPart of the plan is focused on engaging with some nontraditional industry, such as venture capitalists and newly established small companies tackling these challenges, according to Lozano.\nThe Army will spend the next six to nine months defining what it wants to look for from industry and then will begin hosting industry days and issuing requests for information, he said.\nJen Judson is an award-winning journalist covering land warfare for Defense News.

      "text": "The Biggest Questions: Are we alone in the universe?\nScientists are training machine-learning models and designing instruments to hunt for life on other worlds.\nIn 1977, the New York Times published an article titled \u201cSeeking an End to Cosmic Loneliness,\u201d describing physicists\u2019 attempts to pick up radio messages from aliens. The endeavor, known as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), was still in its early stages, and its proponents were struggling to persuade their peers and Congress that the idea was worth funding.\nThe quest to determine if anyone or anything is out there has gained greater scientific footing in the nearly half-century since that article\u2019s publication. Back then, astronomers had yet to spot a single planet outside our solar system. Now we know the galaxy is teeming with a diversity of worlds. Our planet\u2019s oceans were once considered exceptional, whereas evidence today suggests that numerous moons in the outer solar system host subsurface waters.\nOur notion of the range of environments where life could exist has also expanded thanks to the discovery on Earth of extremophile organisms that can thrive in places far hotter, saltier, acidic, and more radioactive than previously thought possible, including creatures living around undersea hydrothermal vents.\nWe\u2019re now getting closer than ever before to learning how common living worlds like ours actually are. New tools, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, could help scientists look past their preconceived notions of what constitutes life. Future instruments will sniff the atmospheres of distant planets and scan samples from our local solar system to see if they contain telltale chemicals in the right proportions for organisms to prosper.\n\u201cI think within our lifetime we will be able to do it,\u201d says Ravi Kopparapu, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. \u201cWe will be able to know if there is life on other planets.\u201d\nWhile humans have a long history of speculating about distant worlds, for much of that time actual evidence was in short supply. The first planets around other stars\u2014known as exoplanets\u2014were discovered in the early 1990s, but it took until the launch of NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope in 2009 for astronomers to understand how common they were. Kepler carefully monitored hundreds of thousands of stars, looking for tiny dips in their brightness that could indicate planets passing in front of them. The mission helped the number of known exoplanets rise from a mere handful to over 5,500.\nKepler was built to help determine the prevalence of Earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars at the right distance to have liquid water on their surface (a region often nicknamed the Goldilocks zone). While not a single extraterrestrial world has been a perfect twin of our own so far, researchers can use the sheer quantity of discoveries to make educated guesses as to how many might be out there. The current best estimates suggest that anywhere between 10% and 50% of sun-like stars have planets like ours, leading to numbers that make astronomers\u2019 heads swim.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s 50%, that\u2019s bonkers, right?\u201d says Jessie Christiansen, an astrophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California. \u201cThere are billions of sun-like stars in the galaxy, and if half of them have Earth-like planets, there could be billions of habitable rocky planets.\u201d\nIs there anybody home?\nDetermining whether these planets actually contain organisms is no easy task. Researchers must capture the faint light from an exoplanet and spread it into its constituent wavelengths, scanning for signatures that indicate the presence and amount of different types of chemicals. While astronomers would like to focus on sun-like stars, doing so is technically challenging. NASA\u2019s mighty new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is currently training its 6.5-meter mirror and unparalleled infrared instruments on worlds around stars smaller, cooler, and redder than our sun, known as M dwarfs. Such places might be habitable, but at the moment, nobody is really sure.\nFor liquid water to be present on their surfaces, planets around M dwarfs would need to orbit close to their stars\u2014which tend to be more active than the sun, sending out violent flares that could strip away atmospheric gases and likely leave the ground a dry husk. JWST has been investigating Trappist-1, an M dwarf 40 light-years away with seven small rocky worlds, four of which are at the right distance to potentially have liquid water. The two closest exoplanets have already been shown to be devoid of atmospheres, but scientists are eagerly awaiting the results of JWST observations from the next three. They want to know if even those outside the habitable zone can have atmospheres.\nThere\u2019s special interest in looking for other planets around M dwarf stars, because they are far more prevalent than sun-size stars. \u201cIf they find them to hold atmospheres, that increases the habitable real estate of the galaxy a hundredfold,\u201d says Christiansen.\nOnce we\u2019ve found a planet that looks a lot like Earth, then we\u2019ll want to start hunting for chemical clues of life on its surface. JWST isn\u2019t sensitive enough to do that, but future ground-based instruments like the Extremely Large Telescope, Giant Magellan Telescope, and Thirty Meter Telescope\u2014which are expected to begin taking data in the 2030s\u2014could tease out the chemical components of nearby Earth-like worlds. Information from more distant targets will have to wait for NASA\u2019s next planned flagship mission, the space-based Habitable Worlds Observatory, expected to launch sometime in the late 2030s or early 2040s. The telescope will use either an external star shade or an instrument called a coronagraph to block the glaring light of a star and home in on dimmer planetary light and its potential molecular fingerprints.\nWhich chemicals in particular astronomers should be looking for remains a matter of debate. Ideally, they want to find what are known as biosignatures\u2014molecules like water, methane, and carbon dioxide present in amounts similar to what we find on Earth. What that means in practice isn\u2019t always clear, since our planet has gone through many periods when it contained life yet the quantities of different chemicals varied wildly.\n\u201cDo you want it to detect an Archaean Earth, like 2 or 3 billion years ago?\u201d asks Kopparapu. \u201cOr from the Neoproterozoic, where there was a snowball Earth? Or do you want to detect the current Earth, where there is a lot of free oxygen, ozone, water, and CO2?\u201d\nThere was much excitement recently when JWST spotted dimethyl sulfide, a molecule that on our world is made only by living things, on an exoplanet nearly nine times Earth\u2019s size located 120 light-years away. The results which have yet to be confirmed, highlight the trickiness of such methods. If dimethyl sulfide is truly present in the planet\u2019s atmosphere, then starlight should also break it down to form ethane, a molecule that has yet to be seen. \u201cNo single gas is a biosignature,\u201d says Kopparapu. \u201cYou need to see a combination of them.\u201d Last year, he and others in the community published a report emphasizing that any particular finding must be placed in the context of its stellar and planetary environment, since there could be many results that seemingly point to life yet have alternative explanations.\nWhy counts as life?\nThis problem\u2014how to definitively differentiate between life and non-life\u2014is a perennial one, whether you\u2019re looking at distant planets or even phenomena here on Earth. Researchers may soon receive help from algorithmic techniques that can tease out associations too complex for the human brain to fathom. In recent experiments, Robert Hazen and his colleagues took 134 living and non-living samples (including petroleum, carbon-rich meteorites, ancient fossils, and a wasp that flew into their lab), vaporized them, and spread out their chemical constituents. Roughly 500,000 different attributes were identified within each sample\u2019s molecular makeup and run through a machine-learning program.\n\u201cWhen we look at those 500,000 attributes, there are patterns that are unique to living things and patterns unique to non-living things,\u201d says Hazen, a mineralogist and astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science.\nAfter the software was trained on 70% of the specimens, the technique was able to recognize with 90% accuracy which of the remaining samples had a biological origin. The device that is used to spread out the chemical components of the samples is around seven inches long, small enough to be sent on missions to nearby ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s Europa or Saturn\u2019s Enceladus. NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover carried a similar instrument to Mars, so Hazen thinks his team\u2019s machine-learning algorithm could be adapted to sift through its data and hunt for organisms past or present there. And because it relies on molecular relationships rather than detecting specific organic chemicals like DNA or amino acids, which may not be used in other biospheres, the method could allow scientists to look for life entirely unlike what we have on Earth.\nSuch machine-learning applications are also starting to find use in SETI, which has in recent years pivoted toward looking for a broader array of visible evidence for tool-using extraterrestrial species than before. Most in the field are on the lookout for such technosignatures, defined as \u201csome remotely detectable signature of technology that we can characterize with astronomical instrumentation,\u201d says Sofia Sheikh of the SETI Institute. This could be a radio signal, but other evidence could include things like optical laser pulses, giant space-based engineering projects, atmospheric pollution, or even artificial probes that make their way to our solar system.\nAt the Zwicky Transient Facility near San Diego, California, which continuously searches the entire night sky for brief flashes of light coming from unknown sources, engineers are teaching artificial intelligence how to identify features that would not be expected from natural phenomena. \u201cIt\u2019s at that point that we can start asking questions,\u201d says Ashish Mahabal, an astronomer and data scientist at Caltech. The answers to such questions could help reveal novel astronomical events or, just maybe, a star surrounded by enormous solar panels that feed an energy-intensive alien society.\nSETI researchers hope that by using such tools, they can help overcome some of their anthropocentric biases. Most recognize that our expectations of otherworldly beings are constrained by our own experience. For example, the search for signs of massive alien solar panels is often \u201cbased on this assumption that there\u2019s always going to be an exponential need for energy,\u201d says Sheikh.\nBecause of all the avenues currently being explored, many scientists believe that answers to our questions about extraterrestrial life are not far off. Yet ultimately, the question of our cosmic loneliness is a philosophical one.\nFor most of humanity\u2019s history, we didn\u2019t believe ourselves to be alone. We filled the heavens with gods, monsters, and mythic creatures. It is only in the modern age that our species has started to worry about its place in the universe. But whether or not any other part of it harbors life, the cosmos is our home. We can choose to be lonely or to embrace the beauty and wonder all around us.\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nWe\u2019re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body\nGLP-1 agonists like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro might benefit heart and brain health\u2014but research suggests they might also cause pregnancy complications and harm some users.\nExclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that\u2019s over 30 years old\nThe embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian \u201cembryo adoption\u201d agency.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "The dream of offshore rocket launches is finally blasting off\nSea-based launches are hitting their stride. That could lead to a lot more space missions with a lot less red tape.\nWant to send something to space? Get in line. The demand for rides off Earth is skyrocketing, pushing even the busiest spaceports, like Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, to their operational limits. Orbital launches worldwide have more than doubled over the past four years, from about 100 to 250 annually. That number is projected to spiral further up this decade, fueled by an epic growth spurt in the commercial space sector.\nTo relieve the congestion, some mission planners are looking to the ocean as the next big gateway to space. China has sent more than a dozen space missions from ocean platforms since 2019, most recently in January 2025. Italy\u2019s space program has announced it will reopen its ocean launchpad off the coast of Kenya, while German space insiders envision an offshore spaceport in the North Sea. In the US, the idea of sea launches has attracted attention from heavyweights like SpaceX and inspired a new startup called the Spaceport Company.\nLaunching rockets from offshore platforms like barges or oil rigs has a number of advantages. For one thing, it dramatically expands potential locations to lift off from, especially along the equator (this provides rockets with a natural speed boost because, thanks to geometry, the equator moves faster than the poles). At the same time, it is potentially safer and more environmentally friendly, placing launches further from population centers and delicate ecosystems.\nOcean launches have taken place on and off for decades. But the renewed interest in offshore spaceports raises a host of questions about the unique regulatory, geopolitical, and environmental trade-offs of sea-based launches. It also offers a glimpse of new technologies and industries, enabled by a potentially limitless launch capacity, that could profoundly reshape our lives.\n\u201cThe best way to build a future where we have dozens, hundreds, or maybe thousands of spaceports is to build them at sea,\u201d says Tom Marotta, CEO and founder of the Spaceport Company, which is working to establish offshore launch hubs. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find a thousand acres on the coast over and over again to build spaceports. It\u2019s very easy to build the same ship over and over again.\u201d\nThe saga of sea launches\nThe vision of oceanic spaceports is almost as old as rocketry itself. The first large rocket to take off from sea was a V2, the notorious missile developed by Germany in World War II and subsequently adopted by the United States, which the US Navy launched from the aircraft carrier USS Midway south of Bermuda on September 6, 1947.\nAs it turned out, the inaugural flight was a bit of a mixed bag. Neal Casey, an 18-year-old technician stationed on the Midway, later recalled how the missile tilted dangerously starboard and headed toward the vessel\u2019s own command center, known as the island.\n\u201cI had no problem tracking the rocket,\u201d said Casey, according to the USS Midway Museum. \u201cIt almost hit the island.\u201d\nDespite this brush with disaster, the test was considered a success because it proved that launching rockets from sea platforms was technically feasible. That revelation enabled the proliferation of missile-armed vessels, like warships or submarines, that have prowled the sea ever since.\nOf course, missiles are designed to hit targets on Earth, not venture into space. But in the early 1960s Robert Truax, an American rocketry engineer, began pursuing a spectacular vision: the Sea Dragon.\nStanding nearly 500 feet tall, it would have been by far the biggest rocket in history, towering over the Apollo Program\u2019s Saturn V or SpaceX\u2019s Starship. No launchpad on land could withstand the force of its liftoff. A rocket this gargantuan could only be launched from a submerged position beneath the sea, rising out of the water like a breaching whale and leaving whirlpools swirling in its wake.\nTruax proposed this incredible idea in 1963 while he was working at the rocket and missile manufacturer Aerojet General. He was even able to test a few small prototypes, including the Sea Bee, which was fired from under the waters of San Francisco Bay. Though the Sea Dragon never became a reality, the concept captured the imaginations of space dreamers for decades; most recently, it was depicted bursting from the ocean in the Apple+ series For All Mankind.\nTruax was eerily prescient about many future trends in spaceflight, and indeed, various governments and private entities have developed offshore launch platforms to take advantage of the flexibility offered by the seas.\n\u201cThe most wanted launching sites are close to the equator,\u201d says Gerasimos Rodotheatos, an assistant professor of international law and security at the American University in the Emirates who has researched sea-based launches. \u201cMany countries there are hard to deal with because of political instability or because they don\u2019t have the infrastructure. But if you\u2019re using a platform or a vessel, it\u2019s easier to select your location.\u201d\nAnother major advantage is safety. \u201cYou\u2019re far away from cities,\u201d Rodotheatos adds. \u201cYou\u2019re far away from land. You\u2019re minimizing the risk of any accidents or any failures.\u201d\nFor these reasons, rockets have intermittently lifted off from sea for nearly 60 years, beginning with Italy's Luigi Broglio Malindi Space Center, a retrofitted oil rig off the coast of Kenya that launched orbital missions from the 1960s to the 1980s and may soon reopen after a nearly 40-year hiatus.\nSea Launch, a multinational company founded in 1995, launched dozens of missions into orbit from the LP Odyssey, another repurposed drilling rig. The company might still be in business if Russia had not annexed Crimea in 2014, a move that prompted the venture\u2014a partnership between Russia, Ukraine, the United States, and Norway\u2014to shutter later the same year.\nThe saga of Sea Launch proved that offshore launches could be commercially profitable, but it also exposed gray areas in international marine and space law. For instance, while Sea Launch was a venture between four spacefaring nations, it registered its rig and vessels to Liberia, which has been interpreted as a flag of convenience. Such strategies could present the opportunity for companies or other entities to evade certain labor laws, tax obligations, and environmental regulations.\n\u201cSome states are very strict on the nationality and transparency of ownership, and other states less strict,\u201d says Alla Pozdnakova, a professor of law at the University of Oslo\u2019s Scandinavian Institute for Maritime Law, who has researched sea-based launches. \u201cFor now, it seems that it hasn\u2019t been really that problematic because the United States, for example, would require that if you\u2019re a US citizen or a US company, then you have to apply for a license from the US space authorities, regardless of where you want to launch.\u201d\nBut if the US imposes strict oversight on launches, other nations might apply different standards to licensing agreements with launch providers. \u201cI can imagine that some unauthorized projects may become possible simply because they are on the seas and there is no real authority\u2014by contrast to land-based space launches\u2014to supervise those kinds of launches,\u201d Pozdnakova says.\nBoeing, which managed Sea Launch, was fined $10 million in 1998 by the US Department of State for allegedly sharing information about American defense technology with its foreign partners in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. In addition to the legal and national security risks posed by Sea Launch, Pacific Island nations raised concerns to the United Nations in 1999 that the company\u2019s offshore rockets could damage the environment by, for instance, creating oil slicks from unused fuel in discarded boosters.\nThe complex issues that offshore spaceports raise for international law, environmental protection, and launch access have never been more relevant. SpaceX, which is famous for pioneering offshore rocket landings, has also flirted with sea-based launches. The company went so far as to purchase two oil rigs for $3.5 million apiece in 2020. They were renamed Deimos and Phobos after the two moons of Mars.\n\u201cSpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, moon & hypersonic travel around Earth,\u201d SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on Twitter (when it was still Twitter) in 2020.\nSpaceX eventually abandoned this project and sold the rigs, though Gwynne Shotwell, its president and COO, said in 2023 that sea-based launches were likely to be part of the company\u2019s future. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe company might need to move launch operations offshore if it wants to carry through on its aspirations for Starship, which is the most powerful rocket ever developed and the keystone of SpaceX\u2019s future plans to send humans to the moon and Mars. \u201cWe have designed Starship to be as much like aircraft operations as we possibly can get it,\u201d she said at a conference in 2023, according to SpaceNews. \u201cWe want to talk about dozens of launches a day, if not hundreds of launches a day.\u201d\nThe environmental impact of launching hundreds of rockets a day, either from sea or land, is not known. While offshore launches pose fewer direct risks to local environments than land launches, very little is understood about the risks that rocket emissions and chemical pollution pose to the climate and human health at current levels, much less exponentially higher ones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to deny that launching or emitting anything further from people is usually better,\u201d says Sebastian Eastham, the senior lecturer in sustainable aviation at Imperial College London, who studies aerospace emissions and their environmental impacts. \u201cBut when we say that we're concerned about the emissions, it is incomplete to say that we\u2019re not launching near people, so people aren\u2019t going to be affected.\u201d\n\u201cI really hope that we find out that the impacts are small,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut because you have this very rapid growth in launch emissions, you can\u2019t sample now and say that this is representative of what it's going to be like in five years. We\u2019re nowhere near a steady state.\u201d\nIn other words, rocket launches have been largely overlooked as a source of greenhouse-gas emissions and air pollution, simply because they have been too rare to be considered a major contributor. As space missions ramp up around the world, experts must aim to constrain the impact on climate change, the ozone layer, and pollution from spent parts that burn up in the atmosphere.\nThe McDonald\u2019s of spaceports\nOffshore launches are almost routine in China, where companies like Galactic Energy, Orienspace, and the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation have expanded orbital liftoffs from barges. (None of these companies responded to a request for comment.)\nBut at the moment, sea-based launches are limited to small rockets that can deploy payloads of a few thousand pounds to orbit. No ocean spaceport is currently equipped to handle the world\u2019s most powerful rockets, like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy, which can deliver more than 140,000 pounds to orbit. There are also currently no public plans to invest in sea-based infrastructure for heavy-lift rockets, but that may change if smaller offshore spaceports prove to be reliable and affordable options.\n\u201cAll the activities now are based on off-the-shelf technologies,\u201d Rodotheatos says, meaning facilities like oil rigs or barges. \u201cIf one company makes an investment to design and implement a floating platform from zero, specifically fitted for that purpose, I expect to see a big change.\u201d\nTom Marotta founded the Spaceport Company in 2022 with a similar long-term vision in mind. After working both for the space company Astra and on the regulatory side at the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, Marotta observed what he calls a \u201cspaceport bottleneck\u201d that had to be addressed to keep pace with the demands of the commercial space sector.\nTo that end, the Spaceport Company procured a former US Navy training vessel, named the Once in a Lifetime after the Talking Heads song, as its first launchpad. The company is currently serving customers for suborbital space missions and missile tests, but its broader vision is to establish a network of scalable orbital spaceports across the ocean.\n\u201cWe want to be the McDonald\u2019s of spaceports, and build a model that can be repeated and copied-and-pasted all around the world,\u201d Marotta says.\nMarotta sees boundless applications for such a network. It could expand launch capacity without threatening coastal ecosystems or provoking pushback from local communities. It could serve as a reliable backup option for busy spaceports on land. It could give nations that normally don\u2019t have access to spaceflight an affordable option for their own launch services.\n\u201cMany nations want their own sovereign orbital launch capability, but they don\u2019t want to spend a billion dollars to build a launchpad that might only be used once or twice,\u201d Marotta says. \u201cWe see an opportunity there to basically give them a launchpad on demand.\u201d\nMarotta also has another dream in mind: ocean platforms could help to enable point-to-point rocket travel, capable of transporting cargo and passengers anywhere on Earth in under 90 minutes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to need dedicated and exclusive use of rockets off the coasts of major cities to serve that point-to-point rocket travel concept,\u201d Marotta says. \u201cThis is science fiction right now, but I would not be surprised if in the next five years we see [organizations], particularly the military, experimenting with point-to-point rocket cargo.\u201d\nOffshore launches currently represent a small tile in the global space mosaic, but they could dramatically change our lives in the coming decades. What that future might look like, with all of its risks and benefits, depends on the choices that companies, governments, and the public make right now.\nBecky Ferreira is a science reporter based in Ithaca, NY.

Now, it will take up the Senate-amended measure. READ MORE: What happened right before the Senate\u2019s big vote on Trump\u2019s big bill Here\u2019s the latest on what\u2019s in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate. Tax cuts are the priority Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump\u2019s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year. It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit. A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It\u2019s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. WATCH: Trump calls on GOP senators to support big policy bill, threatens Elon Musk over opposition There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House\u2019s version. Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said. Money for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump\u2019s border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year. READ MORE: What Americans think about Trump\u2019s deportations right now The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections. For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security. How to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for the poor. Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse. The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements. READ MORE: How cutting Medicaid could upend long-term care for many older Americans There\u2019s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits. Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments. But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate. A \u2018death sentence\u2019 for clean energy? Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs. Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a \u201cdeath sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.\u201d A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law. Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. Trump savings accounts and so, so much more A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities. The House and Senate both have a new children\u2019s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury. READ MORE: What experts think about the $1,000 \u2018Trump accounts\u2019 for babies The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d There\u2019s a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing. Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars. Additionally, a provision would increase the nation\u2019s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills. Last-minute changes The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote. A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals. The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China. What\u2019s the final cost? Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

At some 887 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.

      "text": "How a 30-year-old techno-thriller predicted our digital isolation\nIn Irwin Winkler\u2019s proto\u2013cyber thriller, a woman\u2019s most reliable companion is the screen in front of her.\nIn April, Mark Zuckerberg, as tech billionaires are so fond of doing these days, pontificated at punishing length on a podcast. In the interview, he addressed America\u2019s loneliness epidemic: \u201cThe average American has\u2014I think it\u2019s fewer than three friends. And the average person has demand for meaningfully more. I think it\u2019s like 15 friends or something, right?\u201d\nBefore you\u2019ve had a moment to register the ominous way in which he frames human connection in such bleak economic terms, he offers his solution to the loneliness epidemic: AI friends. Ideally AI friends his company generates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m not even me anymore.\u201d\n\u2014Angela Bennett, The Net (1995)\nThirty years ago, Irwin Winkler\u2019s proto\u2013cyber thriller, The Net, was released. It was 1995, commonly regarded as the year Hollywood discovered the internet. Sandra Bullock played a social recluse and computer nerd for hire named Angela Bennett, who unwittingly uncovers a sinister computer security conspiracy. She soon finds her life turned upside down as the conspiracists begin systematically destroying her credibility and reputation. Her job, home, finances, and very identity are seemingly erased with some judicial tweaks to key computer records.\nBennett is uniquely\u2014conveniently, perhaps\u2014well positioned for this identity annihilation. Her mother, in the throes of dementia, no longer recognizes her; she works from home for clients who have never met her; her social circle is limited to an online chat room; she orders takeout from Pizza.net; her neighbors don\u2019t even know what she looks like. Her most reliable companion is the screen in front of her. A wild, unimaginable scenario that I\u2019m sure none of us can relate to.\n\u201cJust think about it. Our whole world is sitting there on a computer. It\u2019s in the computer, everything: your DMV records, your Social Security, your credit cards, your medical records. It\u2019s all right there. Everyone is stored in there. It\u2019s like this little electronic shadow on each and every one of us, just begging for someone to screw with, and you know what? They\u2019ve done it to me, and you know what? They\u2019re gonna do it to you.\u201d\n\u2014Angela Bennett, The Net\nWhile the villain of The Net is ultimately a nefarious cybersecurity software company, the film\u2019s preoccupying fear is much more fundamental: If all of our data is digitized, what happens if the people with access to that information tamper with it? Or weaponize it against us?\nThis period of Hollywood\u2019s flirtation with the internet is often referred to as the era of the technophobic thriller, but that\u2019s a surface-level misreading. Techno-skeptic might be more accurate. These films were broadly positive and excited about new technology; it almost always played a role in how the hero saved the day. Their bigger concern was with the humans who had ultimate control of these tools, and what oversight and restrictions we should place on them.\nIn 2025, however, the most prescient part of The Net is Angela Bennett\u2019s digital alienation. What was originally a series of plausible enough contrivances to make the theft of her identity more believable is now just part of our everyday lives. We all bank, shop, eat, work, and socialize without necessarily seeing another human being in person. And we\u2019ve all been through covid lockdowns where that isolation was actively encouraged. For a whole generation of young people who lived through that, socializing face to face is not second nature. In 2023, the World Health Organization declared loneliness to be a pressing global health threat, estimating that one in four older adults experience social isolation and between 5% and 15% of adolescents experience loneliness. In the US, social isolation may threaten public health more seriously than obesity.\nThe Net appeared at a time when the internet was only faintly understood as the new Wild West \u2026 In that sense, it remains a fascinating time capsule of a moment when the possibilities to come felt endless, the outlook cautiously optimistic.\nWe also spend increasing amounts of time looking at our phones, where finely tuned algorithms aggressively lobby for more and more of our ad-revenue-generating attention. As Bennett warns: \u201cOur whole lives are on the computer, and they knew that I could be vanished. They knew that nobody would care, that nobody would understand.\u201d In this sense, in 2025 we are all Angela Bennett. As Bennett\u2019s digital alienation makes her more vulnerable to pernicious actors, so too are we increasingly at risk from those who don\u2019t have, and have never had, our best interests at heart.\nTo blame technology entirely for a rise in loneliness\u2014as many policymakers are doing\u2014would be a mistake. While it is unquestionably playing a part in exacerbating the problem, its outsize role in our lives has always reflected larger underlying factors. In Multitudes: How Crowds Made the Modern World (2024), the journalist Dan Hancox examines the ways in which crowds have been demonized and othered by those in power and suggests that our alienation is much more structural: \u201cWhether through government cuts or concessions to the expansive ambitions of private enterprise, a key reason we have all become a bit more crowd-shy in recent decades is the prolonged, top-down assault on public space and the wider public realm\u2014what are sometimes called the urban commons. From properly funded libraries to pleasant, open parks and squares, free or affordable sports and leisure facilities, safe, accessible and cheap public transport, comfortable street furniture and free public toilets, and a vibrant, varied, uncommodified social and cultural life\u2014all the best things about city life fall under the heading of the public realm, and all of them facilitate and support happy crowds rather than sad, alienated, stay-at-home loners.\u201d\nNearly half a century ago Margaret Thatcher laid out the neoliberal consensus that would frame the next decades of individualism: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look after themselves first.\u201d\nIn keeping with that philosophy, social connectivity has been outsourced to tech companies for which the attention economy is paramount. \u201cThe Algo\u201d is our new, capricious god. If your livelihood depends on engagement, the temptation is to stop thinking about human connection when you post, and to think more about what will satisfy The Algo to ensure a good harvest.\nHow much will you trust an AI chatbot powered by Meta to be your friend? Answers to this may vary. Even if you won\u2019t, other people are already making close connections with \u201cAI companions\u201d or \u201cfalling in love\u201d with ChatGPT. The rise of \u201ccognitive offloading\u201d\u2014of people asking AI to do their critical thinking for them\u2014is already well underway, with many high school and college students admitting to a deep reliance on the technology.\nBeyond the obvious concern that AI \u201cfriends\u201d are hallucinating, unthinking, obsequious algorithms that will never challenge you in the way a real friend might, it\u2019s also worth remembering who AI actually works for. Recently Elon Musk\u2019s own AI chatbot, Grok, was given new edicts that caused it to cast doubt on the Holocaust and talk about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in response to unrelated prompts\u2014a reminder, if we needed it, that these systems are never neutral, never apolitical, and always at the command of those with their hands on the code.\nI\u2019m fairly lucky. I live with my partner and have a decent community of friends. But I work from home and can spend the majority of the day not talking to anyone. I\u2019m not immune to feeling isolated, anxious, and powerless as I stare unblinking at my news feed. I think we all feel it. We are all Angela Bennett. Weaponizing that alienation, as the antagonists of The Net do, can of course be used for identity theft. But it can also have much more deleterious applications: Our loneliness can be manipulated to make us consume more, work longer, turn against ourselves and each other. AI \u201cfriendships,\u201d if engaged with uncritically, are only going to supercharge this disaffection and the ways in which it can be abused.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can withhold our attention, practice healthier screen routines, limit our exposure to doomscrolling, refuse to engage with energy-guzzling AI, delete our accounts. But, crucially, we can also organize collectively IRL: join a union or a local club, ask our friends if they need to talk. Hopelessness is what those in power want us to feel, so resist it.\nThe Net appeared at a time when the internet was only faintly understood as the new Wild West. Before the dot-com boom and bust, before Web 2.0, before the walled gardens and the theory of a \u201cdead internet.\u201d In that sense, it remains a fascinating time capsule of a moment when the possibilities to come felt endless, the outlook cautiously optimistic.\nWe can also see The Net\u2019s influence in modern screen-life films like Searching, Host, Unfriended, and The Den. But perhaps\u2014hopefully\u2014its most enduring legacy will be inviting us to go outside, touch grass, talk to another human being, and organize.\n\u201cFind the others.\u201d\n\u2014Douglas Rushkoff, Team Human (2019)\nTom Humberstone is a comic artist and illustrator based in Edinburgh.\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nWe\u2019re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body\nGLP-1 agonists like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro might benefit heart and brain health\u2014but research suggests they might also cause pregnancy complications and harm some users.\nExclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that\u2019s over 30 years old\nThe embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian \u201cembryo adoption\u201d agency.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including my authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States.\nPresident Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective defense against nuclear attacks, and while this program resulted in many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal could be realized. And since the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and initiated development of limited homeland missile defense, official United States homeland missile defense policy has remained only to stay ahead of rogue-nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches.\nOver the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities.\nSec. 2. Policy. To further the goal of peace through strength, it is the policy of the United States that:\n(a) The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield;\n(b) The United States will deter \u2014 and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against \u2014 any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland; and\n(c) The United States will guarantee its secure second-strike capability.\nSec. 3. Implementation. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall:\n(a) Submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield.

      "text": "\u201cFor half a century, ACA has been providing the world \u2026 with advocacy, analysis, and awareness on some of the most critical topics of international peace and security, including on how to achieve our common, shared goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.\u201d\nCongress has appropriated over $250 billion for the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s programs between fiscal years 1985 and 2023, according to calculations by ACA based on Missile Defense Agency (MDA) estimates and the legislative record. That total does not include spending by the military services on programs such as the Patriot system or the many additional tens of billions of dollars spent since work on anti-missile systems first began in the 1950s.\nFor nearly two decades, U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) policy has sought to protect the homeland against limited long-range missile strikes from states such as Iran and North Korea, but not major nuclear powers like Russia and China as that mission would pose significant technical, financial, and geopolitical challenges. The United States has also pursued programs to defend U.S. troops and facilities abroad, as well as some close allies, from attacks by ballistic missiles\u2014and to a much lesser extent cruise missiles.\nThe overall U.S. missile defense effort enjoys strong bipartisan support in Congress. Additionally, many U.S. allies place a high value on missile defense cooperation with the United States.\nHowever, the U.S. pursuit of effective missile defenses has been accompanied by intense debate about the technical capabilities of the system and realism of testing, the scope of the ballistic missile threat, the deterrence and assurance benefits of defenses, the cost-effectiveness of shooting down relatively inexpensive offensive missiles with expensive defensive ones, and the repercussions for U.S. strategic stability with Russia and China.\nAccording to the Defense Department\u2019s independent testing office, existing U.S. missile defenses have \"demonstrated capability\" to defend the U.S. homeland against a small number of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) threats that employ \"simple countermeasures.\" The testing office assesses that defenses to protect allies and U.S. troops deployed abroad possess a capability to defend against small numbers of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs). The capability of defenses against short-range ballistic missiles is limited to the threat posed by a \u201crepresentative raid.\u201d\nUntil recently, the only U.S. BMD system to ever be used in combat was the point-defense Patriot system. In April 2024, U.S. Navy ships in the Middle East equipped with the Aegis BMD system intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles inbound toward Israel, using the SM-3 interceptor.\nLeaders of the U.S. missile defense enterprise have increasingly voiced concerns that the current U.S. approach to national and regional missile defense is unsustainable and that existing defenses must be augmented with emerging capabilities to reduce the cost of missile defense and keep pace with advancing adversary missile threats.\nRecent Policy Shifts\nUnder the Trump and Biden administrations, the ambitions of U.S. missile defense policy have expanded while funding has remained roughly flat at approximately $10 billion in Congressional appropriations each fiscal year.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2019 Missile Defense Review argued the need for an improved capability to intercept cruise and hypersonic missiles, including long-range strikes targeting the continental United States. The Biden administration\u2019s 2022 Missile Defense Review acknowledged these concerns. The Missile Defense Agency is managing several new programs to improve hypersonic missile defense, such as the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor and the Glide-Phase Interceptor. U.S. Northern Command and the MDA have done limited tests and studies on improving homeland defense against cruise missiles.\nOther aspects of the Trump administration\u2019s missile defense policy have been set aside by the Biden administration\u2019s 2022 review, however. These include endorsements of boost-phase interceptors, space-based interceptors, and adapting the sea-based Aegis missile defense system for homeland defense. In 2020, the Department of Defense conducted a test of an Aegis SM-3 Block IIA interceptor against an ICBM-class target.\nThe 2022 Missile Defense Review restated the traditional U.S. policy that Ground Mid-Course Defense (GMD) is \u201cneither intended nor capable of defeating the missile capabilities of Russia and China\u201d. The review also reaffirmed \u201cthe interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive systems\u201d. It also emphasized, for the first time, the lower-tier threat posed by unmanned aircraft systems.\nElements of the Current U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System\nThe U.S. missile defense system has three critical physical components: 1) sensors/radars, 2) interceptors, and 3) command and control infrastructure. This factsheet primarily discusses interceptors and radars. For ballistic missile and missile defense basics and the historical background of missile defense programs, please visit \u201cMissiles and Missile Defense Systems at a Glance.\u201d\nGROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE\nProgram & Key Elements\nKey element: Ground-based missile interceptor (GBI) consisting of a multistage booster and an exoatmospheric kill vehicle (EKV).\nThe EKV separates from the booster in space and seeks out its target through radar updates and use of its onboard visual and infrared sensors.\nThe EKV destroys its target by colliding with it. This process is referred to as \"hit-to-kill\" or \"kinetic kill.\"\nDesigned to Counter\nGoal: Intercept strategic ballistic missile warheads in midcourse-stage.\nStatus\nInitially fielded in 2004.\nAs of fiscal year 2024, the total cost of the GMD system is estimated to be over $63 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office and budget documents.\nThe system has had 12 successful intercepts in 21 tests.\nThe first test of the GMD system against an ICBM-class target with simple countermeasures took place on May 30, 2017, and was deemed successful.\nThe first test which involved firing two interceptors against one ICBM target occurred in March 2019 and was deemed successful. In a real-world scenario, multiple interceptors would be fired at an incoming missile.\nCapability / Schedule\nThe Pentagon deploys 44 ground-based interceptors (GBIs)\u201340 at Fort Greely, Alaska, and four at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. As of 2020, 20 of the 44 interceptors are armed with the Capability Enhancement (CE) I kill vehicle, 16 with the CE-II kill vehicle, and eight with the CE-II Block 1 kill vehicle. The CE-II and CE-II Block 1 interceptors are paired with an upgraded booster.\nIn December 2024, Congress mandated that the Department of Defense construct a third ground-based mid-course defense site on the east coast of the United States by 2031.\nAs of 2023, the MDA is performing a service life extension program that includes upgrading the boosters of 11 of the 20 CE-I interceptors.\nIn 2017, the Trump administration announced a plan to deploy twenty more GBIs to be installed in a fourth missile field at Ft. Greely, Alaska. These interceptors were to be armed with a new Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), but development for the RKV was terminated in 2019 after encountering design problems.\nThe Biden administration plans to meet this commitment by fielding 20 of the in-development Next-Generation Interceptors alongside the older GBIs, emplacing the first beginning in 2028. Unlike the RKV program, the Next-Generation Interceptor program will also involve development of a new booster.\nFormer MDA Director Adm. James Syring told a Senate panel in 2013 that the MDA tests the GMD system \u201cin a controlled, scripted environment based on the amount of time and money each one of these tests costs,\u201d implying limits to the realism of the tests.\nFollowing the May 30, 2017, test, the Pentagon's testing office updated its assessment, which had described the GMD system as having only a \u201climited capability\u201d to defend the U.S. homeland from a small number of simple long-range missiles launched from North Korea or Iran. In a June 6, 2017, memo, the office said that the system has \u201cdemonstrated capability\u201d to defend against a small number of long-range missiles threats that employ \u201csimple countermeasures.\u201d However, researchers with the Union of Concerned Scientists noted in a 2017 report that the only test of the GMD system against an ICBM-class target was \u201csimplified in important ways that enhanced the test\u2019s chance of success instead of challenging the system to work in a realistic way.\u201d\nAEGIS BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE (BMD)\nProgram & Key Elements\nKey elements include: the RIM-161 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), RIM-174 Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), and the Aegis combat system.\nThe SM-3 is a hit-to-kill midcourse missile comprised of a three-stage booster with a kill vehicle. There are three variations of the SM-3 missile in use: Block IA, Block IB, and Block IIA.\nThe SM-6 is a hit-to-kill terminal-phase missile based on the SM-3 that is capable of targeting aircraft, ballistic, and cruise missiles.\nAs the Navy\u2019s component of the missile defense system, the Aegis system is central to the defense footprint in Asia and the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense in Europe. Aegis is a sea-based system, with missile launchers and radars mounted on cruisers and destroyers but is adaptable to land systems as well.\nDesigned to Counter\nGeared toward defending against short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their midcourse phase with an emphasis on the ascent stage.\nStatus\nIn 2005, the role of Aegis missile defense evolved from that of a forward sensor to include engagement capability.\nAs of August 2024, the SM-3 has a flight test record of 40 intercepts in 50 attempts, not including two tests in which the target missile failed to launch.\nThe SM-6 has a flight test record of 8 intercepts in 10 attempts.\nJapan\u2019s eight KONGO Class Destroyers have been upgraded with Aegis capabilities. Japan and the United States are co-developing the SM-3 block IIA jointly developed the SM-3 block IIA guided missiles between 2006-2017.\nCapability / Schedule\nUnder the fiscal 2025 budget submission, by the end of the fiscal year, there are scheduled to be 56 Aegis BMD ships. That number will grow to 69 by the end of fiscal year 2030.\nAegis systems are also deployed on land and known as Aegis Ashore. There are two Aegis Ashore sites in Europe. Romania, since 2016, has hosted land-based SM-3 Block IB interceptors, and Poland, since July 2024, has hosted SM-3 IIAs interceptors. An Aegis Ashore system is also located in Guam.\nThe first intercept test of the new SM-3 IIA interceptor occurred in February 2017 and was successful. However, the second and third intercept tests of the missile in June 2017 and January 2018 failed to destroy their targets. There were two more tests before the end of 2018 on Oct. 26 and Dec. 11, both successful, with the December test particularly notable for being the first successful intercept of an IRBM target and using the ability to \u201cengage on remote\u201d using a forward-based sensor.\nIn November 2020, an SM-3 Block IIA interceptor was successfully flight tested against an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\nIn April 2024, an SM-3 missile interceptor was used for the first time in combat. SM-3s intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles heading toward Israel in a round of reprisals following an attack on an Iranian consulate.\nTERMINAL HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE (THAAD)\nProgram & Key Elements\nKey elements include: 1) an interceptor missile comprising a single rocket booster with a separating kill-vehicle, 2) an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar unit to identify and discriminate between incoming missiles, and 3) an infrared seeker to home in on its target.\nThe THAAD kill vehicle relies on hit-to-kill kinetic interception.\nTHAAD batteries have four components: launcher, interceptors, radar, and fire control. Each battery can carry 48-72 interceptors (there are eight interceptors per launcher and typically each battery is believed to contain six to nine launch vehicles).\nTHAAD missiles are fired from a truck-mounted launcher.\nDesigned to Counter\nTHAAD\u2019s mission is to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles at the end of their midcourse stage and in the terminal stage.\nIntercepts could take place inside or outside the atmosphere.\nStatus\nAs of 2023, THAAD has succeeded in completing 16 interceptions in 20 tests since 2006. Four other THAAD tests, as of 2023, have been classed as \u201cno-tests.\u201d (Note: A \u201cno-test\u201d occurs when the target malfunctions after launch, so the interceptor is not launched.)\nThe Pentagon\u2019s independent testing office says the THAAD testing program still must \u201caddress more complex engagement conditions and realistic raid scenarios.\u201d\nOn July 11, 2017, MDA executed a successful intercept test of the THAAD system against an air-launched intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) target. The test was the first against an IRBM-class target.\nCapability / Schedule\nAs of July 2024, the U.S. Army operates seven THAAD batteries, each with its own AN/TPY-2 radar. Two are deployed in the Asia-Pacific: one in Guam, and one in South Korea.\nProduction of the first THAAD interceptors began in March 2011. The Army received its 800th operational interceptor in December 2023.\nTHAAD launchers are also capable of launching PAC-3 MSE interceptors originally designed for the Patriot system.\nThe United States and South Korea decided in July 2016 to deploy a THAAD battery in South Korea to counter North Korean threats despite strong objections from China. The battery began operating in April 2017.\nA THAAD battery was deployed to Guam in 2013 to counter potential North Korea IRBM threats to the island and U.S. military assets there. The first test of the THAAD system against an IRBM target occurred in July 2017.\nOther nations that procured THAAD or intend to do so include the UAE, which has two fully operational batteries, and Saudi Arabia, which has concluded a deal for the purchase of seven THAAD batteries and equipment.\nPATRIOT ADVANCED CAPABILITY-3 (PAC-3)\nProgram & Key Elements\nConsists of a one-piece, hit-to-kill missile interceptor fired from a mobile launching station, which carries 16 PAC-3 missiles.\nThe missile is guided by an independent radar that sends its tracking data to the missile through a mobile engagement control station.\nA blast fragmentation warhead kills the target.\nDesigned to Counter\nPAC-3 is designed to defend against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal stage at lower altitudes than the THAAD system.\nStatus\nPAC-3s destroyed two Iraqi short-range ballistic missiles during the 2003 conflict and shot down a U.S. fighter jet. Earlier Patriot models also deployed to the region shot down nine Iraqi missiles and a British combat aircraft.\nPAC-3s have been extensively used during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Patriot missiles have intercepted several types of targets, including fighter jets, short-range missiles, and the Russian Kinzhal hypersonic missile.\nCapability / Schedule\nThe PAC-3 is operated by a number of countries other than the United States, including NATO allies and Japan, South Korea, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan, and Bahrain.\nThe following is an overview of early-warning and missile-tracking systems intended to complement the missile defense interceptors listed above.\nSPACE-BASED INFRARED SYSTEM-HIGH (SBIRS-HIGH)\nProgram Elements\nKey Elements: 1) geosynchronous (GEO) satellites orbiting the earth; 2) sensors on host satellites in highly elliptical earth orbit (HEO).\nKey Function\nPrimary objective is to provide early warning of theater and strategic missile launches.\nProvides data for technical intelligence and battle space awareness.\nStatus/Cost\nCurrently there are four SBIRS sensors mounted on host satellites in highly elliptical orbit (HEO-1, HEO-2, HEO-3, and HEO-4), although HEO-1 and HEO-2 are in \u201cstorage/residual operational mode.\u201d\nThere are six SBIRS satellites in geosynchronous orbit. GEO-1 was launched in May 2011, GEO-2 in March 2013, GEO-3 in January 2017, and GEO-4 in January 2018, GEO-5 in May 2021, GEO-6 in August 2022. GEO-5 and GEO-6 are replacements for GEO-1 and GEO-2, but the latter two remain in orbit.\nThe SBIRS program originally called for two additional sensors, GEO-7 and GEO-8, but these were scrapped in favor of pursuing an entirely new SBIRS follow-on program.\nThe GAO concluded that the program had cost $20.3 billion by 2020\u2014four times greater than an initial estimate of $5.6 billion in 1996. Since 2020, procurement costs have added another $490 million to the now-concluded program.\nA successor program, Next Generation - Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR), is being developed to replace SBIRS. It is expected to include only four satellites\u2014two in geosynchronous orbit, and two in highly elliptical earth orbit\u2014and be prepared for its first launch in 2026.\nSPACE-BASED MISSILE-TRACKING PROGRAMS\nProgram Elements\nTwo Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) missile-tracking satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO) were launched in 2009 and retired in 2022.\nThree new programs are in development or deployment: 1) The Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) program, which launched two satellites into LEO in February 2024. 2) The Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) program, a multi-function military support constellation that will be composed of hundreds of smaller satellites with wide field-of-view missile tracking capabilities. 3) The Resilient Missile Warning Missile Tracking - Medium Earth Orbit program, which is intended to \u201cbolster\u201d SBIRS and Next-Gen OPIR in a constellation of dozens of satellites, although only the first twelve are currently in development as of early 2025.\nKey Function\nOriginal mission of STSS satellites was to provide missile tracking data to enable interception of all classes of ballistic missiles.\nThe program later focused on supporting Missile Defense Agency (MDA) research into future space-based tracking capabilities, such as HBTSS.\nStatus/Cost\nThe two STSS satellites launched in 2009 were originally to be the first in a 24-satellite LEO constellation under a Clinton-era plan.\nThe program was originally known as SBIRS-Low but was renamed STSS when transferred to the MDA in 2001.\nIn March 2022, MDA deorbited the two STSS satellites.\nA successor program, the Precision Tracking Space System, was abandoned in 2013.\nIn 2018, the HBTSS research and development program was launched to develop fire-control-quality missile tracking data for interceptors. As the name indicates, the program is equally focused on hypersonic and ballistic missiles.\nAccording to the fiscal year 2025 budget request, the HBTSS prototyping program has cost $724 million so far, and is likely to cost another $155 million over the next three years\nThe PWSA program envisions a constellation of hundreds of tracking and information transport satellites that will support multiple military functions under the Department of Defense\u2019s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) program.\nThe PWSA program launched 27 \u201cTranche 0\u201d developmental satellites by early 2024, including a mix of missile tracking and information transport satellites.\nThe Space Development Agency intended to begin launching a second group of satellites, Tranche 1, into LEO in late 2024, but has missed that target. Tranche 1 will consist of 126 information transport satellites, 28 missile-warning and missile-tracking satellites, and 4 demonstration infrared sensor satellites for missile-defense support.\nThe missile warning and tracking layer of PWSA has cost $4 billion through the fiscal 2025 budget and will likely cost $9.3 billion over the next four years. Additional sensing capabilities in the PWSA constellation have cost $294 million so far and $70 million more over the next four years.\nTwo more tranches of PWSA satellites are planned.\nThe Resilient Missile Warning Missile Tracking - Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) program is hoping to begin launching its first group of satellites, labeled \u201cEpoch 1,\u201d in late 2026.\nThrough the fiscal 2025 budget, the MEO program has cost $1.94 billion. It is projected to cost an additional $5.1 billion over the four years\nThe space-based sensors are supported by land- and sea-based radars.\nFollowing hardware and software updates as part of the Upgraded Early Warning Radars program, the two Cold War-era Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) and three PAVE Phased Array Warning System (PAVE PAWS) land-based radar sites perform the traditional missile detection and warning missions, and also assist in missile tracking. The two BMEWS sites are at Fylingdales, United Kingdom, and Pituffik (formerly Thule), Greenland, while the PAVE PAWS sites are at Beale, California, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Clear, Alaska.\nA new key radar for ICBM defense is the Long-Range Discriminating Radar (LRDR) based at Clear, Alaska, alongside the older PAVE PAWS radar. It is designed to \u201cdistinguish between enemy ICBMs and decoys\u201d and is expected to be fully operational by 2025.\nThe westward-facing COBRA Dane radar on Shemya Island, in the Aleutian archipelago, was also upgraded in February 2010, and is expected to be in use until 2030.\nA single mobile sea-based X-band radar, built on a converted oil-rig, also provides mid-course acquisition, tracking, discrimination, and hit-assessment capabilities."
