  "description": "Our picks for the best free movies to stream this weekend include a humorous football tale and a comedy based on an MTV show.",
  "content": "The summer season is over, and Hollywood moves to its fall slate. The first Friday of September will be terrifying as The Conjuring: Last Rites opens nationwide. Like all Conjuring movies, expect Last Rites to be extremely profitable.\n\nAfter getting out to the theater, save some money and watch free movies on FAST services, like Tubi and Pluto TV. Our picks this weekend include an MTV comedy, an Adam Sandler football pic, and a coming-of-age tale.\n\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best free movies, and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe Jackass guys deserve medals of honor. It\u2019s beyond me why some of these guys still put their bodies through the wringer. Johnny Knoxville and Co. will literally hurt themselves for entertainment, and for that, we thank you.\n\nJackass: The Movie is essentially a longer version of an episode of the TV show with a bigger budget. From Knoxville getting destroyed by Butterbean to Chris Pontius dancing in the street as the Party Boy, Jackass: The Movie will leave you in tears from laughter. You also might cry from agony after Steve-O snorts wasabi.\n\nIt\u2019s officially football season. Before your favorite NFL team takes the field, revisit the fictional matchup between the convicts and the guards in The Longest Yard remake. Adam Sandler stars as Paul Crewe, a disgraced former quarterback forced to serve a three-year prison sentence.\n\nWith a former pro at his prison, Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) forces Crewe to captain a football team of cons to get slaughtered in a game against his prison guards. Much to his surprise, Crewe forms a competent team, but he soon learns the warden won\u2019t let him win. The Longest Yard is an ideal Sandler movie packed with memorable one-liners and absurd humor.\n\nAs if! Fast Times director Amy Heckerling transforms Jane Austen\u2019s Emma into a delightful teen comedy with Clueless, which recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. Rich girl Cher (Alicia Silverstone) can get anything she wants except a good grade from Mr. Hall (Wallace Shawn).\n\nAs a matchmaker, Cher sets Mr. Hall up with Miss Geist (Twink Caplan) to lighten his mood. Cher moves on to makeovers next and takes the clumsy Tai (Brittany Murphy) under her wing. Smart and witty, Clueless captures high school stereotypes while also crafting a genuinely thoughtful story.",

The road warrior cuts a deal with Furiosa and agrees to help the women escape to freedom.

Joe hires four grandmothers (Lorraine Bracco, Talia Shire, Brenda Vaccaro, and Susan Sarandon), or \u201cNonnas,\u201d to cook his mother\u2019s recipes. It\u2019s a huge gamble, but Joe believes that once customers experience his place, it will bring them back to their childhood."

He is best known as a co-creator and star of the MTV reality stunt show Jackass (2000\u20132001) and its subsequent movies.\nFollowing the conclusion of Jackass, Knoxville and his co-stars returned for the first installment in the Jackass film series, with a second and third installment released in 2006 and 2010. Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa (2013), the first film in the series to feature a storyline, saw him star as his Jackass character Irving Zisman. The fourth installment, Jackass Forever, was released in 2022.\nKnoxville has had acting roles in films Men in Black II (2002), A Dirty Shame and Walking Tall (both 2004), The Dukes of Hazzard, The Ringer, and a cameo role as a sleazy corporate president of a skateboard company in Lords of Dogtown (all 2005), The Last Stand (2013), Skiptrace (2016), and the television series Reboot (2022). He also voiced Leonardo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014).\nEarly life\n[edit]Knoxville was born Philip John Clapp in Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 11, 1971,[2][3] the son of Sunday school teacher Lemoyne (n\u00e9e Houck; 1938\u20132017) and car and tire salesman Philip Clapp (1935\u20132018).[4][5][6] He has two older sisters.[7] His cousin, singer-songwriter Roger Alan Wade, gave him a copy of Jack Kerouac's book On the Road. He credits this with sparking his interest in acting.[8][9]\nKnoxville attended South-Young High School (now South-Doyle High School) in Knoxville, where he played on the baseball team and was named All-Knoxville Interscholastic League Honorable Mention. He also played in the Knoxville Area All Star game as a pitcher.[10][11] After graduating in 1989, he moved to California to become an actor. He began appearing in commercials and as an extra,[12] including a job as Keanu Reeves' stand-in on the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola film Bram Stoker's Dracula.[13] When the breakthrough role he sought eluded him, he decided to create his own opportunities by writing and pitching article ideas to various magazines. An idea to test self-defense equipment on himself captured the interest of Jeff Tremaine's skateboarding magazine Big Brother, and the stunts were filmed and included in Big Brother's \"Number Two\" video.\nCareer\n[edit]Jackass\n[edit]Knoxville is responsible for many of the ideas in Jackass, and is often seen as the de facto leader of the crew.[14] The show is directed by Jeff Tremaine, who produced a pilot that used footage from Big Brother and Bam Margera's CKY videos.\nWith help from Tremaine's friend, film director Spike Jonze, they pitched a series to various networks. A deal was made with MTV and Jackass was born.[15] He starred in Jackass: The Movie, Jackass Number Two, Jackass 2.5, Jackass 3D (which marked the 10th anniversary of the franchise), Jackass 3.5, Jackass Forever, and Jackass 4.5.\nKnoxville also participated in the Gumball 3000 for Jackass along with co-stars Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Jackass director Jeff Tremaine, and cinematographer Dimitry Elyashkevich. Prior to Jackass premiering on MTV, Knoxville and company turned down an offer to perform their stunts for Saturday Night Live on a weekly basis,[16] though Knoxville later hosted a 2005 episode of the show.\nActing\n[edit]Knoxville's original leading role debut was set to be a holiday comedy released in late 2001 named The Tree but the project never came to fruition.[17] Knoxville has been in several feature films, such as The Dukes of Hazzard (2005) and playing a two-headed alien in Men in Black II (2002). Knoxville also worked with John Waters in A Dirty Shame (2004), and appeared as a supporting character to The Rock in Walking Tall that same year.\nHe starred in Katrina Holden Bronson's Daltry Calhoun in 2005, and in The Ringer as an office worker who pretends to be disabled and joins the Special Olympics to pay for surgery for his office's janitor. He starred in the movie Lords of Dogtown as Topper Burks, made a minor appearance in the 2000 movie Coyote Ugly, and was featured as a guest voice on two episodes of King of the Hill.\nKnoxville appeared in the John Madden-directed adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel, Killshot, however, his character was subsequently removed from the final cut of the film. He guest-starred in a season 3 episode \"Prank Wars\" on Viva La Bam, in which he and Ryan Dunn trashed Bam Margera's Hummer and performed other pranks. He voiced himself in an episode of Family Guy. He co-produced The Dudesons in America and the now-canceled Nitro Circus on MTV.\nIn 2010, Knoxville hosted a three-part online video for Palladium Boots titled Detroit Lives. The videos focus on the resurgence of creativity in Detroit. Knoxville guest-starred as the voice of Johnny Krill, an extreme sports enthusiast, in \"Extreme Spots\", a 2012 episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. Knoxville voiced Leonardo in the 2014 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles[18] but did not appear in the sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.[19]\nProduction credits\n[edit]Knoxville has a production company called Dickhouse Productions, which he owns and operates with Jeff Tremaine and Spike Jonze of the Jackass franchise.[20] Dickhouse's projects include The Birth of Big Air (2010), a documentary about Mat Hoffman that was part of ESPN's 30 for 30 series, and The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia (2010), both of which have been picked up by Tribeca Films.[21]\nIn May 2014, Knoxville (along with Jackass Executive Producer/H.M.F.I.C. Derek Freda) formally announced the formation of a new production company called 'Hello Junior', which will continue Knoxville's now-longstanding relationship with Paramount Pictures, who have signed an exclusive two-year first-look deal with Knoxville and 'Hello Junior' in the wake of the massive success of Bad Grandpa in late 2013. Knoxville was quoted as saying, \"I am over the damn moon about continuing an amazing partnership with Paramount Pictures. I have many more films to make and bones to break. I am glad I will be doing it for Paramount.\"[22]\nProfessional wrestling\n[edit]Knoxville, as with the Jackass crew, has been involved with the professional wrestling promotion WWE. On the October 13, 2008, episode of Raw, Knoxville made his WWE television debut feuding with The Great Khali.[23] Knoxville later appeared as the guest star on the October 4, 2010, episode of Raw in Wichita, Kansas.[24]\nOn January 1, 2022, at WWE's Day 1 pay-per-view, Knoxville announced he would be at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view as a participant in the event's signature namesake match.[25] His entry was confirmed on the January 7 episode of SmackDown while simultaneously starting a feud with Sami Zayn. He entered the Royal Rumble at number 9 and was eliminated by Zayn.[26] Knoxville then returned on the February 25 episode of SmackDown and challenged Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship that the latter won the week prior, but Knoxville got rejected and was attacked by Zayn. The following week, Knoxville distracted Zayn during his match with Ricochet, allowing the latter to win the championship from him. Later that same night, Zayn challenged Knoxville to a match at WrestleMania 38 to which Knoxville accepted, and the match was stipulated as an Anything Goes match, wherein on Night 2 of that event, he won the match against Zayn with the help of Jackass members Chris Pontius, Wee Man, director Jeff Tremaine, and new members Jasper Dolphin and his father Compston \"Dark Shark\" Wilson.[27]\nPodcast\n[edit]Knoxville stepped into the world of podcasting in April of 2024 with his show \"Pretty Sure I Can Fly with Johnny Knoxville & Elna Baker\".[28]\nPersonal life\n[edit]Knoxville married Melanie Lynn Cates on May 15, 1995. Their daughter was born on January 4, 1996.[29] She can be heard in the credits for Jackass Number Two, is seen in \"The Making of Jackass Two\" on the special features on the DVD, and was seen punching Tremaine with a boxing glove in the credits of Jackass 3D. After 11 years of marriage, Knoxville and Cates separated in July 2006. Knoxville filed for divorce on July 3, 2007.[29] The marriage legally ended in March 2008,[30] with final divorce arrangements settled in July 2009.[31]\nOn February 4, 2009, Knoxville explained on The Howard Stern Show that he tore his urethra during a stunt for Jackass Presents: Mat Hoffman's Tribute to Evel Knievel, describing how he had to flush it twice daily.[32] He said this was done by \"sticking a tube into [his] penis all the way up to [his] bladder\", a practice known as urinary catheterization. He said the process prevented scar tissue from forming[33] and that he performed the procedure \"twice a day for three and a half years\" after the injury.[34]\nIn December 2009, Knoxville's girlfriend Naomi Nelson gave birth to their son.[35] Knoxville and Nelson married on September 24, 2010.[36] Nelson gave birth to their second child together, a daughter, in October 2011.[37] On June 17, 2022, it was reported that Knoxville had filed for divorce.[38]\nWhile filming the prank show The Prank Panel in December 2022, Knoxville was sued by handyman Khalil Khan, who alleged that he was subjected to a \"terrifying ordeal\" after signing up for a job on TaskRabbit.[39][40] He was sued again in May 2024 for allegedly tazing a segment producer during the filming of The Prank Panel.[41]\nFilmography\n[edit]Feature films\n[edit]| Year | Title | Role | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1995 | Desert Blues | Bob | |\n| 1998 | Number Two: Big Brother | Himself (uncredited) | Direct-to-video |\n| 1999 | boob | Himself | Direct-to-video |\n| 2000 | Coyote Ugly | College Guy | |\n| 2001 | Crap: Big Brother | Himself (uncredited) | Direct-to-video |\n| Don't Try This at Home: The Steve-O Video | Himself | Guest appearances Direct-to-video | |\n| CKY3 | Himself | Guest appearances Direct-to-video | |\n| 2002 | Life Without Dick | Dick Rasmusson | |\n| Big Trouble | Eddie Leadbetter | ||\n| Deuces Wild | Vinnie 'Fish' | ||\n| Men in Black II | Scrad / Charlie | ||\n| Jackass: The Movie | Himself / Irving Zisman | Writer and producer | |\n| CKY4: The Latest & Greatest | Himself | Guest appearances Direct-to-video | |\n| 2003 | Grand Theft Parsons | Phil Kaufman | |\n| 2004 | Walking Tall | Deputy Ray Templeton | |\n| A Dirty Shame | Ray 'Ray-Ray' Perkins | ||\n| Steve-O: The Early Years | Himself | Guest appearances Direct-to-video | |\n| 2005 | Lords of Dogtown | Topper Burks | |\n| The Dukes of Hazzard | Luke Duke | ||\n| Daltry Calhoun | Daltry Calhoun | ||\n| The Ringer | Steve Barker / Jeffie | ||\n| 2006 | Ultimate Predator | Himself | Direct-to-video Guest appearances |\n| Jackass Number Two | Himself / Irving Zisman | Writer and producer | |\n| 2007 | Jackass 2.5 | ||\n| The Man Who Souled the World | Himself | Documentary | |\n| 2008 | Killshot | Ferris Britton | Scenes deleted |\n| Jackass Presents: Mat Hoffman's Tribute to Evel Knievel | Himself | Direct-to-video Executive producer | |\n| 2009 | Jackass: The Lost Tapes | Direct-to-video | |\n| 2010 | Father of Invention | Troy Coangelo | |\n| Jackass 3D | Himself / Irving Zisman | Writer and producer | |\n| 2011 | Jackass 3.5 | ||\n| 2012 | Nitro Circus: The Movie | Himself | Guest appearances |\n| Nature Calls | Kirk | ||\n| Fun Size | J\u00f6rgen | Uncredited | |\n| 2013 | The Last Stand | Lewis Dinkum | |\n| Movie 43 | Pete | ||\n| Small Apartments | Tommy Balls | ||\n| Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa | Irving Zisman | Writer and producer | |\n| 2014 | Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa .5 | Himself / Irving Zisman | |\n| Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles | Leonardo | Voice | |\n| 2015 | Being Evel | Himself | Producer Documentary |\n| 2016 | Elvis & Nixon | Sonny West | |\n| Skiptrace | Connor Watts | ||\n| 2017 | Dumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine | Himself | Documentary |\n| 2018 | Half Magic | Father Gary | |\n| Weightless | Ed | ||\n| Action Point | Deshawn Crious 'D.C.'

      "text": "The word \u201cfree\u201d can be a beautiful thing, as long as you know what strings come attached. In the case of movies, free means that you have to sit through some advertisements to watch it, which definitely isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, especially if you like taking bathroom breaks.\nAnd, as it turns out, there are plenty of great movies available on free streaming services. We\u2019ve pulled together 10 of the very best movies you can stream now, all of which are available for the low cost of nothing. Check them out below.\nTotal Recall (1990)\nFew directors have been on quite the hot streak that Paul Verhoven was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Total Recall is one of the best movies in that run. The film tells the story of a construction worker living in the future who dreams of traveling to Mars.\nWhen he visits a new company that can implant false memories, he realizes that his entire life has been a lie and that he\u2019s really a secret agent with a price on his head. Total Recall is an expansive sci-fi movie, especially for its era, and it\u2019s also one where the plot confuses you in ways that will leave your head spinning.\nYou can watch Total Recall on Pluto TV.\nFargo (1996)\nThe Coen brothers are among the great directors in the history of movies, and Fargo might be their most definitive work. The film tells the story of a kidnapping gone wrong and the trail of death that comes in its wake.\nAnchored by a brilliant central performance from Frances McDormand, Fargo is funny, dark, and ultimately focused on the darkness at the heart of people\u2019s hearts. Few movies feel more complete and note-perfect than this one, and even fewer will leave you eager to start the whole experience over from the beginning.\nYou can watch Fargo on Tubi.\n12 Angry Men (1957)\nAlthough it could be accused of feeling stagey, 12 Angry Men has instead become one of the most important movies ever made, even though it\u2019s set almost entirely in a single room. The film tells the story of 12 jurors debating the merits of a specific case as they are all slowly swayed to the side of the lone dissenter.\nBuried in the story\u2019s script are questions of prejudice and misunderstanding that are far deeper than the intricacies of the case at hand. These details have helped the story endure through all these years.\nYou can watch 12 Angry Men on Tubi.\nSpotlight (2015)\nThere are plenty of great newspaper procedurals out there, but Spotlight is one of the very best. The film tells the story of the reporters who investigated reports that the Catholic Church had covered up systemic abuse of young parishioners.\nBecause it\u2019s grounded in reporters at a single paper, Spotlight manages to take a pretty grounded look at a remarkably devastating story and reminds us what value good journalism has in a world that seems to devalue it more and more every day.\nYou can watch Spotlight on Tubi.\nLake Mungo (2008)\nA pseudo-documentary horror film that is every bit as terrifying as it gets credit for being, Lake Mungo tells the story of the drowning death of a teen girl and what her family learns about her double life in the aftermath of her death.\nThe twists and turns of this movie will leave you genuinely disturbed, as the family discovers more about a daughter they thought they knew, and we learn more about what\u2019s real in this supposed haunting and what isn\u2019t. Lake Mungo isn\u2019t an actual documentary, but it will leave you spooked by the end anyway.\nYou can watch Lake Mungo on Tubi.\n28 Days Later (2002)\nDanny Boyle\u2019s foundational horror classic, 28 Days Later is set 28 days after the rage virus has descended upon much of the United Kingdom. The film follows one man who wakes from a coma to discover a totally changed world and has to fight for survival.\nAlthough the film is essentially told in interconnected vignettes, Boyle\u2019s bracing digital cinematography and Cillian Murphy\u2019s central performance make it a film that is hard to forget. There are plenty of zombie movies, but none of them were quite as earth-shattering as this one.\nYou can watch 28 Days Later on Pluto TV.\nPan\u2019s Labyrinth (2006)\nStill the best movie that Guillermo Del Toro has ever made, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth is both a historical drama and an epic fantasy. The film follows a young girl living in Spain in the 1940s who becomes the stepdaughter to a sadistic general. As she witnesses his various atrocities, she becomes more and more drawn into the world of Pan\u2019s Labyrinth.\nFeaturing some brilliant production and creature design, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth takes serious, adult ideas and filters them through the mind of a child. In that way, it\u2019s both a fairy tale and something far more grounded, and thereby the fullest realization of Del Toro\u2019s vision.\nYou can watch Pan\u2019s Labyrinth on Tubi.\nGladiator (2000)\nHollywood used to make its bread and butter on sword and sandal epics, and Gladiator is a throwback to that era. The film tells the story of a Roman general who is betrayed by the new emperor in a power grab and eventually becomes a celebrity in the gladiatorial arena to get his revenge.\nAnchored by some of the best work of Russell Crowe\u2019s career, Gladiator is a thrilling, broad-scale blockbuster. It\u2019s not a perfect script, but Ridley Scott\u2019s remarkable ability to bring every element of ancient Rome to life more than makes up for any cliches scattered throughout the film.\nYou can watch Gladiator on Pluto TV.\nNo Country for Old Men (2007)\n2007 was a great movie year, and in a crowded field, No Country for Old Men rose to the top. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen and adapted from a Cormac McCarthy story of the same name, the film follows a hunter who stumbles upon a bag of money and finds himself chased by a sociopathic assassin and the police.\nAlthough the movie has many of the beats of a conventional thriller, Javier Bardem\u2019s incredible supporting turn, coupled with the Coens\u2019 meditations on the elemental nature of good and evil, make No Country for Old Men riveting from start to finish.\nYou can watch No Country for Old Men on Pluto TV.\nGoodfellas (1990)\nOne of the great gangster movies ever made, Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill, a real gangster who was part of the New York City mafia in the 1960s and \u201970s. Often lauded as a masterpiece, Goodfellas depicts the highs of a gangster and the unpredictable violence and death that always permeated it.\nAlthough Goodfellas can be a riotously good time, director Martin Scorsese is always careful to reveal the rotten core at the heart of it all. These are men who cheat, lie, and abuse their way through life, hoping that they\u2019ll never have to be like the regular people they so evidently despise.\nYou can watch Goodfellas on Tubi."

      "text": "Nearly twenty years after the original Jackass series was cancelled by MTV, a revival show may be on the horizon. Via The Hollywood Reporter, Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish revealed the news during an earnings call earlier today. He also mentioned that the show\u2019s original creators are involved with the revival.\n\u201cBased off the success of Jackass Forever, we\u2019re working with the creators to continue the partnership with a new series, bringing even more ridiculous antics straight to Paramount+,\u201d said Bakish.\nJeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze, and Johnny Knoxville created Jackass as a reality show for MTV in 2000. Knoxville also starred in the series alongside Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Dave England, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Jason \u201cWee Man\u201d Acu\u00f1a, Ehren McGhehey, and Preston Lacy as they performed ill-advised stunts and pranks on each other.\nFollowing the show\u2019s cancellation in 2002, Knoxville and his cast reunited for Jackass: The Movie in 2002. While that was intended to be the franchise\u2019s swan song, its box office success led to theatrical sequels in 2006 and 2010. There were also two direct-to-video Jackass spinoffs that don\u2019t count toward the main series.\nKnoxville, Steve-O, Pontius, England, Wee Man, Ehren, and Lacy reunited for Jackass Forever, which earned $80 million at the box office earlier this year. They were joined by a new generation of \u201cJackasses,\u201d including Jasper Dolphin, Rachel Wolfson, Sean \u201cPoopies\u201d McInerney, Zach Holmes, and Eric Manaka.\nNotably absent from the lineup was Margera, who sued his former collaborators Tremaine, Knoxville, and Jonze, as well as MTV and Paramount over his dismissal from Jackass Forever. The lawsuit was settled last month. However, it remains to be seen if Margera will be invited to participate in any future Jackass projects."

      "text": "The latest Stephen King adaptation is now on Hulu. Based on King\u2019s short story from the \u201980s, The Monkey wowed audiences with its diabolical humor and insane kills. Now on streaming, the horror film should find a new audience.\nStaying in the horror realm, Ready or Not was a fantastic surprise in 2019. The thriller did so well that a sequel is on the way next year. Elsewhere, 10 Things I Hate About You is always a solid streaming selection.\nKeep reading for the rest of the best movies on Hulu.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\n10 Things I Hate About You (1999)\nThe movie that turned the late Heath Ledger into a heartthrob (and rightfully so) was 10 Things I Hate About You. In this modern adaptation of a Shakespeare comedy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Cameron, a new student who wants to date the popular Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik).\nIn Bianca\u2019s house, there is one rule: she can\u2019t date until her antisocial sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does. Enter Patrick Verona (Ledger), the handsome bad boy recruited by Cameron to woo Kat. Patrick is used to getting what he wants, but winning over Kat will be his hardest challenge yet.\nThe Monkey (2025)\nDeath comes in the form of a sadistic toy in Osgood Perkins\u2019 The Monkey. Growing up, twins Hal and Bill Shelburn (Christian Convery) discover that a toy monkey causes the most violent and horrific deaths. The boys throw the monkey away, hoping to never see it again.\n25 years later, the monkey reappears and wreaks havoc. Hal and Bill (Theo James) reunite to save their loved ones by destroying this evil monkey. Unfortunately, some people will have to die along the way.\nReady or Not (2019)\nA children\u2019s game turns deadly at a family event in Ready or Not. Grace (Samara Weaving) hits the jackpot by marrying Alex (Mark O\u2019Brien) and joining his wealthy family. On her wedding night, Grace is forced to play a game of hide-and-seek with her new family.\nThinking nothing of it, Grace playfully abides by the rules and hides. She soon finds out that Alex\u2019s family must kill her before dawn, or they die instead. To last until dawn, this bride must fight back and outlast her in-laws by any means necessary.\nThe Amateur (2025)\nRami Malek is a CIA analyst out for revenge in The Amateur. Charlie Heller (Malek) is a cryptographer who prefers to work behind a desk. Charlie\u2019s world comes crashing down after his wife (Rachel Brosnahan) is killed in a terrorist attack. Conducting his own investigation, Charlie identifies the four suspects who played a part in his wife\u2019s death. When Charlie brings this information to his superiors, they refuse to take action.\nMotivated by revenge, the introverted Charlie heads into the field and hunts down his wife\u2019s killers. The CIA eventually realizes that it made a mistake to underestimate Charlie, who becomes a ruthless vigilante that the agency cannot control.\nSunshine (2007)\nBefore directing the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle helmed the vastly underrated sci-fi thriller, Sunshine. In the future, Earth begins freezing due to the Sun\u2019s deterioration. The human race will cease to exist if the Sun dies. Eight astronauts \u2014 including Robert Capa (Cillian Murphy), James Mace (Chris Evans), and Cassie (Rose Byrne) \u2014 aboard the Icarus II are tasked with detonating a stellar bomb inside the Sun in hopes of reigniting it.\nLike all explorations to outer space, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Each problem results in another tragedy. These astronauts thought they could make it home. As they approach the Sun, they quickly realize that completing the mission is all that matters.\n(500) Days of Summer (2009)\nExplore the highs and lows of a relationship in (500) Days of Summer.

      "text": "What would Hollywood be without Adam Sandler? It would be a lot less fun, that\u2019s for sure. Sandler \u2014 or the Sandman to his diehard fans \u2014 has been making audiences laugh for over 30 years. With a unique rage, nice-guy attitude, and magnetic charisma, Sandler is a movie star who uses his powers to make movies with his friends and film in tropical locations. What\u2019s not to like?\nThis year, Sandler will prove once again that he can do more than just comedy when he stars in Jay Kelly, a new coming-of-age dramedy from Noah Baumbach. The initial buzz is that Sandler\u2019s performance could result in the actor\u2019s first Oscar nomination. Frankly, an Oscar nomination for the Sandman is long overdue.\nAdam Sandler is one of the most versatile actors\nIf Sandler could quit acting and play pickup basketball every day for the rest of his life, something tells me he would consider that offer. This is a man who wears the baggiest basketball shorts as much as humanly possible.\nTo describe Sandler\u2019s acting in basketball terms, he\u2019s a point center. Sandler can do it all as an actor. Comedy is obviously his sweet spot. Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Mr. Deeds, and The Waterboy are pantheon movies to a certain generation. Throw in his Saturday Night Live accomplishments and his successful stand-up career, and you get a top-tier comedic resume.\nThere\u2019s a popular belief that it\u2019s easier for comedic actors to do drama than vice versa. Sandler is a shining example of that theory. Could you see Daniel Day-Lewis in Little Nicky or Leonardo DiCaprio in You Don\u2019t Mess with the Zohan? As amusing as that sounds, the answer is no.\nThere\u2019s a much better success rate if Sandler stars in Phantom Thread or Catch Me If You Can. A graduate of NYU\u2019s Tisch School, Sandler knows a thing or two about scene study and character development.\nSandler is truly one of the only actors who can work in every genre \u2014 Comedy (see above), family outings (Click, Bedtime Stories, and Just Go with It), melodramas (Funny People and Spanglish), rom-coms (The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, and Punch-Drunk Love), animation (Hotel Transylvania and Leo), thrillers (Uncut Gems), and dramas (The Meyerowitz Stories, Hustle, and Spaceman).\nIf you work long enough, you\u2019re going to have some clunkers. Surely, Sandler would be OK with removing Jack and Jill from his resume. Then again, maybe he doesn\u2019t because the movie made $149 million and he got to work with Al Pacino. Every Hall of Fame player has a bad game, just like every actor has a bad movie from time to time.\nTop directors constantly want to work with Sandler\nThe top talent always wants to work with the best directors. A true judge of talent is to see the list of great directors who go out of their way to work with a certain actor. Ask any of the best directors, and they\u2019ll swear by Sandler and his capabilities.\nComing off the success of Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson could make anything he wanted. For his next movie, the American auteur gave himself two requirements: make a 90-minute film and cast Sandler as the lead. Punch-Drunk Love, an unorthodox rom-com about an angry loner looking for love, garnered some of the best reviews of Sandler\u2019s career.\nAcademy Award winner James L. Brooks watched Punch-Drunk Love, loved Sandler\u2019s performance, and cast him as the lead in Spanglish, a romantic dramedy about a housekeeper who moves in with a successful chef and his family. Although Spanglish received mixed reviews, Sandler garnered praise for his nuanced performance, further proving he can successfully balance comedy and drama.\nJudd Apatow is arguably the most prolific comedy director and producer of the aughts. For his third directorial feature, Apatow crafted a story about a man facing his mortality in Funny People. Sandler plays George Simmons, a dying comedian who mentors an up-and-comer (Seth Rogen). Despite being a tad too long, Sandler\u2019s performance is heartfelt and honest, another indication that there\u2019s more to the actor than poop jokes.\nJust ask the Safdie Brothers how much Sandler means to them. They\u2019ll probably go on for five hours on Happy Gilmore alone. The Safdies unlocked Sandler\u2019s wild side in Uncut Gems, a chaotic thriller about a jewelry salesman who attempts to dig himself out of debt through sports gambling. The anxiety-inducing performance from Sandler should have resulted in an Oscar nomination (more on that later).\nDo you know who won the Oscar that year? Joaquin Phoenix for Joker. Considering what happened in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, perhaps the Academy wants a redo.\nThe \u2018It\u2019s Time\u2019 narrative for Jay Kelly\n\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Every awards season, there is an \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d campaign, where the voting body decides that now is the right moment to award an actor with praise and recognition. This idea can have multiple meanings. It could go to the actor with multiple nominations and no wins. DiCaprio is the perfect example. DiCaprio received four acting nominations before finally winning for The Revenant, a performance that might not crack his top five.\nAlso, the \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d campaign could be for an actor who has never received a nomination despite years of success. Look at Demi Moore, who received her first Oscar nomination 40 years into her career for The Substance.\nThis year, Sandler will be the prime candidate to run on an \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d campaign for Jay Kelly. Directed by Baumbach, Jay Kelly stars George Clooney as the titular Jay Kelly, an aging movie star who reflects on his life during an unexpected journey through Europe. Sandler plays Ron, Jay\u2019s devoted manager who has been there every step of the way.\nJay Kelly premiered at the Venice Film Festival to mostly positive reviews, with Sandler\u2019s performance cited as the standout. Sandler\u2019s nuanced and quieter performance in a film from an acclaimed director feels like the type of role the Academy will love. Gold Derby has Sandler ranked first in their supporting actor Oscar predictions. Backed by the unlimited marketing budget of Netflix, Sandler should receive a huge awards campaign, deservedly so.\nMost people have recognized the Sandman\u2019s acting expertise for decades. It\u2019s time for the Academy to do the same.\nJay Kelly opens in select theaters on November 14, 2025. It will then stream globally on Netflix on December 5."

      "text": "There are few absolutely perfect comedies. In some ways, making a comedy movie is harder than any other genre, especially as the years pass and any particular references start to feel more and more stale. That\u2019s what makes Clueless feel a little bit like a miracle.\nThis Amy Heckerling classic, which is turning 30 this year, is one of the best comedies ever made, and an absolute must-watch whether you\u2019ve seen it 30 times or never before. An adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma set in Beverly Hills in 1995, the movie is both totally of its time and utterly timeless. Here are three reasons it\u2019s worth checking out:\nIt\u2019s so, so funny\nThe best reason to watch Clueless is because it is one of the funniest scripts ever written. Heckerling, who wrote the film in addition to directing it, made Alicia Silverstone\u2019s Cher an instantly iconic character. Silverstone\u2019s Cher is a privileged popular girl, but she\u2019s textured to be something more engrossing, which makes her funnier.\nIt\u2019s different than the stereotypes you might be expecting. Every minute of this movie has a great joke in it, and you\u2019re going to catch and laugh at different ones every time. \u201cI thought they declared peace in the Middle East.\u201d If only, Cher.\nIt\u2019s a lush, beautiful movie\nComedy movies typically don\u2019t get the kind of directorial flair that you might find in more serious projects, but Clueless is the perfect marriage of laughs and craft. The movie\u2019s iconic costuming \u2014 you can probably picture several outfits from the movie without thinking that hard \u2014 is just an exaggeration of how kids were actually dressing at the time.\nThe colors themselves are also incredibly vibrant, creating a version of Beverly Hills that feels like a middle ground between utter fantasy and the dreariness of something more realistic.\nIt\u2019s genuinely moving\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about Clueless is that the movie manages to land all of its emotional moments. Cher\u2019s character arc is a relatively small journey. Cher goes from being slightly narcissistic to caring a little bit more about other people and the world in general.\nWhat\u2019s crucial to the movie\u2019s success is that lack of \u201cbad guys.\u201d All of these characters are just young people trying to figure out how to get through their lives and high school without totally falling apart. Cher\u2019s realization that she\u2019s in love with her stepbrother is cute and represents a moment when she finally figures out what she wants out of her life. It\u2019s a lovely moment, and one that Silverstone and Paul Rudd totally sell.\nYou can watch Clueless on Netflix."

      "text": "Most Amazon Prime Video users use the streaming service for its expansive library of movies. For example, Pulp Fiction, a movie that changed Hollywood, is now streaming on Prime Video.\nHowever, the streamer will release original movies nearly every month. August has two noteworthy titles: The Pickup, an action comedy featuring a legendary actor, and The Map That Leads to You, a romantic dramedy headlined by two ascending stars.\nYou\u2019ll find those three movies and more in our Prime Video guide.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\nThe Pickup (2025)\nEddie Murphy and Pete Davidson form a reluctant team in the action comedy The Pickup. Armored truck driver Russell is partnered with rookie Travis (Davidson) for what should be an easy job. The duo is ambushed by master criminal Zoe (Keke Palmer) and her team of goons.\nZoe forces Russell and Travis to help execute a casino heist that will net her $60 million. For Russell, getting through the shift with Travis is difficult enough. Add in the fact that he must work for a thief, and Russell is in for a long day of surprises.\nThe Map That Leads to You (2025)\nOuter Banks\u2019 Madelyn Cline and Riverdale\u2019s KJ Apa play two young lovers on a European excursion in The Map That Leads to You. While on a train with her two best friends, Heather (Cline) meets the handsome Jack (Apa). The two hit it off and embark on a journey to visit a list of places Jack\u2019s grandfather wrote about in a journal.\nAs their time together comes to an end, Heather and Jack must decide if their connection can survive while separated halfway across the world. The Map That Leads to You premieres on August 20 on Prime Video.\nPulp Fiction (1994)\nQuentin Tarantino changed cinema forever with his groundbreaking crime saga Pulp Fiction. Told via nonlinear narrative, Pulp Fiction depicts several interconnected stories scattered across Los Angeles.\nOne of the vignettes follows two hitmen, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), who work for gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). In another segment, Vincent must take Marsellus\u2019 wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), to dinner. Meanwhile, boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) finds himself in a precarious situation.\nThe Accountant 2 (2025)\nOne of the world\u2019s most brilliant minds, who moonlights as a vigilante, returns for a sequel in The Accountant 2. Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an accountant for some of the world\u2019s most nefarious criminals. When the body of Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is found with \u201cfind the accountant\u201d on his arm, U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) asks Christian to help find the killer.\nKing was trying to track down a Salvadoran family and went to an assassin for help. Christian can\u2019t do this job alone, so he recruits his mercenary brother Brax (Jon Bernthal) as backup. The ensuing investigation leads to an organization of killers who will do anything to keep their secrets buried. Unfortunately for this criminal ring, they are going up against two highly skilled soldiers in Christian and Brax.\nWicked (2024)\nThe Tony Award-winning stage musical finally received its long-awaited feature film adaptation. Directed by Jon M. Chu, Wicked follows the lives of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), a green-skinned introvert, and Galinda (Ariana Grande), the bubbly social butterfly. These two opposites form an unlikely friendship at Shiz University in the Land of Oz.\nAfter a tumultuous meeting with the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum), the two women go down different paths, as Elphaba becomes the Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda assumes the mantle of Glinda the Good. Wicked is the first of a two-part adaptation. Part two, Wicked: For Good, premieres later in 2025.\nThe Fire Inside (2024)\nThe Fire Inside is based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist, Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields (Ryan Destiny), the first American woman to do so in boxing\u2026 twice. That\u2019s not a spoiler for the movie, because Claressa\u2019s Olympic triumph isn\u2019t the ultimate destination, it\u2019s just a stop along the way. The film movingly conveys Claressa\u2019s connection with her coach, Jason Crutchfield (Bryan Tyree Henry), and there\u2019s an understated bond between them. As much as Claressa has to fight her battles in the ring, she\u2019s got a lot of struggles in her daily life as well. Winning Olympic gold hasn\u2019t given Claressa the access to endorsements or lucrative deals that could pull her up to another level. All she ultimately has is her faith in herself and the support of the people closest to her.\nHomefront (2013)\nJason Statham doesn\u2019t always get surrounded by a strong supporting cast in his action flicks, but he\u2019s got a good lineup of colleagues with him in Homefront. Statham plays Phil Broker, a former DEA agent who has retired to raise his daughter, Maddy Broker (Izabela Vidovic), in peace.\nThat peace doesn\u2019t last long as Phil runs afoul of Cassie Bodine (Kate Bosworth), the mother of one of Maddy\u2019s classmates. Cassie enlist her brother, Morgan \u201cGator\u201d Bodine (James Franco), to get Phil out of the way. And through Gator, Phil\u2019s location is leaked to some of the most dangerous men he put away in the DEA.\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023)\nEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Grace (Hayley Atwell) have a meet-cute in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning that\u2019s worthy of any rom-com. They might have even had a romantic spark if she wasn\u2019t trying to steal something he needs to save the world. Regardless, Ethan and Grace spend a lot of time joined at the wrist \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 because Ethan\u2019s racing against time to stop an AI known as The Entity.\nThis time, even the U.S. government doesn\u2019t want Ethan and his team to succeed, because if America can control The Entity then it will control the future. All of the other countries have the same mentality, but The Entity is the one really in control. And its reach extends to the real world, where it forces Ethan to make life-and-death decisions. He knows The Entity needs to be destroyed, but it may already be too late for that.\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)\nShia LaBeouf has one of his most moving performances in The Peanut Butter Falcon, which casts him as a crab catcher named Tyler. After literally burning his bridges with his former colleagues, Tyler hides out in the wilderness for their retribution. That\u2019s where he meets Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down syndrome who is also on the run after escaping a facility.\nZak and Tyler emotionally bond, and they decide to stick together to help the former achieve his dream of learning how to wrestle under the legendary Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church). Eleanor (Dakota Johnson), the woman in charge of Zak\u2019s medical care, pursues the duo because she truly cares about Zak\u2019s well-being. And when she sees how well Zak and Tyler are together, she has to question whether bringing Zak home is the right move.\nAnother Simple Favor (2025)\nAfter the events of A Simple Favor, Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) would have to be crazy to have anything to do with Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) ever again. Crazy or desperate. Stephanie\u2019s blip of fame since sending Emily to prison is largely burned out in Another Simple Favor. When Emily is released from prison and invites Stephanie to her destination wedding in Italy, she reluctantly accepts.\nStephanie isn\u2019t the only one from Emily\u2019s old life invited to the wedding. Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sean Townsend (Henry Golding), and her mother, Margaret McLanden (Elizabeth Perkins), also made the trip. Regardless, Stephanie is expecting a double cross from Emily. And she\u2019s right to be suspicious, but the dangerous twist won\u2019t necessarily come the way she expects.\nConclave (2024)\nThe pope is dead in Conclave, meaning his successor must be chosen. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), the dean of the College of Cardinals, will oversee the election of the next pope. And it\u2019s more than just a choice between the four major candidates. Whoever is chosen will shape the future of the Catholic Church itself.\nThe election may take place behind closed doors in Vatican City, but the secrets that emerge could end the careers of some and potentially spark more scandal in the church. There\u2019s a surprising amount of intrigue in the selection process, and the film also boasts a stellar supporting cast that includes Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini.\nGladiator II (2024)\nIt only took 24 years for a sequel to Gladiator to reach theaters. Russell Crowe\u2019s character remains dead, but Lucius Verus Aurelius (Paul Mescal) carries on the tradition of losing his family and being sold into slavery in Gladiator II. Connie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucilla from the first film, and she was the one who sent Lucius away for his own safety.\nIn Lucius\u2019 absence, Rome is ruled by not one but two mad emperors: Geta (Joseph Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). As Lucius climbs the ranks of the gladiators, a former slave named Macrinus (Denzel Washington) wants to use him to get the emperors out of the way. But Lucius is his own man, like his father before him.\nG20 (2025)\nAction hero Presidents aren\u2019t a new thing, but Viola Davis\u2019 character in G20 might be the first female action hero president. As far as President Danielle Sutton (Davis) knew, this year\u2019s G20 summit in South Africa was supposed to be an ordinary meeting of leaders from across the globe.\nThe Boys\u2018 Antony Starr co-stars in the film as Rutledge, the leader of the terrorists who take the security team by surprise and capture the world leaders. President Sutton manages to get free. And if she wants to save her family and her fellow leaders, then she\u2019ll need to get her hands dirty and do it herself.\nVal (2021)\nEven years before Val Kilmer became a star in Hollywood, he kept home movies from his childhood to his teens and beyond. It was the story of Kilmer\u2019s life that no one had seen until directors Ting Poo and Leo Scott put it all together as Val.\nThis documentary is also a family affair for Kilmer, his ex-wife Joanne Whalley, and their children, Mercedes and Jack. Since Kilmer had lost his voice during his battle with throat cancer, Jack Kilmer stepped in to read the words written by his father as he looked back at everything he went through to become the man he wanted to be.\nHolland (2025)\nWhat\u2019s eating Nancy Vandergroot (Nicole Kidman) in Holland? She\u2019s got a great thing going in this small town with overtly Dutch roots. Nancy\u2019s got a fine husband, Fred Vandergroot (Matthew Macfadyen), and their son, Harry (Jude Hill), is unusually well-behaved.\nIt\u2019s so perfect that the slightest imperfection alerts Nancy that maybe things aren\u2019t so rosy after all. For an optometrist, Fred sure takes a lot of out-of-town trips. Nancy\u2019s pretty sure that means Fred\u2019s having an affair, and she turns to her new friend, Dave Delgado (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), to help her prove it. What they find isn\u2019t what Nancy expected, which turns her world upside down.\nTransformers One (2024)\nTransformers One is the origin story of the franchise\u2019s leading hero and villain: Optimus Prime and Megatron. At this point in their history, Optimus is known as Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth), while the future Megatron is D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry). Both are miners on Cybertron, and good friends as well.\nAfter befriending B-127 (Keegan-Michael Key) and their former boss, Elita-1 (Scarlett Johansson), Orion and D-16 discover that Cybertron\u2019s ruler, Sentinal Prime (Jon Hamm), has betrayed the planet to their enemies. Orion and D-16 are both outraged by this revelation, but they aren\u2019t on the same page about how to handle it. That leads to the beginning of a rift between them that will have dire consequences for the future.\nTwisters (2024)\nThe new Superman, David Corenswet, has a small role in Twisters, which may be significant years down the line. But he\u2019s not the prime attraction here, and neither are Daisy Edgar-Jones or Glen Powell, the two topline stars who have top billing. Instead, it\u2019s the tornadoes themselves that are the stars of Twisters, especially when the film veers into cartoonish levels of destruction.\nYears ago, storm chaser Kate Carter (Edgar-Jones) had a radical idea that tornadoes could be potentially weakened through her experimental method. When the experiment fails, Kate and Javi (Anthony Ramos) are the only survivors from their team. In the present, Javi lures Kate out of retirement to retry her experiment. While back in the field, Kate encounters a YouTube storm chaser, Tyler Owens (Powell), whom she initially dislikes. When the chips are down and the winds are blowing, Kate will be glad to have Tyler on her side.\nThe Accountant (2016)\nThe Accountant 2 is coming very soon, so it\u2019s worth revisiting the original film ahead of time. Ben Affleck plays the unnamed title character in The Accountant, and he\u2019s the best criminal accountant that the underworld can buy. The Accountant\u2019s autism helps his mind crunch numbers and detect fraud inside criminal organizations. In other words, he can sniff out a rat who\u2019s stealing money from his fellow crooks.\nHis latest client is Living Robotics, after an internal client, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), uncovers startling irregularities in the company\u2019s records. Co-owner Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart) hired the Accountant to sort things out, but what he discovers is a deadly conspiracy that won\u2019t only target him. Dana will also become a target because she knows too much about the fraud.\nSmile 2 (2024)\nSmile 2 is an unusual sequel in that the events of the first film aren\u2019t really necessary to understand what\u2019s happening in this one. Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) has no idea who Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is or what happened to her in Smile, and the person who unintentionally connects them is a police officer named Joel (Kyle Gallner). Before long, Skye finds herself plagued by the same curse that afflicted Rose and Joel, and she doesn\u2019t know what to make of all of the creepy smiles she sees on everyone\u2019s faces.\nSkye isn\u2019t just some random woman; she\u2019s a pop star on the verge of even greater stardom. But the curse has a way of getting under its victims\u2019 skin and driving them insane. Skye is no exception, and as the curse stalks her wherever she goes, she rapidly loses the ability to tell what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\nPicture This (2025)\nBridgerton\u2018s Simone Ashley leads the cast of Picture This as Pia, a young woman struggling to keep her photography business afloat as her family prepares for the month-long build-up to the wedding of her younger sister, Sonal (Anoushka Chadha).\nDuring one of the wedding events, a spiritual advisor tells Pia that she will find the love and career success that she has always wanted somewhere in the next five dates that she goes on. Pia doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in that prediction, but the thought of it hangs over her head with every romantic encounter that she has. She also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend, Charlie (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who is part of the wedding party on the groom\u2019s side. Seeing Charlie again makes Pia reexamine their relationship, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the prediction about her love life was wrong.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was such a massive hit both in theaters and on streaming that it\u2019s kind of redeemed everything that happened after the first Super Mario Bros. movie. Animation was clearly the way to go for this adaptation, as Mario (Chris Pratt), Luigi (Charlie Day), and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) look like they stepped out of a Nintendo Switch and into a breathtaking video game world.\nThe story serves as an origin for the Mario brothers, as they accidentally find themselves transported to the Mushroom Kingdom just as it\u2019s under attack by Bowser (Jack Black) and his army of Koopa Troopas. When Luigi gets captured by Bowser, Mario has to discover his inner hero alongside Peach and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) as they search for allies in their struggle.\nBlink Twice (2024)\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t have an on-screen role in Blink Twice, Zoe Kravitz made her directorial debut with this movie. Naomi Ackie headlines the cast as Frida, a young woman who scores an exclusive invitation from billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum) to visit his private island alongside her best friend, Jess (Alia Shawkat).\nFrida and Jess are lavished with gifts and attention alongside the other female guests on the island. However, Frida notices that she\u2019s experiencing gaps in her memories. When Jess goes missing, Frida is the only one left who remembers her friend. There\u2019s something sinister going on, and this may not be Frida\u2019s first time on Slater\u2019s private island.\nIn the Land of Saints and Sinners (2023)\nLiam Neeson\u2019s action thrillers are kind of a dime a dozen, but In the Land of Saints and Sinners is one of his best. Neeson plays Finbar Murphy, a World War II veteran living in Ireland during \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in the \u201970s. To support himself, Finbar has started working for a crime boss, Robert McQue (Colm Meaney), as an assassin.\nFinbar also befriends a younger contract killer named Kevin (Game of Thrones\u2018 Jack Gleeson), but one of their mutual targets is the brother of Doireann McCann (Kerry Condon), a formidable woman who won\u2019t back down from her revenge. Doireann is determined to avenge her brother, no matter who she has to kill to do it.\nThe Fall Guy (2024)\nStunt man Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is burned out on Hollywood in The Fall Guy. It\u2019s hard to blame him after witnessing the injuries he suffers early in this movie. Unfortunately, Colt ruined his relationship with Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) while he was torching his bridges to the entertainment industry. Nearly two years later, Colt reenters Jody\u2019s life when she\u2019s gotten the chance to direct her own movie.\nJody isn\u2019t exactly happy to see her ex again, but she needs her help. Her star, Tom Ryder (Kraven the Hunter\u2018s Aaron Taylor-Johnson), has gone missing, and this is more than just an actor on an extended bender. Without Tom, there is no movie to be made, and Jody\u2019s career will be over before it starts. Thus, Colt is drawn into a bigger mystery as he tries to locate Tom and make amends with Jody.\nA Quiet Place: Day One (2024)\nTypically, alien invasion movies involve humanity putting up a fight. But in A Quiet Place: Day One, the battle is over before it even begins, as humans can\u2019t withstand an attack by sightless alien hunters. Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) witnessed the carnage herself while on a day out with her cat in the city.\nSam quickly realizes that her survival hinges on her ability to be quiet. Another survivor, Eric (The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u2018 Joseph Quinn), might be the last friend she ever makes. Sam and Eric must stick together if they want to escape New York City and evade the hunters now roaming the Earth.\nThe Bikeriders (2024)\nThe Bikeriders is loosely based upon the experiences of author Danny Lyon, a character portrayed by Mike Faist in this adaptation. But the film is largely reworked into an original story that focuses on three characters: Kathy (Jodie Comer), her lover, Benny (Austin Butler), and the leader of the Vandals Motorcycle Club, Johnny (Tom Hardy).\nJohnny had high-minded ideals when he founded the club in the 1960s. Over the course of the next decade, Johnny and his friends are almost unrecognizable in what they\u2019re willing to do for the club. Despite Benny\u2019s love for Kathy, he keeps getting drawn back into Johnny\u2019s vision for the club, even when it may destroy him.\nKnives Out (2019)\nDaniel Craig sheds his James Bond persona like a separate skin in Knives Out. Craig steps into the role of Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc, a man whose accent is just shy of Foghorn Leghorn territory. However, the voice somehow works for this comedic murder mystery. Ana de Armas has a standout turn as Marta Cabrera, the loyal housekeeper of a wealthy author, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).\nAfter Harlan dies, his spoiled extended family is stunned to discover that his entire fortune has been left to Marta. The family does not know that Harlan was murdered. Plus, Marta is horrified to discover that the evidence points back to her just as Blanc begins his investigation.\nAbigail (2024)\nScream\u2018s Melissa Barrera reunites with directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett for Abigail, a film that is very much unlike her previous genre movies. Barrera plays Joey, a military veteran who has hit hard times. That\u2019s why she agreed to work with Frank (Dan Stevens) and a group of other criminals to kidnap a young girl named Abigail (Alisha Weir).\nJoey tries to form a connection with Abigail to assure the young girl that she will remain safe before learning that the latter is the daughter of a dangerous crime lord, Kristof Lazaar (Matthew Goode). However, the greatest threat to the kidnappers is Abigail herself, because she\u2019s more than she appears to be. When Abigail strikes, it\u2019s lethal.\nMonkey Man (2024)\nDev Patel made his directorial debut with Monkey Man, a film in which he also stars as the main character. And despite the title, Patel\u2019s character doesn\u2019t actually transform into a monkey or even go by that name. The audience only knows him as Kid, a man who will do anything to get his revenge on Rana Singh (Sikandar Kher), the corrupt police chief who murdered his mother.\nKid does wear a monkey mask when he\u2019s in the ring for an underground fighting circuit. However, his real disguise is pretending to be an ordinary waiter at a high-end brothel so he can rise through the ranks and get close enough to assassinate Rana no matter what his vengeance costs him.\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\nArt the Clown (David Howard Thornton) is back for another round of terror in Terrifier 2. Some evil entity has resurrected Art yet again, and he goes on another rampage. A teenager named Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is haunted by dreams of Art and she\u2019s convinced that her late father knew how to stop the clown once and for all.\nArt must sense the same thing, since he kidnaps Sienna\u2019s brother, Jonathan (Elliott Fullam), and terrorizes their family. Now, Sienna has to save her brother, but first, she must live through her encounter with Art.\nChallengers (2024)\nYou may have to pay close attention to Challengers, because the story doesn\u2019t take place in chronological order. Zendaya stars as Tashi Duncan, a rising tennis star romantically drawn to two other players on the pro tour: Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor) and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist).\nBoth young men want Tashi for themselves, but only one of them is willing to play dirty to get her. Even when one of them wins Tashi\u2019s heart, it doesn\u2019t end the romantic entanglement between this trio as their lives unfold and intersect over several years. Ultimately, the battle between these two men is going to come back to the place where it all began: on the tennis court.\nSnack Shack (2024)\nSnack Shack is a coming-of-age comedy set in 1991. A.J. Carter (Conor Sherry) and his friend, Moose Miller (Gabriel LaBelle), are 14-year-olds whose schemes to get money almost always backfire on them. At least until they hit upon the idea of running the local Snack Shack for the summer.\nTheir bond of friendship is tested when A.J. meets Brooke, his attractive new neighbor. Because Moose makes the first move on Brooke, this creates tension between him and A.J., who isn\u2019t willing to simply back off. As Brooke begins to reciprocate A.J.\u2019s feelings, his friendship and lucrative partnership with Moose may come crashing down.\nBob Marley: One Love (2024)\nBob Marley: One Love is a music biopic that takes place late in the life of reggae superstar Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir). After Bob and his wife, Rita Marley (The Marvels actress Lashana Lynch), narrowly survive an assassination attempt in his native Jamaica, it sends him into a creative tailspin that threatens to derail his dreams.\nBefore Bob can resume his message of peace, he has to face his own inner demons and work out his issues with Rita. Bob Marley didn\u2019t have a lot of time in this world, but the film shows that he made the most of what he had and left a lasting legacy of music behind.\nAmerican Fiction (2023)\nAmerican Fiction casts The Batman Part Two\u2019s Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Thelonious \u201cMonk\u201d Ellison, a college professor and a novelist whose books sell very poorly. Monk is also upset that another writer, Sinatra Golden (Issa Rae), has found massive success while seemingly pandering to Black stereotypes. So Monk writes his own novel as a satire of Golden\u2019s books before submitting it for publication.\nMuch to Monk\u2019s surprise and horror, his satire is embraced by the publisher and the general public. The satire of the piece goes unnoticed, as the book becomes so popular that it starts taking over Monk\u2019s life, even though he made sure that his real name wasn\u2019t listed as the author. But once the book is out and Hollywood comes knocking, it may be too late.\nThe Idea of You (2024)\nThe irony of the premise of The Idea of You is that the romantic entanglement of Sol\u00e8ne Marchand (Eileen\u2018s Anne Hathaway) with boy band lead singer Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine) would probably be more of a fantasy for Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), than for Sol\u00e8ne herself. But one unplanned encounter between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes soon leads to several others.\nThere is an age gap between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes that does come up in the film, but the bigger issue between them is the celebrity gap. As long as Hayes is a world-famous musician, he and Sol\u00e8ne may never be able to enjoy a normal romance without being hounded by the press.\nRoad House (2024)\nIn this remake of the popular 1989 movie starring Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Elwood Dalton as a former UFC fighter who has fallen on some hard times. Road House gives Elwood a chance for redemption when Frankie (Jessica Williams) recruits him to be the bouncer at her bar, which shares its name with the title of the film.\nElwood\u2019s fighting skills go a long way towards keeping order at The Road House, much to the anger of a local mobster, Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen). Elwood took care of Brandt\u2019s regular goons with ease, but he\u2019ll have a much harder time handling Knox, an enforcer for Brandt who is played by an actual UFC fighter, Conor McGregor.\nThe Other Zoey (2023)\nThe Other Zoey is not a remake of the Sandra Bullock rom-com While You Were Sleeping. But romantic comedy fans may notice some similarities between the two. Josephine Langford stars as Zoey Miller, a high school student who is definitely not the girlfriend of soccer star Zach MacLaren (Drew Starkey), whose girlfriend is also named Zoey (Maggie Thurmon).\nWhen Zach suffers a head injury that gives him partial amnesia, he mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend, and his doctors warn her not to upset him with the truth. So Zoey carries on the deception and gets closer to Zach on a lavish vacation. At the same time, Zoey also feels attracted to Zach\u2019s cousin, Miles Maclaren (Archie Renaux), who shares many of her views about love and life. So, which guy does Zoey really want? You\u2019ll have to watch the film to find out."
