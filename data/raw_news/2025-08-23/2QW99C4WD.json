  "title": "How Tennis Hall Of Fame Inductee Maria Sharapova Built Personal Brand",
  "description": "Maria Sharapova, who is being inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, was one of the first female athletes to redefine personal branding.",
  "content": "When Maria Sharapova is inducted into the 2025 Class of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, her five Grand Slam titles, No. 1 ranking, and silver medal in the 2012 Olympics will be the athletic accomplishments lauded. However, what kept Sharapova in the spotlight, and on Forbes\u2019 highest-paid female athlete list for 11 years, was personal branding.\n\n\u201cMaria was the first athlete to really have a brand marketing campaign,\u201d said Stacey Allaster, Chief Executive of Professional Tennis at the USTA and U.S. Open tournament director, in an interview with the Tennis Channel earlier this week. \u201cInstead of just doing, you know, sponsorships, endorsements, I\u2019ll take equity and that started a much longer entrepreneurial experience for Maria.\u201d\n\nRussian tennis player Anna Kournikova preceded Sharapova in raking in more cash in endorsements than prize money. However, Sharapova pioneered a new model of entrepreneurship, reshaping how female athletes leverage their success into lucrative business deals that last beyond their post-sports careers.\n\n\u201cNow as a mother of a 3-year-old, leading businesses and investments, I have a very different perspective, and my everyday routine is very different, but I still get to carry all the disciplines of my sport,\u201d said Sharapova in a press conference at the ITHF. \u201cThe lessons that I learned throughout the years are applied every single day. I'm just so grateful for them, because I feel like I still in every venture and especially as a mom, the patience, the tenacity, you know, being able to pivot at any moment are all things that I got to learn for so many years on the job every day.\u201d\n\nSharapova catapulted to stardom when she upset Serena Williams at the 2004 Wimbledon Championships. A fresh-faced 17-year-old, Sharapova, like Kournakova, was Russian, tall, blonde and spoke impeccable English, Madison Avenue\u2019s dream.\n\nSharapova could have easily gone the Kournikova route, content to pocket as much endorsement money as possible. However, her agent, Max Eisenberg, helped the budding star develop a brand strategy, one partially borrowed from golfer Tiger Woods.\n\n\u201cMark Steinberg was a colleague of mine who worked on the 13th floor (at IMG), so I spent a lot of time with him to figure out how Tiger was managing his deals. What he\u2019d like to do is take three weeks of the year to do his shoots, he would do five shoots a week in those weeks,\" Einsenberg told Andy Roddick in a 2024 podcast interview.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, by the end of 2005, Sharapova had seven-figure contracts with Motorola, Canon, TAG Heuer, Colgate and Land Rover. She also inked an eight-year deal with Nike that included royalties from her signature ballet flat, which was then part of Nike-owned Cole Haan.\n\nEinsenberg had Sharapova seek equity, not just endorsements.\n\nWinning is an athlete\u2019s key to brand building. The reason people wanted to \u201cbe like Mike\u201d was because Michael Jordan kept winning. Tiger, Peyton Manning, and Simone Biles make better pitch people because they are champions.\n\nDuring her pre-induction press conference, a reporter asked Sharapova how she might navigate her career in the age of social media, when tennis players are also influencers.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately you can\u2019t forget what your core work is, what your core mission is,\u201d said Sharapova. \u201cI think we can all agree that the more that these players win, the more opportunities they'll get, and what they choose to do with their opportunities is a very individual choice.\u201d\n\nSharapova also spoke about the need to balance business opportunities with championship goals.\n\n\u201cI understand both sides of it, because you want to maximize your earnings, and you want to maximize your potential, but you also want to preserve your quality, and your quality is what makes you a champion,\u201d said Sharapova.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this is a business, and Maria is the CEO of Sharapova Inc, as Venus is of Venus Williams, Inc, and Serena and Naomi, and the list goes on and on,\u201d said Allaster. \u201cAnd the one thing about all of these champions, number one, you\u2019ve got to win on the court first, and then the business will take care of itself, and that requires a lot of discipline.\u201d\n\nSharapova CEO Of Her Image And Likeness\n\nLong before NIL, TikTok, and influencers, Sharapova went the Oprah route of building a brand in the male-dominated business world. She delegates duties, but not control of her image and brand. Sharapova closely monitored her investments and business ventures.\n\n\"When you\u2019re the one that\u2019s actually paying a bill, when you\u2019re saying yes or no, that\u2019s challenging,\" Sharapova said in a Forbes interview in 2016. \"But isn't that the position that we want?\"\n\nOne of the ways Sharapova developed her business acumen was by attending meetings with executives, even in her early 20s.\n\n\u201cThere were so many brands that I worked, and I was actually in the meetings with them learning from these incredibly talented individuals. I got to selfishly learn from them and kind of grow my own knowledge,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019ve always identified many parallels in business with sport. They\u2019re both very team-oriented. They\u2019re very competitive,\" she said. \u201cYou don't have that match point feel, but God, when you get a deal done, it's a pretty special feeling.\u201d\n\nIn January, 2016, Sharapova held a press conference to announce that she had tested positive for a banned substance. Suddenly, $30 million in endorsement deals was on the line.\n\nThe unexpected press conference had tennis fans and sports journalists speculating that Sharapova might be retiring. Sharapova used those rumors to lighten the mood ahead of announcing she\u2019d tested positive.\n\n\u201cIf I was going to announce my retirement, it would not be in a hotel with this fairly ugly carpet,\" she said, garnering laughter from the press.\n\nSharapova\u2019s ability to manage her public image was crucial in navigating the worst period of her career. Some sponsors put their relationship with her on hold. A few sponsors dropped her. But Sharapova got out in front of the story, created a narrative of innocence based on ignorance.\n\nDespite serving a 15-month ban, Sharapova weathered the doping scandal. She never went into hiding. She graced red carpets and showed up at Vanity Fair Oscar parties with Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and other tennis greats.\n\nThe Tennis Hall of Fame mentions the drug ban on Sharapova\u2019s biography, but the subject doesn\u2019t come up in the many celebratory interviews. It\u2019s business as usual for one of tennis\u2019 most notable brand ambassadors.\n\n\u201cI never felt overwhelmed, because I knew where my ultimate passion was, but I also knew that as a woman, I had a certain time frame. I was very well aware of that from a young age,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cI made a conscious effort of setting up meetings from a very early age to make sure that I had a foundation as strong as it possibly could to set me up for the next stage of my life.\u201d",

      "text": "Bethany Mota didn't set out to be a YouTube star. There was no such thing when she was 13 years old, sitting in her California bedroom, making videos about her favorite fashion and beauty finds and posting them to the internet as 'Macbarbie07'.\nSeven years later, at 20, Mota's YouTube channel boasts over 10 million subscribers. She's one of the most sought-after 'influencers' for brands looking to reach young women. She's parlayed partnerships with Forever 21 and JC Penney into her own line with mall store Aeropostale. And she has a book coming out in March.\n\"What I do, there's not really a blueprint for it,\" Mota told an audience of young entrepreneurs at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in Boston on Tuesday afternoon. \"I kind of just have to wing it and trust myself.\"\nShe and fellow marketing mastermind Maria Sharapova spoke of brand-building in the social media age, when your audience expects authenticity -- as well as fresh content on every platform, from Snapchat to Twitter.\nTennis champion Sharapova was reluctant to share too much of her life online as she built and grew Sugarpova, her premium line of gummy candies.\n\"So much of my life was already on a public level,\" she said, adding that her fans have watched her compete on TV for years. Her policy: not to over-post, and to be thoughtful about scheduling to avoid, say, promoting two partnerships too close together.\nFor Mota, social media feedback helped when she set out to design her Aeropostale line. She'd post 30 second YouTube videos, updating her many fans on her progress.\n\"I brought my audience along on this journey,\" she said. \"It's something we created together. If you can make the consumer or the audience part of it, you can't not support that. There's this emotional connection attached to it.\"\nDespite her success, Mota knows her brand is predicated on relatability. If she loses her girl-next-door accessibility, she sacrifices her following. While her videos may have a higher production value than they did when she was a young teen, she still films many of them in her bedroom. She announced her upcoming book, a memoir and self-help guide, on her YouTube channel.\nSharapova also has a book coming soon: her autobiography will be on shelves in 2017. She'll also be back on the tennis tournament circuit in April, having seen her two-year doping ban reduced to 15 months.\nSugarpova keeps her busy when she isn't training; the company just started selling chocolate in addition to prettily-presented gummies, and truffles will be launched in the next few months.\nShe told the audience of entrepreneurs that she's struggled to feel comfortable calling the shots in a business setting, where she's mostly surrounded by men, and where she's often the youngest person in the room at age 29.\n\"When you're the one that's actually paying a bill, when you're saying yes or no, that's challenging,\" Sharapova said. \"But isn't that the position that we want?\""

She called taking the banned substance, which was found during a drug test at the Australian Open, \u201ca huge mistake.\u201d\nAccording to the 2015 Forbes list of highest-paid female athletes, Sharapova came in the top spot as the best-earning female athlete in the world with an income of $29.7 million \u2013 and that for the eleventh year running.

      "text": "Serena Williams heads to New York this month for the U.S. Open on a historic roll. She has won the past four Grand Slam events to complete the \u201cSerena Slam\u201d for the second time in her career. She has lost only once on the court in 41 matches this year (she\u2019s withdrawn in the middle of three events for injuries). Her $9.1 million in prize money during the first seven months of the year is more than tennis legend Chris Evert and all but 35 female tennis players made over their entire careers.\nBut for all of her brilliance on the court, Williams still looks up at rival Maria Sharapova when measuring their bank accounts. Williams earned $24.6 million from prize money and endorsements between June 2014 and June 2015, while Sharapova banked $29.7 million. Sharapova is the world\u2019s highest-paid female athlete for the 11th straight year.\nSharapova bounced back from injuries in 2013 to win her second French Open title last year and her fifth Grand Slam overall. Her $6.7 million in prize money is almost triple what it was in the previous 12 months. The Roland Garros win also kicked in valuable bonuses from sponsors\nSharapova launched her own candy line, Sugarpova, in 2012. Sales doubled in the past year to more than three million bags of candy and the brand is now available in more than 30 countries. The Russian-born tennis star wants to turn Sugarpova into a lifestyle brand with clothing and accessories. She launched the Official Maria Sharapova App in March to provide fans a behind-the-scenes look at her life on and off the court. She is already the top female athlete and tennis player on Facebook with 15 million fans.\nWilliams continues to dominate her sport at an age when most players have hung up their rackets. At 33 years old, she is the oldest player to hold the No. 1 ranking with Evert the previous record holder at 30 in 1985. In July, Williams had twice as many rankings points as the current No. 2 player, Sharapova. This was a first in WTA history. Williams\u2019 career prize money of $72.7 million since she turned pro twenty years ago is twice as much as Sharapova (Serena\u2019s sister Venus ranks third overall with $31 million).\nWilliams is arguably the greatest female athlete of all-time, but sponsors have often eschewed the 21-time Grand Slam singles champ. Williams\u2019 skin color, muscular body type and one memorable outburst at the U.S. Open in 2009 have all been blamed by pundits for the endorsement gap between Williams and Sharapova. The reality is that there is no one magic answer for the disparity.\nWilliams' endorsement scorecard has picked up as she shoots for the calendar Grand Slam in Flushing, Queens. Williams added deals with Audemars Piguet and\nDanish tennis pro Caroline Wozniacki ranks third with earnings of $14.6 million, including $11 million off the court. She picked up new deals with Godiva chocolates and Lavazza coffee this year. She is the first athlete sponsor ever for Godiva, which approached her after Wozniacki said in a Wall Street Journal article: \u201cI will do a chocolate deal for product only. No need for money.\u201d Wozniacki will get product in the new deal, as well as a mid-six figure check annually in the multi-year pact. Wozniacki, who is tight with Williams, ran the NYC marathon in November and raised more than $80,000 for charity in the process.\nThe first non-tennis player to make the cut is Nascar\u2019s Danica Patrick, who ranks No. 4 with earnings of $13.9 million. Patrick's main sponsor, GoDaddy, announced in April that it was leaving Nascar after the 2015 season. Despite her struggles on the track, Patrick is still a hot commodity in the sport and is expected to return to Stewart-Haas Racing with new sponsors behind her car in 2016. She has been featured in more Super Bowl commercials than other celebrity thanks to GoDaddy.\nThe world\u2019s 10 highest-paid female athletes are a global group with seven different nationalities represented. They earned $124 million collectively from salary, winnings, appearances, licensing and endorsements between June 1, 2014 and June 1, 2015. The total was down 12% as some new blood made the cut this year with the retirement of list-staples Li Na and Kim Yuna, who ranked second and fourth last year respectively. The Chinese tennis star and South Korean Olympic figure skating champion both retired from competition in 2014.\nTennis players dominate the list with seven entries. The revenue disparity between athletes in basketball, soccer and golf is vast with the top 10 male athletes earning $950 million combined over the past 12 months. But tennis is the one sport that generates significant revenue on both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side. The result is near equal prize money in tennis and widespread TV coverage, which attracts sponsors who want athletes getting exposure. Tennis\u2019 demographics are also strong with tennis fans wielding high disposable incomes to spend on equipment, apparel, watches and cars.\nOne newcomer in the top 10 is UFC star Ronda Rousey, who ranks No. 8 with estimated earnings of $6.5 million. The mixed martial arts champion had a breakout year with roles in three big budget movies over the past 12 months, a best-selling autobiography and an appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated (she also showed up in SI\u2019s swimsuit issue). Her endorsement portfolio includes Reebok, Metro PCS, Monster headphones, Buffalo David Bitton and Carl's Jr."

The media and fans were expecting a retirement announcement at a press conference that she had hastily called in Los Angeles, a rumor which Sharapova put to rest with a bit of gallows humor: \u201cIf I was going to announce my retirement, it would not be in a hotel with this fairly ugly carpet.\u201d Sharapova said she had been taking the drug Meldonium for a decade for her health, and unbeknownst to Sharapova it was added to the WTA Tour\u2019s banned list of substances on January 1.\nSharapova, who turns 29 in April, said she was notified of the failed test last week. \u201cI made a huge mistake. I let my fans down, I let the sport down,\u201d she said.\nCredit Sharapova and her PR machine at IMG for getting out ahead of this story before any punishment had been doled out by the WTA Tour. Nonetheless, there is now a question mark over Sharapova due to her use of the anti-ischemic drug, which was banned because its misuse by athletes to increase endurance performance, as well as improve rehabilitation after exercise. Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances as of Jan. 1. If more information emerges that contradicts Sharapova's story that it was an honest mistake, it could jeopardize her standing as the world\u2019s most marketable female athlete.\nBranding expert David Schwab at marketing firm\nThe five-time Grand Slam champion has won 35 WTA titles and in 2012 became just the sixth female player in the Open era to win the career Grand Slam, joining the sport\u2019s legends: Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams.\nFor all of her on-court brilliance, Sharapova has been even better off the court. Sharapova was the world\u2019s highest-paid female athlete last year for the 11th straight year with earnings of $29.7 million, including $23 million from endorsements and appearances. She ranked No. 26, including men, among the top earners in sports.\nSharapova has earned $36.8 million in prize money during her career, which ranks second all-time, but she trails Williams by more nearly $39 million. The real money has been off the court for the 6-foot-2 inch Russian with more than $200 million during her career from endorsements, appearances and royalties, by Forbes\u2019 count.\nNike has been Sharapova\u2019s biggest backer since she was a teen and her world-rank was in the 200s. She has her own line of clothing at the $31-billion sportswear giant. She reaped millions of dollars with her ballet flat, which was the No. 1 female shoe at Nike subsidiary Cole Haan (Nike sold Cole Haan in 2013 and the royalty deal ended for Sharapova). She extended her Nike deal at the start of 2010. The eight-year pact could be worth as much as $70 million, including royalties. Her other current partners include\nSharapova is also expanding her brand beyond the traditional endorsement space. She launched her own gummi candy brand, Suparpova, in 2012 and is adding chocolate this year. Sharapova wants to turn Sugarpova into a lifestyle brand. She hosted her own tennis tournament, Maria Sharapova & Friends, in Los Angeles in December. The two-day exhibition included celebrities and tennis pros.\nSharapova only played in one tournament this year. She lost in the quarterfinals to her longtime on-court nemesis Williams at the Australian Open. It was the 18th straight match where Williams defeated Sharapova. Sharapova, currently ranked No. 7 on the WTA Tour, said on Thursday that she was pulling out of the PNB Paribas Open at Indian Wells due to a left forearm injury."
