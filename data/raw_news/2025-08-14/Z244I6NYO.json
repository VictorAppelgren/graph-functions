  "title": "Inside the Biden Administration's Gamble to Freeze China\u2019s AI Future",
  "description": "What really motivated the US government to ban Nvidia from selling powerful computer chips to China?",
  "content": "Alan Estevez was sitting at his dining room table wearing a t-shirt when Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo called on Zoom to ask if he wanted to be the Biden administration\u2019s top export control official. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to sell me on this,\u201d Estevez recalls telling her. It was 2021, and the outspoken New Jersey native thought he had finally left public service behind. After more than three decades at the Pentagon, he had left and taken a job in consulting. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was ready to go back. Could he be tempted by the opportunity to help oversee the tens of billions of dollars in semiconductor funding the administration was seeking from Congress? \u201cI came from DOD,\u201d he recalls saying. \u201c$50 billion is OK money, but it\u2019s not a lot of money.\u201d Then Raimondo appealed to his sense of service. Estevez gave in and took the job. By the time Estevez was sworn in as under secretary of commerce for industry and security in the spring of 2022, he had his work cut out for him. The role he had accepted would turn out to be at the center of America\u2019s first serious effort to confront the geopolitical risks of artificial intelligence. Within a few years, the project would reshape relations between the world\u2019s two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations. Shortly after he joined the Commerce Department, Estevez says he began hearing from officials in the White House. Over breakfast one morning, Tarun Chhabra and Jason Matheny, two key figures working on technology and national security, told Estevez they were planning something big, and they would be needing his help. Over the next six months, the US government revolutionized its strategy for competing with China, now widely considered the nation\u2019s most important technological rival. For years, US officials had sought to keep China one or two generations behind in semiconductors, the building blocks of modern technology that power everything from smartphones to AI. But now, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan declared that September, \u201cwe must maintain as large of a lead as possible.\u201d On October 7, 2022, the Biden administration announced a sweeping set of export controls designed to cut off China from the most advanced chips used for training powerful AI models, as well as specialized tools that China would need to upgrade its own lagging chipmaking industry. Officially, the controls were intended to throttle China\u2019s military modernization and stem human rights abuses fueled by surveillance technology. But as observers digested the dozens of pages of technical specifications and legalese, it became clear that the implications of the new policy were far more vast. In practice, the United States was delivering a targeted blow that would ripple out across the Chinese economy, impacting research and development in every industry or scientific field that relied on computationally intensive machine learning. Anywhere cutting-edge AI or high-performance computing held promise\u2014futuristic weapons, yes, but also curing disease and modeling climate change\u2014the policy could undermine China. A New York Times writer called it a \u201cdeclaration of economic war.\u201d\n\nWar or not, the Biden administration was placing a high-stakes bet that the United States could use its leverage to hold China back, and that the losses in terms of foregone US exports to China and collateral damage to bilateral ties would be worth it. On one hand, it was a gamble that relied on ideas established in Washington decades ago. US policymakers had been using tech restrictions to stymie China\u2019s military modernization and punish the country for human rights abuses since the Cold War. More recent advancements in missiles and surveillance technology reinforced that logic. But several people who served in the Biden administration say that a more novel concern was also behind the big bet. Key officials believed AI was approaching an inflection point\u2014or several\u2014that could give a nation major military and economic advantages. Some believed a self-improving system or so-called artificial general intelligence could be just over the technical horizon. The risk that China could reach these thresholds first was too great to ignore. This account of how the Biden administration chose to respond is based on interviews with more than 10 former US officials and policy experts, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal government deliberations. When the Biden administration introduced its transformative policy, it did not start from scratch. During his first term, President Donald Trump had also targeted Chinese tech, including semiconductor firms, as part of a broader effort to curb the country\u2019s technological rise and global influence. In 2019, the Commerce Department added the Chinese IT giant Huawei to its Entity List, which effectively cut it off from US supply chains, including chips, unless it got a special license. Officials justified the measure with allegations that Huawei had violated US sanctions on Iran. But experts believed they were also trying to undermine the company more generally, fearing that Huawei\u2019s exports of 5G wireless infrastructure around the world could give Chinese spies and saboteurs a leg up. Then the Trump administration doubled down, this time by turning to an obscure legal provision called the \u201cforeign-produced direct product rule.\u201d The FDPR was originally designed to make sure that goods made through US innovation and technology\u2014like missiles or airplane parts\u2014didn\u2019t go into weapons systems sold to adversaries, even if those systems were built abroad. In 2020, the Trump administration turned this long-arm tool on Huawei, explicitly targeting the company\u2019s \u201cefforts to obtain advanced semiconductors developed or produced from US software and technology,\u201d as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at the time. While the FDPR had previously been used to enforce multilateral arms controls, the move against Huawei targeted \u201citems made with US technology that were not sensitive, that were not on the control list, that had nothing to do with any AI,\u201d says Kevin Wolf, a former Obama administration export control official. \u201cEverybody thought that would be the end of this very novel extraterritorial control,\u201d Wolf added. Instead, the US government found the FDPR irresistible. It would later turn it on Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and eventually wield it to constrain high-powered computing in China. \u201cObviously we started using it like candy,\u201d says Estevez. \u201cCertainly threatening to use it, if not actually using it.\u201d\n\nIn the first Trump administration, the US added Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), a leading Chinese chipmaker, to the Entity List and brought criminal charges against another Chinese semiconductor company, Fujian Jinhua (a judge later found it not guilty). It also worked with the Netherlands, home to the chip-making tool giant ASML, to restrict exports of especially cutting-edge semiconductor equipment. All these moves were, in a way, part of normal business amidst worsening ties between the US and China. They didn\u2019t require visions of advanced AI to make sense in Washington, where traditional concerns about military modernization, rights abuses, and fair markets were more than enough to justify targeted efforts against Chinese tech. When Biden took office in 2021, some members of his policy team brought with them a novel anxiety: AI systems might become so capable that they would supercharge national power, leaving rival militaries and economies at a great disadvantage. In early 2019, when you had to be a bit of a geek to have heard of OpenAI\u2019s early GPT models, Matheny\u2014one of Estevez\u2019s early breakfast partners from the White House\u2014was founding director of the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Essentially a think tank housed inside Georgetown University, CSET was launched with a $55 million grant from Open Philanthropy, a group aligned with the effective altruism movement that funds work addressing issues ranging from \u201cpotential risks from advanced artificial intelligence\u201d to global health. \u201cAI and other emerging technologies will deliver profound benefits to society, but they will also introduce new risks,\u201d Matheny said at the center\u2019s launch. It wasn\u2019t long before CSET scholars identified China\u2019s growing strength in AI development as a US national security risk. Those scholars included Chhabra\u2014the other White House breakfast partner\u2014as well as future Biden administration officials Saif Khan and Ben Buchanan, all of whom studied technology and national security at CSET. Chhabra coauthored a report published in February 2020 that recommended the United States and key allies \u201ccoordinate on the terms under which they will export leading-edge AI chips to China\u201d and \u201cforge a democratic way of AI.\u201d That April, Khan coauthored a separate paper arguing for putting controls on chipmaking equipment to ensure that China remained \u201creliant on democracies for state-of-the-art chips.\u201d In August, just months before Biden was elected president, Buchanan identified computing power as a key input that allows countries to develop AI and warned that the US was likely running out of time before it could no longer restrain China\u2019s access to it. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a research panel created by Congress that included Matheny, also called for \u201cimplementing coordinated export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment with allies.\u201d Chhabra, Matheny, Khan, and Buchanan\u2014four experts with varying backgrounds who crossed paths at CSET\u2014would all go on to work on AI policy in the Biden White House. Once there, they and others, including Chris McGuire, a State Department official who had worked on the final AI Commission report, set to work operationalizing their ideas. One former official recalled that their work to keep advanced chipmaking equipment out of Chinese hands began as early as the transition. The theory was that gatekeeping the tools would ensure there would be no Chinese version of Nvidia and prevent Chinese companies like SMIC from building cutting edge factories. This would, as Khan had advocated, keep Chinese AI developers dependent on US suppliers.\n\nAs the Biden team assembled in 2021, however, its ambitions were broader. Limiting China\u2019s chipmaking abilities would block it from independently building computing power, but Chinese developers could still simply buy the best chips from US companies. As close observers of AI were debating the potential of large language models, no one knew for sure what might be possible in the future with vast quantities of what were then the most powerful chips. Some officials believed that keeping China dependent on US supplies would no longer be enough. It was time, they judged, to build support across the administration for cutting off the chips themselves. Former officials recall being motivated by a combination of different risks. Some say the idea of artificial general intelligence was explicitly on their mind. (While there is no universally accepted definition of AGI, the term generally refers to an AI system superior to humans across all intellectual fields.) Others say they were concerned more about specific AI capabilities, whether things that had already been envisioned\u2014supercharged propaganda, automated cyber hacking, synthetic bioweapons\u2014or ones yet to be foreseen. Others say their worries were not even directly related to AI, pointing to reporting that a Chinese company may have used US software to develop chips that in turn powered a supercomputer used to develop hypersonic missiles for the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The stakes were especially high, some believed, because a powerful AI system might be used to develop even more capable AI systems, compounding a country\u2019s lead and leaving competitors not just incrementally behind, but wallowing in a bygone paradigm. If some of these fears sound vague or far out, that\u2019s because they are. Policymakers, however, are forced to take action in the face of uncertainty, and here, the uncertainty itself was cause for alarm. The prescription that officials came up with to meet this challenge\u2014a broad effort to limit China\u2019s independent access to computing power\u2014would require buy-in from across the federal government, including several cabinet secretaries and the president himself. Not everyone was on board at first. The White House team had identified risks that demanded action, but there would also be costs. Nvidia, one of the crown jewels of US tech, would be banned from selling some of its most lucrative products to an enormous growing market. Producers of chipmaking equipment, such as Applied Materials and Lam Research, would lose the ability to sell their advanced products to Chinese factories. Experts believed that China might still eventually succeed in developing its own independent semiconductor ecosystem, and cutting the country off could motivate actors around the world to build an America-free supply chain to avoid future disruptions. Former White House officials say they worked intensively to understand the potential blowback. The Chinese government\u2019s reaction to the move would clearly be negative, but no one could know what form it would take. Would Beijing target iconic US firms like Apple? Cut off supplies of critical minerals? If China retaliated hard, what options would Washington have?\n\nThen there were the specifics. How would the policy distinguish between equipment that really posed a risk, and products companies should still be able to sell? Estevez says he remembers the White House pushed for restrictions on a larger number of items, while the Commerce Department, which is responsible for promoting economic growth, sought a more tailored approach. \u201cTrying to hold China back is a fool\u2019s errand,\u201d Raimondo, the Commerce secretary, told The Wall Street Journal toward the end of Biden\u2019s term, describing export controls as mere \u201cspeed bumps\u201d for China. Yet the administration kept plowing forward. Several former officials specifically cited Chhabra\u2019s bureaucratic skill and determination as central to making the chip strategy happen. \u201cAmerican technology should not enable adversaries to build AI capabilities that will be turned against American troops, strategic assets, and critical infrastructure,\u201d says Chhabra, now out of government and leading national security policy at Anthropic. \u201cStrong export controls are essential for America's national security and AI dominance.\u201d It\u2019s not unusual for a group of scholars with a bold new vision for policy to join the government, but it\u2019s far less common for their ideas to be put swiftly into action. \u201cLook, Tarun and I argued all the time,\u201d says Estevez, but \u201cmoving in the same direction was not the issue.\u201d At least among this group of staffers, the core dispute wasn\u2019t over whether they should try to constrain China, but over how\u2014broad restrictions versus targeted measures that preserved more flexibility for industry. Finding that balance has been a moving target. After the first round of controls in October 2022, the Biden administration decided it needed to further tighten restrictions. Officials had already banned Nvidia from selling its best AI training chip to China, but the company then developed a new, China-specific chip with capabilities that pushed right up to the limits of the existing rules. In October 2023 and December 2024, the Biden administration tightened the controls on both chips and chipmaking equipment to plug what were perceived as unintentional loopholes. To make any of this stick, however, the Biden administration first needed help from Japan and the Netherlands. Keeping advanced chips out of the Chinese market was a relatively discrete task, targeting just a few products. Undermining Chinese efforts to build cutting edge chips of their own, on the other hand, was a multinational endeavor. That\u2019s because semiconductor fabrication relies on precision machinery and software from around the world, with particularly crucial inputs coming from the Dutch company ASML and Japanese companies such as Tokyo Electron. If the United States banned its equipment suppliers from selling to China, but Japan and the Netherlands kept selling, US businesses would lose revenue and China would still be able to upgrade its domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration had sought Japanese and Dutch cooperation at the outset, but there was no quick agreement. So the White House decided to go it alone and announced the 2022 controls before the allies signed on, knowing full well that the move would hurt US companies. The Biden administration then had to convince Tokyo and Amsterdam that joining the effort was worth losing some exports and risking Chinese retaliation. After decades at the Defense Department, Estevez says he was well aware that AI represented the future of warfare. Whether or not an AI inflection point was coming, he knew military planners would still prefer to face a Chinese adversary that was lagging behind technologically. This idea seemed to also carry weight with allied officials. \u201cThe sales pitch to the Dutch and the Japanese was: Artificial intelligence is the future,\u201d says Estevez. \u201cAnd they bought that.\u201d",

      "text": "When US president Joe Biden meets with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in the San Francisco Bay Area this week, the pair will have a long list of matters to discuss, including the Israel-Hamas war and Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\nBehind the scenes at the APEC summit, however, US officials hope to strike up a dialog with China about placing guardrails around military use of artificial intelligence, with the ultimate goal of lessening the potential risks that rapid adoption\u2014and reckless use\u2014of the technology might bring.\n\u201cWe have a collective interest in reducing the potential risks from the deployment of unreliable AI applications\u201d because of risks of unintended escalation, says a senior State Department official familiar with recent efforts to broach the issue and who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe very much hope to have a further conversation with China on this issue.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s meeting with Xi this week may provide momentum for more military dialog. \u201cWe're really looking forward to hopefully a positive leaders meeting,\u201d the State Department official says. \u201cWe can really understand from that conversation, where our possible bilateral arms control and non-proliferation conversation could progress.\u201d\nThe US is already leading an effort to build international agreement around guardrails for military AI. On November 1, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that 30 nations had agreed to back a declaration on military AI that calls for the technology to be developed in accordance with international humanitarian law, using principles designed to improve reliability and transparently and reduce bias, so that systems can be disengaged if they demonstrate \u201cunintended behavior.\u201d\nThe US has been lobbying other nations to join the declaration and will today launch the implementation of the declaration on military AI, which has now been signed by 45 other nations, at the United Nations.\nThe declaration \u201cadvances international norms on responsible military use of AI and autonomy, provides a basis for building common understanding, and creates a community for all states to exchange best practices,\u201d says Sasha Baker, acting under secretary of defense for policy.\nThe US, China, and the European Union have all launched initiatives aimed at shaping AI regulations. Earlier this month, representatives from many nations came together in the UK to sign a declaration warning about the risks posed by AI. At the same time, every nation with the resources is currently racing to advance AI as quickly as possible.\nThe military potential of AI has, however, emerged as a key sticking point in an increasingly tangled relationship between China and the US. Many policymakers view the technology as a crucial way for the US to gain an edge over its rival. This potential is a key reason why the US has sought to limit China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, to hamper its ability to harness the technology for military ends.\nPolicymakers who advocate for military adoption of AI also acknowledge that the technology may bring a range of new risks, including the possibility that use of AI increases mistrust between potential adversaries or that malfunctioning systems spark an escalation in hostilities.\n\u201cThere should be some room to discuss use of AI associated with lethal autonomous weapons systems,\u201d says Paul Triolo, an expert on US-China policy issues at Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategic advisory firm.\nEfforts to ban lethal autonomous weapons that target humans have so far stalled in discussions at the UN, but a new resolution, announced this month, may provide more momentum for restrictions.\nThe US and China need to agree on a definition of such weapons to start with, Triolo says. But he believes that discussions will inevitably be complicated by US sanctions, which directly target China\u2019s ability to develop advanced AI. Any talks \u201cwould necessarily, in my view, have to include a discussion of US controls on advanced computing hardware\u201d he says.\nAndrew Reddie, an associate research professor of public policy at UC Berkeley who studies emerging military technologies, says its possible the shared benefits of containing the risks of AI weapons could overcome the mistrust between the US and China. \"There is a long history of adversarial cooperation in the pursuit of risk reduction that serves the interests of both countries in an agreement,\u201d he says.\nThe US and China may use APEC to announce some sort of agreement to limit use of AI in certain military systems, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. Reddie says that any such compact would likely be symbolic and non-binding given the distance between the two sides.\nEven if lethal autonomous weapons are banned, reckless use of AI could cause military systems to fail. The rapid adoption of low-cost drones featuring autonomy by forces fighting in Ukraine has highlighted the disruptive potential of the technology, and it has prompted many militaries, including the US, to rethink their technological focus.\nThe US and Chinese militaries only recently began talking to each other again. Beijing froze military talks after Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, the democratic island nation that it views as an inalienable part of China and which also happens to be home to the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC.\nIn February, after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had crossed North America, the Pentagon said that the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, was unable to reach his Chinese counterpart via a special hotline.\nRecent incidents in the South China Sea highlight the need for communication between US and Chinese militaries. In October the US Department of Defense released video footage and images that it claimed show Chinese fighter jets engaging in unsafe maneuvers close to US aircraft in the region. This month, the Chinese defense ministry released its own footage of what it called \u201cinfringement and provocation by a US warship\u201d in the South China Sea.\nRogier Creemers, an assistant professor at Leiden University who studies Chinese technology policy, says AI systems could make such incidents more complicated\u2014or dangerous. \u201cWhat you do not want is an automated decision system that does not have the ability to keep calm and collected about these things.\u201d\nChina has, however, signaled a willingness to restart dialog. At the Xiangshan Forum in China in October, Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of China\u2019s Central Military Commission, said: \u201cWe will deepen strategic cooperation and coordination with Russia and are willing to, on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, develop military ties with the US.\u201d\nUpdated 11-13-2023, 2 pm EST: This article was updated with comment from Andrew Reddie and Rogier Creemers."

      "text": "The woman remembers the first time she got a smartphone.\nIt was 2011, and she was living in Hotan, an oasis town in Xinjiang, in northwest China. The 30-year-old, Nurjamal Atawula, loved to take pictures of her children and exchange strings of emoji with her husband while he was out. In 2013, Atawula downloaded WeChat, the Chinese social messaging app. Not long after, rumors circulated among her friends: The government could track your location through your phone. At first, she didn\u2019t believe them.\nIn early 2016, police started making routine checks on Atawula\u2019s home. Her husband was regularly called to the police station. The police informed him they were suspicious of his WeChat activity. Atawula\u2019s children began to cower in fear at the sight of a police officer.\nThe harassment and fear finally reached the point that the family decided to move to Turkey. Atawula\u2019s husband, worried that Atawula would be arrested, sent her ahead while he stayed in Xinjiang and waited for the children\u2019s passports.\n\u201cThe day I left, my husband was arrested,\u201d Atawula said. When she arrived in Turkey in June 2016, her phone stopped working\u2014and by the time she had it repaired, all her friends and relatives had deleted her from their WeChat accounts. They feared that the government would punish them for communicating with her.\nShe was alone in Istanbul and her digital connection with life in Xinjiang was over. Apart from a snatched Skype call with her mother for 11 and a half minutes at the end of December 2016, communication with her relatives has been completely cut. \u201cSometimes I feel like the days I was with my family are just my dreams, as if I have been lonely all my life\u2014ever since I was born,\u201d she said.\nAtawula now lives alone in Zeytinburnu, a working-class neighborhood in Istanbul. It\u2019s home to Turkey\u2019s largest population of Uyghurs, the mostly Muslim ethnic minority native to Xinjiang, a vast, resource-rich land of deserts and mountains along China\u2019s ancient Silk Road trade route.\nAtawula is one of around 34,000 Uyghurs in Turkey. She is unable to contact any of her relatives\u2014via phone, WeChat, or any other app. \u201cI feel very sad when I see other people video chatting with their families,\u201d she says. \u201cI think, why can\u2019t we even hear the voice of our children?\u201d\nFor Uyghurs in Xinjiang, any kind of contact from a non-Chinese phone number, though not officially illegal, can result in instant arrest. Most Uyghurs in Turkey have been deleted by their families on social media. And many wouldn\u2019t dare try to make contact, for fear Chinese authorities would punish their relatives. It\u2019s just one of the ways President Xi Jinping\u2019s government maintains a tightly controlled net of surveillance over the Uyghurs in China, and it has a ripple effect on Uyghurs living all over the world.\nZeytinburnu, the Istanbul suburb where Atawula lives, lies behind the city\u2019s winding expressways, and is dotted with restaurants and caf\u00e9s serving Uyghur cuisine: wide, slippery noodles, lamb kebabs, and green tea. The Uyghur separatist flag\u2014a light blue version of the Turkish flag\u2014is a common sight. It\u2019s a banned image in China, representing East Turkestan, the name for Xinjiang despised by the Chinese government that almost all Uyghurs here give to their homeland.\nXinjiang\u2014meaning \u201cnew frontier\u201d in Chinese\u2014was brought under the Communist Party of China\u2019s control in 1949. During the latter half of the 20th century, Uyghur independence was a threat that loomed over the party\u2019s agenda. The government tried to stamp out separatism and \u201cassimilate\u201d the Uyghurs by encouraging mass migration of Han Chinese, China\u2019s dominant ethnic group, to Xinjiang.\nDuring the \u201990s, riots erupted between Uyghurs and Chinese police. In a white paper published in March, the Chinese government defined the riots as \u201cinhuman, anti-social and barbaric acts\u201d perpetrated by separatist groups. Amnesty International, meanwhile, described the 1997 protests in Gulja, Xinjiang, as a peaceful demonstration turned massacre, quoting exiled Uyghur activist Rebiya Kadeer. \u201cI have never seen such viciousness in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese soldiers were bludgeoning the demonstrators.\u201d\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Chinese government took a page from George W. Bush\u2019s war on terror and began targeting separatist groups in Xinjiang. In 2009, bloody ethnic riots broke out between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital. Police put the city on lockdown, enforcing an internet blackout and cutting cell phone service. It was the beginning of a new policy to control the Uyghur population\u2014digitally.\nThe WeChat Lockdown\nIn recent years, China has carried out its crackdown on Islamic extremism via smartphone. In 2011, Chinese IT giant Tencent holdings launched a new app called WeChat\u2014known as \u201cUndidar\u201d in the Uyghur language. It quickly became a vital communication tool across China.\nThe launch of WeChat was \u201ca moment of huge relief and freedom,\u201d said Aziz Isa, a Uyghur scholar who has studied Uyghur use of WeChat alongside Rachel Harris at London\u2019s SOAS University. \u201cNever before in Uyghur life had we had the opportunity to use social media in this way,\u201d Isa said, describing how Uyghurs across class divides were openly discussing everything from politics to religion to music.\nBy 2013, around a million Uyghurs were using the app. Harris and Isa observed a steady rise in Islamic content, \u201cmost of it apolitical but some of it openly radical and oppositional.\u201d Isa remembers being worried by some of the more nationalist content he saw, though he believes it accounted for less than 1 percent of all the posts. Most Uyghurs, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t understand the authorities were watching.\u201d\nThis kind of unrestricted communication on WeChat went on for around a year. But in May 2014, the Chinese government enlisted a taskforce to stamp out \u201cmalpractice\u201d on instant messaging apps, in particular \u201crumors and information leading to violence, terrorism, and pornography.\u201d WeChat, alongside its rival apps, was required to let the government monitor the activity of its users.\nMiyesser Mijit, 28, whose name has been changed to protect her family, is a Uyghur master\u2019s student in Istanbul who left Xinjiang in 2014, just before the crackdown. During her undergraduate studies in mainland China, she and her Uyghur peers had already learned to use their laptops and phones with caution. They feared they would be expelled from university if they were caught expressing their religion online.\nMijit\u2019s brother, who was drafted into the Xinjiang police force in the late 2000s, warned her to watch her language while using technology. \u201cHe always told me not to share anything about my religion and to take care with my words,\u201d Mijit said. She did not take part in the widespread WeChat conversations about religion. If her friends sent her messages about Islam, she would delete them immediately, and performed a factory reset on her phone before coming home to Xinjiang for the university vacation period. Her precautions turned out to be insufficient.\nA Surveillance State Is Born\nThe monitoring of Uyghurs was not limited to their smartphones. Mijit remembers first encountering facial recognition technology in the summer of 2013. Her brother came home from the police station carrying a device slightly bigger than a cellphone. He scanned her face and entered her age range as roughly between 20 and 30. The device promptly brought up all her information, including her home address. Her brother warned her this technology would soon be rolled out across Xinjiang. \u201cAll your life will be in the record,\u201d he told her.\nIn May 2014, alongside the WeChat crackdown, China announced a wider \u201cStrike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism.\u201d It was a response to several high-profile attacks attributed to Uyghur militants, including a suicide car bombing in Tiananmen Square in 2013 and, in the spring of 2014, a train station stabbing in Kunming followed by a market bombing in Urumqi. Authorities zeroed in on ethnic Uyghurs, alongside Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang.\nAfter being subjected to daily police checks on her home in Urumqi, Mijit decided to leave Xinjiang for Turkey. When she returned to China for a vacation in 2015, she saw devices like the one her brother had shown her being used at police checkpoints every few hundred feet. Her face was scanned by police the moment she arrived at the city gates. \u201cI got off the bus and everyone was checked one by one,\u201d she said. She was also greeted by devices affixed to the entrance of every supermarket, mall, and hospital.\nAmina Abduwayit, 38, a businesswoman from Urumqi who now lives in Zeytinburnu, remembers being summoned to the police station and having her face scanned and inputted into the police database.\u201cIt was like a monkey show,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would ask you to stare like this and that. They would ask you to laugh, and you laugh, and ask you to glare and you glare.\u201d\nAbduwayit was also asked to give DNA and blood samples to the police. This was part of a larger, comprehensive campaign by the Chinese government to build a biometric picture of Xinjiang\u2019s Uyghur population and help track those deemed nonconformists. \u201cThe police station was full of Uyghurs,\u201d Abduwayit says. \u201cAll of them were there to give blood samples.\u201d\nFinally, Abduwayit was made to give a voice sample to the police. \u201cThey gave me a newspaper to read aloud for one minute. It was a story about a traffic accident, and I had to read it three times. They thought I was faking a low voice.\u201d\nThe voice-recognition program was powered by Chinese artificial intelligence giant iFlytek, which claims a 70 percent share of China\u2019s speech recognition industry. In August 2017, Human Rights Watch found information indicating iFlytek supplied voiceprint technology to police bureaus in Xinjiang province. The company opened an office in Silicon Valley in 2017 and remains open about working \u201cunder the guidance of the Ministry of Public Security\u201d to provide \u201ca new experience for public safety and forensic identification,\u201d according to the Chinese version of its website. The company says it offers a particular focus to creating antiterrorism technology.\nHuman Rights Watch believes the company has been piloting a system in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security to monitor telephone conversations. \u201cMany party and state leaders including Xi Jinping have inspected and praised the company\u2019s innovative work,\u201d iFlytek\u2019s website reads.\nHalmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uyghur activist, visited the city of Turpan in 2016 and was shocked by the psychological impact of near-constant police checks. \u201cYou feel like you are under water,\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot breathe. Every breath you take, you\u2019re careful.\u201d\nHe remembers driving out to the desert with a friend, who told him he wanted to watch the sunset. They locked their cellphones in the car and walked away. \u201cMy friend said, \u2018Tell me what\u2019s happening outside. Do foreign countries know about the Uyghur oppression?\u2019 We talked for a couple of hours. He wanted to stay there all night.\u201d\nTo transform Xinjiang into one of the most tightly controlled surveillance states in the world, a vast, gridlike security network had to be created. Over 160,000 cameras were installed in the city of Urumqi by 2016, according to China security and surveillance experts Adrian Zenz and James Leibold.\nIn the year following Chen Quanguo\u2019s 2016 appointment as regional party secretary, more than 100,000 security-related positions were advertised, while security spending leapt by 92 percent\u2014a staggering $8.6 billion increase.\nIt\u2019s part of a wider story of huge domestic security investment across China, which hit a record $197 billion in 2017. Around 173 million cameras now watch China\u2019s citizens. In the imminent future, the government has laid out plans to achieve 100 percent video coverage of \u201ckey public areas.\u201d\nFor Uyghurs, \u201cthe employment situation in Xinjiang is difficult and limited,\u201d said Zenz. A lot of the good jobs require fluency in Chinese\u2014which many Uyghurs don\u2019t have. Joining the police force is one of the only viable opportunities open to Uyghurs, who are then tasked with monitoring their own people.\nChina\u2019s Uyghur Gulags\nThe government\u2019s efforts to control the people of Xinjiang were not only digital; it also began to imprison them physically. In August 2018, a United Nations human rights panel said it believed one million Uyghurs were being held in what amounts to a \u201cmassive internment camp shrouded in secrecy.\u201d\nAt first, China denied the existence of the camps entirely. But then, in October 2018, the government announced it had launched \u201ca vocational education and training program\u201d and passed a law legitimizing what they termed \u201ctraining centers.\u201d\nIn a September 2018 report, Human Rights Watch found human rights violations in Xinjiang to be of a scope and scale not seen since the Cultural Revolution and that the creation of the camps reflected Beijing\u2019s commitment to \u201ctransforming Xinjiang in its own image.\u201d\nGulbahar Jalilova, 54, a Uyghur clothes retailer from Kazakhstan, spent one year, three months and 10 days in detention centers and camps in Urumqi. She now lives in Istanbul. According to her arrest warrant in China, issued by the Urumqi Public Security Bureau, she was detained \u201cfor her suspicious involvement in terrorist activities in the region.\u201d Police accused her of money laundering via one of her employees in Urumqi, who was also arrested. Jalilova denies the charges, saying that they were a mere pretext.\nJalilova was taken to a kanshousuo, one of the many temporary detention centers in the Xinjiang capital. Over the next 15 months, she was transferred to three different jails and camps in Urumqi. She is precise and exacting in her memory of life in detention: a 10-by-20 foot cell, with up to 50 people sitting in tightly packed rows, their feet tucked beneath them.\nJalilova, who has struggled with her memory since being released in August 2018, keeps a notebook where she has written down all the names of the women who were in the cell with her. She also notes the reasons for their arrest, which include downloading WhatsApp\u2014a blocked app in China\u2014storing the numbers of prominent Uyghur scholars, and being caught with religious content on their phones.\nShe remembers how the cell was fitted with cameras on all four sides, with a television mounted above the door. \u201cThe leaders in Beijing can see you,\u201d the guards told her. Once a month, Jalilova said, the guards would play Xi Jinping\u2019s speeches to inmates and make them write letters of remorse. \u201cIf you wrote something bad, they would punish you,\u201d Jalilova said. \u201cYou could only say \u2018Thank you to the Party\u2019 and \u2018I have cleansed myself of this or that\u2019 and \u2018I will be a different person once I am released.\u2019\u201d\nShe was set free in August 2018 and came to Turkey, no longer feeling safe in Kazakhstan, where the government has been accused of deporting Uyghurs back to Xinjiang.\nEscape to Turkey\nThough no official statistics for the camps exist, the volunteer-run Xinjiang Victims Database has gathered more than 3,000 Uyghur, Kazakh, and other Muslim minorities\u2019 testimonials for their missing relatives. It shows that around 73 percent of those recorded as being in detention are men.\nIt follows that the majority of people who have escaped Xinjiang for Turkey in recent years are women. Local activists estimate 65 percent of the Uyghur population in Turkey is female, many separated from their husbands.\nSome Uyghur women made their clandestine escape from Xinjiang by fleeing overland, through China and Thailand to Malaysia, before flying to Turkey. In Zeytinburnu, they live in a network of shared apartments, making whatever money they can by doing undocumented work in the local textile industry, as tailors or seamstresses.\nThe women who arrived without their husbands are known among other Uyghurs as \u201cthe widows.\u201d Their husbands are trapped in Xinjiang, and they do not know if they are alive, imprisoned, or dead.\nKalbinur Tursun, 35, left Xinjiang in April 2016 with her youngest son Mohamed, the only one of her children who had a passport at the time. She left her other children and husband in Xinjiang. She was pregnant with her seventh child, a daughter called Marziya whom she feared she would be forced to abort, having already had many more children than China\u2019s two-child policy allows.\nWhen Tursun first arrived in Turkey, she video-called her husband every day over WeChat. Tursun believes Chinese police arrested him on June 13, 2016\u2014as that was the last time she spoke to him. She was then told by a friend that her husband had been sentenced to 10 years in jail as a result of her decision to leave. \u201cI am so afraid my children hate me,\u201d she said.\nTurkey is seen as a safer place to go than other Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, whose leaders have both recently dismissed the Uyghurs\u2019 plight. Uyghurs have come to Turkey in waves from China since the 1950s. They are not given work permits, and many hope they will eventually find refuge in Europe or the United States.\nThough Turkey has traditionally acted as protector for Uyghurs, whom they view as Turkic kin, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has been reluctant to speak up for the Uyghurs in recent years as trade relations with China have improved. (By the same token, the Trump administration has declined to press China on human rights issues in Xinjiang as it negotiates a trade deal with Beijing.)\nOn February 9, 2019, Hami Aksoy, a spokesman for Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, broke the diplomatic hush. \u201cIt is no longer a secret that more than one million Uyghur Turks incurring arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in internment camps and prisons,\u201d Aksoy\u2019s statement read.\nHua Chunying, a spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, rebuffed these claims two days later, calling the statement \u201ca groundless accusation based on lies.\u201d She highlighted the threat of \u201cthree evil forces\u201d\u2014terrorism, extremism and separatism\u2014in China and abroad.\nAs a result of China\u2019s policy in the region, Hua said, Xinjiang residents \u201cnow have a stronger sense of security, happiness, and fulfillment\u2026 the radiant smile on the faces of local people is the most eloquent response to those rumours.\u201d\nHua also underlined the terrorist threat Turkey faces as a multi-ethnic country. \u201cIf it adopts double standards on counter-terrorism, it will only end up hurting itself as well as others,\u201d she said.\nAmina Abduwayit, the businesswoman from Urumqi, was afraid to speak freely when she arrived in Turkey in 2015. For the first two years after she arrived, she did not dare to greet another Uyghur. \u201cEven though I was far away from China, I still lived in fear of surveillance,\u201d she said. Though she now feels less afraid, she has not opened her WeChat app in a year and a half.\nOthers tried to use WeChat to contact their families, but the drip-feed of information became steadily slower. In 2016, findings by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, a research center that monitors methods of information control, showed how the app was censoring its users by tracking their keyword usage. Among the search terms that could trigger official suspicion are any words relating to Uyghur issues such as \u201c2009 Urumqi riots,\u201d \u201c2012 Kashgar riots,\u201d and anything to do with Islam.\nIn Zeytinburnu, seamstress Tursungul Yusuf, 42, remembers how phone calls and messages from relatives in Xinjiang became increasingly terse as 2017 went on. \u201cWhen we spoke, they\u2019d keep it brief. They\u2019d say, \u2018We\u2019re OK, safe.\u2019 They\u2019d speak in code\u2014if someone was jailed in the camps, they would say they\u2019d been \u2018admitted to hospital.\u2019 I\u2019d say \u2018understood.\u2019 We could not talk freely. My older daughter wrote \u2018I am helpless\u2019 on her WeChat status. She then sent me one message, \u2018Assalam,\u2019 before deleting me.\u201d\nA kind of WeChat code had developed through emoji: A half-fallen rose meant someone had been arrested. A dark moon, they had gone to the camps. A sun emoji\u2014\u201cI am alive.\u201d A flower\u2014\u201cI have been released.\u201d\nMessages were becoming more enigmatic by the day. Sometimes, a frantic series of messages parroting CPC propaganda would be followed by a blackout in communication. Washington, DC-based Uyghur activist Aydin Anwar recalls that where Uyghurs used to write \u201cinshallah\u201d on social media, they now write \u201cCPC.\u201d\nOn the few occasions she was able to speak with relatives, she said \u201cit sounded like their soul had been taken out of them.\u201d A string of pomegranate images were a common theme: the Party\u2019s symbol of ethnic cohesion, the idea that all minorities and Han Chinese people should live harmoniously alongside one another, \u201clike the seeds of a pomegranate.\u201d By late 2017, most Uyghurs in Turkey had lost contact with their families completely.\nResilience, Resistance, Resolve\nIn a book-lined apartment in Zeytinburnu, Abduweli Ayup, a Uyghur activist and poet, coaches Amina Abduwayit, the businesswoman who fled Xinjiang after police took her DNA. They\u2019re filming a video they plan to upload to Facebook. Ayup films her on his smartphone, while she sits at a table and recounts how her home city of Urumqi was a \u201cdigital prison.\u201d\nAbduwayit describes how they were afraid to turn the lights on early in the morning, for fear the police would think they were praying. She then lists all the members of her family whom she believes have been transferred to detention centers.\nAbuwayit is just one of hundreds of Uyghurs in Turkey\u2014and thousands across the world\u2014who have decided to upload their story to the internet.\nSince this time last year, a kind of digital revolution has taken place. The Finland-based Uyghur activist Halmurat Harri believes he was the first person to film a testimonial. \u201cI want freedom for my parents, freedom for Uyghur,\u201d he said in a cell phone video recorded in his bathroom in Helsinki last April, before shaving off his hair in protest. \u201cThen I called people and asked them to make their own testimony videos,\u201d Harri said.\nVideos filmed on smartphones from Uyghur kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms began appearing on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. Ayup described how at the beginning, people would \u201ccover their faces and were afraid of their voices being recognized,\u201d but as 2018 progressed, people became braver.\nGene Bunin, a scholar based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, manages the volunteer-run Xinjiang Victims Database, and has cataloged and gathered thousands of testimonials from Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minorities targeted in Xinjiang.\nBunin noticed that unlike private attempts to make contact, public exposure of missing relatives seemed to push the Chinese authorities to respond. This is particularly true for cases where victims had links to Kazakhstan, where the government has been exerting pressure on China to release ethnic Kazakhs. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence the Chinese government is willing to make concessions for those whose relatives give video testimonies,\u201d Bunin said.\nHe was told of people being released as little as 24 hours after their relatives posted testimonies online. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong sign the Xinjiang authorities are reacting to these videos,\u201d he said.\nChina has recently stepped up its defense of practices in Xinjiang, seemingly in response to broader Western attention. In March, Reuters reported that China would invite European diplomats to visit the region. That followed a statement by Xinjiang governor Shohrat Zakir that the camps were in fact \u201cboarding schools.\u201d\nHarri recently started a hashtag, #MeTooUyghur, encouraging Uyghurs around the world to demand evidence that their families were alive.\nLarge WhatsApp news groups, with members from the international Uyghur diaspora, have also been a vital source of solidarity for a community deprived of information.\nOn December 24, 2018, Kalbinur Tursun\u2014the woman who left five of her children in Xinjiang\u2014was sitting in the ladies\u2019 clothing shop she manages in Zeytinburnu, scrolling through a Uyghur WhatsApp group. She checks it first thing in the morning, last thing at night, and dozens of times throughout the day, as several hundred Uyghur members post near-constant videos and updates on the crisis in Xinjiang.\nShe tapped on a video of a room full of Uyghur children, playing a game. An off-camera voice shouts \u201cBizi! Bizi! Bizi!\u201d\u2014Chinese for \u201cNose! Nose! Nose!\u201d and an excited group of children tap their noses. Tursun was astonished.\nOn the left, she recognized her 6-year-old daughter, Aisha. \u201cHer emotion, her laugh \u2026 it\u2019s her. It\u2019s like a miracle,\u201d she said. \u201cI see my child so much in my dreams, I never imagined I would see her in real life.\u201d It had been two years since she had last heard her daughter\u2019s voice.\nThe video appears to come from one of the so-called \u201cLittle Angel Schools\u201d in Hotan province, around 300 miles from Tursun\u2019s native Kashgar, where it\u2019s been reported nearly 3,000 Uyghur children are held. Tursun wonders whether her four other children may have been taken even further afield. Speaking to Radio Free Asia, a Communist Party official for the province said the orphanages were patrolled by police to \u201cprovide security.\u201d\nUnlike almost everyone in the global Uyghur diaspora, Nurjamal Atawula managed to find a way to contact her family after the WeChat blackout. She used one of the oldest means possible: writing a letter. In late 2016, she heard of a woman in Zeytinburnu who regularly traveled back and forth between Turkey and her parents\u2019 village in Xinjiang. She asked the woman to take a letter to her family. The woman agreed. Atawula wrote to her brother and was careful not to include anything border inspection or police might be able to use against him.\n\u201cWhen I was writing the letter, I felt I was living in the dark ages,\u201d Atawula said. She gave it to the woman, along with small presents for her children and money she had saved for her family.\nA month later, she got a reply. The Uyghur woman, who she calls sister, smuggled a letter from her brother out of China, hidden in a packet of tissues.\nAtawula sent a reply with her go-between\u2014but after the third trip, the woman disappeared. Atawula doesn\u2019t know what happened to her. She still writes to her family, but her letters are now kept in a diary, in the hope that one day her children will be able to read them.\nIt has now been more than two years since Atawula received her brother\u2019s letter. She keeps it carefully folded, still in the tissue it came in. In that time, she has only read the words three times, as if by looking at them too much they will lose their power.\nMy beautiful sister,\nHow are you? After you left Urumqi we couldn\u2019t contact you, but when we got your letter we were so pleased. I have so many words for you\u2026 maybe after we reunite we will be able to say them to one another. You said you miss your children. May Allah give you patience. Mother, me, and the relatives all miss you very much. We have so many hopes for you. Please be strong and don\u2019t worry about the children.\nThis article is a co-production with Coda's Authoritarian Tech channel."

      "text": "The Biden administration is expected to announce a sweeping set of measures on Monday designed to further restrain China\u2019s ability to develop advanced artificial intelligence, people familiar with the matter told WIRED. The controls could include sanctioning dozens of Chinese companies that produce equipment for making semiconductors, as well as placing restrictions on a handful of chip manufacturing plants, some of which have ties to the Chinese tech giant Huawei.\nThe US Department of Commerce has also discussed including controls on the sale of high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, an advanced kind of 3D-stacked computer memory component that is often used in high-performance GPUs and customized AI chips. Bloomberg previously reported that the Biden administration was considering clamping down on China\u2019s access to HBM chips.\nIn total, the Biden administration could end up adding around 200 Chinese firms to an entity list maintained by the Bureau of Industry and Security\u2014an agency within the Commerce department\u2014which would require other companies to acquire special licenses to supply them with software or products from the United States. The US government has been discussing the new measures with its allies and representatives from the semiconductor industry for months, and the exact details of what will be announced on Monday were still in flux as of earlier this week.\nA spokesperson for the Commerce department declined to comment. Huawei did not immediately return a request for comment.\nReuters reported on Friday that the US Chamber of Commerce, a powerful advocacy group for American businesses, warned its members in an email last week that a new round of export controls targeting China would be arriving \u201cprior to the Thanksgiving break,\" though that timing now appears to have been pushed back by a few days.\n\u201cChina is firmly opposed to the US overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control measures and making malicious attempts to block and suppress China,\u201d Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a regularly scheduled press conference earlier this week in response to the anticipated controls.\nThe limits on China\u2019s access to the high-bandwidth memory seem aimed at slowing the country\u2019s efforts to develop domestic chips capable of training very large and powerful AI models. The new restrictions are expected to block access to HMB3, one of the people told WIRED, the latest and most advanced version of the technology, and impose some limits on access to the previous generation, known as HMB2.\nThe US government has been imposing similar export controls on China aimed at limiting its ability to mint advanced silicon for years, but the controls apparently didn\u2019t stop Huawei from developing competitive chips for training large AI models.\nThe Chinese tech giant, which was temporarily crippled by US sanctions half a decade ago, sent samples of its latest AI training chip, called Ascend, to customers this September, according to the South China Morning Post. Companies testing Ascend reportedly include ByteDance, the Chinese parent of TikTok, which is said to be training a large model primarily using Ascend. Baidu, which makes China\u2019s leading search engine and has developed autonomous driving systems, recently placed an order for Huawei\u2019s chips in a shift away from US chip giant Nvidia, according to Reuters. (Nvidia declined to comment.)\nExport restrictions aimed at curbing China\u2019s AI sector began under the first Trump administration. In 2019, several up-and-coming Chinese AI firms were added to the entity list, meaning that US firms, including chipmakers like Nvidia, would be required to get a special license to do business with them. This was followed by restrictions on sales of chips made with US technology to Huawei, China\u2019s dominant telco and a leading smartphone manufacturer.\nThe Biden administration ratcheted up the controls in October 2022, limiting exports to China of cutting-edge GPU chips, including those made by Nvidia, a move aimed at curbing any Chinese company\u2019s ability to train the most powerful AI models. The rules were tightened a year later to close loopholes that still allowed Chinese firms to access some advanced chips.\nIt can be tricky to gauge the impact of US chip sanctions, and some experts question whether the controls are spurring China to make more rapid advances in chipmaking itself, reducing its reliance on American companies.\nIn late 2023, Huawei unveiled the Mate 60, a smartphone featuring an advanced chip from the Chinese chipmaker SMIC. The announcement caused a stir in Washington, because it suggested that SMIC had made substantial progress in advancing its own manufacturing techniques. (Further analysis indicated that Huawei and SMIC were still reliant on foreign suppliers.)\nBut a report published this week by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based think tank, argued that the Chinese government had already begun ramping up investment in domestic chipmaking before the US government began clamping down on the country\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors. It also noted that China has made bigger strides in sectors not subject to export controls, such as solar cell and electric vehicle manufacturing."

      "text": "In 2015, car-and-rocket man Elon Musk joined with influential startup backer Sam Altman to put artificial intelligence on a new, more open course. They cofounded a research institute called OpenAI to make new AI discoveries and give them away for the common good. Now, the institute\u2019s researchers are sufficiently worried by something they built that they won\u2019t release it to the public.\nThe AI system that gave its creators pause was designed to learn the patterns of language. It does that very well\u2014scoring better on some reading-comprehension tests than any other automated system. But when OpenAI\u2019s researchers configured the system to generate text, they began to think about their achievement differently.\n\u201cIt looks pretty darn real,\u201d says David Luan, vice president of engineering at OpenAI, of the text the system generates. He and his fellow researchers began to imagine how it might be used for unfriendly purposes. \u201cIt could be that someone who has malicious intent would be able to generate high-quality fake news,\u201d Luan says.\nThat concern prompted OpenAI to publish a research paper on its results, but not release the full model or the 8 million web pages it used to train the system. Previously, the institute has often disseminated full code with its publications, including an earlier version of the language project from last summer.\nOpenAI\u2019s hesitation comes amid growing concern about the ethical implications of progress in AI, including from tech companies and lawmakers.\nGoogle, too, has decided that it\u2019s no longer appropriate to innocently publish new AI research findings and code. Last month, the search company disclosed in a policy paper on AI that it has put constraints on research software it has shared because of fears of misuse. The company recently joined Microsoft in adding language to its financial filings warning investors that its AI software could raise ethical concerns and harm the business.\nOpenAI let WIRED play with its text generator, via a web page that lets you type in text the system uses like a writing prompt. The results could be garbled, but the way the system riffed on prompts such as song lyrics, poems, and phrases like \u201chere is a recipe for yogurt pancakes\u201d confirmed Luan\u2019s view that the output can look pretty darn real.\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take much to get the system to unspool paragraphs that resembled the work of disinformation artists. When WIRED typed in the phrase \u201cHillary Clinton and George Soros,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s system wrote the following:\nJack Clark, policy director at OpenAI, says that example shows how technology like this might shake up the processes behind online disinformation or trolling, some of which already use some form of automation. \u201cAs costs of producing text fall, we may see behaviors of bad actors alter,\u201d he says.\nThe sample reflects the nature of text on the internet and how machine-learning systems try to mimic what\u2019s in their training data. \u201cThis stuff reads great, but it\u2019s not necessarily true,\u201d says Kristian Hammond, a professor at Northwestern. \u201cIt\u2019s learning the surface structure\u2014Given what I know, what words can I say that sound right?\u201d OpenAI\u2019s researchers have seen their system write text with nonsensical scenarios, like fires underwater.\nHammond cofounded a startup called Narrative Science that generates business documents like financial reports by translating data into text. He says OpenAI\u2019s system shows impressive fluency and could be useful in creative projects. OpenAI's research builds on a recent spurt of progress on software that processes text, enabled by new machine-learning systems better at searching through text for contextual clues to a word\u2019s meaning.\nIn order for machines that write to be broadly useful, however, they probably need to be able to reliably stick to the facts or be grounded in some kind of external data. \u201cI hope we can now find ways to hook in real data about the world, the truth, into this kind of system,\u201d Hammond says.\nIf your work is posting falsehoods on the internet, the truth doesn\u2019t much matter. Such projects might find uses for text generation like OpenAI\u2019s sooner than financial firms like those working with Narrative Science.\nA version of OpenAI\u2019s text generator trained on Amazon product reviews illustrates how a little extra training can adapt it to a specific task\u2014or attack. Fake reviews trying to boost or drag down products or businesses are already a headache for companies such as Yelp, and they have been weaponized in political disputes.\nPrompted to write a 1-star book review with the summary \u201cI hate Tom Simonite\u2019s book,\u201d the model wrote:\nOpenAI\u2019s concerns about the downsides of AI-generated text echo worries that misleading \u201cdeepfake\u201d videoclips made with machine learning could undermine elections or spread false information. Clark of OpenAI likens the lab\u2019s text-generation system to the state of the image-generating technology at the heart of deepfakes in 2015, when no one much worried about fake imagery.\nThe technology matured fast, and it became easy to access after an anonymous coder released tools he or she had developed to insert Hollywood stars into pornographic videos. The Pentagon is now devoting millions of dollars to figure out how to detect AI-altered imagery, and last month a Republican senator introduced a bill seeking to criminalize the creation and dissemination of deepfakes.\nClark says OpenAI hopes that by voicing its concerns about its own code, it can encourage AI researchers to be more open and thoughtful about what they develop and release. \u201cWe\u2019re not sounding the alarm. What we\u2019re saying is, if we have two or three more years of progress,\u201d such concerns will be even more pressing, Clark says.\nThat timeline is necessarily fuzzy. Although machine-learning software that deals with language has been improving rapidly, no one knows for sure how long, or how far, it will go. \u201cIt could be an S-curve and we\u2019re about to saturate, or it could be that we\u2019ll keep accelerating,\u201d says Alec Radford, a researcher who worked on OpenAI\u2019s project.\n- Journalism isn't dying.

      "text": "As the trade war between China and the United States continues to escalate, Beijing is responding by turning to one of its favorite retaliation tactics: limiting the export of critical minerals used in many high-tech electronics, from fighter jets to wind turbines. While China\u2019s mineral restrictions may sound scary, the reality is that they haven\u2019t been very effective in the past and stand to become even less so if the US and other countries finally get their acts together.\nIt all started in July 2023, when the Chinese government announced it would restrict the export of gallium and germanium, two critical minerals that are mostly used in making solar panels and semiconductors. Over the following two years, China\u2019s list of controlled products expanded to include antimony, graphite, and other materials. Earlier this month, the Chinese government escalated things even further, subjecting seven rare earth elements to a more comprehensive export licensing program that covers the whole world and is designed to further choke off American companies.\nRare earths are a subset of elements under the broader umbrella of critical minerals that China has long enjoyed monopoly control over. In the short term, companies that need these rare earths might be able to rely on existing stockpiles or even turn to recycled electronics to find them. But eventually, the US and other countries will be forced to either ramp up domestic mining or reduce their dependence on rare earths, both of which would make China\u2019s policies sting less. \u201cChina has got one shot, and it knows it,\u201d says Ian Lange, an associate professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines.\nRare but Not Irreplaceable\nThe export controls China announced earlier this month cover samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium\u2014seven elements that belong to what is known as the rare earth family. They are called \u201crare\u201d not because of their scarcity but because they often are mixed with other mineral resources and can be hard to separate out.\nThere are 17 rare earth elements in total, but the Chinese government chose these seven because they are part of a smaller subset of \u201cheavy\u201d rare earth minerals that the country has more control over than others, says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. That monopoly was built over decades as China created a robust supply chain for these minerals and the rest of the world turned away from what is a heavily polluting and niche sector. \u201cChina processes pretty much 100 percent of the world\u2019s heavy rare earths, which means that they don\u2019t just have a comparative advantage, they have an absolute advantage,\u201d says Baskaran.\nBut the other important thing to know about rare earths is that\u2014while they are used in a wide variety of products\u2014those items typically only contain very small quantities, and often only in supportive roles. Last year, the United States imported about $170 million worth of rare earth elements, including some that China hasn\u2019t restricted yet, according to the United States Geological Survey. For comparison, the US imported over $327 million worth of fresh potatoes and $300 million worth of potato chips between September 2023 and August 2024.\nPerhaps the most important application for rare earth elements is creating magnets that improve the performance of products like electric motors in high temperatures. These magnets can be found in electric vehicles and consumer products like vacuum cleaners.\n\u201cThe heavy rare earth elements are added as sort of a spice, a doping agent, to maintain the magnetism of the magnet at high temperatures. It also improves corrosion resistance and the longevity of the magnet,\u201d says Seaver Wang, director of the climate and energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland-based think tank.\nBeyond magnets, these rare earth elements can also serve a range of purposes, such as making metal stronger, improving radar systems, and even treating cancer. Without them, in many cases, technological infrastructure and consumer gadgets won\u2019t be able to perform at the same level\u2014but they will still maintain their basic functions. \u201cThe wind turbines will just go out of service 10 years earlier; electric vehicles will not last as long,\u201d says Wang.\nLange agrees that the impact of losing access to heavy rare earth elements would be somewhat manageable for American companies. \u201cOne place where that rare earth is in your car is in the motors that pull up and down your window,\u201d says Lange. \u201cThere are ways to just deal with some things that are not as fun, like rolling down your windows by hand.\u201d\nLoopholes and Workarounds\nIn the past, China\u2019s critical mineral restrictions haven\u2019t worked very well. One reason is that US companies that want to buy rare earth minerals can simply go through an intermediary country first. For example, Belgium has emerged as a possible re-export hub that appears to pass germanium\u2014one of the minerals Beijing first restricted in 2023\u2014from China to the US, according to trade data. Since the European Union has much closer ties with Washington than with Beijing, it\u2019s difficult for the Chinese government to effectively stop this flow of trade.\nAnother sign that China\u2019s export controls haven\u2019t been very effective is that the price of critical minerals has increased only slightly since the policies were first implemented, indicating that supply levels have remained steady. \u201cWhatever they did in 2023 hasn\u2019t really changed the status quo\u201d of the market, says Lange.\nBut China\u2019s latest restrictions are more expansive, and there\u2019s already some evidence that things could be different this time. Companies that need these elements have been forced to buy them from other firms with existing private stockpiles, which have become more valuable in recent weeks. \u201cThere is a very steep increase in prices to draw down on stockpiles right now,\u201d says Baskaran, citing conversations she\u2019s had with rare earth traders.\nIn the long run, however, companies may be able to find technological solutions to address a potential shortage of rare earth minerals. Tesla, for example, announced in 2023 that it had reduced the use of them in its EV motors by 25 percent, and it planned to get rid of them completely in the future. The carmaker hasn\u2019t clarified what it would use instead, but experts speculate it could be turning to other types of magnets that don\u2019t rely on rare earths.\nWhere Are the American Mines?\nWhile rare earths, or critical minerals in general, are often cited along with semiconductors as industries the US wants to reshore the most, the challenges associated with bringing each of them back are very different.\nUnlike making advanced semiconductors, which requires using sophisticated machinery worth hundreds of millions of dollars and building extremely complicated factories, critical minerals aren\u2019t that hard to produce. The technologies involved to mine and refine them are mature and both the US and Canada have large natural deposits of some of them. But the mining industry was pushed out of the West because it doesn\u2019t generate much value and is also extremely polluting.\nIn the past, efforts to build up the critical minerals supply chain in the US have either been slowed down or called off. That\u2019s more due to basic economic calculations, says Lange, rather than technological difficulties. \u201cIt\u2019s like bending down to pick up a nickel,\u201d he says, meaning the effort isn\u2019t worth the reward.\nBecause companies only need tiny quantities of these minerals, the market for them is very volatile\u2014prices can drop when a single new factory comes online and starts mass producing and refining them. That means if a mining company were to open up shop in the US, it could inadvertently tank the price of the same mineral it\u2019s trying to profit from, says Lange.\nBut if China succeeds in strictly enforcing its export control policies, it might provide just enough incentive for the US government and private companies to finally reshore the mineral refining industry. If that happens, Lange says, it could take about two years for a new critical mineral operation to open in the US.\n\u201cIt's really remarkable how China has actually maintained these monopolies in so many critical minerals for 20 years,\u201d says Wang. \u201cBut I do think we are maybe starting to turn the corner, where China's market share may be peaking \u2026 and you are starting to see a resurgence of interest in these industries in Northern Europe, Australia, Canada, the US, and Latin America.\u201d"

      "text": "Technology\nChips\nLast month, the Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba revealed a powerful new cloud computing system designed for artificial intelligence projects. It is used by Alibaba\u2019s cloud customers to train algorithms for tasks like chatbot dialogue and video analysis, and was built using hundreds of chips from US companies Intel and Nvidia.\nLast week, the US announced new export restrictions that will make future projects like that unlikely. The Biden administration\u2019s rules forbid companies from exporting advanced chips needed to train or run the most powerful AI algorithms to China.\nThe sweeping new controls are designed to keep the country\u2019s AI industry stuck in the dark ages while the US and other Western countries advance. The restrictions also block the export of chipmaking equipment and design software, and ban the world\u2019s leading silicon fabs, including Taiwan\u2019s TSMC and South Korea\u2019s Samsung, from manufacturing advanced chips for Chinese companies.\n\u201cThe United States is saying to China, \u2018AI technology is the future; we and our allies are going there\u2014and you can\u2019t come,\u2019\u201d says Gregory Allen, director of the AI governance project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), a think tank in Washington, DC.\nChris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and author of the recent book Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, says the new export blockade is unlike anything seen since the Cold War. \u201cThe logic is throwing sand in the gears,\u201d Miller says.\nThe US action takes advantage of a decade-long boom in artificial intelligence in which new breakthroughs have become coupled to advances in computing power. Pioneering new projects often involve machine learning algorithms trained on supercomputers with hundreds or thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs), chips originally designed for gaming but also ideal for running the necessary mathematical operations. That leaves China\u2019s AI ambitions heavily dependent on US silicon.\nBaidu, the leading Chinese web search provider and a key player in cloud AI services and autonomous driving, also uses Nvidia chips extensively in its data centers. Last October the company announced one of the world\u2019s largest AI models for generating language, built using Nvidia hardware.\nByteDance, the Chinese company behind TikTok and its counterpart in China, Douyin, relies on Nvidia hardware to train its recommendation algorithms, according to its own software documentation. Several Chinese companies, including Alibaba and Baidu, are developing silicon chips designed to compete with those from Nvidia and AMD, but these all require manufacturing from outside China that is now off-limits. Alibaba and Baidu both declined to comment on the new rules. WIRED did not receive responses to requests for comment made to ByteDance and several other Chinese chip firms.\nBig Tech companies in China\u2014as in the US\u2014have made large AI models increasingly central to applications including web search, product recommendation, translating and parsing language, image and video recognition, and autonomous driving. The same AI advances are expected to transform military technology in the years to come, and shape how the US and China butt heads over issues like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan\u2019s claims to independence.\n\u201cThe Biden administration believes that the hype around the transformative potential of AI in military applications is real,\u201d says Allen of CSIS. \u201cThe United States also has a pretty good understanding of which computer chips are going into Chinese military AI systems, and they are American, which is viewed as unacceptable.\u201d\nThe new export restrictions contribute to the steady decline in US-China relations in recent years, despite decades of technological codependence during which Chinese manufacturing has become the bedrock of the US tech industry. In recent years, the US government has sought to take a more active role in boosting its domestic AI industry and chip production due to an increased sense of competition with China.\nShares in several Chinese tech firms, as well as Nvidia and AMD, fell this week as the scope of the restrictions sank in with investors. The Department of Commerce had warned Nvidia and AMD last month that they would have to halt exports of advanced AI chips to China, but the rules announced last week are far broader. The new export rules add to a bruising 18 months for China\u2019s tech firms, after a broad government crackdown aimed at regulating the industry more tightly after years of freewheeling growth.\nBeing cut off from US chips could significantly slow Chinese AI projects. China\u2019s leading domestic chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), produces chips that lag several generations behind those of TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.\nSMIC is currently manufacturing chips in what the industry calls the 14-nanometer generation of chip making processes, a reference to how densely components can be packed onto a chip. TSMC and Samsung, meanwhile, have moved to more advanced 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer processes. SMIC recently claimed that it can produce 7-nanometer chips, albeit at low volume.\nThe capacity of any Chinese company to keep pace with advances in chip manufacturing is limited by its lack of access to the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to make chips with components smaller than those of the 7-nanometer generation. The sole manufacturer, ASML in the Netherlands, has blocked exports to China at the request of the US government.\nDavid Kanter, president at chip analysts Real World Insights, says that one from the 5-nanometer generation of semiconductor technology is roughly three times faster or more efficient than a 14-nanometer one because of a greater density of transistors and other design improvements.\nThe move will not cut China\u2019s AI industry off overnight, however. A person at a Chinese venture capital fund that specializes in AI, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitive nature of the topic, says that some Chinese companies have been stockpiling GPU components since parts of the rule change were disclosed in September. It may also be possible for companies to train AI models outside of China using equipment installed elsewhere.\nThe CEO of a Chinese AI startup, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new restrictions would slow down AI advances at Chinese companies in the long run, but predicted that they could keep up with the US in the short term by running older hardware for longer, making AI models that can do more with the same computing power, or gathering more data. \u201cIf the target is to achieve certain accuracy, the amount of data can be more helpful than computational power,\u201d the CEO says. \u201cFor most AI tasks, training AI models does not always need huge power.\u201d\nThe most important question now is how the rules are enforced, says Douglas Fuller, an associate professor at Copenhagen Business School who studies China\u2019s tech industry. \u201cIn the short term, I think this will do what it intends to do\u2014kneecap the high performance computing efforts of China,\u201d he says. But Fuller says China will look to other countries that have chipmaking expertise and may try to smuggle components in.\nUpdated 10-12-2022, 3.23 pm EDT: This article was updated to correct David Kanter's affiliation."

      "text": "Remarks by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the Special Competitive Studies Project Global Emerging Technologies Summit\nAs prepared for delivery\nCongratulations to the entire SCSP team on the release of your report.\nA little over a year ago, at the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, I had the opportunity to share a few thoughts on the digital revolution.\nI argued that after the liberalizing wave of innovations of the early internet era and after the authoritarian counter-revolution of the 2000s, when our competitors and adversaries took advantage of our complacency and inherent openness we must usher in a \u201cthird wave\u201d of the digital revolution\u2014to ensure that emerging technologies work for, not against, our democracies and security.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you that advancements in science and technology are poised to define the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century.\nThey will generate game-changers in health and medicine, food security, and clean energy.\nWe\u2019ll see leap-ahead breakthroughs and new industries that drive our prosperity.\nAnd, of course, new military and intelligence capabilities that will shape our national security.\nPreserving our edge in science and technology is not a \u201cdomestic issue\u201d or \u201cnational security\u201d issue. It\u2019s both.\nUnder President Biden\u2019s leadership, we have built into the foundation of our approach a deep integration of domestic policy and foreign policy and a focus on issues that spill out of these two traditional siloes.\nAs part of that, we are pursuing a modern industrial and innovation strategy to invest in our sources of strength at home, which also powers our strength around the world.\nWe know there is nothing inevitable about maintaining our core strength and comparative advantage in the world. It must be renewed, revitalized, and stewarded. And that is especially true for U.S. technological leadership.\nIn line with the vision I laid out last year, we see four pillars at the heart of our strategy:\nFirst, investing in our science and technology ecosystem;\nSecond, nurturing top STEM talent;\nThird, protecting our technology advantages;\nAnd fourth, deepening and integrating our alliances and partnerships.\nFundamentally, we believe that a select few technologies are set to play an outsized importance over the coming decade. Much like the Pareto Principle, we can imagine that eighty percent of our overall success will turn on what we do in twenty percent of the technologies.\nWe basically believe three families of technologies will be of particular importance over the coming decade:\n- Computing-related technologies, including microelectronics, quantum information systems, and artificial intelligence.\nAdvancements in computing hardware, algorithmic design, and large-scale datasets are leading to new discoveries in virtually every scientific field. They are new sources of economic growth. They are also driving advanced military modernization efforts.\n- Biotechnologies and biomanufacturing.\nWe now can read, write, and edit genetic code, which has rendered biology programmable. Together with advances in computing, we are poised for breakthroughs in everything from drug discovery to chemical and material manufacturing.\n- And finally, clean energy technologies.\nThe global transition to clean energy is not only necessary for the health of our planet, but it will also be a major source of economic and jobs growth in the coming years. And it will ensure long-term U.S. energy independence and energy security.\nThat is not to say that other technologies initiatives are inconsequential \u2013 far from it.\nIn fact, as an example, just this morning, the Administration released important recommendations for action to preserve U.S. leadership on digital assets.\nBut computing-related technologies, biotech, and clean tech are truly \u201cforce multipliers\u201d throughout the tech ecosystem. And leadership in each of these is a national security imperative.\nThis brings me to the first pillar of our technology strategy: recharging the engine of American technological dynamism and innovation, especially in these foundational sectors.\nOver the last year, the Biden Administration has made historic investments, and not just in basic research. We are investing in industries of the future and strengthening the resilience and security of the supply chains that underpin them.\nOver the past month alone, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, an Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation, and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe CHIPS Act invests $52 billion to restore U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and R&D and reduce our overreliance on foreign-produced chips.\nIt is an investment larger than the real cost of the Manhattan Project. On top of this, it also authorizes the largest single-year percentage increase in overall federal funding of basic scientific research in seventy years.\nAnd now we just need Congress to appropriate that funding.\nThe EO on Biotech and Biomanufacturing ensures that we not only design the next generation of medicines, materials, and fuels here, but also make them here. From lab to fab, as they say.\nAnd the Inflation Reduction Act hardly needs me to elaborate on its impact. It is the single largest investment in climate and clean energy solutions in American history.\nWith each of these investments, our goal is to \u201ccrowd in\u201d private capital, not replace it, and to attract \u201cpatient capital\u201d to bring critical technologies to scale. Particularly for next-generation energy technologies such as clean hydrogen and fusion, a proactive investment strategy now may save us billions of dollars later.\nWe are also charting the way for large-scale technological infrastructure projects that will serve as national assets, like a potential National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, which would make advanced AI and computing infrastructure available to any researcher in the United States.\nThe second pillar is developing, attracting, and retaining top talent.\nThe easiest way we can achieve this goal is ensuring the United States remains the preferred destination for all premier STEM talent around the globe.\nThis means investing in our domestic research and education pipelines, and also ensuring top foreign talent can come and stay in the United States. China is doubling down on its STEM talent production, but attracting and retaining the world\u2019s best STEM talent is an advantage that\u2019s ours to lose.\nWe have made some important progress on this front. Early this year, we announced a series of measures to streamline the immigration process and open new pathways for international STEM students and researchers.\nWe also issued new guidance eliminating the need to have a sponsoring U.S. employer for highly accomplished individuals with an advanced degree in a STEM field that is critical to U.S. national security. Such individuals can now apply for a National Interest Waiver, and self-petition for an EB-2 visa.\nThis is good. But we need to do more. We are ready to work with industry and with Congress on a bipartisan basis to capitalize on what is truly America\u2019s superpower.\nThe third pillar is protecting our technology advantages, and preventing our competitors from stealing America\u2019s intellectual property, and using our technologies against us or their own people.\nOur competitors are using increasingly sophisticated means to illicitly acquire sensitive technologies, information, and know-how, and we must adapt accordingly.\nOn export controls, we have to revisit the longstanding premise of maintaining \u201crelative\u201d advantages over competitors in certain key technologies. We previously maintained a \u201csliding scale\u201d approach that said we need to stay only a couple of generations ahead.\nThat is not the strategic environment we are in today.\nGiven the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.\nEarlier this year, the United States and our allies and partners levied on Russia the most stringent technology restrictions ever imposed on a major economy. These measures have inflicted tremendous costs, forcing Russia to use chips from dishwashers in its military equipment.\nThis has demonstrated that technology export controls can be more than just a preventative tool. If implemented in a way that is robust, durable, and comprehensive, they can be a new strategic asset in the U.S. and allied toolkit to impose costs on adversaries, and even over time degrade their battlefield capabilities.\nThe Administration also has taken a series of steps to modernize our investment screening systems. Just yesterday, President Biden issued an Executive Order providing the first formal Presidential guidance to CFIUS in the history of the Committee.\nThe order puts us back ahead of the game. It bolsters CFIUS\u2019 ability to defend against evolving risks by directing the Committee to consider, in connection with countries of concern, a new set of specific risk factors, such as whether a transaction impacts U.S. leadership in technologies relevant to national security, or presents risks to U.S. persons\u2019 data.\nWe will continue to examine whether additional steps are necessary to best posture CFIUS to protect U.S. investors from predatory foreign investments.\nLooking forward, we are making progress in formulating an approach to address outbound investments in sensitive technologies, particularly investments that would not be captured by export controls and could enhance the technological capabilities of our competitors in the most sensitive areas.\nAnd we worked closely with Congress to ensure the CHIPS Act contains robust guardrails that prevent companies that receive taxpayer money from turning around and making investments in China that undermine our national security.\nIn all cases, we fully intend for industry to have an opportunity to provide input at the right time and intend to proceed in a way that is clear for stakeholders and tailored to our national security concerns.\nProtecting our tech innovation from theft or abuse also requires strong cybersecurity protections. Through President Biden\u2019s Executive Order on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity last year, and subsequent directives, we have taken a wide range of steps necessary to defend our nation from one of the most pressing threats to our economic and national security.\nFinally, we have instituted measures to ensure the intellectual property behind our most innovative technologies is protected. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has a new pilot program that accelerates patent applications for innovations that reduce emissions, so these products can be deployed rapidly without risking their intellectual property.\nThe fourth and final pillar is deepening our cooperation with allies and partners, a true hallmark of the Biden Administration.\nFrom transforming the G7 into a steering committee of the free world on issues like sanctions and energy security to launching an innovative and far-reaching security partnership on advanced capabilities called AUKUS we are deepening our unrivaled network of alliances and partnerships and driving a strategic alignment across the Atlantic and the Pacific.\nWe created the U.S.-E.U. Trade and Technology Council to help shape the rules of the road on emerging technology, including through technical standards bodies.\nWe have established new initiatives on clean energy and on critical and emerging technologies within the Quad.\nIn the G7, we have launched new efforts on cyber and quantum, and are prepared to deploy tens of billions of dollars for tech infrastructure development through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.\nJust last week we hosted the first in-person Ministerial meeting of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which includes dedicated efforts on clean energy and digital cooperation.\nWe have started new senior-level bilateral initiatives on technology cooperation with Israel, India, Korea, and Japan.\nWe announced technology initiatives at the Summit for Democracy, which included efforts to align international export control regulations with human rights objectives, and to promote democracy-affirming and privacy-enhancing technologies.\nOn 5G, we are working with allies and partners in fora such as the Quad and the U.S.-E.U. Trade and technology council to develop trusted telecommunications infrastructure, to include Open-RAN solutions that are secure, effective, and promote existing U.S. and allied technological advantages.\nWe have scaled-up our efforts with allies and partners to share actionable cyber threat information and to hold bad cyber actors accountable for their malicious conduct.\nThese are all points on the board. But we are also connecting the dots, linking all of our efforts with like-minded economies into an integrated strategy built on the premise that we are stronger when we leverage the capabilities and common purpose of friends and allies.\nAlmost two years into the Biden Administration, we have reinforced the foundations on which American power and influence sit.\nLast year, I noted the enormity of the task we faced in redesigning the field on which future technology competition would play out.\nAnd we are facing a competitor that is determined to overtake U.S. technological leadership and willing to devote nearly limitless resources to that goal.\nBut the last 20 months \u2013 indeed just the last several weeks \u2013 have shown how powerfully and effectively we are leading.\nWe have made historically unprecedented investments, putting us back on track to lead in the industries of the future.\nWe are doubling down on our efforts to be a magnet for the world\u2019s top technical talent.\nWe have adapted our technology protection tools to new geopolitical realities.\nAnd most importantly, we have done this in a way that is inclusive, force-multiplying, and consistent with our values.\nAt home, many of our efforts have been bipartisan. And overseas, many of them have been in lockstep with our allies and partners.\nThe work ahead of us remains significant. But taking stock of where we are today, it\u2019s clear that America is rising to the moment. Thank you very much.\nEND"

      "text": "Jason Matheny is a delight to speak with, provided you\u2019re up for a lengthy conversation about potential technological and biomedical catastrophe.\nNow CEO and president of Rand Corporation, Matheny has built a career out of thinking about such gloomy scenarios. An economist by training with a focus on public health, he dived into the worlds of pharmaceutical development and cultivated meat before turning his attention to national security.\nAs director of Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the US intelligence community's research agency, he pushed for more attention to the dangers of biological weapons and badly designed artificial intelligence. In 2021, Matheny was tapped to be President Biden\u2019s senior adviser on technology and national security issues. And then, in July of last year, he became CEO and president of Rand, the oldest nonprofit think tank in the US, which has shaped government policy on nuclear strategy, the Vietnam War, and the development of the internet.\nMatheny talks about threats like AI-enabled bioterrorism in convincing but measured tones, Mr. Doomsday in a casual suit. He\u2019s steering Rand to investigate the daunting risks to US democracy, map out new strategies around climate and energy, and explore paths to \u201ccompetition without catastrophe\u201d in China. But his long-time concerns about biological weapons and AI remain top of mind.\nOnstage with WIRED at the recent Verify cybersecurity conference in Sausalito, California, hosted by the Aspen Institute and Hewlett Foundation, he warned that AI is making it easier to learn how to build biological weapons and other potentially devastating tools. (There\u2019s a reason why he joked that he would pick up the tab at the bar afterward.) The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nLauren Goode: To start, we should talk about your role at Rand and what you\u2019re envisioning for the future there. Rand has played a critical role in a lot of US history. It has helped inform, you know, the creation of the internet\u2014\nJason Matheny: We\u2019re still working out the bugs.\nRight. We\u2019re going to fix it all tonight. Rand has also influenced nuclear strategy, the Vietnam War, the space race. What do you hope that your tenure at Rand will be defined by?\nThere\u2019s three areas that I really want to help grow. First, we need a framework for thinking about what [technological] competition looks like without a race to the bottom on safety and security. For example, how can we assure competition with China without catastrophe? A second area of focus is thinking about how we can map out a climate and energy strategy for the country, in a way that is acceptable to our technology requirements, the infrastructure that we have and are building, and gets the economics right.\nAnd then a third area is understanding the risks to democracy right now, not just in the United States but globally. We're seeing an erosion of norms in how facts and evidence are treated in policy debates. We have a set of very anxious researchers at Rand who are seeing this decay of norms. I think that's something that's happening not just in the United States but globally, alongside a resurgence of variants of autocracy.\nOne type of risk you\u2019ve been very interested in for a long time is \u201cbiorisk.\u201d What\u2019s the worst thing that could possibly happen? Take us through that.\nI started out in public health before I worked in national security, working on infectious disease control\u2014malaria and tuberculosis. In 2002, the first virus was synthesized from scratch on a Darpa project, and it was sort of an \u201coh crap\u201d moment for the biosciences and the public health community, realizing biology is going to become an engineering discipline that could be potentially misused. I was working with veterans of the smallpox eradication campaign, and they thought, \u201cCrap, we just spent decades eradicating a disease that now could be synthesized from scratch.\u201d\nI then moved to working in biosecurity, trying to figure out, How could we increase the security around biolabs so that they're less likely to be used? How can we detect biological weapons programs? Which, unfortunately, still exist in significant numbers in a few places in the world. Also, how can we bake more security into society so that we're more resilient when it comes not only to an engineered pandemic but also natural pandemics?\nThere's a lot of vulnerability that remains in society. Covid was a demonstration of this. This was a relatively mild virus in historic terms\u2014it had an infection fatality rate less than 1 percent\u2014whereas there are some natural viruses that have fatality rates well above 50 percent. There are synthetic viruses that have close to 100 percent lethality while still being as transmissible as SARS-CoV-2. Even though we know how to design vaccines and manufacture them very quickly, getting them approved takes about as much time today as it did about 20 years ago. So the amount of time that you would need in order to vaccinate a population is about the same today as it was for our parents and even for our grandparents.\nWhen I first started getting interested in biosecurity in 2002, it cost many millions of dollars to construct a poliovirus, a very, very small virus. It would've cost close to $1 billion to synthesize a pox virus, a very large virus. Today, the cost is less than $100,000, so it's a 10,000-fold decrease over that period. Meanwhile, vaccines have actually tripled in cost over that period. The defense-offense asymmetry is moving in the wrong direction.\nAnd what do you see as our greatest adversary in biorisks?\nFirst is nature. The evolution of natural viruses continues. We're going to have future viral pandemics. Some of them are going to be worse than Covid, some of them are going to be not as bad as Covid, but we've got to be resilient to both. Covid cost just the US economy more than $10 trillion, and yet what we invest in preventing the next pandemic is maybe $2 billion to $3 billion of federal investment.\nAnother category is intentional biological attacks. Aum Shinrikyo was a doomsday cult in Japan that had a biological weapons program. They believed that they would be fulfilling prophecy by killing everybody on the planet. Fortunately, they were working with 1990s biology, which wasn't that sophisticated. Unfortunately, they then turned to chemical weapons and launched the Tokyo sarin gas attacks.\nWe have individuals and groups today that have mass-casualty intent and increasingly express interest in biology as a weapon. What's preventing them from being able to use biology effectively are not controls on the tools or the raw materials, because those are all now available in many laboratories and on eBay\u2014you can buy a DNA synthesizer for much less than $100,000 now. You can get all the materials and consumables that you need from most scientific supply stores.\nWhat an apocalyptic group would lack is the know-how to turn those tools into a biological weapon. There\u2019s a concern that AI makes the know-how more widely available. Some of the research done by [AI safety and research company] Anthropic has looked at risk assessments to see if these tools could be misused by somebody who didn't have a strong bio background. Could they basically get graduate-level training from a digital tutor in the form of a large language model? Right now, probably not. But if you map the progress over the last couple of years, the barrier to entry for somebody who wants to carry out a biological attack is eroding.\nSo \u2026 we should remind everyone there\u2019s an open bar tonight.\nUnhappy hour. We\u2019ll pick up the tab.\nRight now everyone is talking about AI and a super artificial intelligence potentially overtaking the human race.\nThat's going to take a stiffer drink.\nYou are an effective altruist, correct?\nAccording to the newspapers, I am.\nIs that how you would describe yourself?\nI don't think I've ever self-identified as an effective altruist. And my wife, when she read that, she was like, \u201cYou are neither effective nor altruistic.\u201d But it is certainly the case that we have effective altruists at Rand who have been very concerned about AI safety. And it is a community of people who have been worried about AI safety longer than many others, in part because a lot of them came from computer science.\nSo you're not an effective altruist, you're saying, but are someone who's been very cautious about AI for a long time, like some effective altruists are. What was it that made you think years ago that we needed to be cautious about unleashing AI into the world?\nI think it was when I realized that so much of what we depend on protecting us from the misuse of biology is knowledge. [AI] that can make highly specialized knowledge easier to acquire without guardrails is not an unequivocal good. Nuclear knowledge will be created. So will biological weapon knowledge. There will be cyber weapon knowledge. So we have to figure out how to balance the risks and benefits of tools that can create highly specialized knowledge, including knowledge about weapons systems.\nIt was clear even earlier than 2016 that this was going to happen. James Clapper [former US director of national intelligence] was also worried about this, but so was President Obama. There was an interview in WIRED in October of 2016. [Obama warned that AI could power new cyberattacks and said that he spent \u201ca lot of time worrying\u201d about pandemics. \u2014Editor] I think he was worried about what happens when you can do software engineering much, much faster that's focused on generating malware at scale. You can basically automate a workforce, and now you've got effectively a million people who are coding novel malware constantly, and they don't sleep.\nAt the same time, it will improve our cybersecurity, because we can also have improvements in security that are amplified a million-fold. So one of the big questions is whether there will be some sort of cyber offense or cyber defense natural advantage as this stuff scales. What does that look like over the long term? I don't know the answer to that question.\nDo you think it's at all possible that we will enter any kind of AI winter or a slow-down at any point? Or is this just hockey-stick growth, as the tech people like to say?\nIt's hard to imagine it really significantly slowing down right now. Instead it seems there's a positive feedback loop where the more investment you put in, the more investment you're able to put in because you've scaled up.\nSo I don't think we'll see an AI winter, but I don't know. Rand has had some fanciful forecasting experiments in the past. There was a project that we did in the 1950s to forecast what the year 2000 would be like, and there were lots of predictions of flying cars and jet packs, whereas we didn't get the personal computer right at all. So forecasting out too far ends up being probably no better than a coin flip.\nHow concerned are you about AI being used in military attacks, such as used in drones?\nThere are a lot of reasons why countries are going to want to make autonomous weapons. One of the reasons we're seeing is in Ukraine, which is this kind of petri dish of autonomous weapons. The radio jamming that's used makes it very tempting to want to have autonomous weapons that no longer need to phone home.\nBut I think cyber [warfare] is the realm where autonomy has the highest benefit-cost ratio, both because of its speed and because of its penetration depth in places that can't communicate.\nBut how are you thinking about the moral and ethical implications of autonomous drones that have high error rates?\nI think the empirical work that's been done on error rates has been mixed. [Some analyses] found that autonomous weapons were probably having lower miss rates and probably resulting in fewer civilian casualties, in part because [human] combatants sometimes make bad decisions under stress and under the risk of harm. In some cases, there could be fewer civilian deaths as a result of using autonomous weapons.\nBut this is an area where it is so hard to know what the future of autonomous weapons is going to look like. Many countries have banned them entirely. Other countries are sort of saying, \u201cWell, let's wait and see what they look like and what their accuracy and precision are before making decisions.\u201d\nI think that one of the other questions is whether autonomous weapons are more advantageous to countries that have a strong rule of law over those that don't. One reason to be very skeptical of autonomous weapons would be because they're very cheap. If you have very weak human capital, but you have lots of money to burn, and you have a supply chain that you can access, then that characterizes wealthier autocracies more than it does democracies that have a strong investment in human capital. It's possible that autonomous weapons will be advantageous to autocracies more than democracies.\nYou've indicated that Rand is going to increase its investment in analysis on China, particularly in areas where there are gaps in understanding of its economy, industrial policy, and domestic politics. Why this increased investment?\n[The US-China relationship] is one of the most important competitions in the world and also an important area of cooperation. We have to get both right in order for this century to go well.\nThe US hasn't faced a strategic competitor with more than two-thirds of our GDP since the War of 1812. So [we need] an accurate assessment of net strengths and net weaknesses in various areas of competition, whether it's in economic, industrial, military, human capital, education, or talent.\nAnd then where are the areas of mutual benefit where the US and China can collaborate? Non-proliferation, climate, certain kinds of investments, and pandemic preparedness. I think getting that right really matters for the two largest economies in the world.\nI recently had the opportunity to talk with Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, and we talked about US export controls. Just as one example, Nvidia is restricted from shipping its most powerful GPUs to China because of the measures put in place in 2022. How effective is that strategy in the long term?\nOne piece of math that's hard to figure out: Even if the US succeeded in preventing the shipment of advanced chips like [Nvidia] H100s to China, can China get those chips through other means? A second question is, can China produce its own chips that, while not as advanced, might still perform sufficiently for the kinds of capabilities that we might worry about?\nIf you\u2019re a national security decisionmaker [in China] and you're told, \"Hey, we really need this data center to create the arsenal of offensive tools we need. It's not going to be as cost-effective as using H100s, we'll have to pay four times more because of having a bigger energy bill and it'll be slower,\" you\u2019re probably going to pay the bill. So the question then becomes, at what point is a decisionmaker no longer willing to pay the bill? Is it 10X the cost? Is it 20X? We don't know the answer to that question.\nBut certain kinds of operations are no longer possible because of those export controls. That gap between what you can get a Huawei chip to do and what you can get an Nvidia chip to do keeps on growing because [the chip technology is] sort of stuck in China, and the rest of the world will keep on getting more advanced. And that does prevent a certain kind of military efficiency in computing that could be useful for a variety of military operations. And I think New York Times reporter Paul Mozur was the first to break the news that Nvidia chips were powering the Xinjiang data center that's being used to monitor the Uighur prison camps in real time.\nThat raises a really hard question: Should those chips be going into a data center that are being used for human rights abuses? Regardless of one's view of the policy, just doing the math is really important, and that's mostly what we focus on at Rand."

(Huawei) to the Entity List. The U.S. Government has determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that Huawei has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. BIS is also adding non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei to the Entity List because those affiliates pose a significant risk of involvement in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Huawei will be listed on the Entity List under the destination of China. This final rule also adds to the Entity List sixty-eight non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei located in twenty-six destinations: Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Madagascar, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.\nDATES:\nEffective Date:\nThis rule is effective May 16, 2019.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nDirector, Office of Exporter Services, Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, Phone: (949) 660-0144 or (408) 998-8806 or email your inquiry to:\nECDOEXS@bis.doc.gov.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\nBackground\nThe Entity List (Supplement No. 4 to part 744) identifies entities reasonably believed to be involved, or pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR, subchapter C, parts 730-774) imposes additional license requirements on, and limits the availability of most license exceptions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to, listed entities. The license review policy for each listed entity is identified in the \u201cLicense review policy\u201d column on the Entity List, and the impact on the availability of license exceptions is described in the relevant\nFederal Register\nnotice adding entities to the Entity List. BIS places entities on the Entity List pursuant to part 744 (Control Policy: End-User and End-Use Based) and part 746 (Embargoes and Other Special Controls) of the EAR.\nThe End-User Review Committee (ERC), composed of representatives of the Departments of Commerce (Chair), State, Defense, Energy and, where appropriate, the Treasury, makes all decisions regarding additions to, removals from, or other modifications to the Entity List. The ERC makes all decisions to add an entry to the Entity List by majority vote and all decisions to remove or modify an entry by unanimous vote.\nERC Entity List Decision\nAdditions to the Entity List\nUnder \u00a7 744.11(b) (Criteria for revising the Entity List) of the EAR, persons for whom there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that the person has been involved, is involved, or poses a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States and those acting on behalf of such persons may be added to the Entity List.\nPursuant to \u00a7 744.11(b) of the EAR, the ERC has determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei) has been involved in activities determined to be contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. To illustrate, Huawei has been indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on 13 counts of violating U.S. law (Superseding Indictment), including violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), by knowingly and willfully causing the export, reexport, sale and supply, directly and indirectly, of goods, technology and services (banking and other financial services) from the United States to Iran and the government of Iran without obtaining a license from the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), as required by OFAC's Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (31 CFR part 560), and conspiracy to violate IEEPA by knowingly and willfully conspiring to cause the export, reexport, sale and supply, directly and indirectly, of goods, technology and services (banking and other financial services) from the United States to Iran and the government of Iran without obtaining a license from OFAC as required by OFAC's Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (31 CFR part 560). The Superseding Indictment also alleges that Huawei and an Iranian-based affiliate, working with others, knowingly and willfully conspired to impair, impede, obstruct, and defeat, through deceitful and dishonest means, the lawful government operations of OFAC.\nFurther, Huawei's affiliates present a significant risk of acting on Huawei's behalf to engage in such activities. Because the ERC has determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that the affiliates pose a significant risk of becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States due to their relationship with Huawei, this final rule also adds to the Entity List sixty-eight non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei located in twenty-six destinations: Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Madagascar, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Switzerland,\n( printed page 22962)\nTaiwan, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Without the imposition of a license requirement as to these affiliated companies, there is reasonable cause to believe that Huawei would seek to use these entities to evade the restrictions imposed by its addition to the Entity List. As set forth in the Superseding Indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York, Huawei participated along with certain affiliates in the alleged criminal violations of U.S. law, including one or more non-U.S. affiliates. The Superseding Indictment also alleges that Huawei and affiliates acting on Huawei's behalf engaged in a series of deceptive and obstructive acts designed to evade U.S. law and to avoid detection by U.S. law enforcement.\nIn light of the foregoing, Huawei and sixty-eight non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei raise sufficient concern that prior review of exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR involving these entities, and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denials on shipments to these entities, will enhance BIS's ability to prevent activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.\nFor all of the entities added to the Entity List in this final rule, unless authorized by the\nSavings Clause\nin this final rule, BIS imposes a license requirement for all items subject to the EAR and a license review policy of presumption of denial. Similarly, no license exceptions are available for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to the persons being added to the Entity List in this rule except as allowed in the\nSavings Clause\nin this final rule.\nThis final rule adds the following entity to the Entity List:\n(1)\nHuawei Global Finance (UK) Limited,\nGreat Britain;\n(2)\nProven Glory,\nBritish Virgin Islands;\nand\n(3)\nProven Honour,\nBritish Virgin Islands.\nVietnam\n(1)\nHuawei Technologies (Vietnam) Company Limited,\nHanoi, Vietnam;\nand\n(2)\nHuawei Technology Co. Ltd.,\nHanoi, Vietnam.\nSavings Clause\nShipments of items removed from eligibility for a License Exception or export or reexport without a license (NLR) as a result of this regulatory action that were en route aboard a carrier to a port of export or reexport, on May 16, 2019, pursuant to actual orders for export or reexport to a foreign destination, may proceed to that destination under the previous eligibility for a License Exception or export or reexport without a license (NLR).\nExport Control Reform Act of 2018\nOn August 13, 2018, the President signed into law the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which included the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) (Title XVII, Subtitle B of Pub. L. 115-232 (132 Stat. 2210); 50 U.S.C. 4801et seq.), which provides the legal basis for BIS's principal authorities and serves as the authority under which BIS issues this rule. As set forth in sec. 1768 of ECRA, all delegations, rules, regulations, orders, determinations, licenses, or other forms of administrative action that have been made, issued, conducted, or allowed to become effective under the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 4601et seq.) (as in effect prior to August 13, 2018 and as continued in effect pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701et seq.) and Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783 (2002), as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013, 78 FR 16129 (March 13, 2013), and as extended by the Notice of August 8, 2018, 83 FR 39871 (August 13, 2018)), or the Export Administration Regulations, and are in effect as of August 13, 2018, shall continue in effect according to their terms until modified, superseded, set aside, or revoked under the authority of ECRA.\nRulemaking Requirements\n1. Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. This rule is not an Executive Order 13771 regulatory action because this rule is not significant under Executive Order 12866.\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to nor be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501et seq.) (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This regulation involves collections previously approved by OMB under control number 0694-0088, Simplified Network Application Processing System, which includes, among other things, license applications and carries a burden estimate of 42.5 minutes for a manual or electronic submission. Total burden hours associated with the PRA and OMB control number 0694-0088 are not expected to increase as a result of this rule. You may send comments regarding the collection of information associated with this rule, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Jasmeet K. Seehra, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), by email to\nJasmeet_K._Seehra@omb.eop.gov,\nor by fax to (202) 395-7285.\n3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications as that term is defined in Executive Order 13132.\n4. Pursuant to sec. 1762 of ECRA, this action is exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requirements for notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date.\n5. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by 5 U.S.C. 553, or by any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601,\net seq.,\nare not applicable. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.\na.

      "text": "A year ago, the US government introduced chip sanctions aimed at hobbling China\u2019s ability to develop advanced artificial intelligence. But those sanctions had loopholes that allowed Chinese firms to keep buying and building chips used to train some of the world\u2019s most advanced AI algorithms. Today, the US announced it is tightening controls to try to close those gaps.\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Commerce Department, also impose new rules for reporting the sales of other types of advanced chips, new controls on sales of advanced chipmaking equipment and design software, and statutes to prevent Chinese companies from obtaining chips through foreign subsidiaries.\n\u201cThis is a doubling down by the Biden administration on the goals of last year\u2019s export controls,\u201d says Gregory Allen, who is director of a center for advanced studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and supports the restrictions. \u201cThe Biden administration has moved to close the most important loopholes and has clearly signaled its intention to close any future ones that are discovered.\u201d\nThe restrictions introduced a year ago marked a new era of techno-competition between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration says these controls are needed to prevent China from harnessing AI for military ends. China has accused the US of trying to stifle its technological and economic progress.\nThe 2022 rules prevented firms from selling powerful AI training chips capable of sharing data between one another at the fastest speeds, something needed to build the most powerful computer clusters. The controls barred the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, Nvidia, from selling H100 and A100 chips, the world\u2019s most powerful AI training chips, to companies in China. However, Nvidia quickly developed an alternative product called H800 and A800 that skirted US controls by communicating with other chips within a cluster at 400 gigabytes per second instead of 600 gigabytes per second, below the threshold set by previous rules. Although they are slower than the most advanced chips, the H800 and A800 are still useful for building powerful AI applications.\nChinese tech companies, including Bytedance, which owns TikTok, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, have reportedly placed $5 billion worth of orders for H800 chips in recent months. It is unclear whether those sales will go through before the new restrictions come into effect.\nAt an event in Beijing this week, the Chinese search giant Baidu announced a new version of its most capable language model, called Ernie 4.0. Baidu says the performance of this model matches that of the AI model behind ChatGPT. The company said it used tens of thousands of chips to train Ernie 4.0. It did not specify the type of chip that was used, but a source at the company, who asked to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, confirmed that Nvidia chips were used.\nThe new rules will bar companies from selling chips based on how fast they can compute and their power density, or the amount of processing power packed into a square area. The US government did not name the H800 chip, but it is widely seen as a target of the new controls.\nAllen says that new restrictions on chipmaking equipment may be just as important as the tighter rules around sales of AI training chips. These rules will ban the sale of some equipment outright, whereas previous controls hinged on their end use, preventing Chinese companies from obtaining equipment by obscuring what they intended to do with it.\n\u201cThese controls maintain our clear focus on military applications and confront the threats to our national security posed by the PRC government\u2019s military-civil fusion strategy,\u201d US secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement issued by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security.\nThe government\u2019s 2022 restrictions have proven controversial among US chipmakers, with some reportedly balking at the prospect of further controls.\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association, a body that represents US chip firms, issued a statement in response to the new restrictions that signaled its concern. \u201cWe recognize the need to protect national security and believe maintaining a healthy US semiconductor industry is an essential component to achieving that goal,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOverly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the US semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere. Accordingly, we urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies.\u201d\nUS chip restrictions may have helped boost China\u2019s domestic chip industry, which is thought to lag behind that of the US, Taiwan, and South Korea by many years. In September, Huawei, a company that has been a particular target of US export controls, announced the Mate 60, a smartphone featuring a 7-nanometer chip manufactured by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, China\u2019s most advanced chipmaker. The 7-nanometer manufacturing process is relatively advanced, suggesting that SMIC has made technical advances more rapidly than expected or has been able to skirt export controls.\nThe tighter controls also come at a tricky diplomatic moment, as the US government is seeking to improve relations with China. Members of the Biden administration have traveled to Beijing in recent months to meet with Chinese officials. President Biden may meet with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a meeting of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members in San Francisco next month.\n\u201cThe US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and stop destabilizing global industrial and supply chain,\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said yesterday in response to a question about the possible tightening of restrictions.\nThe US is unlikely to do that, says Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War, a 2022 book about the geopolitical role of semiconductors. \u201cThe new rules explicitly list tech transfer to several of China's own leading AI chip design firms,\" he says, and may be updated annually. \"Tension\" over chips\u2014and the AI capabilities they enable\u2014is likely to remain at the center of China-US relations,\u201d Miller says."
