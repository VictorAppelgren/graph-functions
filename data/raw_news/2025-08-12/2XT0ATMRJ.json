  "title": "Jalen Ramsey says 'it ain't no gray area' in Pittsburgh Steelers training camp",
  "description": "The Steelers' new cornerback came to Pittsburgh via trade this offseason and spoke about training camp in the \"Pivot Podcast.\"",
  "content": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have had a busy offseason in 2025. The franchise kicked things off by trading a second-round pick to Seattle for wide receiver DK Metcalf before signing quarterback Aaron Rodgers to be their starter at the most important position in sports.\n\nChanges weren't limited to the offense, though. Pittsburgh traded away safety Minkah Fitzpatrick to the Miami Dolphins for cornerback Jalen Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith in addition to a draft pick swap.\n\nRamsey brings another veteran presence to the Steelers' secondary. He spoke on an episode of the \"Pivot Podcast\" with former NFL players Ryan Clark, Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder today about his experiences in Pittsburgh so far and his respect for Steelers coach Mike Tomlin.\n\n\"All the essence of what football is about, he emphasizes it,\" Ramsey said. \"Toughness, being well-conditioned... it ain't no gray area. It's black and white. This what we about around here.\n\nWere y'all tough today? Were you well conditioned? Were you running to the ball? Were you on your alignment, your assignment, your technique? Like, it ain't no excuses.\"\n\nRamsey, a three-time first-team All-Pro, is entering his 11th season in the NFL. He spent the last two years in Miami and made the Pro Bowl in 2023 despite missing seven games.\n\nPrior to his stop in Miami, Ramsey played three and a half years in Los Angeles with the Rams. He was part of the team that won the Super Bowl in 2021.\n\nPittsburgh lists him as the first-team nickel cornerback on the latest depth chart with Joey Porter Jr. and Darius Slay at the outside cornerback spots. Porter Jr. is the lone returning starter from last season when the Steelers had one of the worst pass defenses in the NFL (27th in yards allowed).\n\nPittsburgh still made the playoffs as a 10-7 wild-card team and has its eyes set on another playoff berth with Rodgers at quarterback.\n\nThe Steelers won their preseason opener against Ramsey's former team, the Jacksonville Jaguars, 31-25. They host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2 of the preseason on Saturday, Aug. 16.",

      "text": "Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh Steelers agree to one-year contract\nThere's a new sheriff in town in Pittsburgh.\nVeteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers have agreed to terms on a one-year contract, the team announced Thursday night. The completion of the deal is contingent on Rodgers passing a physical.\nRodgers will fly to the Steel City to sign with the team ahead of mandatory minicamp next week, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Gerry Dulac and NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\nThe Steelers will be the third team Rodgers has played for in his career. He spent his first 18 years in the NFL with the Packers and the last two seasons with the Jets.\nRodgers, who will turn 42 next season, led New York to a 5-12 record in his only full season with the team. The 20-year NFL veteran missed almost the entirety of the 2023 season when he ruptured his Achilles four plays into his first game with the Jets.\nThe 2024 season was statistically one of Rodgers' worst, according to composite statistics like passer rating \u2013 a stat in which Rodgers is the all-time career leader \u2013 and ESPN's QBR. Rodgers finished last year with a 90.5 passer rating, 1.8 points below the league average. His 48.0 QBR ranked 31st, just behind Kirk Cousins, C.J. Stroud and Aidan O'Connell.\nThe four-time NFL MVP now joins the Steelers, trying to bring them back to the playoffs for a third straight year and win their first postseason game since 2016.\nPittsburgh finished the 2024 season with a 10-7 record and lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the wild-card round.\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "Jalen Ramsey trade details: Dolphins deal star CB to Steelers in blockbuster move\nJalen Ramsey is on the move.\nOn Monday, the Miami Dolphins agreed to a trade that sends the All-Pro cornerback to the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to the cornerback himself. In return, the Dolphins are reuniting with three-time All-Pro safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, whom they originally drafted in the first round in 2018.\nRumors have been swirling around Ramsey since before the NFL draft, after Miami announced its mutual intentions to seek a trade. As the Dolphins entertained offers, it was unclear which team would come forward with the necessary compensation to complete a deal.\nRamsey still has four years remaining on his deal, including the entirety of a three-year, $72.3 million extension he signed prior to the 2024 season. According to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, the trade to Pittsburgh included a $1.5 million raise for this season. Ramsey is expected to earn $26.6 million in 2025.\nDespite his strong play, committing big money to the 30-year-old cornerback likely depressed the market. Still, the deal eventually came to fruition.\nAccording to Over The Cap, Ramsey's status as a post-June 1 trade means the Dolphins will get a $6.75 million cap hit in each of the next three seasons, plus a nearly $5 million hit in 2028. However, the move also saves them nearly $10 million in 2025 space, $18.3 million in 2026, $20.1 million in 2027, $31.2 million in 2028 and $12.4 million in 2029.\nFor the Steelers, Ramsey adds to a secondary that already looked strong on paper. Joey Porter Jr. and Beanie Bishop Jr. are two solid young players at cornerback, and veteran Darius Slay also signed on in free agency. With Fitzpatrick going back to the Dolphins as part of the trade, DeShon Elliott and free agent signee Juan Thornhill are expected to start at the two safety spots.\nJalen Ramsey trade details\nSteelers receive:\n- CB Jalen Ramsey\n- TE Jonnu Smith\n- 2027 seventh-round pick\nDolphins receive:\n- S Minkah Fitzpatrick\n- 2027 fifth-round pick\nIt's a straight-up, player-for-player trade, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Steelers add a strong piece to their secondary but lose another one. The same goes for the Dolphins, who bring back the safety they drafted with the No. 11 overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft."

      "text": "Star receiver DK Metcalf traded from Seahawks to Steelers in blockbuster deal, per reports\nDK Metcalf wanted to play elsewhere. He got his wish.\nOn Sunday, the eve of NFL free agency, multiple reports said the former Seattle Seahawks wideout was dealt to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a second-round pick in this year's draft.\nThe NFL Network reported the deal was for five years and $150 million.\nMetcalf requested a trade Wednesday after spending the first six seasons of his pro career in Seattle, the team that drafted him in the second round (64th overall) in the 2019 draft.\nThe two-time Pro Bowl receiver joins a Steelers receiving corps that, outside of George Pickens, lacks a true No. 1 target. Who will be throwing him the ball next season remains a question, as Pittsburgh could bring back Russell Wilson (or backup Justin Fields) for the starter role. Wilson and Metcalf overlapped for three seasons in Seattle.\nSeahawks general manager John Schneider told a local radio station \"we are talking to a ton of teams, taking offers, seeing what that looks like\" in the aftermath of Metcalf's request.\nAccording to Spotrac, Metcalf had one year worth $18 million on his current contract. NFL Network reported the Steelers are giving him a four-year, $132 million extension ($33 million per year) that puts him under contract with his new team through 2029."
