      "feedback": "Your draft is factually solid but can be tightened for clarity and precision. Remove the repetitive “XPGIRT4RH; 2UU8NMSWU” tags at the end of each sentence and instead place a single citation after each claim that needs support. Add a specific citation for the regulatory approval of walnut‑shell use (e.g., ISO 18486 or JIS R 1060) and for studies that quantify reduced road‑maintenance costs; this will back the claim that walnut shells lower rutting and cracking. Insert a source for the safety‑benefit statement (“Improved traction directly translates to better vehicle safety”) such as a traffic‑safety report or industry safety audit. For Soilbuild, cite a source that confirms the company’s sustainability initiatives align with regulatory trends (e.g., Singapore’s Green Building Index or BCA guidelines). Finally, split the final synthesis into two shorter sentences—one summarizing the additive innovation, the other summarizing Soilbuild’s operational excellence—to improve readability.",
