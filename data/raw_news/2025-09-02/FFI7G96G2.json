  "content": "ComEd\u2019s leading reliability, community engagement and infrastructure make it a top national utility for attracting business development projects CHICAGO, September 02, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ComEd is again named a national leader when it comes to boosting jobs and investments across northern Illinois, based on the latest recognition by Site Selection Magazine. Today, the publication released its annual Top Utilities in Economic Development, recognizing ComEd for its nation-leading grid and daily economic development work that position the region for economic growth. This marks the 11th time ComEd has earned the Top Utilities distinction and the fourth time in the last five years. Year after year, grid enhancements put ComEd\u2019s reliability track record as one of the best in the nation, making the region a highly sought destination for companies with power intensive needs. \"At ComEd we recognize that access to reliable power is fundamental to growing the economy, and businesses of all sizes can find it here in northern Illinois,\" said Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd. \"This region offers best-in-class infrastructure, along with a top notch workforce \u2014 it's no wonder we\u2019re a top choice for investments that bring thousands of jobs a year to our communities.\" Based on a review of corporate relocations and expansion data from 2024, Site Selection finds that ComEd\u2019s investments in modern infrastructure and engagement with employers, communities and the workforce once again place the company in the top category for U.S. utilities. ComEd continues to drive new levels of business growth to the region every year, with the economic development team helping secure 15 new commercial projects last year alone, with these plans set to add nearly 1,400 jobs and more than $17 billion in local capital investment from those new companies. \"From grid and transmission improvements to energy efficiency, EV programs, solar development and workforce development, ComEd covers the waterfront when it comes to all-around economic development leadership,\" said Adam Bruns, editor in chief of Site Selection, noting the contribution that solid infrastructure investment made in helping Illinois rank No. 4 in the nation in the September issue\u2019s Global Groundwork Index rankings. \"Of particular note is the ComEd team\u2019s thought and action leadership when it comes to dealing with the unprecedented high-load power demand from data centers.\" ComEd is making investments to support its customers\u2019 growing power demands, while upholding its commitment to affordability and reliability. Last year the company was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest, and it demonstrated a best on record reliability performance, even amid a record number of storms and severe weather facing the region. Since investments began in the Smart Grid program, customers are seeing 57 percent fewer outages. This translates to real savings for businesses, with an estimated $4.3 billion in avoided outage-related costs incurred.\n\n\"We're proud to see ComEd recognized again as one of the nation's top utilities, as our partner plays an invaluable role in supplying northern Illinois businesses and residents alike with the energy they need to thrive,\" said Christy George, president and CEO of the Illinois Economic Development Corporation. \"Illinois' robust and reliable infrastructure is consistently a major draw for growing companies, underscoring ComEd's contributions to our state's standing as a global business powerhouse.\" Business development projects supported by ComEd in the last year run the gamut of industries and include quantum computing, data centers, logistics, and a range of manufacturing projects, from pharmaceutical to solar. Many cite ComEd\u2019s leading reliability as a key driving factor for their decision to locate here in northern Illinois. \"ComEd has been a tremendous partner to PsiQuantum from the start. They supported us in our first meetings with the state and showed the creativity and can-do attitude that gave us confidence to grow in Illinois,\" said Josh Richman, Executive Vice President of Market Development, PsiQuantum. \"Their business-friendly approach continues to create opportunities for innovation, investment, and economic growth both at the IQMP and across Illinois.\" In addition to strong infrastructure and reliability, businesses looking to grow in northern Illinois have access to a range of clean energy programs aimed at helping them meet their sustainability goals, including solar rebates, EV and fleet funding and an energy efficiency portfolio providing about $170 million in business incentives last year alone. ComEd also maintains competitive rates and bills that are among the lowest in the Midwest, with the average commercial and industrial customers paying about 21 percent and 37 percent less, respectively, than customers in the top 20 metropolitan areas, and less than the national bill average, according to EEI rate reports for 2024. \"Power is now one of the most important factors in site selection, and ComEd\u2019s outstanding reliability and access to clean and competitive power are a key reason that businesses are deciding to grow and relocate in Grundy County and across northern Illinois,\" said Nancy Norton, President and CEO of Grundy County Economic Development. \"In addition to its strong infrastructure, the team at ComEd is instrumental in the planning process and works to support businesses as they develop, launch and chart their growth for the future.\" ComEd is one of two Exelon utilities recognized this year by Site Selection, with peer operating company PECO also making the list of top utilities this year.

ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company, a Fortune 200 company and one of the nation\u2019s largest utility companies, serving more than 10.7 million electricity and natural gas customers.
