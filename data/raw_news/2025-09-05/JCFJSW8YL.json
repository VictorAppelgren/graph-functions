  "description": "Visuals are important, but I'm a stickler for sound",
  "content": "Achieving an authentic, cinema-like experience at home is a desire shared by many of us. Whether you have the space and budget for a dedicated movie screening room, or instead need to settle for one of the best TVs paired with one of the best soundbars in your living area, it\u2019s always nice to be able to sit back, relax and experience excellent picture and sound quality from the comfort of your own home.\n\nThis feeling is front and center at TechRadar right now as it\u2019s our Home Theater Week 2025. We\u2019re publishing a series of features, reviews and other home theater-related topics, coinciding with the annual CEDIA Expo, which kicked off on Thursday, September 4.\n\nThe first article to go live was my Kaleidescape Strato E review. This deep-dive will let you in on my full thoughts about the high-end movie player (the quick of it is, it\u2019s fantastic), but I wanted to highlight the exact moment I knew just how special a product the Strato E \u2013 and, by and large, the wider Kaleidescape product lineup \u2013 was. It has nothing to do with picture quality (although that\u2019s mind-blowing), but it's all about the sound.\n\nI\u2019m very fortunate that my partner shares my love of cinema. If anything, he loves it more, and without hesitation he can rattle off actor after actor, the movies they\u2019ve done and the awards they\u2019ve won. He\u2019s an encyclopedia. What he loves more than anything, however, is sound. As for me, with over 10 years experience writing about home entertainment and hi-fi products, I also appreciate how much sound can affect the movie-watching experience and, further, my own emotions.\n\nWhen I took delivery of the Kaleidescape Strato E, the first film I purchased from the Movie Store was Gravity. Even though it was only available in HD quality (a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray was slated for May 2025 but has yet to come to fruition), it included a Dolby Atmos soundtrack. I was sold. Having watched the movie at the cinema when it was released in 2013, I\u2019ve been waiting 12 years to see it again in comparable quality. With the Strato E at my disposal, that was now possible.\n\nDespite being a movie that has little dialogue and, in comparison to many other releases, less sound overall, Gravity is a masterclass in object placement and a genuinely great advert for Dolby Atmos.\n\nHad it have been released this year, I'm certain it would've made my colleague Matt Bolton's list of the 10 Dolby Atmos movies to test your home theater system.\n\nI had the player connected to a full Sonos home theater system \u2013 Arc Ultra, 2x Era 300s for surrounds and a Sub 3 \u2013 and from the moment the movie started, my partner and I were there in space with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The two characters are first seen way off in the distance, but you can hear them talking, albeit quietly. Their voices were perfectly placed to the front right of my seating position. And, rather than coming through clearly as if they were right there next to us, the Atmos soundtrack superbly encapsulated the distance from the viewer.\n\nAs the two of them move closer and closer to the screen, the volume increases so naturally that you could easily forget you\u2019re watching a movie rather than floating in space yourself.\n\nA little further into the movie, the soundtrack gets more involved and pushes your system\u2019s capabilities even further. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney\u2019s characters get into a spot of trouble courtesy of debris from a cascade of satellite breakups, damaging their ship and sending them spinning out of control. Fragments are flying past and I could hear each piece swooping in from behind my seating position and out in front of me. Height channels are used effectively here, too, and it really does sound like you are enveloped in the same action as the two protagonists.\n\nThe music soundtrack is also full of dynamism here. It builds instantly and becomes so intense to really signify the danger the duo are in.\n\nThe movie is replete with excellent Atmos scenes from start to finish; the final one I\u2019ll note is subtle but significant enough that it deserves a mention. When Ryan (Sandra Bullock) is left alone floating in space, scared and breathing heavily, the camera is positioned outside her spacesuit. It slowly pans inwards, ending up inside her helmet. When the camera moves inside, the soundtrack audibly changes as her breathing intensifies. It\u2019s a subtle shift, but it really does show off what Dolby Atmos can do when it\u2019s executed well, i.e. it really is as if the audience is sharing her experience.\n\nNow, I have to admit, I\u2019ve yet to see the same movie on its regular Blu-ray release, which also includes a Dolby Atmos soundtrack, so I can\u2019t vouch for any potential difference in quality. I would be confident in saying that, if you have a decent Atmos speaker system, you will unlock the full potential of this spatial audio gem.\n\nIdeally, I\u2019d recommend a soundbar or speaker system with dedicated rear speakers as you\u2019ll get a much more authentic and effective enveloping effect. However, as you\u2019ll see in our guide to the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, single-box solutions are constantly improving and are powerful enough to deliver height and scale.\n\nWhatever solution you\u2019re able to achieve in your home, make sure not to focus solely on image quality when creating a system. The soundtrack carries a movie far more in my opinion, especially one as good as Gravity\u2019s.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 One subwoofer, two subwoofers,16 subwoofers: What are the advantages of multiple subwoofers?\n\u2022 Dolby Vision 2 is here for TVs \u2013 this time it\u2019s fixing motion, bumping up HDR quality, and comes in two flavors",

      "text": "Welcome to TechRadar\u2019s Home Theater Week 2025\nThe annual CEDIA Expo kicks off this year on Thursday, September 4, and to properly celebrate both the show and the spirit of high-end home theater, TechRadar will be running a series of features throughout the week on a range of home theater-related topics.\nWe\u2019ll be reporting news from the show, and also from IFA 2025 in Berlin, Germany, where we will have boots on the ground to gather news in-person on the launches of new projectors, TVs and more.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with CEDIA Expo, it\u2019s a trade-only event that takes place in Denver, Colorado, each September, and brings tech professionals in the custom audio/video and smart home installation fields together to check out new products and attend educational seminars. And if you\u2019ve never heard of IFA, it\u2019s an annual consumer event that usually takes place around the same time as CEDIA, and features new products from a wide range of electronics manufacturers.\nWhat products can you expect to hear about in our Home Theater Week coverage? Most new TVs get introduced earlier at the CES trade show in January, but manufacturers sometimes introduce new, ultra-large versions of the best TVs at CEDIA. We\u2019ll be on the lookout for those, and also for any news of new projectors, Dolby Atmos speaker systems, soundbars, and exotic, high-ticket unobtanium such as micro-LED video walls.\nWhat to expect from Home Theater Week\nWe like to kick off Home Theater Week with a review of an exciting new product, and for this round, we\u2019ll be checking out the new Kaleidescape Strato E movie player.\nWe\u2019ve previously raved about the company\u2019s Strato C and Strato V movie players, along with the Kaleidescape Store, which lets you purchase and rent better than 4K Blu-ray quality movies with uncompressed soundtracks for playback on the company\u2019s hardware. The Strato E is Kaleidescape\u2019s least expensive 4K player yet, and it gives movie fans the highest-quality alternative to the best 4K Blu-ray players.\nAs usual, we\u2019ll be dropping lists of great movies to show off your home theater system\u2019s picture and sound capabilities. And we'll dig into Dirac Live, a sophisticated room EQ tech that\u2019s now available in under-$1,000 AV receivers and will soon be coming to Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe\u2019ll also be discussing subwoofer placement and RGB mini-LED TVs, as well as other exciting new home theater developments such as Dolby FlexConnect.\nHome Theater Week, as usual, will go out with a bang with a look at some of the world\u2019s most awesome home theater setups, and we\u2019ll be listing the coolest products and tech on display at CEDIA Expo and IFA 2025.\nThis page will be updated regularly with new stories and news coming out of the shows, so check back regularly to keep up with developments.\nThe best way to watch movies at home\nWhat better way to launch TechRadar\u2019s Home Theater Week than with a review of the best possible component money can buy for watching movies at home?\nThe Kaleidescape Strato E movie player follows in the footsteps of its Kaleidescape Strato V big brother in providing a method to download 4K Blu-ray quality movies with lossless-quality soundtracks. The main difference the Strato E brings is lower onboard storage for holding movies downloaded from the Kaleidescape Movie Store, but also a lower price, making it a more accessible option for movie fanatics.\nWith the Kaleidescape Strato E, you can say goodbye to streaming and even to 4K Blu-ray, and we\u2019re confident you won\u2019t look back.\nWhich 2025 OLED TV is the best for home theater?\nFollowing up on TechRadar\u2019s OLED TV showdown, a blind test we conducted with casual, non-expert viewers, we sat down with the same TVs again for a more in-depth evaluation, primarily using movie scenes on 4K Blu-ray with the room lights dimmed and the TVs set to Filmmaker Mode.\nIt was a tough competition, but a clear winner emerged: the Panasonic Z95B. That outcome runs counter to the results from our blind test, and it proves that you sometimes need to dig deeper to appreciate what a TV is fully capable of. Unlike last year\u2019s Panasonic Z95A, which topped out at a 65-inch screen size, the Z95B is available in a 77-inch size, making it an even more compelling home theater TV option.\nMore subwoofers = better bass\nAs home theater enthusiasts know, adding a subwoofer to your system is necessary to properly convey the low-frequency effects in Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks, and it levels up the excitement when watching movies and listening to music.\nOne subwoofer will suffice for most people, but using two or even more subwoofers can result in smoother-sounding, less directional bass. If you find the prospect of a room packed with subwoofers to be daunting, our discussion of the advantages of multiple subwoofers may very well change your mind. At a minimum, it may cause you to consider the benefits of adding at least one extra sub to your current setup.\nAl Griffin has been writing about and reviewing A/V tech since the days LaserDiscs roamed the earth, and was previously the editor of Sound & Vision magazine.\nWhen not reviewing the latest and greatest gear or watching movies at home, he can usually be found out and about on a bike.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "One subwoofer, two subwoofers,16 subwoofers: What are the advantages of multiple subwoofers?\nThe One Ring is cut from Sauron\u2019s hand by Isildur. Engines ignite as the Apollo 13 spacecraft launches into space on the Saturn V rocket. Sam Flynn battles on the lightcycle grid for the first time.\nThese are dramatic and pivotal moments in The Lord of the Rings, Apollo 13, and Tron: Legacy, respectively. And they all utilize low frequencies with sound effects or music (or both) to make the experience visceral, bringing the movie to another level.\nWithout proper subwoofer coverage in a home theater or living room, the presentation will be lacking, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not. Even if you have full-range front speakers with low bass extension, they\u2019re likely not able to reproduce the lowest frequencies found on a movie\u2019s soundtrack. Plus, the placement of those speakers is optimized for stereo, surround, or Atmos sound, not for the best low-frequency performance.\nTo get a truly cinematic experience in your home, a subwoofer is a necessity. But what about more than one subwoofer? What benefits do two or more subwoofers deliver?\nOne subwoofer: Boom\nHaving a single subwoofer in your system is an important step towards hearing the complete sonic intent of a movie. And for many, one subwoofer is the most you\u2019ll ever have in your setup, as the best soundbars like the Samsung HW-Q990F only come with one sub and can\u2019t be expanded. Even if you have a custom, component-based home theater speaker setup, you might only have the space or money for a single sub.\nIn my case, my SVS SB-1000 Pro sub supports an SVS Ultra Evolution speaker system and delivers satisfying, full bass in my living room. But even with a great performing sub, having only one in a room can lead to a few issues. While bass frequencies are generally omnidirectional, depending on how close the sub is to your listening position, it can be possible to discern where the bass is coming from. And this localization of bass frequencies can distract from what\u2019s happening on the screen.\nIn addition, no matter where a sub is placed, a single sub will inevitably create standing waves. This happens when the direct sound wave and a reflection of the sound wave meet, with the result being either a boost to the frequency (when the wave forms are in phase) or a dip at that frequency (when the wave forms are out of phase and cancel one another).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThese are also called peaks and nulls. When someone refers to a sub being overly boomy, or the bass gets sucked out of the room, it\u2019s likely because of the standing waves created by subwoofer positioning.\nThis can be helped with room treatments or room correction software that is now commonplace in surround sound processors and AVRs. But another method to help with standing waves and localization is by adding a second sub.\nTwo subwoofers: Bada boom\nIf your space allows for it, two subs are ideal for most rooms, as that configuration will start to clear up the single-sub issues discussed above.\nEven when it's in the most ideal position in your room, as mentioned, standing waves caused by direct and reflected bass waves will result in peaks and nulls in a sub\u2019s frequency response. So some frequencies will sound louder, in the case of peaks, or softer, where there\u2019s a null. A second sub, in a different location, will have its peaks and nulls at different points on the frequency curve, and when the response curves of the two subs are summed together, it leads to a more even response with more accurate bass across the frequency range for the room.\nHaving multiple subs in different parts of the room also means the bass is no longer coming from only one direction, so localization is reduced and there is a larger listening sweet spot \u2013 potentially enough to cover an entire couch instead of the single seat directly in front of the screen.\nPromotional photos used by speaker makers would have us believe that having both subs in the front of the room is the ideal setup. While it\u2019s certainly not a bad choice, especially for aesthetics and to keep cable runs to an AVR short, when it comes to overall performance, it\u2019s better to place one up front and one in the back in opposite corners of the room.\nIt\u2019s also important to make sure your AVR or processor supports multiple sub outputs, or that your subs have outputs, so you can daisy chain connect them. And always run your room EQ software \u2014 be it Dirac Live (my personal favorite), Audyssey, or a proprietary system \u2014 to help correct issues with your room.\nAll the subwoofers: Big bada boom\nMore is always better, right? Well, when it comes to subwoofers, only to an extent. When you have more than two subwoofers in your system (usually topping out at four in a home theater for non-millionaires), you\u2019ll continue to get many of the benefits when going from one to two subwoofers.\nAdditional subwoofers will have different peaks and nulls than the original sub or two because of the effect of the room, allowing for an even smoother overall frequency response and more accurate low-frequency performance. There\u2019s also even less potential for localization when there are more than two subs, since the sound will be coming from more directions.\nWith more subs comes more potential power. This is great if you have a large theater room you\u2019re trying to fill with sound, and it also means that for a mid-sized room, you can get smaller subs, which take up less floor space and might be easier to fit in with your decor.\nThere are diminishing returns beyond two subs, though, when you take into account the extra space required, as well as the extra cost. If you\u2019re a huge fan of bass or have a big theater, it\u2019s worth considering putting more than two subs in your room. For the rest of us, I\u2019d recommend sticking with two.\nNo matter what you decide \u2014 whether it\u2019s one, two, or 16 subwoofers \u2014 the important part is that you have a subwoofer in your system. After purchasing a new TV and speakers, the bass performance is usually an afterthought, if it\u2019s even thought of at all. But once you experience thumping, expansive bass in your home, your movie-watching life will never be the same.\nYou might also like\nJohn Higgins got his start in 2003 at Home Theater Magazine working in its testing lab while writing reviews on speakers, TVs, universal remote controls, HTPCs, and other various bits of AV tech.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Kaleidescape Strato E represents the easiest and most affordable way to achieve the best possible video and sound quality when watching movies and TV shows in the comfort of your own home. While it will most likely find favor with people who have custom-built home cinema setups, its ease of use and ability to integrate with any system does mean anyone can get involved. It\u2019s not cheap compared to 4K Blu-ray players, but as the cheapest 4K player from Kaleidescape, it\u2019s great value for money.\nPros\n- +\nUnrivalled video and sound quality\n- +\nAttractive and intuitive interface\n- +\nContent from the Movie Store is affordable\nCons\n- -\nLimited onboard storage\n- -\nCheapest Kaleidescape 4K player, but still an investment\n- -\nMovie Store library size differs by country\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nKaleidescape Strato E: One-minute review\nKaleidescape is a California-based company that has been at the forefront of digital home movies since 2001. While its brand name is likely known predominantly in the custom-install market for those with the space (and budget) for dedicated home theaters, the Strato E represents the most accessible route for anyone wanting to experience the best possible video and sound quality at home.\nIt\u2019s an entry-level 4K movie player, slotting itself between the Strato M 2K player and the Strato V 4K player. By this, I mean the Strato E supports 4K Ultra HD movies, along with HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR formats and is the cheapest Kaleidescape product to do so. The more expensive Strato V does the same, so to get the Strato E down to a more approachable price, Kaleidescape has dropped the internal storage from 960GB to 480GB and removed a few of the connections from the player\u2019s rear panel.\nThe limited storage is something any potential buyer should think carefully about, as it\u2019s only enough space to store around six 4K movies, downloaded from the Kaleidescape Movie Store, at any one time. The only way to expand the storage is to invest in one of the company\u2019s Terra Prime servers, but with prices for these starting at $6,955 / \u00a35,910 / AU$12,499, it\u2019s a huge extra expense.\nAside from the players\u2019 abilities, Kaleidescape\u2019s other key selling point is its Movie Store. Not only is it the only way of obtaining content to watch, but it\u2019s a gorgeous and fun interface to interact with. Content is displayed in rows that can be scrolled through quickly, with posters looking vibrant and sharp. It provides plenty of information for each title, including video and sound quality, cast and crew and even Rotten Tomatoes critic ratings. A nifty way of displaying related content also makes it great for discovering new titles.\nAs with many of the best streaming services, however, the content you have access to depends on where you live. The US gets the best version of the Movie Store, with several titles available to buy and download before they\u2019re released on physical media. While limited, I was happy with the amount of content available in Australia, where I\u2019m based, and I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of movies, which is comparable to (and sometimes cheaper than) 4K Blu-ray discs.\nThe content looks and sounds stunning via the Strato E. Colors are exemplary, blacks and shadow detail are the best I\u2019ve seen from any home-entertainment source device and Dolby Atmos soundtracks \u2013 which are delivered in full lossless audio \u2013 more than prove why Kaleidescape demands the money it does. If picture and sound quality are important to you, you\u2019ll notice a night and day difference between what the Strato E can offer compared to what you get from streaming services and, to an extent, 4K Blu-ray discs. You just need to be able to make your budget stretch to do so.\nKaleidescape Strato E: Price and availability\n- Released May 2025\n- List price: $2,995 / \u00a33,399 / AU$5,299\nThe Kaleidescape Strato E movie player was released in the US and Australia in May 2025, with a launch in the UK following soon after. It\u2019s available in all three territories from registered dealers and select online sellers.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Strato E has been introduced as a more affordable, entry-level 4K movie player and now finds itself sitting in the middle of Kaleidescape\u2019s current three-strong lineup, between the Strato M 2K player ($1,995 / \u00a32,395 / AU$3,499) and higher-specced Strato V 4K player ($4,495 / \u00a35,389 / AU$7,999).\nAt $2,995 / \u00a33,399 / AU$5,299, it\u2019s certainly still a pricey bit of kit, but considering the quality Kaleidescape offers, combined with the fact it has a similar spec sheet to the Strato V, it does present as good value.\nOne of the key differences between the Strato E and Strato V is the amount of onboard storage \u2013 480GB vs 960GB \u2013 and so if you want to download a large library of movies or TV shows, you\u2019ll almost certainly need to factor in the additional cost of one of the company\u2019s Terra Prime servers \u2013 which start at $6,955 / \u00a35,910 / AU$12,499 for a 12TB HDD \u2013 or make the leap to the Strato V.\n- Value score: 5 / 5\nKaleidescape Strato E: Specs\nBuilt-in storage | 480GB SSD |\nResolutions | Up to 4K (3,840 x 2,160) 60fps |\nBit rate | Up to 100Mbps |\nAudio support | Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, DTS-HD Master Audio |\nHDR support | Dolby Vision and HDR 10 |\nAspect ratios | 1.78:1 and 2.35:1 (automatic or user interface selectable) |\nConnectivity | HDMI 2.1 |\nDimensions | 16.26 x 2.8 x 16.26 cm / 6.4 x 1.1 x 6.4 inches |\nKaleidescape Strato E: Design\n- Excellent build quality\n- Superb remote app\n- Limited connections\nThe Strato E adopts a slightly different aesthetic to the Strato V, yet still very much looks like a premium product. Where the higher-end Strato V is made from anodized aluminum, the Strato E is built with black perforated steel. The perforations allow you to take a peek at the circuitry inside, and upon startup, a blue light glows through them. The light turns off during use so as not to distract you from the main event.\nThe ventilation afforded by the perforations means the Strato E remains cool and completely silent during use too. It has 480GB of onboard storage, which is enough for around six 4K movies downloaded from the Kaleidescape movie store.\nThis is my first time experiencing a Kaleidescape product, and, having read reviews of the company\u2019s other models and salivating over various images on its website, I was a little taken aback by just how compact the Strato E was when I opened the box. Its diminutive dimensions make it easy to accommodate in/on TV units, and, thankfully, an optional faceplate is available for mounting onto an equipment rack, along with a dual faceplate for use with a compact Terra Prime server. You\u2019ll likely need the latter if you want to hold on to more than the six 4K titles that you can save locally on the device itself.\nConnecting the Strato E to your TV or home theater system is via HDMI only and Kaleidescape provides a THX Certified cable in the box. The only other connections on the rear of the unit are an Ethernet for a wired connection \u2013 essential, as there\u2019s no Wi-Fi connectivity \u2013 a USB-A port for connecting external storage devices or a disc drive, and the 12V power input. The power cable integrates a brick, and both cables at either end of it are relatively long, so you should have little issue getting everything connected in your space.\nA remote control is also supplied. It\u2019s a simple unit, although it adopts a trapezoid shape for a touch of style. It does the job well, although it would\u2019ve been nice for it to have been backlit (my colleague Stephen Withers said the same of the Strato V\u2019s remote), although I spent the majority of my testing using Kaleidescape's smartphone app.\nThe latter offers a seamless connection to the player, provides access to the movie store and can be used as a remote to navigate menus. Plus, it has the added benefit of letting you use the phone\u2019s built-in keyboard to type in search terms.\n- Design score: 5 / 5\nKaleidescape Strato E: Features\n- Highest video quality\n- Full lossless audio\n- Extra storage options available\nWith the Strato E effectively arriving as a more affordable alternative to the Strato V, and being capable of supporting 4K HDR content, it\u2019s ultimately designed to offer the best possible video and audio quality of any home entertainment device available. It supports resolutions up to 4K (3,840 x 2,160) at a maximum frame rate of 60p. Dolby Vision and HDR10 support is also here, as is lossless audio, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\nThe key factor allowing the Strato E to deliver such high quality is that it\u2019s not limited to a file size or bit rate. Compare this to 4K Blu-ray discs that have storage limitations or the best streaming services that compress movies so they can run with minimal buffering, and you start to realize why Kaleidescape movie players command the price tags attached.\nAs mentioned earlier, the 480GB of solid-state storage means there\u2019s only enough space for up to six 4K movies, but the Strato E can upscale HD or SD movies to great effect and allow you to save more files in the bargain. For the absolute best quality, however, you\u2019ll want to stick with 4K.\nAny movies you buy will remain on your account in the cloud, so if you run out of space and want to download something new, an older movie can be removed from storage to be accessed and downloaded again at a later date.\nIf you want to build a larger library of movies, you\u2019ll need to invest in a Terra Prime server, with prices starting at $6,955 / \u00a35,910 / AU$12,499 for a 12TB HDD. Prices currently max out at $79,995 / \u00a355,500 / AU$139,999 for 123TB. A server can provide simultaneous playback to up to 25 Kaleidescape players in one home, should you have the space, need, and, importantly, budget.\nWhile the Kaleidescape Strato E is likely to be something only those with dedicated home cinema spaces gravitate towards, the fact that it can work as a standalone unit, and that it\u2019s compact, means anyone who values the best possible video and audio quality can get involved.\n- Features score: 5 / 5\nKaleidescape Strato E: Setup\n- Web-based interface provides more in-depth setting adjustments\n- Owned discs can be catalogued\n- Movie Store content is location-dependent\nKaleidescape has made the Strato E as fuss-free to set up as possible. Simply plug it into mains power, insert an Ethernet cable and connect it to your TV or AV processor via HDMI and you\u2019re away. You\u2019ll be met with some onscreen instructions that are easy to follow and understand, and you\u2019ll soon be able to access the movie store and enjoy the content.\nYou will need to set up an account with Kaleidescape, including providing card information as a means of payment to purchase movies or TV shows from the online store on an ongoing basis. While you can access essential settings via the player itself, a web-based interface offers greater control. To access this, you\u2019ll need to enter the player\u2019s IP address (found in the settings menu) into a browser on your computer.\nYou\u2019ll soon learn that the majority of settings on the web interface can be left as is because the Strato E can determine what your system is capable of in terms of video and audio quality, and optimize itself accordingly to perform at its best. For example, it will be able to determine if you have a 4K display with a 5.1-channel speaker system. If you use a projector, you can adjust the aspect ratio to fit a 2.35:1 screen.\nAside from the physical capabilities of the Kaleidescape Strato E, one of the biggest selling points of the ecosystem as a whole is the Movie Store, as it\u2019s the only method of obtaining content. Where you live will determine what you have access to due to licensing agreements, but this is also the case with many streaming services. As expected, the US store has the greatest range of content, including movies that have only just left cinemas. In Australia, where I\u2019m based and this review was conducted, I could tell early on that the library wasn\u2019t particularly vast, although many of my favorite flicks were available.\nKaleidescape says there are currently about 15K titles on the US store, around 12K and 7K on the Canadian and UK stores, respectively, and just about 5K on the Aussie store. However, since the Australian store only launched in April 2025, the amount of content already available is commendable. The company promises it will continue to populate the store with more titles in all territories where Kaleidescape players are available.\nTo help build your collection, the company offers the option to catalog any Blu-rays or DVDs you already own. I wasn\u2019t able to test this feature, but in essence, you can connect an external disc drive with the USB input to trigger the Strato E to enter a Recognition Mode. (I wasn\u2019t able to test this feature as I don\u2019t have an external disc drive.) Insert a disc, and the player will search the Movie Store for a digital version that you can then purchase to download.\nThe company says that you can usually download that title at a discounted rate, although pricing is influenced by each production studio. What\u2019s more, if you own a DVD and the Movie Store has a 4K version, you can purchase the higher-quality version if you wish.\nKaleidescape Strato E: Performance\n- Outstanding picture and sound quality\n- Interface is simple to navigate, but not always easy to search\n- High-speed internet connection is ideal\nAs soon as you finish setting up your new Kaleidescape Strato E, you\u2019re presented with the Movie Store. It\u2019s a good-looking interface that\u2019s quick to navigate using either the supplied remote or the smartphone app.\nContent is logically laid out, with a selection of recommended titles along the top row, content you\u2019ve downloaded but not yet watched on the next row down, followed by sections for paused movies, content you\u2019ve watched and anything you\u2019ve saved to your favorites list. After this are categories for genres, along with a dedicated section for 4K Dolby Vision titles.\nSearching for something specific is mostly a fuss-free affair, especially when using the smartphone app, because, as previously mentioned, you can quickly type in a title using your phone\u2019s keyboard. I was surprised (and a little disappointed) to find, however, that typing in \u2018Dolby Atmos\u2019 didn't return any results. I eventually found filters when browsing the Movie Store within the smartphone app, including one for Dolby Atmos, among many others, so the search isn\u2019t as intuitive as I had hoped.\nOne particularly good feature of the Movie Store is the ability to summon related content when hovering over a particular title. For example, when highlighting Top Gun: Maverick, press the Kaleidescape logo button on the smartphone app, or navigate to Explore > Related Content on the movie\u2019s information page using the physical remote, and the Movie Store interface kicks into action, reorganizing all available and related content around it.\nThis includes movies similar in style and genre; for the Top Gun example, I was presented with Tom Cruise movies and other content either from the same director or starring supporting actors. It\u2019s a quick and easy way to instantly discover new titles and a feature I found myself using an awful lot \u2013 not least for the aforementioned discovery, but also because watching poster thumbnails float around my TV screen was just cool to see.\nOnce you\u2019ve found something you want to watch, then, as mentioned, you need to first download it. Due to the large file sizes, a very high-speed internet connection is practically a necessity if you want to minimize the time it takes from selecting a movie to watching it. Where I\u2019m based in Australia, I can only achieve a maximum download speed of 100Mbps (multi-gigabit plans are available, just not in my apartment building), which made me nervous that it would take days to download a single title.\nWhen I set The Batman to download, it had an immediate effect on my network, and shows I was trying to watch on other services kept buffering \u2013 all of the available bandwidth was going to Kaleidescape.\nTo get around this problem, I set The Batman, along with Wicked and Gravity, to download overnight and sure enough, when I woke up the next morning, they were there. Remember when you\u2019d wake up as a kid on Christmas morning to see presents under the tree? That was the exact feeling I had that morning.\nThe app lets you know how long each piece of content took to download, with The Batman taking the longest at just under three hours (Gravity, being an HD movie, finished in 40 minutes). Kaleidescape says if you have at least a 1Gbps internet connection, you can reduce the download time of a 4K movie to around 10 minutes.\nIf you have a high-speed internet connection, you can also set the maximum download speed for Kaleidescape. For example, with a 1Gbps plan, you could set Kaleidescape to max out at 600Mbps, leaving you with bandwidth so you can continue to watch other content at the same time.\nHaving read reviews of other Kaleidescape products, and having a good understanding of what makes the brand so appealing to home theater enthusiasts, it\u2019s safe to say I had high expectations of the Strato E. And those expectations were exceeded. For context, I had the Strato E connected to an 83-inch LG G5 TV and a Sonos home theater system comprising the Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar, two Sonos Era 300 speakers for surrounds and a Sonos Sub 3.\nWatching the opening scene of Wicked, the Wicked Witch of the West\u2019s hat sitting in a puddle looked absolutely stunning. I compared it to the 4K Blu-ray version and noticed extra sharpness and detail when watching on the Strato E. Blacks were slightly deeper and the light reflection on the puddle glistened with greater intensity.\nWhat took me by surprise the most, however, was the Dolby Atmos soundtrack. When the flying monkeys swooped in from behind the viewing position and smashed out of the window, I was blown away by the pinpoint accuracy of the movement from behind my seated position and towards the screen. It really was like being in a cinema; in comparison, the effect just wasn\u2019t as pronounced when watching the Blu-ray version with the same home-theater setup.\nIt was a similar story when watching Gravity. Not only did the picture look incredible \u2013 the Strato E did a fantastic job of upscaling HD content, with the deep blacks of space well-defined and brighter lights shining with great intensity \u2013 but the Atmos mix was conveyed expertly through my speaker system. When Sandra Bullock and George Clooney\u2019s characters are spinning out of control at the beginning of the movie, the soundtrack panned around my living room to great effect.\nThe Strato E truly shines with live concert recordings. As I mentioned in this issue\u2019s lead-in, I downloaded and watched Hans Zimmer: Live in Prague \u2014 available in 4K Dolby Vision and, crucially, recorded in Dolby Atmos. I\u2019d seen the soundtrack maestro perform in Sydney earlier this year \u2014 if you ever get the chance, grab a ticket, you won\u2019t regret it \u2014 so I was curious whether a Kaleidescape playback of one of his shows could capture the same energy.\nIt did. The scale of the music hit me from the first note. My Sonos home theatre system was finally given a soundtrack that pushed its limits \u2014 I hadn\u2019t realised how convincingly it could handle the dynamics of Zimmer\u2019s iconic scores. When The Dark Knight Trilogy suite kicked in with Like a Dog Chasing Cars, the Strato E expertly reproduced the shifts from hushed, delicate passages \u2014 a lone violin or a subtle electronic texture \u2014 to the thunderous crescendos of the full orchestra, all without sounding compressed or strained.\nThat sense of contrast gave the performance real drama and made the experience feel startlingly lifelike. While I didn\u2019t have a Dolby Atmos passive speaker system to test the Strato E\u2019s talents \u2014 nor do I have a dedicated home cinema space \u2014 the player was able to deliver an impactful performance in my modest setup. Those with full Atmos rigs are in for a treat.\n- Performance score: 5 / 5\nShould you buy the Kaleidescape Strato E\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s highly subjective, but as an \u2018affordable\u2019 entry point to the best picture and sound quality available, it\u2019s worth the investment | 5/5 |\nDesign | Excellent build quality and a superb smartphone app; more outputs would be nice, but the cost would inevitably increase | 5/5 |\nFeatures | Unrestricted file size for the best quality, and can be paired with servers for more storage | 5/5 |\nPerformance | Unmatched picture and sound quality, especially content in 4K Dolby Vision and with object-based soundtracks | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want the best possible video and sound quality\nThe unrestricted file sizes mean the Kaleidescape Strato E is able to receive more information for a movie or TV show, resulting in the best possible quality of any home entertainment product.\nYou want early access to the latest movies:\nThe US gets the best version of the Movie Store, with multiple titles available before their physical release. Other countries reap some of the same benefits.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nIt goes without saying the Strato E isn\u2019t cheap, and if you want to build a large movie collection, you\u2019ll realistically need to invest in an even more expensive Terra Prime server.\nYou don\u2019t have the AV system to take advantage\nThe Strato E \u2013 and the wider Kaleidescape ecosystem \u2013 is best suited for people with high-quality home AV setups that benefit from the player\u2019s capabilities.\nHow I tested the Kaleidescape Strato E\n- Tested over a period of 4 weeks\n- Connected to LG G5 OLED TV and Sonos home theater system\n- 4K Dolby Vision and HD content used\nI tested the Kaleidescape Strato E at home in my living room, connected to an LG G5 OLED TV, partnered with a Sonos home theater system in a 7.1.4-channel configuration to take advantage of Dolby Atmos soundtracks. I wasn\u2019t able to evaluate DTS:X soundtracks, however, as my Sonos system can\u2019t decode it.\nKaleidescape kindly provided me with some credit to spend in the Movie Store, as opposed to preloading it with content, so that I would have the same experience as any new customer.\nRead more about how we test.\nFirst reviewed August 2025\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "10 Dolby Atmos movies released in 2025 that will show off your home theater system to its fullest\nGot yourself a fantastic option from our list of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars \u2013 or, better yet, a full-scale Atmos home theater system? Then, like me, you're probably always looking for something new to show it off, even if it's just to yourself.\nOur testing of the best soundbars and speakers means I get to listen to a lot of different movies on great systems, as well as just the stuff I watch at home on my own setup. I have previously covered great Dolby Atmos movies from all ages, and my pick of the top Dolby Atmos movies with a music focus, but this time out I'm focusing just on new movies released in Dolby Atmos this year.\nAs ever, I recommend watching these on physical media, using one of the best 4K Blu-ray players, for the best experience \u2013 the widest dynamic range, the sharpest detail \u2013 but however you watch them, they're great for making you feel your system was worth the money and effort.\n1. Sinners\nGiven how central music is to the themes of this movie, it's no surprise that it's one of the best-sounding films of the year \u2013 and all presented in glorious Dolby Atmos, naturally.\nThe movie follows two brothers who return to their 30s small town to open a juke joint \u2013 a bar and dancing hall \u2013 and take on a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9. But the bar attracts unwanted attention, from humans who don't want to see Black people enjoying their own space in the Jim Crow-era South, but also from non-humans who actually are very much into the bar scene.\nThere are lots of great Dolby Atmos details in the early parts of the movie, where we're being introduced to the town and local world, and then later when the movie starts to fill up with action. But the stand-out section is the song I Lied to You, performed in the juke joint.\nThe film has a few things to say about the power of music, and in particular, this section is about the ability of songs to act like time machines, bridging from now into both the past and future \u2013 and all in an incredibly powerful modern music mix.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n2. Warfare\nFrom a movie focused on beautiful music mixing to one focused on the horrific nightmare sounds of war \u2013 but as a demo of the power and spatial positioning of Dolby Atmos, I'm not sure there's any better option this year.\nWarfare follows a unit of US soldiers and their local translators in the middle of an ongoing battle during the Iraq War. The movie is based on the real-life recollections of co-director Ray Mendoza, and it takes place essentially in real-time, as the soldiers invade the home of some civilians, hunker down to monitor the situation, and then find themselves under attack from every direction.\nWhen things become dangerous, the sound is incredibly intense \u2013 it's as dynamic as it can be (a good reason to get this on Blu-ray rather than streaming, since dynamic edges can be sanded off in the latter), and it comes from all directions.\nThere's one notable explosion scene that provides a great showcase of what your system can do, and when it comes to the surround effects, the lengthy scene of a team moving through the streets in a constant firefight is hardcore demo material.\n3. Final Destination: Bloodlines\nAm I including this just because this movie rocks? Not entirely\u2026 but definitely a bit. Final Destination: Bloodlines is surely the best movie in the long-running series, in no small part because of just how meta it's become.\nIt's the usual Final Destination setup: some people have survived death due to a premonition, and now death is pulling out some very elaborate tricks to kill them one by one. The twist here is that the characters we're following didn't cheat death themselves \u2013 they're the descendants of people who did, and death still wants to tidy its mess.\nThe huge opening disaster set piece is a big Dolby Atmos showcase in itself, as a tower collapses and wrenches itself apart around us.\nBut even if the rest of the movie doesn't go that big, Atmos is still used to great effect just in the general tone-setting the movie's doing. The reason the film is so much fun is that it knows we're looking out for clues to the ridiculous deaths that are inevitably coming \u2013 and so it shows us close-ups of barbecues burning and point garden forks rattling in the wind, using the 3D soundscape to hammer that home and build the tension.\n4. The Wild Robot\nI've covered a lot of grim and violent movies so far, so let's go with something a little more family-friendly. This movie is a colorful visual treat, but that's not what we're here for \u2013 so it's good news that the sound is absolutely engrossing as well.\nThe movie is about a robot that becomes stranded on a remote island, where it starts to build a relationship with the local wildlife over time. It makes full use of the positional effect of Dolby Atmos, not just to surround you with detailed animal sounds, but also to make you feel the power of storms and rain.\nIt's a great new demo showcase of your system, and is a much less stressful watch than the other movies so far. Well, mostly a less stressful watch \u2013 as you might expect from a movie about an adorable robot befriending nature, it can be a tearjerker.\n5. Kingdom of Heaven\nThis is not a new movie from 2025, but the 4K Blu-ray with Dolby Atmos soundtrack only arrived this year, so I'm calling it a 2025 release. Gladiator II was the runner-up for this spot on the list, as our 'Ridley Scott-directed, historical drama epic' pick \u2013 but having tried both movies in our test rooms, this one delivers the more impactful demo material.\nKingdom of Heaven follows a blacksmith-turned-warrior who finds himself at the center of other people's ambitions during the Crusades, leading to a huge siege in Jerusalem. A lot more happens along the way, but good lord, this is a complicated movie, I can't cover it all.\nThe important thing here is the powerful soundtrack, which is capable of really giving your woofers a workout. The chaotic sound of battle comes from all around you, with precision to the sword clashes and yells, while the thundering of hooves from a horse charge hits you right in the gut.\n6. A Complete Unknown\nThere's always got to be something music-focused on this list, and in 2025, that's the Bob Dylan biopic and its impressive recreation of the '60s folk world.\nIt follows Dylan from his arrival in New York and breaking out as a performer, up to the moment he went electric in 1965 and split with the folk community he'd risen to fame with. It's got a range of performances, and explores his relationship with the likes of Joan Baez and Pete Seeger.\nThis isn't the most prominent Dolby Atmos mixing for positional sound, but it really leans into the 'atmos' side of things, fleshing out the clear and crisp mixing of the songs with the gentle sounds of the open-air festivals, or the movement in a club.\nThere's great dynamic range to the music, so if you've got a system with a lot of headroom, it can still have some fun \u2013 but in its quieter moments, it really makes the most of the detail your system can muster too.\n7. Nosferatu\nFrom the gentle to the dreadful. (As in, full of dread. I didn't love this movie, but I wouldn't describe it that harshly.) Nosferatu has a few moments that really seize on the 3D sound of Dolby Atmos, but it's another one that's more about the atmosphere \u2013 and even more specifically about the bass.\nThis remake of the 1922 film mixes the plot of the original with elements more directly taken from Dracula (of which the original is a thinly-veiled knock-off), so we follow Thomas, a gentle soul who leaves his wife, Ellen, to take care of the sale of a decrepit mansion in\u2026 I'm just checking my notes here\u2026 Transylvania!? Uh oh.\nThe soundtrack and score are hugely important to the menacing foreboding tone here (though the darkness-ridden cinematography is also a great visual showcase for the best OLED TVs), and you'll really get to feel the impact of a great sub \u2013 not in big bassy impacts, but the constant, unnerving thrum of the guttural voice of Count Orlok's presence.\nOther scenes really show off both the energy and subtlety in the soundtrack, though \u2013 the wolf chase being a particular stand-out.\n8. The Last Voyage of the Demeter\nI'm pulling a Dracula double! This is another movie where Atmos is used to build growing tension, but with a little more focus on the positional sound side of things.\nThe film is based on the story of Dracula stowing away aboard the sailing ship Demeter, to make his way from Europe to dreary old England. In Bram Stoker's novel, this is all told through the ship's logs in retrospect \u2013 so the movie aims to show it directly.\nWe're trapped on the ship with the crew, living not only with the general creaking and unnerving groans that come with being on a wooden ship, but also the extra creepiness of something else moving in the dark around the decks, or the ambiguity of sound ringing out into the quiet sea air.\nSometimes the air isn't so quiet, though \u2013 there's also great moments of driving rain and waves crashing around you. It's not exactly an amazing movie, but it makes for a cool sound showcase.\n9. F1: The Movie\nOkay, let's forget these subtle, atmosphere-building positional effects and let's throw some big engine sounds from side to side. F1: The Movie has some of the most incredible racing footage ever captured, and the sound to go with it.\nThe film follows Sonny Hayes, a talented-but-wasted race driver who meanders from competition to competition. When his old Formula 1 teammate, and now owner of a failing F1 team, offers him a seat to race the rest of the season, he gets a chance to show up the younger drivers and more established teams. It's Top Gun: Maverick in cars, from the director of Top Gun: Maverick \u2013 don't overthink it.\nBig, loud cars whip from left to right across your sound system, engines fire up suddenly, shocking sudden crashes boom out \u2013 this is a movie built to overwhelm and awe when the racing cranks up.\nIt also draws you into the cockpit, positioning the engine behind you, and the click of controls and the whir of the wheels where they should be. It's a great demo for a dynamic system with great surround skills.\n10. Honorable Mention \u2013 From the World of John Wick: Ballerina\nI haven't seen this yet at home, but I've seen a few people say that it has a great Dolby Atmos soundtrack, full of sharp, precisely positioned gunshots and sound that moves with the action. And given how great the sound is on the other John Wick movies, I don't doubt it.\nGreat Dolby Atmos soundbars\nLooking to upgrade?

      "text": "I thought I knew home theater bass until I experienced an 11.13.8-channel demo with an \u2018infrasonic\u2019 32-inch subwoofer\nGerman speaker maker Ascendo and France\u2019s Trinnov are known for putting on breathtaking home theater demos, and the one they teamed up for at the recent Audio Advice Live 25 consumer show in Raleigh, North Carolina, which ran from August 1-3, was perhaps the best one yet.\nFor sheer immersive audio horsepower, the joint demo utilized Trinnov\u2019s flagship Altitude 32-channel audio processor and a pair of Amplitude 16-channel amplifiers. That electronics stack was used to power an 11.13.8-channel Ascendo speaker system consisting of three The12 Passive On-Wall point source speakers up front as LCRs, a surround array consisting of The10 Passive On-Wall and The10 Passive Wedge 30 speakers, and eight The6 Passive Wedge 30 speakers used for height channels.\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned the subwoofers yet! Six The16 Sub Active Sealed subwoofers were positioned at the front of the room, and six more at the rear to enable Trinnov\u2019s WaveForming, a sophisticated type of room correction processing that can cancel out bass peaks caused by room modes while simultaneously filling in bass frequency dips for smoother and more evenly distributed bass throughout the listening environment.\nAlong with its 12-pack of 16-inch subwoofers, Ascendo also brought along a secret weapon: its The32 Pro Passive Sealed subwoofer, a model that uses an enormous 32-inch woofer to deliver \u2018infrasonic\u2019 bass that\u2019s meant more to be felt than heard. In fact, The32 Pro is specified for 109 dB output @ 10 Hz.\nOther components of the demo included a JVC DLA-NZ900 projector, that company\u2019s top 8K-capable model, paired with a madVR Envy video processor and a Kaleidscape movie player as a source.\nWe Will Rock You\nOne of the most popular home theater demo clips at Audio Advice Live 25 was Queen\u2019s We Will Rock You from the movie Bohemian Rhapsody. The song\u2019s boom-boom-clap rhythm makes it a good demo track for bass, and the movie soundtrack supplements it with the sound of a live audience stomping heavily on stadium floorboards.\nI\u2019ve watched this clip many times, but never have I heard such a precise separation between the kick drum and the sound of stomping feet as in the Trinnov/Ascendo demo. The low bass was powerful, yet detailed, and there was a physical quality to it that I\u2019ve mostly only heard in IMAX theaters.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSpider-Man: Far from Home showed off the JVC 8K projector\u2019s exceptional detail, contrast, and color definition, but it was also a showcase for the system\u2019s immersive audio prowess. And the same could be said for Top Gun: Maverick, another hugely popular demo source at Audio Advice Live, and one that I have regularly used in my testing of the best soundbars and speakers.\nThe demo clip that most left my jaw on the floor, however, was one from 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. The intense firefighting in this Michael Bay-directed depiction of an American compound in Libya under attack was vividly rendered on the 11.13.8-channel system, with the sound of bullets flying coming from all around. The low bass was again very powerful, yet controlled, and I could certainly feel as well as hear it.\nNeedless to say, this demo involved a money-no-object system \u2013 the Trinnov Amplitude 32 processor alone costs around $40,000! But I\u2019m glad I had the chance to experience it, and if you attend a future Audio Advice Live, you may get to do the same.\nYou might also like\nAl Griffin has been writing about and reviewing A/V tech since the days LaserDiscs roamed the earth, and was previously the editor of Sound & Vision magazine.\nWhen not reviewing the latest and greatest gear or watching movies at home, he can usually be found out and about on a bike.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "I test soundbars for a living \u2013 here are 3 Dolby Atmos models I\u2019d recommend without question\nI\u2019m a resident Reviews Writer here at TechRadar, and testing flashy new soundbars has to be one of the best parts of the job. And during my time here, I\u2019ve used some truly incredible Dolby Atmos soundbars that unleash powerful, expansive audio, in turn transforming your living room into a home cinema.\nBut whether you\u2019re looking to upgrade or you're a total newbie to the world of soundbars, picking out a new model can be tricky. After all, there are so many excellent \u2013 and indeed, not so excellent \u2013 options to select from. So I\u2019m here to narrow your search down a little, with 3 Dolby Atmos soundbars I\u2019d recommend without reservation.\nI\u2019ve chosen a soundbar plus sub combo, an affordable all-in-one offering, and a fully fledged multi-box surround sound system, so rest assured, these picks will be well-suited to both a range of budgets and living spaces. So, without further ado, let\u2019s dive into my top 3.\n1. Samsung HW-Q800D\nThe Samsung HW-Q800D is an absolutely incredible 5.1.2 soundbar and sub combo that envelopes your living room with powerful, spatial sound. When I reviewed this soundbar, I praised its excellent Atmos and DTS:X effects, crystal-clear dialogue replication, and fleshed-out set of features.\nOn that note, there's so much to sink your teeth into, from Q-Symphony, which pairs the soundbar with your Samsung TV\u2019s inbuilt speakers for more expansive sound, through to SpaceFit Surround Pro, which optimizes audio for your room. You even get Game Mode Pro for more immersive experiences on the PS5 and other modern consoles \u2013 pretty cool!\nI had the HW-Q800D set up in my apartment for the last half-year or so and absolutely loved it \u2013 the sub just ended up being overkill for my living situation, so I swapped it out for the all-in-one Marshall Heston 120.\nBut if you have a medium or large-sized room and don\u2019t have to worry about neighbors down below, the HW-Q800D\u2019s sub is going to add a real fun factor to movie nights. You\u2019ll hear the rumble of booming bass, which is key for the ultimate home theater experience.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBest of all? You won\u2019t even have to pay anywhere near list price for this bar anymore. Yep, it launched at $999 / \u00a3749 / AU$1,099, but I\u2019ve already seen the Samsung HW-Q800D on sale for less than \u00a3550 in the UK. Definitely keep your eyes peeled for a sweet deal.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q800D review.\n2. Sony HT-S2000\nIf you\u2019re on a bit more of a budget, though, the Sony HT-S2000 easily earns my recommendation. It\u2019s an all-in-one bar that supports both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and despite its low price, supplies awesome audio quality.\nThis 3.1 channel soundbar harnesses Sony\u2019s virtual processing prowess to produce impressively immersive sound. Vertical Surround Engine helps to elevate sound effects, music and dialogue to screen level and above, while S-Force Pro Front Surround provides a virtual \u2018wrap-around\u2019 so that you\u2019ll sense surround effects coming from the sides of your room.\nSure, you\u2019re not going to get that ultra-imposing bass due to the lack of an external sub. But still, in the time that I spent with the HT-S2000, I found that its bass output was well above average for a budget-friendly bar, thanks to the abilities of its two internal woofers. The soundbar handles dialogue very nicely too, so you won\u2019t have to switch subtitles on to understand what\u2019s being said on screen.\nThe Sony HT-S2000 was already great value when it launched at $499 / \u00a3449 / AU$695, but now you\u2019ll regularly find it for even less. It\u2019s popped up for less than $300 / \u00a3300 a fair few times, which is astonishingly good for the service Sony provides you with here.\nRead our full Sony HT-S2000 review.\n3. JBL Bar 1300X\nAaaand finally... we have the JBL Bar 1300X, which I\u2019m recommending for those in search of a ready-made surround sound system.\nThis 16-channel model comes with a main soundbar, detachable and rechargeable surround speakers and a sub, meaning you really will be at the center of all the action. Oh, and quick note, this model is just called the JBL Bar 1300 in the UK and comes with a slightly smaller sub.\nWhen we tested the JBL Bar 1300X, we were wowed by its ace Atmos effects, generous helping of four HDMI ports and natural, clear presentation of music, as well as dialogue in movies. Partner that with excellent low-frequency output, fantastic build quality and plenty of wireless connectivity options, and you\u2019re looking at something really special.\nSure, the JBL Bar 1300X was on the pricier side of things when it launched at $1,699 / \u00a31,299 / around AU$2,570. But I\u2019ve seen it floating around for considerably less from time to time. I even spotted it going for around the \u00a3900 mark in the UK, which is an absolute steal for one of the best soundbars around.\nRead our full JBL Bar 1300X review.\nYou might also like\n- Want to see more top-tier options?

      "text": "Dolby Vision 2 is here for TVs \u2013 this time it\u2019s fixing motion, bumping up HDR quality, and comes in two flavors\n- Dolby Vision 2 will include a new image engine, and adaptive 'Content Intelligence'\n- Dolby Vision 2 Max has 'Authentic Motion' and is designed for high-end TVs\n- Hisense is the first TV maker to announce support\nDolby has announced the successor to its advanced HDR format, Dolby Vision. Appropriately enough, it's called Dolby Vision 2, and over time it will replace both the current Dolby Vision standard and the Dolby Vision IQ variation, which adapts the picture based on the ambient brightness in the room.\nHowever, it's not the only option: Dolby is also introducing Dolby Vision 2 Max, which is an even more advanced version designed specifically for high-end TVs, such as elite OLED TVs and new RGB mini-LED TVs.\nDolby Vision 2 will be supported by Hisense on high-end TVs that use the MediaTek Pentonic 800 chips, which is the first chip with full support for the new standard, and includes the groundbreaking 116-inch RGB Mini-LED that we recently tested in-depth.\nThis chip is used by other TVs, but we're not sure which models will support Dolby Vision 2, because which chips are used in which TVs is not always as logical as you might thing \u2013 I've reached out to all the major TV companies to ask about their plans to support Dolby Vision 2 in the future, and will publish any news I receive.\nSo what's actually new this time? There's a big focus on adapting the picture to improve it while keeping the artistic intent the same, and this time that's not just about colors and luminance \u2013 Dolby Vision 2 Max also brings with it some exciting-sounding tweaks to motion handling.\nContent Intelligence is here\n\"Dolby Vision 2 redefines how we think of Dolby Vision to unleash the full capabilities of modern TVs while giving artists unprecedented opportunities to push their creative boundaries further than ever before,\u201d says John Couling, Senior Vice President, Entertainment at Dolby Laboratories, in the introduction to the new format.\nThere are two main areas that have changed in all kinds of Dolby Vision, with one particularly big change in Dolby Vision 2 Max.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPart of the pitch of Dolby Vision was always that it helps to adapt the original mastered picture to the capabilities of your particular TV, and Dolby Vision 2 will expand on this depending on what's happening in the content itself, as well as what screen you're using. There are a few key new features, and Dolby's wrapped them all up in the name 'Content Intelligence'.\nFirst up is Precision Black, which is designed to \"reduce consumer frustration that the image is 'too dark'\" by boosting content that's just too murky to see on some TVs (too late for that infamous Games of Thrones battle, but so it goes), but promises to do this \"without compromising artistic intent.\"\nNext up is Light Sense, which aims to adapt the picture based on the ambient lighting in the room, but in combination with \"reference lighting data from the content source\" for best results \u2013 making it an improvement (and a replacement for) the adaptive picture of Dolby Vision IQ.\nAnd there are optimizations for live sports, including \"white point adjustments\" and \"motion control\" that are both specifically aimed at improving live sports broadcasts.\nThe second big change after Content Intelligence is a \"redesigned and even more powerful image engine\" powering Dolby Vision 2. There's not much detail on this yet, but basically Dolby has upgraded the tools that power the creation and playback of Dolby Vision content, offering new options for creators, while also promising that \"content in Dolby Vision will look even more astonishing when enjoyed on a Dolby Vision 2 display.\"\nAuthentic Motion to the Max\nThe more mysterious part of Dolby Vision 2 so far is the Max version. Dolby says that it will have more to share on this later, but it's basically designed to make the most of the highest-performing TVs, including bi-directional tone mapping and new advanced tools for enthusiasts.\nThe overall idea is to push the highest-performing TVs as far as they can go, to really give you visual bang for your buck when it comes to punchy and clear picture quality.\nBut we do know that Dolby Vision 2 Max will have the feature I'm most intrigued by out of everything mentioned so far (and probably most videophiles will feel the same): Authentic Motion. It seems to do for motion handling what Dolby Vision does for dynamic range, enabling it to be tweaked on a \"shot-by-shot basis\" by the creators when mastering the movie or TV show, presumably rather than having the TV set to a particular motion setting that overrides everything.\nDolby makes clear that this is \"the world\u2019s first creative driven motion control tool\" [emphasis mine], and that this will \"make scenes feel more authentically cinematic without unwanted judder\".\nIt might provide the perfect solution to a potential issue with Filmmaker Mode on TVs: we don't want artificial motion smooth to make movies look unnatural, but TVs aren't always capable of showing the 24fps movement of film, with some timing issues that create juddery effects.\nIf this can be solved by having the filmmakers add in some motion adjustments to the film master encode, which are then communicated to the TV through Dolby Vision 2, that could be a win all around: always natural motion, but only when it's needed.\nThe only downside? Dolby Vision 2 Max is aimed at the highest-end TVs, but it may be more mid-range models that benefit most from some smart motion control. However, we've tested high-end TVs this year that suffered from juddering out of the box and needed some tweaking, so there's definitely room for it everywhere.\nIf some of the updates in Dolby Vision 2 feel a little vague in terms of what improvements you should expect from them, don't worry \u2013 I'll be speaking to Dolby in-depth about the changes soon, to get a sense of how big a change this will be in practice.\nWhen will all this arrive? More info on availability and timing will come later \u2013 even if makers of the best TVs support it, we also need content to be produced using it. So far, Canal+ is confirmed to be on board for that, but we'll need to hear a lot more.\nWhen it comes to the TV makers, we know very little. Dolby confirmed that Hisense will support it on some TVs, but other manufacturers have generally declined to comment about support, or haven't confirmed either way at the time of writing \u2013 however, it's my understanding that Samsung is likely to stay committed to HDR10+ only.\nYou might also like\u2026\n- Our list of the best OLED TVs \u2013 if you want to read about some of today's highest-end TV options\n- The battle for the top OLED TV is more intense in 2025 \u2013 and this time it's not just about brightness\n- 3 new 4K Blu-rays to add to your collection from August 2025\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

      "text": "4 awesome 4K Blu-rays for evaluating your TV's picture\nDiscs that will reveal the capabilities of your TV\nAs one of TechRadar\u2019s TV reviewers, 4K Blu-ray is integral to my testing process. That\u2019s because 4K Blu-ray discs provide consistent picture quality, along with a higher bitrate compared to streaming (128Mbps for 4K Blu-ray vs 17-25Mbps average with 4K streaming). They also provide uncompressed soundtracks, making them a superior option for audio testing.\nAs part of TechRadar\u2019s Home Theater Week, I thought I\u2019d share what 4K Blu-rays I use for testing not only the best TVs, but also the best soundbars and best projectors. There are four discs I routinely use, though my rotation has changed over time and I\u2019m always discovering new discs for testing via our monthly Blu-ray Bounty feature, where we review the best 4K Blu-ray releases from each month.\nBlack levels and contrast\nThe main disc I use for testing a TV\u2019s black levels and contrast is The Batman. This disc was mastered at 400 nits of brightness, compared to the industry standard of 1,000 nits, making it a challenging source for TVs and projectors to handle. One of the movie\u2019s opening scenes, at Mayor Mitchell\u2019s house, is great for testing how well a TV can reveal shadow detail, and it also shows up any black crush (a loss of detail in darker areas).\nThis scene also features shots of lamps and torches balanced against dark surroundings, which is perfect for evaluating contrast. Here I\u2019ll be looking for both high peak brightness and deep black levels, something the best OLED TVs often display.\nOther discs I use for testing black levels and contrast include Alien: Romulus, a movie that features many scenes with deep shadows, especially in the shots of space and dark tunnels.\nNosferatu also features several challenging dark scenes, such as one where Hutler first visits Count Orlock\u2019s castle. Dark City is a new 4K disc that I will be adding to my rotation, thanks to its many scenes with deep black levels and strong contrast.\nColor\nThere are several discs I use for color testing, but my primary one is Wicked. Not only does Wicked feature incredibly vibrant and punchy colors that convey the magical feel of Oz, but its colors also strike a balance between gaudiness and realism.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Wizard & I scene is my go-to as it features a tree with bright pink flowers, Elphaba\u2019s green skin and the blues of the students\u2019 uniforms.\nOther discs I use for evaluating color include the animated movie The Wild Robot. I have also used La La Land, looking at the vibrant blues and purples in the night sky and Mia\u2019s yellow dress in the A Lovely Night musical scene. All of these discs are great for evaluating color, but Wicked is the most essential one for me.\nMotion handling\nFor motion testing, my primary 4K discs are No Time To Die and Top Gun: Maverick. In No Time To Die, a scene early on where a camera pans across a cemetery on a rocky hillside can easily reveal judder and motion blur artifacts. Watching it also lets me explore a TV\u2019s motion settings to determine if they can reduce those artifacts without adding a soap opera effect to movies.\nTop Gun: Maverick features many scenes with fast-moving jets and quick panning camera shots. Famously, Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski said this movie should be viewed with all motion settings turned off. Unfortunately, that won\u2019t be a good idea for TVs that are ill-equipped to handle fast motion.\nBlack and white uniformity\nAlthough it may not be the first thing you\u2019d think of nowadays, it\u2019s important to test TVs using black and white images. These are useful for testing screen uniformity, which is a TV\u2019s ability to evenly display areas of the same color, black, white, and gray included.\nMany recent movies (Mad Max: Fury Road and Furiosa, Oppenheimer) feature black and white scenes, and more black and white movies are getting 4K Blu-ray releases, so there is a practical benefit here as well.\nWhile I\u2019ve come across several great black and white movie discs in my Blu-ray Bounty reviews, I continue to use the black and white scenes in Oppenheimer, especially one where Strauss and Oppenheimer first meet at the university. This scene has an excellent balance of black (Oppenheimer\u2019s suit and the office), white (the common room window, building and some details on Strauss\u2019 suit) and gray tones, making it perfect for testing screen uniformity.\nSound quality\nAnother important aspect of TV testing is the set\u2019s built-in sound. How accurate is the bass, soundstage and speech performance? It\u2019s important to know this with TVs and some projectors, as it will tell you if you\u2019re going to need to factor a soundbar into your budget.\nMy main 4K disc for testing sound is The Batman. I use the Batmobile/Penguin chase scene where the Batmobile is first introduced. The rumble of its engine is perfect for testing bass power and control, and the ever-present rain is good for testing height channels. With constantly swerving traffic, bullets and car collisions, this scene is also great for testing sound effect mapping, or the connection between the sound and the action on screen.\nI also use Top Gun: Maverick for testing Dolby Atmos and surround effects, primarily the Darkstar mission in the movie\u2019s opening. I will also use musicals such as Wicked and La La Land for testing, evaluating the clarity of vocals, the balance of instruments, and the soundstage width.\nYou might also like\nJames is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

      "text": "The best TV, chosen by our reviewers for all budgets\nI\u2019ve been testing and reviewing the best TVs for nearly 30 years and have witnessed massive shifts in technology from analog to digital, and from CRTs to flat-panel displays. TVs today are better than ever and can offer incredible value, and my vantage point as a longtime reviewer puts me in a perfect position to identify which models provide the best performance for the price. That perspective informs this guide, which ranks the best new TVs across a range of categories to help you find the best fit for your needs and budget.\nMy TV team and I have conducted hands-on reviews of the TVs in this guide using a process that includes objective measurements made with specialized test equipment. That measurement data is presented in the benchmark graphs that accompany each one of our TV reviews and is presented in the \u2018In-depth analysis\u2019 section for the entries in this guide.\nA TV\u2019s performance can\u2019t be judged by measurements alone, however, so we also do an extensive subjective evaluation using reference movie scenes and TV, primarily on 4K Blu-ray and regular Blu-ray disc formats to ensure consistency during testing. You can read about the testing process I developed with my team in our full article on how we test TVs at TechRadar.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a budget-priced QLED TV that offers great picture quality for the price, or a more premium OLED model that pushes the performance envelope and also has cutting-edge features for gaming, this guide has you covered. The latest TVs can sometimes get clouded in a swirl of jargon, so check out our glossary in the \u2018How to choose\u2019 section for descriptions of the tech terms used in this guide.\n\u2b63 Read more\nWhy you can trust TechRadar's choices\nAt TechRadar, we test TVs ourselves on-site, with the review team led by Al Griffin, an ISF-trained video calibrator with nearly three decades of AV product testing experience. He has trained our staff reviewers to use industry-standard testing equipment to measure parameters such as TV brightness and color accuracy, and to balance them with subjective aspects of picture and sound quality, because measurements can only take you so far in determining a TV\u2019s overall performance.\nOur evaluation process goes beyond picture quality to encompass features and gaming performance, and overall value. Ratings are provided for various sections in our tests, and we provide measurement graphs that also feature comparable TVs, so you can see how well \u2013 or not \u2013 a TV fares against its competition to aid your decision-making.\nEach TV in this guide is vouched for by a team member who has summarized our evaluation, providing a concise yet in-depth overview of the information provided in our review.\nThe quick list\nWant the simplest guide to the best TVs around?

Previously, I was editor of Sound & Vision magazine, and I'm an ISF-trained TV calibrator. Having worked in AV product testing and tech journalism for almost three decades, I\u2019ve had my eyes on basically every flagship TV available. I shaped this list with the help of our reviewers in addition to my own experience, to cover as many bases as possible for different budget or viewing needs.\nAugust 27, 2025\nReplaced the Panasonic Z95A with the newer Panasonic Z95B as our 'Best for sound' top choice based on our recent testing.\nThe best TVs, listed\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best 4K TVs in our list. We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best TV for most people\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: Having reviewed both the LG C4 and its LG C3 predecessor, I can confirm that LG\u2019s new OLED TV is a solid upgrade and a great TV overall. The C4 features a new Alpha 9 AI Gen 7 processor that brings a noticeable boost in brightness, and it also improves detail and color in HDR sources. LG C4 OLEDs are well-equipped gaming TVs, with four HDMI ports that support 4K 120Hz (and up to 144Hz for PC gaming), VRR, and ALLM. A new Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode preset gives you a director-approved picture out of the box and, with the C4 available in 42- up to 83-inch screens, there\u2019s a C4 sized to fit any situation, from desktop gaming to high-end home theater. The C4 isn\u2019t as bright as flagship OLED TVs such as the LG G4 and Samsung S95D, but its picture quality is almost as good, and you\u2019ll pay far more for those models. It really hits a sweet spot, delivering on every front for a lower price than nearly every other OLED TV on the market, making it the best OLED TV for most people.\nRead our full LG C4 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a reasonably priced OLED: The LG C4 strikes a perfect balance between performance, features, and value in an OLED TV.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for movies: The C4 has excellent contrast, color and detail. Combined with its new Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode, it\u2019s an ideal TV for movies.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for gaming: The C4 has four HDMI 2.1 ports and is packed with gaming features for console, PC, and cloud-based gaming.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want great built-in audio: The C4\u2019s built-in speakers are fine, but those wanting better bass and more immersive sound should check out the Sony Bravia 8 or Samsung S95D.\n\u274c You want the brightest TV available: LG\u2019s C4 is brighter than its C3 predecessor, but it doesn\u2019t match mini-LED TVs such as the Hisense U8N, or flagship OLED TVs such as the Samsung S95D.\n\u274c You want the cheapest OLED: LG\u2019s entry-level B4 is the company\u2019s cheapest OLED TV series, although it\u2019s not as bright and isn\u2019t available in as many sizes.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nIn use, the C4 delivers a picture that\u2019s bright enough for viewing in rooms with moderate-to-high ambient light levels. I measured peak brightness on the LG C4 at 1,065 nits, a great number that puts it above most other rival mid-range OLED TVs. When watching in dim lighting conditions, its picture really pops to life, displaying rich color, deep blacks, and detailed shadows. Like other OLED TVs, the C4 looks good over a very wide viewing angle, so there\u2019s never a bad seat in the house \u2013 a benefit when watching sports with a group.\nThe same Alpha 9 AI Gen 7 processor responsible for the C4\u2019s picture-quality boost over the C3 also improves sound by upmixing audio for a virtual 9.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos presentation. When I reviewed the C4, I found the dialogue in TV shows and movie soundtracks to be consistently clear, and there was a good sense of spaciousness with the AI Sound Pro mode active. As with most TVs, bass was on the light side, so if you want cinematic sound it will be best to add a good soundbar. The C4 provides several features designed to work exclusively with LG soundbars, including Wow Cast, which wirelessly transmits Dolby Atmos audio from the TV to the soundbar, and Wow Orchestra, which syncs up the speakers in the TV and the soundbar for enhanced audio presentation.\nThe new webOS 24 smart interface on the C4 has been updated for a more streamlined look. A main feature is Quick Cards, which lets you store apps and settings in various categories including Games, Music, Home Hub, Sports, and Home Office. Content recommendations are located below these, though, like on other smart TV interfaces, they routinely push you toward a free ad-supported TV portal (LG Channels, in this case). LG\u2019s Magic Remote makes navigating everything easy, and a new Quick Menus provides easy access to picture and sound settings.\nThe LG C4 is a powerhouse TV for gaming. Its four HDMI 2.1 ports support 4K 120Hz, Nvidia G Sync and AMD FreeSync, and Dolby Vision gaming, and it\u2019s one of the first TVs to be 144Hz certified by Nvidia. Similar to Samsung TVs, the C4 has cloud-gaming options, with Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, Utomik and other services supported. A Game Optimizer mode is automatically enabled when a gaming console is connected, reducing input lag as low as 9.2ms and providing a convenient pop-up game menu for making quick gaming-related adjustments.\nThe 55-inch version of the LG C4 is now available for around $1,399, making it a very good value. You\u2019ll pay nearly twice that amount for more flagship OLED TVs in that screen size from LG, Samsung, and Sony, and the picture quality advantages of those premium models, while real, aren\u2019t something that most viewers will miss. LG\u2019s C-Series OLED TVs have long represented a sweet spot for OLED TVs, and the C4 carries on that tradition.\nLG C4 test results\nThe best budget TV\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: The Roku Plus and Select series were the company\u2019s first Roku-branded TVs, and while good, the Pro series was the budget TV home run I was waiting on. Starting at $899 for a 55-inch model, with 65- and 75-inch screen sizes also available, Roku Pro Series TVs step up with mini-LED backlight tech for a significantly brighter picture than you\u2019ll get in the mid-range Roku select series. Otherwise, the Roku Pro\u2019s picture is mostly free of the backlight blooming you see on some other budget mini-LED and regular LED TVs and it has comprehensive HDR support (including Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats) plus a Smart Picture Max automatic mode that lets the TV do all the picture setup work for you and adapts dynamically for different content. It\u2019s well-equipped for gaming with two HDMI 2.1 ports supporting 4K 120Hz input along with VRR (with FreeSync) and ALLM and its side-mounted speakers deliver much better-than-average sound for a budget TV. Of course, being a Roku TV it has the famous Roku interface, which I think leapfrogs over other smart TV screens when it comes to ease of navigation.\nRead our full Roku Pro series review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a premium TV without the price tag: The Roku Pro Series is a great value considering it is the most premium offering in the company\u2019s TV lineup.\n\u2705 You want to wall-mount your TV: Although it can be installed on a stand, Pro series TVs are designed to be wall-mounted and have a neat shadowbox case that makes it look like a framed painting.\n\u2705 You want an affordable TV with great built-in sound: The Pro Series was designed to be used without a soundbar, and its front-firing speakers provide reasonably full sound and can play loud.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want the brightest possible picture: Although picture quality on Pro series TVs is generally very good, the Hisense U8N offers superior brightness and better overall performance.\n\u274c You want a sophisticated smart platform: The Roku smart TV interface is basic compared to other smart TV platforms. For some, that\u2019s a benefit because it's so easy to use, but others may want a more sophisticated smart interface.\n\u274c You want the best gaming TV: While the Roku Pro Series offers a strong suite of gaming features, it's limited to two 4K 120Hz ports. Samsung and LG options on this list offer more flexibility and features.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe 55-inch Roku Pro series TV we tested offers above-average brightness for a more budget-focused set \u2013 we measured around 900 nits peak brightness on a 10% window pattern and over 400 nits on a fullscreen pattern. While those are far from the most impressive numbers we\u2019ve seen on a mini-LED TV, they compare well to competition at the same kind of official price. The Pro series also has excellent color performance and, as we noted in our review, we \u201cdidn\u2019t experience any backlight blooming thanks to the TV\u2019s well-implemented local dimming.\u201d Its picture also shone with sports, partly because of its above-average brightness for a budget TV, but also because of the very good motion handling provided by its native 120Hz QLED display panel.\nA benefit of the Pro series\u2019 sturdy \u201cshadowbox\u201d frame, which is slighty thicker than normal and was designed to accommodate a wall-mount installation, is that there\u2019s space for side-mounted speakers \u2013 a configuration that allows for better audio clarity than the bottom-mounted speakers on most budget TVs. In our review, we found that there was \u201cplenty of volume on tap\u201d and that you could even get away with not using a soundbar. Which brings up another Pro series benefit: the TV can be wirelessly paired with the company\u2019s wireless soundbars, subwoofers, and surround speakers.\nRoku made its name with streaming devices featuring an intuitive, simple-to-navigate onscreen interface, and that same smart interface is provided on Pro series TVs. Along with providing easy access to your favorite streaming apps, picture and sound settings can be quickly accessed by pressing the star button on the Pro\u2019s remote control, which also has a built-in mic for voice commands. Roku had also promised a new feature called Roku Backdrops that\u2019s similar to the \u201cambient\u201d artwork display modes on other smart TVs, though that feature has yet to materialize.\nGaming support on the Pro series is surprisingly robust for a budget TV. It has two HDMI inputs with 4K 120Hz, VRR (with FreeSync), and ALLM support. Input lag in the TV\u2019s game mode is a low 9.4ms, which is the type of performance we see in the best gaming TVs. The Pro series automatically switches to its game picture mode when a gaming console is connected and turned on, and the contrast-rich picture quality also extends to gaming, making it easy to see details in the darker parts of the screen.\nThere are good reasons why the Roku Pro Series is selected as the best budget TV pick in our guide. For less than $900 for the 55-inch model, you\u2019re getting a TV with a bright mini-LED backlight, impressive picture quality and gaming performance, very good built-in sound, great gaming performance and features, and one of the best smart TV interfaces in the biz. And with major sales events now a regular occurrence, you can expect to pay much less than that if you keep your eyes open.\nRoku Pro series test results\nThe best mid-range TV\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: Hisense is known for its lineup of mini-LED TVs that combine impressive performance with excellent value. The Hisense U8QG best exemplifies this with a picture that\u2019s bright and eye-catching enough that it makes you wonder why you\u2019d need to spend more on flagship TVs from other brands. Available in 55- to 85-inch screen sizes, with a 100-inch model also sold in the US, the U8QG supports both the Dolby Vision and HDR10+ high dynamic range formats and uses the Google TV (VIDAA in the UK and Australia) smart TV system for streaming. A built-in 4.1.2-channel speaker array delivers loud, immersive sound, though, as I found when I reviewed the U8QG, it quickly shows its limitations when tasked with conveying deep bass effects in movies. Gaming is a strong point with the U8QG, which features 4K 165Hz support, along with FreeSync Premium Pro, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+ gaming. It has a sturdy and attractive design with a pedestal stand, though viewers with plenty of sources may find that the TV\u2019s three HDMI 2.1 inputs aren\u2019t enough to connect all their devices.\nRead our full Hisense U8QG review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want to watch in a bright room: The U8QG has excellent brightness, and when that\u2019s combined with its effective anti-reflective screen, you have a TV that works well for bright room viewing.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for movies: Refined local dimming allows the U8QG to deliver powerful contrast and detailed shadows. Also its high brightness reserves lend maximum punch to the highlights in movies and TV shows with HDR.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for gaming: With three HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K 165Hz, FreeSync Premium, and both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ gaming, the U8QG is loaded with gaming features, and the low 9.9ms input lag means gaming is highly responsive.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want to use the TV\u2019s built-in speakers: The U8QG 4.1.2-channel speaker array has powerful, immersive sound, but its built-in subwoofer can audibly distort with some loud action movies. Movie fans will be better off adding a soundbar.\n\u274c You watch lots of broadcast TV: While the U8QG features a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner for watching NextGen TV broadcasts in the US, its Google TV Live grid guide fails to display info for those channels and you can\u2019t navigate the grid guide\u2019s tuner section.\n\u274c You regularly watch with groups: The U8QG\u2019s picture loses contrast and color saturation when viewing from far off-center seats \u2013 something to be wary of if you like to invite large groups of people over to watch sports.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nMy time spent reviewing the U8QG supports Hisense\u2019s brightness claims for the TV \u2013 it\u2019s easily one of the brightest I\u2019ve measured, beating its U8N predecessor by a fair amount in that regard. It also has a wider color gamut than the U8N, with the result that pictures have consistently rich color. The TV\u2019s refined local dimming ensures that movies have powerful contrast and good shadow detail, and there\u2019s virtually no sign of the backlight \u201cblooming\u201d artifacts that LED-based TVs are prone to. Brightness is high enough that you can watch in well-lit rooms, and the U8QG\u2019s effective anti-reflection screen helps to reduce glare from overhead lights. The main picture quality issue with the U8QG is that it loses contrast and color saturation when viewed from far off-center seats. Motion handling is also just average, with the picture benefiting from custom judder and blur adjustments in the Clarity sub-menu.\nThe U8QG\u2019s 4.1.2-channel, 72W speaker array is one of the biggest enhancements over its Hisense U8N predecessor, which had a 2.1.2-channel built-in speaker array. The TV\u2019s sound is powerful, with clear dialogue, and an impressive level of immersion with Dolby Atmos soundtracks, and there\u2019s a Room Acoustic Tuning feature that uses the mic built into the TV\u2019s remote to automatically tune the sound for your viewing space. While the U8QG\u2019s sound quality is good overall, low-frequency effects in some movie soundtracks can cause the built-in subwoofer to audibly distort, requiring adjustment of the Bass Boost level in the Sound Advanced Settings menu.\nThe U8QG uses the Google TV Smart TV platform in the US and its own VIDAA platform in the UK and elsewhere. Google TV has a relatively uncluttered homescreen that\u2019s easy to navigate, and it supplies every streaming app you could want. There are plentiful settings for picture and sound in the TV\u2019s setup menu, and there\u2019s also a convenient Quick Menu that pops up at the bottom of the screen for making adjustments without having to wade deep through a menu system. The U8QG has a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner for viewing \u2018NextGen TV\u2019 digital broadcasts in the US, and while Google TV provides a Live Guide for navigating tuned channels, in my testing this feature didn\u2019t work.\nThree HDMI 2.1 ports are provided on the U8QG, and these support a wide range of gaming features such as 4K 165Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, ALLM, Dolby Vision gaming, and HDR10+ gaming. Hisense\u2019s Game Bar menu \u2013 accessible through the TV\u2019s Quick Menu \u2013 lets you easily make gaming-related adjustments while continuing to play the game in the background. The U8QG\u2019s input latency measured in Game mode was 9.9ms \u2013 the best result I\u2019ve yet seen from a Hisense TV, and one that puts it in the company of the best gaming TVs on the market.\nThe price of the 65-inch U8QG that I tested has quickly dropped in the US, making it and other screen sizes, which have also received large discounts, an excellent value given the TV\u2019s features and performance. (Pricing has not been announced in the UK, though I will update this when that information is available.) At a launch cost of $2,199 in the US, the U8QG was initially quite pricey, so if UK prices turn out to be equivalent, it will take its value down a notch.\nHisense U8QG test results\nThe best TV for cheap big-screen thrills\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: The Hisense U6N is a cheap, mini-LED TV that outshines its budget price tag. It offers a wide array of features and delivers great performance in most areas. Available from 55 to 85 inches, I reviewed the 65-inch model. I was surprised by how good details and texture looking during my testing, taking on a more refined quality than anticipated given the price. Its colors were also dynamic, with plenty of punch. The U6N carries comprehensive HDR support, including both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and it really shone with 4K HDR movies and shows. Although it doesn't carry all the gaming features we look for, limited to 4K at 60Hz rather than 120Hz, I still found gaming to be an enjoyable experience, with VRR and Dolby Vision gaming offering a taste of next-gen. Its sound is on the thin side and I had to make some adjustments to get motion just right for sports \u2013 in particular, the AI Sports mode was too garish, so the best option was the Standard Mode with the Motion preset set to Smooth. But even with that in mind, the U6N's value is undeniable. When you're paying under $1,000 for an 85-inch screen with mini-LED, a good list of gaming features and a solid Google TV smart platform, you won't find much to complain about. I can't recommend the U6N enough for an affordable option.\nRead our full Hisense U6N review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a big screen without the price tag: The Hisense U6N offers a big screen mini-LED at a bargain price, but without major compromises.\n\u2705 You want a good quality picture in a large sized screen: The U6N has a mini-LED panel that delivers punchy colors, refined details and solid contrast at a cheap price.\n\u2705 You want a solid, budget gaming TV: Although it lacks 4K 120Hz, the U6N does still support 4K 60Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and ALLM to deliver a good overall gaming experience.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want to avoid using a soundbar: The Hisense U6N does unfortunately suffer from limited sound, with thin-sounding speakers and a narrow soundstage. A soundbar is recommended.\n\u274c You want the best TV for sports: Sports fans will find that they need to make some specific adjustments to settings to improve motion \u2013 and even then, the U6N struggles compared to pricier TVs.\n\u274c You want the complete gaming package: The U6N may be a solid gaming TV, but it doesn't support 4K 120Hz like the best gaming TVs.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nWe tested the 65-inch Hisense U6N and found that while it delivered low peak brightness of 651 nits on a 10% window, its fullscreen brightness, which measured 580 nits, does make it a solid option for daytime viewing. In our review, we were impressed with its level of detail and strong textures, punchy colors and solid contrast. One surprise was its ability to maintain details in clothing during dark scenes, most challenging of which was The Batman. The U6N's picture falters in places, suffering from inconsistent motion and limited viewing angles, as well as black levels sometimes taking on a gray hue. But for the money, the U6N's picture is still leagues above other rival cheap TVs.\nBuilt-in sound is unfortunately one of the Hisense U6N's weakest parts. Its speakers deliver good dialogue clarity and credible bass levels, but struggle in every other area. There's no sense of direction to the speakers and the soundstage is narrow and although Dolby Atmos is supported, it really isn't obvious during viewing. I would recommend a soundbar be used with the U6N, and thanks to its cheap price, it should be easy to add a budget bar in.\nThe U6N comes equipped with Google TV in the US, and I've generally found Google TV to be useful for tailored recommendations of movies and TV shows in the past, but found the large banners ads on the home screen a bit of an eye-sore. I found during testing that the U6N features plenty of picture settings for tweaking the picture and said in my review that \"menus are well laid out and user-friendly, with settings neatly organized\".\nWhile the Hisense U6N does lack some of the major features we look for in the best gaming TVs, such as 4K 120Hz and HDMI 2.1 ports (except for eARC), as I said in my review \"gaming on the U6N is still a fun experience\". Its still very responsive at 4K, 60Hz and has a decent 13.2ms input lag time. There's also VRR, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM on offer, all of which work effectively to deliver a solid gaming experience. I was also glad to see that the U6N's good picture quality for movies carried over into gaming, displaying the same vibrant colors and refined details.\nValue is where the Hisense U6N shines. Priced at $700 for its 65-inch model, but it's been as low as $549(!) before, you're getting a great TV for a very affordable price. Not to mention that we've seen its 85-inch model for under $1,000, which is a serious bargain for a mini-LED TV with this much to offer. It does face stiff competition from other budget TVs, but there aren't many who offer this great a performance in a larger screen size for less.\nHisense U6N test results\nBest OLED for bright rooms\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Samsung\u2019s flagship OLED TV stood out from its premium OLED TV competition when I tested it by way of its bright picture and its ability to reject screen reflections when viewing in bright rooms. A new, next-gen QD-OLED display panel is responsible for the S95F\u2019s high brightness, while a more effective 2.0 version of the Glare Free screen found on its Samsung S95D predecessor accounts for its impressive bright room performance.\nCombine all that with the S95F\u2019s exceptional picture processing (including AI-based enhancements), razor-thin design (with an external One Connect box for connectivity), and cutting-edge gaming features such as 4K 165Hz support, and the Samsung S95F proves to be an obvious, if pricey, choice for as the best TV for viewing and gaming in bright rooms.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You\u2019re viewing in a bright room: The S95F\u2019s Glare Free screen is highly effective at eliminating reflections, making it a great choice for viewing in a room with bright lighting.\n\u2705 You want exceptional picture quality: The S95F\u2019s picture has spectacular color, contrast, brightness, and detail, and that level of picture quality remains consistent across a range of room lighting conditions.\n\u2705 You want an OLED TV for gaming: Not only does the S95F display great picture quality for movies and TV, but it also has impressive gaming performance, with smooth, responsive action and ultra-low input lag.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want a TV with Dolby Vision HDR: The S95F supports the HDR10+ high dynamic range format, but not the more widespread Dolby Vision format.\n\u274c You want to save money: The S95F is Samsung\u2019s flagship OLED TV, and has a premium price tag to match.You can find other OLED TVs for less, but they won\u2019t have the same level of bright room performance.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to mess with picture settings: The S95F\u2019s Filmmaker Mode required adjustments to present an accurate picture in bright viewing conditions, something that wasn\u2019t the case with its LG G5 rival when we tested it.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nIn my Samsung S95F review, I called it \u201can overall fantastic TV,\u201d one with powerful contrast, rich colors, and finely rendered details. Unlike many other OLED TVs, its picture quality stands up well in bright rooms, and that\u2019s helped along immensely by Samsung\u2019s effective Glare Free screen. While many other TVs will show at least some degree of mirror-like reflections from room lamps or overhead lights, the S95F eliminates them.\nThe S95F\u2019s color gamut coverage is among the best I\u2019ve ever measured, and its AI-based processing features, such as Real Depth Enhancer, give pictures a near-3D-like quality.\nThe S95F\u2019s 4.2.2 channel, 70W speaker array delivers good overall sound quality with clear speech, and Samsung\u2019s Object Tracking Sound+ feature ensures that sound effects and dialogue are accurately positioned to follow the onscreen action.\nThe TV\u2019s soundstage feels narrow, however, and I experienced some bass buzz when pushing the volume to its highest level. Of course, some of these shortcomings are to be expected from a TV with such a slim design, and the S95F does offer special features that improve sound performance when paired with Samsung\u2019s soundbars.\nThe S95F\u2019s Tizen smart TV interface is among the best available, and improvements have been made to the latest version that introduce compelling new features such as a Daily+ hub and Samsung Art Store, which is a subscription-based service that lets you display famous artworks from a wide range of museums.\nOf course, there\u2019s still Samsung Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming from apps, including Xbox. A new quick menu is a welcome addition that lets you easily access regularly used picture settings without having to explore menus, and there are also AI picture and sound modes that do all the work for you.\nSamsung TVs typically score high marks for gaming, and the S95F is no exception. The TV\u2019s many gaming features include 4K 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and ALLM, all supported across four HDMI 2.1 ports. It also has Samsung Gaming Hub, which is a portal for cloud-based gaming from apps such as Xbox, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Luna.\nThe S95F\u2019s ultra-low 9.5ms input lag results in smooth gaming performance, and there was no sign of screen tear during my testing. As I said in my Samsung S95F review, \u201cPlaying Battlefield V, intense combat sequences were exciting to play and targeting was easy, snappy and extremely responsive.\u201d\nThe S95F is undeniably a pricey TV, but this is a case where I feel confident that the performance and features justify the cost. Its price matches up with premium OLED TV rivals such as the LG G5, and competition with that model should lead to price drops from Samsung over time.\nAnother part of the S95F\u2019s value story is its Glare Free screen, which does a better job of eliminating reflections in bright rooms than any other OLED TV on the market. You can find a different OLED TV for less money, but it won\u2019t deliver as consistent a picture in a range of lighting conditions as the S95F.\nSamsung S95F test results\nBest cheap OLED TV\nSpecifications\n1 minute summary: The LG B4 is the best way to get an OLED TV for an affordable price. While I found that it didn't offer the same level of quality, features and performance as its more premium siblings, the C4 and G4, when I tested it, the B4 is no slouch itself. It delivers impressive pictures with plenty of detail and contrast alongside excellent motion handling and dynamic colors. It also comes well-equipped for gaming, with four HDMI 2.1 ports for the first time in the B series' history, which support 4K 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming and more \u2013 and it comes in a new 48-inch size this year. Crucially though, it does all this for less than any other OLED TV and doesn't make too many compromises doing it. I found that it doesn't have the best built-in sound (the Sony Bravia 8 is a better option for that) and you can tell that its brightness is more limited than most other OLEDs, but that doesn't stop the B4 delivering the cinematic contrast that this screen tech is famous for, and I enjoyed watching it a lot \u2013 especially for the price it is.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want OLED's contrast for less: The B4 offers access to an OLED TV for cheaper than any other OLED out there \u2013 and still delivers in key areas.\n\u2705 You want an affordable gaming OLED: It may be a cheaper OLED, but the B4 is still stacked for gaming, with four HDMI 2.1 ports all offering 4K 120Hz and Dolby Vision gaming support.\n\u2705 You want a great smart TV platform: LG's webOS is one of the best out there, delivering top-tier streaming support in a friendly interface, and with very smart quick access to key settings.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You need the best built-in sound: While it delivers on the picture front, the B4's built-in sound is limited, lacking the quality of sets such as the Sony Bravia 8.\n\u274c You want the brightest OLED around: The B4 offers below-average brightness levels compared to other OLEDs, including its mid-range sibling the LG C4.\n\u274c You want the most extensive HDR support: While the B4 does support the popular Dolby Vision format, it does not support HDR10+.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nEquipped with less advanced OLED panel than more expensive models, the LG B4 still manages to deliver great picture quality. In our review, we found the B4 to be accurate in terms of color and contrast, especially when using its Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode. We also found its motion handling to be excellent. Where it's limited is brightness when compared with more premium OLEDs \u2013 we measured its peak HDR brightness at 656 nits, compared with the step-up LG C4's 1,024 nits. That's a big difference, and you can very much see it. We found this limited brightness to slightly take away from the B4's dynamic picture, but it still delivers the deep, perfectly precise contrast that OLED is famed for, and the lack of brightness is much less of an issue if you watch mostly in controlled lighting environments. At this price, the B4's picture is more than accomplished enough and befitting of an OLED TV \u2013 it's just that will get more if you pay more.\nSound is one of the B4's weaker areas. We found in our review that the B4's speakers have \"decent balance and dialogue comes across clear\", but this is where the best parts end. Dolby Atmos reproduction isn't particularly refined and bass is limited. Pushed to higher volumes, we also found the B4's sound becomes \"a bit thin and edgy\". For those looking for the best built-in sound, look to the Sony Bravia 8. Although the B4's sound \"does the job\", we'd recommend one of the best soundbars to complement the B4's picture.\nEquipped with LG's own smart TV platform, webOS 24, we described the interface as \"one of the best going\" in our review, praising its Quick Cards for easy app organization and navigation. We also really liked the Quick Menu thanks to its convenience for access to useful settings such as picture mode, sound mode and more. The only real negative with webOS is its large banner ad at the top of the home menu, but most smart TV platforms have this today. In terms of smart TV interfaces, not many can compete with webOS \u2013 much to the B4's benefit.\nThe B4 is an excellent option for gaming, especially for those looking for a more affordable OLED. Stocked with four HDMI 2.1 ports, supporting 4K, 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, variable refresh rate (including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G Sync) and auto low-latency mode, the B4 is seriously well equipped for gamers. It also comes with LG's Game Optimizer for easy settings adjustments, including a Boost Mode that drops the B4's input lag to an ultra-low 9.1ms. We were suitably impressed with the B4's gaming prowess.\nThe B4 is a well featured TV for the money, but its value ultimately comes in to question when put up against the step-up LG C4. For the 65-inch model of the B4, the official price is around $1,499 as opposed to $1,599 for the C4, and C4 comes with that brightness boost and faster processing if you can stretch your budget a little. Still though, the B4 is fairly priced for what it offers, and is still the cheapest OLED TV you can get \u2013 and price cuts during the regular sales will bring it down further.\nLG B4 test results\nThe best TV for sports viewing\n7. Samsung QN90F\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\n1 minute summary: The Samsung QN90F is an impressive update on its QN90D predecessor, with a new \u2018Glare Free 2.0\u2019 screen allowing for viewing in bright rooms without any picture quality compromises. This makes it an excellent choice for daytime sports viewing, and a Wide Viewing Angle feature ensures that pictures look good from any seat in the house.\nFor a TV with such a slim design, its 4.2.2-channel built-in speaker system delivers solid performance, and audio-related features such as Object Tracking Sound Pro+ make sound effects and dialogue accurately connect with the onscreen action.\nGamers will find lots to love about the QN95F, which supports 4K 165Hz,\nFreeSync Premium Pro, and Samsung\u2019s Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming from apps such as Xbox. This TV\u2019s low 9.5ms input lag, meanwhile, means that gameplay is ultra-responsive.\nThe QN90F is priced higher than much of its mini-LED competition, but with its bright, refined picture and Glare Free screen, it\u2019s a perfect all-around option for watching movies and sports, and for gaming.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a TV for bright rooms: The QN90F has a bright picture, plus its Glare Free tech effectively reduces screen reflections when viewing in bright rooms.\n\u2705 You want a TV that\u2019s great for movies: The QN90F\u2019s powerful contrast and refined local dimming result in pictures with deep and refined shadows when watching movies.\n\u2705 You want a great gaming TV: The QN90F\u2019s HDMI ports with 4K 165 Hz support plus FreeSync Premium and an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag ensure fast and responsive gaming.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want Dolby Vision: The QN90F\u2019s high dynamic range support is limited to the HDR10+, HDR10, and HLG formats.\n\u274c You want the best value TV: Brands like Hisense and TCL also offer mini-LED TVs with high brightness and impressive overall picture quality for less money.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe QN90F\u2019s high brightness levels (I measured 2,086 nits peak brightness in Movie mode) and Glare Free screen allow for pictures to pop even in well-lit rooms. That, plus the TV\u2019s Wide Viewing Angle feature, makes it a perfect TV for sports viewing, and one that also looks great when gaming. Motion handling is also excellent on QN90F, which is another important consideration for sports.\nWhile it's a great TV for sports, the QN90F\u2019s finely controlled local dimming also has benefits for movies, especially 4K ones with HDR. Like other Samsung TVs, the QN90F doesn\u2019t support the Dolby Vision HDR format, but its NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor and 4K AI Upscaling Pro and Auto HDR Remastering Pro features ensure that all manner of standard and 4K high dynamic range pictures look good.\nThe QN90F\u2019s built-in 4.2.2-channel speaker system delivers clear and well-balanced sound and a good sense of \u201cheight\u201d with Dolby Atmos soundtracks. Bass is on the light side \u2013 something to be expected from such a slim TV \u2013 and the soundstage is mostly limited to the screen, but the TV\u2019s Object Tracking Sound Pro+ feature ensures that sound effects accurately track the onscreen action, while Active Voice Amplifier Pro helps dialogue to cut through even frenetic action movie scenes. The QN90F also supports Q-Symphony, a feature that lets you combine its built-in speakers with those in a compatible Samsung soundbar for enhanced sound.\nThe latest version of Samsung\u2019s Tizen smart TV system in the QN90F is the best one yet, with a wide range of new lifestyle-oriented apps and compatibility with the Samsung Art Store, a feature previously only supported by Samsung The Frame TVs. A Live program grid conveniently combines free-to-stream Samsung TV Plus channels with live broadcast TV channels pulled in by the QN90F\u2019s ATSC 3.0 tuner (US only). A new Quick Menu option lets you easily access picture, sound and other settings that can otherwise be buried deep in the QN90F\u2019s menu system, and it also allows for a degree of customization based on the user\u2019s preferences.\nWith an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag, the QN90F provides highly responsive gaming, and its four HDMI 2.1 ports support up to 4K 165Hz for PC gaming. Other key gaming features include FreeSync Premium Pro and HGiG, and Samsung\u2019s Gaming Hub features apps such as Xbox, Nvidia GeForce Now, Boosteroid, and Luna. Compared to its mini-LED TV competition, the QN90F provides a superior gaming experience, and its excellent overall picture quality gives games a cinematic feel.\nThe QN90F costs more than many of its mini-LED competitors, but also delivers more on many fronts, from design to features, picture quality, and gaming performance. Prices for the QN90F series have dropped since the initial release, and Samsung offers regular limited-time discounts, so you should be able to find one at a more reasonable price. The QN90F is also available in smaller 50- and 43-inch screen sizes, which tend to be more affordable.\nSamsung QN90F test results\nThe best TV for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Panasonic\u2019s flagship OLED for 2025, the Z95B, builds on the foundations of last year\u2019s Z95A. At its core is a new Primary RGB Tandem panel, designed to push brightness higher while maintaining rich, nuanced colors. We measured 2,107 nits at peak HDR brightness, but what stands out here is Panasonic\u2019s choice to emphasize accuracy over brightness. The result is images that look beautifully natural and detailed, even if they\u2019re not the brightest on the market. Sound is another area where the Z95B excels. Its upgraded 360 Soundscape Pro system, tuned by Technics, delivers clear, powerful and room-filling audio. With new drivers and a revised layout, this is one of the very few TVs where you can happily skip buying a soundbar. That alone makes it a strong value proposition compared to rivals. Add in a sleek design with a swivel stand, Fire TV smarts, and broad gaming support, and the Z95B is a premium OLED that balances picture, sound and value exceptionally well.\nRead our full Panasonic Z95B review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a top-tier TV for movies\nThe Z95B delivers a rich, accurate and vibrant picture that makes both Blu-rays and streaming content shine.\n\u2705 You\u2019d rather not add extra speakers\nIts built-in 5.1.2 sound system is powerful and spacious enough that you can comfortably skip buying a separate soundbar.\n\u2705 You use Amazon services every day\nWith Fire TV and Alexa built in, this set is tailored for Prime Video watchers and Alexa-powered smart homes.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You mainly watch in bright rooms\nAlthough the TV is bright, it performs best with dimmed lighting and its anti-reflective screen isn\u2019t the most effective against glare.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to adjust picture modes\nThere are plenty of advanced picture and audio settings and in some cases tweaks are needed to get the very best results.\n\u274c You already own a premium Atmos setup\nIf you\u2019ve invested in a soundbar with a subwoofer and rear speakers already, the Z95B\u2019s audio features may be more than you need.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Z95B introduces Panasonic\u2019s latest 'four-stack' OLED panel. By layering red and green pixels between two blue layers, it achieves higher brightness and richer color depth. A built-in cooling system helps sustain peak HDR brightness during demanding scenes and we measured a maximum output of 2,107 nits in testing. However, rather than chasing eye-catching brightness alone, Panasonic is aiming for subtlety and realism here. In modes like Filmmaker, True Cinema, and Cinema, the Z95B delivers refined detail, smooth tonal transitions and lifelike color. It may not outshine its brightest OLED rivals in these settings, but its focus on balance and fidelity results in a truly cinematic image \u2013 great news for movie lovers.\nPanasonic\u2019s 5.1.2-channel 360 Soundscape Pro system has been carried over from the Z95A, but the Z95B upgrades it with better drivers and a better layout. The difference is noticeable with clearer sound, dialogue that\u2019s easy to follow and effects that have a sense of weight and immersion to them. This is one of the best-performing built-in TV audio systems available. A Sound Focus option also ensures voices remain crisp even when you\u2019re watching from an angle, making the experience more consistent across a living room. Crucially, it\u2019s one of the few TVs powerful enough that you can realistically do without a separate soundbar, which boosts its overall value significantly.\nPanasonic turns to Amazon here for its TV interface with Fire TV providing the streaming and smart platform. It\u2019s not as elegant as some competitors\u2019 systems, but it\u2019s responsive, supports all the key apps, and integrates smoothly with Alexa and Prime Video. While the layout leans towards promoting Amazon services, performance is reliable and straightforward. Fire TV\u2019s support for cloud gaming apps is also a nice bonus for players looking beyond traditional console gaming.\nThe Z95B is well-equipped for most modern gaming needs. It supports 4K at 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR, and both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. Input lag is low, and the panel\u2019s color accuracy makes games look vibrant and precise. The main drawback is connectivity because there are only two HDMI 2.1 ports rather than the four offered by some rivals. That will mean juggling connections if you own multiple next-gen consoles, though the TV\u2019s strong built-in sound helps reduce reliance on extra AV gear.\nPanasonic OLEDs have sometimes launched at higher prices than competitors, but the Z95B entered the market at the same level as its premium peers. With audio performance strong enough to rival standalone soundbars, buyers get more for their money here too. So the Z95B isn\u2019t just about picture excellence, it\u2019s a rare TV that delivers equally strong sound and, as a result, excellent overall value.\nPanasonic Z95B test results\nThe best TVs 2025: comparison charts\nHere's a summary of our scores for the key areas we rate TV in \u2013 you can read more about each TV's individual scores in their respective entries in this guide. You can sort the table above by the different categories by clicking the column headers.\nWe measure the objective performance of TVs using as part of our testing process, using these figures to help us make a judgment on the picture quality that we're seeing. The following measurements were all taken by our labs or testers, using professional-level equipment and software. You shouldn't judge a TV based solely on test numbers, but it can be useful to make quick comparisons between them while decided what to buy, so here are the results for all the TVs we rate here together. First is brightness, measured using both HDR and SDR video, in small areas and fullscreen (which makes a big difference).\nHere are our test results for measuring how close the TVs come to supporting 100% of the P3 color range, which used in HDR video. The BT.2020 range is also used in pro video work, but is less important in general use.\nInput lag is the time it from when an image enters the TVs HDMI port, to when it appears on-screen. This is important for gaming, because you want action to happen immediately after you press the button, not with a delay. We measure it using a piece of specialist equipment that rapid-fires a blinking image on the screen, and detects the delay.\nMore TVs to consider\nLG G4: A fantastic TV that delivers phenomenal picture quality and LG's brightest-ever OLED images by a major margin. It's very hard to fault as a TV\u2026 but we prefer the Samsung S95D, which is why that's in this list as the best premium OLED. The S95D has an anti-reflective coating that makes it more versatile, as well as its One Connect box for a sleeker design, and a better built-in sound system. But you should read our five-star LG G4 review because it really is a special TV.\nTCL QM851G: TCL\u2019s top TV offers much of the same picture performance and features as our best mid-range selection, the Hisense U8N. The main reason it didn\u2019t make the cut for our guide is it\u2019s only available in a 65-inch and up screen size, while the U8N has a 55-inch size option. In our TCL QM851G review, we admired its very bright and punchy picture, and also its clean upscaling of lower-resolution sources. It\u2019s also a great TV for sound, with a powerful Onkyo-designed 80-watt, 2.1.2-channel speaker system.\nSamsung Q60D: Samsung's cheapest QLED is a good-looking TV that we said offers \"refined detail\" and \"better than expected contrast\" in our review, given that it doesn't use mini-LED tech. For its low price, it's a rich, enjoyable image\u2026 but the pressure is really on it from the likes of the Roku Pro Series in this list or the Hisense U6N, which both offer a big step up in brightness and contrast for not a lot more money. We liked using this TV, but as we said in our full Samsung Q60D review, \"it faces tough competition from budget mini-LED TVs that offer more gaming features and better pictures for a similar price.\"\nSamsung QN85D: Ah, the poor QN85D. A perfectly lovely TV that simply pales in comparison to the better value and ridiculous brightness of the TCL QM851G and the Hisense U8N when it comes to movies and sports. Having said that, gamers might choose the QN85D over these models, because of its four HDMI 2.1 ports, all equipped for 4K 120Hz gaming with variable refresh rate. So if you've got both next-gen consoles and a soundbar, it gives you the connection flexibility that the TCL and Hisense lack. And it's a great TV in general, as our full Samsung QN85D review explains \u2013 it's just that for non-gaming use, the rival mini-LEDs offer better bang for your buck.\nAmazon Fire TV Omni Mini-LED: Amazon\u2019s top Fire TV model is a relative bargain for what if offers, with good overall picture quality and impressive gaming specs (including 4K 144Hz support) and performance, as we noted in our Amazon Fire TV Omni Mini-LED review. It would be a leading contender to replace the Roku Pro Series TV as the best budget option in this guide if the Roku also didn\u2019t have good picture quality and gaming performance, plus great sound quality and physical design. The cluttered Fire TV interface also takes a backseat to Roku, which is among the cleanest and easiest-to-navigate smart TV interfaces around. All that said, the Omni Mini-LED can be had for an attractive price, especially during big sales events like Amazon\u2019s own Prime Day.\nHisense U9N: Hisense\u2019s flagship mini-LED TV offers even better picture and sound quality than the Hisense U8N, our pick for the best mid-range TV in this guide. Why didn\u2019t the U9N make the cut? Because the Hisense U8N is also a seriously impressive TV, and it can be found for substantially cheaper than the U9N. Even so, in our Hisense U9N review, we noted its superior overall performance compared to the U8N, especially its local dimming and exceptional color gamut coverage, which measured 98.9% for UHD-P3 and 81.5% for BT.2020 in Filmmaker Mode, results that \u201cbest other premium mini-LED TVs we\u2019ve tested.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that the U9N is a great TV; it\u2019s just pricey compared to the also great U8N.\nNew TVs coming in 2025\nMany new TVs were announced a the CES 2025 trade show in Las Vegas, and we fully expect to see some of them added to this guide as they become available to us for review over the course of the year. LG announced the LG C5, the successor to the LG C4 that serves as our current top pick. We have favorably reviewed the LG C5, but have also determined that it offers only an incremental improvement on the C4, which remains our top pick for this guide.\nSamsung announced two new OLED TV series: the S95F, a flagship model that features next-gen Glare Free screen tech that has since been added to this guide, and the mid-range S90F. The company also announced a range of mini-LED and regular LED TVs. These include two 8K series, the QN990F and QN900F, with the former getting the same Glare Free screen as the S95F OLED along with a new 8K wireless One Connect Box for a wireless connection from sources, with support for 8K 120Hz at up to 10 meters. Samsung\u2019s top 4K mini-LED model for 2025 will be the QN90F, which will also get a Glare Free screen plus 165Hz support for gaming, and it will be accompanied by the mid-range QN80F series and entry-level QN70F series mini-LED TVs.\nOther brands showing new TVs at CES include TCL, which announced its QM6K mini-LED Series. The company says that the new TVs will be significantly brighter than last year\u2019s models and feature 144Hz refresh rate along with 288Hz VRR support for gaming. Hisense announced the 116\u201d TriChroma LED TV, a high-end model with a 116-inch screen size and a new RGB mini-LED backlight that\u2019s said to be capable of 10,000 nits peak brightness. Both TCL and Hisense will be announcing additional TV series as we get deeper into 2025.\nFinally, Panasonic unveiled a new Z95B OLED TV with a 'Primary RGB Tandem Panel\u2019 that uses similar tech as the new LG G5 OLED. Unlike last year\u2019s Z95A, which was only available in a 65-inch size, it will be sold in 55-, 65- and 77-inch sizes and features a re-designed sound system tuned by Panasonic\u2019s sister brand Technics. The Z95B has since been added to this guide as a replacement for the Panasonic Z95A.\nThe best TV brands 2025\nThe best TV brand landscape has shifted somewhat over the past few years, with top brands shifting places to a degree on the power rankings chart, and upstart brands such as Hisense and TCL gaining traction. Along with these, we saw the re-introduction of Panasonic to the US TV market in 2024, along with new TV brands like Roku and Amazon putting out increasingly higher-quality sets. What follows is a summary of the various TV brands ordered according to their performance in TechRadar\u2019s TV tests.\nJudged by its overall performance in TechRadar\u2019s recent TV reviews, Samsung is the leading TV brand, scoring two each 5-star, 4.5-star, and 4-star overall ratings in reviews we\u2019ve conducted over the past year. We rate Samsung TVs highly for their picture quality, though we regularly cite the lack of Dolby Vision HDR support as a downside. Samsung TVs are also the strongest when it comes to gaming performance and features, and each yearly iteration introduces new cutting-edge design innovations.\nLG scored one 5-star, two 4.5-star, and one 4-star overall ratings in our TV reviews last year, trailing directly behind Samsung. Like Samsung TVs, LG TVs earn strong praise for picture quality and features in our reviews, and they also provide one of the best smart TV platforms in webOS. Gaming performance and features are also regularly cited in our LG TV reviews, though the company lags behind competitors when it comes to mini-LED TV development, leaning instead on OLED for its top TV brand status.\nSony shifted its focus from OLED to mini-LED tech for its flagship TVs last year, managing to earn one five-star and two 4.5-star overall ratings in our reviews. The company\u2019s flagship TVs are the ones that provide the best picture quality, though they are generally pricier than equivalent flagship models from Samsung and LG. Sony TVs also provide excellent built-in sound quality, though they lag behind the competition when it comes to gaming features and performance despite providing PS5-centric settings.\nHisense and TCL fit into the middle of our overall TV brand rankings, with Hisense edging out TCL with two 4.5-star and two 4-star overall ratings in our reviews last year. Both brands provide a range of high-value TVs with the top models providing excellent overall picture quality and sound quality. Performance tends to drop as you move down the range for each respective brand, however, and the gaming features on their TVs aren\u2019t as extensive as what you\u2019ll get from Samsung and LG.\nLast but not necessarily least, Roku and Amazon both made good showings in our recent reviews, with Roku scoring one 4.5-star and Amazon one 4-star overall rating. Both of these were for the company\u2019s first mini-LED TVs, which offer impressive picture quality at a budget price. We generally praise Roku TVs for their excellent smart TV interface, which is easy on the eyes and intuitive to navigate, while Amazon Fire TVs earn marks for good overall performance and high value.\nHow to choose the best TV for you\nThere are lots of complicated terms you'll see when buying a new TV, including in this guide \u2013 so to start our generlized buying advice, here's a glossary of the big terms you'll see often.\n120Hz/144Hz: This is the \u2018refresh rate\u2019 of the TV, meaning how many image frames it can show each second. 120Hz means 120 frames per second maximum. Classified as high frame rate (HFR), 120Hz is ideal for next-gen gaming consoles such as PS5 and Xbox Series X, and can also benefit sports viewing. While consoles are capped at 120Hz, some TVs can support 144Hz for PC gaming.\n4K: Also known as Ultra HD (UHD), a 4K image consists of roughly 4,000 horizontal pixels \u2013 3,840 in the UHD standard specs used by streamers and 4K Blu-ray, to be precise \u2013 by 2,160 vertical pixels, which is four times the amount found in Full HD TVs. Most streaming services now support 4K as do most 43-inches and larger TVs.\nALLM (auto low latency mode): A feature primarily used for gaming where a TV will switch to the optimal game picture mode/settings when it detects a connected gaming console.\nATSC 3.0: Also known as \u201cNextGen TV,\u201d it is a broadcast TV standard created by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) that supports 4K resolution, high dynamic range, and immersive audio formats such as Dolby Atmos. ATSC is used by broadcast TV stations in the US, and it requires a TV with an ATSC 3.0-compatible tuner.\nARC: Audio Return Channel. This feature allows for audio signals to be sent from a TV to an HDMI ARC-supported device such as a soundbar or AV receiver via an HDMI connection.\nBacklight: The light source that sits behind the display panel in an LED-based TV. Various backlight types include edge-lit, direct, and full-array.\nColor gamut: The range of colors that can be displayed by a device within a particular color space such as REC.709, BT.2020 and UHDA-P3. Supporting a wider color gamut means the TV should be able show images closer to the original material.\nDirect backlight: A type of backlight that sits directly behind a TV\u2019s panel. Direct backlights can offer better dimming control and black uniformity (the ability to display black tones evenly across a screen) than edge-lit backlights\nDolby Vision: A High Dynamic Range (HDR) format that\u2019s used to dynamically optimize image contrast on a scene-by-scene or frame-by-frame basis . Dolby Vision is widely used in movie theaters, 4K Blu-ray releases, streaming services and video games.\nDolby Atmos: A 3D sound format that incorporates height channels to create a dome-like immersive effect. Dedicated speakers produce the most authentic Atmos sound, though some soundbars and built-in TV speakers can produce good \u2018virtual\u2019 Atmos sound as well.\neARC: Enhanced Audio Return Channel. An improved version of HDMI ARC that allows for transmission of higher-quality, uncompressed Dolby and DTS audio formats over HDMI from a TV.\nFull Array Backlight: An advanced backlight design that improves local dimming by partitioning the backlight into small zones, each of which can have their light levels controlled individually. This results in better contrast, higher brightness and reduced backlight blooming effects.\nHDMI: A cable standard used to transmit audio and video from a source to a display device. It stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface, and is the standard connector for TVs now.\nHDMI 2.1: The latest HDMI version, and one that allows for transmission of higher-quality, uncompressed Dolby and DTS audio formats, 8K video, and higher video frame rates such as 4K at 120Hz for gaming.\nHDR: High Dynamic Range. A video format that allows for images with improved brightness, contrast and color detail. Most newer TVs support some format of HDR, which is used for video games, 4K Blu-ray discs and streaming services.\nHDR10: A common, widely used HDR format on 4K Blu-ray players, game consoles, TVs and streaming services.Basically any TV device with HDR will support this\nHDR10+: A less commonly supported HDR format with similar capabilities as Dolby Vision. HDR10+ is supported by TVs from Samsung, Panasonic, TCL, and Hisense, and is used by streaming services such as Prime Video.\nHLG: Hybrid-Log Gamma. A HDR format developed by the BBC and NHK broadcasting services that was designed to simultaneously transmit both SDR and HDR signals. It is used for live HDR broadcasting, and is supported on effectively every TV.\nInput lag: The time delay between a video or audio signal being sent and actioned by a relevant device. In the case of TVs, it refers to the time between when the TV receives an image from, say, a games console, and when that image is shown on-screen. Input lag is measured in milliseconds (ms), with the lower the number the better. This specification particularly is useful in gaming, where a measurement below 15ms is considered optimal.\nLocal Dimming: LED and mini-LED TVs with full array backlights may dim darker areas on the screen and accentuate brighter areas, resulting in better contrast by using this \u2018localized\u2019 dimming.\nMini-LED: A backlight tech that uses small, almost microscopic LEDs for more efficient and improved dimming and lighting performance over regular LED backlights.\nNits (brightness): A unit of measurement used to evaluate brightness. The peak brightness of LED TVs is typically around 500 nits, QLED TVs roughly 1,000 nits, OLED TVs between 600 and 1500 nits, and mini-LED TVs may hit 2,000-plus nits.\nNeo QLED: Samsung\u2019s name for its range of mini-LED TVs, which combine a QLED display panel with a mini-LED backlight.\nOLED: Organic Light Emitting Diode. A type of display panel that contains self-emitting pixels that generate their own light, eliminating the need for a backlight. OLED TVs typically have deeper, more accurate black levels than other TV types, because they can dim the light from each pixel individually\nQLED: Quantum Light Emitting Diode. An LED display panel with a coating of \u2018nanocrystals\u2019 that can achieve higher brightness and brighter, more vivid colors than the ones used in standard LED TVs.\nSDR: Standard Dynamic Range. A video production and display standard with more limited brightness, contrast and color gamut coverage compared to HDR. Anything from before the HDR era can be considered SDR.\nVRR (variable refresh rate): A tech used primarily in gaming where the display will adjust its frame rate to match the rate of the source device, such as a console or PC, to avoid judder and screen-tearing effects. VRR is particularly useful during high frame rate gaming.\nHow do I choose the best TV for me?\nThere are tons of things you could consider when buying a new TV, but not everyone needs to get stuck in the technological weeds. Here's the advice our editors tend to give the (many) people who ask this of them in real life.\nFirst, set your budget and your size. Choose a maximum amount you're willing to spend, and the size of TV you want, and then narrow your search to only models that fit both of those criteria. You will find that already you're down to looking at only a handful of options, making it much easier to get a grip on things. If you have quite a high budget, set yourself a minimum budget too to help narrow things \u2013 maybe 30% below your maximum budget.\nWhen considering the size of the TV, think about where you'll be installing it; it can make all the difference if you're using one of the best TV wall mounts to mount your TV, or just placing it on a stand, as the same TV can look different on both these places.\nSo now you'll need to make a few further decisions. If you're looking at the mid-range or premium end of things, do you want an OLED TV or an LED/mini-LED TV? In sizes 55 inches and up, LED TVs tend to be brighter than OLEDs, and so are great for watching sports or TV during the day in bright rooms. But for movie nights, OLED TVs are the best, thanks to their unrivaled contrast \u2013 they just don't go as bright as LED TVs unless you get the most expensive models.\nIf you're buying a mid-range set, you'll need to decide if you need a 120Hz screen or not. This is great for gamers (especially those with a PS5 or Xbox Series X), and also good for movies because it can show more natural motion. But if you want to save cash, getting a 60Hz TV might be a better idea, because 120Hz TVs always cost more.\nAnd then, spare a thought to sound. Most of today's thin TVs have weak built-in sound. If you don't mind buying one of the best soundbars too (or if you already have one), then don't worry about this. But if you don't want extra boxes in your setup, then focus on the TVs we've recommended where we mention the audio is stronger. Sadly, it tends to be higher-end sets that do this better \u2013 but even then, not all are created equal. Sony and Samsung are usually strong for audio, though, so are a good place to start.\nWhich TV is the best quality?\nThat depends on how you define quality. We define it as the ultimate mix of picture quality, features, design and price \u2013 when recommending the TV that's best for most people at any given price, that's what we're looking for. And that's why the Samsung S90C is at the top of our list \u2013 some TVs do individual things better, but nothing else does so much stuff so well, for the same kind of price (thanks to price cuts, because it's a TV from 2023).\nThe best premium OLED on the market for us is the Samsung S95D, which is an extremely high-end option, but is worth every penny when you see the results from its super-bright screen combined with its amazing anti-reflection panel.\nWhich brand is best for TVs in 2025?\nNo one brand does TVs better than the others, but there are definitely some TV makers that excel in certain areas more than their rivals.\nSome of the best brands on our list are Hisense, LG, Samsung, Sony, and TCL. They all tend to be the top-performing brands at the premium end, though all bring out a wide range of models each year.\nLG also makes excellent OLED TVs \u2013 in fact, LG Display makes the OLED panels for most other brands. We like that LG offers a wide range of TVs, including different budgets and sizes \u2013 the LG C4 goes from 42 inches all the way up to 83 inches and delivers on every front, and that's why it's at the top this list. LG's webOS is one of our favorite smart TV platforms, and is an easy to use operating system that feels intuitive. LG's LED TVs aren't great value, though, again compared to Hisense and TCL.\nWith steps into the QD-OLED world, Samsung has established itself as a real contender for best OLED TVs, with the also impressive Samsung S95D offering incredible picture quality and performance. There are also Samsung's dynamic mini-LEDs available that will suit most people with bright environments, though Hisense and TCL have these models beaten for sheer value in 2025.\nSony is another major player in the TV space. Its screens boast stunning picture quality and build quality. Although, like other brands in this list, there's a wide range across the board. Sony's TVs tend to cost a premium compared to the other brands here for the same kind of features, except Sony's TVs contain some of the best built-in sound in the business, so you do get something extra for that price.\nHisense and TCL are the two makers who've really crashed the party, producing mini-LED TVs for unbelievably good prices that deliver astounding brightness and impressive contrast, with good features. They both use Google TV as their smart platform, which makes them fairly easy to use and ensures all the key streaming services are there.\nWhich is better OLED or QLED?\nThis is one of the biggest and more contentious TV tech questions of the moment. Luckily we've covered all of the details in our OLED vs QLED guide.\nHowever, if you're looking for a summary we'd say that QLED is a great option for brightness if you'll watch in bright, sunlit conditions; whereas OLED TVs offer better viewing angles and superior contrast for gorgeous movie-like images, as long as you can control the room lighting.\nIs 4K better than OLED?\nLuckily, you don't need to decide whether to go with OLED or 4K \u2013 you can have both! 4K refers to the resolution (ie, the number of pixels on the screen), while OLED refers to the panel technology (ie, what the pixels are made from).\nSo you can have 4K screens that are OLED (almost all of them are, apart from some pricey 8K OLED TVs), and you can have 4K screens that are QLED, mini-LED or other tech.\nIs LG better than Samsung?\nBoth LG and Samsung are excellent TV brands and you can't really go wrong with either when it comes to OLED, but it's a different matter outside of that.\nLG's LED TVs are notably a weaker proposition than Samsung's, so if you're thinking of going for a budget TV or a mini-LED model, Samsung is the better bet of these two.\nWhen it comes to OLED TVs, we rate Samsung's S95D marginally ahead of the LG G4 equivalent thanks to its anti-reflection screen, but if you mostly watch in controlled lighting, the LG G4 is just as good.\nWe love the LG C4's versatility, coming in many different sizes and with every gaming feature you could want \u2013 it's a great mid-range model. But at the moment, we recommend the Samsung S90C over it because they're about the same for picture quality and key features, but the Samsung TV is a year older, and so has received many more price drops \u2013 it's better value.\nHow we test the best TVs\nEach TechRadar TV review involves a series of objective tests made using specialized test equipment. These are combined with extensive subjective evaluation using both test patterns and real-world sources such as 4K Blu-ray, streamed content, and broadcast TV.\nFor our objective tests, we measure a TV\u2019s peak and fullscreen brightness levels, along with its HDR color gamut coverage. We also measure color and grayscale accuracy, as well as input lag for gaming.\nAfter determining a TV\u2019s most accurate picture preset using objective tests, our subjective evaluation will be performed with that preset active to make a general assessment of picture quality, taking into account factors such as contrast, black level, screen uniformity, color, detail, and more. We also assess sound quality, features, design, smart TV and menus, gaming features and performance, and value, with individual scores for each section contributing to an overall rating.\nYou can get a fully detailed overview of our process in How we test TVs at TechRadar.\nLatest updates to our guide to the best TVs\nAugust 27, 2025\nReplaced the Panasonic Z95A with the newer Panasonic Z95B as our 'Best for sound' top choice based on our recent testing.\nJuly 29, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung S95D with the Samsung S95F, a new model with an improved Glare Free screen, as 'Best OLED for bright rooms' option.\nJuly 1, 2025\nReplaced Samsung QN90D with newer model, Samsung QN90F, as 'Best TV for sports' option.\nRead more updates\nMay 28, 2025\nReplaced Hisense U8N with a newer model, the Hisense U8QG, as 'Best mid-range' option.\nApril 29, 2025\nReplaced Sony Bravia 8 with Panasonic Z95A OLED as 'Best for sound.'\nApril 1, 2025\nAdded Quick List for easier guide navigation.\nMarch 12, 2025\nAdded the Amazon Fire TV Omni Mini-LED and Hisense U9N to 'Also consider' section.\nFebruary 14, 2025\nAdded 'Best TV brands' section with ranked assessments of TV brands TechRadar has reviewed over the past year.\nJanuary 15, 2025\nAdded 'New TVs coming in 2025' section with details on new TV models announced at the CES 2025 tradeshow.\nDecember 24, 2024\nRemoved the Samsung S90C due to falling stock levels.

      "text": "I listened to spatial audio on a 7.4.4-channel Focal speaker system, and now I need to up my Dolby Atmos music game\nFrench speaker manufacturer Focal is demonstrating a range of speaker setups and headphones at the Audio Advice Live show in Raleigh, NC, but the demo I was most excited to catch was its Utopia Cinema system.\nFocal\u2019s 7.4.4-channel home theater setup consists of five Cinema LCR and two Focal 1000 IWLCR speakers, four Cinema Sub subwoofers, two IWSUB in-wall subwoofers, and four ICLCR5 in-ceiling Atmos speakers, all driven by a Focal Astral 16 audio processor and multiple Naim CI-NAP amps.\nThe system costs around $150,000 alone, with the Sony VPL-GTZ30 projector, 200-inch Stewart Filmscreen screen, and Kaleidescape movie player that Focal also used for its demo adding another 100K or so to the bill of sale.\nFocal screened several movie clips, including one of my reference go-tos for TV testing, the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die, and the image from the 10,000-lumen Sony professional projector looked fantastically bright even on the enormous screen.\nThe sound was equally impressive, with the explosion when Bond makes an ill-advised visit to former flame Vesper Lynd\u2019s gravesite conveyed with a level of impact and low-end rumble that one would expect to hear from six huge subs with dual 13-inch woofers.\nThe sweet sounds of Dolby Atmos music\nAs good as the Bond clip looked and sounded (and I have screened it innumerable times, so I know what to expect), what really grabbed my attention in Focal\u2019s demo was the Dolby Atmos music selections.\nTwo songs were played, with the first being Elton John\u2019s Rocket Man, from the 1972 album Honky Ch\u00e2teau. John\u2019s piano had a solid yet wonderfully wide presentation that remained locked up front, while the soaring lead guitar and backing vocals spread above and around me in a manner that I found warm and engaging instead of gimmicky.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe next clip was a spatial audio remix of the electronic track On My Knees by R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol (those umlauts!) done by Techno Dad, a well-known YouTuber and friend of Focal. This was Atmos music to the max, with the trajectory of the bass-heavy, spatially adventurous mix graphically depicted in an onscreen display. Once again, I found myself utterly engaged, as well as curious to hear more demo-worthy Atmos music mixes, and on the best possible system.\nAfter a year or so settling for the best soundbars for music listening, it looks like I\u2019m going to have to reinstall my big AV rig when I get home. Sadly, I\u2019ll be limited to only one subwoofer, not six, but I\u2019ll manage to make do.\nYou might also like\nAl Griffin has been writing about and reviewing A/V tech since the days LaserDiscs roamed the earth, and was previously the editor of Sound & Vision magazine.\nWhen not reviewing the latest and greatest gear or watching movies at home, he can usually be found out and about on a bike.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "The best Dolby Atmos soundbars: home theater upgrades for all budgets\nDolby Atmos soundbars are the simple way to home theater paradise, no matter how big your room is\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbars allow you to hear your favorite movies and TV shows in a way that\u2019s more immersive and natural. That's because Dolby Atmos is a surround sound audio format that isolates audio to individual objects \u2013 someone screaming, a dog barking, a helicopter overhead \u2013 that can be mapped in 3D space, rather than being attached to a particular speaker in a setup.\nSo if you can see a helicopter on screen flying above your head, it\u2019ll sound as if it\u2019s flying over your head, too. Essentially, sound is placed where it naturally would be based on what you\u2019re watching on the screen, with more precision and effectiveness than regular surround sound.\nYou won\u2019t get the same uncompromised presentation of Dolby Atmos soundtracks that the best AV receivers deliver when paired with a surround sound speaker system, but those setups take up a lot of space and can be expensive. That\u2019s where the best soundbars show their advantage, and the best Dolby Atmos soundbars are the easy way to deliver a powerful home theater experience.\nThe quick list\nIn a hurry but need to find the best Dolby Atmos soundbar for you? Take a look at our quick list below which covers a soundbar that will suit every budget and situation. You can still check out more detailed reviews of each soundbar below.\nBest overall\nBest Dolby Atmos soundbar for most people\nThe Q800D is excellent value overall.

When set vertically, it takes on a slimmer profile, making it an ideal match for a sleek, wall-mounted TV.\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, and has over a decade of experience in tech publishing. He has been writing about the latest TVs and soundbars since 2017. CES 2024 has been and gone, which gave us a glimpse of all the new soundbars on the horizon. Matt was most impressed by the Samsung HW-Q990D, which has since been added to our guide.\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbars you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbar for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best value soundbar: The Q800D carries a mid-range price, but delivers premium audio performance and features.\n\u2705 You want effective Atmos sound: The Q800D's sound is powerful and dynamic, but its Atmos presentation impresses even more.\n\u274c You want 4K 120Hz passthrough: If you have a next-gen console such as a PS5, you'll have to look at other soundbars for 4K 120Hz passthrough.\n\u274c You want an aesthetically appealing soundbar: The Q800D has a chunky, plain angular look \u2013 it won't be winning any design awards.\nEffective Dolby Atmos and DTS:X from a soundbar doesn't have to be expensive. This is demonstrated in no better way than by the Samsung HW-Q800D. Along with immersive Atmos effects, the Q800D delivers punchy, impressive sound and a great stock of features, all for an affordable price.\nIn our review, we complimented the Samsung HW-Q800D on its powerful bass and vocal clarity. We were also pleased with its engaging and accurate mapping of sound to characters and action on screen. But it was the HW-Q800D's surround sound that impressed most. As we said in our review, \"Despite the absence of rear channels, this soundbar still asserts a striking spatial impression\". For the mid-range price you pay, we really couldn't find fault with the Q800D, barring the fact that it isn't much different from its HW-Q800C predecessor \u2013 in itself not a bad thing.\nFeatures-wise, the HW-Q800D comes with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support for music playback as well as Samsung's Q Symphony, which works with Samsung TVs from 2022 onwards, utilizing the TV's built-in speakers to create an even fuller sound. One thing missing here is 4K 120Hz passthrough on its HDMI ports for gaming, with only 4K 60Hz available.\nThe Q800D's only real let-down is its somewhat chunky, angular design. While soundbars generally aren't appealing to look at, the Q800D is particularly plain. But, otherwise, it carries price vs performance to near perfection and is easily the best Dolby Atmos soundbar for most people.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q800D review\nThe best budget Dolby Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want good Dolby Atmos on a budget: The Sony HT-S2000's Atmos reproduction is impressive for a comapct, all-in-one bar.\n\u2705 You want clear speech: The HT-S2000's dialogue is crystal clear and will beat a lot of TV's built-in speakers.\n\u274c You want Wi-Fi for music streaming: The Sony HT-S2000 only supports Bluetooth for music playback and streaming.\n\u274c You want the most immersive soundbar: While its virtual processing of Atmos is great, soundbars such as the Samsung HW-Q990D and Hisense AX5125H will deliver a more 'real' Atmos sound with their multiple units.\nSony absolutely nailed the brief of delivering big sound from a compact form. Its budget soundbar, the HT-S2000, strikes the perfect balance of giving your TV's audio a big boost in immersive audio power, while not taking up too much valuable screen space.\nDuring our testing, we said that we were blown away by its \"impressive level of immersion given its basic speaker array and compact form factor \u2013 much of this is owed to Sony\u2019s proprietary processing\". Apart from the incredibly effective immersive audio processing power, the clear dialogue and defined bass were another two highlights about the sound quality from our review.\nIt's not all completely praises, though. The trade-off for its reasonably affordable price tag is that your wireless streaming connectivity options are limited to Bluetooth 5.2, there's also only one HDMI port and optical digital input, but you can still pair the HT-S2000 with other Sony speakers and subwoofers.\nBased on previous sales, we have seen the Sony HT-S2000 drop to $349 in the US and \u00a3299 in the UK from its initial $499 and \u00a3449 respective prices so it is worth looking out for a deal if you do manage to catch one for this Sonos Beam (Gen 2) (at #9 in this list) alternative.\nRead our full Sony HT-S2000 review.\nThe best budget soundbar for Dolby Atmos surround\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want 'real' Dolby Atmos for cheap: With a subwoofer and two rear speakers (and even height channels), the AX5125H delivers an immersive, Atmos sound for a very affordable price.\n\u2705 You want clarity and power: The AX5125H may be cheap, but its sound is engaging and powerful enough that it suggests a much more premium soundbar.\n\u274c You want the best soundbar for music: Limited to Bluetooth quality, the AX5125H isn't the best soundbar for music.\n\u274c You want a more customizable soundbar: The AX5125H doesn't have an app for EQ adjustments, only simple bass and treble buttons.\nDolby Atmos soundbars in the budget range are typically single-unit solutions that deliver Atmos height effects and surround sound using virtual processing. The Hisense AX5125H breaks with that tradition by using real upfiring speakers on its main soundbar, along with wireless surround speakers and a subwoofer for an incredibly low $350 / \u00a3350 / AU$450 price.\nHisense\u2019s budget 5.1.2-channel system surprised us when we reviewed it with its \u201ceffective Dolby Atmos delivery\u201d and surprisingly wide soundstage, which gave all aspects of the soundtrack room to breathe.\u201d Dialogue, too, was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d in our assessment of the AX5125H system\u2019s sound quality. If there was one thing that disappointed us, it was the performance of the surround speakers, which could get overwhelmed when faced with aggressive soundtrack mixes, but overall the system\u2019s feisty sound wowed us for the price.\nFor a $350 soundbar system, you wouldn\u2019t expect premium build quality, and that\u2019s an area where the Hisense falls short. But while its looks skew toward basic and bland, it has a front-panel alphanumeric display to provide visual feedback when making adjustments to the system using the supplied remote control \u2013 a rare feature at this price, and a valuable one.\nWith only Bluetooth onboard for wireless music streaming, the Hisense AX5125H isn\u2019t the last word in sound quality with music, but we still found music listening to be an enjoyable experience, and it could be played loud without straining the system. You\u2019ll need to pay plenty more to get a 5.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system that performs better than this Hisense package, and for many people, we think that Hisense\u2019s budget soundbar will more than suffice.\nRead our full Hisense AX5125H review\nThe best mid-range Dolby Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a solid soundbar for your home theater: The Q700C has a good amount of punch and decent enough Atmos effects.\n\u2705 You have a compatible Samsung TV: The Q700C comes with Q Symphony built-in \u2013 pair it with a Samsung TV from 2022 onwards and get more sound for your money.\n\u274c You can afford the Samsung HW-Q800D: While the Q700C's sound is good overall, the step-up Q800D is much better and often only a fraction more in price.\n\u274c You want the most accurate Atmos presentation: The Q700C does a decent job with Atmos, but soundbars like the Hisense AX5125H and Samsung Q800D are better.\nSamsung has priced its HW-Q700C smack bang in the middle of the Dolby Atmos soundbar market so if your budget is exactly $549.99 / \u00a3599 / AU$899, then we have the ideal bar and subwoofer combination for you. Of course, it has to be said if you can spend just a little more, you can unlock even more powerful audio quality with the Samsung HW-Q800D at #1 in this list.\nThe HW-Q700's soundstage still feels incredibly wide thanks to its 3.1.2 channels of sound, coming from a center, two wide-range tweeters, two dedicated upward firing drivers and a wireless 6.5-inch subwoofer. Of course, without the rear speakers that the flagship HW-Q990C has at #4 in this list, it doesn't quite match it's audio prowess but it's less than half the price after all.\nYou're still getting top quality sound with the HW-Q700C. Like we wrote in our review: \"The Samsung HW-Q700C soundbar did indeed fill my room with sound that evidently had greater height, and during Avengers: Endgame in the main, epic battle at the end, sounds of various spaceships and otherworldly beasts flying in from the sides of the screen did sound as they had come from my side or behind me.\"\nIt comes with a varied list of features, too, including a range of connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2 and Tidal Connect, as well as support for hi-res sound format such as FLAC, AAC, ALAC, WAV, WMA, and MP3. Considering how well-equipped the HW-Q700C is, it really is surprising to see it priced where it is, as it offers incredibly, good value.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q700C review.\nThe best premium Dolby Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best soundbar for Dolby Atmos: With 11.1.4 channels, the Q990D's sound is rich, powerful and immersive with a real sense of surround that no other soundbar can capture as well.\n\u2705 You want a soundbar for gaming: The Q990D has 4K, 120Hz passthrough, VRR and an ultra-low 9.9ms input lag \u2013 all perfect for next-gen consoles.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Brilliance does unfortunately come at a price as the Q990D is one of the most expensive soundbars on this list\n\u274c You want the clearest display: The mesh grille of the Q990D can obscure the front LED display, sometimes making it hard to read.\nThe Samsung HW-Q990D is the best Dolby Atmos soundbar package available. Following its predecessor, the Samsung HW-Q990C, it provides 16 'real' audio channels across 22 speakers for a powerful, immersive and controlled Atmos experience.\nFirst and foremost, the Q990D has excellent sound quality, and it provides a fantastic surround experience without all the boxes and wires of a full home theater system. Bass is punchy and meaty but also has a refined touch, with other elements of the Q990D's sound allowed room to breathe.\nThe Q990D has many of the same features as the Q990C such as Tidal and Spotify Connect and Dolby Atmos music streaming, but adds 4K 120Hz pass-through on its HDMI ports. the upside to that feature is that gamers can use the Q990D to get a faster refresh rate when their PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles are connected to the soundbar.\nAdmittedly, this soundbar package is pricey. But, for those who can stretch their budget and are looking for a neater solution to a full home theater setup, the Q990D offers best-in-class audio quality and immersion.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q990D review\nThe best compact Dolby Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a real Atmos sound from a single soundbar: The Bose Smart Soundbar has up-firing channels to deliver an authentic Atmos sound.\n\u2705 You want an soundbar that's expandable: Like a few soundbars on this list, the Bose can have additional rear speakers and a subwoofer added in and it can also be used with Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds for surround sound.\n\u274c You like your soundbar bassy: The Bose Smart Soundbar has a good sound profile, but the bass in the soundbar itself is a little lacking - the optional subwoofer may be needed for some.\n\u274c You want to connect to multiple HDMI sources: The Smart Soundbar only carries one HDMI port, the eARC for connection to the TV.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a compact soundbar that provides \u201creal\u201d Dolby Atmos using upfiring speakers, the Bose Smart Soundbar is a perfect choice. At 27 inches wide by 2 inches high and 4 inches deep, the Smart Soundbar is designed to pair with smaller TVs, but its expansive sound will also make it a good match for bigger screens, especially when Bose\u2019s proprietary TrueSpace processing is switched on.\nFeatures include built-in Wi-Fi with both AirPlay 2 and Chromecast support. A unique Smart Soundbar offering is Personal Surround Sound, which lets you use Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds to get surround sound without having to set up extra speakers. Another surround sound option is to add Bose wireless rear speakers and a subwoofer, an upgrade that the Smart Soundbar supports.\nIn our review, we remarked that dialogue was\u201cconsistently intelligible,\u201d and appreciated the Bose app\u2019s level and EQ controls, which allowed for dialogue to be boosted on an as-needed basis. Given the Smart Soundbar\u2019s compact design, bass is necessarily limited, but Dolby Atmos soundtracks benefit from an authentic sense of height that the virtual processing used by some other affordable Atmos soundbars can\u2019t match.\nWith its under $500 / \u00a3500 / AU$700 price, the Bose Smart Soundbar is a very good value. One of our few complaints with it was the lack of multiple HDMI ports for connecting additional sources, but that\u2019s a feature you generally have to pay quite a bit more for.\nTo save some money on Bose products, check out our Bose voucher codes.\nRead our full Bose Smart Soundbar review\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbar for gamers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want gaming features: The sony HT-A7000 features two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you can connect a PS5 or Xbox Series X to it.\n\u2705 You want good vocal clarity: The HT-A7000's biggest strength is in its extremely clear dialogue presentation.\n\u274c You want the best Atmos for a single soundbar: The HT-A7000's height channels struggle to give the same surround sound immersion you'd get from soundbars with speakers.\n\u274c You're on a budget: The Sony HT-A7000 is significantly pricier than a lot of the soundbar on this list, even the Samsung HW-Q990D system is cheaper.\nThe Sony HT-A7000 soundbar may have a massive sticker price, but it promises a long shelf life thanks to its two HDMI 2.1 ports and support for all of the major spatial audio formats.\nAt this price we wish it came with the surround and subwoofer units, but those with incredibly deep pockets can tack those on for a few hundred more later down the line.\nWhat helps make the price tag here feel a little more justified is the fact that the HT-A7000 comes with upfiring drivers. What that means is it delivers true and impressive Dolby Atmos, although we did feel the height channels could be a little more convincing during our testing.\nIn terms of musicality, though, the HT-A7000 is a very talented soundbar, with excellent stereo imaging and a really room-filling sound \u2014 especially if you take advantage of its support for Sony's 360 Reality Audio.\nConnectivity is very good, too. The soundbar supports HDMI, of course, but it also has 3.5mm auxiliary, Bluetooth audio, USB devices, Spotify, Chromecast, Amazon Alexa and 360 Reality Audio via Deezer, Tidal and Amazon Music. That's a very wide selection of sources, giving you lots of flexibility in terms of what you want to connect.\nRead our full Sony HT-A7000 Dolby Atmos soundbar review\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbar for flexibility\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a versatile soundbar: The JBL Bar 1300X has immersive Atmos sound and rechargeable and detachable rear speakers, which give a lot of location options.\n\u2705 You want a lot of connection options: The Bar 1300X comes with four HDMI ports for connection with multiple devices.\n\u274c You don't want to spend big: The Bar 1300X is a pricey soundbar that will be out of reach for a lot of budgets.\n\u274c You want the best soundbar for gaming: The Bar 1300X has a lot of HDMI ports, but none of them have 4K, 120Hz passthrough for gaming.\nWe don't often award a soundbar five out of five stars in our reviews, but the JBL Bar 1300X hands-down deserves it. We enjoyed testing this soundbar, finding it worthy of praise for its ability to deliver impressive levels of immersion whether we were listening to music or it was pumping out movie soundtracks, as well as its innovative design.\nThe JBL Bar 1300X is a Dolby Atmos soundbar that would suit anyone looking for a powerful and immersive option on par with the visceral excitement that the best home theater systems effortlessly deliver, while also being relatively easy to setup and, crucially, not becoming a burden in your home.\nThis soundbar offers multiple HDMI inputs, so you can connect a stack of sources, and the system\u2019s rechargeable rear speakers can also be used as portable Bluetooth speakers \u2013 design flex that heightens the Bar 1300X's overall value.\nThe JBL Bar 1300X may not take up too much space, but it is designed to fill larger rooms with sound so we wouldn't recommend it if you only have a small space. It's also not the best soundbar for serious gamers. Multiple HDMI ports are here, but none of them have 4K 120Hz pass-through to support that resolution and frame rate when playing games on PS5 or Xbox Series X.\nRead our full JBL Bar 1300X review\nThe best Sonos Dolby Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a fantastic all-in-one box solution: The Sonos Arc Ultra delivers punchy and dynamic performance for both music and movies in a single unit.\n\u2705 You want versatility from your soundbar: The Arc Ultra can be a lone unit, part of a wider Sonos multi-room system, and it can be expanded with extra speakers.\n\u274c You want DTS/DTS:X: The Sonos Arc Ultra supports Dolby Atmos, but home theater users with DTS:X media will miss out as it is unsupported.\n\u274c You have space for a multi-box system: If you've got the room for a full surround sound system such as the Samsung HW-Q990D, this will give you the most authentic surround sound.\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra expands on its predecessor, the Sonos Arc, and delivers a fuller, punchier and more dynamic sound. Its sleeker design also makes it an attractive all-in-one Dolby Atmos soundbar.\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra delivers superb performance overall, offering a \"fulsome balance, exciting sound and clear speech,\" as we said in our Sonos Arc Ultra review. We were impressed by how improved speech was over the original Arc and how much fuller the bass was. While Dolby Atmos effects aren't completely immersive, there's excellent height and width to the Arc Ultra's sound and we also found that it was good for music. DTS:X fans will need to look elsewhere, though, as that format is not supported on the Arc Ultra.\nThe Arc Ultra's design change compared to the original Arc reduces its overall volume size by 18%. It's wider than the Sonos Arc, but shorter, and will suit more TVs. It's also one of the more visually appealing soundbars on the market thanks to its curved, modern design, which will blend in with more rooms.\nThe Arc Ultra sits at $999 / \u00a3999, so it's not the cheapest soundbar, but it delivers a premium performance to match its price tag. We think this is one of the best soundbars at this price range and it's easily Sonos' best model.\nRead our full Sonos Arc Ultra review\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbar for-wall-mounting\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a soundbar that adapts to your setup: Designed to reconfigure its output depending on how it's positioned, offering great flexibility without compromising performance.\n\u2705 You want an all-rounder: Yes, it\u2019s flexible, but it also looks good, is (relatively) affordable, can be customized and boasts a 3.1.2 channel count \u2013 more numerous than might have been expected at this level.\n\u274c You\u2019re never planning to wall-mount it: If you're certain it\u2019ll always live on a table or shelf, a more traditional soundbar might make more sense. That said, the QS700F still performs brilliantly there too.\n\u274c You want the ultimate in sound: Yes, this is a top-performing soundbar, but you'll notice a slight dip in performance at certain angles. You'll have to pay significantly more for a noticeably better experience though.\nThe Samsung HW-QS700F delivers a clever blend of performance and design, bringing the audio chops of Samsung\u2019s Q series together with the slim, stylish form factor more typical of its S series. What really sets it apart is its ability to auto-adjust its 3.1.2-channel configuration depending on whether it\u2019s placed flat or upright. Stand it vertically and you\u2019ll get a flatter look that pairs beautifully with a slim, wall-mounted TV.\nA 3.1.2-channel setup is generous at this size and price point, delivering a surprisingly punchy, detailed soundstage. Whether positioned horizontally or vertically, the QS700F maintains consistent audio performance. You\u2019ll find Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support here too, along with broad file format compatibility, making it a reliable performer across TV, movies, and games.\nWhile the audio impresses, it\u2019s the smart design that steals the show here. Using built-in gyro sensors, the HW-QS700F adapts automatically to its placement, whether horizontal on a stand or vertical on a wall. The bar itself is long and sleek, while the wireless sub is small and discreet. It\u2019s slim enough to fit neatly under most TVs, but still feels substantial, with a premium finish that elevates the setup.\nConsidering its adaptability, audio capabilities, and premium build, the HW-QS700F offers great value. While many soundbars support wall-mounting, very few actively reconfigure their audio output to suit different placements like this one does. If you want a soundbar that looks great, sounds even better, and adapts to your setup, this is one of the smartest options out there.\nRead our full Samsung HW-QS-700F review\nHow to choose the best Dolby Atmos soundbar\nIf you love the slim aesthetic of your new 4K TV, we can bet it doesn\u2019t have the audio needed to match the visuals. That means picking the best soundbar to go with your TV is your best option to get the most out of your favorite TV shows and films. But how do you choose the best Dolby Atmos soundbar for you?\nThe first consideration is where it'll go. Most of the soundbars in this guide are sleek, minimal and designed to sit flush against a wall or home cinema set-up. You'll need to pick out a space for it and ensure it'll fit. With that in mind, you'll need to consider a soundbar that'll pair well with your TV.\nFor example, the long Sonos Arc soundbar is designed specifically for large screens, so won\u2019t look right with a smaller 50-inch TV. You\u2019ll need to know the size of your current TV and the size of the space you have to fit it and compare those figures to the dimensions listed alongside the soundbar you want to buy.\nYou should also think about the kind of connection you need. Most modern soundbars have HDMI connectivity, but there's also optical connectivity\u2014so what's the difference? These are two ways that audio is passed from your TV to your soundbar, but HDMI passes high-resolution audio, including Dolby Atmos. If you want a premium, immersive listening experience you\u2019ll want to be sure you have an HDMI connection to use from your soundbar and an HDMI ARC (that's audio return channel) port on your TV for it to connect to.\nIf you're looking for an alternative solution to a soundbar, check out the Sony HT-A9 Home Theater System. It comprises four speakers that communicate with each other wirelessly via a tiny box that's slightly larger than an Apple TV, working together to create a further 12 \"phantom\" Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIf you have an iPhone or an iPad, you should also take a look at our guide to the best AirPlay speakers. These allow you to stream music directly from your devices to your speaker. That means room-filling sound from your phone without the need for a more complex entertainment set-up. Some are small and portable, but plenty of soundbars come with AirPlay integration baked in too.\nThe best Dolby Atmos soundbar: FAQs\nAre Dolby Atmos soundbars worth it?\nIf you want the most immersive soundbar experience, then they absolutely are \u2013 mostly at the the more premium end of things, though. They're designed to create spatial audio with 3D effects, which means speakers that have lots of angled drivers and advanced processing make the most of them. It's nice for cheap soundbars to be able to access the audio quality of Atmos, but it's much less essential because they won't create the same kind of 'dome of sound' effect.\nBut not all new soundbars are Dolby Atmos soundbars. Many from from major brands have Dolby Atmos built-in these days, including models from LG, Samsung, Sonos and Sony, and there's a range of sizes and styles with different features to choose from. Whether you choose a Dolby Atmos soundbar or a regular one, they're generally a good idea these days. Screen tech in the best TVs has evolved over the years to make them thinner, but there's less space for big speakers. Soundbars are the solution.\nWhat are the key features of a Dolby Atmos soundbar?\nAny Dolby Atmos soundbar has to use HDMI ARC or HDMI eARC to get sound from your TV \u2013 this is the only way to transmit Atmos sound between the two. Otherwise, the most effective Atmos soundbars will have upfiring drivers \u2013 that means two (or more) speakers pointing upwards, as well as speakers facing forward. One of the big features of Dolby Atmos is that it can add height as well as surround sound, and upfiring drivers are the best way to create this from a soundbar. Some Dolby Atmos soundbars don't have upfiring drivers, but use clever digital processing to add height to the audio\u2026 but it's never as fully effective as having real upfiring drivers.\nDo I need a Dolby Atmos soundbar with a separate subwoofer?\nSome soundbars are all-in-one units that contain all the speakers needed to convey Dolby Atmos. Others come packaged with a subwoofer, a speaker specifically designed to handle the bass and low frequency effects (LFE) in Atmos soundtracks. In most systems, this subwoofer connects wirelessly with the soundbar, and can be either placed nearby or hidden out-of-sight behind furniture.\nDo you need a soundbar with a wireless subwoofer? Not necessarily, though systems that include one generally deliver higher bass impact and can play louder than all-in-one designs. Some all-in-ones on our list like the Sonos Arc and the Bose Smart Soundbar 600 can be upgraded with a wireless subwoofer at extra cost, so you can first try the soundbar out, and if you feel that bass is lacking, add that option at a later date.\nDo I need a Dolby Atmos soundbar with wireless surround speakers?\nNot all Dolby Atmos-enabled tech comes in a soundbar format. For example, the Sonos Era 300 has shaken up this space in a major way. Some Dolby Atmos soundbars come with wireless surround sound speakers, which help to create a fuller sense of immersion in the sound.\nWhile these aren\u2019t completely necessary \u2013 many Dolby Atmos soundbars are designed to deliver a \u201cwraparound effect\u201d where the sound extends beyond the width of the TV screen \u2013 our testing experience has shown that systems with surround sound speakers offer a performance advantage over ones that don\u2019t include them.\nSame as with optional wireless subwoofers, Dolby Atmos soundbar makers, including Sonos, Bose, Samsung, LG, and Sony offer wireless surround sound speakers, and these can be added to the system at a later date to upgrade performance.\nAlso consider\nSeveral new Dolby Atmos soundbars introduced in 2024 are currently being reviewed by TechRadar and could soon be featured in this guide. These include the Sony Theater Bar 9 (HT-A9000), a 13-speaker all-in-one soundbar with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X processing, and multiple HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz, VRR, and ALLM support. The Theater Bar 9 is Sony\u2019s current flagship soundbar, and at $1,399 / \u00a31,199 it\u2019s priced accordingly.\nAlso new from Sony is the Bravia Theater Quad, a wireless system that uses four speakers with 16 total drivers and can optionally be paired with a Sony TV with Acoustic Center Sync support. This $2,499 / \u00a32,499 wireless system is more pricey than even the premium soundbar-based systems featured in this guide, but it has an elegant, unobtrusive design and great sound.\nThe Nakamichi Dragon is an 11.4.6-channel soundbar system that\u2019s billed as a mid-way solution between a flagship soundbar like the Samsung HW-Q990D and an AV receiver and speakers-based system. At $3,299 with dual 8-inch subwoofers, the Dragon is about as premium as soundbars get and promises the highest possible level of immersion.\nBose\u2019s new Smart Soundbar ($499 / \u00a3499) is priced about the same as the Bose Smart Soundbar 600 in our list and offers mostly similar features. The main addition is Personal Surround Sound, a feature that lets you use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds with the soundbar to get surround sound without the extra speakers.\nAt $499 (around \u00a3400 / $AU770), Klipsch\u2019s Flexus 200 soundbar is another budget Dolby Atmos soundbar option that offers impressive sound for the money. Like the Bose, Sony, Sonos, and other soundbars in this guide, it can be paired with Klipsch wireless surround speakers and subwoofers, giving you the option to build a full system as you\u2019re able to afford upgrades.\nHow we test the best Dolby Atmos soundbars\nWe've reviewed hundreds of audio devices over the years and plenty of the best soundbars and best Dolby Atmos soundbars. This means we know what to look for in a soundbar, the level of audio performance to expect and how specs stack up.\nHowever, there are a few key things we consider when we're testing Dolby Atmos soundbars. The first is, as you might expect, sound. Does the speaker deliver on its audio promises? And does it knock our socks off with a performance that sounds like immersive Dolby Atmos? We spend time comparing what a tech company says a soundbar can do with our own experiences playing, and listening to, a range of content.\nDesign is also important. We compare how a soundbar looks to others we've tested in the past, assessing whether it's likely to appeal to people and fit well under, or beside, their TV. We also know that user experience design is just as important as aesthetics. We paid close attention to the set-up process, too. Although we're pros when it comes to setting up audio tech these days, we want to be sure we're recommending devices that anyone can get up-and-running out of the box.\nWe also consider any smart or additional features that could be a nice-to-have and make you choose one device over another. Ultimately, we picked the soundbars above because we wanted to showcase the best Dolby Atmos tech has to offer, as well as the best value soundbars for your home.\nLatest updates to the best Dolby Atmos soundbars\nJuly 7, 2025\nAdded the Samsung HW-QS700F at #10 as our new 'Best for wall-mounting' pick, based on recent testing.\nApril 28, 2025\nSwapped the Bose Smart Soundbar for the Bose Smart Soundbar 600 as 'Best compact soundbar with Dolby Atmos' option.\nJanuary 31, 2025\nSwapped the Sonos Arc for the Sonos Arc Ultra as best Sonos soundbar.\nDecember 3, 2024\nReplaced the Samsung HW-Q800C with the Samsung HW-Q800D for best overall soundbar. added in Buy it if boxes with reasons to buy and avoid for each entry.\nOctober 1, 2024\nAdded image galleries and 'Also consider' section describing new soundbars with reviews in process.\nAugust 2, 2024\nAdded the Hisense AX5125H as the 'best budget soundbar for Dolby Atmos surround' option.\nFebruary 22, 2024\nAdded the Samsung HW-Q800C as the best mid-range Dolby Atmos soundbar, swapped out the Sony HT-G700 for the HT-2000, and dropped the LG S95QR, B&W Panorama 3, Devialet Dione, Philips B8905 and Denon Home Sound Bar 550 due to lack of availability.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

      "text": "The best soundbars for all budgets, all tested by us\nWe've tested everything from elite Dolby Atmos soundbars to cheap and simple TV sound upgrades, and these are the best.\n- Quick list\n- Best overall\n- Best budget\n- Best all-in-one soundbar\n- Best for Dolby Atmos\n- Best budget Atmos surround\n- Best super-cheap surround sound\n- Best super-cheap\n- Best premium for LG TVs\n- Best compact Atmos\n- Best for flexibility\n- Best for expandability\n- Best for wall-mounting\n- Comparison chart\n- How to choose\n- Also consider\n- New soundbars for 2025\n- How we test\n- Latest updates\nOne of the best soundbars is essential if you\u2019ve invested in a big TV and its speakers aren\u2019t living up to its visuals. With one of the top soundbars, you get bigger, forward-facing speakers that deliver better speech clarity and immersion in movies. The best bit is they\u2019re sleek and slim, often fitting below your TV on a cabinet, or mounted on the wall.\nSome TVs may not need a soundbar, but plenty of the best TVs you can buy today benefit hugely from an external soundbar for better audio \u2013 especially cheaper ones. The best soundbars tend to come in three styles: all-in-one units with just a single soundbar, soundbars with subwoofers, and soundbars with subwoofers and rear speakers for surround sound. The first is ideal for people who want a minimal setup, the second is great for big sound on a budget, and the third is perfect if you want a real home theater audio experience.\nWe\u2019ve tested a huge number of soundbars and speaker systems over the years, ranging from elite units with Dolby Atmos 3D sound, through to bargain soundbars that boost speech and add depth for very little cash. We're looking for natural sound in all cases that doesn't come across as overblown, and where individual effects can stand out from the overall mix. We want to see ease of use too, no matter how many different speakers are included and in the case of higher-end soundbars we're looking for extra features such as wireless support and HDMI passthrough (including at 4K 120Hz) to justify the pricing.\nSome soundbars include extra features when used with a particular TV, so we'll highlight those where appropriate, and we do test them \u2013 but they don't make or break our recommendations. We test soundbars as if you're buying them as a neutral, so you can get a great upgrade no matter what TV brand you have.\nThe quick list\nIn a hurry but need to find the best soundbar for you?

He has been writing about the latest soundbars and TV audio since 2017, and has very strong opinions about the correct ratio of HDMI ports to price.\nAugust 6, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung HW-Q990D with the Samsung HW-Q990F as 'best for Dolby Atmos'. Removed the Sony HT-A7000 and 'best for gaming' category. Added in a table with scores for each soundbar on this list labelled 'Comparison Chart'. Updated 'Other soundbars to consider' and 'New for 2025' sections.\nThe best soundbars you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best soundbar overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best-value soundbar: The Q800D delivers a dynamic and punchy sound with impressive Dolby Atmos positional effect for a very good price.\n\u2705 You want a powerful sound: The Q800D is imposing, powerful and immersive, despite being limited to a soundbar and subwoofer in-the-box.\n\u274c You're after 4K 120Hz passthrough: If you have a next-gen console such as a PS5, you'll have to look at other soundbars for 4K 120Hz passthrough.\n\u274c You own the Samsung HW-Q800C: The Q800D doesn't offer much in the way of upgrades over its predecessor, the Samsung HW-Q800C, so if you own the latter, there's no point in upgrading.\nWhat you need to know: The Samsung HW-Q800D is the mid-range soundbar in Samsung's 2024 soundbar lineup, but it delivers a premium performance for the price. It delivers 5.1.2 channels, totaling 360W of power for a sound that's dynamic, engaging and downright impressive. It supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround formats as well as Samsung-centric features such as Q-Symphony, which uses the speakers of compatible Samsung TVs for extra immersion. It also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for audio streaming. It also has gaming features, but does unfortunately lack 4K 120Hz passthrough to make the most out of consoles. But this is one of the very few downsides to a fantastic soundbar, and it won't matter to everyone, anyway.\nAudio performance: When we heard the Q800D in action, we were blown away by just how sonically impressive it is. A rich, expansive and powerful sound comes through the Q800D, whether its movies or video games. Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround is immersive, engaging and fully-fledged, which is impressive for a soundbar comprised of two units (a soundbar and subwoofer). Its wide soundstage also means it handles music well, which is no guarantee with soundbars.\nDesign: In terms of looks, the HW-Q800D isn't very visually appealing, with a chunky design and angular look that some find dull. But, it does have a solid build quality and a metal mesh grille that make it feel more premium. While you can get better-looking soundbars, the Q800D is still a perfectly fine looking soundbar.\nValue: The Q800D is exceptional value and while it's not going to beat the likes of the more premium Samsung HW-Q990D in terms of sheer power, #4 on this list, or the Sonos Arc Ultra for looks, #3 on this list, it delivers a level of quality and performance way above its price range. So, it's no wonder that it's easily the best soundbar on the market for most people.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q800D review\nThe best budget soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable soundbar: The Sony HT-S2000 launched with a higher price than the next cheapest offering at #7 in this list but is now regularly reduced for less.\n\u2705 You want immersive sound: The HT-S2000 offers 3.1 channels of surprisingly powerful sound, with support for virtual Dolby Atmos, for a reasonable price.\n\u274c You own a next-gen console like a PS5: Without 4K 120Hz passthrough, the HT-S2000 isn't the best for gamers. Instead look at #5 in this list.\n\u274c You want a home audio system: The HT-S2000 does not have Wi-Fi so you won't be able to link it up to a multi-room wireless speaker system.\nWhat you need to know: When it comes to sound quality and features vs price, we think the Sony HT-S2000 is the best budget choice around. Although it's a little basic in terms of connectivity, the sound you get from this soundbar is impressive for the money and is certainly a good choice for those looking for an upgrade to their TV sound without breaking the bank.\nAudio performance: While the Sony HT-S2000's sound isn't the biggest, the sound you do get for your money is impressive. Clear dialogue levels and a spacious, virtual surround sound are two of the HT-S2000's highlights. Bass levels are also punchy enough, but it's the Sony HT-S2000's ability to reproduce Dolby Atmos effects that's surprising. It's not going to beat a soundbar with height channels, but for a 3.1 soundbar, it offers plenty.\nDesign: Design wise, the Sony HT-S2000 feels and looks more expensive than it is, with a solid, mesh metal grill on the front and a sturdy black plastic casing housing the speakers. The soundbar also produces visual feedback to remote control commands, something rare on budget soundbars.\nValue: Yes, the HT-S2000 isn't going to set the world alight with its sound and certainly isn't the best soundbar for sound on this list, but when you're paying roughly $349 / \u00a3299 / AU$695 for a soundbar with this good a sound quality, it's hard to argue against.\nRead our full Sony HT-S2000 review\nThe best all-in-one soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want expansive sound from an all-in-one: The Heston 120\u2019s 5.1.2-channel speaker array delivers surprisingly immersive audio and deep bass for an all-in-one unit\n\u2705 You want a unique design: With its guitar-amp-like looks, the Heston 120\u2019s design is certainly unique, making it stand out from the sea of boring, black soundbars.\n\u274c You want the best surround-sound experience: One-box offerings like the Heston 120 can only simulate a true surround experience. You\u2019ll need actual surround speakers to get the real deal.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a tight budget: There are more budget-friendly options that can provide a satisfactory Dolby Atmos experience for less money.\nWhat you need to know: The Marshall Heston 120 is the best all-in-one soundbar you can buy for its asking price. The other soundbars in this list feature additional surround speakers and a subwoofer to deliver a cinematic sound experience, or they skimp out on immersion and bass by opting for a limited speaker array and compact design. The Heston 120, in contrast, features a 5.1.2-channel speaker array with dual active woofers and four passive radiators. With support for both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks, the presentation is impressively wide and tall for an all-in-one, and there\u2019s no shortage of deep, powerful bass.\nAudio performance: The Heston 120\u2019s booming bass filled our TV testing facility when we reviewed it, and even managed to convey deep sub-bass in Atmos movie soundtracks. Height and surround effects are conveyed with spatial precision, which lends a true sense of realism to the proceedings, and we even got a sense of sound moving past our shoulder when we tested it. The same qualities that make the Heston 120 great for movies also work for Atmos and stereo music playback. Stereo music in particular sounds smooth and has clear channel separation \u2013 a rare feat for an all-in-one soundbar.\nDesign: Marshall\u2019s design for the Heston 120 unsurprisingly mimics that of its famous guitar amps, with big, golden-hued metallic control knobs, and a white Marshall logo plastered across the front. It\u2019s surely making a statement in the otherwise bland, black world of soundbar design, and those extra elements can be visually distracting when watching movies in dimmed lighting. Bottom line: you\u2019ll either love the design or you won\u2019t. At over a meter in width, the Heston 120 is also on the large side for a soundbar, and there\u2019s no remote control option outside of Marshall\u2019s app, which provides everything you need to get this soundbar up and running.\nValue: At $999 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,799, the Heston 120 is undoubtedly pricey, and you\u2019ll pay the same price for the also impressive Sonos Arc Ultra, our choice as the best option for expandability in this guide. But the Heston 120\u2019s build quality, performance, and features make it a solid, if not exceptional, value, especially if you\u2019re interested in an all-in-one bar that doesn\u2019t make any sonic compromises.\nRead our full Marshall Heston 120 review\nThe best soundbar for Dolby Atmos\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want immersive surround sound: The Q990F delivers a fully immersive, powerful, and tightly controlled sound that not many other soundbar systems can compete with.\n\u2705 You want a compact subwoofer that doesn't compromise: The Q990F's newly designed compact subwoofer is easier to hide, but doesn't skimp on sheer power and control.\n\u274c You're on a budget: The Q990F is a premium soundbar system that unavoidably costs more than budget Dolby Atmos soundbars like #4 in this list.\n\u274c You own the Samsung HW-Q990D: While the Q990F's new subwoofer is great, elsewhere the Q990F is only a slight upgrade over its predecessor, the Q990D.\nWhat you need to know: Samsung\u2019s Q990F is a complete surround sound system in a soundbar package. It has 23 drivers spread across 11.1.4 channels and comprises four units: a soundbar, a subwoofer, and two rear speakers. It delivers engaging, expansive and punchy sound, as well as 4K 120Hz pass-through support for gaming consoles.\nAudio performance: Dolby Atmos soundtracks are reproduced with superb precision and pinpoint accuracy, putting you right into the heart of the action. Speech is clean and clear, and its newly designed, smaller subwoofer doesn't skip out on bass, delivering plenty of hefty rumble while still maintaining control and nuance. Q-Symphony is a bonus for Samsung TV owners, adding even more speakers to the action.\nDesign: The headline here is the newly designed, compact subwoofer, which is sleeker, sharper and much more versatile in terms of space. The Q990F has a similar matte gray/navy finish to its predecessors for a minimalist look, but uses a grille design that isn't as appealing as its predecessors. Still, it has a premium look and feel with a reassuring heft. Its front display continues to be difficult to read, however\nValue: A soundbar system that's this powerful and complete necessarily comes with a high price tag. And while we think that the Q990F's performance justifies the price, you can save some money by picking up its predecessor, the Q990D. Or if you're looking for a budget alternative, check out the Hisense AX5125H at #5 in this list for a cheaper Atmos alternative.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q990F review\nThe best budget soundbar for Dolby Atmos surround\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want 'real' Atmos sound\nWith 5.1.2 channels, including two surround and two up-firing Atmos speakers, you're getting actual immersive sound rather than virtual processing.\n\u2705 You want to save money\nAt around $350 / \u00a3350 / AU$449, you\u2019re getting a full surround sound speaker package with a subwoofer for the price of many standalone soundbars.\n\u274c You want high-quality music playback\nHisense\u2019s budget bar uses Bluetooth exclusively for music streaming, and that\u2019s a lower-quality option than the Wi-Fi tech used by other soundbars like the Sonos Beam.\n\u274c You want to experiment with EQ\nWhile the Hisense has preset sound modes plus bass and treble controls, its sound adjustments are very basic compared to other soundbars that offer extensive EQ settings and room correction using apps.\nWhat you need to know: The Hisense AX5125H is a 5.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar system with a wireless subwoofer and surround speakers that sells for under $350 / \u00a3350 / AU$450. What you\u2019re getting here kit-wise for the money is pretty much unbeatable considering the system\u2019s punchy sound and \u201creal\u201d as opposed to virtual, Dolby Atmos effects delivery.\nAudio performance: Hisense\u2019s budget soundbar system punches well above its price class when it comes to sound quality, with clear dialogue, accurate effects placement and good surround immersion. Even music sounds good, though, streaming is limited to Bluetooth quality. The one complaint we have about its sound is that the compact rear speakers can occasionally get overwhelmed by aggressive surround sound mixes.\nDesign: The AX5125H\u2019s build quality falls short of premium \u2013 something to be expected at this price \u2013 though its metal mesh speaker grilles give it a somewhat upscale look. Importantly, the soundbar has a front panel alphanumeric LED display, which provides clear visual feedback when making volume or EQ adjustments with the system\u2019s remote control.\nValue: Given its low price for a 5.1.2-channel soundbar system, the Hisense AX5125H\u2019s value is almost over the top. You\u2019ll pay more than four times as much for the Best soundbar for Dolby Atmos choice on our list, the Samsung HW-Q990D, and while that 11.1.4-channel system will undoubtedly provide a greater sense of sound immersion, many people will be satisfied with the Hisense\u2019s sound for the money.\nRead our full Hisense AX5125H review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar for surround sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want surround sound for cheap: The Poseidon D50 offers 5.1 channels of clear, punchy sound for cheaper than most soundbars.\n\u2705 You want a straightforward soundbar: The Poseidon D50 opts for a no-nonsense, plug-in-and-play approach over apps and features.\n\u274c You want the best quality sound: The Poseidon D50's sound can be tinny at times, and rear speakers can get lost in the mix.\n\u274c You want the best looking soundbar: Unsurprisingly, the Poseidon D50 has a plain, plasticky look due to its super-cheap price.\nThe Ultimea Poseidon D50 is the best way to get surround sound for your living room for a low price. Its sound may not be the most dynamic and it's light on features, but at such a low price for a full 5.1 system, it's hard to argue against what it does deliver: clear, punchy and occasionally spacious audio.\nIn our review of the Ultimea Poseidon D50, we enjoyed its clarity of speech and relatively punchy, powerful surround sound. While watching Top Gun: Maverick, we were \"impressed at the three-dimensional sound of soaring aircraft\", especially considering the lack of Dolby Atmos. While the Poseidon D50 doesn't deliver the most cinematic of experiences, with audio sometimes veering on tinny and the rear speakers sometimes struggling to keep up, we said \"for the price you pay, the surround sound certainly surpassed expectations\" and that's all we ask for from this cheap soundbar.\nLight on features due to its budget price, including a lack of Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support (check out the Hisense AX5125H further up the list for a budget Atmos surround soundbar), the Poseidon D50 does still support Bluetooth streaming for music and come with HDMI ARC, optical and 3.5mm ports for connections. There are also three distinct sound modes \u2013 Movie, Dialog and Music \u2013 to cater to what you're watching.\nUltimately, you get what you pay for, and the Ultimea Poseidon D50 delivers solid (but not mind-blowing) surround sound for under $150 / \u00a3150 (we've seen it as low as $119 / \u00a3139). At that price, it's difficult to be disappointed in the Poseidon D50. If you want surround sound for cheap, the Poseidon D50 should be on your list.\nRead our full Ultimea Poseidon D50 review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap, but good soundbar: A 2.0-channel soundbar like this is an easy way to upgrade your TV\u2019s sound without incurring a high cost.\n\u2705 You want easy setup: The limited features of Amazon\u2019s soundbar are a benefit if you\u2019re looking for a super-easy model to connect, set up, and use.\n\u274c You want Dolby Atmos support: Dolby Atmos support generally isn\u2019t available on low-cost soundbars like Amazon\u2019s. To get that feature, you\u2019ll need to step up to the Sony HT-S2000, the best budget model on our list.\n\u274c You want bass: The Amazon\u2019s compact design doesn\u2019t permit much in the way of bass, so if that\u2019s important, look for a different model with a separate subwoofer.\nWhat you need to know: Amazon\u2019s first and only soundbar is a basic, compact model that delivers decent sound quality for the price. A 2.0-channel design, it keeps things simple by limiting wired connections to a single HDMI input for a hookup to a TV\u2019s HDMI eARC/ARC port, along with an optical digital connection. Bluetooth is additionally supported for wireless music streaming from a phone or tablet.\nAlthough Amazon\u2019s soundbar lacks Dolby Atmos support, it has Movie, Music and dialogue-boosting EQ modes as well as DTS Virtual:X processing to add a spacious quality to surround-encoded soundtracks. There\u2019s no front-panel alphanumeric display to provide visual feedback \u2013 something you wouldn\u2019t expect to see in a soundbar at this price \u2013 but ergonomics are otherwise good, and with limited connections and features, setup of Amazon\u2019s soundbar is incredibly easy.\nThe Amazon Fire TV soundbar\u2019s main selling point is its price. Amazon lists it for $119.99 / \u00a3199.99 on its site, but regularly lets it go for under $100 in the US. If you\u2019re looking for a basic, super-cheap bar that does a decent job and is easy to set up, Amazon\u2019s soundbar is the one we\u2019d recommend.\nAudio performance: While you can\u2019t expect a 2-channel soundbar like this to work magic with movie soundtracks, Amazon\u2019s bar will provide an instant upgrade over your TV\u2019s built-in speakers, boosting dialogue clarity and adding heft to sound effects. In our review, we found it provided the best sound balance with the Bass setting at Medium, which made voices sound natural and not overly heavy. DTS Virtual:X processing was effective at amping up movie soundtracks and did so without any negative effect to other elements in the mix.\nDesign: At 24 inches wide by 2.5 inches high and 3.5 inches deep, Amazon\u2019s compact soundbar is a good match for smaller TVs. A row of control buttons is provided on top and a remote control is also included. The main design limitation is the LED indicator lights instead of an alphanumeric display for visual feedback, which is common at this price point.\nValue: Given the sound quality, effortless usability, and sturdy design of Amazon\u2019s Fire TV soundbar, it\u2019s a great value and easy recommendation. You\u2019ll have to spend several hundred more to get better performance and features, and many people will be perfectly satisfied with Amazon\u2019s low-budget bar.\nRead our full Amazon Fire TV soundbar review\nThe best premium soundbar for LG TVs\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want immersive, home theater sound: With 9.1.5 channels here along with AI room calibration, you're in for a surround sound treat.\n\u2705 You have an LG TV: It works well whatever you pair it with, but you get access to better features with certain models of LG TVs.\n\u274c You don't have much space: This soundbar system is large, so if you don't have room to spare opt for a smaller alternative like #5 in this list.\n\u274c You're saving money: This isn't a budget buy. You'll have to make sacrifices, but you can find a similar soundbar for less. Check out #2 in this list.\nWhat you need to know: The LG S95TR brings you the convenience and straightforward setup of a soundbar system but with the immersive power and performance of a home theater speaker setup. It works well with everything, but LG TV owners can unlock the best features. The only thing that lets it down a little is its high price. If you're on a budget but still want Atmos and surround sound, take a look at our cheap soundbar pick, the Hisense AX5125H at #4 in this list. But if you can afford it, the features, performance and design of the LG S95TR make it worth every penny.\nAudio performance: With this soundbar's 9.1.5 channels, along with some very impressive AI room calibration, you'll experience a great home theater setup with surround sound and spatial audio (Dolby Atmos and DTS:X). In our review, we described the sound on offer here as \"immersive, engrossing, and engaging\" and with 810 watts of power, the LG S95TR can reach great volumes.\nDesign: This soundbar looks very basic with a subwoofer and two wedge-shaped rear speakers. Unfortunately, there's no LED display, just LED indicator lights, which is disappointing considering how many features are on offer here. You'll need to open LG's control app to find what you need, which is a little annoying. This is also a big system. So if you want to put it in a small room, it might not be the best choice for you.\nValue: The LG S95TR\u2019s $1,499 / AU$1,699 (about \u00a31,200) price feels expensive, but when you compare it with the competition, the fact you're getting a 9.1.5-channel system and the performance on offer here, it's still good value. If you want real surround sound, check out #3 in this list, the Samsung HW-Q990D.\nRead our full LG S95TR review\nThe best compact Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great sound from a standalone soundbar: The Smart Soundbar delivers the Bose audio quality one expects. The bass and soundstage width are a bit light, but clarity and dynamics are good.\n\u2705 You want real Dolby Atmos: The soundbar\u2019s two upward-firing speakers let it deliver a real spatial audio experience. Also, a TrueSpace feature can upscale non-Dolby Atmos tracks for spatial audio.\n\u274c You want full surround sound: Adding Bose Ultra Open Earbuds can give a great surround sound experience, but just for one person. If you want full surround sound for around the same price, other options are available.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a tight budget: The Smart Soundbar has a premium price for a single soundbar. You can find similar compact soundbars for less, but you will compromise on both sound quality and features.\nWhat you need to know: The Bose Smart Soundbar is a compact model with real upfiring speakers to properly deliver Dolby Atmos soundtracks. It has built-in Wi-Fi for streaming music, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast support, and can be paired with optional Bose wireless surround sound speakers and a subwoofer if you one day get an urge to upgrade your system. Alternatively, the Smart Soundbar\u2019s Personal Surround Sound feature, which requires Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, can give you surround sound without having to muck with extra speakers.\nAudio performance: When we reviewed the Bost Smart Soundbar, we noted that it \u201csounds about as good as a soundbar can.\u201d Dialogue is \u201cconsistently intelligible,\u201d and there are level and EQ controls in Bose\u2019s app that let you boost it on an as-needed basis. Because of its compact form factor, both bass and soundstage width are limited, but the Smart Soundbar\u2019s upfiring Atmos speakers, which can also be engaged for non-Atmos movies and music using the TrueSpace feature, help quite a bit to expand the soundfield.\nDesign: At 27 inches wide by 2 inches high and 4 inches deep, it\u2019s a fairly sleek and compact design for an all-in-one unit and a perfect choice for smaller homes or screens. While it only has a single HDMI port, it makes up for this by packaging everything into an attractive all-in-one form.\nValue: This soundbar impressed us in several ways during our testing, and we also appreciated its Personal Surround Sound and TrueSpace features The Bose is also a good value \u2013 as one of the few soundbars that sell for under $500 / \u00a3500 / AU$700, it offers a lot more features than the Sony HT-S2000 at #2 in this list and Amazon Fire TV Soundbar at #8 in this list.\nTo save money on Bose products, check out our Bose discount codes.\nRead our full Bose Smart Soundbar review\nThe best soundbar for flexibility\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need multiple HDMI ports: The JBL Bar 1300X comes with four HDMI ports so multiple devices can be connected.\n\u2705 You want rear speakers with no wires: Supplied with wireless rechargeable speakers, there's no wires to keep things neat and tidy.\n\u274c You want to keep the rear speakers charged: The JBL Bar 1300X's rear speakers need regular recharging, unlike a more traditional setup like the HW-Q800D at #1 in this list.\n\u274c You want the cheapest soundbar: The JBL Bar 1300X is not budget-friendly, even compared to other soundbars in its price range.\nWhat you need to know: The JBL Bar 1300X provides a fantastic level of flexibility. With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support and a big, beefy sound aided by its larger than average subwoofer, its the connections and features packed into this soundbar that make it so versatile compared to other soundbars on the market. The one downside? This soundbar isn't going to suit serious gamers. While there are multiple HDMI ports here, none of them have 4K 120Hz pass-through to support that resolution and frame rate when playing games on PS5 or Xbox Series X, a feature you can find on our choice on the best soundbar for gaming, the Sony HT-A7000 at #5 in this list.\nAudio performance: We think the JBL Bar 1300X would suit anyone looking for a powerful and immersive soundbar option, but particularly those who are after the visceral excitement that the best home theater systems effortlessly deliver, while also being relatively easy to setup and not becoming a burden on your living room.\nDesign: Although the JBL Bar 1300X doesn't take up too much space, it is designed to fill larger rooms with sound so we wouldn't recommend it in smaller homes. There are also multiple HDMI inputs here, meaning you can connect a stack of extra sources without worry, and the system\u2019s rechargeable rear speakers can also be used as portable Bluetooth speakers. That might be a \"so what?\" feature for some people, but to us it's a design flex that heightens the Bar 1300X's overall value.\nValue: Priced in line with the likes of the Sonos Arc Ultra at #3 in this list, the JBL Bar 1300X is not cheap but does deliver a lot flexibility to make up for it. From the rechargeable rear speakers that can also be used as bluetooth speakers and number of HDMI ports to the easy setup and immersive sound, this is one of the most flexible soundbars we've found. (Note: in some countries, you get the JBL Bar 1300 \u2013 without the X \u2013 which has a smaller 10-inch subwoofer driver instead of the 12-inch in the X version. This is a relatively small difference, and doesn't alter our overall opinion.)\nRead our full JBL Bar 1300X review\nThe best soundbar for expandability\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want big and cinematic sound: The Arc Ultra's special bass driver sounds excellent, and its sound balance is excellent, especially the dialogue.\n\u2705 You want an expandable soundbar: You get great Dolby Atmos effects from a single box here , and it can be easily expanded with Sonos surround speakers and subs.\n\u274c You want high-end DTS:X support: Fans of Blu-rays or streaming IMAX Enhanced movies may be annoyed by this \u2013 you won't get the full power.\n\u274c You struggle to have enough HDMI ports on your TV: There's no HDMI passthrough here, so you simply lose the use of whichever port it's connected to.\nWhat you need to know: The Sonos Arc Ultra is the best soundbar for expandability. It sounds great on its own, but the flexible nature of the Sonos ecosystem lets you easily add surround speakers and a subwoofer as your needs and budget change. Other soundbars here deliver more immersion by filling your room with multiple boxes, but if you want deep, expansive, expertly balanced movie audio from one slender bar, with the option to add to it later, this is the way to go.\nAudio performance: The Sonos Arc Ultra is a very impressive piece of audio design, thanks partly to its 'Sound Motion' bass driver, which is a very small speaker that produces decent bass without a separate subwoofer. It helps the overall sound balance of the Arc Ultra to be absolutely superb, with great impact, very clear yet natural dialogue, and effects that jump right out of the mix. The Dolby Atmos 3D sound is excellent for a single-box soundbar as well, really adding motion and layers to individual sounds. A massive upgrade over any TV's built-in sound.\nDesign: This is small for a powerful one-box soundbar \u2013 but that's relative! It's pretty wide, though will work for TVs of 55 inches and up, but it's not too tall or deep (though may be too tall for some very low-slung TVs). It feels really well made, and the simple, hard-shell black or white design disappears nicely into your decor. The connections are in a recess in the back \u2013 as is the Bluetooth pairing button, annoyingly (but you can use the Sonos app to pair too). It's wall-mountable, too.\nValue: This is strong value, simply because it sounds so good for under $1000 / \u00a31000. It's also great that it works as part of the Sonos ecosystem, and can be expanded with Sonos' wireless speakers as rear speakers, or with a dedicated, more powerful subwoofer. However, its lack of DTS-HD/DTS:X support and not having an HDMI passthrough port when all of its key rivals do mean it's less-than-perfect on value \u2013 but if you don't care about those things, then they're not a problem!\nRead our full Sonos Arc Ultra review\nThe best soundbar for wall-mounting\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a versatile design: It\u2019s our top choice for wall-mounting, but it\u2019s just as happy on a tabletop. If you want flexibility for both, you\u2019ll find it here.\n\u2705 You want more powerful sound than a standard TV can muster: You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the low profile of this soundbar means it doesn\u2019t pack a punch, but no built-in TV sound is anywhere near this good.\n\u274c You\u2019d prefer a full surround sound experience: You\u2019ll get a pleasingly large soundstage here, but with no rear speakers, it won\u2019t wrap sound around you like the best systems can.\n\u274c Wall-mounting is only a \u201cnice to have\u201d: Pretty sure you won\u2019t wall-mount it? Look elsewhere. It\u2019s still a great choice, but if it\u2019ll always sit on your TV table, its versatility won\u2019t matter.\nWhat you need to know: The Samsung HW-QS700F soundbar blends the performance of Samsung\u2019s Q series with the sleek, lifestyle-friendly design of its S series. Its standout feature is the ability to automatically optimize its 3.1.2-channel speaker setup depending on whether it\u2019s mounted horizontally or vertically. In vertical mode, its flatter profile pairs neatly with a slim, wall-mounted TV. Sound quality is solid for the price, with support for Dolby Atmos, DTS and Bluetooth. It comes with a Samsung wireless subwoofer and can also be paired with surround speakers \u2013 but it\u2019s the wall-mounting versatility that really sets this model apart.\nAudio Performance: Despite its affordable price, this soundbar\u2019s 3.1.2-channel configuration delivers an impressive level of power, detail, and staging. Most of that top-performing sound holds up regardless of its orientation, though there are some minor niggles depending on how you use it. Then again, as we noted in our review, it still outperforms the vast majority of rivals. You\u2019ll also get to enjoy Dolby Atmos playback, DTS:X support and compatibility with a broad range of file formats.\nDesign: The design is where the HW-QS700F truly shines. It features gyro sensors that automatically adjust the speaker configuration for optimal performance whether it\u2019s placed on a table or wall-mounted. The long, angular bar and its compact, cubic wireless sub are surprisingly space-efficient for such a powerful system. It\u2019s slender enough to slide beneath most TV screens or can easily be mounted on the wall underneath one, yet long and deep enough to promise potent sound and a premium finish.\nValue: Considering its blend of performance and features, the Samsung HW-QS700F is a compelling choice. While many soundbars can either be wall-mounted or tabletop-set, few adjust their speaker configuration to optimize performance for both setups. It\u2019s a great option in its own right, but it\u2019s our top pick for wall-mounting \u2013 ideal if you want to take full advantage of that versatility or simply love the option to move it around.\nRead our full Samsung HW-QS700F review\nBest soundbars: comparison chart\nBelow, you'll find a chart showing the scores of every soundbar featured on this list, based on the criteria on which we review them: Features, Performance, Design, Setup & usability and Value. You can sort each column by clicking on its header.\nHow to choose the best soundbar\nThere are several things to consider when you\u2019re looking for the best soundbar.\nThe first is the size. You\u2019ll want to make sure that your soundbar fits under\u2014or next to, depending on your set-up\u2014your TV. For example, the long Sonos Arc soundbar is designed specifically for large screens, so won\u2019t look right with a smaller 50-inch TV. You\u2019ll need to know the size of your current TV and the size of the space you have to fit it and compare those figures to the dimensions listed alongside the soundbar you want to buy.\nYou\u2019ll also want to consider whether you need a Dolby Atmos speaker or not. Dolby Atmos is surround sound technology, placing sounds and voices all around you so that whatever you\u2019re watching or listening to is more immersive. The thing is, Dolby Atmos-enabled soundbars tend to be more expensive. You\u2019ll need to weigh up whether Dolby Atmos sound is worth it for you. Otherwise, consider a capable but cheaper option, like the Sony HT-S2000, our choice for best budget soundbar.\nAnother thing you\u2019ll want to watch out for is the kind of connection you need. You\u2019ll find most modern soundbars have HDMI connectivity, but there's also optical connectivity\u2014so what's the difference? These are two ways that audio is passed from your TV to your soundbar, but HDMI passes high-resolution audio, including Dolby Atmos.\nIf you want a premium, immersive listening experience you\u2019ll want to be sure you have an HDMI connection to use from your soundbar and an HDMI ARC (that's audio return channel) or eARC (enhanced audio return channel, a higher-resolution connection) port on your TV for it to connect to.\nBut this means one of your TV's HDMI ports is used up by the soundbar, so some bars come with HDMI 'passthrough' ports, meaning you can connect a console/set-top box/etc to the soundbar, and it passes the visuals back to your TV. If your TV has few HDMI ports, you'll want a soundbar with this feature.\nThere\u2019s more to think about, but getting the size, audio features and connectivity nailed down early on should make finding the best soundbar for you much easier.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nThe best way to connect a soundbar to your TV is with an HDMI cable. You'll need to make sure you have an HDMI port on your soundbar and an HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV. This allows you to use a cable to connect them.\nAn HDMI port means that the highest quality audio can pass from your TV to your soundbar, like Dolby Atmos.\nIf your TV or soundbar doesn't have HDMI ports, the second best option is an optical. This can still transfer digital sounds, but not the high-resolution ones you'd get with HDMI.\nHowever, you will still get quality audio and an optical connection does work with soundbars and surround sound systems.\nWhat size soundbar should I get?\nYou need to get a soundbar that fits in the space you have available. Some people have their TV mounted and a soundbar could happily be mounted underneath. Others have their TV on a stand and the soundbar can sit in front of it.\nConsider the space you have free but also the size of your TV. A compact soundbar might look silly with a massive screen and vice versa. There are many different-sized soundbars available to suit your TV, so make sure you check the dimensions and match them up.\nCan soundbars do surround sound?\nTrue surround sound means speakers are positioned around you. Some soundbars on this list, like the Samsung Q990D and Hisense AX5125H, also come with a subwoofer and two smaller rear channel speakers, meaning you can place them around your room.\nHowever, other devices with only one soundbar claim to offer surround sound. What this means is they deliver a stereo effect, which seems more like sound is coming from different directions, but isn't.\nMany of the high-end soundbars in this list also have Dolby Atmos built-in. Again, this isn't technically surround sound, but the audio tech is advanced and creates the illusion of immersive sound by bouncing sounds off the walls and ceiling around you.\nAre Dolby Atmos soundbars really worth it?\nAlthough not all the soundbars on this list capture Dolby Atmos as well as a home theatre system, more and more soundbars are supporting Dolby Atmos, making it available to people with all budgets.\nYes, the level of detail you get from a full home theater system compared to soundbars with 'virtual' Atmos or surround soundbars isn't quite as high, Dolby Atmos soundbars are becoming more sophisticated and provide an extra level of immersion to your cinema experience.\nAre soundbars worth it?\nAbsolutely. Even if you don't consider yourself a hardcore cinephile, the best soundbars make a world of difference to your TV watching experience\u2014even the built-in speakers that come with the best TVs just don't do your favorite films, TV shows, and games justice.\nHow much should I spend on a soundbar?\nIt depends on what you're looking for. If you want the very best soundbar technology has to offer, you might be looking at prices of $800 / \u00a3800 / AU$1,000 and upwards.\nHowever, there are lots of fantastic budget soundbars on the market, with some costing less than $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150. Just bear in mind that you generally get what you pay for, and these budget models probably won't come with premium features like Dolby Atmos, included rear speakers, and hi-res audio support.\nBut, the mid-range market is getting more competitive and it really is easy to get a lot of bang for your buck, with soundbars (on our list above) providing Dolby Atmos and a subwoofer for under $400/\u00a3400/AU$650 becoming more and more common.\nWhere should I put a soundbar?\nYou generally have two options when it comes to soundbar placement: wall-mounting it, or placing in below your TV on your TV cabinet. If your soundbar is quite tall, wall-mounting may be the best option, as it could obscure the IR receiver on your TV, rendering your remote control useless.\nDoes my soundbar brand need to match my TV?\nQuick answer: No, any soundbar can be used with any TV. That\u2019s because all TVs made over the past decade feature HDMI (ARC or eARC) and optical digital connections that output audio signals, and virtually every soundbar will feature both HDMI and optical digital inputs to accept that output. And even if you\u2019re mixing brands, a TV\u2019s HDMI-CEC feature will conveniently let you control the soundbar's volume level using the TV remote control.\nHaving said that, there are instances where combining soundbar and TV brands will yield benefits. Many Samsung soundbars, such as our best overall pick, the Samsung HW-Q800D, for example, support a feature called Q-Symphony that lets you combine the sound output of the TV\u2019s built-in speakers with the soundbar\u2019s output for an enhanced, more spacious audio presentation. And LG soundbars support a similar feature called Wow Orchestra that automatically integrates the soundbar and TV speakers when connected to a compatible LG TV. In both cases, you will experience more powerful, immersive soundstage than you would from just the soundbar working alone.\nAnother benefit to using the same-brand soundbars and TVs is the ability to make a lossless wireless audio connection between the two \u2013 no HDMI cables required. Once again, this feature is supported by select TVs and soundbars from Samsung, which simply calls it Wireless Dolby Atmos, and LG, which calls its version WowCast.\nWhat is Eclipsa Audio, and does my soundbar need it?\nAt the recent CES 2025 trade show, Samsung announced a new immersive audio format meant to compete with Dolby Atmos. Eclipsa Audio was jointly developed by Samsung and Google, and it will be supported by new Samsung TVs and soundbars coming out in 2025. Other TV and soundbar brands didn\u2019t announce any new products with Eclipsa Audio support at CES, but since Google is involved, the format will certainly be supported on future TVs that run the Google TV smart TV platform (Hisense, Sony, TCL, among others).\nEclipsa Audio differs from Dolby Atmos in that it\u2019s a channel-based format. Dolby Atmos soundtracks are \u201cobject-based\u201d mixes comprised of audio \u201cobjects\u201d positioned in 3D space that are scaled to a specific speaker configuration (e.g., 7.1.4 Atmos, 5.1-channel surround, 2-channel stereo). Eclipsa Audio, in contrast, supports up to 28 input channels, which Samsung and Google say is sufficient to provide an immersive 3D audio experience on systems ranging from headphones to multichannel home theaters.\nWhile its license-free status should make it appealing to hardware manufacturers (Dolby, in contrast, charges licensing fees for Dolby Atmos), a key challenge that Eclipsa Audio faces is streaming services support. Dolby Atmos is firmly entrenched in the streaming ecosystem, while Eclipsa Audio is currently only supported by Google-owned YouTube. Given that situation, it\u2019s safe to say that Eclipsa Audio support on soundbars is a non-issue for now, though it\u2019s something to keep an eye on for the future.\nOther soundbars to consider\nWe\u2019ve reviewed several soundbars recently that didn\u2019t make this guide for various reasons, though they are also worth considering.\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar: An all-in-one competitor to the Sonos Arc, but with a slight lack of heft to its sound and a limited sense of height, this soundbar isn't great enough value to make it into the list. You can read our full Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar review to learn more.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus: This soundbar really earns its keep with superior delivery of Atmos effects and extended bass. It's well worth consideration if you're looking for something that's a single-unit and if price isn't a worry, but it's expensive, and that's why it hasn't made our list here. Give our full Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus review a read if you want big sound without multiple boxes.\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini: If the price of the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus is too much for your budget, this is a more compact and lower-cost model that provides a \u201cbig\u201d sound, but doesn\u2019t match the Plus when it comes to bass extension and Atmos height effects. It's a similar size to the Sonos Beam Gen 2. We'd choose that model over this one for overall audio quality, but you can read our Sennheiser Ambeo Mini review to learn more.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6: Sony's entry-level bar in its Theater lineup for 2025 delivers a powerful performance with awesome bass and full, clear and precise sound. It's also great value for money, but cheaper alternatives keep the Theater 6 off our list: for now. Read our Sony Bravia Theater 6 review for more info.\nNew soundbars arriving in 2025\nBelow are soundbars that we're either in the middle of testing or anticipate testing as 2025 rolls on. Some of these may even make it onto our list!\nFirst up, the Creative Stage Pro 2.1 is a budget-friendly, 2-channel soundbar that has a premium-looking design for cheap. This review is currently in progress.\nThe KEF XIO was recently announced and shown at Audio Advice Live 2025 and delivers a 5.1.2-channel configuration with a sleek, premium design. From what we heard, we were impressed. The KEF XIO joins a competitive all-in-one soundbar market with Marshall and Sonos, but it could be a real winner.\nFrom JBL, we have two entries: the JBL Bar 1000 MK2 and the JBL Bar 1300 MK2, the latter of which is the successor to the JBL Bar 1300X on our list. Two Dolby Atmos packages with rear speakers and wireless subwoofer included, JBL's standout feature is the detachable rear speakers, which can also be attached to the soundbar for easy movement and sound customization. We look forward to testing these out after having raved about the JBL Bar 1300X.\nHow we test the best soundbars\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,600 TV and home theater reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 16 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWhen we test the best soundbars, we look at categories such as audio performance, design, setup and usability, value for money and features - the same criteria we use for our reviews of soundbars.\nSources: After connecting the soundbar to a TV, we play not only streaming and 4K Blu-ray sources through the TV into the soundbar using the TV\u2019s HDMI eARC connection (as 4K Blu-ray provides better audio quality than streaming), but also music over a Bluetooth wireless connection.\nAudio overview: For audio performance, there are several factors we look at when testing. Soundbars are often used to upgrade a TV's built-in sound, so dialogue clarity and volume are key, as that\u2019s where built-in TV speakers usually struggle the most. We also test bass, mids and trebles by listening to how each range sits within a mix, and also whether the soundstage is wide or narrow.\nSpatial audio: Dolby Atmos spatial audio and surround sound (both virtually and physically through extra speakers) have become common features on soundbars, so we will test the effectiveness and spaciousness of the surround sound, as some people will want a room-filling home theater feel without all the boxes needed for a full AV setup.\nHDMI passthrough: When it comes to higher-end soundbars, we expect 4K 120Hz passthrough on HDMI ports and will test that feature if available. Gamers specifically look for this feature as some TVs don\u2019t have the four HDMI 2.1 ports needed to cover both games consoles and a soundbar.\nMusic: Bluetooth streaming is more commonly being featured on soundbars as manufacturers look to offer an \u2018all-in-one\u2019 solution for movies and music. So, if a soundbar offers that feature, we\u2019ll be sure to test its performance with streamed music. On more premium soundbars, we expect to see Wi-Fi streaming, although this is not always the case.\nSetup and ease-of-use: This is another area we test, as some soundbars carry a plug-in-and-play philosophy whilst others require more in-depth calibration. More soundbars are featuring auto-calibration features to adjust the sound for the room they\u2019re installed in, and this can make a big difference in sound quality. As part of our tests, we\u2019ll listen to a soundbar before and after this calibration to see just how much of a difference it makes.\nConsistency: While we strive to maintain consistency in testing conditions, some of our writers have different setups they\u2019ll be listening in. However, the tests carried out and the testing criteria are the same for all our reviews.\nLatest updates\nAugust 6, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung HW-Q990D with the Samsung HW-Q990F as 'best for Dolby Atmos'.
