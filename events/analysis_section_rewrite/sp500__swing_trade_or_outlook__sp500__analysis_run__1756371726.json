      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but falls short on several fronts: the “Movers & Scenarios” section mixes multiple drivers in a single line and lacks a clear causal chain (e.g., you combine Ford’s dividend appeal with Fed minutes without explaining how the latter lifts risk sentiment for Ford specifically). Replace each line with a single, tightly‑linked driver, a precise mechanism, a concrete watch metric, and a probability that reflects the evidence (e.g., cite the 5.18 % yield and forward P/E 10.3 for Ford’s upside, and the 1.3 billion loss for the downside). Use only one driver per line and avoid bundling unrelated events. For the swing trade, the entry/stop/target are missing; instead, specify a realistic entry (e.g., 3‑5 % below current price), a stop (e.g., 2‑3 % above entry), and a target (e.g., 10‑12 % above entry) derived from Ford’s historical support/resistance or a 1‑month moving average. Quantify the probability of each scenario with a short justification (e.g., “35 % probability that Fed minutes confirm dovish stance, lifting risk sentiment for dividend plays” citing OGK8WLL69). Ensure the swing trade line follows the mandated format exactly: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100. If you cannot fill all fields, shorten to a single line but still include all required elements. Remove the generic “current price” line and replace it with a concrete trade plan. Finally, double‑check that every citation ID is valid and that you haven’t omitted critical sources (e.g., the 5.18 % yield ID W2622L6WW). This will produce a coherent, actionable, and evidence‑backed swing trade or outlook.",
