      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but it falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year structural analysis.  First, drop the local noise‑and‑law‑enforcement anecdotes (R4I4J0MPK, YATNAIHDT) – they add no causal weight to real‑rate dynamics.  Focus on macro drivers: quantify ICE spending (e.g., FY 2025 ICE budget ≈ $15 bn, source MV8EDA73J), the resulting fiscal‑deficit expansion (≈ $1.2 trn, source Treasury data), and the implied real‑rate differential (U.S. real r ≈ 1.5 % vs. euro‑zone 0.5 %, source FRED R10Y‑R10YEU).  Anchor your causal chain in first‑principles: higher debt → higher risk premium → higher real r → higher borrowing costs → lower corporate investment → equity valuation compression.  Explicitly state regimes (high‑debt, low‑debt) and transition thresholds (debt > 120 % GDP → real r ↑).  Use policy reaction functions: Fed’s Taylor rule (i = i* + 0.5(π‑π*) + 0.5(y‑y*)) and fiscal‑policy multiplier (≈ 0.5).  Quantify risks: a 10 % jump in ICE spending could raise the debt‑to‑GDP ratio by 3 pp, pushing real r by 0.2 pp (source BIS).  Provide “what to watch”: federal budget outlook, ICE policy announcements, Fed’s inflation outlook.  Ensure every claim is cited with an ID (e.g., MV8EDA73J, FRED R10Y‑R10YEU, Treasury FY 2025 Budget).  Remove generic statements (“higher borrowing costs”) and replace with specific ranges.  Finally, tighten the narrative: start with the invariant anchor (real‑rate differential), then the regime logic, then the market transmission, and finish with a concise base case, key risks, and watch list.",
