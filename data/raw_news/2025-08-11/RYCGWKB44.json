  "description": "\"The people are exhausted, suffering from the heat, and several children have fevers,\" said a medical humanitarian group which check on people in the camp.",
  "content": "Around 200 migrants awaiting housing in Francehave spent the past seven days camped outside Paris City Hall. Mostly women, children and families have gathered on the square in front of the building, next to the Seine, as part of a protest organized by a French-based humanitarian association, according to reports. Utopia 56 reportedly said it wants the migrants to receive shelter, while also condemning the \"increasingly aggressive\" expulsions taking place in France since last year's Olympic Games. It is said almost half of the people gathered outside the building (90) are children, with a third of them under the age of three. Nathan Lequeux, coordinator of Utopia 56's Parisbranch, said the association is prepared to continue the protest.\n\nHe told InfoMigrantslast week: \u201cWe will not move until a lasting solution is found.\u201d Protestors remained outside the building in the heart of the French capital on Monday. Humanitarian medical association M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, shared images of migrants under makeshift shelters made out of blue tarpaulin.\n\nThe charity said it had been carrying out medical checks amid searing temperatures in Paris and called for the migrants to receive accommodation. \u201cFor nearly a week, more than 200 people have been surviving in a makeshift camp in front of the city hall in Paris. Our teams organised medical consultations this morning,\u201d its French account said on X. \u201cThe people are exhausted, suffering from the heat, and several children have fevers. \u201cDecent housing is a minimum prerequisite to ensure the physical and mental health of these families, these children, and these unaccompanied minor girls. These individuals are extremely vulnerable. They must be sheltered urgently.\u201d One married couple had been living on the streets for a month with their four-month-old daughter, the French news agency AFP reported. Mr Lequeux told InfoMigrants: \u201cWe've had more and more single women in recent months, sometimes between 70 and 90 per evening. Now, it's mostly families.\u201d A Paris City Hall spokesperson said last week it continues to open \"centres in both summer and winter to shelter people and their families\u201d According to the MailOnline, the City Hall added on Tuesday evening: In total, more than 1,000 people under state care are currently sheltering in converted municipal facilities or gymnasiums, in addition to the care of more than 3,000 people with families.\u201d",

Zero children on the streets!'\nThe association has been distributing breakfast to the people who had slept outside the city hall as the numbers of migrants began to increase.\nWhile some migrants left for work or for meetings in the capital, nearly 150 people remained in the square on Friday. The number had increased to 230 people on Saturday morning.\nMigrants in a makeshift camp in front of the Paris City Hall wait for emergency accommodation in Paris, France, 11 August 2025\nNearly 200 migrants, mostly women, children and families, have been gathered on the square in front of the building since August 5 amid a protest organised by the Utopia56 association\nThe French based humanitarian association claims the move's aim is to find the migrants shelter while condemning the 'increasingly aggressive' expulsions taking place in France since its 2024 Olympic Games\n'We just finished distributing lunch, the temperatures are beginning to rise, and the most vulnerable people are already starting to suffer,' said Lequeux over the weekend.\nAmong the people present in the square, 'nearly half are children,' he said, with 90 minors present in total.\nOf the 90 children present, Utopia56 counted 'thirty children under the age of three'.\nOne family - Maria, her husband, and four-month-old daughter had been living on the streets for a month, reported AFP.\n'We've had more and more single women in recent months, sometimes between 70 and 90 per evening. Now, it's mostly families,' said Lequeux.\n'The numbers fluctuate and depend on how many people are end up on the streets.'\nThere were also 11 unaccompanied minors among the group of migrants on the square, some of whom were young females who had previously been housed by Utopia56.\nBut during the summer, the housing association loses two-thirds of its volunteers resulting in the closing of one of its main shelters, in Bagnolet, on the evening of August 5.\n'Half of our solidarity accommodation area is made up of citizen hosts and it's the same thing for volunteers, they are absent and go on vacation. As a result, we lose around 60 accommodation places every night,' Lequeux explained.\nThis lack of accommodation isn't spoken of 'as often in the summer as there are more children on the streets,' Eleonore Schmitt, a coordinator of the Collective of housing associations, told AFP.\nShe also blamed budget cuts. 'The elimination of 6,500 accommodation places for asylum seekers, passed in the 2025 Finance Law, is having an impact on the ground.'\nA spokesperson for Paris City Hall said that it continues to open 'centers in both summer and winter to shelter people and their families.'\n'In total, more than 1,000 people under state care are currently sheltering in converted municipal facilities or gymnasiums, in addition to the care of more than 3,000 people with families,' the city hall added Tuesday evening.\nImages from the scenes show migrants with blankets and their belongings in plastic shopping bags as they sit under blue tarpaulin sheets\nOf the 90 children present, Utopia56 counted 'thirty children under the age of three'\nDuring the summer, the housing association loses two-thirds of its volunteers resulting in the closing of one of its main shelters, in Bagnolet, on the evening of August 5\nA spokesperson for Paris City Hall said that it continues to open 'centers in both summer and winter to shelter people and their families'\nThe association has been distributing breakfast to the people who had slept outside the city hall as the numbers of migrants began to increase\nAfter nights in front of the town hall, wrapped in blankets and sleeping bags on the ground, the migrants, some of whom are legally resident in France, were seen shouting: 'We want housing!
