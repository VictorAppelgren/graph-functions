They plunked down $8,500 for each vending machine and then waited for the dispensers to throw off a steady stream of cash. Among those lured in was a product manager in Oregon in 2021 and then, several months later, a dentist in Illinois. Each bought dozens of water dispensers, which Wear's team would install and operate.",
