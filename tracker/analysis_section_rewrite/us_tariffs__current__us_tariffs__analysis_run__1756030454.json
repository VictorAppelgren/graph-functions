      "feedback": "Here’s concise, actionable feedback to elevate to world‑class quality: tighten the 0–3 week focus with a crisp causal chain from policy/news to market impact, then expose explicit catalysts, reaction function, and monitoring thresholds; anchor every claim to a source and replace broad platitudes with quantified linkages. Specific edits: 1) Reframe the narrative as (a) Immediate drivers/news/policy (tariffs framework, de minimis expiry, and short‑cycle supply shocks), (b) Near‑term catalysts and positioning dynamics (EU‑US framework implementation and auto‑tariff relief timing, India tariff cadence, Druzhba energy frictions, and chip supply‑chain shifts), and (c) Expected reaction function (pricing, shipments, margins, and capex signals) with explicit thresholds. Tie each element to sources: 15% MFN on most EU imports with carve‑outs and autos relief contingent on EU legislation (cite 9, 4, 10); de minimis expiry August 28 driving duty costs and paperwork (VCZKKPORO); 60–70% tariff pass‑through observed by Citi and tariff revenue as a near‑term offset to deficits (13, 19); Druzhba oil flow disruption as energy‑security tension (CWVWSACA7); near‑term semiconductor and supplier adjustments (11, 15, 27); DOE battery/EV manufacturing grants signaling U.S. domestic capacity build‑out (DNG58CC09, 3T8AGCL7T). 2) Build a tight, testable base case with crisp catalysts: e.g., if EU legislature is introduced and ground to enact the auto tariff relief this month, U.S. tariffs on autos could move toward relief within weeks (cite 9, 10); if not, keep 15% MFN on most EU goods with limited exemptions (cite 9). 3) Explicit invalidation points: a rapid EU legislative action that unlocks immediate auto-tariff relief would compress risk premia and support equities; a credible energy shock (Druzhba disruption widening) or a renewed tariff wave that raises effective rates above ~18–20% would widen spreads and invert the near‑term outlook (cite 13, 19, CWVWSACA7). 4) Quantify levels and thresholds: quote tariff ranges where possible (15% MFN; 50% India tariff looming on Aug 27; observed tariff pass‑through 60–70%; average tariff inflation could lift US import prices toward the high teens, per Citi and Yale/Budget Lab references); specify de minimis impact on 4 million daily shipments and duty costs rising for $800‑or‑less items (VCZKKPORO). 5) Strengthen the market‑transmission logic across sectors: semiconductor trade flows shifting toward Korea/China policy frictions (DGG6HXUFZ; 15), rare earth magnets normalizing exports (27), and battery‑materials domestic build‑out (3T8AGCL7T; DNG58CC09); mention Amkor packaging ecosystem (AMKR) as a near‑term proxy for capex cycle sensitivity (AMKR). 6) Improve structure and precision: replace generic “risk” language with scenario‑based bullets (base, upside, downside) and a single next‑week monitoring checklist (EU legislative status, auto‑tariff language status, Druzhba oil flows, chip‑supply signals, and DOE grant progress). 7) Citation hygiene and reconciliation: map every qualitative claim to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL and acknowledge conflicts, e.g., EU framework promises MFN 15% but preserves exemptions for certain products; autos relief depends on timely legislation (cite 9); energy and commodity flows may diverge from tariff trajectories (CWVWSACA7, DGG6HXUFZ, 27, 27). 8) Trim non‑essential details to fit horizon constraints and keep the prose tightly argued around near‑term price/volatility implications, not long‑term policy debates. The revised piece should read as: immediate drivers → near‑term catalysts/positioning → reaction function with levels/thresholds and explicit next‑step monitors, all underpinned by concrete numbers and direct source citations (CWVWSACA7; DNG58CC09; VCZKKPORO; DGG6HXUFZ; 3T8AGCL7T; AMKR; 11; 27; 9; 13; 19).",
