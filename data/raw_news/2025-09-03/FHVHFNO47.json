The PFS confirms Soto Norte as a high-quality project with robust economics, low operating costs, and industry-leading environmental and social design features. Importantly, the new study design reduces processing capacity to 3,500 tonnes per day (tpd) from 7,000+ tpd previously. The full PFS report is available on the Company's website and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca . All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\u2022 Initial capital of $625 million, including pre-production costs, value added tax (VAT) and contingency.\n\u2022 After-tax NPV of $2.7 billion, IRR of 35.4%, and payback in 2.3 years from the start of operations.\n\u2022 Low life-of-mine cash costs of $345/oz1 Au and all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) of $534/oz1 Au.\n\u2022 Annual EBITDA averaging $547 million over years 2 to 10 and $410 million over years 1 to 21.\n\u2022 Life-of-mine income tax and royalty contributions of $2.6 billion and $393 million, respectively.\n\u2022 Strong leverage to higher gold prices, at $3,200/oz the NPV increases to $3.6 billion with IRR of 42.1%.\n\u2022 Community Processing Capacity \u2013 750 tpd, or more than 20% of plant capacity, reserved to process material purchased from local community miners, providing a safe, regulated alternative that removes mercury use and ensures proper tailings and water management. Until Soto Norte's processing plant is operational, some material can be processed at Aris Mining's Segovia Operations or Marmato Complex.\n\u2022 Local Employment \u2013 Development of Soto Norte will generate significant employment across the municipalities of California, Surat\u00e1, and Matanza, and the wider Santander region. Peak construction will create about 2,300 jobs, with long-term operations sustaining about 675 direct employees. Aris Mining is preparing programs that will support growing local businesses, expand opportunities for women and young adults, and provide education and skills training.\n\u2022 Community Engagement Model \u2013 Aris Mining has implemented a structured engagement model with California, Surat\u00e1, and Matanza, built on social agreements that empower communities to identify priorities and propose initiatives. Through regular forums, the Project team ensures transparent dialogue, addresses concerns, and builds understanding. This model has delivered tangible social programs and is widely recognized as a successful approach to advancing sustainable regional development.\n\u2022 Water Protection and Water Improvement \u2013 The Project is designed to protect local watercourses. Extensive studies confirm that the shallow p\u00e1ramo waters are not connected to the deeper groundwater where mining is planned. To further limit interaction, advanced drilling and grouting will be used to identify and seal any water-bearing structures before mining activity, reducing potential groundwater inflows. Clean and contact water will be managed separately, treated before safe discharge to La Baja Creek, and recycled to minimize freshwater use.\n\u2022 Minimal Water Use \u2013 A recycling system allows 96.5% water reuse, resulting in a net water demand of only 2.8 litres per second (0.22% of the Surat\u00e1 River's flow at the intake point).\n\u2022 Surface Tailings Storage \u2013 Nearly half of the process tailings will be thickened and used as backfill underground, recovering most water and reducing surface storage requirements.\n\u2022 No Cyanide or Mercury \u2013 The processing facility will not use cyanide or mercury, eliminating two of the most harmful pollutants historically associated with gold mining in the region.\n\u2022 Environmentally Sound Operations \u2013 Ore will be transported from the portal to the plant via a rope conveyor having a minimal surface footprint, reducing truck traffic, dust, and spillage potential. Concentrates will be containerized and exported for international refining, avoiding local emissions or chemical residues. At the end of the mine life, the rope conveyor can be dismantled and removed. Mine closure and reclamation practices will follow international best practices, be incorporated into the mine design and will involve local communities during the design and development phase.\n\u2022 Filtered Tailings Facility \u2013 The facility design follows Canadian and International standards, which are globally recognized as best practice and provide detailed technical design and risk management criteria.\n\nA complete National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101) compliant Technical Report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report Prefeasibility Study for the Soto Norte Project, Santander, Colombia\" (the Technical Report) has been filed on SEDAR+ and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR, and is also available on the Company's website at https://aris-mining.com/operation/soto-norte/technical-report/\n\n1. Cash cost per ounce, and all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce are calculated inclusive of underground mining costs; treatment, transport and refining costs; processing surface costs; G&A and other costs; and are net of by-product credits for silver and copper. These metrics are calculated on a payable gold ounce basis.\n\n2. The PFS economic analysis excludes any contribution from the 750 tpd processing capacity dedicated to\n\n local community miners, which is intended to support regional formalization initiatives and environmental improvements.\n\nFounded in September 2022, Aris Mining was established with a vision to build a leading Latin America-focused gold mining company. Our strategy blends current production and cashflow generation with transformational growth driven by expansions of our operating assets, exploration and development projects. Aris Mining intends to unlock value through scale and diversification. The Company is listed on the TSX (ARIS) and the NYSE-A (ARMN) and is led by an experienced team with a track record of value creation, operational excellence, financial discipline and good corporate governance in the gold mining industry.\n\nAris Mining operates two underground gold mines in Colombia: the Segovia Operations and the Marmato Complex, which together produced 210,955 ounces of gold in 2024. With expansions underway, Aris Mining is targeting an annual production rate of more than 500,000 ounces of gold, following the commissioning of the second mill at Segovia, completed in June and ramping up during H2 2025, and the construction of the Bulk Mining Zone at the Marmato Complex, expected to start ramping up production in H2 2026. In addition, Aris Mining operates the 51% owned Soto Norte joint venture, where a PFS study is complete on a new, smaller scale development plan which confirms Soto Norte as a high-quality, long-life project with robust economics and industry-leading environmental and social design features. In Guyana, Aris Mining owns the Toroparu gold/copper project, where a new Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) is underway and its results are also expected in Q3 2025.\n\nColombia is rich in high-grade gold deposits and Aris Mining is actively pursuing partnerships with the Country's dynamic small-scale mining sector. With these partnerships, we enable safe, legal, and environmentally responsible operations that benefit both local communities and the industry.\n\nAdditional information on Aris Mining can be found at www.aris-mining.com, www.sedarplus.ca, and on www.sec.gov.\n\nThe Soto Norte Prefeasibility Study titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report Prefeasibility Study for the Soto Norte Project, Santander, Colombia\" was prepared in accordance with the NI 43-101 by the following Qualified Persons, all of whom are independent of Aris Mining for the purposes of NI 43-101:\n\nPamela De Mark, P.Geo., Senior Vice President Geology and Exploration of Aris Mining, is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, and has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release.\n\nCash costs ($ per oz sold), all-in sustaining costs ($ per oz sold) (AISC) and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios.

Our strategy blends current production and cashflow generation with transformational growth driven by expansions of our operating assets, exploration and development projects. Aris Mining intends to unlock value through scale and diversification. The Company is listed on the TSX (ARIS) and the NYSE-A (ARMN) and is led by an experienced team with a track record of value creation, operational excellence, financial discipline and good corporate governance in the gold mining industry.\nAris Mining operates two underground gold mines in Colombia: the Segovia Operations and the Marmato Complex, which together produced 210,955 ounces of gold in 2024. With expansions underway, Aris Mining is targeting an annual production rate of more than 500,000 ounces of gold, following the commissioning of the second mill at Segovia, completed in June and ramping up during H2 2025, and the construction of the Bulk Mining Zone at the Marmato Complex, expected to start ramping up production in H2 2026. In addition, Aris Mining operates the 51% owned Soto Norte joint venture, where a PFS study is complete on a new, smaller scale development plan which confirms Soto Norte as a high-quality, long-life project with robust economics and industry-leading environmental and social design features. In Guyana, Aris Mining owns the Toroparu gold/copper project, where a new Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) is underway and its results are also expected in Q3 2025.\nColombia is rich in high-grade gold deposits and Aris Mining is actively pursuing partnerships with the Country's dynamic small-scale mining sector. With these partnerships, we enable safe, legal, and environmentally responsible operations that benefit both local communities and the industry.\nAdditional information on Aris Mining can be found at www.aris-mining.com, www.sedarplus.ca, and on www.sec.gov.\nCautionary Language\nQualified Person and Technical Information\nThe Soto Norte Prefeasibility Study titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report Prefeasibility Study for the Soto Norte Project, Santander, Colombia\" was prepared in accordance with the NI 43-101 by the following Qualified Persons, all of whom are independent of Aris Mining for the purposes of NI 43-101:\n- Kate Kitchen, MAIG, Area Manager Geology, Mining Plus\n- Peter Lock, FAusIMM, Executive Director and Principal Mining Consultant, Mining Plus\n- Jan Eklund, P.E., Process Consultant, LogiProc Pty.
