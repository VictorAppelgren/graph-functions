  "title": "This Houston airline's summer involved deportation flights for ICE",
  "description": "Protesters have targeted the airline since the flights began.",
  "content": "Houston-based Avelo Airlines first started conducting federal deportation flights out of Arizona in mid-May. Now, an analysis of publicly available aviation data looks at Avelo's flight contributions for Immigration and Customs Enforcement so far.\n\nTom Cartwright, a refugee advocate with immigrant rights group Witness at the Border, has been tracking the activity through the ICE Flight Monitor. The monitor began mentioning Avelo after the airline signed an agreement for a long-term charter program flying domestic and international flights for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nCartwright's report notes that ICE Air does not disclose information or data about its flights. Still, the information is based on flight information from the publicly available FlightAware application, FlightRadar24, AirNav and the ADB-S tracking system. To identify the removal flights, Cartwright filters them to the likely ICE Air removal and destination locations, such as Guatemala and Honduras, which represented half of deportation flights in July. \"Any errors in our estimations, I believe, are small and certainly immaterial to the analysis,\" Cartwright says in the monitor, parts of which have been verified by reporters at the New York Times.\n\nAccording to Cartwright's May report, Avelo operated 116 flight legs, including five removal flights, representing 2.5 percent of all removal flights and 11 percent of total ICE Air flights for the half month they had been operating.\n\nAs the summer carried on, Cartwright's analysis found that June and July saw a similar mix of ICE Air charters by carrier. In July, GlobalX operated 50 percent of total flights, followed by Eastern Air Express at 24 percent, Avelo at 20 percent, and the military at 2 percent. Others and unallocated represent the rest.\n\nFor July removal flights, defined as a flight from a domestic ICE Air location to an international removal destination, GlobalX was listed at 56 percent, Eastern Air Express at 14 percent, Avelo at 10 percent, military at 9 percent, OMNI, Eastern, and Colombian Air Force each at 2 percent and all others and unallocated making up 5 percent.\n\nThe number of detainees on the flights is unknown, as the numbers aren't disclosed, and Cartwright notes there is no way to estimate. But regardless of the number of passengers, Avelo has faced ongoing protests and criticism over its DHS operations as President Donald Trump aims to carry out mass deportations.\n\nDeportations aside, domestic flights have garnered attention lately. As the Wall Street Journal reported, domestic flights by ICE\u2014including flights to detention centers and between facilities\u2014are higher now than they ever had been since Cartwright started documenting them in 2020. In July, there were 727 domestic legs. In comparison, the Biden administration saw an average of 350 per month.\n\nMeanwhile, other activists are putting pressure on Avelo. The Coalition to Stop Avelo calls the deportation flights \"cruel\" and \"inhumane,\" and recently cheered when the carrier announced its plans to close its base at Hollywood Burbank Airport. Ultimately, their mission is to convince Avelo to cancel its DHS contract or put the airline out of business through boycotts.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump came into office promising the largest mass deportation in U.S history, targeting the more than 10 million unauthorized migrants living in the United States. Since then, data shows border crossings have plummeted, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have doubled, and the number of people in detention is at an all-time high.\nNBC News is tracking immigration enforcement using ICE data both public and internal as well as data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. This page will be updated as new data is released.\nWhile the Trump administration has promised mass deportations, the number of people deported by ICE has not been regularly released to the public. NBC News has obtained internal ICE data on deportations which is reflected below.\nTrump administration officials say they are prioritizing the arrest and deportation of criminals, but ICE has made slow progress arresting the \"worst of the worst.\"ICE told Congress last year that, as of July, it had identified 435,000 unauthorized immigrants with criminal convictions in the United States who were not in custody. Of those non-citizens, 13,099 were convicted of murder and 15,811 were convicted of sexual assault. As of the end of May, 2025, ICE had arrested 752 non-citizens convicted of murder and 1,693 convicted of sexual assault.\nMeanwhile, data from Customs and Border Protection shows that unauthorized crossings at the southern border have plummeted."

      "text": "Every day, hundreds of immigrants arrive at this airport in Alexandria, La., and are marched along the tarmac in shackles and handcuffs.\nSome are loaded onto deportation flights to other countries.\nOthers are bused to a network of former jails and prisons across Louisiana.\nThe airport is the only hub of its kind in the country, with a 400-bed detention facility on the tarmac.\nIt\u2019s also at the center of a large-scale deportation operation, with eight other ICE detention facilities across the state.\nSince January, more than 40,000 people have been shuttled through this system \u2026\n\u2026 making Alexandria the deportation capital of America, and Louisiana a model for ICE\u2019s expansion.\nAlexandria International Airport has the feel of a small commercial airfield, with a shop selling coffee and snacks and panoramic windows overlooking the runways where a dozen American and Delta flights take off and land on a typical day.\nA few hundred yards from the passenger gates, though, is a far busier patch of tarmac. This is where Badar Khan Suri arrived on an afternoon in March.\nMr. Suri, an Indian citizen who has a visa to do research at Georgetown University, was marched off the plane in handcuffs and leg shackles and into a 70,000-square-foot detention center known officially as the \u201cAlexandria Staging Facility.\u201d\nThe State Department had sought the deportation of Mr. Suri, asserting that his presence in the country compromised \u201ca compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\u201d Mr. Suri\u2019s wife, a Palestinian American, had drawn the attention of pro-Israel activists for her sharp criticism of Israel on social media, and for her father\u2019s former role as a government official in Gaza.\nAnd so he found himself among thousands of foreign nationals flown to Alexandria, La., after being taken into federal custody as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sprawling immigration crackdown.\nNo airport has become more crucial to carrying out President Trump\u2019s pledge to deport millions of immigrants.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t even believe something like that can exist,\u201d Mr. Suri, 41, said in a recent interview, recalling days spent in windowless rooms with hundreds of men, disconnected from the outside world and not knowing where they would be taken next.\nSince the beginning of the second Trump administration, more than 21,000 people taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have passed through the Alexandria detention facility. More deportation flights have taken off from there than from any other place in the United States, and more domestic ICE flights have passed through there than anywhere else, according to a widely cited database of ICE flights. The database, verified by Times reporters, is maintained by Tom Cartwright, a refugee advocate with the immigrant rights group Witness at the Border.\nWith eight other detention centers within a hundred miles of Alexandria, and more detainees than any state but Texas, Louisiana has emerged as the busiest axis of the national deportation machine that the Trump administration has been trying to build at breakneck speed.\nTop ICE hub airports\n| Airport | Transfer flights | Deportation flights |\n|---|---|---|\n| Alexandria International Airport Alexandria, La. | 1,117 | 208 |\n| Valley International Airport Harlingen, Texas | 1,020 | 128 |\n| El Paso International Airport El Paso | 602 | 118 |\n| Mesa Gateway Airport Mesa, Ariz. | 499 | 5 |\n| San Antonio International Airport San Antonio | 450 | 4 |\n| Miami International Airport Miami | 261 | 24 |\n| Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport Vienna, Ohio | 155 | 6 |\n| San Diego International Airport San Diego | 118 | 32 |\n| Columbus Airport Columbus, Ga. | 141 | 2 |\n| George Bush Intercontinental Airport Houston | 96 | 24 |\nSince the 1980s, an immigration detention system has been growing in the state, backed by a succession of presidential administrations aiming to hold \u2014 and in many cases, expel \u2014 thousands of people who were in the country illegally.\nBut the scale of the system expanded enormously after Mr. Trump came into the White House in 2017 and pledged a major expansion of immigrant enforcement. A cluster of Louisiana jails and prisons, once the backbone of rural towns like the mills or factories of years past, were reborn as low-cost detention centers for ICE.\nMr. Trump reclaimed this system when he returned to the presidency, and his administration immediately put it into overdrive. With tens of billions of dollars in additional funding now directed toward ICE, Louisiana is at the leading edge of an expansive and aggressive nationwide effort to expel immigrants, far beyond the actions taken during the first Trump administration.\nIndeed, the airport hub, with its network of surrounding detention centers, is in many ways a template for what the head of ICE, Todd Lyons, has said the agency must become: a logistics juggernaut, like Amazon or FedEx, \u201cbut with human beings.\u201d\nThe credo that the government should be run like a corporation is not new, and ICE has for years contracted with private corrections companies and welcomed private-sector expertise, even hiring McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, for an organizational makeover. But the logistics operations behind this business-minded approach to detentions and deportations are now front and center.\n\u201cWe need to be better about removing those individuals who have been lawfully ordered out of the country in a safe, efficient manner,\u201d Mr. Lyons said in an April interview with a Boston news station, reiterating his belief that \u201cICE should be run like a corporation.\u201d But, he said, \u201cwe can\u2019t trade innovation and efficiency for how we treat the people in our custody.\u201d\nMr. Lyons wasn\u2019t the first ICE official to see FedEx as a model for immigration detentions and deportations. More than a decade earlier, before the airport detention center was even open, the ICE field office in New Orleans was patterning its system after FedEx \u2014 specifically, its hub-and-spoke model, in which FedEx packages are routed through its centralized Memphis hub, sorted and then distributed outward. People taken into ICE custody in Louisiana or one of four nearby states would be flown or bused to central Louisiana, and then sent on to whichever detention facility in the region had space.\nBut it was still expensive and complicated to carry out the last leg \u2014 deporting people. On a steakhouse cocktail napkin, as one ICE official would recall, a plan was sketched out. The Air Force base in Alexandria had shut down in 1992, and the state was looking to make use of the infrastructure beyond Alexandria International Airport, which opened on the site a year later. Why not build a detention center on the tarmac and put people on deportation flights right there?\nIn 2014, the Alexandria Staging Facility opened under the management of the private prison company Geo Group. There were marching bands and appearances from politicians, including then-U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who helped cut the ribbon.\nWith its 400 beds right next to a runway, the 72-hour holding facility is the only one of its kind, a matter of pride for ICE officials and local officials alike.\n\u201cImagine this as a hub: they go pick people up, bring them here and then sort them out,\u201d said Ralph Hennessy, the executive director of the economic development organization that oversees the former Air Force base property. He said in a recent interview that he understood there was controversy around ICE\u2019s ramped-up deportation efforts, but that the agency was simply carrying out the law. \u201cIt\u2019s got to happen somewhere,\u201d he said.\nThe Business of ICE Detention\nLouisiana locks up more people per capita than nearly any other U.S. state, and unlike other states, a majority of Louisiana\u2019s prisoners are held in local jails, with the state paying local sheriffs a daily rate per inmate. This can be lucrative, but managing jails is difficult. As the prison population grew in the 1990s and 2000s, some sheriffs began outsourcing state prisoners to private companies, including Geo Group and LaSalle Corrections.\nIn 2017, the state\u2019s governor, John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, successfully pushed through legislation aimed at reducing the prison population, and the number of state prisoners fell by more than 8,000 over the next five years.\nAt the same time, immigration arrests were ramping up sharply under the first Trump administration, and ICE needed thousands more beds. For private corrections companies in Louisiana, where the demand for state prison space was falling, this presented a new revenue opportunity at just the right time. The immigration crackdown was prompting resistance elsewhere, including bans in other states on privately run immigration detention centers, but in Louisiana, there was hardly any friction.\nThis remains true.\nWith cheap labor and real estate, the daily cost of holding an ICE detainee in the region is roughly a third of the average daily cost elsewhere. The highest court in the region \u2014 the federal appeals court based in New Orleans \u2014 is particularly Trump-friendly, and the state\u2019s top elected officials, all of whom are Republicans, have put up no opposition. In the rural parts of the state where the detention centers are, local officials from both parties welcome the jobs the centers bring. Immigration lawyers, however, point out that the remote locations of the centers mean meetings with clients require hours of driving.\nBetween 2016 and 2020, as jails and prisons around the state were repurposed into federal detention centers, the number of beds for ICE detainees in Louisiana more than tripled, and very little had to be built.\n\u201cSame private prison companies, a lot of the same staff, same infrastructure, same buildings,\u201d said Sarah Decker, a lawyer at the nonprofit organization Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights and a co-author of a 2024 report on Louisiana\u2019s detention centers.\nThe Richwood Correctional Center, which is managed by LaSalle Corrections, is one such local prison turned ICE detention center.\nOnce a farming community, Richwood, La., is a town of 3,800 people, many of them older and living on fixed incomes. When it housed state prisoners, the correctional center was a source of local employment and troubling headlines. In 2015, one inmate was killed by another, who in turn died after being beaten by corrections officers. In 2019, two supervisors pleaded guilty to a cover-up after officers lined up handcuffed inmates and pepper-sprayed them in the face. That same year, LaSalle entered a contract to hold a minimum of 677 immigrant detainees. Within months, a Cuban man being held in solitary confinement died by suicide.\nThe mayor of Richwood, Gerald Brown, a Democrat in a town where more than 90 percent of voters cast ballots for Kamala Harris, said he understood the concerns about immigrant detention. But he said the people running the Richwood facility became more engaged with the local community after the site transitioned to an ICE detention center, taking part in town parades and inviting him to visit the facility. The employees there earn significantly higher wages than before, he said.\nAnd the fees that LaSalle Corrections paid to the town to operate the prison more than tripled, to nearly half a million dollars annually. The detention center is now the largest source of annual revenue in Richwood\u2019s $1.7 million budget.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to invest a lot more in our police department,\u201d Mr. Brown said. The town hired more officers, bought more police cars and outfitted the vehicles with new technology. \u201cIt opened up a lot of things.\u201d\nAn Overcrowded System\nInside the Richwood facility, which is in the woods behind a neighborhood of modest homes, nearly 1,200 detainees from all over the world wait in limbo.\n\u201cWhen I arrived, we were like 50 people, but every day more and more people entered,\u201d said Adriana Mata S\u00e1nchez, 44, who was detained at Richwood for three months earlier this year. She had entered the country illegally from Mexico in 2001.\nPeople slept on double and triple bunks stacked so tight there was no room to sit upright. The lights turned off at midnight and back on again four hours later, with guards yelling for them to get up.\nThere were young women, mothers and grandmothers. At least one woman was pregnant. Some had been in the center for weeks, others for months. Some, like Ms. Mata S\u00e1nchez, were paid a dollar a shift to clean bathrooms or work in the kitchen. A Haitian woman she befriended would later die in a detention center in Florida.\nA native of Mexico, Ms. Mata S\u00e1nchez had been living near Fort Worth for more than two decades, working in meatpacking plants and raising a family. In February, she was pulled over by the police while traveling through Mississippi on her way to Atlanta and handed over to ICE. She was then driven to Richwood.\nLike many of the people in detention in Louisiana now, Ms. Mata S\u00e1nchez was arrested far from the southern border. For years, many of the detention centers were filled with asylum seekers taken into custody at or near the border. But with border crossings down since late in the Biden administration, the Trump administration\u2019s enforcement efforts have focused on detaining people in the interior of the country.\nMany have lived in the United States for years and have no criminal convictions. Some had been cited for traffic violations; others had missed paperwork deadlines. Some detainees, like Mr. Suri, the Georgetown researcher, appear to have drawn the administration\u2019s political disapproval. Many were arrested in places like Philadelphia, New York or Virginia and within days found themselves behind razor wire in rural Louisiana.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t realize where they\u2019re at,\u201d said David Rozas, an immigration attorney based in Baton Rouge, La.\nLawyers and federal oversight officials have criticized conditions inside the detention centers, highlighting poor medical care, widespread use of solitary confinement and physical abuse. In a 2023 government report, Richwood was cited for shortcomings in cleanliness and medical care; the average daily population at Richwood has increased nearly by half since mid-February and now exceeds 1,129, which was the maximum capacity when the report was written. In interviews, detainees said beds have been added in recent months.\nLaSalle Corrections, which operates the Richwood Correctional Center, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In public statements, the company has said its employees show compassion and concern for the people \u201centrusted to our care.\u201d\nFor most in detention in Louisiana, getting out is very difficult. Immigration judges in the region have historically granted asylum at some of the lowest rates in the country.\nIn the first few months of the year, judges had been releasing some detainees on bond. But this avenue is also narrowing: In early July, the Trump administration declared that all immigrants who entered the country illegally were ineligible for a bond hearing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a lot of people lose hope,\u201d said Christopher Kinnison, one of the few immigration lawyers based in Alexandria, La. \u201cICE has beaten them down so badly with the conditions of detention and just being stuck in prison for so many months that a lot of people, you know, they\u2019re giving up.\u201d\nMs. Mata S\u00e1nchez did not have a lawyer. She began to realize that she could spend many more months in detention before a scheduled hearing \u2014 and still be deported. Knowing that a voluntary departure could allow her to try to return legally, she asked a judge to leave the country. On May 9, she was flown to Texas through the Alexandria airport; the next day, she was driven to Mexico in a caravan of buses with other deportees.\nWhile lawyers in Louisiana lament that more and more clients are asking to leave the country rather than wait out the hearing process, the Department of Homeland Security has made it clear that is the desired outcome, running ads encouraging people to \u201cself-deport.\u201d\nFor the Trump administration, the solution to an increasingly crowded detention system is to build more detention facilities.\nThe policy bill that Mr. Trump signed on July 4 gives ICE $45 billion for new detention centers and the expansion of existing ones. The two largest private security companies, Geo Group and CoreCivic, already announced plans to add at least 6,000 more beds to existing facilities in several states and by converting former prisons or reopening idle facilities in Michigan, New Jersey, California and Texas.\nRecently, Florida, in coordination with ICE, began housing immigrants in a tent camp erected along an airstrip in the Everglades, naming it \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d In July, the government contracted to build a 5,000-bed facility in Texas that is expected to be similar to the operation in Alexandria.\n\u201cICE\u2019s goal is to swiftly remove aliens and keep them in ICE facilities for as short of a time as possible,\u201d a Homeland Security spokeswoman wrote in a statement. With the new funding, \u201cICE will be equipped with $14.4 billion for deportation flights to remove criminal illegal aliens.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Geo Group said \u201call persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.\u201d The company, the statement said, was \u201cready to continue to help the federal government meet its expanded immigration enforcement priorities.\u201d\nIn his days at the Alexandria Staging Facility, Mr. Suri recalled watching hundreds of men come and go every few hours. Officers would shout for everyone from a certain country, he said, and march them out en masse. Those who stayed behind, and those who were constantly arriving, remained in the dark about what was in store.\n\u201cAll the Guatemalans will leave in the morning, all the Nicaraguans will leave in the evening,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAll the Colombians have disappeared: Where are those people? Oh, all of the Colombians were removed at night.\u201d\nOn March 21, three days after his arrival in Louisiana, Mr. Suri was handcuffed and shackled, put in the back of a transport bus and driven alone to a detention center in Texas, where he slept on a plastic pallet in a common room. Fifty-four days later, a judge ordered he be released on bond. Mr. Suri\u2019s case drew attention from the news media and was taken up by the American Civil Liberties Union. The vast majority of those in detention do not get such support.\n\u201cI see those people, the uncertainty on their faces,\u201d Mr. Suri said. When people were waiting at Alexandria, he said, \u201cthey were nowhere. Nobody knew where they were.\u201d\nSources: The aerial image of the Alexandria airport was captured by Eagleview on Feb. 27.\nFlight paths are from Jan. 20 through June 30, 2025, and based on data provided by Tom Cartwright and verified by The New York Times and from ADS-B Exchange.

  "argos_summary": "Avelo Airlines began chartering ICE deportation flights in mid\u2011May, and a public\u2011data analysis by Tom Cartwright shows the carrier accounted for 2.5\u202f% of all removal flights and 11\u202f% of ICE Air flights in its first half\u2011month, rising to 20\u202f% of total ICE charters in July.  Cartwright\u2019s work, corroborated by New\u202fYork\u202fTimes reporters, also highlights that GlobalX and Eastern Air Express dominated July\u2019s removal flights, while domestic ICE flights surged to 727 legs\u2014double the average under Biden.  The article contrasts Avelo\u2019s role with broader ICE operations, noting Louisiana\u2019s Alexandria International Airport as the nation\u2019s busiest deportation hub, where private\u2011sector detention centers and a \u201chub\u2011and\u2011spoke\u201d logistics model have expanded under Trump\u2011era funding.  Activists, including the Coalition to Stop Avelo, criticize the airline\u2019s DHS contract and push for boycotts, reflecting growing opposition to mass deportation practices.",
