  "title": "The Cost Of Hardcore Culture: The Need To Balance Performance And People",
  "description": "Exploring the cost of hardcore corporate culture: balancing performance metrics with employee well-being for long-term success in today\u2019s workplace.",
  "content": "AT&T CEO, John Stankey, recently sent a headline making to employees, doubling down on the organization\u2019s return to office (RTO) policy and highlighting a transition away from a \u201cfamilial\u201d employer-employee relationship rooted in loyalty and tenure toward a culture of performance metrics and contribution. The memo also acknowledged a drop in overall employee engagement, despite a high percentage of workers who said they felt committed to their work. This memo brings up two important points leaders must consider.\n\nFirst, many companies have implemented or are still considering varying degrees of RTO mandates (including Disney, Google, & JPMorgan Chase, to name a few), arguing that working remotely harms company culture and values and reduces employee productivity. This stance has created significant tension between many workers and companies, with arguing back that they are more productive and efficient when working from home and enjoy better overall well-being. In addition, many leaders appear to discount or ignore the research about remote vs. hybrid vs. in-office work, which doesn\u2019t lend much support for their argument.\n\nIn fact, 80% of the more than 1,100 U.S.-based executives and workplace managers who responded to one survey said that had they had a more comprehensive of the data in this area, they would have taken a \u201cstarkly different\u201d approach to RTO plans. Almost 25% of the respondents admitted to making those decisions based on \u201cgut instinct.\u201d And as it turns out, many have decided to simply ignore the mandates.\n\nA detailed studying the impact of RTO mandates on the performance of 137 S&P 500 companies showed these key results:\n\u2022 RTO mandates did not significantly impact either company profitability or firm stock valuation; and\n\u2022 RTO mandates are more likely in companies with poor recent stock performance and in those with powerful male CEOs.\n\nSecond, CEOs consistently miss the financial power that gets generated when a people-focused approach is combined with a performance-focused approach at work. Recently, researchers used crowd-sourced from Indeed to examine the link between well-being and company performance. They looked at data from 1,636 publicly listed companies and measured employee well-being using the Indeed Work Well-Being Score, which looks at the dimensions of work happiness, purpose, stress, and job satisfaction. They discovered that well-being was a significant predictor of company performance across a variety of indicators. Specifically, the report found that higher levels of workforce well-being predicted:\n\nThey also found that higher levels of well-being are \u201cnot only predictive of contemporaneous company performance, but also of future firm performance.\u201d This is so because they found that well-being positively influences productivity, creativity, social relationships, health, recruitment, and retention.\n\nAnother report looked at 1,793 large companies across multiple industry sectors in 15 countries and found that who outperform on both financial results (what I call performance focused only companies below) and human capital development (what I call people focused only companies below):\n\u2022 Were 4.3 times more likely than the average company to maintain top-tier financial performance for 9 out of 10 years from 2010-2019\n\u2022 From 2019-2021, they grew their revenues 2x faster than performance focused only companies (8% vs 4%)\n\u2022 Had a lower attrition rate (8.5%) compared to the performance focused only companies (13.4%) and typical performers (13.5%), though slightly higher than the people focused only companies (7.9%)\n\u2022 Had returns on invested capital equal to the performance focused only companies (both 28%), but far better than the people focused only companies (9%) and the typical performers (6%)\n\u2022 Greater economic profit ($1.1B) compared to the performance focused only companies ($0.4B).\n\nThe performance focused only companies remind me of many of the law firms and professional services firms generally with whom I have worked, and they certainly sound like the type of culture Stankey seeks to drive. They are very goal-oriented, top-down, and challenging environments, with a near myopic focus on financial performance. Many leaders in performance focused only companies have pressed me directly as to why they should change since clearly model is making them money. As the report details, financial performance alone paints an incomplete picture. Performance focused only companies experience more \u201cbumps in the road\u201d getting to the same destination compared to companies that prioritize people and performance. Specifically, \u201cWhere trends are in their favor, [performance focused only]\n\ncompanies seem to be able to capture the upside well, but in periods of uncertainty, they lack the stability of the companies [that amplify people and performance equally]. Not prioritizing human capital development seems to increase the exposure of performance focused [only] companies to volatility and risk in turbulent times.\u201d\n\nTaking a performance focus in your organization is OK as long as you also create a culture of value and significance for your people. These are what employees consistently report as critically important to their work:\n\u2022 Being valued by my manager;\n\u2022 Being valued by my organization;\n\nLeaders often underprioritize these factors, and it shows. Nearly 50% of report not feeling valued at work and only 24% of people think their employer cares about their well-being. John Stankey will likely see the outcomes he wants in the short term. People will comply because they need a job, and those who are able to will leave. It\u2019s a great opportunity for forward-thinking companies to scoop up top talent. But what will the cost be to the organization long-term in asserting control rather than investing in trust? Only time will tell.\n\nis the CEO of the Stress and Resilience Institute and is the of the newly released book, Lead Well: 5 Mindsets to Engage, Retain, & Inspire Your Team.",

      "text": "Why aren\u2019t workers particularly appreciating\u2014much less adhering to\u2014return-to-office mandates? Probably because adults don\u2019t like being ordered around.\n\u201cPeople do want structure, and people like boundaries,\u201d former Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell last year. \u201cBut they don\u2019t like to be told what to do, so I think the secret is to not make them feel like their autonomy is being denied or that their ideas aren\u2019t important, while still giving some structure.\u201d\nIf only managers had taken the hint. Four in five (80%) of bosses told workplace software firm Envoy that had they had a better grasp on their workplace data, they would have taken a starkly different approach to their return-to-office plans. The problem, they said: They didn\u2019t have access to data that would help them make their decision. In a white paper report, Envoy surveyed 1,156 U.S.-based executives and workplace managers whose employees operate on some form of hybrid schedule.\nOver half (54%) of managers told Envoy they\u2019ve had to forgo making a critical decision about the workplace because they lacked the requisite data to support it. Without that data, nearly a quarter of them admit to making decisions based on \u201cgut instinct,\u201d which naturally leads to resentment and disappointment. Fifty-seven percent of bosses said if they had better access to data, they could better measure the success of their in-office policies.\nOne such example is Amazon, whose RTO plan was admittedly prompted by the feelings of senior leadership, not hard data. \u201cIt\u2019s time to disagree and commit. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re back\u2014it\u2019s working,\u201d Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, reportedly said of in-person work. \u201cI don\u2019t have data to back it up, but I know it\u2019s better.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to ascertain just how effective in-person days are compared to at-home days, especially when actual productivity could vary based on any number of factors not necessarily related to location. It\u2019s even harder for companies who operate on an ad hoc basis, letting individual teams decide for themselves when to come in. Though experts speak highly of this kind of \u201corganized hybrid,\u201d it can be difficult to assess its effectiveness at a company level. \u201cWith so much variability, it\u2019s difficult to know how to improve efficiency in order to save critical budget,\u201d Brooks Gooding, a workplace experience program manager at a software firm called Braze, said in the report.\nBraze operates on a hybrid plan with little consistency in attendance rates, which, as Envoy wrote, can make it \u201cimpossible for workplace managers to know how many people are on-site on any given day, and how to best allocate space and resources across the organization.\u201d\nThe RTO mismatch\nEnvoy\u2019s data lays bare a fundamental mismatch that\u2019s endured since the earliest days of the pandemic: Most bosses would rather have their workers where they can see them. Most workers demand a bit more latitude than that.\nGranted, there are solid arguments for both time spent in the office and time spent on the couch. On one hand, remote work is proven to be between 10% and 20% less productive and can weaken morale and bonding, especially among younger workers and new workforce entrants. But people still overwhelmingly prefer at least a few days per week at home, arguing that physical office presence is more trouble than it\u2019s worth and is rarely necessary to complete a task.\nIdeally, a mix of both options\u2014at the workers\u2019 discretion\u2014should fix the problem. Workers are flocking to jobs with flexibility, which has quickly become a must-have for most white-collar industries rather than a nice-to-have.\nBut many bosses are getting impatient, and many are using the approaching Labor Day holiday as an occasion to officially put \u201cwork from anywhere\u201d policies to bed, whether workers like it or not. Alongside the usual suspects (like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs), those even include formerly quite lenient companies, like Meta, Google, and Salesforce.\nDespite the fact that remote workers make more money and have fewer expenses, lower stress levels, and more time for family and errands, the office isn\u2019t likely to disappear. In fact, workers can even be excited by the prospect\u2014if they think it\u2019s their idea. Data from Unispace found that a third of workers felt \u201chappy, motivated, and excited\u201d about an office return, but felt none of those things when the return was mandated.\nAs Atlassian\u2019s Annie Dean put it, productivity, innovation, and creativity are \u201chow-to-work problems, not where-to-work problems,\u201d which will be solved only by an overhaul of how we understand work.\n\u201cThis is a watershed moment of innovation of how work gets done,\u201d Dean told Fortune, \u201cbut we\u2019re still talking about the f\u2013king watercooler.\u201d"

The survey results represent more than 99,000 employees, which is 73% of the company.\nAT&T told BI that the company had no additional comments on Stankey's memo because it \"speaks for itself.\"\n\"We run a dynamic, customer-facing business, tackling large-scale, challenging initiatives,\" Stankey wrote. \"If the requirements dictated by this dynamic do not align to your personal desires, you have every right to find a career opportunity that is suitable to your aspirations and needs.\"\n\"That said, if a self-directed, virtual, or hybrid work schedule is essential for you to manage your career aspirations and life challenges, you will have a difficult time aligning your priorities with those of the company and the culture we aim to establish,\" Stankey added.\nAT&T has undergone a series of changes this year, starting with replacing a hybrid schedule with a five-day in-office mandate. Some AT&T employees previously told BI that it became difficult to obtain office desks and parking spaces amid the RTO push, while the telecom's rival Verizon saw the office mandate as an opportunity to recruit AT&T workers interested in hybrid schedules."
