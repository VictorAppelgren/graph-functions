      "title": "Trump may want you to pay a high tariff for that French wine you enjoy so much. He just left the category blank in his deal sheet with the EU",
      "summary": "The U.S. and EU reached a provisional trade framework that sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods, while keeping U.S. cars tariff‑free and carving out exemptions for aircraft, certain pharmaceuticals and other strategic products. Wine and spirits remain subject to the 15% rate, and steel tariff‑rate quotas are still under negotiation. The deal includes non‑binding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion in the U.S., and it aims to avert a broader trade war amid Trump’s broader tariff push on 66 countries. However, many details—such as the exact scope of exemptions and the implementation timeline—remain to be finalized, and the broader U.S. tariff regime continues to face legal challenges and economic uncertainty for consumers and businesses.",
