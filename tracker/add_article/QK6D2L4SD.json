      "summary": "French Prime Minister François Bayrou faces a looming confidence vote that could force his resignation within a week. Opposition parties, notably the Socialist and National Rally parties, have pledged to vote against him, leaving his survival unlikely unless they abstain. If he loses, President Emmanuel Macron could appoint a new prime minister or call for new elections, though the latter is deemed unlikely after a poor outcome last year. Macron has ruled out resigning himself, making a new prime minister the most probable outcome.",
