      "summary": "European equity indices were broadly higher, while bond markets calmed after a recent rout, with U.S. and Eurozone yields easing as investors anticipate potential Fed rate cuts following weak U.S. labor data.  The market is closely watching Thursday’s ADP private payrolls and weekly jobless claims, which could reinforce expectations of September rate cuts and support the dollar’s seasonal strength.  Commodity prices fell on OPEC+ output concerns, but gold remained near‑record highs on expectations of a September U.S. rate cut and rising tariff‑related costs.",
