  "title": "Family of Ex-OpenAI Researcher Turn to Crypto to Fund Disputed Death Probe",
  "description": "Supporters of late AI critic Suchir Balaji have turned to crypto to back his family\u2019s legal fight using Solana-based meme coins.",
  "content": "The family of a former OpenAI researcher found dead in his San Francisco apartment in November 2024 is using Solana-based meme coins to help finance their legal battle with the city.\n\nWhile the medical examiner ruled Suchir Balaji's death a suicide and found no evidence of foul play, Balaji\u2019s parents have rejected that conclusion, calling the scene \u201cstaged\u201d and have launched their own investigation into what they allege was a botched and allegedly covered-up probe.\n\nBalaji, who had publicly criticized OpenAI for allegedly training ChatGPT on copyrighted material without permission, had been an outspoken figure in the AI ethics debate.\n\nAfter his death, supporters in the crypto community rallied to the family\u2019s cause, seeing it as both a justice issue and a fight against institutional opacity.\n\nIn December, a family friend launched the Justice for Suchir (SUCHIR) token on the Bags.FM meme coin platform with a total supply of 999 million tokens.\n\nThe coin briefly peaked at $0.015 on December 29, according to CoinMarketCap, generating $5,000 for the family.\n\nLike many meme coins, it has since crashed 99% from its all-time high.\n\nThat effort followed a January 2025 crypto fundraiser that brought in over $140,000 in Solana and other tokens.\n\n\u201cIt was overwhelming because we are running out of resources,\u201d Balaji\u2019s mother, Poornima Ramarao, told Decrypt. \u201cFunding through crypto is a great idea\u2014it allows us to keep going when other options have stalled.\u201d\n\nThe Solana wallet that received $140,000 hasn\u2019t received a donation since April, according to SolScan, but the wallet linked to the meme coin is still drawing funds.\n\nRamarao has apparently not been able to retain a lawyer who will take the case on contingency.\n\nOne lawyer, who after racking up $25,000 in hourly fees, said he was \u201ctoo busy\u201d to continue pursuing the case, Romarao said.\n\nA second lawyer has charged her $60,0000 thus far. She said she spent another $115,000 on fees related to an investigation.\n\nIn February, the family filed a lawsuit against the City of San Francisco and the SFPD, alleging that investigators withheld records and failed to investigate the case properly.\n\n\u201cVery few investigators know how to get the truth out,\u201d Ramarao said. \u201cThis makes it more expensive.\u201d",

      "text": "Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old ex-employee of OpenAI who went public with allegations that the company unethically used data to train its artificial intelligence platform, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment in an apparent suicide, according to a report by Techcrunch.\nBalaji worked as a researcher for the OpenAI technical staff from November 2020 to August 2024. He made headlines in an interview with the New York Times when he said he helped OpenAI use enormous amounts of data gathered from the Internet to train ChatGPT without permission, leading up to its public launch in November 2022. Among other allegations, the Times reported that the company created its own transcription software, which it ran on YouTube to harvest data.\n\u201cI initially didn't know much about copyright, fair use, etc., but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits filed against GenAI companies,\u201d Balaji posted on X in October. \u201cWhen I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually came to the conclusion that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they're trained on.\u201d\nLast December, The Times sued OpenAI for copyright infringement. During an interview at the New York Times annual Dealbook Summit, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman maintained that his company did nothing wrong and said the newspaper was \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d\nIan Crosby, Susman Godfrey partner and lead counsel for The New York Times told Decrypt that Altman misunderstands copyright law:\"What he misses is that's precisely why copyright law exists, and there\u2019s a way to build new technologies that complies with the law and the rights of copyright holders,\" Crosby said. \"History has repeatedly shown that it is entirely possible to do both.\"\nAccording to authorities, Balaji was found dead in his apartment on November 26 after police and medical personnel were called to his home to do a wellness check. \u201cThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) has identified the decedent as Suchir Balaji, 26, of San Francisco,\" the ME's office said in a statement. \"The manner of death has been determined to be suicide.\u201d\n\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d a spokesperson from OpenAI said in a statement."

      "text": "The mother of the late Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI employee turned whistleblower, has raised over $140,000 worth of cryptocurrency to fuel an independent investigation after she claims her son didn\u2019t die by suicide.\nBalaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment in November, with authorities determining the manner of death to be suicide. However, his mother Poornima Ramarao disputes this conclusion, immediately launching a campaign for a \"comprehensive investigation\" into her son\u2019s death.\n\u201cWe are the parents of happy, smart, and brave young man Suchir,\u201d Ramarao posted on X (formerly known as Twitter). \u201cHis time of death is [a] few hours after his last call with family. We don\u2019t understand, within [a] few hours, what happened does not align with his happy mood and return from vacation.\u201d\nBalaji worked as a researcher at OpenAI from November 2020 to August 2024, before going to the New York Times to make a litany of allegations against the company as a whistleblower, claiming the AI giant was breaking copyright laws.\nTwo weeks after his death, Ramarao claims to have hired a private investigator to carry out a second autopsy. This investigator did not come to the same cause of death as the police, instead finding signs of struggle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cold-blooded murder,\u201d Ramarao posted on X. \u201cWe demand [an] FBI investigation.\u201d\nIndependent journalist George Webb later released a video, against the will of the family, showing himself walking around Balaji\u2019s apartment that is still covered in blood. In this video, he points out what he believes to be evidence that the former OpenAI employee did not die by suicide.\nAs the family\u2019s conviction grew, they claimed to have signed a retainer with an attorney. With help from the team behind Solana token Justice For Suchir (SUCHIR), Ramarao set up a Solana wallet and posted it on X, asking for donations to fund $100,000 in legal fees.\nNow three days later, the wallet holds over $140,000 in Solana (SOL) and a basket of other Suchir-inspired meme coins on the chain. The team behind the aforementioned SUCHIR token, the largest of the tokens dedicated to the whistleblower, claims to be working directly with the family to amplify the message.\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to bring awareness and help fundraise,\u201d a spokesperson for Justice for Suchir told Decrypt.\nDecrypt also reached out to Ramarao directly, but did not immediately receive a response.\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\nGenerally Intelligent Newsletter\nA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model."

      "text": "The parents of deceased OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji have sued the city of San Francisco and the San Francisco Police Department, alleging that the real cause of his death was not suicide, but murder.\nThe lawsuit, filed in January, alleges that the SFPD covered up the crime, ruling it a suicide without conducting a thorough investigation.\nBalaji, who had worked as a researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment last November. Attorneys say Balaji\u2019s parents, Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy, requested further investigation into his death but were told the case was already closed.\n\u201cThe lawsuit demands that the city, police department, and medical examiner release public documents withheld under the Public Records Act,\u201d Joseph Goethals, attorney for the petitioners, told Decrypt. He said that if the documents weren\u2019t provided within 10 days, and \u201cno valid exceptions apply, a lawsuit can compel their release. We will seek a court order to obtain them.\u201d\nThe lawsuit claims that SFPD violated the California Public Records Act by unlawfully withholding public records of the case. Attorneys for Ramarao and Ramamurthy also argued that the investigation into their son\u2019s death was rushed and inadequate, with officials ignoring key forensic findings and failing to address their requests for further inquiry.\nThe lawsuit demands the immediate disclosure of all reports, photos, and videos, along with coverage of legal costs.\nSaid Geothals: \u201cIf the San Francisco Superior Court does not interpret and impose the law correctly, we will seek recourse with the Court of Appeal. We hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d\nBalaji worked for OpenAI from November 2020 to August 2024. In an interview with The New York Times in October, he said that before the public launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, he had helped OpenAI gather and use \u201cenormous amounts\u201d of data taken from the internet without permission.\nAccording to the lawsuit, in December, Balaji\u2019s family hired forensic pathologist Dr. Joseph Cohen to perform a private autopsy. In his report, Dr. Cohen determined that there was a single gunshot wound in the mid-forehead, slightly to the right of the bridge of his nose.\nDr. Cohen said that the bullet trajectory was unusual for a suicide, as it traveled downward at a slight left-to-right angle, completely missing the brain before lodging in the brainstem, according to the suit. Dr. Cohen identified a contusion on the back of Balaji\u2019s head, which he said raised further questions about the circumstances of his death.\nThe San Francisco Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Decrypt.\nThe lawsuit called out the circumstances of Bilaji\u2019s death. His body was found a week after The New York Times mentioned the whistleblower in a court filing related to its lawsuit against OpenAI.\nDespite Balaji\u2019s revelations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pushed back on the New York Times\u2019 claims. Speaking at the newspaper\u2019s annual DealBook Summit, Altman dismissed the allegations. He further claimed that the publication's lawsuit against OpenAI over use of its materials to train AI models put the paper on the \"wrong side of history.\"\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"
