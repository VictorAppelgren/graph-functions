PETERSBURG, FL, August 14, 2025 (EZ Newswire) -- Wealth Express , a consumer-first financial solutions platform committed to providing transparency and trust in financial services, today announced the launch of its latest solution: Wealth Express Term Life Insurance with Guaranteed Pricing . This new offering was created to restore confidence for families who have experienced deceptive digital pricing practices, such as bait-and-switch life insurance quotes.\n\nFixing the Trust Gap in Digital Life Insurance\n\nWith the rise of algorithm-driven life insurance platforms, many families are lured in by attractively low quotes \u2014 only to be approved at rates nearly double the original estimate. This \"bait-and-switch\" model, often marketed as digital convenience, leaves many feeling misled and unprotected.\n\nWealth Express's new life insurance solution offers:\n\n\u201cFamilies shouldn\u2019t be forced to choose between fair pricing and convenience,\u201d said Rob Graham, co-founder of Wealth Express. \u201cOur life insurance solution removes the guesswork, eliminates surprise price hikes and puts a human advisor back into the equation \u2014 because financial protection should build trust, not erode it.\u201d\n\nThe solution is specifically designed for working parents aged 35 to 50 who want to protect their families without being taken advantage of by hidden fees, digital bait-and-switch tactics or inflated \u201cconvenience\u201d markups.\n\nNo More \"Convenience Tax\"\n\nAccording to internal research, many digital platforms charge up to 50% more for the same level of life insurance coverage, simply because they bypass traditional exams.
