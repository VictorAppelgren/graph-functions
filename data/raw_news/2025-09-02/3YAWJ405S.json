  "description": "The One UI 8 beta arrived on the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy A phones yesterday. Now, it's time for the Z Fold 5 and Flip 5 to get in on the action.",
  "content": "Samsung has just brought the One UI 8 beta to the Galaxy S23 series and a few other phones. However, there\u2019s good news if you\u2019ve got a Galaxy Z Fold 5 or Galaxy Z Flip 5 and were waiting for the beta software.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5 owners on Samsung\u2019s Korean-language Community forum (h/t: Tarun Vats) have confirmed the availability of the One UI 8 beta. Check out a couple of screenshots below.\n\nThe first screenshot above shows that you\u2019re looking at a hefty update in excess of 3GB. So you should definitely use Wi-Fi if you\u2019re not on an unlimited data plan.\n\nThere\u2019s no word on a release timeline for Galaxy Z5 owners in other locales. Nevertheless, this initial availability suggests that an expanded release isn\u2019t far away. So you might have to wait a few days to see it in your market.\n\nThe rollout also comes after Samsung promised to release the stable version of One UI 8 this month. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S25 series to be first in line for the stable update.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe best Samsung phones: High-end, mid-range, and entry-level models\nFebruary 8, 2025\nSamsung has been the king of the Android world for years now, and the South Korean giant\u2019s lineup of phones has something for everyone. When deciding the best Samsung phone for you, there are a few things to consider:\n- How far can you stretch your budget?\n- How important is camera performance?\n- Will you use your Samsung phone for gaming or demanding apps?\n- What form factor do you want? Small? Large? Folding?\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what\u2019s important to you, we\u2019ve done the hard work for you. We\u2019ve tested and reviewed literally every Samsung phone on the market, boiling down the options to just six phones. If you want some more insight, check out our detailed buyer\u2019s guide to learn more.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is the best Samsung phone for most people\nNaturally, you\u2019d assume that paying big bucks should award the best phone, but that\u2019s not necessarily true. Look no further than the Galaxy S25 Plus for proof. The middle S25 model is one of the best Android phones you can buy, combining all the best parts of the Galaxy S24 Plus with a price tag that\u2019s much easier to approach than its Ultra-branded sibling.\nThis year, buyers everywhere get the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, specifically tweaked for Samsung\u2019s purposes, and all models are mated to 12GB of RAM \u2014 plenty of juice for apps and games \u2014 and up to 512GB of internal storage. Also, Samsung\u2019s latest Dynamic AMOLED panel is excellent, as always, with the Galaxy S25 Plus sporting a 6.7-inch 120Hz panel. Samsung has also further chiseled away at the phone\u2019s bezels so that it won\u2019t dent your pocket any more than its predecessor, though the sharp, flat frame might not be very comfortable for small hands.\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus also comes preciously close to its largest sibling in terms of battery capacity, landing at 4,900mAh. That\u2019s only a sliver smaller than the Ultra model, which should give the Plus healthy longevity between charges. There\u2019s still no official Qi2 charging from magnets in the Galaxy S25 Plus itself, but you can grab a magnetic case for some level of MagSafe support.\nSamsung\u2019s other big drawcard is its camera hardware, but you\u2019ll have to look long and hard to find any notable upgrades over the outgoing model. The 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto zoom cameras are still here, and they all continue to perform admirably. More interestingly, Samsung has added even more AI-powered capture tools to the bag, including a smart color adjustment system and the ability to cut video clips into a highlight reel automatically.\nOther positives include Samsung\u2019s top-notch software support. The Galaxy S25 Plus offers a seven-year Android update promise, dishing out new One UI builds well into the next decade. Notably, this is a feature across the entire Galaxy S25 series, so don\u2019t make this your primary reason for buying.\nThe best camera phone from Samsung is the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It offers a 200MP main camera, a 50MP ultrawide, a 50MP 5x telephoto, and a 10MP 3x telephoto sensor.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Battery, buffed: The 4,900mAh reservoir is nearly as large as the Ultra\u2019s.\n- Versatile cameras: The tried and tested triple-camera setup is great for almost any situation.\n- Great performance: All buyers can enjoy the pacey Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, along with 12GB of RAM.\n- Gorgeous display: The slightly larger, brighter, and crisp AMOLED screen is easily visible outside, even on sunny days.\n- Software promise: Android manufacturers are taking software updates seriously, and the Galaxy S25 series is the first to benefit.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G offers unbeatable mid-range value\nWe\u2019d recommend the Galaxy A55 ($387 at Amazon) in other regions of the world, but it\u2019s not coming to the US. However, the Galaxy A35 is an admirable and capable mid-range alternative.\nUp front, the phone features a vibrant 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a slathering or Gorilla Glass Victus Plus. Despite its mostly plastic construction, this should give the Galaxy A35 great scratch resistance.\nAt the rear, the phone\u2019s camera array gives it a similar appearance to its more premium siblings, especially the Galaxy S24. It houses a 50MP primary camera, which produces pleasing results in bright and lower light. Color reproduction is another positive, while the lack of motion blur when snapping moving objects is a big surprise. However, the 8MP ultrawide and 5MP macro cameras feel less refined.\nNevertheless, you\u2019ll be soothed by the phone\u2019s excellent battery endurance. With its Exynos 1380 and a 5,000mAh battery, the Galaxy A35 can go well beyond a day with regular use. Once it does run out, you can recharge it at up to 25W with the correct charger.\nThere\u2019s not much to dislike about the Galaxy A35, but the lack of Galaxy AI features may be a sticking point for potential buyers. Additionally, the lack of wireless charging is understandable but unfortunate.\nNevertheless, the Galaxy A35 is the best mid-range Samsung you can purchase in the US. If you live in Europe or India, the Galaxy A55 is a better, albeit pricier, purchase.\nGenerally, most Samsung phones have excellent battery life. But if you were looking for a device that offers a good balance between cost and longevity, the Galaxy A54 5G or Galaxy A35 5G are good choices. Alternatively, the Galaxy S24 Plus is the longest-lasting flagship, according to our tests.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Flagship design: The Galaxy A35 looks so much like its premium siblings that you won\u2019t mind its plastic frame.\n- Great battery life: The Galaxy A35 should last well over a day and a half, even without battery-saving mode enabled.\n- Solid update commitment: Four years of Android version updates and an extra year of security updates are admirable for a mid-range model.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is the power user\u2019s dream phone\nThis is the most powerful Samsung smartphone you can buy, but it won\u2019t necessarily be the best for most people. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a phone for power users who want everything in a handset, bar a foldable display \u2014 though it hasn\u2019t changed too much from its predecessor.\nIn total, the Galaxy S24 Ultra has five cameras. The rear four are headlined by a 200MP main and two telephoto cameras with 50MP 5x zoom and 10MP 3x zoom capabilities, respectively, but most of the love has gone to a new 50MP ultrawide sensor with a shallower depth of field for better light capture. At the front, you\u2019ll find the same 12MP selfie camera used on the last few Ultras. We do have to admit that we miss the 10x telephoto sensor just a little bit, though.\nNevertheless, other things will keep you occupied, including the S Pen tucked away in its dedicated slot, the copious 5,000mAh battery, and the now completely flat 6.8-inch AMOLED screen. Just keep in mind that a phone this large comes with a titanium frame to match, so it\u2019s going to be tough to hold in smaller hands.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Integrated S Pen: If you use it, this can be a game-changer for productivity. Or Candy Crush. Your call.\n- Revamped design: Gone are the rounded sides, but the result is a Galaxy S25 Ultra that looks more like its siblings.\n- Gorgeous screen: The S25 Ultra screen is gorgeous and flat, making S Pen use even more enjoyable.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the best foldable for most people\nFoldable phones are steadily coming into their own, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no exception. It might not be as big of a change as its predecessor, but it raises the Galaxy AI experience in several ways. If you\u2019ve been eyeing a foldable for your next phone, the much larger Flex Window is back again, and it still comes with some of the best widgets you\u2019ll find on a flip phone.\nThe biggest selling point here is still the form factor. Samsung\u2019s clamshell foldable phone still fits comfortably into a pocket (at least most pockets) and opens up to reveal a 6.7-inch AMOLED display. Unfortunately, it still isn\u2019t quite as bright or crisp as a traditional display, but Samsung inches closer and closer every year. However, it\u2019s not as wide as a normal smartphone, which makes it much easier to use with one hand. Of course, the real selling point for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the Flex Window, which looks and feels a lot like the cover screen on the Motorola Razr Plus \u2014 even if it\u2019s not as large. You\u2019ll have to install Good Lock for most app experiences, but then you can open everything from Instagram to Strava on the 3.4-inch panel.\nSamsung has also upgraded the software features that you can tap into on the Flex Window with a brand-new Auto Zoom mode for the dual cameras. Essentially, it uses Galaxy AI to track you, the subject, through the field of view, automatically adjusting the zoom from 0.5x up to 3x for a more convenient selfie.\nSpeaking of the camera, the Z Flip 6 is certainly a capable shooter, and it finally has a new primary sensor. Samsung swapped the previous 12.5MP primary camera for a new 50MP version, once again paired with a 12MP ultrawide camera to fit more in your frame. The setup does serve as a great selfie alternative, though. Apart from group selfies using the Flex Mode, the screen on the front can also serve as a viewfinder, which allows you to take selfies with larger, more capable external cameras.\nApart from that, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a great little phone \u2014 even if I didn\u2019t expect to like it at first. Performance is stellar thanks to the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy. Battery life is about the same as its predecessor, which makes sense when you pair the upgraded processor with a more demanding cover display. It\u2019s still limited compared to traditional phones, but it\u2019s enough for a typical day. It took a little over an hour to charge while plugged in or an hour and a half wirelessly. Once again, though, there\u2019s no charger in the box.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Flex Window: Samsung\u2019s larger cover screen allows for much more in-depth app experiences and better widgets.\n- Very pocketable: The small size fits easily in pockets and purses and is great for one-handed use.\n- Premium materials: Samsung\u2019s combination of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is as tough as they come.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the best tablet replacement\nWhile the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a productivity powerhouse, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 takes things to the next level by unfolding into a bright, sharp, 120Hz 7.6-inch tablet. To sweeten the deal, the interior screen is compatible with an S Pen, although there isn\u2019t one included in the box. However, unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung\u2019s book-style foldable has a few new design upgrades to mention\nThe large interior screen is obviously the big selling point here, but the rest of the phone is top-notch, too. Samsung finally squared off the external display, making it feel a bit larger and wider for use when closed. This year\u2019s cameras are about the same as the previous setup, once again rolling with a 50MP primary camera, 10MP telephoto, and a 12MP ultrawide for good measure. The interior screen has an under-display camera to minimize its visual impact, but it has remained essentially unchanged since Samsung introduced it a few years back.\nOn the performance side, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy is more than powerful enough for smooth and consistent performance on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, even on the larger screen. Battery life is once again good enough but not incredible, mostly due to the additional display real estate and relatively small 4,400mAh cell. It took nearly an hour and a half to charge the Galaxy Z Fold 5 from dead to full, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 once again tops out at 25W wired speeds.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- It folds: The phone opens into a very nice 7.6-inch tablet.\n- S Pen compatibility: Get even more out of your phone with an S Pen (sold separately).\n- Great software: Android 14 has been optimized for larger devices, providing a much better experience.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE offers affordable flagship performance\nSamsung\u2019s Fan Edition family has been on an interesting journey. After landing among the best phones of the year with the Galaxy S20 FE, the follow-up Galaxy S21 FE felt like a case of too little, too late. Now, Samsung is back to recapture some of its early success with yet another mid-ranger, the Galaxy S24 FE. On the surface, it follows the Fan Edition formula to the letter, but under the hood, it delivers much, much more.\nFor starters, the Galaxy S24 FE certainly looks the part. It\u2019s almost identical to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus, swapping frosted rear glass for a glossy panel but otherwise matching the refined design language. The Galaxy S24 FE\u2019s 6.7-inch AMOLED panel stands much larger than its smallest flagship cousin, offering plenty of real estate for games or streaming. This year, the phone is also sandwiched with panes of Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the front and back \u2014 a sizable upgrade over the previous Gorilla Glass 5.\nOf course, in order for Samsung to keep the Galaxy S24 FE more affordable than its proper flagship lineup, there are a few sacrifices under the hood. It swaps the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy for the in-house Exynos 2400e pairs it with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Both the RAM and storage are in line with what we expect for the money, though the drop from a Snapdragon chipset to an Exynos one isn\u2019t as steep as some might have guessed.\nUltimately, the Galaxy S24 FE comes in as one of Samsung\u2019s best offerings. It\u2019s a better value than its predecessor, while also giving its flagship family members a run for their money thanks to its price point of under $700. You might have to get used to slightly less flexible cameras, but we\u2019d say they\u2019re worth it.\nBefore you rush out to pick one up, however, Samsung recently announced the Galaxy S24 FE. It\u2019s slightly larger than this model and comes with an Exynos processor standard across the board. We\u2019re still in the process of reviewing Samsung\u2019s latest mid-range offering, and we\u2019ll be sure to update this entry with our thoughts as soon as we finish our testing.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- High-end style: The Galaxy S24 FE picks up right where Samsung\u2019s flagships left off, pairing glossy front and back panels with a squared-off frame.\n- Flexible cameras: A classic wide/ultrawide/telephoto trio means the Galaxy S24 FE packs a wide zoom range and offers support for Expert RAW without the flagship price tag, though you\u2019ll be missing a few megapixels.\n- Updated connectivity: The Galaxy S24 FE supports modern standards, including Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6e, and NFC for mobile payments.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is great for people on a tight budget\nFinally, we have the best Samsung phone for those on a budget. The Galaxy A15 5G is a step up from the Galaxy A14 it replaces, and bags an excellent 6.5-inch 90Hz AMOLED screen, a MediaTek Dimensity 6100 Plus SoC, and a 5,000mAh battery with 25W charging.\nIt also includes a capable 50MP main camera, which is dragged down by its 5MP ultrawide and 2MP macro companions. Most cheap Samsung phones have underwhelming cameras, and all three have problems. However, it\u2019s a reasonable performer for its price.\nYes, the Galaxy A15 is on the lower end of Samsung\u2019s spectrum, but it\u2019s a great smartphone for the money. Perhaps the best part of the Galaxy A14 is its price, which should keep your wallet happy.\nWhat makes it stand out\n- Incredible value: The sub-$200 price tag is just right.\n- Great battery life: This phone is a true battery champion thanks to its low power hardware.\n- Headphone jack: Yes, Samsung still has one or two models with a headphone jack in 2024.\nWhat we look for in the best Samsung phones\nWe\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of Android phones over the years here at Android Authority, so we\u2019ve developed a keen eye for what you look for in a smartphone. If you\u2019re thinking of picking up a Samsung phone specifically, here\u2019s what to look for:\nLook for value\nIt\u2019s tempting to jump right for the most expensive Galaxy S25 Ultra or Z Fold 6, but these phones offer much more than most users will ever need. For that reason, we recommend the S25 Plus from the premium lineup since it hits the best price-to-performance ratio. Likewise for budget devices like the A25 5G and A35 5G.\nConsistent software\nSamsung phones all use the company\u2019s in-house One UI software, which is a slightly tweaked version of Android with extra features. They also all offer four years of version updates and five years of security updates, so even the cheapest phones will remain up to date for a long time. However, phones on the low end will show their age much sooner.\nVersatile cameras\nNowadays, megapixel counts don\u2019t mean nearly as much as software smarts, but Samsung phones are generally great performers. They all tend towards heavier saturation in photos, for better or worse. However, rather than looking for high MP counts, we recommend looking for phones with dedicated ultrawide and telephoto lenses where possible. The added versatility is a big plus in your mobile photography kit.\nBuild materials and design\nPrice is generally the deciding factor in how good a phone\u2019s build quality is, but there are a few things to look out for. For example, Gorilla Glass Victus and Gorilla Armor are much more resistant than Gorilla Glass 5, although you\u2019ll still probably want to get a case if you want it to last. Camera housings are another contentious issue design-wise, but if you are going to get a case, you won\u2019t even notice it.\nOther FAQs\nSamsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S25 series offers the best mix of performance and discounts heading into the first few months of 2025. Some people may also prefer the cutting-edge design of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6, and the midrange Galaxy A series is impressive without the high cost.\nThe Galaxy A35 is perhaps the best value you can get in a Samsung phone right now. It offers three rear cameras, a large 5,000mAh battery, and a solid 6.6-inch Full HD Plus display for just $399.\nIt\u2019s tough to find a better value than ordering from Samsung itself. Amazon may offer faster shipping, but the Samsung website usually offers the best trade-in values and additional perks. For example, the Galaxy S25 series offered pre-order benefits that included double storage and $50 off for those who reserved their phone.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is among the best budget phones you can buy. It offers a large, crisp display, 5G speeds, and a powerful triple-camera setup for $399.\nThe best Samsung phone for seniors is the Samsung Galaxy Folder 2. It\u2019s an affordable flip phone with a 3.8-inch screen, rear and selfie cameras, and a keyboard.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nIt's official: More Galaxy devices will soon get One UI 8\nAugust 5, 2025\n- Samsung is expanding its One UI 8 beta program to include devices such as the Galaxy S24 series, Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 in select regions starting next week.\n- The beta will be available by the following month for older flagship and mid-range models, such as the Galaxy S23 series and various A-series phones.\n- Stable releases of One UI 8 will start rolling out wider from September onward, while One UI 8 Watch is on track for wider rollout later in the year.\nSamsung took its sweet time rolling out One UI 7 to its device lineup. One UI 8 was off to a better start, but users have started getting impatient as days stretch into weeks with no new info. Only the new Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and Galaxy Z Flip FE have stable One UI 8, while the relatively still-new Galaxy S25 series has One UI 8 betas. Finally, Samsung is ready to announce the next phase of One UI 8 expansion, as it has shared details on the rollout of the beta and stable update to more devices.\nSamsung has announced the expansion of its One UI 8 beta program. Starting next week, One UI 8 betas will be available for the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy Z Flip 6 in India, Korea, the UK, and the US.\nIn the following month, the One UI 8 beta program will roll out to even more devices, including the Galaxy S23 series, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy A36 5G, Galaxy A55 5G, Galaxy A35 5G, and Galaxy A54.\nFurther, starting in September, One UI 8 stable will expand to more Galaxy devices beyond the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. Samsung didn\u2019t mention which devices, but it\u2019s easy to guess that the rollout will likely start with the Galaxy S25 series.\nLater in the year, One UI 8 Watch will also expand its availability beyond the Galaxy Watch 8 series.\nFor One UI 8 betas on eligible phones, interested users will have to sign up for the beta program via the Samsung Members app. Once you install the app and sign in with your Samsung account, you will see a One UI 8 Beta Program banner on the home page, which you need to click on and complete your registration. Once done, you can check for an impending update at Settings > Software update > Download and Install. We\u2019ll keep you updated once the betas begin to roll out next week.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nSamsung Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra: Release date, pricing, colors, and everything else!\nJuly 16, 2025\nYou can\u2019t get a year started without a fleet of Samsung\u2019s best new smartphones, bringing together the hottest hardware advancements, most impressive AI features, and the latest and greatest edition of One UI.\nLet\u2019s not waste any time, as there is a ton you\u2019ll want to know about the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. Here we go!\nVastly improved software\n7 years of support\n12GB RAM\n7 years software support\nBig battery\n7 years software support\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: Release date, price, and availability\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 (12/128GB): $799.99\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus (12/256GB): $999.99\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (12/256GB): $1,299.99\nSamsung formally introduced the Galaxy S25 series at its first Unpacked of the year on January 22, 2025 \u2014 and just like last time around, hosted the event in San Jose, California. Following the pre-reservation period that could score you a $50 credit, pre-orders for the phones opened as Unpacked concluded. General retail availability got underway on February 7.\nApproaching this generation of Galaxy flagships after a year when seemingly everything got more expensive, we were curious if Samsung would leave pricing unchanged, or take advantage of inflationary trends to push prices to a new extreme. As it turns out, we had nothing to worry about, and Samsung came back with the same pricing breakdown we saw last year. That means the Galaxy S25 starts at $799, and the Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999. Those two have maintained that position for years and, with a little luck, will for at least a few more to come.\nWhile Samsung raised pricing for its highest-end flagship model with last year\u2019s S24 Ultra, it looks like the company has managed to get that urge out of its system, and the S25 Ultra also comes back this year at the same $1,299 level.\nWith microSD expansion having gone the way of the dodo, you\u2019ll want to make sure you pick up a Galaxy S25 model equipped with all the storage you\u2019ll need, not just for today and tomorrow, but for the next seven years of Android updates you\u2019ll be getting. Here\u2019s what your options look like:\nSamsung Galaxy S25:\n- 12GB/128GB: $799, \u00a3799\n- 12GB/256GB: $859, \u00a3859\n- 12GB/512GB: \u00a3959\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Plus:\n- 12GB/256GB: $999, \u00a3999\n- 12GB/512GB: $1,119, \u00a31,099\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra:\n- 12GB/256GB: $1,299, \u00a31,249\n- 12GB/512GB: $1,419, \u00a31,349\n- 12GB/1TB: $1659, \u00a31,549\nSamsung is selling the Galaxy S25 in markets all around the world, from the United States, to the United Kingdom, to the company\u2019s own South Korea. What\u2019s special this year is that we\u2019re not seeing a split between the choice of processor across markets. That said, the availability of different storage configurations may vary depending on where you live.\nFor instance, in the US, Samsung won\u2019t be selling the 512GB storage model of the standard Galaxy S25; the highest storage you can get on it will be 256GB. Similarly, you won\u2019t be able to pick up an S25 Plus with 1TB storage in the US, but you might have that variant available in other countries.\nWhile in the past Samsung has brought Snapdragon-powered Galaxy models to markets like the US, you\u2019d find Samsung-produced Exynos chips in Galaxy flagships in many international markets. That\u2019s not the case in 2025, and all Galaxy S25 phones run the custom Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.\nWhen it comes to buying a Galaxy S25, carriers can offer some fantastic deals, but the best spot for getting your order in is often directly with Samsung itself. That gets you access to not only some unique promo offers, but is also the only place you\u2019ll find the S25 Ultra in its Jetblack colorway.\nHow much storage are you choosing for your Galaxy S25 phone?\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: Specs\nWe\u2019ve already let the cat out of the bag when it comes to a couple of the biggest shifts in hardware with this year\u2019s Galaxy S models, as Samsung bumps base RAM up to 12GB for the Galaxy S25 and commits to Snapdragons all around with its processors. But there\u2019s just a bit more than that going on here, so peruse this table at your convenience for all the details.\n| Specs | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Specs Display | Samsung Galaxy S25 6.2-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 6.9-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate |\n| Specs Processor | Samsung Galaxy S25 Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm) |\n| Specs Main Camera | Samsung Galaxy S25 50MP Wide AF OIS 12MP Ultrawide 10MP 3x Tele AF OIS | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 50MP Wide AF OIS 12MP Ultrawide 10MP 3x Tele AF OIS | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 200MP Wide AF OIS 50MP Wide AF OIS 10MP 3x Tele AF OIS 50MP 5x Tele AF OIS |\n| Specs Selfie Camera | Samsung Galaxy S25 12MP Wide AF | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 12MP Wide AF | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 12MP Wide AF |\n| Specs Memory and Storage | Samsung Galaxy S25 12GB RAM | 128GB, 256GB Storage | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 12GB RAM | 256GB, 512GB Storage | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 12GB RAM | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Storage |\n| Specs Battery | Samsung Galaxy S25 4,000mAh | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 4,900mAh | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 5,000mAh |\n| Specs Charging | Samsung Galaxy S25 Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare |\n| Specs Connectivity | Samsung Galaxy S25 5G (sub6, mmW) Wi-Fi 7 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 5G (sub6, mmW) Wi-Fi 7 UWB | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 5G (sub6, mmW) Wi-Fi 7 UWB |\n| Specs Biometrics | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultrasonic Fingerprint, Face Recognition | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Ultrasonic Fingerprint, Face Recognition | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Ultrasonic Fingerprint, Face Recognition |\n| Specs Dimensions | Samsung Galaxy S25 70.5 x 146.9 x 7.2 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 75.8 x 158.4 x 7.3 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 77.6 x 162.8 x 8.2 |\n| Specs Weight | Samsung Galaxy S25 162g | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus 190g | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 218g |\n| Specs OS | Samsung Galaxy S25 Android 15 / One UI 7 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Android 15 / One UI 7 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Android 15 / One UI 7 |\n| Specs Durability | Samsung Galaxy S25 IP68 Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 Armor Aluminum (Frame) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus IP68 Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 Armor Aluminum (Frame) | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra IP68 Enhanced Corning Gorilla Armor (front glass) Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (rear glass) Titanium (Frame) |\n| Specs Colors | Samsung Galaxy S25 Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, Titan Whitesilver |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: Features\nWatching Samsung work on the One UI 7 beta ahead of the S25\u2019s release, we already knew a lot about new features coming to Galaxy smartphones, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. As the latest flagship line, the Galaxy S25 series isn\u2019t just equipped with some solid hardware upgrades, but picks up some noteworthy software enhancements and exclusives in the process. These are the highlights you\u2019re absolutely going to want to check out:\nCamera\nOnce again, Samsung saves its best camera package for its premium model, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra delivers with its quad-camera array, including a 200MP main camera and the return of the 50MP periscope telephoto option we saw debut with the Galaxy S24 Ultra. But even with those specs lining up, we still get new hardware here, like a 50MP ultrawide angle (UWA) lens.\nSome of the improvements in this generation might be a little subtle, but Samsung is definitely upping its game behind the scenes. That includes upgrades like increasing HDR fidelity from 8-bit to 10-bit, and cleaner macro performance due to less sensor crop. Another one you may feel more than you consciously notice is a big reduction in shutter lag.\nCamera hardware takes a back seat this generation, but the Ultra still manages to steal the show.\nSamsung is also bringing a spatio-temporal filter to its cameras, which is supposed to make it easier for these phones to distinguish between still and moving image elements. We\u2019re also seeing that same system used to enhance portrait mode performance. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this feature is available via the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip rather than being a Samsung-exclusive option. So other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones should benefit from this imaging tech as well.\nFor its smaller phones, Samsung\u2019s not delivering any surprises, and the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus end up as camera twins for another year. Sadly, neither of these two pick up the Ultra\u2019s new UWA camera. All three phones return with a 12MP front-facing camera; if it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it?\nPerformance\nWith the introduction of the Galaxy S23 a couple of years back, Samsung broke from tradition and, rather than splitting markets between S23 phones built with Snapdragon and Exynos processors, chose to go Snapdragon across the board. While the S24 was a return to that division, the S25 brings us back to a unified Qualcomm landscape, and every S25 model around the world will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.\nSamsung and Qualcomm have a close working relationship, and that \u201cfor Galaxy\u201d label should be all the hint you need that there are some special changes going on under the hood here. Compared to off-the-shelf Snapdragon 8 Elite components, the Galaxy S25 series silicon has been overclocked for even speedier performance.\nNo matter where you purchase your Galaxy S25 this year, you can count on Snapdragon 8 Elite performance.\nOne particular area where these Snapdragon 8 Elite chips are getting some extra attention is their image signal processor (ISP), which has been heavily modified for Samsung\u2019s needs.\nSamsung says this year\u2019s phones can deliver 37% more CPU performance and offer a 30% faster GPU than last year\u2019s Galaxy S24 models. We tested the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy in the Galaxy S25 series shortly after launch, so what did we discover? Well, the processor offers improved CPU performance compared to the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite, but similar GPU performance.\nThe other nice performance upgrade concerns the baby Galaxy S25. The cheapest Galaxy S24 only shipped with 8GB of RAM, while the S24 Plus and S24 Ultra had 12GB of RAM. Fortunately, all Galaxy S25 series models (including the vanilla model) have at least 12GB of RAM.\nWill you miss the Exynos version of the Galaxy S25?\nDisplay\nSamsung\u2019s not taking its flagship Android line back to the drawing board, and the look and feel of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra just carry the S24\u2019s influence into a new generation. While there\u2019s plenty that\u2019s evolving in 2025, there are also a lot of places where Samsung has already gotten to the point where it wants its phones to be \u2014 and that includes some display details. But even as the base Galaxy S25 and the S25 Plus keep their 6.2- and 6.7-inch screen sizes, respectively, the S25 Ultra moves from 6.8 to 6.9 inches.\nDespite that size increase, the phone itself shouldn\u2019t feel any larger than the S24 Ultra, thanks to smaller bezels that allow Samsung to squeeze more display real estate into hardware that\u2019s the same size.\nSamsung taps Corning for screen protection once again, giving the S25 and S25 Plus the same Gorilla Glass Victus 2 we saw with last year\u2019s models. The S24 Ultra helped introduce us to Corning\u2019s advanced Gorilla Armor, and we had heard to expect an upgraded version this time around. Sure enough, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is our first chance to experience second-generation Gorilla Armor, claiming a 40% improvement in durability.\nConsidering how the original Gorilla Armor saw Samsung dealing with a 60% decrease in service requests for screen damage compared to the S23 Ultra, we can only imagine how that might continue to drop off in the years to come. In addition to the strength improvements, Corning has also upgraded its anti-reflection coating for optimum visibility in all kinds of conditions.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nIt really feels like this year is one of subtle refinement for Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S series, and while some fans will be disappointed to not see the company taking a bolder approach to design, those who have been craving a few targeted improvements may find a lot to appreciate here.\nEven as the overall look of the S25 series largely mirrors that of S24 phones, the Ultra model more closely aligns with its smaller siblings as it adopts curved corners this year. That seems like it\u2019s a further step away from the idea of the Ultra as a Note replacement \u2014 and honestly, this change is just going to feel a whole lot less pokey in our pockets.\nThe silhouettes of our S25 trio don\u2019t diverge much from their S24 predecessors, but all three have gone on a diet, and weigh in noticeably less than last time around. While the S24 series tipped the scales at 168, 197, and 233 grams, the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra only come in at 162, 190, and 218 grams, respectively. With the Ultra particularly, that\u2019s an immediately obvious improvement, and the phone feels stunningly light from the moment you pick it up.\nThere\u2019s also a decrease in thickness across the board, though on a scale of fractions of millimeters. All three S25 phones should be reasonably well equipped to resist environmental damage, with IP68 ratings and metal frames \u2014 aluminum for the S25 and Plus, and titanium on the Ultra.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of blue-ish, metallic shades, boy does Samsung have just the lineup of colorways for you. The Galaxy S25 gets us started with four main colors: Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow. Those are the same four options you have with the Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung\u2019s giving both these phones access to the same online exclusive colors if you order direct from the manufacturer: Blueblack, Coral Red, and Pinkgold.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra gets its own selection of colors, but these don\u2019t come across as hugely distinct from the rest of these silvery hues. You have your choice of Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, and Titan Whitesilver. Titanium Pinkgold, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Jadegreen are available via Samsung\u2019s website. Did you remember that the S25 Ultra has a titanium frame? Samsung seems afraid you\u2019ll forget.\nEspecially with these online-exclusive colors available at Samsung.com, the company tends to limit availability to specific markets, so you probably won\u2019t have your choice of all of them. You\u2019re definitely going to want to check out Samsung\u2019s site in your own country to get an accurate look at the options available to you.\nWhat do you think of Samsung's Galaxy S25 series color options?\nBattery life and charging\nNo matter how flashy a new phone is, it\u2019s no good to anyone with a dead battery, and power endurance continues to be a major concern for smartphone buyers everywhere.\nWith phone hardware that doesn\u2019t make any major size changes compared to last year, it shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that we\u2019re looking at the same battery capacities across the lineup. That spells a 4,000mAh battery for the Galaxy S25, the return of a nice, big 4,900mAh component for the Galaxy S25 Plus, and the S25 Ultra going with the same 5,000mAh battery size these models have used since time immemorial.\nGalaxy S25 phones will work with a magnetic Qi2 charger \u2014 if you pick up the right case.\nWe\u2019re also not seeing any changes when it comes to charging speed. With the Galaxy S25, that means that you\u2019re going to top out at using the phone with a 25W charging adapter. For the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra, you can go as high as 45W \u2014 just keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to pick up a compatible phone charger to take full advantage.\nIt looked hopeful for a moment that we might score some upgrades this generation in terms of wireless charging, maybe even getting 25W support, but we\u2019re stuck with the same 15W wireless maximum. There are also no magnets built into any of the Galaxy S25 models for Qi2 support. Samsung has worked with case manufacturers to make sure that third-party options that add magnets will align precisely with Samsung\u2019s charging coils, but that\u2019s hardly the graceful solution we craved.\nAll three Galaxy S25 phones support Wireless PowerShare for fueling your other devices in a pinch.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra S Pen\nSamsung\u2019s active stylus solution has long been a big selling point for Galaxy flagships, with the Note having passed the torch to Galaxy S Ultra models. But while past years have pushed limits in terms of S Pen functionality and ergonomics, Samsung\u2019s priorities have begun to shift with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThe big change this year is that Samsung is dropping support for the S Pen\u2019s Bluetooth functionality. This means losing access to Air Control and a host of other Bluetooth-connected features. This isn\u2019t just about the Ultra\u2019s built-in S Pen, either, and even if you bring your own S Pen Pro, the phone won\u2019t connect to it over Bluetooth. That\u2019s a bummer, but Samsung says that not enough users were taking advantage of the support to justify keeping it.\nIt\u2019s not all a wash, though, and Samsung has tweaked the way the S Pen docks in the Ultra to feel more flush this time around. On the downside, that can make getting it out a little more difficult, but we\u2019re sure a lot of owners will still appreciate this.\nOne UI 7: Software and updates\nSamsung already set a high bar for itself last year when it matched Google to offer seven years of software support for the Galaxy S24 series. That practice is only set to continue with its new Galaxy S25 phones, and all three of these models will get seven years of security updates as well as seven years of new Android releases. Sure, most of us are going to upgrade our handsets long before we even get close to that cutoff, but we are still so grateful to see manufacturers like Samsung even giving us the option to keep using devices for this long.\nOne UI 7 may be Samsung's most anticipated release in years, and it debuts with the Galaxy S25.\nGoogle\u2019s rollout of Android 15 was a little weird in 2024, and even the company\u2019s own Pixel 9 phones arrived without it. Samsung got its own public beta program going much later than we\u2019re used to, inviting owners of Galaxy S24 phones to help test One UI 7. The company wrapped up One UI 7 testing ahead of the Galaxy S25\u2019s launch, making this Samsung\u2019s first hardware to debut with Android 15 and this latest incarnation of the company\u2019s skin.\nThe Galaxy S24 already showed Samsung\u2019s clear investment in AI-powered features, and it\u2019s only doubling down on that commitment with One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25. That includes some big changes, like Gemini rising to join Bixby as your AI assistant tag team. That can\u2019t have been an easy decision for Samsung, but is one that\u2019s probably going to be the best for Galaxy S25 users.\nGemini is only a taste of all the AI functionality Samsung has prioritized with the Galaxy S25 and One UI 7, so let\u2019s get right into what you can look forward to.\nGalaxy AI features\nOnce again, Samsung is back with Galaxy AI branding to summarize all the AI-fueled features you\u2019ll find on its flagship phones, including those cooked up in-house and those that tap into Google\u2019s own AI prowess. While some hardware upgrades this generation are only available on the company\u2019s highest-end Ultra model, we\u2019re happy to see that there\u2019s no such exclusivity when it comes to Galaxy AI, and these features are available across the entire Galaxy S25 lineup.\nBetween the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip claiming a 40% boost in NPU performance for AI tasks, and Samsung\u2019s move to give all its S25 phones 12GB of RAM, this series is better equipped than ever before for doing some seriously advanced AI number crunching right on your phone. But just like we\u2019ve seen in the past, other Galaxy AI features are going to tap into the cloud for a little extra help.\nHere are just a few of the Galaxy AI features you\u2019ll find in each of those categories.\nOn-device you\u2019ll find things like AI Select, Writing Assist, Call Summary, Read Aloud, and this pair of \u201cNow\u201d tools:\n- Now Brief: Remember Google Now back in the day? Google\u2019s old service could offer you a summary of your day. Samsung\u2019s Now Brief feels a lot like a modern reincarnation of this tool, keeping you updated throughout the day with information it thinks you\u2019ll find useful.\n- Now Bar: You can think of the Now Bar as a companion to Now Brief, bringing you that same kind of daily content but condensed down into a bite-sized chunk that lives at the bottom of your lock screen.\nCloud-based functionality includes Draw Assist, Sticker Generation, and some Google stuff like Gemini Live and one recently enhanced favorite:\n- Circle to Search: This Google-created feature gets an upgrade with the launch of the Galaxy S25, as AI Overviews come to Circle to Search. Google was already leaning hard on AI to recognize the on-screen elements you\u2019re trying to search, and this expands that usage to also quickly give you a summary of the best information it was able to find. Other tweaks include recognizing phone numbers and URLs.\n- Draw Assist: Galaxy AI uses a combination of text you write, images you upload, or just a quick sketch you throw together to help generate synthesized artwork.\nThere are also a number of Galaxy AI features that straddle both sides of this line, with both on-device and cloud support. Just like we\u2019ve seen Samsung do before, the Galaxy S25 series gives you control over which of these AI tools you want active on your device. Especially with cloud-based features, if you\u2019re uncomfortable with the idea of your data being exposed, you can always opt to have your phone just act like they don\u2019t even exist.\nProVisual Engine\nWhile Galaxy AI represents the flashy tools stealing all the spotlight, lots of Samsung fans come back year after year for the company\u2019s reliable camera performance, with a ton of powerful features all wrapped up in the ProVisual Engine banner. With the S25 series, Samsung is only giving those users more of what they love.\nHere are only some of the new capabilities you\u2019ll find from the ProVisual Engine on top of everything Samsung\u2019s bringing back from past generations:\n- 10-bit HDR: We already touched on this one, but making 10-bit the new default bit depth for HDR means that Samsung\u2019s able to squeeze significantly more dynamic range into the photos the Galaxy S25 phones shoot. That should especially be noticeable in low-light conditions, where Samsung really says the S25 shines.\n- Audio Eraser: Like Google\u2019s Audio Magic Eraser, Samsung has implemented its own tool for cleaning up the audio from video recordings. The system identifies the different components making up the sound in your footage, letting you selectively isolate things like voices, music, and crowd noise. Then, you can adjust the levels on all those individually to get the perfect balance.\n- Galaxy Log: Professionals who lean on the flexibility of Samsung\u2019s pro video mode can now access tools for accurate color grading, with the help of exclusive lookup tables.\n- Virtual Aperture: A physically varying aperture allows cameras to instantly change characteristics like depth of field, but smartphones rarely offer such flexibility. With the Galaxy S25, Samsung\u2019s Expert Raw app will try to achieve the next best thing, letting you simulate the same sort of effect during the editing process.\nWhat did we think of the Galaxy S25 series?\nWe reviewed all three Galaxy S25 series phones shortly after their release. Starting with the Galaxy S25 Ultra review, colleague Ryan Haines called it the company\u2019s \u201cmost impressive flagship to date\u201d as well as its \u201cleast exciting Ultra phone ever.\u201d Ryan praised the build quality, battery life, cameras, performance, display, and update policy. However, he also lamented the downgraded S Pen, lack of Qi2 support, the largely AI-based upgrades, the less-than-ergonomic design, and the expensive price.\nMeanwhile, colleague C Scott Brown reviewed the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus. He felt that Samsung forgot about these phones, pointing to the lack of significant camera upgrades, charging/battery upgrades, and design changes. However, Scott also praised the phones for their performance, new Galaxy AI features, premium build quality, and long update policy. He concluded by saying you\u2019re generally better off saving some cash and buying the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus.\nFAQ\nNo, none of the S25 phones include a microSD card slot. This is not something Samsung has offered on the Galaxy S series in years.\nThe Galaxy S25 phones all support Qi-standard wireless charging at 15W. While they will work with a MagSafe charger, they do not include built-in magnets to hold the charger in place. You can add that support, though, with the help of a compatible case.\nWhile these phones are very similar to the last generation, between the new shape for the Ultra and thinner builds all around, you\u2019ll need to pick up a new case.\nAll Galaxy S25 models support a single physical nano-SIM and allow you to install an eSIM profile. While both of those can be present at once, there\u2019s no option for dual physical SIM cards.\nMuch like support for microSD card storage expansion, the analog headphone jack is one blast from the past that you should not count on making a return. If you want to use wired headphones with the Galaxy S25, consider USB-C headphones or pairing them with an adapter.\nThank you for being part of our community.
