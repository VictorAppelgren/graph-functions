  "description": "Here\u2019s when to use a personal loan to pay for private school.",
  "content": "\u2022 Personal loans can help you pay for your child\u2019s K-12 private school, but average rates are relatively high.\n\u2022 Before using a personal loan to cover tuition, make sure to exhaust gift aid options like scholarships and grants.\n\u2022 If you decide to borrow a personal loan, compare rates and terms from multiple lenders to find the most affordable option. Private school is expensive. With costs that can run over $15,000 annually , that adds up quickly, especially if you have multiple children. If you find yourself struggling to pay tuition, you might consider a personal loan to bridge the gap, but whether that makes sense depends on a lot of variables in your specific situation. If you find yourself struggling to pay tuition, you might consider a personal loan to bridge the gap, but whether that makes sense depends on a lot of factors. Learn more: What credit score is needed for a personal loan? The best personal loan rates in 2025 If you decide to borrow a personal loan to cover the cost of your child's education, consider Bankrate's picks for the best lenders. Are there personal loans specifically for private school? Unlike college, you can\u2019t finance private K-12 education with federal or private student loans. Rather, financial aid can be found through state grants or through each school\u2019s financial aid office. These funds are typically donor-based and offered to those who qualify. Others may offer payment plans or reduced tuition programs. While these options may help initially, if the financial aid falls short or you find yourself needing an extra boost to make the monthly payments, it may be necessary to look into financing the remaining costs. You can use any regular personal loan toward K-12 education costs as long as the lender doesn\u2019t specifically prohibit it. Some lenders, like Your Tuition Solution and Republic Finance, offer K-12 education loans specifically designed for private school tuition. These loans often provide the following:\n\u2022 Terms are usually between 24 and 84 months\n\u2022 APRs starting around 4 percent for borrowers with strong credit\n\u2022 Direct payment to schools in many cases Before applying, check the lender\u2019s terms and conditions to make sure the loan can be used for education-related expenses. You can also call the customer service department to confirm. Some lenders prohibit personal loan use for private collegiate-related costs, so it\u2019s best to clarify that this doesn\u2019t apply to all private education before applying.\n\nWhat to consider when comparing personal loan options Shopping for education loans can feel overwhelming, so take note of these key details:\n\u2022 What to consider in detail\n\u2022 Interest rates and fees: K-12 education loans often offer lower rates than regular personal loans for qualified borrowers. But rates swing widely based on your credit score \u2013 from under 5% to over 30%. Watch for origination fees, prepayment penalties, and late fees too.\n\u2022 Loan terms: The best loan length for annual tuition is 12 months, with 24 months being the maximum worth considering. You don\u2019t want to still be paying for kindergarten when your child reaches middle school.\n\u2022 Payment process: Some lenders send money directly to schools, others send it to you. Make sure the timing works with your school\u2019s payment deadlines.\n\u2022 Warning signs: Avoid lenders promising guaranteed approval regardless of credit, charging interest rates above 36%, or pressuring you to sign without time to review terms. When should I take out a personal loan to pay for school? The smartest time to plan for private school costs is before you need the money. Personal loans can solve immediate funding problems, but they work better as bridge financing while you build a sustainable education budget. Think about how many children you\u2019ll send to private school, ask about multi-child discounts, and find out if schools offer merit scholarships beyond need-based aid. Sometimes you need financing quickly. For instance, a personal loan might make sense if there\u2019s a last-minute opening at your child\u2019s preferred school and you need to arrange funding fast. Bankrate\u2019s take: Remember that your child\u2019s education is important, but so is your family\u2019s financial stability. If you\u2019re prioritizing private school, make sure your financing strategy sets both you and your child up for long-term success. Make sure interest rates work in your favor Personal loan rates can be high, sometimes rivaling credit card interest rates, so your creditworthiness matters. The current average personal loan rate sits above 12 percent. If you can qualify for a rate below that benchmark with excellent credit, borrowing could work for your child\u2019s K-12 education. But borrowers with bad credit might face rates as high as 36 percent, making the debt very expensive. Bankrate\u2019s take: Prequalify with as many personal loan lenders as possible before formally applying. Prequalifying for a personal loan allows you to compare rates and terms from multiple lenders without harming your score, though it doesn\u2019t guarantee approval. Your credit score, credit history and previous repayment behavior determine the rate you qualify for. Whether rates stay high or begin falling, improving your credit score helps you qualify for better terms. What to know about personal loans for private schools Personal loans are disbursed in a lump sum amount typically within a week, so coordinate with the school\u2019s financial aid office if this timeline falls outside the payment window. That being said, consider the total borrowing cost carefully. Here\u2019s an example: Let\u2019s say your child\u2019s private school tuition is close to the national average of $15,000. Your excellent credit helps you qualify for a below-average rate of 10 percent. While you can choose a personal loan repayment term as long as seven years, it doesn\u2019t make sense to take on a multi-year debt for a single year\u2019s tuition. Over the course of a 12-month repayment term, you\u2019ll pay over $800 in interest. While a two-year term results in a lower monthly payment, you\u2019ll pay twice as much in overall interest and will still be repaying the loan after the school year ends.\n\u2022 Calculate your actual funding gap before borrowing the full tuition amount\n\u2022 Some schools work with preferred lenders that may offer better terms\n\u2022 Ask your financial aid office about all available options While a personal loan is a good last-resort option, it shouldn\u2019t be the first consideration when paying for private school, especially if you don\u2019t have exceptional credit. Review the following options before taking on more debt.\n\u2022 Some schools offer financial aid based on a family\u2019s income compared to the yearly tuition costs. While every school differs in offerings and programs, it\u2019s best to apply as early as possible, as most schools operate on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis.\n\u2022 Fourteen states and Washington D.C. offer school voucher programs that use public funding for private school tuition. Eligibility varies by state but often targets low-to-moderate income families or students with special needs. Check if your state offers voucher programs through your state\u2019s Department of Education website.\n\u2022 Many private schools offer payment plans that break up the cost of tuition into multiple installments versus one to two larger payments. Be aware that sometimes these may be offered through third-party companies and some may charge extra fees, so comb through the terms and conditions before signing on to a payment plan.\n\u2022 Coverdell ESAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified education expenses, including K-12 tuition. Families can contribute up to $2,000 annually per beneficiary, subject to income limits ($220,000 for joint filers, $110,000 for single filers).\n\u2022 While a is aimed at funding your child\u2019s post-secondary education, you may still be able to use it for a K-12 education. But eligibility varies by state \u2014 if you use a 529 on K-12 tuition and your state doesn\u2019t allow it, you\u2019ll have to repay any state tax deductions you filed with the plan.\n\u2022 Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn at any time without penalty, making them a flexible education funding source. If you\u2019ve been contributing for 15 years at $5,000 annually, you could withdraw $75,000 tax-free for education expenses, but only withdraw if you have other retirement savings since this reduces your future retirement security.\n\u2022 Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts provide tax-advantaged savings for children\u2019s expenses, including education. Unlike 529 plans, these accounts aren\u2019t restricted to education use. Keep in mind that assets in these accounts become the child\u2019s property at majority age, which could impact future financial aid eligibility.\n\u2022 While federal tax law doesn\u2019t allow deductions for K-12 private school tuition, some states offer tax credits or deductions. Nine states currently provide various forms of tax relief for private education expenses. Consult a tax professional to understand available benefits in your state.\n\u2022 There are private school scholarships for K-12 at the state, local and nonprofit levels. There may even be scholarships and grants available within the school\u2019s financial aid office, though these will likely be offered on a \u2018first come, first serve\u2019 basis.\n\u2022 If you have good credit, you may qualify for a credit card with an introductory interest-free period. As long as you repay the full balance before the end of the promotional period (typically 12 to 21 months), you can avoid paying interest. Be mindful that any balance that remains at the end of the introductory period is subject to interest, and rates can be high. Only consider this option if you\u2019re certain you can zero your balance before the promo period ends. In many cases, personal loans can be used as K-12 education loans. Approval and funding typically only takes a few days, and rates for borrowers with excellent credit may be as low as 7 percent. If you don\u2019t qualify for a competitive rate, you could end up paying a hefty sum in interest \u2014 as much as 36 percent APR. The key is avoiding a cycle where you\u2019re constantly borrowing for each school year while still paying for previous years. Work closely with your school\u2019s financial aid office to understand all available options. Many schools want to help families find sustainable funding solutions and may offer resources you haven\u2019t considered.",

      "text": "How to build credit fast\nKey takeaways\n- High credit scores come with numerous benefits, such as lower interest rates, larger lines of credit and better rewards.\n- Exploring the fastest ways to build credit can help you take advantage of these perks as quickly as possible.\n- You\u2019ll need to maintain your credit by making your payments on time and keeping your balances low.\nA high credit score can make it easier to reach your financial goals, whether buying a new car or getting approved for a mortgage. If your credit score isn\u2019t as high as you\u2019d like \u2014 or you have no credit history \u2014 you may be eager to raise it as quickly as possible.\nWhile good credit doesn\u2019t happen overnight, there are things you can do to start seeing improvements quickly.\nHow fast can you build credit?\nHow fast you can build credit depends on various factors, including your current score and the strategies you use.\nYou may be able to incrementally improve your score within a few months if you:\n- Make on-time payments.\n- Keep your credit card balances low.\n- Diversify your credit accounts.\nHowever, building a solid credit history is a gradual process that takes time and consistent effort. A high credit score usually requires years of positive credit behavior. Rebuilding credit after a significant negative event, like bankruptcy or a defaulted loan, can take longer.\n9 ways to build credit fast\nWhile there\u2019s no quick-fix way to get a good credit score fast, there are many tactics you can use to start building credit quickly. Some changes can take effect as soon as a single reporting cycle, while others may take a few months to pay off.\nNote that new, positive information is weighed more heavily than older information, so the most important thing is to maintain good financial habits. None of these tips will have as big an impact as making consistent, on-time payments.\n1. Dispute credit report errors\nAlmost half of people (44 percent) have errors on their credit reports. While most of those errors don\u2019t cause negative credit effects, some do. Errors on your credit report may leave you with a score that\u2019s lower than you deserve, and disputing those errors can help you quickly improve your score.\nTo get started, access your free annual credit reports from all three bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com. Carefully review each report for errors, including on-time payments wrongly reported as missed or incorrectly reported credit limits.\nIf you find an error, gather evidence to support your dispute, such as billing statements or correspondence with creditors. You can then submit your dispute to the credit bureaus online, by mail or over the phone. For many people, online disputes are the quickest option. You can visit the three major credit bureaus\u2019 online dispute centers at:\nOnce your dispute is submitted, the credit bureau will investigate the error by contacting the creditor or lender. If the information is incorrect or unverifiable, the credit bureau must either remove or correct it.\nA credit repair company can do the dispute process for you if you don\u2019t want to do it yourself and can afford the service.\n2. Pay down your credit card balances\nYour credit utilization ratio is one of the most important factors affecting your credit score. It measures how much of your available revolving credit you\u2019re currently using. As a general rule, aim to use no more than 30 percent of your revolving credit.\nCredit scoring models look at both your overall and per-account credit utilization, and they typically only consider the most recently reported balances. You may be able to quickly improve your credit by paying down the card with the highest utilization ratio.\n3. Become an authorized user\nIf you have a friend or family member with excellent credit, becoming an authorized user on their credit card can be an effective strategy to build credit. An authorized user is someone who has official permission to use someone else\u2019s card.\nTo become an authorized user on someone else\u2019s credit account, the primary cardholder must add you to their credit card account. Typically, there\u2019s no credit check required and you receive a copy of the card. You can use the card for purchases, but the primary cardholder is responsible for making payments. Your credit report may reflect the card\u2019s full on-time payment history.\nBecoming an authorized user may help build your credit. However, there are some risks involved \u2014 if the primary cardholder racks up a large balance or pays the bill late, it could hurt your credit. It could also hurt your relationship with the primary cardholder if you spend more than they are comfortable with, so make sure to discuss expectations and plan accordingly.\n4. Deal with delinquent accounts\nAll credit accounts have a minimum payment for each monthly billing cycle. This is the amount required to keep your account in good standing. If your payment is more than 30 days past due, the account is considered delinquent. The lender may charge off the account or send the debt to collections.\nMaking payments on past-due accounts can help improve your credit. Once you\u2019ve caught up on late payments, you can try writing a goodwill letter to ask the creditor to remove the negative mark from your credit report. This strategy may be more likely to work if you fall behind on payments due to a situation out of your control.\nIf the account has been sent to collections, paying the past-due debt may still help your credit. Some newer credit scoring models ignore all paid collections accounts. Another option to consider is a pay-for-delete arrangement, where you ask the debt collector to remove the negative mark on your credit in exchange for payment.\n5. Open a credit card account\nOne especially effective way to build credit is to open a new credit card account. Your credit score might get dinged a little when you apply, but on-time payments can offset that quickly. Responsible credit card use, such as making timely payments and keeping balances low relative to credit limits, can help you establish a positive credit history.\nIf you have no credit history or poor credit, you can explore credit cards that are easier to get approved for. Retail credit cards tend to require only a fair score, so check to see if your favorite store offers its own card. Student credit cards can also be a good option if you\u2019re new to credit and are enrolled in college.\nIf you\u2019re having trouble getting approved for a card, you may need to explore secured credit cards. With secured cards, you put down a deposit (typically starting at $200), and that amount becomes your credit limit. The lender will report on-time payments on the account to the credit bureaus, but the best secured cards have other credit-building features to help boost your scores.\n6. Take out a credit builder loan\nA credit-builder loan is designed to help anyone with limited or poor credit history build credit by making regular, on-time payments.\nWith a credit-builder loan, the lender holds the loan funds in a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD) as collateral. While you make monthly payments toward the loan, these payments are reported to the credit bureaus.\nOnce the loan is paid off, you receive access to the funds, and your timely payments are reflected positively on your credit report, potentially improving your credit score.\n7. Request a credit limit increase\nIf you already have revolving credit in the form of credit cards or lines of credit, you may be able to improve your credit fast by increasing your total credit limit. Once approved, an increased limit on one account can decrease your overall credit utilization, which can boost your credit score.\nFor example, imagine you have only one credit card. It has a $500 balance and $1,000 limit, meaning you\u2019re using 50 percent of your available credit. If the lender agrees to raise the limit to $2,000, your $500 balance is now only 25 percent of your available credit.\nMost of the time, you will only be approved for a credit increase when your account with the lender is in good standing. While each bank and lender has different requirements, an increase may be more likely to be approved when accounts are paid off or have a low balance.\n8. Keep a mix of different account types\nMaintaining a diverse mix of credit accounts can be another way to build credit fast. Keep in mind, though, that while multiple accounts of various types can be beneficial, it won\u2019t help if all of your accounts are maxed out.\nConsider multiple types of funding like:\n- Auto loans\n- Credit cards\n- Mortgages\n- Personal lines of credit\n- Student loans\nMaintaining variety with your credit shows credit bureaus that you can manage multiple types of credit responsibly. This can contribute to a higher credit score.\n9. Get credit for your monthly bills\nPayment history is one of the most important credit scoring factors. Paying back your loans as agreed helps build your credit, while late payments or missed payments can hurt your credit. If you\u2019re trying to build credit from scratch, having your regular monthly bills or even rent payments reported to the credit bureaus could give your score a quick boost.\nCredit-building apps and services like Experian Boost can to help you get credit for paying your regular bills on time, though fees may apply. Experian says its service can instantly raise users\u2019 scores by an average of 13 points. With this free service, Experian looks through two years of your payment history for qualifying bills like rent, utilities and streaming services, then adds the on-time payments to your credit report.\nEven when you\u2019re sprinting toward a higher score, be patient, stay disciplined and track your progress to make adjustments when needed.\nThe bottom line\nBuilding credit is a journey that requires patience, but there are many steps you can take to start seeing results quickly. Disputing credit report errors, becoming an authorized user and getting credit for your regular monthly bills are just a few of the strategies you may consider using, depending on your situation.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

For example: a 5\u2010year $10,000 loan with 9.99% APR has 60 scheduled monthly payments of $201.81, and a 3\u2010year $5,000 loan with 6.99% APR has 36 scheduled monthly payments of $152.83. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver\u2019s license or other identifying documents.

      "text": "What is the average credit score for personal loans?\nKey takeaways\n- You\u2019ll typically need a credit score of at least 580 to qualify for a personal loan, but the higher your score, the more affordable your loan rate.\n- Lenders want to see that loan applicants have a history of responsibly paying debt, and your credit score provides a window into your past behavior.\n- The FICO credit scoring system ranges from 300 to 850, and is used by most lenders.\nThe average FICO credit score in the U.S. was 715 in early 2025, down a few points thanks to rising student loan delinquencies. Your chances of getting a low interest personal loan rate are much higher if you have good-to-excellent credit, typically a score of 740 and above.\nWhen you apply for a personal loan, your credit score is one of the most important factors lenders consider. Understanding how your score impacts your loan \u2014 and what you can do to improve it \u2014 can help you secure the most affordable financing possible.\nWhat credit score is needed for a personal loan?\nMost lenders require a minimum credit score of around 580 to qualify for a personal loan, though the specific requirement varies by lender. Keep in mind that qualifying for a loan is not the same as securing the best personal loan rates or terms \u2014 those generally go to borrowers with good to excellent credit, typically a FICO score of 740 or higher.\nIf your credit score is in the 800+ range, you\u2019ll have the best chance at securing a lender\u2019s lowest advertised rates, the largest loan amounts and the most flexible repayment terms.\nSince each lender sets its own eligibility requirements, the credit score you\u2019ll need to qualify varies by lender. Here are a few examples from popular lenders:\n| Lender | APR range | Minimum credit score | Loan amounts |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Upgrade | 7.99%-35.99% | 580 | $1,000\u2013$50,000 |\n| Avant | 9.95%-35.99% | 550 | $2,000\u2013$35,000 |\n| Happy Money | 7.95%-29.99% | 640 | $5,000\u2013$40,000 |\n| SoFi | 8.99%-35.49% | 300 | $5,000\u2013$100,000 |\n| Upstart | 6.70%-35.99% | 300 | $1,000\u2013$50,000 |\n| Best Egg | 6.99%-35.99% | 600 | $2,000\u2013$50,000 |\n| LightStream | 6.49%-25.14% | 695 | $5,000\u2013$100,000 |\nIf you need to borrow a personal loan but don\u2019t have good credit, work to improve your credit score before comparing lenders. Boosting your score will result in lower rates and interest savings.\nPersonal loans for bad credit\nBad credit personal loans are designed for borrowers with poor credit, and lenders may place more emphasis on your income, employment history or education to determine your eligibility. But if you have bad credit, you can expect higher interest rates, lower loan amounts and fewer lender options.\nGenerally, the minimum credit score needed to qualify for a personal loan is 580, though some lenders accept scores as low as 300. If you qualify, ensure that you can afford to repay the loan as agreed. You should also watch for signs of predatory lending by verifying a lender\u2019s credentials and checking borrower reviews before applying.\nHow does your credit score affect your personal loan rate?\nYour credit score is one of the most important factors lenders use to set your personal loan rate. Borrowers with higher scores can typically access lower APRs, resulting in significant savings over the life of the loan.\nConsider the below example, in which two borrowers with differing credit apply for the same loan ($10,000 repaid over five years):\n| Borrower profile | APR | Monthly payment | Total interest paid |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Very good credit (740+) | 12% | $222 | $3,347 |\n| Poor credit (<579) | 35.99% | $361 | $11,676 |\nThe borrower with strong credit qualified for an APR close to the average personal loan rate, while the borrower with bad credit received the lender\u2019s top-end rate. Over the life of the loan, the borrower with good credit will save over $8,300 in interest charges.\nTaking the time to increase your credit score before borrowing can be well worth the investment.\nHow do personal loans affect your credit score?\nTaking out a personal loan can impact your credit, but whether it does so positively or negatively depends on how you manage it. For example, if you use a personal loan to consolidate debt, you will likely be able to improve your credit score significantly over time. Making regular, on-time payments will also help you improve your credit score over time.\nBenefits of personal loans\nPersonal loans can be a good way to build your payment history, improve your credit mix and reduce your credit utilization ratio. In addition, you may be able to access lower rates than you could with a credit card. When managed responsibly, a personal loan may have the following effects:\n- Builds payment history: Making loan payments on time establishes a positive payment history that will improve your credit score over the life of the loan.\n- Improves credit mix: Having multiple types of credit helps improve your credit score. If you already have a line of credit or credit card, an installment loan will improve your credit mix and likely raise your credit score.\n- Reduces credit utilization: Your credit utilization ratio is the measure of your available revolving credit and how much of it you\u2019re using. A debt consolidation loan for your revolving debt could improve your credit utilization.\nDrawbacks of personal loans\n- Increases total debt: Every time you borrow a loan, you take on additional debt, which can temporarily lower your score.\n- Potential fees: Late fees and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees are some of the most common charges by lenders. You should also watch for origination fees, which can increase the cost of your loan.\n- Hard credit inquiry: Applying for a loan triggers a hard credit pull, which can drop your credit score by about five points. The good news is that the effect is typically short-lived \u2014 your score may rebound within a year or two.\nHow to build your credit\nImproving your credit before applying for a personal loan can boost your approval odds and lower your interest rate.\n- Pay down existing debt: Keeping your credit utilization below 30 percent of your credit limit can improve your credit score. If you have balances above that threshold, focus on paying them down to help improve your score.\n- Make on-time payments: Consistently making on-time payments on your credit cards and other loans, like a mortgage or auto loan, is one of the best ways to build your credit score quickly.\n- Open a secured credit card: If you don\u2019t qualify for a traditional credit card, a secured card can be a great alternative. To establish the credit line, you make an upfront cash deposit that serves as your credit limit. As you borrow against the line and repay the balance, your responsible repayment will boost your score.\n- Become an authorized user: Piggybacking on a family member\u2019s strong credit history by becoming an authorized user on the card can also help increase your credit score. But be careful \u2014 if they max out their card or fail to make the payments, your score will be damaged.\n- Review your credit reports: Check for errors or inaccuracies that may be dragging down your score. If you discover a mistake on your report, you can dispute the error with the reporting credit bureau.\nWhat to consider before applying\nBefore applying for a personal loan:\n- Check your credit score: Know where you stand so you can gauge what rates you\u2019ll likely qualify for. Your bank or credit card issuer may offer free access, or you can check your score with the credit bureaus for a fee.\n- Compare lenders: Look for the best personal loan rates, including competitive APRs, low fees and favorable terms.\n- Read the fine print: Understand all costs, including origination fees, prepayment penalties or restrictions.\n- Prequalify when possible: Soft credit checks allow you to estimate rates without hurting your score.\n- Calculate affordability: Use a personal loan calculator to ensure the monthly payments fit your budget.\nBottom line\nBefore taking out a personal loan, check your credit score and have a clear understanding of your overall financial health. Consider the APRs offered, compare lender requirements and calculate your monthly payments based on what you\u2019re eligible for.\nTo minimize damage to your credit score, prequalify with at least three lenders.

      "text": "What is a FICO score?\nKey takeaways\n- FICO scores are the most widely used type of credit score.\n- Most FICO scores range from 350 to 850, and a score of 670 or higher is considered good.\n- If your FICO score is on the low side, you can take steps to improve it.\nYour credit score is a three-digit number that helps potential lenders predict how likely you are to repay money as agreed. A high score can help you reach your financial goals, whether that\u2019s getting a new credit card or buying a home, while a low credit score can hold you back.\nYou may see the terms \u201ccredit score\u201d and \u201cFICO score\u201d used interchangeably, but they\u2019re not the same thing. A FICO score is a specific type of credit score, and understanding how it works can help you improve your score and reach your goals.\nWhat FICO scores are\nFICO scores are a type of credit score created by Fair, Isaac, and Company (now called the Fair Isaac Corporation or FICO) in 1989. They\u2019re now one of the industry standards for credit scores. According to FICO, these scores are used by 90 percent of top lenders to make credit-related decisions. When you apply for a credit card, mortgage or personal loan, the lender will likely check your FICO score.\nA higher FICO score shows lenders that you\u2019re likely to repay debts on time. That can lead to better approval rates, lower interest rates, more favorable loan terms and even better credit card rewards.\nFICO score ranges\nMost FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with a higher score representing a better credit rating. Scores are classified into five categories: excellent, very good, good, fair and poor. (The FICO Auto Score and Bank Card Score range from 250-900. Those specialty scores may be used when you apply for a car loan or a credit card.)\n800-850: Excellent credit score\nEarning an excellent credit score shows lenders that you are likely to to repay loans as agreed. If you have a score over 800, lenders are more likely to offer you their best credit products. You can expect favorable loan terms and interest rates.\n740-799: Very good credit score\nPeople with a very good credit score are eligible for nearly all of today\u2019s best credit cards. Compared to borrowers with lower scores, you can look forward to lower interest rates on loans and mortgages, resulting in savings over time.\nHaving very good credit could also open the door to better rental opportunities or lower insurance premiums.\n670-739: Good credit score\nA score in this range suggests that you can manage debt responsibly. Lenders will likely accept credit card or loan applications from borrowers in this range. However, you may not qualify for the best interest rates and terms, so you can still benefit from improving your credit.\n580-669: Fair credit score\nLenders may classify people with scores in this range as \u201csubprime\u201d borrowers. People with fair credit scores may not have as many borrowing options as people with higher scores. You may find you\u2019re not eligible for certain credit cards or mortgages, though the good news is that many lenders will still approve loans with this score.\n300-579: Poor credit score\nA score in this range is sometimes called \u201cbad credit\u201d because it warns lenders that you may be a risky borrower. You may have trouble getting approved for credit \u2014 unless you\u2019re applying for cards specifically designed to help you rebuild your credit. With time, it\u2019s possible to improve your credit score.\nHow FICO scores are calculated\nYour FICO score is calculated based on the information in your credit report. This information is grouped into five categories: payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix and new credit. Each category has a specific weight in the FICO formula.\nPayment history (35 percent)\nYour payment history shows whether you\u2019ve paid your credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans and mortgage loans as agreed. It\u2019s weighted so heavily because it\u2019s a reliable way for lenders to predict whether you\u2019ll repay debts on time. A history of on-time payments helps your score, while late payments, collections accounts and bankruptcies have the opposite effect.\nAmounts owed (30 percent)\nYour amount owed, or credit utilization ratio, refers to both how much debt you carry in total and the percentage of your available credit you\u2019re using. FICO weighs this category heavily because the amount you owe affects your ability to make all your monthly debt payments on time and avoid overreliance on credit. Using a low percentage of your available credit can improve your score, while using a high percentage can harm your score.\nLength of credit history (15 percent)\nThe length of your credit history refers to how long you\u2019ve had and used credit. The FICO scoring model considers factors like the age of your oldest account and the average age of all your accounts.\nFICO says a longer credit history will always have a positive effect on a person\u2019s score \u2014 because it shows you have experience managing debt \u2014 but you can still have a good credit score with a short credit history.\nCredit mix (10 percent)\nYour credit mix refers to the various types of credit accounts you have. Credit accounts fall into two main categories: revolving and installment. Revolving accounts include credit cards and home equity lines of credit, while installment accounts include mortgages, car loans and student loans. Having a good mix of account types shows that you can successfully manage different types of debt.\nNew credit (10 percent)\nYour FICO score considers how many new credit accounts you\u2019ve opened, as well as how many of your accounts are recent. Your credit score may drop a few points when you apply for new credit. The impact is fairly short-lived since FICO only considers credit inquiries from the past 12 months. New credit accounts could also improve your score if they help diversify your credit mix.\nHow lenders use your FICO scores\nLenders use your FICO scores to quickly and objectively determine the risk of offering you credit. A higher FICO score shows you\u2019re more likely to repay money as agreed, so the lender may be willing to offer a higher credit limit or lower interest rate. A lower score, on the other hand, warns lenders that you could be a higher-risk borrower.\nOther potential creditors, such as landlords, cell phone providers and utility companies, also use FICO scores to assess the risk that you won\u2019t pay on time. People with low FICO scores may have trouble entering into contracts or be required to pay a security deposit.\nThe different FICO versions\nYou have more than one FICO score. There are multiple versions of FICO scores available, as well as industry-specific scores. The models share a similar foundation, so if one FICO score is high, your other FICO scores will likely be high.\nChanges with newer FICO versions\nThe most widely used version is FICO Score 8, though some lenders have upgraded to the company\u2019s newer models, such as FICO Score 9 or FICO Score 10 or 10T.\nFICO Score 9 ignores third-party collection accounts that have been paid off. This version will consider rental history (if it\u2019s reported) and doesn\u2019t factor in unpaid medical collections as heavily as prior versions.\nFICO Score 10 puts more weight on late payments and credit utilization. FICO Score 10T considers trended data to measure how well you\u2019ve managed your accounts over time.\nIndustry-specific FICO scores\nThe base FICO scores are designed to estimate how well a person can manage any type of credit product, whether it\u2019s a mortgage or a credit card. There are also industry-specific FICO scores that reflect how well you\u2019ll manage a specific credit product.\nFor example, if you\u2019re refinancing a car loan, a lender might check your FICO Auto Score. If you\u2019re applying for a credit card, a lender may check your FICO Bankcard Score.\nFICO vs. VantageScore\nFICO is not the only service that provides credit scores. VantageScore is another common credit scoring model, which the three credit reporting bureaus created as an alternative to the FICO score.\nLike FICO, VantageScore assigns consumers a credit score between 300 and 850 based on the information in their credit reports. In the VantageScore model, a score of 781 or higher is considered excellent. Your FICO score and VantageScore will likely vary because VantageScore considers different scoring factors and weighs them differently.\nVantageScore 4.0 uses the following formula:\n- Payment history: 41 percent\n- Credit utilization: 20 percent\n- Credit history and credit mix: 20 percent\n- Credit balances: 6 percent\n- Credit applications: 11 percent\n- Available credit: 2 percent\nHow to improve your FICO score\nIf your FICO score is lower than you\u2019d like, it\u2019s possible to improve or rebuild your score over time. Here are some tips to start improving your score:\n- Fix errors on your credit report: Many people have errors on their credit reports. Errors can include incorrect credit limits, accounts that belong to someone else or negative marks that should have already fallen off the report. Contact the credit bureaus or work with a credit repair company to get the errors fixed.\n- Keep your credit card balances low: The FICO model weighs the amount you owe heavily. To improve your score, pay down outstanding debt and aim to keep your credit utilization ratio at 30 percent or lower.\n- Make payments on time: Since your payment history makes up 35 percent of your FICO score, making payments on time, every time is crucial for building a good credit history.\nNext steps\nAchieving a good FICO score can be an important part of reaching your financial goals and getting the credit cards, car loans and mortgages you need. To start your credit repair journey, check your FICO score to find out where you stand. Then, focus on managing credit responsibly and keeping your credit report free of errors to get your score moving in the right direction.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

The average is often well below average credit card rates, making personal loans a great choice for credit card debt consolidation, so long as you qualify for those average rates.\nThe current average personal loan interest rate is 12.58 percent.\n\u2014 Bankrate Monitor data for Aug. 6, 2025\nIf you\u2019re very rate-conscious, it\u2019s also important to track how the lowest available rates are trending. You may qualify for a rate lower than current home equity or HELOC rates if you have excellent credit and know which lenders are offering the best rates. Knowing the averages and lowest rates can give you the information you need to make the best borrowing decision for your finances.\nAverage personal loan rates for August 2025\nAccording to Bankrate Monitor data, as of Aug. 6, 2025, the average personal loan rate is 12.58 percent for customers with a 700 FICO score, $5,000 loan amount and three-year repayment term. Your rate will vary depending on your credit score, loan term, loan amount and the type of lender you choose.\nThe Bankrate Monitor survey collects rates from the 10 largest banks and thrifts in the 10 largest U.S. markets, assuming you don\u2019t already have a relationship and aren\u2019t set up for automatic payments.\nThe lowest personal loan rate offered among Bankrate\u2019s best personal loan lenders has dropped since early 2025 and now sits at 6.49 percent from LightStream. That\u2019s a drop of nearly one-half of a percentage point from 6.94 percent in January. Qualifying for a lender\u2019s lowest rate typically requires excellent credit, high income compared to your debt and opting for a three-year or shorter term.\nYou\u2019ll typically find lower average rates at banks and credit unions compared to online lenders and marketplace lending sites like Bankrate. However, some online lenders offer very low rates for borrowers with excellent credit who qualify for a short term (usually three years).\nIf you don\u2019t know what you qualify for, consider getting prequalified offers on a personal loan marketplace site like Bankrate. With some basic information about your loan amount, credit score and loan term, you may be matched with several different lenders. You can review the offers side by side to see which is the best fit for you.\nAverage personal loan interest rates by lender type\nYou\u2019ll typically find lower average rates at banks and credit unions compared to online lenders and marketplace lending sites like Bankrate.

With some basic information about your loan amount, credit score and loan term, you may be matched with several different lenders. You can review the offers side by side to see which is the best fit for you.\nAverage personal loan interest rate by online lender\nThe lowest available rate among Bankrate-reviewed lenders is just below 6.5 percent, while the highest is almost 36 percent.\nOne thing to watch out for when it comes to online lenders is fees. They can be as high as 12 percent of your loan amount and are subtracted from any loan proceeds before you receive your money.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to review the annual percentage rate (APR) on any personal loan offers you receive, which reflects the full cost of your loan, including fees. Try to choose online lenders that don\u2019t charge origination fees, if you qualify.\nAPR ranges at Bankrate-reviewed online lenders\n| Online lender | Loan interest rates |\n|---|---|\n| Achieve | 8.99%-29.99% |\n| Avant | 9.95%-35.99% |\n| Best Egg | 6.99%-35.99% |\n| Happy Money | 7.95%-29.99% |\n| LendingClub | 7.90%-35.99% |\n| LendingPoint | 7.99%-35.99% |\n| LightStream | 6.49%-25.14%* with autopay |\n| OneMain Financial | 18.00%-35.99% |\n| Prosper | 8.99%-35.99% |\n| SoFi | 8.99%-35.49% with autopay |\n| Upgrade | 7.99%-35.99%with autopay |\n| Upstart | 6.70%-35.99% |\nAverage personal loan interest rates by banks\nAccording to recent data from the National Credit Union Administration, the average finance rate for personal loans offered by commercial banks is 12.03 percent for a three-year term.\nYou\u2019ll typically need a high credit score and a solid work history to get approved for a personal loan at a bank. However, banks may offer more competitive rates for loans secured by a portion of your savings deposits.\nAPR ranges of Bankrate-reviewed banks\n| Bank | Loan interest rates |\n|---|---|\n| Citi | 7.99%-19.49% |\n| M&T Bank | 7.74%-13.94% |\n| TD Bank | 8.99%-23.99% |\n| Santander Bank | 7.99%-24.99% |\n| U.S. Bank | 8.74%-24.99% with autopay |\n| Wells Fargo | 6.74%-26.74% with autopay |\n| USAA | 9.74%-18.51% |\nAverage personal loan interest rates by credit union\nAccording to NCUA data, the national average rate for a three-year personal loan at a credit union was just 10.75 percent in 2025\u2019s first quarter. Average maximum rates are significantly lower than banks and online lenders \u2014 in fact, at federal credit unions they are legally capped at 18 percent \u2014 making credit unions worth researching if you\u2019re eligible for membership.\nA recent personal loan shopping report by a Bankrate expert found that credit unions tend to offer slightly lower rates for longer terms. You also typically won\u2019t pay any fees, which keeps your APR and quoted rate the same and means you\u2019ll take home all the money you borrow.\nAPR ranges of Bankrate-reviewed credit unions\n| Credit union | Loan interest rates |\n|---|---|\n| PenFed Credit Union | 8.99%-17.99% |\n| Municipal Credit Union | 7.99%-17.99% |\n| Navy Federal Credit Union | 8.99%-18.00% |\nAverage lowest personal loan rates\nIf you have excellent credit, you may qualify for a rate significantly lower than the overall Bankrate Monitor average. Although the median rate offered by the lenders we track has risen a fraction of a percentage point since January, the lowest available rate has dropped.\n| Date | Median lowest rate* | Lowest available rate* |\n| 5/7/25 | 8.99% | 6.49% |\n| 4/30/25 | 8.99% | 6.49% |\n| 3/26/25 | 8.99% | 6.49% |\n| 2/26/25 | 8.99% | 6.70% |\n| 1/29/25 | 8.99% | 6.94% |\n| 1/1/25 | 8.83% | 6.94% |\nHow to get the lowest available personal loan rates\nPersonal loan average rates give you an idea of the rates paid by the average consumer. However, if you\u2019re in the excellent credit category and want the lowest possible rates, watch for changes to minimum rates instead.\nThere are a few steps you can take to be in the right place at right time to get the lowest personal loan rates:\n- Check our rate pages regularly. We have a team of experts that tracks the rates of dozens of lenders daily to ensure you see the most current rates they\u2019re offering.\n- Keep your credit score in tip-top shape. Minimize your credit card use to avoid a temporary, but large, dip in your score due chasing travel or cash-back rewards.\n- Don\u2019t wait if you see the rate you want. Lenders change rates frequently based on factors beyond your control. If you see a personal loan rate that helps you meet your financial goals, apply sooner rather than later.\nAre average personal loan rates high?\nBased on the personal loan interest rate forecast for 2025, good credit borrowers may be rewarded with lower rates this year.\nRates will be slightly lower, all else being equal, for borrowers with good credit.\u2014 Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst\nHowever, McBride warns that current rates may be driven more by the lenders offering them than any actions taken by the Federal Reserve. That means personal loan rates may differ noticeably based on whether you choose a bank, credit union, online lender or marketplace lender like Bankrate.\nHow to use average personal loan rates to decide which personal loan is best for you\nThere are a few different ways to look at the ups and downs in average personal loan rates when you\u2019re deciding whether a personal loan is the best financing choice for you.\n- To decide whether credit card consolidation makes sense. Compare the average personal loan rate with the average rate on your credit cards to see if a debt consolidation loan is worth it.\n- To intuit who lenders are lending to. If averages are dropping, that could be a sign that lenders may currently prefer higher credit-score borrowers. If they\u2019re rising, lenders could be opening up more options for fair or even bad credit borrowers.\n- To watch for signs that excellent credit rates are dropping. If you\u2019re shopping for a specific rate, a drop in the average could mean lenders are making more loans to excellent credit borrowers. That would be a good time to check the minimum rates to see if they\u2019ve dropped.\nBottom line\nIf you like what you\u2019re seeing, it may be time to see what kind of loan offers you can get. Follow standard financial principles like paying bills on time, minimizing your credit card use and avoiding lenders that charge high fees.\nYou\u2019ll have a better shot at qualifying for low-interest rate personal loans if your finances are in good shape. Watch for the lowest available rates for opportunities. With a little extra attention, you might end up with a lower rate on your personal loan for home improvement than your neighbor got on his home equity renovation loan.\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

      "text": "What is credit history?\nKey takeaways\n- Your credit history is a record of how you have managed past debt and how you are handling ongoing debt.\n- Your credit history is outlined in detail in your credit report, which also includes any liens, credit inquiries or bankruptcies.\n- Credit history also helps to determine your credit score, a numerical value that indicates your creditworthiness to potential lenders.\n- You can improve your credit history by practicing healthy credit habits, like paying your bills on time, which can also impact your employment and rental options, credit card terms and offers as well as other lending opportunities.\nYour credit history is a look at how you have managed your credit in the past. If you are in the market for a new loan (such as a home mortgage loan, a car loan or a credit card), looking for a rental or even searching for a job, your credit history can have a significant impact. Find out more about what a credit history is, why credit history matters and ways you can improve it.\nWhat is credit history?\nThink of your credit history as a financial record of your credit activity. Among other financial information, it typically includes the following: whether you pay your bills on time, how many credit cards and other loans you have, what types of credit you use and how much debt you carry. Any late payments are typically reported after 30 days delinquent, so you could have late payments that trigger fees with your card issuer, for instance, but are not reported.\nYour credit history is recorded in a document called a credit report, which provides information about how you use your credit accounts, including your payment history and account balances. The report also provides your identifying information, details on any collections and bankruptcies on your record and information about credit inquiries. Even child support or alimony payments are part of your credit history and can have a negative impact if you miss a deadline.\nCredit history versus credit score\nYour credit score and credit history are related but are not the same. Your credit score is based on and calculated using an algorithm that includes your credit history that is documented on your credit report. Three major credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 generate credit reports, but they do not always record the same information in the same format.\nEach bureau uses one or more scoring models \u2014 typically FICO or VantageScore \u2014 to interpret the data it has collected and create your credit score. FICO and VantageScore have multiple versions; FICO 8 is the most commonly used credit scoring model.\nThe information on your credit report (your credit history) goes into a mathematical model that generates your credit score, which is typically a number between 300 and 850 that indicates how likely you are to pay off your debt. Because each credit scoring model has its own methods and criteria, your credit score with each one may vary. But each model is attempting to do the same thing: predict your likelihood of repaying your debts, specifically for the financial product you are applying for. So responsible financial behavior is likely to translate to a good score regardless of the model.\nUsing a report card analogy, your credit report would be the report card that documents your credit history, or how you did on all of your assignments for a semester. Your credit score would be an overall letter grade, such as an A+ or a D.\nHowever, note that you won\u2019t find your credit score on your credit report. To see your actual credit score, rather than the data that goes into it, you can check to see if the credit bureau offers a free credit score and credit report. You might have to provide some personal information, such as your Social Security number. You can also purchase a more detailed report and score directly from one of the major credit bureaus or a third-party service, or you may be able to get a free credit score from a credit card issuer such as American Express or Capital One (sometimes even if you aren\u2019t an account holder with that bank).\nChecking your own credit score shouldn\u2019t impact it since it\u2019s considered a soft check.\nWhy credit history is important\nLenders use your credit history to help determine whether to approve you for a loan or a credit card, as well as the size of your credit limit. Your credit history also influences the interest rate or cost of the loan you would be eligible for.\nEven if you\u2019re not in the market for credit right now, some employers check credit reports, and depending on the state it\u2019s common for landlords, utility companies and cell phone providers to check credit scores. Building and maintaining a strong credit score will serve you very well in life.\u2014 Ted Rossman, Bankrate Senior Credit Card Analyst\nSay you have a limited or no credit history because you\u2019ve never used credit or you\u2019re a young adult who is just starting out on your own. If you apply for a top-tier rewards credit card to help, you will likely be turned down due to insufficient credit history.\nOn the other hand, a long credit history full of on-time payments and responsible credit use can help you qualify for the best credit cards or secure a mortgage at a favorable interest rate.\nYou can get a full picture of your credit history by ordering your credit reports from the three major bureaus. You are entitled to a copy of your credit report for free from each of the three credit bureaus once a week. However, remember that these reports don\u2019t provide your score for free, only the data used to calculate your score. For your credit score, you\u2019ll need to purchase it from them or get it for free from credit card issuers and other services that provide it as a customer benefit.\nReviewing your credit report can help you better understand your financial challenges and areas that need improvement. It\u2019s also good to ensure the information is correct. Sometimes credit reports contain outdated or incorrect information which can wrongly prevent you from receiving access to credit, loans and good interest rates.\nHow to improve credit history\nHere are some best practices to build your credit score and establish a strong credit history:\n- Pay all of your bills on time, every time. Your payment history, which reflects whether you pay your bills by their due date, accounts for 35 percent of your FICO credit score. Late payments, usually reported when at least 30 days delinquent, will drag your score down. If you do have a late payment recorded on your credit report as part of your credit history but otherwise have a history of paying on time, you can reach out to your creditor and ask to remove it. This may or may not be successful, but it\u2019s worth a try.\n- Keep your credit card balances low. The amount you owe compared to the total credit available to you accounts for 30 percent of your credit score. The less debt you carry, the better your score is likely to be. Generally speaking, it\u2019s good to use no more than 30 percent of your available credit. Strive to pay your accounts off in full before the end of every billing cycle, if possible. Since your credit utilization is typically calculated once a month, making an extra payment mid-month can help bring it down.\n- Keep your oldest credit card account open. The length of your credit history \u2014 or, how long you\u2019ve been using credit \u2014 makes up 15 percent of your credit score. A longer history is better for your score. That\u2019s why, although it may seem wise to close inactive accounts, it\u2019s a good idea to keep them open because they contribute to your length of credit history and bring down your credit utilization. Closed accounts that are in good standing can stay on your credit reports for up to 10 years. For instance, it\u2019s OK to close an inactive credit card account if it\u2019s racking up unnecessary fees, but otherwise consider keeping it open and using it once in a while.\n- Don\u2019t apply for many credit cards within a short frame of time. New credit accounts for 10 percent of your credit score. This factor considers the number of new credit accounts you\u2019ve recently opened, as well as the number of recent credit applications you\u2019ve made. It\u2019s best to keep these to a minimum. However, when you\u2019re shopping for a big loan such as a mortgage loan or car loan, you do have a \u201crate-shopping window,\u201d which is a period of time within which multiple credit inquiries will be factored into your credit score just once.\n- Maintain a diverse portfolio of credit. Your credit mix makes up 10 percent of your credit score and accounts for the different types of credit accounts you have, including revolving debt (like credit cards) and installment debt (like student loans and mortgages).\n- Consider becoming an authorized user on a parent\u2019s/guardian\u2019s or spouse\u2019s/partner\u2019s credit card. When you\u2019re an authorized user, the primary cardholder\u2019s activity often gets added to your credit report. You don\u2019t have to use the card or even get a physical card to be added to the account, but this is a great way to build credit if you\u2019re starting from scratch \u2026 assuming the primary cardholder handles their card responsibly.\n- Use a third-party tool. You could also turn to alternative credit-building tools such as Experian Boost and eCredable Lift, suggests Ted Rossman, senior Bankrate analyst. These types of services can give you credit for things that haven\u2019t historically counted toward your credit score, including rent payments, streaming service subscriptions and utilities.\nThe bottom line\nYour credit history is an important factor that tells lenders your creditworthiness, or likelihood that you will repay your debt in a timely manner. It\u2019s a record of how well you have managed credit, containing information on your credit accounts (such as payments) and any negative marks against your creditworthiness (such as delinquencies and bankruptcies).\nCheck your credit report occasionally to make sure that your information is accurate since it informs your credit score. If your credit score isn\u2019t as high as you\u2019d like, engaging in good credit habits can help you to build your credit score.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

However, it's advisable to first explore scholarships and grants before resorting to loans, as personal loan rates can be high, sometimes reaching up to 36% APR for those with poor credit. When considering a personal loan, borrowers should compare rates from multiple lenders, be aware of terms and fees, and ensure the loan can be used for educational expenses. Additionally, improving one's credit score can lead to better loan terms and lower interest rates.",
