Despite these broader market fluctuations, investors often seek opportunities in smaller or newer companies that might offer growth potential at more accessible price points. Penny stocks, though an outdated term, continue to capture interest for their affordability and potential upside when backed by strong financials.\nTop 10 Penny Stocks In The United Kingdom\n| Name | Share Price | Market Cap | Rewards & Risks |\n| Foresight Group Holdings (LSE:FSG) | \u00a34.575 | \u00a3512.2M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 0 View Analysis > |\n| Warpaint London (AIM:W7L) | \u00a33.50 | \u00a3282.76M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\n| FDM Group (Holdings) (LSE:FDM) | \u00a31.234 | \u00a3134.9M | \u2705 2 \u26a0\ufe0f 4 View Analysis > |\n| Van Elle Holdings (AIM:VANL) | \u00a30.40 | \u00a343.28M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 3 View Analysis > |\n| RWS Holdings (AIM:RWS) | \u00a30.819 | \u00a3302.85M | \u2705 5 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\n| LSL Property Services (LSE:LSL) | \u00a32.81 | \u00a3289.08M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 1 View Analysis > |\n| Alumasc Group (AIM:ALU) | \u00a33.715 | \u00a3133.6M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\n| Begbies Traynor Group (AIM:BEG) | \u00a31.205 | \u00a3191.52M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\n| Croma Security Solutions Group (AIM:CSSG) | \u00a30.82 | \u00a311.29M | \u2705 2 \u26a0\ufe0f 4 View Analysis > |\n| Samuel Heath & Sons (AIM:HSM) | \u00a33.35 | \u00a38.49M | \u2705 2 \u26a0\ufe0f 3 View Analysis > |\nClick here to see the full list of 294 stocks from our UK Penny Stocks screener.\nBelow we spotlight a couple of our favorites from our exclusive screener.\nAdvancedAdvT (AIM:ADVT)\nSimply Wall St Financial Health Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nOverview: AdvancedAdvT Limited offers software solutions across Europe, the United Kingdom, North America, and other international markets with a market cap of \u00a3279.67 million.\nOperations: The company's revenue is derived from its Blank Checks segment, totaling \u00a343.27 million.\nMarket Cap: \u00a3279.67M\nAdvancedAdvT Limited, with a market cap of \u00a3279.67 million, reported annual sales of \u00a343.27 million and net income of \u00a310.88 million for the year ending February 28, 2025.
