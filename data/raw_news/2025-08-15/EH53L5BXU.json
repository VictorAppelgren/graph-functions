  "title": "Bankrupt Claire\u2019s Is Headed Toward Liquidation If No Buyer Found",
  "description": "Teen retailer Claire's has filed its second bankruptcy. It plans to close 700 stores and seek a buyer for its remaining business, an increasingly unlikely possibility.",
  "content": "Teen and tween retailer known for its ear-piercing services and affordable, trend-forward jewelry and accessories has filed its First Day Pleadings with the Delaware Federal Bankruptcy Court in support of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.\n\nIt outlines two paths forward for the troubled mall-based retailer. Under its go-forward plan, it must find a buyer for its remaining 800 North American stores after closing 700 stores, including all 120 Icing stores, its older sister brand, and 210 Walmart store-in-store locations.\n\nSarah Foss, Debtwire\u2019s global head of bankruptcy, doesn\u2019t have much hope it will follow this route. \u201cIt is unlikely that such a bidder will emerge,\u201d she told Retail Wire. In early June, the company reached out to 150 potential strategic and financial buyers and executed 60 confidentiality agreements. The company said it received multiple letters of intent and some negotiations are ongoing.\n\nIf no buyer is found, it will begin liquidation. Hilco Merchant Resources has already been signed to handle liquidation in the U.S. This is the most likely scenario since Claire\u2019s joined the infamous \u2018zombie\u2019 retailers club after filing multiple bankruptcies \u2013 Claire\u2019s filed first in 2018. Once a retailer reaches walking-dead status, it doesn\u2019t turn out well, just ask Forever 21, Rue21, Joann Fabrics, Party City and Rite Aid.\n\nCEO Chris Cramer blamed the company\u2019s failure on three factors: a shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, a heavy debt load and \u201cmacroeconomic factors,\u201d i.e. tariffs \u2013 70% of its products are imported, including 56% from China.\n\nYet, Cramer also serves as Claire\u2019s COO and CFO, which would test the limits of even the most talented executive overseeing an international retailer with 2,300 stores, including 1,350 in the U.S. and 13,000 employees, of which 7,000 are considered essential for the go-forward plan.\n\nSince its first bankruptcy filing, Claire\u2019s was able to bounce back, after it unloaded $1.9 billion in debt and secured $575 million in new capital under Elliott Management Corporation and Monarch Alternative Capital.\n\nIt also navigated the pandemic store closures and enjoyed a post-pandemic bounce in 2021, so much so that it filed for an IPO at the end of September 2021. But it got out over its skis in its ambitious plans and eventually withdrew the IPO in July 2023.\n\nEffectively, the company has been in a downward spiral ever since, and even with the change of leadership in June 2024 when Cramer stepped in and then-CEO Ryan Vero stepped down, the damage was done.\n\nThe Claire\u2019s banner alone operates nearly 2,000 retail stores, including 1,500 in North American and 825 internationally. It also supports some 200 international stores under a franchise model.\n\nThat store footprint puts it in league with retailers such as Target, Home Depot, Tractor Supply, Ulta, Gap Inc. across Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta, and Signet Jewelers, including Kay\u2019s, Zales and Banter by Piercing Pagoda, which goes head-to-head with Claire\u2019s in its mall base though it is more upscale.\n\nIt also expanded through a concession model. It partnered with retailers, including Kohls, CVS, and Walmart, to carry Claire\u2019s products from which it derived a sales commission.\n\nConcessions grew to over 20,000 locations through 2023. However, it didn\u2019t have the inventory management systems to support the concession business, let alone its core retail operations, and confronted serious inventory shrinkage issues in those locations.\n\nAfter being unable to turn a profit in the concessions business, it scaled back concessions to 9,000 locations over the last two years. Through the bankruptcy proceedings, all North American concessions will be shuttered. Note: Walmart was both a concession partner and host for Claire\u2019s operated store-in-stores.\n\nClaire\u2019s e-commerce storefront has been a big loser, proving \u201cnot conducive for the long-run,\u201d the company stated, especially since its core ear-piercing services can only be provided in-store. Plus the company failed to bring its e-commerce shopping experience up to current industry standards.\n\nAs the company tried to scale, it didn\u2019t have the necessary infrastructure to sustain that growth. Each store location carries some 7,500 individual SKUs, yet the existing supply chain system couldn\u2019t absorb the load nor could it effectively forecast demand.\n\nTo fix that problem, the company brought in Blue Yonder\u2019s end-to-end supply chain management system which went operational just before the 2023 holiday season, but by then it was too late.\n\nIn retrospect, Claire\u2019s rested upon its laurels and thought the past could carry it forward, as it stated:\n\n\u201cClaire\u2019s is a global brand powerhouse for self-expression, creating exclusive, curated and fun fashionable jewelry and accessories. Claire\u2019s is also a go-to establishment for ear piercing, having pierced over 100 million ears since 1978. Indeed, Claire\u2019s ear-piercing services are a renowned \u2018rite of passage\u2019 for millions of girls across the world who trust Claire\u2019s with their first ear-piercing experience.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t effectively adapt as disrupters swooped in with more trend-forward products and more modern ways to shop. \u201cLovisa offers younger shoppers a more sophisticated assortment at value prices,\u201d noted GlobalData\u2019s Neil Saunders. And Rowan has moved into the more premium space, offering all hypoallergenic jewelry and piercings performed only by licensed nurses. Ulta and Five Below have also entered the piercing space.\n\nAnd while the company cited a decline in mall shopping and a shift toward e-commerce as a major factor in its decline, it also observed:\n\n\u201dThe majority of the Company\u2019s customers are young individuals who do not themselves have access to funds, credit cards, or the ability to shop online. These customers rely on their parents or caretakers to bring them to the Company\u2019s stores so that they can see and touch the Company\u2019s products.\u201d\n\nSo which is it? Claire\u2019s describes its core customers as \u201cGen Zalpha,\u201d a combination of Generation Z, ages 13 to 28 years, and pre-teen Generation Alpha. A report by ICSC disputes the assertion that the younger generation is avoiding malls and other in-person retail experiences, based upon a survey of 1,000 GenZ consumers.\n\n\u201cOur research on Gen Z shows that malls are evolving into social hubs for this critical demographic.,\u201d shared Stephanie Cegielski, ICSC\u2019s vice president of research. \u201cThree in five Gen Zers visit malls just to socialize or meet friends, even if they don\u2019t have a specific purchase in mind.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s claim that young people aren\u2019t shopping at malls is a red herring. It didn\u2019t change with the times. The brand has been operating in essentially the same format with ear piercings and accessories since 1978.\n\nThe core Claire\u2019s customer back in the day is the grandmother of its core customer today. Meanwhile, emerging competitors, like Lovisa, Rowan and Studs have a youthful, modern vibe that Claire\u2019s can\u2019t match.\n\n\u201cThe chain has been swamped by a cocktail of problems, both internal and external, that made it impossible to stay afloat,\u201d GlobalData\u2019s managing director Saunders observed. \u201cMost recently, tariffs have pushed costs higher, and Claire\u2019s is not in a position to manage this effectively.\u201d\n\nHe sees little way forward for the company. \u201cReinventing will be a tall order in the present environment.\u201d\n\nDebtwire\u2019s Foss agrees and suggests that Claire\u2019s is too far gone to recover. \u201cBankruptcy can be a good option for a struggling retail chain, allowing it to refocus, trim its debt and slim down its retail footprint,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, retailers that have emerged from Chapter 11 only to file again a few years later often find themselves liquidating and shutting their doors entirely.\u201d",

      "text": "Claire\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Chris Cramer, appointed last year, is also the retailer\u2019s chief operating officer and chief financial officer, a consolidation of top roles that symbolizes the company\u2019s cash-strapped operation. The mall accessories and ear-piercing chain, once a magnet for the middle-school crowd, has moved from bejeweled to bedraggled \u2014 in bankruptcy court for the second time in seven years and looking for a buyer.\nIt\u2019s set to shutter 700 stores, including all Walmart shop-in-shops and Icing stores, and may liquidate its entire 1,500-store footprint in North America if a buyer doesn\u2019t come forward. In addition to the North America operations now under Chapter 11, the company has many locations, concessions and franchises overseas.\nA sale doesn\u2019t seem likely, though, as the company has no deal despite months of soliciting bids for all or some of the business, even as it prepares to liquidate, Cramer said. This dual track isn\u2019t unusual, but it doesn\u2019t bode well, according to Sarah Foss, global head of bankruptcy at Debtwire.\n\u201cAlthough Claire\u2019s retains flexibility to halt the store closing sales if a buyer emerges to purchase the company\u2019s assets on a going-concern basis, it is unlikely that such a bidder will emerge,\u201d Foss said in emailed comments. \u201cIndeed, the company has said that an actionable going-concern sale has not materialized for the 800 stores as of the bankruptcy filing.\u201d\nWhat happened\nIn a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware Wednesday, Cramer describes a retailer that managed to persevere through the pandemic, but has floundered ever since.\n\"It is unlikely that such a bidder will emerge.\"\nSarah Foss\nGlobal Head of Bankruptcy, Debtwire\nOf all Claire\u2019s operational difficulties and missteps, the rise of e-commerce and decline of the mall were particularly challenging, according to Cramer\u2019s filing. The retailer\u2019s own online channel lost it some $9 million in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2024.\nThen tariffs hit this year, a final straw given that nearly three-quarters of its inventory comes from outside the U.S., mostly China. As of June 23, its estimated cost of goods sold are set to increase by some $30 million due to higher tariffs, per court filings.\n\u201cThe majority of the Company\u2019s customers are young individuals who do not themselves have access to funds, credit cards, or the ability to shop online,\u201d Cramer told the court. \u201cThese customers rely on their parents or caretakers to bring them to the Company\u2019s stores so that they can see and touch the Company\u2019s products. Accordingly, the Company struggled to create an online website that could compare to the tactile shopping experience that is so vital for its young customers.\u201d\nTo offset higher costs, inflation and eventually tariffs, Claire\u2019s raised prices and shifted its inventory, which both backfired, he also said.\n\u201cThe majority of the Company\u2019s customers are young individuals who do not themselves have access to funds, credit cards, or the ability to shop online.\"\nChris Cramer\nCEO, COO and CFO, Claire's\n\u201cThe Company also focused on stocking its shelves with more \u2018core products\u2019 that are usable and wearable year-round, as opposed to trendy or seasonal merchandise,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ... did not have the anticipated result on the Company\u2019s bottom line, as the Company was left stocked with too many products that did not feel relevant to consumers. As a result ... sales declined, necessitating heavy discounts to sell excess inventory.\u201d\nTariffs have been a trade policy idiosyncratic to the Trump administration. But the retail trends that seem to have caught Claire\u2019s by surprise are not new, SiteWorks President Nick Egelanian said by email.\n\u201cHow many decades have they had to prepare for weakening traffic at malls?\u201d he said. \u201cI believe they are very dependent on stores in secondary malls \u2014 with no real strategy to diversify. That is a losing proposition.\u201d\nMeanwhile, as Claire\u2019s struggled to catch up on and offline, competitors swooped in.\n\u201cHow many decades have they had to prepare for weakening traffic at malls?\u201d\nNick Egelanian\nPresident, SiteWorks\nCramer cites Lovisa, Shein, Five Below, Ulta and Temu as taking wallet share. The retailer\u2019s piercing business even lost customers as Ulta and Five Below began to offer ear piercing and tattoo parlors grew in popularity for piercing, per his filing.\nLovisa and others have assortments and pricing \u201cmore attuned to what younger consumers want and has left Claire\u2019s looking somewhat out of step with modern demand,\u201d GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. \u201cAmazon and other online players have also turned the screw, especially as visits to some secondary malls where Claire\u2019s is present have waned.\u201d\nBankruptcy could be another opportunity for Claire\u2019s to turn around because there is still a place for it in the market, according to Saunders. The company, which has been backed by investment firms Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital since exiting its last bankruptcy, is shouldering nearly $691 million in debt obligations, per filings.\n\u201cReinventing will be a tall order in the present environment,\u201d Saunders said.\nClarification: This post has been updated to reflect which Elliott Management arm is backing Claire's."

      "text": "Robin Driver\n2 minutes\nClaire\u2019s emerges from bankruptcy\nRobin Driver\nOctober 13, 2018\nIllinois-based accessories retailer Claire\u2019s Stores, Inc. announced on Friday that it has successfully completed its financial restructuring and exited from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, having eliminated around $1.9 billion in debt and gained access to $575 million in new capital.\nClaire\u2019s filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 19, 2018, and last month received court approval for its Third Amended Plan of Reorganization, which came into effect on Friday.\nThe plan was sponsored by an ad hoc group of the company\u2019s first-lien creditors led by Elliott Management Corporation and Monarch Alternative Capital LP, but was initially opposed by the retailer\u2019s biggest second-lien debt holder Oaktree Capital Management, which at one point announced that it was trying to raise funds in order to purchase Claire\u2019s itself.\nFollowing negotiations that allowed for up to 25% recovery of second-lien creditors, Oaktree has since voted in favor of the company\u2019s current reorganization plan.\n\u201cWe committed at the beginning of this process that we would emerge as a healthier, more profitable company \u2013 and that is exactly what we have done,\u201d said Claire\u2019s Stores CEO Ron Marshall in a release. \u201cOur renewed financial strength cements Claire\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s leading specialty retailers of fashionable jewelry, accessories and beauty products for young women, teens, tweens and girls, and with our key growth initiatives already delivering value, we are well-positioned for long-term growth and success.\u201d\nOver the last few months, the company has closed 189 stores but expanded its concessions network to cover 6,631 locations, an increase of almost 700%.\nStore closures in the second quarter of 2018 contributed to a 0.7% decrease in the company\u2019s net sales in the period, which totaled $314.4 million. Same-store sales, however, saw a slight increase of 0.1% and Claire\u2019s was also able to reduce its net loss from the $20.49 million reported in Q2 2017 to $3.29 million.\nThe company carried on business as usual at its retail locations throughout the Chapter 11 process.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved."
