One, for a Singapore-based company called Kredivo, encourages people to use BNPL for minor, everyday purchases like train fares.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that flexible!\u201d the tagline says.\n\nAccording to the report, BNPL debt in Indonesia came to nearly $1.9 billion in May, a 40% increase from a year ago. The country\u2019s Financial Services Authority says 3.74% of that debt \u00adis nonperforming \u2014 meaning borrowers were more than 90 days behind on their \u00adrepayments \u2014 compared to 3.22% in May 2024.\n\n\u201cConsumers should assess their ability to repay the debt before using \u2018pay later\u2019 services,\u201d said Agusman, the agency official who oversees financing, venture capital, microfinance and other financial institutions. (Bloomberg notes that like many Indonesians, he goes by one name.)\n\nOn the other side of the world, BNPL options have become deeply embedded into American consumers\u2019 financial lives, \u201cinfluencing everything from daily grocery runs to major appliance purchases,\u201d as PYMNTS wrote last month.\n\n\u201cFor many consumers, BNPL has emerged as a primary payment choice, to the extent that its unavailability could alter their purchasing decisions,\u201d that report added.\n\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that 43% of consumers would choose not to make the payment or purchase at all if BNPL was not offered, while 42.4% said they would purchase a cheaper product or service (42.4%). In addition, 35.1% said they\u2019d complete the payment but delay other due payments, highlighting the influence of BNPL on financial management and spending patterns.",

      "text": "Private credit exists as an essential part of the capital spectrum, especially for firms that cannot get, or choose not to get, traditional bank channels. The private credit firms \u2014 including venture capital companies, buyout funds, hedge funds, direct lenders and others \u2014 are in turn significant partners for FinTech platforms that, themselves, extend loans.\nThe capital flows that connect banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and the latter\u2019s end customers is increasingly interwoven, with risks and rewards extending across that continuum.\nThe Fed\u2019s Data\nIn a report by the Boston Fed, research shows that banks have been increasing their exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), a category that includes private equity (PE) and private credit (PC). The data shows that large banks\u2019 total loan commitments to PE/PC funds are approximately $300 billion, or 14% of large banks\u2019 total lending to NBFIs, as of the end of 2023. The tally was less than $10 billion in 2013.\nThe central bank contends that \u201cunderstanding the scale and complexity of bank-NBFI connections is important for identifying potential risks to financial stability \u2014 that is, the financial system\u2019s ability to continue supplying capital to the economy if strained by shocks.\u201d The PE and PC firms, in turn, put money to work in the economy.\nBut, as the Fed report details, when these firms are hit by shocks, \u201cthey tend to draw down their bank lines of credit at a faster rate than firms with only bank credit. This creates a channel through which PC funds may increase banks\u2019 credit and liquidity risks, on balance.\u201d\nIn recent months, PYMNTS has reported on the opportunities and growth industries funded by private credit. AI has been a particular area of increased investment, representing a $1.8 trillion market for funding to help build out data centers and other infrastructure. And in general, banks such as JPMorgan have been ramping up their own efforts to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, to increase private credit transactions. HSBC has reportedly been mulling making inroads into the private credit.\nWithin FinTech, last year, for example, SumUp, a U.K. FinTech focused on POS hardware and issuing services, garnered a $1.6 billion loan provided by lenders including Goldman Sachs Asset Management, BlackRock, Apollo Global Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Vista Credit Partners.\nEarnings results have also underscored the presence of private, institutional investors on platforms, buying loans extended by those digital lenders. Upstart, in one example, has detailed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that \u201cout of the total principal of loans transacted on our marketplace during the three months ended March 31, 2025, 60% were purchased by institutional investors.\u201d\nPersonal loans originated in the most recent quarter stood at $2 billion. Earlier this week, Upstart signed a capital arrangement with Fortress, where the private credit firm is purchasing up to $1.2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform.\nAs for the state of these arrangements, Upstart CFO Sanjay Datta said on the call that \u201cthese committed partnerships are frankly behaving exactly as designed. The basis of these partnerships was that we essentially committed to navigating the different parts of the macro cycle together \u2026 We believe we have the tools to read and react to shifts in the credit risk environment very quickly on behalf of the partners.\u201d The securitization markets are functioning well, the executive said on the call.\nUpstart CEO Dave Girouard said on that same call that \u201cwe\u2019ve had no pullbacks from our private credit \u2026 committed capital partners, and we likewise had no pullbacks from banks or credit unions \u2026 our credit continues to perform.\u201d\nLendingClub, in its own earnings report, said that its structured certificates are a \u201cpreferred structure for private credit\u201d and represented 29% of the nearly $2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform in the first quarter.\nDrew LaBenne, CFO of LendingClub, told analysts on the conference call that \u201cthe opportunity is massive in the insurance market. And if you think about a lot of the transactions that we\u2019re doing today with asset managers and private credit, a big pool of the money that they\u2019re managing is insurance money.\u201d\nThe Fed paper states: \u201cPrivate funds may be growing more reliant on bank loans, both by taking larger loan commitments relative to fund assets and by utilizing a higher percentage of those loan commitments.\u201d\nThe read across here is that the interconnectedness, and the leverage, bear watching in an environment where things are functioning well but where the clouds of macro volatility can gather at a moment\u2019s notice."

The private credit sector is increasingly involved in financing these BNPL companies, providing loans at competitive rates, while the interconnectedness of banks and non-bank financial institutions raises concerns about financial stability amid macroeconomic volatility.",
