  "description": "US equity futures are little changed ahead of key inflation data. President Trump has extended a pause of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days. Beijing has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 processors, which the chip giant had agreed to share sales revenue of with the US government. Paul Donovan of UBS Global Wealth Management and Priya Misra of JPMorgan Asset Management preview the US CPI data. Norway Wealth Fund CEO Nicolai Tangen joins following the fund's best quarter since late 2023 and says that US inflation could be persistent. \u201cBloomberg Brief\u201d delivers the market news, data and analysis you need to set your agenda. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > IT IS 5:00 A.M. IN NEW YORK CITY. I AM DANI BURGER WITH YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. 90 MORE DAYS, THE U.S.-TRADE TRUCE HAS BEEN EXTENDED WHILE THE GUIDANCE ON NVIDIA CHIPS COMPLICATE THE SIZE. STOCK FUTURES AND TREASURIES RISE AS RATE CUT HOPES HANG IN THE BALANCE. IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST WEALTH FUND, NOT ITS BEST QUARTER, BUT DO NOT MISS OUR INTERVIEW WITH NICOLAI TANGEN. STOCKS AND TREASURIES RISING BUT BARELY. WE ARE UNCHANGED. THE S & P AND NASDAQ UNMOVED. WE FELL, MISSING OUT ON ALL-TIME HIGHS. LESS THAN A PERCENT AWAY FROM THE CPI COULD MAKE OR BREAK THE TREND. SMALL CAPS OUTPERFORMING AND BONDS ARE LITTLE CHANGED SO WHY GET UP AND TAKE ANY RISK AHEAD OF ACE -- AHEAD OF CPI. 8:30 AM IS WHERE WE EXPECT THAT. HEADLINE INFLATION IS SET TO COME AT .3%. 4.2791. LET US LOOK AT THE STOCKS THAT ARE MOVING AT A LOOK AT THAT WITH VALERIE. VALERIE: GOOD MORNING. LET US START WITH NVIDIA AFTER CHINA URGED LOCAL VISIT -- BUSINESSES NOT TO USE THE H20 CHIP. THIS COMES AS CHINA TRYING TO PROTECT ITS DOMESTIC CHIP INDUSTRY. WE HAVE SOME STOCKS IN ASIA AND CHINA AND SOME TRADE LIMIT UP. THIS IS A MOVE BROADLY SEEN AS CHINA TRYING TO PROTECT ITS GROWING CHIP INDUSTRY. DOWN .4%. A BIT OF A DIFFERENT STORY, UNTIL RALLYING UP INTO -- UP 3% AFTER THE CEO MET IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HAD SOME DIFFERENT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE CEO AFTER CALLING FOR HIS RESIGNATION A FEW DAYS AGO. THE STOCK IS REBOUNDING FOR A SECOND DAY IN A ROW. LASTLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BIG BEAR AI WHICH USES AI SOFTWARE AND CELLS AIR I -- AI SOFTWARE TO BUSINESSES. THE STOCK IS LOSING 28% WITH A BIG MISS IN REVENUE IN THE MARKET HAD NOT EXPECTED A LOST OF -- A LOSS OF SIX SONS PER SE OR -- PER SHARE AND THEY CAME UP WITH A 71% LOSS. THEY HAD SOME CONTRACTS WITH BIG COMPANIES INCLUDING THE U.S. ARMY. DANI: WE WILL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER AND THEN ALSO A REALLY FANTASTIC LINEUP. WE WILL COUNT DOWN TO THE LATEST INFLATION PRINT WITH PAUL DONOVAN AND PRIYA. PLUS WE WILL SPEAK TO THE NORWAY WEALTH FUND CEO NICOLAI TANGEN ON THEIR BEST QUARTER IN TWO YEARS. TRUTHS EXTENDED. PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CONTINUE DEFERRING STEEP LEDGE FIT -- LEVIES ON CHINESE GOODS FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS. JOINING US FOR THE DETAILS IS BRENDAN MURRAY, SO, ANOTHER 90 DAYS. BRENDAN: THIS TAKES A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY OFF OF THE TABLE THAT HAS BEEN HOVERING OVER THE U.S. ECONOMY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. WOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP EXTENT THE TRUCE, OR WHAT THEY RE-ESCALATE. NO ONE EXPECTED THEM TO RE-ESCALATE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE GLOBAL TARIFFS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK. THEY TRIED IT IN APRIL AND IT DID NOT GO WELL. FINANCIAL MARKETS REACTED BADLY TO THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE DONE. WE GET ANOTHER THREE MONTHS TO SEE IF THE TWO SIDES CAN WORK THROUGH SOME OF THEIR ISSUES ON THE PATH TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS, A SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT XI JINPING. WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THAT AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ASKED CHINA TO PURCHASE SOYBEANS. WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE CHINESE ON THAT FRONT. WHERE WE ARE NOW IS THE OLD TRADE WAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP STARTED IN HIS FIRST TERM INVOLVES THINGS LIKE CHINESE PURCHASES OF GOODS LIKE SOYBEANS , AND WE HAVE EVOLVED INTO REALLY WHAT IS ATAC MORE THAN TRADE WAR. DANI: LET US GET INTO IT BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT THE U.S. WOULD ALLOW NVIDIA AND AMD TO SELL ITS MOST ADVANCED CHIPS ASSUMING THAT THE U.S. GOT 15% OF THAT REVENUE. IT SEEMS LIKE CHINA IS PUSHING BACK. WHAT DO WE UNDERSTAND? BRENDAN: CHINA IS SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE U.S. AND ITS TECH COMPANIES AND CHIP PRODUCERS THAT WE MIGHT NOT NEED THESE KINDS OF CHIPS. AND WE ARE GOING TO CAST THESE AS A SECURITY THREAT TO OUR OWN DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES AND THE GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING AS WELL. THIS IS ABOUT TRYING TO SHOW THE U.S. THAT CHINA REALLY HAS LEVERAGE WITH ITS RARE EARTHS, VERSUS WHAT THE U.S. HAS AN THAT ARE THE HIGH-TECH CHIPS. THIS IS ABOUT WHO HAS THE LEVERAGE OVER WHO AND CHINA IS TRYING TO SHOW THAT IT HAS JUST AS MUCH LEVERAGE AS DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE HAS OVER CHINA. DANI: TODAY IN AMERICA IT IS ALSO INFLATION DATA. THERE ARE QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER TARIFF INFLATION HAS STARTED TO SEEP IN. YOU TRACK GLOBAL TRADE CLOSELY. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN TERMS IF COMPANIES ARE DONE STOCKPILING AND FINALLY IMPORTING TARIFF EFFECTIVE GOODS? IT HAS BEEN HARD TO SEE INFLATIONARY EFFECTS IN U.S. ECONOMIC DATA OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. COMPANIES STOCKPILED, SO THEY PURCHASED AND IMPORTED A LOT OF GOODS THAT DID NOT HAVE THE TARIFFS APPLIED TO THEM. THERE IS A REAL UNEVENNESS TO THIS AND YOU HEAR BIG COMPANIES SAY THAT WE ARE ADJUSTING AND WE WILL ABSORB THE COSTS AND WE WILL PASS ON A MINIMAL AMOUNT TO CONSUMERS. THOSE ARE THE BIG COMPANIES. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR REPORTING SINCE THE RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TOOK EFFECT ON THURSDAY IS THAT THESE BILLS ARE COMING DUE TO SMALL COMPANIES. ALL COMPANIES ARE WHAT REALLY DRIVES THE U.S. ECONOMY. WE ARE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT IN THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS REPRESENTED BY THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION. THEY ARE GETTING MORE VOCAL ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO HIT -- TO WITHSTAND THE HIT OF THESE TARIFFS. THE THINKING IS THAT IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF MONTHS. WE ARE PAST THE THREATS OF TARIFFS AND NOW WE ARE SEEING THE RUBBER MEET THE ROAD ON THE REAL ECONOMY. 6:00 A.M. WE WILL GET SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM FIGURES. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET US STAY ON THE INFLATION PLANT -- PRINT. PAUL DONOVAN WRITES HAVING THIS INFLATION -- \"HEDGING THIS INFLATION MIGHT BECOME MORE DIFFICULT. THE SPENDING POWER OF U.S. PHYSICAL GOLD BUYERS WAS HIT BY INFLATION TAXES. INFLATION PROTECTED GOVERNMENT BONDS PROTECTS NOT FROM INFLATION BUT WHAT THE BLS SAYS INFLATION IS.\" PAUL, IT SPEAKS TO THE COMPLICATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, SO HOW VULNERABLE ARE WE AS A MARKET TO STICKIER INFLATION? PAUL: THERE ARE VULNERABILITY, NOT SO MUCH FROM THE DIRECT EFFECT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRADE TAXES, THOSE WILL FEED THROUGH AND WE EXPECT TO SEE THE APRIL TAXES MORE OR LESS SEPTEMBER. THE AUGUST TRADE TAXES WILL HIT CONSUMERS EARLY NEXT YEAR. THE QUESTION IS THE SECOND ROUND EFFECTS. THE U.S. MANUFACTURERS TAKE ADVANTAGE THE RAISE THEIR PRICES AND EXPAND MARGINS. DO WE SEE RETAILERS ENGAGING IN PROFIT LED INFLATION. THERE IS ONE OR TWO WARNING SIGNS THAT THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING. THE MORE THAT THOSE SECOND ROUND EFFECTS COME THROUGH THE STICKIER THE NUMBERS ARE LIKELY TO BE. DANI: DO YOU EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN TO THE DEGREE IT DID DURING COVID. CAN WE USE THAT AS A COROLLARY OF COMPANIES STARTING TO RAISE PRICES OR IS THE CONSUMER MORE RESISTANT TO IT? PAUL: THERE IS MORE RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS SIMPLY BECAUSE CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE THE STOCKPILES OF SAVINGS THAT THEY HAD TWO TO THREE YEARS AGO. NOT TO SAY THAT CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE ANY SAVINGS AND THEY WILL USE THOSE TO SMOOTH OUT CONSTRUCTION AS WAGE GROWTH TURNS NEGATIVE. I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE AS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE PROFIT LED INFLATION STORY. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PROFIT LED EXPLOIT -- INFLATION COME THROUGH. THE ECONOMIC PROFESSIONALS LOOKED A LOT AT BANANA PRICES. GLOBALLY THEY ARE DOWN AND THEY ARE UP IN THE STATES. THAT IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE TARIFFS. BUT, BECAUSE OF THE NARRATIVE AROUND TRADE TAXES WHICH HAS ALLOWED CONSUMER RETAILERS TO INCREASE PRICES A BIT MORE. WE ARE SEEING SOME ASPECTS OF THIS ALREADY. AND IT WILL BE A BIT OF A TUSSLE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BETWEEN RETAILERS LOOKING TO RAISE PRICES AND CONSUMERS LESS WILLING TO SPEND. DANI: IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARLOR GAMES, WHAT DO ECONOMISTS CARE ABOUT, BANANAS OR SHAMPOO? YOU HAVE BEEN OUT FRONT WITH THIS IDEA THAT THE DATA HAS BECOME LESS RELIABLE BECAUSE OF LOWER RESPONSE RATES. IT HAS TAKEN A TWIST WITH TRUMP NOT CLAIMING THAT BUT CLAIMING POLITICS IS BEHIND THAT. WE HAVE A NEW APPOINTMENT TO THE BLS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CHIEF ECONOMIST THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION. DOES IT MAKE THE DATA EVEN MORE CONCERNING, OR IS IT THE SAME OLD PROBLEMS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK THROUGH EVEN THROUGH THE CPI? PAUL: WE HAVE THE SAME OLD PROBLEMS AND IT IS FALLING RESPONSE RATES AND POLARIZED POLITICS WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE GIVE BIASED ANSWERS AND WE ARE MISSING PARTS OF THE NEW ECONOMY. WHERE IN THE LABOR MARKET IS THE TICTAC -- TIKTOK CREATOR. THE BUREAU OF LABOR HAS CUT BACK ON THE MEASURES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. WILL THE NEW APPOINTEE BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE UNDERFUNDING OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AND I RATHER SUSPECT NOT US -- NOT. AND THEN A SERIOUS QUESTION ABOUT WILL THEY INTRODUCE POLITICAL BIASED STATISTICS. THE 2000 INDEPENDENT STATISTICIANS ONE ASSUMES WILL RESIST ATTEMPTS TO POLITICIZE THEM. BUT IF WE DO END UP WITH EVEN A SUFFICIENT A POLITICIZE DATA THAT WILL DO DAMAGE TO THE CREDIBILITY OF U.S. STATISTICS AND PEOPLE WILL SAY YES BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS, WHAT I BELIEVE IS GOING ON WHAT I -- IS WHAT I THINK WITH MY GUT INSTINCT WHICH IS A VERY CHAOTIC ENVIRONMENT FOR FINANCIAL MARKETS. DANI: HAVE YOU STARTED TO USE ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCES? HOW ARE YOU ASSESSING THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND MIGHT YOU CONTINUE GOING FORWARD SHOULD WHAT YOU DESCRIBE HAPPEN? PAUL: HERE IS THE PROBLEM. WE JUDGE THE RELIABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCES BY COMPARING THEM TO OFFICIAL DATA. AND IF OFFICIAL DATA IS UNRELIABLE, WHAT WOULD YOU USE AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCES WITH. NOW, WITH SOME SOURCES YOU ARE DEALING WITH OBJECTIVE FACTS. COUNTING THE NUMBER OF SHIPS OUTSIDE THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES, THAT IS AN OBJECTIVE FACTS. THE INTERPRETATION THAT IT PUTS ON THAT IS SUBJECTIVE. AND THAT IS WHERE THE VULNERABILITY COMES THROUGH. I ALWAYS SUGGEST WHEN SOMEBODY COMES WITH ME AND SAYS WHAT ARE THE THREE KEY INDICATORS I SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AN ECONOMICS. THE ANSWER IS THE SAME. IF YOU ARE ONLY LOOKING AT THREE INDICATORS, YOU WILL LOSE MONEY. YOU CANNOT JUDGE THE WORLD THROUGH A VERY NARROW LENS. WE NEED TO TAKE A BROAD SAMPLE OF INDICATORS TO GET A SENSE OF THE DIRECTION OF THE ECONOMY. ABANDON THE IDEA THAT ECONOMIC DATA IS PRECISE, IT IS NOT. WE CAN GET A SENSE OF THE BROAD DIRECTION USING A WIDE NUMBER OF INDICATORS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF ECONOMISTS. DANI: I LOVE THAT WE POURED COLD WATER OVER THE CPI REPORT IS AT EIGHT: 30 P.M. -- 8:30 A.M. AND YOU SHOULD STILL TUNE IN FOR THOSE RESULTS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET US GET YOU SOME OTHER TOP STORIES THAT ARE TRENDING ON THE TERMINAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP DOWNPLAYED EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AFTER SPECULATION THAT A DEAL FAVORING MOSCOW MIGHT GET CAUGHT. > > THIS IS A FEEL OUT MEETING A LITTLE BIT. AND PRESIDENT PUTIN INVITED ME TO GET INVOLVED. HE WANTS TO GET INVOLVED. I HAVE SAID THAT A FEW TIMES. AND I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED. DANI: BLOOMBERG LEARNING THAT THE SEARCH FOR THE NEXT FED CHAIR IS EXPANDING TO INCLUDE THE CURRENT VICE CHAIRS. MICHELLE BOWMAN AND PHILIP JEFFERSON. AND THEY ARE CONFERRED -- CONFIRMING THAT LORI LOGAN IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR THE ROLE WHEN IT IS VACATED NEXT MAY. ELON MUSK IS SUING APPLE. HE IS ACCUSING APPLE OF MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN OPENAI TO REACH THE TOP OF THE APPLE STORE CHARTS. COMING UP, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NORD JUST INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THAT CONVERSATION COMING UP NEXT. \u266a DANI: WELCOME BACK TO BLOOMBERG BRIEF. THE SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND ENJOYED ITS BEST QUARTER SINCE 2020 THREE, RETURNING SIX POINT 4% THANKS TO GAINS WITHIN THE EQUITY MARKET. JOINING US NOW IS THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CEO, NIKOLAI TANGEN. SOLID RETURNS, BUT THE QUESTION NEEDS TO BE ASKED, WITH STOCKS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH, CONCERNS OF STICKY INFLATION AND ECONOMIC WEAKNESS IN THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS, JUST HOW SUSTAINABLE ARE THOSE LEVELS OF RETURNS? NICOLAI: THIS IS A VERY STRONG QUARTER AND I AM QUITE SURPRISED THAT MARKETS HAVE DONE WELL. THE PARTICULAR THE REBOUND WE HAD SINCE APRIL, IT IS VERY SURPRISING GIVING EVERYTHING GOING ON IN THE WORLD. DANI: IT IS SURPRISING. DO YOU EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE, GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON? HOW RESILIENT ARE WE MOVING FORWARD? NICOLAI: WE HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUS FOR SOME TIME AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE CAUTIOUS. IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IN EUROPE WE HAVE HAD NO EARNINGS GROWTH IN THE FIRST HALF BUT WE HAD A LOT OF EARNINGS GROWTH COMING IN THE U.S., ESPECIALLY U.S. TECH COMPANIES. THE EARNINGS GROWTH IS REALLY DRIVEN FROM THAT PART OF THE MARKET. AND THEN VERY STRONG RETURNS FROM THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. AND SO, IT HAS BEEN RELATIVELY BROAD WITHIN THE AREA. DANI: HOW DOES ONE EVEN BE AND EXPRESS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN VON VOLATILITY HAS CONTINUED TO PICK UP. YOU SEE METALS LIKE GOLD SUBJECT TO INTRADAY FLUCTUATIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE REGARDING TARIFFS. HOW DOES ONE PROTECT YOURSELF IN THIS MORE CAUTIONARY ENVIRONMENT? NICOLAI: IT IS AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE NEED TO BE BROADLY DIVERSIFIED AND LONG TERM BECAUSE IT IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE AROUND YOUR PORTFOLIO WHEN YOU ARE THE SIZE THAT WE ARE. THAT IS BASED ON THE SHORT-TERM MOVEMENTS. THE LONGER TERM AND THE MORE BROADLY DIVERSIFIED THE BETTER YOU WILL BE. DANI: GIVEN YOUR PASSIVE EXPOSURE TO U.S. STOCKS, I KNOW THIS IS NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN BUT ONE COULD ARGUE THAT YOU ARE MORE EXPOSED TO TECH. NVIDIA IS YOUR LARGEST HOLDING. DOES THAT CONCERN YOU AT ALL? NICOLAI: YOU COULD HAVE STARTED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS MANY YEARS AGO AND WHILE YOU HAVE MISSED OUT ON SOME HUGE GAINS. THE WAY WE TALKED ABOUT DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIO SOME YEARS AGO WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT 1% OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS A HUGE HOLDING, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS VERY GOOD THAT WE DID NOT LIMIT THE POSITION SIZE AT THAT STAGE. WHEN WE SEE WHAT AI IS DOING TO OUR FIRM AND THE WAY WE WORK, IT IS INCREDIBLE. LAST YEAR WE CONFRONT -- INCREASE OUR PRODUCTIVITY BY 50% AND THIS YEAR WE CAN INCREASE IT MORE. WE ARE USING IT EVERYWHERE AND IT IS FASCINATING HOW IT IMPROVES AND MAKES THE WORK MORE EFFICIENT. DANI: HOW MUCH OF IT IS INCREASING EFFICIENCY AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS MAKING YOU NEED LESS STAFF? NICOLAI: FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO CUT STUFF BUT DO MORE AND DO BETTER AT WHAT WE ARE DOING. OUR GOAL WAS TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PLAYER IN USING AI IN OUR COUNTRY. AND ALSO, WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. WE WILL NOT LAY OFF PEOPLE, BUT DO THINGS BETTER. DANI: I AM SURE EVERYONE IS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT FOR THOSE LISTENING IN. THESE BIG TECH AND AI PLAYERS ARE STARTING TO BE MORE SUBJECT TO THE POLITICS. NVIDIA AND AMD HAVING TO PAY 15% OF THEIR CHINA REVENUE TO THE U.S. AND CHINA PUSHING BACK SAYING YOU DO NOT USE H20 CHIPS AND THE INTEL CEO GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, DOES THAT CHANGE THE VIEW OF THE COMPANIES THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GETTING CAUGHT IN THE POLITICAL CROSSHAIRS NOT JUST ABROAD BUT IN AMERICA AS WELL. NICOLAI: IT IS SUPER INTERESTING BECAUSE THE VERY CLOSE TIES BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND GEOPOLITICS, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EXPLODED THREE YEARS AGO WITH THE ADVENT OF CHATGPT. NOW OF COURSE YOU HAVE AI BEING BUILT INTO EVERYTHING FROM SELF DRIVING CARS, MEDICAL RESEARCH, WEAPONS AND ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS. SO THE LINK BETWEEN GEOPOLITICS AND TECHNOLOGY IS SO STRONG AND IMPORTANT. YOU NEED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LENS WHEN YOU ANALYZE MARKETS. DANI: HAVE YOU HIRED MORE GEOPOLITICAL ANALYST? HOW ARE YOU HANDLING IT? NICOLAI: WE TRIED TO DO MORE DEEP THINKING AND WE DID IN THE PAST. I THINK YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE RESOURCES INSIDE THAT YOU NEED TO HIRE AT LEAST 50 PEOPLE. WE TRY TO LISTEN TO THE BEST EXPERTS WORLDWIDE, AND THEN AS I SAID, NOT TO BE WIDELY DIVERSIFIED AND HAVE A LONG-TERM VIEW SO WE PARTICIPATE. DANI: HOW MUCH OF THE DIVERSIFICATION IS LOOKING AWAY FROM THE U.S.. EUROPE STOCKS GAINED 17.8% VERSUS 1.4%. AT WHAT -- AT THIS POINT WOULD YOU CONSIDER A GREATER TILT TOWARDS EUROPE? NICOLAI: THERE IS A BIG CURRENCY EFFECT IN THE RESULTS BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS IN THE NORWEGIAN COIN. WE HAVE MORE THAN HALF THE PORTFOLIO IN THE U.S. AND ONE THIRD IN EUROPE. WE ARE HAPPY WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSIFICATION THAT WE HAVE. DANI: IT GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION AND I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED IT BEFORE AND IT HAS NOT GONE AWAY. THE IDEA THAT BRAND AMERICA HAS BEEN HURT WITH THE POLITICAL VOLATILITY HAPPENING IN THE U.S.. DO YOU THINK THAT IS A NARRATIVE THAT COULD GET MORE LEGS THAT AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO RE-EXAMINE JUST HOW MUCH OF THE U.S. THAT YOU HOLD? NICOLAI: IT IS A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. YOU ARE POSING UNCERTAINTY, WHICH IS GENERALLY NOT GOOD FOR STOCK MARKETS AND COMPANIES. SO WHEN WE HAVE UNCERTAINTY, THAT IS NOT THE POSITIVE. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE SEEING VERY STRONG DEVELOPMENTS, WRONG R & D AND INNOVATIONS COMING OUT OF THE LARGE U.S. COMPANIES. WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE HOLDINGS. DANI: WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR HOLDINGS, YOU DIVESTED FROM 11 ISRAELI COMPANIES AND CUT TIES FROM EXTERNAL MANAGERS FROM ISRAEL AMID PRESSURE BEFORE AN ELECTION HAPPENING. IS THERE A REAL RISK THAT CRITICS MIGHT LOOK AT THIS AND SAY IT OPENS THE DOOR TO BEING USED AS A POLITICAL TOOL. IS THAT A REAL RISK? NICOLAI: IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO BE POLITICAL, WE ARE AN INVESTMENT FUND AND WE HAVE ONE GOAL, AND THAT IS TO MAKE MONEY, OF COURSE WITHIN THE MANDATE THAT WE HAVE FROM THE MINISTRY. WE DIVESTED FROM THESE ISRAELI COMPANIES NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE ISRAELI. IN THIS CASE, WE WANTED TO SIMPLIFY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT THAT WE DID IN ISRAEL. THESE WERE COMPANIES NOT IN THE INDEX AND WE DECIDED TO TAKE HOME THE ASSET MANAGEMENT. WE DISCONTINUED THREE EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXTERNAL MANAGERS, AND WE DECIDED TO DO IT OURSELVES TO SIMPLIFY WHAT WE ARE DOING AND HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS. DANI: ARE YOU EVALUATING CHANGES TO SOME OF YOUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY AS PART OF THIS? NICOLAI: WE ARE CONTINUE WAITING -- CONTINUALLY EVALUATING THIS AND WE HAVE A COUNCIL OF ETHICS LOOKING INTO THE ETHICAL ASPECTS OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AND THEN IN TERMS OF BEING INVESTED IN ISRAEL, THAT IS NOT A DECISION THAT WE DO. WE MAKE SURE THAT WE INVEST IN ISRAEL IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. DANI: WE LITERALLY HAVE ONE MINUTE BUT IT WILL BE CPI REPORTS IN AMERICA. ARE YOU GEARING UP FOR A STAGFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT IS YOUR LARGEST HOLDING? NICOLAI: WE DO SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME REAL INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. ONE THING IS OF COURSE COMING FROM THE TARIFFS. AND WE ARE SEEING PUSH FROM VARIOUS SORT OF CLIMATE SITUATIONS WHERE HARVESTS AND RAW MATERIAL PRICES MOVING UP. THAT IS WHY WE THINK THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN CLIMATE RISK AND FINANCIAL RISK. I THINK THE RISK IS FOR SURE A DANGER THAT INFLATION CAN BE RESISTANT. DANI: WONDERFUL TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THAT IS THE CEO OF NORGES BANK. COMING UP, PRIYA SETS THE STAGE AHEAD OF THE INFLATION PRINT COMING UP NEXT ON BLOOMBERG. \u266a DANI: 5:30 A.M. IN NEW YORK CITY. I AM DANI BURGER WITH YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. 90 MORE DAYS, CHINA AND THE U.S. EXTEND THEIR TRADE TRUTHS, AVERTING HIGHER TARIFFS. NEW GUIDANCE ON SHIPS AS LOCAL -- AS CHINA URGES LOCAL JUMP -- COMPANIES TO NOT USE THE H20 PROCESSORS. WE CLOSED ABOUT .2 PRODUCT -- .25% HIGHER. UNCHANGED ON THE S & P AND NASDAQ AND WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PUT ANY RISK ON. THE RUSSELL 2000 DOES OUTPERFORM AND ALSO LITTLE CHANGE THIS MORNING. THE EXPECTATION FOR INFLATION, .3% AND WE GET INTO THAT WITH MICHAEL MCKEE. 4.2750 TWO FOR THE 10-YEAR YIELD. LET US LOOK AT THE MARK -- AT THE STOCKS MOVING PREMARKET. VALERIE: LET US CHECK ON NVIDIA AFTER CHINA URGED COMPANIES NOT TO USE ITS H20 CHIP. NVIDIA IS DOWN .3%. THIS COMES DAYS AFTER THAT NVIDIA GOT THOSE EXPORT LICENSES TO BEGIN EXPORTING THOSE CHIPS INTO CHINA AFTER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT A PAUSE IN APRIL. LET US MOVE ON TO INTEL. A BIT OF A DIFFERENT PICTURE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE U.S. PRESIDENT CHANGED HIS MIND WITH THE CEO AFTER MEETING HIM AND SAYS THAT THE CEO HAS AN AMAZING STORY AND THIS IS HELPING THE STOCK TURNAROUND 3.3% COMING AFTER GAINS OF AROUND 3% AS WELL. A BIG DEPARTURE FROM THE LANGUAGE A FEW DAYS AGO CALLING FOR HIS RESIGNATION. LET US MOVE ON TO EARNINGS. BIGBEAR.AI CAME OUT WITH SOME VERY DEPRESSING NUMBERS WHEN IT CAME TO REVENUE WITH A $.71 LOSS PER SHARE WHEN THE ESTIMATE WAS AROUND 6% -- SIX CENTS. WE ARE SEEING THEM DOWN 28%. THEY HAVE BIG CONTRACTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE U.S. ARMY. DANI: WE ARE THREE HOURS AWAY FROM THE LATEST INFLATION PRINT AND SO LET US BRING IN MICHAEL MCKEE WHO IS AWAITING THAT DATA. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING OUT FOR? MIKE: YOU SAID THAT THE RATE CUT HOPES RIGHT ON THIS AND ORDINARILY I WOULD SAY THIS IS HYPERBOLE, BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS TRUE. IF WE GET A DECENT NUMBER, IT WOULD ENABLE THE FED TO CUT RATES WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT INFLATION RISING. THE QUESTION IS, DO WE GET THAT NUMBER. FOR A HEADLINE WE ARE LOOKING AT A .2% GAIN AND FOR THE CORE, A POINT 3% GAIN THAT WOULD PUSH UP INFLATION ONLY BY A TICK. THE QUESTION IS AND A LOT OF ECONOMISTS ARE THINKING THAT WE MIGHT SEE THE CORE RATE TAKE UP 2.4% AND IF THAT IS THE CASE WE GO OVER 3% AND THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM FOR THE FED BECAUSE INFLATION LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BREAK OUT. EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT THE BREAKDOWN OF WHAT COMES FROM CPI AND LOOKING AT CATEGORIES COULD THAT COULD BE INFLUENCED BY TARIFFS. AND OF COURSE THEY JUST STARTED TO GO ON AND THERE IS MORE TO COME IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE SEPTEMBER MEETING. DANI: AND FROM WHATEVER TRUTH SOCIAL WE MIGHT GET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. BLOOMBERG REPORTING THAT THERE IS AN EXPANDED SEARCH FOR THE FED CHAIR. WHAT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HIS IN THE CANDIDATE LIST. PRIYA: THEY KEEP -- MIKE: THEY KEEP ADDING PEOPLE AT THE FED. THOUGH MEN AND TWO VICE CHAIRS ALONG WITH LORI LOGAN WHO WAS THE DALLAS FED PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF THE MARKETS DESK AT THE NEW YORK FED. HOW SERIOUS THOSE ARE, WE DO NOT KNOW. BLOOMBERG REPORTED THAT CHRIS MALT -- CHRIS WALLER MIGHT BE THE FAVORITE BUT APPARENTLY SCOTT BESSENT WANTS TO INTERVIEW A LOT OF PEOPLE. DANI: ONE JOB WAS SECURED, THE NEW HEAD OF THE BLS SO THE CEI REPORT WILL BE THE FIRST WITH VIJAY AND TONY. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM? PRIYA: MIKE: HE WILL --MIKE: HE WILL NOT BE IN CHARGE BECAUSE HE HAS TO BE CONFIRMED AND IT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE THIS IS CLEARLY A POLITICAL CHOICE. HE HAS SET A A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE BLS IN THE PAST, MUCH OF THEM ON X, THAT THE BLS DATA IS JUST A RANDOM AND UNDER -- NUMBER GENERATOR AND THE REVISIONS THAT WE SAW IN THE JOBS REPORT SHOWING NEGATIVE BIAS AND HE HAS QUESTIONS THEIR METHODOLOGIES AND SAY THEY NEED A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF HOW THEY DO THINGS. NOW THE COMMISSIONER DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE ON THE DAY-TO-DAY COLLECTION OF STATISTICS, BUT HE COULD RAISE QUESTIONS AS WE GO FORWARD ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY. IN THE PRESIDENT SAY THEY WANT TO BRING BACK TRUST TO THE NUMBERS. BUT WALL STREET HAS NOT LOST TRUST IN THE NUMBERS. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE STATISTICAL PROBLEMS BUT THAT IS SEEN AS THE GOLD STANDARD. THE PRESIDENT MIGHT WANT TO CONCEDE VIEWS PEOPLE SO THAT PEOPLE WILL WORRY ABOUT THE NUMBERS INSTEAD OF THE BAD JOBS REPORT. DANI: THERE IS NO WAY THE WALL STREET WILL NOT BE TRADING OFF OF THE 8:30 A.M. CPI NUMBERS. THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BREAKING DOWN THE DATA. LET US CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH PRIYA. WE WILL LEAVE THE POLITICS ASIDE AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT SHADES OF STAGFLATION ARE SHOWING UP. DO YOU EXPECT TODAY TO CONFIRM THAT? PRIYA: I DO AND I EXPECT TO SEE IT IN GOODS INFLATION. AND WE SOUGHT LAST MONTH. YOU WILL SEE MORE OF THAT AND MORE TARIFFS HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT. THIS IS NOT THE PEAK OF INFLATION BUT I THINK THIS WILL HAPPEN THROUGH THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER AND YOU WILL SEE GOODS INFLATION. BEYOND THAT HEADLINE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE SECOND-PLACE DECIMAL. WE SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT SERVICES. YOU ARE SEEING THE STACK -- SEEING THE STAGFLATION SIDE ON GOODS SO WHAT ARE WE SEEING ON SERVICES? WE ARE SEEING SERVICE INFLATION LARGELY OFFSET GOODS INFLATION. IF SERVICE INFLATION CONTINUES TO DECELERATE IT DOES A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT TELLS US THAT THE STAG PART OF STAGFLATION IS STILL AND LIVE, A LOT OF THAT IS DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IF CONSUMERS SPEND MORE AND GIRLS THAT -- GOODS THEY CUT BACK ON SERVICES. IF WE LOOK AT DATA QUALITY LET US LOOK AT A BROAD SWATH. WE ARE SEEING REAL CONSUMPTIONS AND EXPENDITURES. THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WAS 1% RUNNING AT 3% LAST YEAR. THERE IS A SLOWING AND SPENDING. IT TELLS YOU THAT THE DEMAND SIDE IS SLOWING AND ALLOWS THE FED TO LOOK THROUGH THAT TARIFF INFLATION. THAT IS WHAT EVERY MARKET IS LOOKING FOR, CAN THE FED CUT RATES AND MAYBE THERE IS A KNEE-JERK REACTION THAT THIS NUMBER IS HOT. THEY MIGHT LOOK THROUGH TARIFF RELATED INFLATION AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. MY CONCERN IS IF SERVICE INFLATION DOES NOT DECELERATE DOES THE FED GET NERVOUS THAT WHAT IF THIS INFLATION IS LIKE THE 21 INFLATION. I DO THINK IT IS DIFFERENT. BUT I THINK WE WILL BE WATCHING THAT SERVICE SIDE TO SEE WHETHER THE FED CAN LOOK THROUGH IT OR NOT. DANI: IT SOUNDS LIKE A MANDATE ALREADY IN CONFLICT AT THIS VERY POINT. WAS IT ALREADY PREMATURE FOR THE MARKET TO PRICE SOMETHING CLOSE TO A 90% ODD THAT WE GET A CUT? PRIYA: WE AREN'T WHERE -- WE ARE IN THE POINT WHERE THE DUAL MANDATE IS IN TENSION. I THINK THE STARTING POINT WAS THE FED WAS IN RESTRICTIVE TERRITORY. FOR THE MARKET TO PRICE IN RATE CUTS, BEYOND THE POLITICS. YOU LISTEN TO GOVERNOR WALLER AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT LET US REDUCE THE LEVEL OF RESTRICTION WHICH IS 100 OR 150 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS. I THINK THOSE ARE FAIR. WHETHER IT HAPPENS IN SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER OR DECEMBER THE FACT -- DEPENDS ON THE NEXT PAYROLL REPORT BUT THE FED IS AND EASING BIAS. I THINK THE MARKETS ARE PRICING THAT EASING BIAS AND WHAT THE MARKET IS NOT YET PRICING AND IS MOVING TO ACCOMMODATION. THE GROWTH CONTINUE TO SLOW DOWN WE GO FROM THE LOW FIRE AND LOW HIRE, TO ACTUAL HIGHER FIRE. IF YOU SEE CLAIMS PICK UP THAN THE MARKET PRICES AND A LOT OF CUTS. WHAT WE ARE PRICING AND IS THE IDEA THAT IT IS A TARIFF RELATED RISE IN INFLATION AND GROWTH IS SLOWING BUT NOT INTO RECESSION. JEROME POWELL SEEMED OPEN TO IT. HE WAS NOT SUGGESTING A SEPTEMBER RATE CUT BUT HE WAS OPEN TO CUTTING THIS YEAR. THE MARKET IS FAIR IN PRICING GOES IN. AND THAT IS WHY THEY MIGHT LOOK THROUGH ANY HIGH LONGER AS LONG AS IT KEEPS THE NARRATIVE ALIVE THAT THIS IS GOODS INFLATION AND SERVICES ARE GOOD. DANI: THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN SURROUNDING THE LABOR MARKET. THERE IS A RISK OF THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE LESS JOB OPENINGS IS BECAUSE THERE IS LESS SUPPLY AND THAT IS DRIVING IT. A CUP WILL NOT BRING MORE LABOR OF SUPPLY. AND IF ANYTHING IT MIGHT FUEL INFLATION. IS THAT A REAL RISK? PRIYA: THE LABOR MARKET IS TRICKY BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DECLINE IN DEMAND AND COMPANIES ARE HIRING LESS AND THE SUPPLY SIDE IS SLOWING. AND THAT IS WHY CHAIR POWELL SAID THE LABOR NUMBERS ARE SLOWING, BUT SO THE SUPPLY REMAINS IN BALANCE. AND SO YOU ARE ASKING TWO QUESTIONS. AS THE LABOR MARKET WEEK? I THINK IT IS ON EDGE. HIRING IS SLOWING AND YOU LOOK AT OVERALL DEMAND SIDE IS SLOWING. I THINK THE FED -- THE FED SHOULD REDUCE THE LEVEL OF RESTRICTION. THE SECOND QUESTION, IT DOES NOT HELP. MONETARY POLICY WORKS WITH FLAGS AND IT WILL TAKE A WHILE. IF YOU NEED GROWTH TO PICK UP YOU NEED TO MOVE INTO ACCOMMODATIVE TERRITORY. I AM NOT CONFIDENT THAT IF THE FED CUTS RATES DEMAND PICKS UP. WE DO HAVE SOME POSITIVES OF SOME UNCERTAINTY GOES AWAY. YOU HAVE SOME OF THE POLICIES FROM THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL AND IS THAT A POSITIVE? BUSINESSES ARE COMING IN WITH VERY SOLID BALANCE SHEETS SO MAYBE WE CAN STAY IN THE SOFT LANDING AND THAT IS THE BASE CASE SCENARIO WHICH IS WHY WE ARE LEANING INTO CREDIT AND HIGH-QUALITY SPREAD PRODUCT BUT YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF THINGS ARE SLOWING DOWN THESE RATE CUTS WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO GET US OUT OF IT, WHICH ONLY DURATION MAKES SENSE. DANI: IT FEELS CRAZY TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET WEAKENING, AND YET SPREADS ARE INCREDIBLY TIGHT AND STOCKS ARE JUST BELOW ALL-TIME HIGHS. IS IT A WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD SITUATION OR ARE WE COMPLACENT? PRIYA: THERE IS SOME ELEMENT OF THAT BUT THE MARKET IS LOOKING AT TOP-DOWN DATA SHOWING SLOWING BUT NOT RECESSION. BOTTOM-UP DATA, LOOK AT COMPANY EARNINGS AND BALANCE SHEETS. COMPANIES ARE SOLID AND THEY ARE NOT SUGGESTING THEY NEED TO LAY OFF. THE MARKET IS PRICING THAT SCENARIO. AND THE HOPE THAT THERE IS A TRUMP AND FED PUT. THE FED IS TELLING YOU AND IF YOU LOOK AT BOTH SIDES THAT THE PUT IS IN THE MARKET'S MIND. THERE IS A NON-THAN HE ALREADY. IF THINGS SLOW DOWN DOES IT SLOW DOWN WHERE THINGS GET ENOUGH -- A LOT WERE -- WORSE AND IT TAKES A WILD TO PLAY OUT? YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE GETTING INFLOWS. EQUITIES ARE DOING SO WELL BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE BUYING 5.5 OR 6% CORPORATE DEBT? IT IS GIVING THEM A QUESTION WHERE IF THINGS SLOW DOWN RISK PREMIUMS RISE IN THE RATES CAN FALL. INTEREST RATES ARE IN A SLOWDOWN SCENARIO AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO FALL. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE PILING INTO FIXED INCOME ALONG WITH THEIR EQUITIES AS A HEDGE. THAT IS VERY MUCH ALIVE AND WELL. DANI: THANK YOU FOR GETTING IN EARLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. COMING UP, TRUCE EXTENDED. THE U.S. CAUSING HIGHER TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS FOR ANOTHER DAY'S -- ANOTHER 90 DAYS. WE WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION COMING UP NEXT. \u266a > > WE HAVE BEEN DEALING VERY NICELY WITH CHINA AS YOU HAVE HEARD. THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS TARIFFS THAT THEY ARE PAYING TO THE UNITED STATES. THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY GOOD WITH PRESIDENT XI AND MYSELF. DANI: PRESIDENT TRUMP TOUTING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH XI JINPING. THE U.S. EXPANDING HIGHER TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS AT LEAST ATTEMPTING TO STABILIZE TIES. JOINING US FOR MORE IS BRENDAN MURRAY. ANOTHER 90 DAYS. BRANDON: THIS GIVES MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE AMERICAN IMPORTERS AND OTHERS A BIT OF A RELIEF. THIS WAS PRETTY WIDELY EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD EXTEND THIS. THIS SEEMS TO BE THE NEW NORMAL. THESE THREE MONTHS INCREMENTS WHERE BEIJING AND WASHINGTON WILL GET TOGETHER AND HAVE THE TALKS. SECRETARY BESSENT HAS LED THEM AND THEY WILL TRY TO MAINTAIN THIS GOING FORWARD ON THE ROAD TO SOME SORT OF DEAL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO STRIKE WITH PRESIDENT XI JINPING. AND SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE PHASE ONE DEAL THAT TRUMP SIGNED WITH XI IN THE FIRST TERM IN THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THAT. WE TOOK THREE MONTHS TO KIND OF GET TO JUST AN AGREEMENT TO EXTEND THE TRUCE. IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE MAKING BIG PROGRESS IN ANY HEATED OR NEGOTIATIONS. PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS CHINA TO BUY MORE SOYBEANS AND WE HAVE HEARD NOTHING FROM CHINA ON THAT. BUT, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE IS NO ESCALATION AND THE TWO SIDES WILL CONTINUE TO TALK AND AS LONG AS THEY ARE TALKING THEY ARE NOT RAISING TARIFFS ON EACH OTHER. DANI: IS IT ENOUGH OF A RELIEF FOR COMPANIES IN AMERICA THAT BRING IN GOODS FOR CHINA. IS ANOTHER 90 DAYS ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM THE CERTAINTY TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OR DOES CAN KICKING HURT CORPORATE AMERICA'S PURCHASING PLANS? BRENDAN: THE ONLY THING THAT IS CERTAIN IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEXT 90 DAYS IS THAT TARIFFS ARE NOW A REALITY RATHER THAN A THREAT. THEY ARE NOT JUST ON GOODS FROM CHINA, BUT THEY ARE ON 50% FROM INDIA. 15 FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS THE END OF THE THREATS AND THE IMPACT ON THE REAL ECONOMY. AND WHETHER THAT LEADS TO INFLATION OR STALLING OUT OF INVESTMENT, WE DO NOT KNOW. THE COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK SAID BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH QUARTER WE WILL SEE A ROARING TRUMP ECONOMY AND WE ARE NOT TOO FAR FROM THAT PREDICTION AND NONE OF -- NOTHING IN THE U.S. ECONOMY SEEMS TO BE ROARING, THINGS SEEM TO BE SLOWING. DANI: THAT IS BRENDAN MURRAY AND LET US STAY WITH CHINA AND TRADE. BEIJING IS URGING LOCAL COMPANIES TO AVOID USING NVIDIA'S H20 PROCESSORS AFTER THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CLEARED THEM TO SALE PROVIDED THAT IT AND AMD SHARE 15% OF THE SALES. ED LUDLOW IS UP FOR US. IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU. THE ROCK AND A HARD PLACE THAT NVIDIA FINDS ITSELF AND IS INCREASING WITH THE LATEST OUT OF CHINA. HOW BIG OF A SETBACK MIGHT THIS BE? ED: PROBABLY SOME RECALCULATION OF HOW IMMEDIATE TERM NVIDIA'S ABILITY TO DRAW A REVENUES WILL BE, IN PART BECAUSE NVIDIA WAS REALLY CLEAR WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN CONFIRMING THE 15% REVENUE SHARE DEAL. THEY HAVE NOT SHIPPED ANY H20'S TO CHINA IN 2025. THE ANALYST COMMUNITY INTERPRETS THIS AS A TACTIC FROM CHINA IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PUSH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO ASK -- TO OPEN ACCESS FOR JUST FURTHER FOR ACCELERATORS THAT GO BEYOND WHAT H20 IS CAPABLE OF OR SAFEGUARD THEIR OWN DOMESTIC CHAMPIONS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, NVIDIA HAS NOT HAD ACCESS TO THE CHINA MARKET FOR SOME TIME. THE REPORTING WE DID OVERNIGHT PREDATES THE EVENTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NORMAL, PARTICULARLY FOR CHINA'S INTERNET WATCHDOG WHICH IS TO CAUTION ENTITIES FROM USING FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY IF THERE IS A CONCERT -- A SECURITY CONCERN. DANI: WE CONTINUE TO SEE MORE INVOLVEMENT FROM BOTH GOVERNMENTS IN TECH COMPANIES. INTEL IS THE LATEST AND WE HEARD WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT THE CEO STEPPING DOWN. HE PUT THIS ON TRUTH SOCIAL. \"THAT MEETING WAS A VERY INTERESTING ONE. HIS SUCCESS AND RISE IS AN INTERESTING STORY.\" HOW IS THIS RELATIONSHIP EVOLVING? ED: QUICKLY. THINGS HAVE TURNED IN TERMS OF THE PRESIDENT'S PUBLIC COMMENTARY ABOUT HIM. ON PAPER, INTEL IS EVERYTHING THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUSHING FOR. A U.S. COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN TRYING IN ADVANCE, THEY WERE A GREAT BENEFICIARY OF THE CHIPS ACT, TO BRING A LARGER MANUFACTURING OF SEMICONDUCTOR FOOTPRINT. THEY HAVE POORLY EXECUTED ON THAT AND THAT IS AND UNDERSTAND MEN. -- UNDERSTATEMENT. WHAT HE HAS HAD TO DO AWAY FROM HIS BACKGROUND IN CHINA AND HAS BEEN KNOWN BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY EVEN IF IT WAS A SURPRISE OF THE PRESIDENT IS TO GET INTEL OPERATIONALLY FIRING AND IT SEEMS THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TALKING AT CABINET LEVEL AND INTEL MIGHT MOVE AS QUICKLY AS INTEL HAT -- AS NVIDIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO MOVE TO ONSHORE WHAT IS A BIG CAPACITY. BUT HAVING THE PRESIDENT IN THEIR CORNER HAS BEEN HELPFUL. DANI: AWAY FROM POLITICS, BUT NOT THAT FAR AWAY, WE HAVE THE ACCUSATION FROM ELON MUSK THAT APPLE WAS UNFAVORABLY FAVORING OPENAI AS OPPOSED TO XAI. ED: THERE ARE SEVERAL POSTS AND THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE TO WAKE UP TO. THE CORE OF THE ACCUSATION IS THAT APPLE POSITIVELY ALTERS OR INFLUENCES THE RANKINGS ON TOP AND THE APP STORY. MUSK'S ACCUSATION IS BECAUSE THAT APPLE HAS AN UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY RELATIONSHIP WITH OPENAI, THEY USE ITS MODELS AND HAVE A DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, THAT SOMEHOW CHATGPT IS GETTING MORE FAVORABLE TREATMENT THAN XAI AND GROK. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS BECAUSE APPLE IS NOT COMMENTING IS THAT APPLE'S TOP THREE PAID FOR APPS ARE DICTATED BY AN ALGORITHM THAT TAKES ACCOUNT DOWNLOADS OVER TIME, VOLUME AND METADATA THAT DID -- THAT THE DEVELOPERS PUT INTO THE UNDERLYING CODE. THAT IS AS FAR AS WE HAVE GOD. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON IS -- FOR MUSK TO BE LITIGIOUS IN DEFENDING OR GOING ON THE OFFENSE FOR HIS BROAD PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. DANI: AREN'T YOU LUCKY TO BE IN LONDON SO YOU GET TO BE AWAKE TO HIS MIDNIGHT TREAT -- MIDNIGHT TWEETS. YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG. \u266a DANI: YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANI BURGER IN NEW YORK. OPEC IS SET TO RELEASE THEIR MONTHLY OIL MARKET REPORT THIS MORNING AND THEN IT IS THE BIG ONE. U.S. CPI AT 8:30 A.M. EASTERN TIME AND THEN FED SPEAK FROM BARGAIN AND SUBMIT -- BARKIN AND SCHMID. NVIDIA, LITTLE CHANGE DESPITE THE FACT THAT CHINA REPORTEDLY IS TELLING COMPANIES TO PULL BACK ON THEIR PURCHASING OF H20 PROCESSORS DESPITE THE FACT THEY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. INTEL UP 3% AFTER THE CEO MET WITH TRUMP AND HAD POSITIVE POSTS ABOUT THAT. THAT IS IT FOR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. SURVEILLANCE TAKES THINGS FROM HERE. \u266a",

Meanwhile, the stock market remains largely unchanged, with the S & P and NASDAQ unmovated.
