The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration's focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration's view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump's immigration crackdown. ''This year's reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,'' the State Department said. The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries. The reports were delayed by the Trump administration's changes The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to ''adjust'' the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses. ''Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,'' the overview said. ''On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.'' Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.\n\nThe new reports ''reveal a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe,'' Amnesty International said in a statement. The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation. The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says ''there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses'' in El Salvador in 2024 and that ''the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.'' Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.\n\nHowever, for Eswatini \u2014 a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland \u2014 South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States. In all three countries, the reports noted ''significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment \u2026 serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers' freedom of association.'' Those governments ''did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,'' the reports said. Singling out the treatment of white South Africans South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation ''significantly worsening.'' The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country's apartheid government. That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.\n\nWith the signing of that law in December, the report said that ''South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.'' It also said the government ''did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.'' This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners. The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies ''worsened during the year.'' The executive summaries for each of the three reports say ''significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.''",
