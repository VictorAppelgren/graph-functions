  "title": "This Is The Mystery Flavor of McDonald's New Pink and Blue Shake",
  "description": "The crazy-colorful shake is part of the McDonaldland Meal, which is like a (pricey) Happy Meal for adults. And now I know the flavor.",
  "content": "I tried the McDonaldland Meal at my local McD's on Tuesday, the day it came out. And I don't want to say that I've been thinking about the mystery flavor of its pink-and-blue Mt. McDonaldland shake ever since, because that would make me sound truly bizarre, but...I have pondered it.\n\nWhen I tasted the shake, I guessed it was maybe blue raspberry, maybe cotton candy, maybe mixed berry. It's sweet but not sickeningly so, though I'd never order it again. (I'm a chocolate fan.)\n\nBut I kind of wanted to know what the mystery flavor was. And now I do: According to McDonald's Canada's own nutrition page for the shake, the blue beauty features a \"mix of creamy vanilla soft serve and raspberry flavored syrup.\" (I tried to confirm this on the US nutrition page, but it just spun and spun and never loaded. Get on that, Ronald.)\n\nRASPBERRY! The Mt. McDonaldland shake is raspberry flavor! And it's blue in color, so my guess of blue raspberry was correct! Raspberry is the hot fast-food flavor these days, as Starbucks just brought back its much-loved raspberry drink syrup in late July.\n\nIf you're wondering what I'm even talking about, McDonald's continues to capitalize on the love of its customers for the company's goofy history. Recently, Happy Meals included McDonald's-themed toys -- such as drink machines, fryers and trays with food on them -- delivered in mini-Happy Meal boxes. And the much-longed-for Snack Wraps finally returned after a viral fan campaign.\n\nThe McDonaldland Meal goes straight after that market of adults who have a nostalgic feeling for the Golden Arches. It's not cheap -- here in high-cost-of-living Seattle, the medium meal was $16.59 and the large was $18.29.\n\nDon't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\n\nYou can choose from a Quarter Pounder with cheese or a 10-piece McNugget order. It also comes with the chain's famous french fries and your choice of drink. But the specialty drink that's made to go with the meal is called that mystery-until-now-flavored Mt. McDonaldland shake, and it's a blazing blue color, topped with hot pink whipped cream. It's supposed to look like a volcano, with the pink cream as lava, I guess.\n\nYou can order the shake without the meal if you just want to try it. If you don't want to try it, you can choose a regular drink or another flavor of shake with your McDonaldland meal.\n\nRead more: Review: McDonald's Minecraft Meals Feature The Hottest Nugget Sauce Ever\n\nI sampled the hot pink whipped cream by itself, and it seemed to have no flavor, so maybe they just took regular whipped cream and dyed it pink.\n\nInstead of a simple toy, the McDonaldland Meal comes with a 5-by-7-inch tin with one of the McDonaldland mascot characters on it. I ended up with Hamburglar, who, after Grimace, would probably have been my choice.\n\nTins come embossed with Hamburglar, Grimace, Ronald McDonald, Mayor McCheese, Birdie the Early Bird and the Fry Guys. Honestly, I'm not sure what anyone would do with this tin, but it was definitely a classier included item than most of the Happy Meal toys.\n\nInside the tin is a card with a code you can scan to explore McDonaldland online, an ID card for your particular character, two postcards and four stickers. One of my stickers said \"robble robble,\" the Hamburglar's favorite saying, and one read, \"Keep up! Hamburglar and I are mid-heist.\" I can't really imagine anyone putting these on their water bottle or laptop, but to each their own.\n\nHonestly, unless McDonald's nostalgia is your thing, I'd recommend you just stick to ordering your usual at the Golden Arches and skipping the meal. But if you just don't get enough blue and pink food in your life -- and who does? -- try the Mt. McDonaldland shake once, pass it around to let your friends make them guess the flavor before you smugly deliver the big reveal, and then go back to chocolate or another good old standard flavor.",

      "text": "The children yearn for the mines. That was proven early in April when A Minecraft Movie shattered box-office expectations, scooping up a whopping $157 million at the box office.\nThis was already obvious to me on April 1, when I spotted kids at my local McDonald's streaming out the door with the new Minecraft-themed Happy Meal boxes. It's all a promotion for the movie, drawing inspiration from the popular video game available across platforms including Xbox, Nintendo Switch and mobile phones. So, of course, I had to try everything they offered and report back. And I think my tongue is still burning days later. That Nether Flame Sauce is no joke.\nAnd the Minecraft meals seem to be giving Ronald and company a boost. According to Nation's Restaurant News, \"visits to the Golden Arches jumped by 12.2% following the promotion's launch versus year-to-date average Tuesday visit counts.\"\nA representative for McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRead more: McDonald's Launches Minecraft Happy Meals, Plus a 'Nether' Hot Sauce for Nuggets\nHappy Meals: 12 toys, digital game, Creeper box\nYou know what a Happy Meal is. It's a boxed kids meal with a toy, where the kid can choose between a hamburger, cheeseburger, or 4-piece or 6-piece chicken McNuggets. Fries, apples and a drink also come with it.\nFor this promotion, even the Happy Meal box is Minecraft-themed. Personally, I think the Happy Meal boxes are much cuter than the themed boxes that come with the adult Minecraft Movie Meal. My Happy Meal box looked the familiar green Minecraft monsters called Creepers, but this Creeper has kind of a furry look, like it was a cousin of Sesame Street's green Muppet Oscar the Grouch\nBut it's the toy, sorry -- \"figurine\", that will have kids making multiple trips to their local McD's. There are 12 different toys. Mine was marked \"#1, grass block and llama.\" When you open the box the toy comes in, you might think the llama was left behind, because the toy itself is a closed green grass block. But you can open the block and inside is a little llama figurine, permanently attached to one side of the block.\nThe box my toy came in shows the other options you might get. There are six different block-and-creature toys, like the one I got, and six slightly bigger figurines that don't come inside a block. And the walls of the block are kind of like puzzle pieces. You can take the block apart and lay its walls flat and connect them. So if you get more toys, you can make a little playmat of them all, and even attach the six slightly bigger figures, because their bases fit the \"puzzle.\"\nRead more: Does 'A Minecraft Movie' Have a Post Credit Scene? Let's Break It Down\nThe little toy box in each Happy Meal also comes with a scannable code on one side to unlock a digital game where players can complete a quest in the Minecraft Movie world. I tried it, and it's actually more fun than a free mini-game from a fast food eatery has any right to be. Good job, Ronald.\nMinecraft Movie Meal: McD-themed toys, in-game bonus item, Gold Block box\nMcDonald's also was smart enough to know that adults like collectibles too, and that they might have bigger appetites. So the fast food chain is also offering a Minecraft Movie Meal -- kind of like a bigger Happy Meal. Choose a Big Mac or 10-piece Chicken McNuggets, with fries and a drink.\nThe boxes for these meals are like larger Happy Meal boxes. But instead of being Creeper-themed, the one I got was designed to look like a Minecraft gold block. While I prefer the Creeper, it's smart that the adult meal and kid meal boxes are themed differently.\nAnd then, the toy. The grownup meal toy was a big letdown compared to the Happy Meal toy options. While the Happy Meal toys were actual Minecraft characters, the ones in the adult meals are McDonald's mascots created with that blocky, Minecraft look. The figurines have a bit of a twist -- with the toys including a Grimace Egg and Zombie Hamburglar. Mine was called Birdie Wings, and is based on Birdie the Early Bird, a mascot McDonald's introduced in 1980 to promote its then-new breakfast items.\nEach figure, including my Birdie Wings, comes with a shiny card with that figure's image. You scan the QR code on the card to unlock a matching item in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.\nNether Flame Sauce is hot, hot, hot\nMaybe the most fun part of the McDonald's-Minecraft promotion is a new chicken McNugget dipping sauce called the Nether Flame Sauce. It's named for the Minecraft underworld, and I think it's the hottest sauce McDonald's has ever used. You don't have to buy the Minecraft Movie Meal or Happy Meal to get the sauce. If you want to try it with fries or something else, you can order the Nether Flame Sauce with any purchase.\nI'm a fan of hot sauces of all sorts. While Nether Flame Sauce isn't one of the hottest hot sauces I've ever tried, it's definitely the hottest McDonald's dipping sauce I've ever tried, and I practically made a career out of reporting on the Rick and Morty Szechuan sauce.\nThere's a definite kick to this sauce, which looks like Thai red chili sauce but is less sweet and more spicy. The ingredient list on the sauce packet says it includes chili peppers, cayenne peppers, vinegar, sugar, garlic, apricot concentrate and more. I had an extra sauce packet, and my husband devoured it with leftover French fries.\nFinal Minecraft-McDonald's thoughts\nAlthough I have no idea if the upcoming A Minecraft Movie is any good, I feel comfortable grading this McD-Minecraft promotion with a big fat \"A.\"\nI'm not reviewing the non-Nether sauce foods in the meals. It's McDonald's. You know what it tastes like.\nThe boxes are cute. There's a meal for kids and one for adults. The toys are creative and fun, though in my mind the tiny Happy Meal toys are far more fun to collect than the McDonald's mascot ones that come in the adult meal.\nAnd best of all, the Nether Flame sauce is a fun, spice-filled change of pace for those of us who don't mind a fiery dipping option.\ud83d\udd25"

      "text": "McDonald's Snack Wraps, a chicken-tortilla entree that's been missing from US locations of the Golden Arches, flew back into US restaurants on July 10 -- and after all this build-up, I had to try both flavor varieties right away.\nMcDonald's Snack Wraps first came out in 2006 and were meant to be a chicken item that would appeal to drive-thru customers because they're less messy to eat while traveling. Both of the two varieties include white-meat chicken strips known as McCrispy Strips wrapped in a flour tortilla with shredded cheese and lettuce. McCrispy Strips are a reworked version of a chicken item formerly known as Chicken Selects.\nMcDonald's Ranch Snack Wrap is worth the wait\nIf there's a basic or classic version of the two Snack Wrap varieties offered, it's the Ranch Snack Wrap. It consists of one McCrispy chicken strip wrapped in a flour tortilla, sprinkled with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, and lightly doused with the chain's McCrispy Ranch Sauce.\nHonestly, I was a little worried that the Ranch Snack Wrap wouldn't live up to all the hype. Two days before the McDonald's wraps came out, I tried out the very similar chicken snack wraps at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, another fast-food franchise that's jumped on the snack wrap bandwagon. And they were delicious -- but then, chicken is Popeyes' reason for being. Those wraps were so good, in fact, that I wondered if McDonald's, not a chicken franchise by nature, could possibly compete.\nGood news: The McDonald's Ranch Snack Wrap is delicious, and just about as good as Popeyes' version. You'll notice right away that it's weirdly designed. The tortilla is huge compared to the relatively small chicken piece, and if you don't slide the chicken up your first few mouthfuls will be plain tortilla and little else.\nBut the chicken is fresh and juicy, the cheese and lettuce are decent add-ons and the ranch sauce brings in a creamy taste of herbs and spices that blends well with the chicken. Note that the sauce delivery was kind of hit-or-miss, so you might want to add a shot of your own ranch dressing if you want an even distribution of sauce.\nBut it's McDonald's, not a fancy Michelin-starred eatery, so who expects perfection? If I was eating at McDonald's, I'd order the Ranch Snack Wrap over either a basic burger or a McChicken sandwich every day of the week.\nGrade: A\nMcDonald's Spicy Snack Wrap review: Sauce is the weak spot\nThe Spicy Snack Wrap also features one McCrispy chicken strip inside a flour tortilla, again sprinkled with shredded lettuce and cheese. But this time, the sauce is McDonald's orangey Spicy Pepper Sauce. And that's the problem.\nI love spice, often adding Sriracha or hot honey to my sandwiches, but I actively disliked the McD Spicy Pepper Sauce. It was overly sweet and dominated each mouthful, so while the chicken itself was the same crispy juicy strip as in the Ranch Snack Wrap, its taste was buried. There's no question that it comes with a kick, though -- I was still feeling the heat 20 minutes after lunch.\nIf I ordered McDonald's Snack Wraps again, I'd stick to the Ranch Snack Wraps and pass on the Spicy Snack Wraps. But if you want to try both, I noticed on McDonald's app that you can order a mix-and-match meal including one Ranch Snack Wrap, one Spicy Snack Wrap, fries and a drink.\nGrade: B-\nFans have Snack Wrap fever\nZach Ciampa, who regularly covers new food releases under the social-media handle Snach With Zach, said there's been an intense fan base out there for the wraps.\n\"Regarding McDonald's Snack Wrap, it's by far the most requested item I've ever seen my audience ask or demand to come back,\" he told CNET. \"Not just the most requested in recent memory but the most requested of all time. And that's not limited to McDonald's.\"\nRead more: Review: McDonald's Minecraft Meals Feature The Hottest Nugget Sauce Ever\nCiampa said the only similar fast-food items that come close to the same level of interest are Dairy Queen's S'mores Blizzard and Taco Bell's Caramel Apple Empanada, both of which have made recent returns.\nMcDonald's is riding a viral wave. The fast-food chain's Minecraft Happy Meals and adult Minecraft Meals hit restaurants on April 1 and sold out quickly.\nA recent analysis by VegasInsider.com found that the Snack Wrap was by far the most searched for discontinued McDonald's menu item of 2025.\nWhat you need to know about Snack Wraps\nRelease date and time: The Snack Wraps are at participating McDonald's now. You can order on the McDonald's app, in restaurants, or in drive-thrus.\nPrice: At my local restaurant, Snack Wraps are priced at $3 apiece and a meal including fries and a drink was listed at $12. Prices may vary by location, A co-worker said Snack Wrap meals were $10.50 at his New York City McDonald's.\nVarieties: You can order a Snack Wrap in Spicy, which features a habanero-pepper kick, or Ranch, which features a burst of cool ranch sauce."
