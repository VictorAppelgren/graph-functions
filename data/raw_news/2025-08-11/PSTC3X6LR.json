  "content": "PRESSURE is building on Labour to sack the UK\u2019s trade envoy to Turkey following his visit to northern Cyprus \u2013 despite Britain not recognising it.\n\nAfzal Khan, the Labour MP for Manchester Rusholme, is in the self-declared state for a \u2018series of official engagements\u2019 and has met the leader.\n\nBut the British Government does not recognise the breakaway territory which Ankara controls following its invasion of the island 50 years ago.\n\nThe trip has prompted fury, with the National Federation of Cypriots in the UK which represents more than 300,000 British citizens of Cypriot origin calling for his dismissal.\n\nWendy Morton, the shadow foreign affairs minister, wrote to her counterpart Stephen Doughty yesterday to question why Mr Khan was still in the envoy role.\n\n\u2018This visit risks undermining the UK\u2019s credibility as a guarantor power and as an impartial interlocutor in settlement negotiations,\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018It also sends a worrying signal to UK citizens of Cypriot heritage, many of whom were displaced from the very areas that Mr Khan visited.\n\n\u2018I am concerned at the diplomatic, legal and ethical implications of this visit.\u2019\n\nMs Morton asked whether anyone in Government was aware of the trip and whether any official advice was sought before it took place.\n\nShe noted that he flew into the territory via Ercan airport which she said was unlawful under international agreements, as would recognising the area.\n\nShe added: \u2018In light of these events, I would also ask what consideration is being given to Mr Khan\u2019s continued role as UK Trade Envoy to Turkey.\u2019\n\nAsked about his visit yesterday, the Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said it was in a \u2018personal capacity\u2019, adding that the UK did not recognise Northern Cyprus.\n\nOnly Turkey recognises the self-declared \u2018Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u2019 as an independent nation.\n\nGreek Cypriots regard it as a rogue state and have called for the 30,000 Turkish troops stationed there to leave.\n\nThe National Federation of Cypriots in the UK has sent a letter to the UK Government questioning Mr Khan\u2019s visit to the \u2018Turkish-occupied\u2019 areas of Cyprus.\n\nIt has called for his dismissal due to a \u2018blatant violation\u2019 of international law and longstanding UK policy.\n\nDame Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, has also called for his resignation over the \u2018worrying signal\u2019 sent by his trip.\n\nTurkey invaded in 1974 during a coup by the junta in Greece to unite the island with the mainland.\n\nFifty years on, Cyprus remains in stasis following the bloody conflict which divided the island.\n\nA Government spokesperson said: \u2018The visit to the north of Cyprus was undertaken in a personal capacity.\n\n\u2018There is no change to the Government\u2019s long-standing position regarding the so-called \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d.\u2019\n\nGovernment sources said that due to the trip being a personal visit, the Government was not aware of the trip in advance.",
