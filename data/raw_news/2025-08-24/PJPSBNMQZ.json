  "description": "Taylor Swift just secured a spot inside the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 stadium \u2014 and it\u2019s not in the luxury box. A framed photo of the pop star has been added to Arrowhead Stadium\u2019s press room, alongside team snapshots and historic moments from the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl-winning run.

  "content": "Taylor Swift just secured a spot inside the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 stadium \u2014 and it\u2019s not in the luxury box.\n\nA framed photo of the pop star has been added to Arrowhead Stadium\u2019s press room, alongside team snapshots and historic moments from the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl-winning run. The image, taken during the January 2024 playoff game against the Miami Dolphins, now hangs where players and coaches address the media.\n\u2022 None Insiders Claim This Moment Changed Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce's Mindset on Having Kids\n\nHere\u2019s what makes it unusual: no other NFL partner has ever received this kind of recognition. The Chiefs\u2019 Hall of Honor is reserved for players, coaches, and executives \u2014 not wives, girlfriends, or celebrity plus-ones. Gisele B\u00fcndchen, who defined NFL WAG culture for more than a decade, never made it onto a stadium wall in New England. Brittany Mahomes, who has been front and center through Patrick Mahomes\u2019 dynasty years, hasn\u2019t either. Swift truly seems to be the first.\n\nThe reasoning isn\u2019t mysterious. Swift isn\u2019t just Travis Kelce\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 she\u2019s a corporate juggernaut. Her presence at games added an estimated $331.5 million in brand value to the NFL last season, according to Apex Marketing via Front Office Sports. Ratings among women 18\u201349 jumped 63% during her first appearance at a Chiefs game, while teenage girls tuning in spiked 53%, per Sports Illustrated. Even Kelce\u2019s jersey sales reportedly rose 400% in the days after she went public at Arrowhead.\n\nThat makes her framed photo less a sweet nod and more a business calculation. It also creates a delicate contrast with Brittany Mahomes, one of Swift\u2019s most high-profile WAG friends. The women have been inseparable at games, at the U.S. Open, and on double dates with Patrick and Travis, even weathering political differences after Brittany voiced support for Donald Trump in 2024. But when it comes to legacy, only one of them is literally on the wall.\n\nFans, naturally, found a Taylor-coded spin. One viral post pointed out a lyric from her 2014 track \u201cYou Are In Love\u201d: \u201cAnd he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown.\u201d For Kelce, Arrowhead is the office \u2014 and now Swift\u2019s photo is officially on the wall.\n\nThat lyric may frame it as romance, but the real story is economics. The NFL didn\u2019t suddenly decide to honor wives and girlfriends; it decided to immortalize the cultural force who turned one season of Chiefs football into a billion-dollar business story. Brittany stays in the box. Taylor, fittingly, gets the office real estate. And when you already own eight homes, what\u2019s one more prime piece of property?\n\nBefore you go, click here to see which celebrities own the most homes around the world.\n\u2022 None 52 Celebrity Couples Who Aren't Afraid of a Little PDA\n\u2022 None 32 Best Teen Movies From the 2000s That Still Hold Up\n\u2022 None 14 Documentaries About Real-Life Cults That Will Blow Your Mind\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.

      "text": "Everybody knows Taylor Swift has had a massive impact on the NFL this year, and many might be wondering exactly how to measure it. Now, some of the results are in.\nSwift has generated an equivalent brand value of $331.5 million for the Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL, Apex Marketing Group tells Front Office Sports. That number, calculated Jan. 22, comes from print, digital, radio, TV, highlights, and social media mentioning Swift going back to her first game on Sept. 24, then figuring out the equivalent dollar value for each instance based on reach and impact. Online news and digital content has created the most value, followed by social media, Apex president Eric Smallwood says. For reference, back in mid-October, that figure sat at $166 million, Smallwood says.\nSwift\u2019s impact, of course, goes beyond brand value. Her fans are tuning in, paying up, and latching onto the big personalities of Travis and Jason Kelce.\nDespite not showing up until Week 3, she helped boost viewership, especially for young and female fans. The league clocked its highest regular-season female viewership since it began tracking in 2000, and the best regular season among 18-34-year-olds since 2019. From last year\u2019s regular season to this year\u2019s, male viewership increased by 6%, while female viewership rose by 9%.\nWhile Swift isn\u2019t the only reason people are tuning into Chiefs games, she\u2019s helped cement them as a top TV draw. One example: Last year\u2019s divisional win over the Jacksonville Jaguars drew an average of 34.3 million viewers. Last week\u2019s divisional win over the Buffalo Bills set an all-time record of 50.4 million average viewers.\nNaturally, women\u2019s fan apparel has seen similar returns. Kristin Juszczyk, the wife of San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who makes custom NFL apparel for celebrities, gained more than 500,000 social media followers after Swift wore her custom design to a game. Travis Kelce\u2019s jersey sales exploded, increasing by roughly 400% after Swift\u2019s first appearance. And a small business in Kansas City is feeling the love, too, after Swift ordered and wore their vintage Chiefs apparel.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had hundreds of orders over the last 48 hours,\u201d store owner Chris Harrington told Business Insider. \u201cSometimes our online store lights up after a Chiefs game when we win, but this is 100 times more than that, and we lost the game. It was the Taylor effect.\u201d\nYes, Swifties Are Becoming Football Fans\nCommissioner Roger Goodell said in 2020 that women make up 47% of the NFL\u2019s fanbase, a number that has undoubtedly increased this season. But that\u2019s not just because Swifties tune in to watch their favorite superstar get a few seconds of airtime throughout the broadcast.\nThe Kelce brothers\u2019 charisma and candidness about Swift on their New Heights podcast has provided ample lovable soundbites that translate to rooting interest.\n\u201cI decided to listen to \u2018Fearless\u2019 15 years ago and now I\u2019m crying over her boyfriend\u2019s older brother crying on a bench in a football stadium,\u201d one Swift fan posted after Jason Kelce\u2019s last game of the season, referring to the singer\u2019s sophomore album.\nUnsurprisingly, the relationship impacts Swifties and their financial decisions a lot. Swift\u2019s fans are about three times more likely to buy sports merchandise because of the \u201cLove Story,\u201d and about twice as likely to both explore sports content and tune in for games including the Super Bowl, according to a survey from Adtaxi.\nA Chiefs win on Sunday would create an extra two weeks of buzz among Swifties and 92%ers (the name for New Heights fans). A Chiefs title could change the course of human history (maybe). That\u2019s even without confirmation of Swift\u2019s attendance: she performs in Tokyo the night before the game, but FOS crunched the numbers and found she could logistically make it in time for kickoff. Call that \u201cGirl Math (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d"

      "text": "Hall Of Famer Believes Taylor Swift Connects NFL To Pop Culture\nWithout a doubt, former Texas Southern and NFL great Michael Strahan knows football. The HBCU legend spoke at the SBJ 4se conference about the Taylor Swift Effect on the National Football League and created a bit of controversy the Swifties enjoyed this week.\nThe NFL Great and Good Morning America co-host believes Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, are great for the league.\nSTRAHAN ON THE TAYLOR SWIFT EFFECT\n\"Sports have leaked into pop culture \u2014 and it's a win for everyone,\" Strahan said at Sports Business Journal's 4se conference. \"Taylor Swift is one of the best things to happen to the NFL.\"\nFor the NFL, it's simple - it's all about the ratings and selling advertisement space. Her presence boosts television ratings when Taylor Swift attends a Kansas City Chiefs game with Travis Kelce playing. Also, it has expanded the league's audience, especially among young women and non-traditional football viewers.\nNUMBERS DON'T LIE\n- Taylor Swift's first appearance at a Chiefs game (September 24, 2023, vs. the Bears) resulted in a 63% jump in female viewership aged 18-49 for that game, and overall NFL viewership for the regular season averaged 17.9 million viewers a 7% increase from the previous year \u2014 the highest since 2015.\n- Notably, football engagement among girls aged 12-17 spiked by 53% at the start of the season, directly linked to Swift's presence and the media coverage surrounding her relationship with Kelce.\nSome fans believed Strahan was off base in support of Taylor Swift's influence in calling him \"brainwashed,\" while others mentioned that he should refrain from making non-football-related comments.\nTAYLOR SWIFT ALIGNS WITH NFL PRIMETIME TV\nLike it or not, the numbers are powerful enough for the NFL to schedule seven primetime games for the 2025-25 NFL regular season \u2014 more than any team in the league, including Thanksgiving and Christmas. Remember, the Chiefs are the runners-up to the Philadelphia Eagles, who only have five primetime games. None are as prominent as the Chiefs.\nABOUT TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS\nMichael Strahan, 53, spoke about professional football players' focus on the game. \"Never mess up your primary for something secondary. I see so many guys now who are so worried about life after football before they've truly built a career in football,\" Strahan remarked.\nThe Emmy Award-winning journalist also noted that he is interested in becoming a limited partner with the New York Giants.\n\"I'd be there in whatever capacity you needed me to be,\" he said, remarking that he has no desire to \"run [the Giants'] draft.\"\nSTRAHAN'S HONORS AND ACCOLADES\n- Super Bowl champion (XLII)\n- NFL Defensive Player of the Year (2001)\n- 4\u00d7 First-team All-Pro (1997, 1998, 2001, 2003)\n- 2\u00d7 Second-team All-Pro (2002, 2005)\n- 7\u00d7 Pro Bowl (1997\u20131999, 2001\u20132003, 2005)\n- 2\u00d7 NFL sacks leader (2001, 2003)\n- NFL forced fumbles co-leader (2001)\n- NFL 2000s All-Decade Team\n- New York Giants Ring of Honor\n- New York Giants No. 92 retired\n- NFL record: 22.5 sacks in one season\n- Pro Football Hall of Fame\n- College Football Hall of Fame\n- Black College Football Hall of Fame\nThe Houston native was selected out of Texas Southern by the New York Giants as the 40th overall pick in the second round of the 1993 NFL Draft. He had an outstanding professional career as a defensive edge rusher with 854 tackles, 141.5 sacks, 24 forced fumbles, 15 fumble recoveries, four interceptions, and three defensive scores."

Then, once you\u2019ve made it through the entire six-part series, it\u2019s impossible to stave off your curiosity about other cults. What is it that makes certain people susceptible to such polarizing pedagogy? What leads a person to the \u201ccalling\u201d of a cult leader? And, most pressingly, can binge-watching documentaries about real-life cults offer any insight into the bizarre worlds inhabited by such people?\nThe lives of members of infamous cults, like the one chronicled in Wild Wild Country, make compelling fodder for limited television series and TV movies. So, you be the judge. Thanks to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, it\u2019s easier than ever to take a psychedelic trip into the belief systems of cult leaders and their followers.\nWe\u2019ve gleaned quite a few mind-blowing examples to get you started. But be forewarned, the following documentaries may leave you with more questions than answers.\n-\n\u2018Wild Wild Country\u2019\nAn oft-forgotten piece of American history, the Oregon cult formed by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in the \u201980s made it abundantly clear why separation of church and state is so important (read: poisoning people to win an election is always a bad idea). The personalities examined in this jaw-dropping docu-series are so unfathomably eccentric that you almost forget that they\u2019re real, not fictional characters.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Children of God: Lost and Found\u2019\nThis documentary won\u2019t just blow your mind \u2014 it will break your heart, too. Filmmaker and reformed Children of God cult member Noah Thompson bravely seeks out other families whose lives were fractured by sexual abuse and bondage that children endured as part of \u201cThe Family.\u201d Interesting fact: Both Rose McGowan and Joaquin Phoenix were born into this cult but escaped with relatives before any lasting damage was done.\n-\n\u2018The Source Family\u2019\nFather Yod: That\u2019s how Jim Baker was known to his followers, who subscribed to their founder\u2019s hippy-dippy, hedonistic principles. In real life, he was a restaurateur and rumored bank robber \u2014 a man who accumulated people in an attempt to validate his bizarre delusions.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Waco: The Rules of Engagement\u2019\nCould the 1993 tragedy in Waco, Texas, have been prevented? William Gazecki\u2019s Oscar-nominated 1997 documentary immerses viewers in the Branch Davidians cult formed by David Koresh, as well as the standoff that resulted in the death of federal agents and 76 members of the religious sect.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Going Clear\u2019\nConsidered the definitive Scientology documentary, Alex Gibney\u2019s examination of the religion\u2019s history and controversial founder will leave you dumbfounded. The fact that several high-profile celebrities still openly identify as Scientologists? That may be just as mysterious as the tenets discussed in Going Clear.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Heaven\u2019s Gate: The Untold Story\u2019\nArguably one of the best-known cults, Heaven\u2019s Gate was a religious sect based out of San Diego that believed in, well, aliens. Confident that a UFO would save them all from certain death and deliver them to some existential plane of existence, 39 members participated in a mass suicide. Spoiler alert: The extraterrestrials didn\u2019t show.\n-\n\u2018Holy Hell\u2019\nWatch Will Allen\u2019s documentary about the Buddhafield movement, and you\u2019ll walk away with a serious case of the heebie-jeebies.

The saying comes from the story of polygamist fundamentalist Jim Jones and his People\u2019s Temple.
