  "description": "\u201cI\u2019m simply sorry to the New York taxpayers,\u201d said Erden Arkan, 76, the owner of KSK Construction Group in Williamsburg, before the lax sentence was handed down in Manhattan feder\u2026",
  "content": "A Brooklyn construction kingpin apologized to New York taxpayers Friday as he was handed a wrist-slap sentence for funneling illegal donations to Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 2021 campaign.\n\nErden Arkan, 76, the owner of KSK Construction Group in Williamsburg, had faced up to six months behind bars under federal sentencing guidelines, but prosecutors and a probation officer agreed no prison time was warranted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m simply sorry to the New York taxpayers,\u201d said a rueful Arkan before he was sentenced to one year of probation in Manhattan federal court.\n\nThe Turkey native pleaded guilty in January to a wire fraud charge for illegally reimbursing his employees for roughly $18,000 of donations they made toward Adams\u2019 successful 2021 campaign for mayor.\n\nThe Adams campaign then used those funds to fraudulently hoover up public dollars under a city program that matches donations 8-to-1 with taxpayer cash, prosecutors alleged.\n\nThe feds said Adams had personally asked the wealthy magnate and a Turkish diplomat for campaign cash at an April 2021 dinner.\n\nArkan tried to convince other members of the city\u2019s Turkish community to bundle donations to Adams at a fundraiser he held soon after the meeting at his business\u2019s headquarters, court papers said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this is how things work in this country,\u201d he allegedly wrote to his colleagues.\n\nAdams was charged in September 2024 with taking $123,000 in travel perk bribes and ripping off taxpayers with bogus campaign cash from Turks in exchange for help fast-tracking the opening of the Manhattan Turkish consulate building.\n\nBut the Justice Department under President Trump took the unusual move in February of pushing for the historic corruption case against Hizzoner to be dismissed, without commenting on the strength of the prosecution.\n\nThe judge overseeing both Adams and Arkan\u2019s cases, Dale Ho, has suggested that the DOJ moved to toss the charges in exchange for the mayor\u2019s help rolling out the White House\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nAdams pleaded not guilty and has also denied allegations that there was a crooked \u201cquid pro quo\u201d tied to the case dismissal.\n\nArkan\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Rosen, accused the government on Friday of being \u201cunfair\u201d and inconsistent in continuing to prosecute his client after Ho agreed to toss Adams\u2019 case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m commenting on the incoherence,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nBut a visibly irked Ho shot back, \u201cWhat impact does that have on the decision before me today?\u201d\n\nThe judge added that Arkan \u2014 who said his company netted more than $1 billion in revenue since its founding in 2003 \u2014 had otherwise lived an \u201cexemplary\u201d life before his arrest, before wishing him good luck in the future.\n\n\u201cI promise to do good. This will never happen again,\u201d Arkan told the court.\n\nOn top of the one year of probation, Arkan was ordered to pay $18,000 in restitution and a $9,500 fine.\n\nA rep for Adams\u2019 2025 campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "Trump\u2019s DOJ to toss NYC Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 historic bribery case, agrees with Dem that charges were politically motivated by Biden admin\nThe Justice Department ordered Manhattan prosecutors Monday to dismiss the historic bribery case against Mayor Eric Adams \u2014 siding with Hizzoner that the charges under the Biden administration were politically motivated and hampered his ability to combat the migrant crisis in New York City, The Post has confirmed.\nThe new DOJ under President Trump instructed the Southern District of New York to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning charges could be refiled in the future, sources said.\n\u201cYou are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges\u201d against Adams, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote in a letter obtained by The Post.\nThe letter notes \u201cindependent reasons\u201d as to why Adams\u2019 case was being tossed \u2014 including that the case was retribution for him speaking out against the Biden administration for its handling of the migrant crisis.\n\u201cIt cannot be ignored that Mayor Adams criticized the prior Administration\u2019s immigration policies before the charges were filed, and the former US Attorney\u2019s public actions created appearances of impropriety\u2026\u201d\nBove wrote that the charges have \u201cimproperly interfered with Mayor Adams\u2019 campaign in the 2025 mayoral election\u201d and also have \u201cunduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that escalated under the policies of the prior Administration.\u201d\nThe immigration crackdown is a focus for Trump out of the gate in his second term, and Adams has signaled a willingness to support harsh measures \u2014 including rolling back sanctuary city policies \u2014 that are anathema to many of his Democratic counterparts.\nBut Adams isn\u2019t entirely in the clear, as Bove\u2019s letter also notes that \u201cthe matter shall be reviewed by the confirmed US Attorney in the Southern District of New York, following the November 2025 mayoral election.\u201d\n\u201cThere shall be no further targeting of Mayor Adams or additional investigative steps \u2026 and you are further directed to take all steps within your power to cause Mayor Adams\u2019 security clearances to be restored,\u201d he wrote.\nA motion outlining the legal reasons behind the dismissal is expected to be filed as soon as Tuesday.\nA rep for the SDNY declined to comment.\nAdams on Monday night offered a measured reaction to the news, telling a Fox News reporter while out to dinner with supermarket mogul John Catsimatidis that he had little information.\n\u201cWe were just notified of the possibility that the DOJ has communicated with the local US Attorney\u2019s Office here,\u201d he said, according to video posted on X. \u201cI would like to speak to [my lawyer] first and get a better understanding of exactly what\u2019s taking place now because right now I don\u2019t have any information.\u201d\nThe stunning turn of events appears to signal the end of the years-long criminal probe into Adams\u2019 2021 mayoral campaign that has hung over Hizzoner\u2019s head during his scandal-plagued first term in office.\nAdams, 64, who was indicted in September, was accused of accepting thousands of dollars in free or upgraded luxury travel as bribes from foreign nationals in exchange for political favors, including helping fast-track the opening of the Turkish Consulate in Manhattan.\nThe Democratic mayor quickly denied the accusations and cast the prosecution as political retribution from the former Biden administration for speaking out on the migrant crisis.\nAs migrants flowed largely unimpeded across the US-Mexico border and reached New York City by the thousands, Adams bucked Biden as he begged for funding and a national decompression strategy.\nBut the calls went unheeded and put Adams, who once called himself the \u201cBiden of Brooklyn,\u201d forever out of the former president\u2019s good graces.\nShortly after a stunning, 57-page indictment dropped, Adams vowed to fight.\n\u201cDespite our pleas, when the federal government did nothing as its broken immigration policies overloaded our shelter system with no relief, I put the people of New York before party and politics,\u201d he said at the time.\n\u201cI always knew that if I stood my ground for New Yorkers that I would be a target \u2014 and a target I became.\u201d\nThe claim of political persecution was ready-made to find a receptive audience with Trump, who made similar assertions about his myriad criminal cases.\nTrump contended after Adams\u2019 indictment that he predicted the mayor would face federal charges for implicitly speaking out against Biden.\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018You know what? He\u2019ll be indicted within a year,\u2019\u201d Trump said.\nAdams\u2019 defense team long expected a Trump administration to be more amenable to its case, either through a presidential pardon or a dismissal motion from the highest levels of the DOJ \u2014 despite the case starting under Trump\u2019s first term in 2021.\nAnd the dismissal order comes after weeks of Adams trying to get in Trump\u2019s good graces by going out of his way to not criticize the president and to publicly align himself with new immigration policies.\nAdams also hurried down to Trump\u2019s inauguration on a middle-of-the-night invite hours before the ceremony and flew to have lunch with the then-president-elect at one of his golf clubs near Mar-a-Lago.\nIn addition, his celebrity attorney Alex Spiro had been working through legal back channels to find some way out of the case with either a pardon or dismissal.\nOn Jan. 31, the mayor\u2019s defense team met with some of the highest members of the DOJ in Washington, DC.\n\u201cAs I said from the outset, the mayor is innocent \u2014 and he would prevail. Today he has,\u201d Spiro said in a statement.\n\u201cThe facts of the case are clear: The mayor never used his official position for personal benefit. Nor did he have any role in violating campaign finance laws. Despite a lot of fanfare and sensational claims, ultimately there was no evidence presented that he broke any laws, ever. The witnesses that were promised never materialized. The additional charges that were threatened never came. Now, thankfully, the mayor and New York can put this unfortunate and misguided prosecution behind them.\u201d\nIn a footnote, Bove\u2019s letter contended there wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo between Adams and the Trump administration.\n\u201c(The) Government is not offering to exchange dismissal of a criminal case for Adams\u2019s assistance on immigration enforcement,\u201d it states.\nUnencumbered by the looming potential prison time, Adams can now pivot to what still is expected to be a bruising primary, with a slate of Dems looking to dethrone a seemingly vulnerable incumbent mayor.\nThe bribery case, though, was just one of the issues that dragged down Adams\u2019 poll numbers to record lows \u2014 including crime, the migrant crisis and a cast of cronies brought into the admin by the mayor who have also found themselves in similar legal troubles.\nNews of the investigation burst onto the scene in November 2023 when Adams\u2019 top fundraiser, Brianna Suggs, was raided by the feds, forcing the mayor to abruptly return from Washington, DC, just moments after landing.\nAgents also raided Brooklyn-based KSK Construction and the homes of Rana Abbsova, a longtime Adams staffer, and Cenk \u00d6cal, a former Turkish Airlines executive and member of the mayoral transition team.\nDays later, the feds stopped Adams on the street and ordered him to hand over all his electronic devices, including a phone that he \u201cforgot\u201d the password for and feds have been unable to access.\nOn Sept. 26, then-US Attorney Damian Williams\u2019 Southern District of New York office unveiled the indictment against the mayor.\nFor months, the mayor\u2019s high-profile attorney Spiro has tried to convince the Biden DOJ and the judge hearing the case to dismiss it \u2014 to no avail.\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, Williams resigned from his post and argued in a City & State op-ed that the city was \u201cbeing led with a broken ethical compass\u201d \u2014 a remark that Spiro seized upon and argued showed that the former prosecutor went after Adams to further his political career.\nThe argument featured in the dismissal letter, which contended they \u201ccreated appearances of impropriety.\u201d\nJudge Dale Ho, who has heard the case in Manhattan federal court, will still have to sign off on the dismissal, but that appears to be just a formality, with prosecutors saying they have no intention of continuing the case.\nThe dismissal could also threaten the Southern District\u2019s reputation for independence from the political winds blowing in Washington, DC \u2014 a distinction that has earned it the nickname the \u201cSovereign District.\u201d\nActing Manhattan US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, a veteran prosecutor who helped convict scruffy crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, had shot down Adams\u2019 claims that he was indicted for \u201cany reason other than his crimes.\u201d\n\u201cThat claim disintegrated when discovery made clear that the investigation into Adams began more than a year earlier, based on concrete evidence that Adams had accepted illegal campaign contributions,\u201d she wrote in a recent filing hinting at further charges against the mayor.\nSassoon, however, is likely to soon be replaced by Trump\u2019s pick Jay Clayton, a former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission."

      "text": "Prosecutors were prepping to charge Eric Adams with destroying evidence, Manhattan US attorney\u2019s resignation letter reveals\nManhattan federal prosecutors were prepared to bring a new bombshell indictment charging Mayor Eric Adams with destroying evidence and telling people to lie to the FBI, a letter obtained by The Post reveals.\nThe letter sent by Danielle Sassoon, who resigned from her post Thursday rather than obey an order from President Trump\u2019s Justice Department to kill the case, also blasts the \u201crushed and superficial\u201d reasoning that she says was behind Washington DC\u2019s demand.\n\u201cBecause the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations,\u201d wrote Sassoon, a Republican.\nThe former clerk for conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia also explicitly accused Adams of offering to help Trump\u2019s immigration agenda in exchange for the case being dropped.\n\u201cRather than be rewarded, Adams\u2019s advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case,\u201d she wrote.\nThe Manhattan feds\u2019 proposed new expanded indictment \u201cwould add an obstruction conspiracy count based on evidence that Adams destroyed and instructed others to destroy evidence and provide false information to the FBI,\u201d reads the stunning letter, sent by Sassoon Wednesday to US Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nThe new charges would also expand on allegations that Adams asked for illegal donations from Turkish nationals as part of a \u201cfraudulent straw donor scheme,\u201d the letter reveals.\nSassoon says in the letter that she could no longer \u201ccredibly represent the government before the courts\u201d if she caved to Justice Department officials\u2019 demand for her to move to drop Adams\u2019 case.\nActing US Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, formerly one of Trump\u2019s criminal attorneys in his hush money case, fired back with his own letter Thursday accepting Sassoon\u2019s resignation \u2014 and accusing her of pressing on with a \u201cpolitically motivated prosecution\u201d in spite of main Justice\u2019s orders.\nThe Manhattan federal prosecutors\u2019 office has a centuries-old reputation for independence from officials in Washington, DC. It\u2019s often referred to as the \u201cSovereign District.\u201d\nBut those days of independence are over, declared Bove, himself a former alum of the office\u2019s terrorism division.\n\u201cNo US Attorney\u2019s Office is a separate sovereign,\u201d Bove told The Post in a statement. \u201cI concluded earlier this week that the prosecution of Mayor Adams must be dismissed in order to prioritize national security and public safety over continuing with a case that has been tainted from the start by troubling tactics,\u201d Bove added.\n\u201cThere is no room at the Justice Department for attorneys who refuse to execute on the priorities of the Executive Branch \u2014 priorities determined by the American people. I look forward to working with new leadership at SDNY on the important priorities President Trump has laid out for us to make America safe again.\u201d\nAdams, 64, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he took $123,000 worth of travel-perk bribes from Turks in exchange for fast-tracking the opening of the Turkish Consulate in Manhattan. He is also charged with soliciting illegal donations from Turks who poured tens of thousands in illegal funds into his 2021 mayoral campaign."

      "text": "Dramatic video shows feds re-arresting Subway sandwich slinger after he pelted officer with hero in DC\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department worker accused of throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent was re-arrested by an armed team of at least a half-dozen US Marshals in a dramatic Wednesday night raid, new video shows.\nSean Charles Dunn, 37, was cuffed a second time inside his apartment about a mile northwest of the White House \u2014 after being slapped with a felony assault charge.\nFootage of the raid was posted by the White House on X Thursday evening with the caption: \u201cNighttime Routine: Operation Make D.C. Safe Again Edition.\u201d\nIn a stunning twist, Attorney General Pam Bondi had revealed hours earlier that Dunn was a DOJ Criminal Division employee.\nIn the same statement, Bondi announced Dunn was fired from his post as an international affairs specialist working to help extradite criminal suspects to and from the US.\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d the AG said. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\n\u201cHe thought it was funny,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Wednesday in announcing the federal case. Well he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer \u2026 So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nDunn made an initial court appearance Thursday and was released on his own recognizance. A preliminary hearing was set for Sept. 4.\nThe suspect initially was arrested Sunday night after allegedly berating a group of Customs and Border Protection officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before pelting one with his late-night snack \u2014 in what observers said appeared to be an alcohol-fueled rage.\nTrump announced a surge of federal officials to help DC police fight violent crime Aug. 7 and escalated the effort Monday by asserting federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department and mobilizing the National Guard.\nDunn wielded his deli weapon at the intersection of DC\u2019s 14th and U Streets \u2014 across from a McDonald\u2019s where a 16-year-old girl was stabbed to death in 2023 in a dispute over sweet and sour sauce.\nJust a couple blocks north of the site, a crowd of hecklers appeared to prompt federal agents to discontinue a vehicle checkpoint on Wednesday night."

He did not want a digital forensic trail available at all,\u201d she told the Mail.\nThe Cellebrite team also discovered a PDF file about another serial killer and rapist, Danny Rolling \u2014 also known as the \u201cGainesville Ripper\u201d \u2014 whose horrific murders targeting University of Florida students decades ago is eerily similar to Kohberger\u2019s heinous crimes.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Newly released crime scene photos show inside Idaho house where Bryan Kohberger killed four college students\n- Cops investigated Kohberger for eerily similar break-in a year before University of Idaho killings\n- Secret documents in Bryan Kohberger case, including pics of Idaho murder victims, could be made public\n- Newly released photo shows Bryan Kohberger just moments after arrest for Idaho murders\n- Bryan Kohberger may have used second weapon and left \u2018scared\u2019 while sparing surviving roommate: report\nRolling, who was the inspiration for the slasher classic \u201cScream,\u201d murdered five UF students \u2014 four women and one man \u2014 after breaking into their homes during a four-day spree in 1990.\nHe raped all his female victims, and killed two of them with a Ka-Bar knife \u2014 the same weapon Kohberger used, prosecutors said. Rolling was executed in 2006.\nKohberger\u2019s cell phone additionally contained creepy selfies of the killer posing shirtless and flexing his muscles, the experts said.\nHe also snapped the chilling selfie of himself giving the thumbs-up just hours after he murdered the four University of Idaho students.\nHeather, Senior Director of Forensic Research at Cellebrite, and Jared Barnhart, Head of CX Strategy and Advocacy at the company, were prepared to testify as expert witnesses at Kohberger\u2019s trial before he pleaded guilty last month.\nKohberger was sentenced to four life sentences for killing roommates Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin."

He agreed to pay $18,000 in restitution.\nHis lawyer, Jonathan Rosen, declined to comment on his way out of court.\nAdams\u2019 defense team was unfazed by the deal, saying the government hasn\u2019t turned over any evidence in discovery connected to Arkan that would incriminate the mayor\nThe deal comes just days after the feds signaled more charges could be coming down the pike soon \u2014 telling the judge they had unearthed \u201cadditional criminal conduct\u201d by Adams and his associates.\nKSK Construction in Williamsburg was one of the locations raided by the feds in November 2023 when news of the Southern District of New York\u2019s probe first began public."

  "argos_summary": "Brooklyn construction magnate Erden Arkan pleaded guilty to funneling illegal donations to Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 2021 campaign and received a one\u2011year probation sentence, restitution, and a fine, after prosecutors and a probation officer agreed no prison time was warranted. Arkan\u2019s scheme involved reimbursing employees for donations that were used to obtain public matching funds, a practice tied to a broader federal investigation that also targeted Adams for alleged bribes and campaign finance violations. The DOJ, under the Trump administration, dismissed the historic bribery case against Adams, citing political motivations, but prosecutors remain poised to pursue additional charges. The case underscores the intersection of campaign finance fraud, political influence, and federal prosecutorial discretion in New York City politics.",
