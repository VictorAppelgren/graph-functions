      "feedback": "Your draft captures the headline drivers but lacks the causal depth, specificity, and source‑anchored quantification required for a world‑class view; tighten the chain by linking the real‑rate differential to capital‑flow mechanics (cite PA57YBYVQ for Japan bank outflows), then to U.S. credit tightening and equity compression (cite OGK8WLL69 for yield expectations); replace the generic “AI‑chip demand sustaining high valuation” with the concrete 25‑bp Fed hike scenario that raises the real‑rate differential and compresses the S&P 500 by ~2 % (cite T7HLAX8QN and MSPXAOHU8 for Nvidia revenue guidance); for the “Ad‑tier uptake” line, quantify the expected P/E shrinkage to 45 by Q2 2026 if ad‑tier revenue grows 20 % (cite 61SVFUKBY for the 10–15 % price bump); for the “EV transition losses” entry, specify that Ford’s Q2 EV loss of ~$1.3 B and 4.3 % EBIT (cite W2622L6WW) would push ROIC below 8 % and depress the S&P 500 by ~1 % (cite 22PL3Q360 for EV CAGR); adjust probabilities to reflect the relative weight of each catalyst (e.g., 80 % for the Fed‑rate‑hike scenario, 60 % for the Nvidia revenue miss, 50 % for the EV loss, 55 % for the real‑rate differential widening); ensure each line cites only the IDs that support the specific fact or number; remove any generic “watch” signals that are already implied by the trigger; and keep each line to one sentence, no filler.",
