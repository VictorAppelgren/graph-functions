  "title": "Sony Insists It's Still Committed To Xperia Phones",
  "description": "Despite clear evidence to the contrary.",
  "content": "You'd be excused for not knowing Sony still makes phones. For what it's worth, they're actually pretty good, but they're not as popular as they used to be. Despite what has certainly looked like a clear scaleback, Sony is still not giving up on Xperia, at least publicly.\n\nSony Group's Chief Financial Officer, Sue Lin, has tried to publicly deny speculation that Sony was giving up on the Xperia line. Speaking at a corporate financial results briefing on August 7th, Lin stated that Xperia \"is a very important business for us.\" The statement came as a direct response to concerns following all the technical issues the latest model, the Xperia 1 VII, has been suffering. In case you haven't seen, buyers have been reporting a variety of issues, including random reboots and shutdowns, frequent overheating, battery drain, and charging problems, which have even caused Sony to stop selling the device while it fixes the issues. It was also recently reported that Sony outsourced the production of this phone, which is made by a third party rather than Sony itself.\n\nIt should also be noted that Xperia isn't the household name it once used to be. Xperia phones are not sold in the US anymore, and even in Sony's home market of Japan, it's not the hottest thing anymore\u2014Apple holds the most market share in Japan, and while Sony still holds some market share, it is behind other Android OEMs such as Google, Xiaomi, and Samsung.\n\nDespite all these problems, which certainly sound like things that happen to a smartphone line that its maker doesn't care about anymore, Sony is at the very least not publicly admitting it. \"Communication technology is a very important technology that Sony has cultivated for a long time,\" Lin explained. \"We also want to continue to value our smartphone business.\" Lin emphasized that the expertise and patents developed within Sony's mobile division have critical applications in products beyond not just smartphones, making it a vital hub for innovation across the entire Sony Group.\n\nSony phones have a small, albeit enthusiastic, community of users who value the fact that Sony cares about things like headphone jacks, microSD slots, and more niche features like an odd 21:9 aspect ratio display and professional-grade camera controls. It won't be able to stay afloat just from this, though, but I guess this news does mean that we'll see an Xperia 1 VIII next year. After that, though, the Xperia line could (and probably will) go the way of LG phones\u2014killed off due to a last-minute business decision because it's not really profitable to keep it going.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Sony's Xperia 1 VII boasts 48MP ultrawide camera, high-end audio, and a Snapdragon CPU.\n- Features include microSD card slot, headphone jack, and IP65/68 rating.\n- Availability in UK and Europe, with a price tag of approximately $1,700 making it a bit of a tough sell.\nmicroSD card slots on Android phones, especially higher-end ones, have gone from being a standard feature to a rare commodity only some phones have. If you long for the days where microSD cards and expandable storage in general were commonplace, and you want a higher-end phone that fits that description, Sony's latest Xperia 1 VII might fit the bill.\nSony has just announced its latest flagship smartphone, the Xperia 1 VII. It looks and feels a lot like Sony's previous flagship smartphones, which is not entirely surprising\u2014Sony phones have a very specific small but enthusiastic crowd. In terms of camera hardware, which tends to be one of Sony's fortes, the most significant camera upgrade is a new 48-megapixel ultrawide sensor. Sony states this sensor is twice as large as the one found in its predecessor, the Xperia 1 VI. The main and variable telephoto lenses from the previous model remain unchanged in the Xperia 1 VII, but the company did try to spice things up with a few new software features. We have an AI-powered auto-framing mode borrowed from Sony's Alpha camera line, which is designed to recognize human subjects and automatically crop video footage to keep them centered within the frame.\nSony has incorporated high-end audio components directly from its modern Walkman audio players. This includes the use of higher-quality solder in the headphone jack which, if you're an audiophile, means output from the headphone jack should be as clean as it gets. The Xperia 1 VII supports AI-based DSEE Ultimate upscaling technology, alongside Hi-Res Audio, LDAC, and Dolby Atmos formats. The phone's stereo speakers also apparently offer improved bass.\nUnder the hood, the Xperia 1 VII is powered by the flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. Despite the newer specs, though, this phone is cool because it keeps a lot of \"older\" features that have been neglected for years by the bigger smartphone manufacturer. As you've noticed in the last paragraph, we have a headphone jack, and a particularly high-quality one at that. We also get a microSD card slot, which allows you to expand your phone's storage by up to 2TB. The device features an IP65/68 rating for dust and water resistance, supports wireless charging, and is equipped with a 5,000mAh battery.\nThe only thing you might not like about this phone is the price. Sony has not announced plans for a US release of the Xperia 1 VII just yet, but the phone is available starting today in the UK and Europe. And it's priced at a whopping \u00a31,399 in the UK and \u20ac1,499 in Europe, which translates to approximately $1,700 USD. At that price it's right there pricing-wise with foldable phones, which makes it a hard purchase. Keep an eye out at your retailer of choice if you want one.\nSource: The Verge"
