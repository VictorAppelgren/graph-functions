Meanwhile, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has released its R1 reasoning model, claiming performance comparable to OpenAI’s ChatGPT‑o1 while operating at a fraction of the cost, despite U.S. export controls on advanced chips. The article highlights how both sustainability in construction and AI innovation are reshaping industry standards and addressing climate and technological challenges.",
