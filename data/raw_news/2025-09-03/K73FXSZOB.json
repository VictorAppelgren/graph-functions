  "content": "THIS is the bizarre moment Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un were caught on a hot mic discussing IMMORTALITY.\n\nThe bloodcurdling moment was caught on a livestream as three men walked together with a gang of other world leaders.\n\nVlad, Xi and Kim were leading the group as they went to go watch China's biggest ever military parade.\n\nThe broadcast featured the three despots discussing how biotechnology could result in humans living up to 150.\n\nPutin even then speculates that repeated organ transplants could let us \"perhaps even achieve immortality\".\n\nAll three - who had never met before - are known for their strict, highly choreographed appearences in front of the cameras.\n\nAnd catching them in an unguarded moment talking amongst themselves is unprecdented.\n\nThe live video, mainly covered by voice-over in English, was relayed via international wire services .\n\nThe rest of their conversation was not broadcast to the world.\n\nXi, 72, says to Putin in exchange: \"Earlier, people rarely lived to 70, but these days at 70 years you are still a child.\"\n\nPutin, 72, then replies: \"With the development of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, and you people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality.\"\n\nXi adds: Predications are, this century, there's a chance of also living to 150.\"\n\nThe feed then cuts away and the rest of exchange is not caught on the hot mic.\n\nKim, 41, does not speak during the exchange - but can be seen listening intently.",
