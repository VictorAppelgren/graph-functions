  "description": "On her 2022 tour of The Bahamas with Prince William, Kate wore a pair of sage green chino shorts that made a lasting impression.",
  "content": "Daily Mail journalists select and curate the products that feature on our site. If you make a purchase via links on this page we will earn commission - learn more\n\nWith summer in full swing, a versatile pair of shorts is the ultimate wardrobe essential - polished enough for city wear, yet effortless for weekends away.\n\nAnd when it comes to timeless style, who better to take cues from than the Princess of Wales? On her 2022 tour of The Bahamas with Prince William, Kate wore a pair of sage green chino shorts that made a lasting impression.\n\nPerfectly tailored with a mid-rise waist and clean lines, they struck the ideal balance between polished and effortless.\n\nThe best thing about this look is its staying power. It's the kind of piece you can wear year after year, and I wouldn't be surprised if Kate still packs them for her summer holidays.\n\nIt's no wonder smart shorts are having a moment on the high street.\n\nBoden's Dulwich Linen Shorts are a standout. Available in seven colourways, the black pair is especially versatile, with a flattering high waist and pleat detailing. They transition easily from office wear to off-duty exploring, and they're currently reduced from \u00a379 to \u00a355.30.\n\nFor a softer pop of colour, Karen Millen's City Shorts in cornflower blue offer a seamless blend of structure and comfort. Crafted from a lightweight woven fabric, they look smart while staying breathable, and they're now just \u00a335 (down from \u00a369). A khaki version is also available.\n\nPhase Eight's Lottie Linen-blend Shorts are designed to resist creasing, making them an instant winner. The vibrant papaya orange hue is right on, while the longer length provides a little extra coverage for those who prefer it.\n\nOf course, there are plenty more chic options from the likes of Mango, Reiss and Mint Velvet, catering to all tastes. Scroll on to see the best of the rest...",

Instead, we\u2019ve proportionally shortened the length throughout on these garments \u2013 not just at the knee or ankle \u2013 so that they fit and flatter all over. You\u2019ll notice the difference when you try them on.\nIn jumpsuits we also offer a \u2018tall\u2019 size for customers 5ft 10in or over. We\u2019ve not just added extra fabric to the legs but increased the length proportionately throughout the style to ensure a noticeably improved, flattering fit.\nFor our \u2018long\u2019 styles, we\u2019ve added extra length at the bottom, so you can choose where you\u2019d like the hemline to fall and whether you\u2019d like to wear the garment with flats or (hooray) heels.\nFit\nSize\nLow stock - Act fast as there are only a few left\nFREE DELIVERY\non orders over \u00a350\nFREE RETURNS\nwithin 90 days\nDelivery & returns info\nDelivery & returns info\nDelivery\nUK Standard\n2-3 working days\n\u00a33.95\nExpress\nNext working day if ordered Monday to Friday by 7pm (excluding bank holidays)* - \u00a37.95\nClick & Collect\nNext working day\nIf ordered Sunday to Friday by 7pm (excluding Bank Holidays) - \u00a33.50\nView more delivery information\nReturns\nFree returns within the UK\nReturn within 90 days or 14 days for sale items\nWe offer a 365-day quality guarantee\n- Gentle machine wash\n- Functional pockets \u2013 are tacked closed to help the garment hold its shape, tacking is designed to be removed\n- Inside leg available in 4\"/10cm and 6\"/15cm\n- Sits at natural waist\n- Slim through waist, hip and hem\n- Designed to fall on the thigh\n- 1/2 elasticated back waist\n- Button fastening at centre front waist with zipped fly\nR0721-BLK"
