  "description": "The Daily Beast faced backlash for publishing an article criticizing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over executions of convicted murderers and rapists who happened to also be veterans.",
  "content": "The Daily Beast faced widespread backlash on Wednesday after publishing an \"absolutely bonkers\" report claiming Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is facing criticism for letting the state carry out executions of death row inmates who also happened to be military veterans \u2014 including individuals convicted of murder and rape, which the piece largely failed to mention.The article, \"Veterans Beg Ron DeSantis to Stop Killing Them,\" insisted the Florida governor is \"under fire for turning against his fellow service members and letting executioners slaughter five veterans this year alone.\" It suggested DeSantis is backtracking on a previous claim that Florida is \"the most veteran-friendly state\" in the nation because extremely violent criminals aren\u2019t spared the death penalty. \"Veterans statewide are now pleading with DeSantis to stop the executions of fellow former service members, all of whom devoted part of their life to protecting the country,\" Kenneal Patterson, who is described as an intern on the liberal website, wrote in the story. The article had the word \"backstabber\" plastered in all caps and red font beneath the headline. TRUMP SIGNS NEW LAW HELPING VETERANS AVOID FORECLOSURE WITH PARTIAL CLAIMS PAYMENT PROGRAMThe story noted that DeSantis served in the U.S. Navy himself, and that more than 130 fellow veterans penned a letter asking him to \"stop setting the executions of our fellow soldiers.\" The Daily Beast report named several veterans who have either been executed or are awaiting execution, failing to inform readers of the crimes that the majority of them were found guilty of. The only veteran whose crime was noted in the article was Jeffrey Hutchinson, who \"was executed in May for the murders of his girlfriend and her three children.\" DESANTIS PICKS \u2018THE CHUCK NORRIS OF FLORIDA POLITICS\u2019 AS NEW TOP DEPUTYWhen shared on X, the Daily Beast report was slapped with a Community Note: \"The @thedailybeast defends Bobby Joe Long, executed in 2019, but omits why: Long was a serial killer who raped and murdered at least 10 women in Tampa Bay in 1984. He confessed and was convicted of eight homicides, plus additional rapes and abductions.\" Two other veterans named in the article were convicted of rape and murder, including a man who killed an 8-year-old girl and her grandmother, but the report didn\u2019t mention why they landed on death row. DeSantis\u2019 Communications Director Alex Lanfranconi provided a comment to the Daily Beast. \"A simple trick to avoid execution in Florida is to not murder people,\" Lanfranconi said.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis is under fire for turning against his fellow service members and letting executioners slaughter five veterans this year alone.\nThe governor, who served in the U.S. Navy as a commissioned officer from 2004 to 2010, has called Florida \u201cthe most veteran-friendly state\u201d in the nation. But during his reign, nine people have been executed\u2014including five veterans.\nFlorida administers executions by lethal injection or electric chair at the execution chamber located at Florida State Prison.\nVeterans statewide are now pleading with DeSantis to stop the executions of fellow former service members, all of whom devoted part of their life to protecting the country.\n\u201cWe can never be a veteran friendly state when our leader is signing off on their deaths at the hands of the State,\u201d more than 130 vets wrote in a letter to DeSantis. \u201cWe urge you now to lead from a place of bravery, to return to the honor code from your service, and to stop setting the executions of our fellow soldiers.\u201d\nNearly 30 veterans are sitting on death row, waiting for execution, including 67-year-old Kayle Bates who is set to be killed on Aug. 19. The letter implores DeSantis to prevent Bates\u2019 death.\n\u201cWe write to you today as fellow veterans. We write to you to highlight a disturbing trend, and one that only you have the power to correct,\u201d the letter begins.\nDuring DeSantis\u2019 term, five veterans have been executed: Bobby Joe Long, Duane Owen, Edward James, Jeffrey Hutchinson, and Edward Zakrzewski. Bates is set to become the tenth on Aug. 19, followed by Curtis Windom on Aug. 28.\nDeSantis served in the Navy after graduating from Yale University and Harvard Law School. He worked his way up to lieutenant during his time in the Navy and served at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq. He was honorably discharged from active duty in 2010.\n\u201cThe military instills in all of us an unbreakable code of honor: leave no one behind. That obligation does not end at the end of one\u2019s duty,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cTo a great degree that is where it begins for our mentally injured soldiers, Marines, sailors, and airmen.\u201d\nIt continues: \u201cTo execute a veteran who was broken by war and left without adequate care is not justice. It is a failure of duty. It is the final abandonment.\u201d\nHutchinson, a 62-year-old veteran with severe mental problems, was executed in May for the murders of his girlfriend and her three children. His lawyer said during his trial that he suffered from serious health problems from the war in Iraq, post-traumatic stress disorder, and paranoia. He long claimed that he was innocent and pointed to conspiracy theories to explain the murders.\nSince the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, Florida has carried out more executions this year than any other state and most under any governor.\nWhen reached for comment, DeSantis\u2019 Communications Director Alex Lanfranconi told the Daily Beast after publication: \u201cA simple trick to avoid execution in Florida is to not murder people.\u201d"

      "text": "Ron DeSantis is a Republican politician who currently serves as the 46th governor of Florida. From 2013 to 2018, DeSantis previously served in the House of Representatives for Florida's 6th district. He is widely seen as a major conservative political leader and a possible 2024 Republican presidential contender.\nBefore entering politics, DeSantis was a Navy lieutenant, an advisor for SEAL Team One, and was later deployed to Iraq. In 2008, he was appointed to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida to serve as a Special Assistant attorney until 2010. DeSantis received his undergraduate degree at Yale and graduated from Harvard Law School.\nDuring his tenure in Congress, DeSantis gained a reputation as an ardent defender of President Donald Trump by opposing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In 2018, he won the Florida gubernatorial campaign against Democratic Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum by a thin margin, triggering a recount. DeSantis would go on to win the governorship by a 0.4% margin.\nDeSantis's stardom in conservative politics took off partly due to the coronavirus and vaccination policies he implemented in Florida during the pandemic. He prohibited private businesses from enforcing face masks and vaccination requirements. He received praise from conservatives such as Trump but was criticized by those on the left, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. In October 2021, Florida\nrecorded the lowest COVID-19 daily average case per 100,000 residents in the United States, according to the state government.\nDeSantis also signed a law prohibiting educational instructors from teaching students about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to the third grade. Critics of the bill have referred to it as the \"Don't Say, Gay Bill.\" After the bill's passage, Disney admonished the Florida government and vowed to help fight the law in court. As a result, DeSantis stripped \"Walt Disney World\" of its self-governing status in the state. During the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election on November 8th, 2022, Desantis was reelected by nearly 60% of the electorate."
