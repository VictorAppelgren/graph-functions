  "description": "As a\u00e7\u00f5es da Nvidia ca\u00edram na quarta-feira, \u00e0 medida que o destino de seus neg\u00f3cios na China ficava incerto, envolvido na guerra comercial entre Washington e Pequim.",
  "content": "27 Ago (Reuters) - As a\u00e7\u00f5es da Nvidia (NVDA.O) ca\u00edram na quarta-feira, \u00e0 medida que o destino de seus neg\u00f3cios na China ficava incerto, envolvido na guerra comercial entre Washington e Pequim.\n\nO presidente-executivo Jensen Huang espera obter permiss\u00e3o para reiniciar a venda de chips da Nvidia para a China, depois de fechar um acordo com o presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, para pagar comiss\u00f5es ao governo dos EUA. No entanto, sem regras formais em vigor nos EUA e com d\u00favidas sobre se os reguladores chineses ir\u00e3o desencorajar a compra de chips da Nvidia, a empresa l\u00edder no mercado de intelig\u00eancia artificial excluiu as vendas potenciais para a China da previs\u00e3o para o trimestre atual.\n\nCom isso, restou apenas uma perspectiva pouco animadora que, embora ainda seja enorme em termos absolutos em d\u00f3lares e ligeiramente acima das estimativas dos analistas, decepcionou os investidores acostumados a resultados expressivos e fez com que as a\u00e7\u00f5es ca\u00edssem 3,2% nas negocia\u00e7\u00f5es ap\u00f3s o fechamento do preg\u00e3o. A queda das a\u00e7\u00f5es cortou cerca de US$110 bilh\u00f5es da capitaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de mercado de US$4,4 trilh\u00f5es da Nvidia.\n\n\"O maior gargalo da Nvidia n\u00e3o \u00e9 o sil\u00edcio, \u00e9 a diplomacia\", disse Michael Ashley Schulman, diretor de investimentos da Running Point Capital.\n\nA fabricante de chips espera uma receita de US$54 bilh\u00f5es, mais ou menos 2%, no terceiro trimestre, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com a estimativa m\u00e9dia dos analistas de US$53,14 bilh\u00f5es, de acordo com dados compilados pela LSEG.\n\nA Nvidia tamb\u00e9m disse que n\u00e3o incluiu nenhuma remessa de chips H20 para a China em suas estimativas, apesar de ter recebido no in\u00edcio deste m\u00eas algumas licen\u00e7as para vend\u00ea-los. Se as quest\u00f5es geopol\u00edticas diminu\u00edrem e a empresa receber mais pedidos, a Nvidia disse que poderia adicionar de US$2 bilh\u00f5es a US$5 bilh\u00f5es em receita de chips H20 no terceiro trimestre.\n\nEmbora a previs\u00e3o da Nvidia tenha sido um pouco mais moderada do que o esperado, quaisquer vendas para a China no pr\u00f3ximo trimestre seriam adicionadas \u00e0 perspectiva, disse Ben Bajarin, presidente-executivo da empresa de consultoria em tecnologia Creative Strategies.\n\nAinda assim, a demanda aumentou para os chips avan\u00e7ados da Nvidia que podem processar rapidamente as grandes quantidades de dados usados por aplicativos de IA generativa, \u00e0 medida que as empresas correm umas contra as outras para dominar a nova tecnologia.\n\nA Nvidia tamb\u00e9m disse que havia autorizado um adicional de US$60 bilh\u00f5es em recompras de a\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\n(Reportagem de Arsheeya Bajwa em Bengaluru; Max A.

  "translation": "27 Aug (Reuters) - Nvidia's actions (NVDA.O) fell on Wednesday, as the destination of their businesses in China was uncertain, involved in the Washington and Beijing trade war.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang hopes to obtain permission to restart Nvidia's chip to sell to China after closing an agreement with US President Donald Trump to pay commissions to the US government. However, without formal rules in force in the US and with doubt whether Chinese regulators will discourage the purchase of Nvidia chips, the leading company in the artificial intelligence market has excluded potential sales to China from forecasting for the current quarter.\n\nAs a result, there was only a little encouraging perspective that, although still absolute in dollars and slightly above analysts estimates, disappointed investors accustomed to significant results and caused the shares to fall 3.2% in negotiations after the close of the trading session. The drop in shares cut about $ 110 billion from Nvidia's US $ 4.4 trillion market capitalization.\n\n\"Nvidia's biggest bottleneck is not silicon, it's diplomacy,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman, director of investment at Running Point Capital.\n\nThe chip manufacturer expects a revenue of $ 54 billion, about 2%, in the third quarter, compared to the average estimate of $ 53.14 billion analysts, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nNvidia also said it did not include any H20 chip shipments to China in its estimates, although it received some licenses earlier this month to sell them. If geopolitical issues decrease and the company receive more orders, Nvidia said it could add from $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion in revenue of H20 chips in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's forecast was a little more moderate than expected, any sales to China next quarter would be added to the perspective, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of the technology consulting firm Creative Strategies.\n\nStill, demand has increased to advanced Nvidia chips that can rapidly process large amounts of data used by Generative AI applications as companies run against each other to master the new technology.\n\nNvidia also said it had authorized an additional $ 60 billion in stock repurchase.\n\n(Report by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Max A.

The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company.
