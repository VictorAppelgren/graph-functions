  "description": "Connor Zilisch broke his collarbone while celebrating his NASCAR Xfinity Series win at Watkins Glen on Aug. 9. Surgery could be next for driver.",
  "content": "NASCAR driver Connor Zilisch, who broke his collarbone while celebrating his Xfinity Series victory at Watkins Glen International on Saturday, Aug. 9, is \u201cgrateful to be walking,\u201d after his scary fall.\n\nThe 19-year-old driver had taken the checkered flag in Saturday\u2019s race at the New York road course and was climbing out through the window to celebrate on the roof his car when one foot got caught in the window netting. Zilisch stumbled then took a hard fall to the pavement.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I remember is thinking, I don\u2019t know why, but I thought I was going to break my femur,\u201d Zilisch said Monday, Aug. 11, on the Door Bumper Clear podcast. \"My leg was stuck. I thought I was going to get caught in the headrest and just, I thought I was done.\u201d\n\nZilisch blacked out momentarily before on-track medical personnel rushed to his aid and whisked him away in an ambulance.\n\nOn the podcast, Zilisch revealed the first things he remembered saying to the medical personnel when he came to before they put him on stretcher with a neck brace.\n\n\u201cI was talking to the medics like, \u2018I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good. My shoulder hurts a little but that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018Why am I on a stretcher right now? I feel fine.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize what had happened.\u201d\n\nZilisch was back at Watkins Glen the next day for the NASCAR Cup Series, though only as a spectator. Trackhouse Racing withdrew the car they planned to have him drive in Sunday\u2019s race, which was eventually won by Trackhouse driver Shane Van Gisbergen.\n\nSpeaking to NBC Sports reporter Marty Snider during the Cup race, Zilisch expressed his relief and appreciation.\n\n\u201cSo, glad it wasn\u2019t any worse, and the collar bone was the extent of the injuries,\" he said. \u2026 Hopefully, my young bones will heal fast, and I\u2019ll be able to get back in it as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nZilisch said surgery might be his best option for a quick return to racing, and he has a window because the Xfinity Series is off Aug. 15-16, while both the Craftsman Truck and Cup series race at Richmond Raceway that weekend.\n\nZilisch, who drives in the Xfinity Series for JR Motorsports \u2013 the team co-owned by siblings Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kelley Earnhardt Miller \u2013 won his sixth race of the season at Watkins Glen and is likely to be one of the favorites for the 2025 Xfinity Series championship. But the first thing on the agenda is healing and recovery.\n\n\u201cI think it might be something that I might have to get surgery for. But in this case, I think surgery is something that speeds up the process, so you can get plates and screws and get it reconstructed back together,\" Zilisch said Monday on the Door Bumper Clear podcast.\n\n\u201cShane [van Gisbergen] talked about it. He had an injury in 2021 and broke his collarbone \u2014 he had plates, screws, everything done and he was racing back the next weekend. Thankfully, the collarbone is a relatively quick bone to fix and heal.\u201d\n\nThe Xfinity Series returns to racing on Aug. 22 at Daytona International Speedway, a track known for big crashes. Zilisch is the Xfinity points leader and has already missed one race this season due to a back injury.",
