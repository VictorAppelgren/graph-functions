  "content": "TABLE\u2019S SET \u2014 The California Legislature passed a blockbuster Bay Area sales tax measure, while killing a proposal to help homeless students find places to sleep in their cars and a Jay Leno-backed effort to exempt old, collector autos from smog tests.\n\nBut many of the most sensitive and fraught policy debates before lawmakers survived the so-called suspense file on Friday, from which appropriations committees quickly cull bills twice a year in Sacramento.\n\nNow on the docket with two weeks to go in the legislative year \u2026 efforts to change what California students are taught, maintain a signature climate program and give the legal weed industry a boost. Here are five issues to watch:\n\nCap-and-trade: The biggest question surrounding the state\u2019s carbon auctions revolves around how the system will be renewed, but the more urgent question is whether legislators and Gov. Gavin Newsom will be able to pull off any kind of deal in the coming weeks. They don\u2019t need to extend the life of the cap-and-trade system this year, but Newsom and legislative leaders have made clear they want to \u2014 rather than risk seeing wary investors pay less for carbon credits while the system is in limbo.\n\nEthnic studies: The legislative Jewish Caucus rallied around changing how ethnic studies are taught early this year, hoping to push a compromise through before the courses are mandatory. But a deal has not yet been struck amid tense debates over how to teach about Israel. AB 1468, the original proposal that would create new standards for ethnic studies instruction, hasn\u2019t moved forward in months after the Caucus pivoted its focus to a broader proposal targeting classroom antisemitism at the request of diversity caucus and education committee chairs. AB 715, which would impose penalties on schools found to be hostile toward Jewish students and restrict how schools teach about the Israel-Palestine conflict, is expected to be amended soon. It's in the Senate Education Committee where it's slated to get a hearing next week.\n\nTransit-oriented housing: Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s SB 79, a contentious proposal to require local governments to allow dense housing near public transit, took a significant haircut in the suspense process. Amendments removed some of the areas where the bill would apply, including some outside urban centers. That and other changes may be enough to quell opposition, though Assembly Appropriations Chair Buffy Wicks told reporters she was not sure after the bill passed through her panel.\n\n\u201cMy hope is it doesn't need more amendments, to be honest with you,\u201d Wicks, a housing-focused ally of Wiener, told reporters. \u201cBut in the legislative process, you go through every committee, you go through the floor, members have different needs, wants, desires \u2026 I think what he's trying to do here is the art of the possible.\u201d\n\nWeed tax: Assemblymember Matt Haney\u2019s attempt to blunt cannabis tax hikes was amended on suspense to add reporting requirements and change the timeline that rates would be in effect. But that leaves a hot debate over how to balance the struggles of California\u2019s legal weed industry \u2014 which has been battered by illicit competitors \u2014 with the state\u2019s desperate need for revenue in a tough budget year.\n\nCharter schools: It may not compare to the charter wars of 2019, but AB 84\u2019s California Teachers Association-backed rules for virtual charter schools have the education world\u2019s blood pumping again. The broad slate of audit and governance requirements made it through suspense in a narrowed form Friday. But pro-charter lobbyists will be prepared for a full-court press against the bill ahead of floor votes, after fighting new rules year after year after year.\n\nGOOD MORNING. Happy Tuesday.

The ad will be up on digital platforms as well.\n\n\u201cProposition 50 threatens the citizen-led redistricting process built by fair-minded Californians,\u201d Faith Bautista Tamashiro, president and CEO of the National Diversity Coalition, said in a statement touting the new ad. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to inform Californians on how this partisan gerrymander strips power from voters and hands it back to politicians.\u201d\n\n\n\nCASH FLOOD \u2014 Munger donated an additional $10 million to fight Prop 50, according to a campaign disclosure dated Friday, doubling the sum he has so far reported spending. As Playbook previously reported, people familiar with the no side\u2019s planning expected his contributions to reach at least $30 million.\n\nDemocratic megadonor Reed Hastings donated $2 million to the yes side last week, and philanthropist Laurie Michaels gave $750,000. The California Community Foundation also dropped $200,000 into a committee supporting the measure.\n\nWHAT VOTERS COULD SEE \u2014 The draft arguments in favor of Prop 50 are out. Signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, they argue \u201cDonald Trump and Texas Republicans are making an unprecedented power grab to steal congressional seats and rig the 2026 election before voting even begins,\u201d necessitating the measure.\n\n\u2014 While the yes campaign is linking itself to those household names in Democratic politics, the opposition arguments are signed by opponents few voters would know. They include Roberto Moncada, a board member at United Latinos Action, Faith Bautista Tamashiro, president of the National Diversity Coalition, and Taylor Shorty, a board member for Community RePower Movement. They argue the measure \u201cremoves requirements to keep cities, counties, and local communities together, and eliminates voter protections that ban maps designed to favor incumbents or political parties.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California President Jodi Hicks, Sacramento teachers union leader Nikki Davis Milevsky, and Sara Sadhwani, a Democratic member of the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission, authored a rebuttal. In it, they focus on Munger\u2019s past giving to socially conservative causes \u2014 which Democrats homed in on early while preparing to campaign for the measure.\n\nTHE FIGHT BEYOND CALIFORNIA \u2014 House Democrats are considering establishing an organization to raise and spend for their remapping efforts as they look to counter an aggressive Republican move that could determine control of the chamber next year. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has privately discussed redistricting with blue-state governors, our Lisa Kashinsky, Elena Schneider and Nicholas Wu report. And yet, Democrats face a lopsided national redistricting fight. Read more from our colleagues.\n\n\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: O.C. LOYALTY \u2014 Freshman Rep. Dave Min is wading into the governor\u2019s race, throwing his support behind fellow Orange County resident Katie Porter.\n\nPorter and Min, who now represents the coastal seat once held by Porter, had been rivals in the past. In 2018, the then-professors at UC Irvine squared off against each other in a fierce Democratic primary for Congress, which Porter ultimately won. But when Porter ran for Senate last year, she quickly backed Min to be her successor.\n\nNow, Min is returning the favor, praising the former representative as a \u201ctrue fighter\u201d in a statement first obtained by Playbook.\n\n\u201cAs a fellow educator, I know Katie will be laser focused on bringing down the cost of child care and college; she\u2019ll take on our housing crisis and lower the price of groceries, health care, and more,\u201d Min said. \u201cKatie can\u2019t be steamrolled, and I couldn\u2019t think of a stronger person to stand up for Californians as Trump lobs attack after attack at our state.\u201d\n\n\n\nSEAT FOR SOLIS \u2014 Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis on Friday confirmed rampant rumors that she will run for the new Democratic House seat in her county if Prop 50 passes.\n\n\u201cThe working people of Southern California are under assault by the Trump Administration \u2014 and I won\u2019t just stand by and let it happen,\u201d Solis said in a statement. \u201cAs the President attacks workers, immigrants, educators, housing that working people can afford, women\u2019s reproductive rights, veterans\u2019 services, labor unions, the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid/Medi-Cal \u2014 and democracy itself \u2014 we must fight back.\u201d\n\nSolis would run in the new 38th district, which would remain heavily Democratic but push incumbent 38th district Rep. Linda Sanchez into the new 41st district, which includes her home in Whittier.\n\nSolis served in the House from 2001 to 2009 before President Barack Obama appointed her to be his labor secretary. She enjoys potent institutional support, including endorsements from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, five California House Democrats as well as current and former state legislative leaders.\n\n\n\nNEWSOM\u2019S PLAYBOOK \u2014 Wes Moore has ramped up his anti-Trump social media strategy and floated redistricting in Maryland as he ponders a 2028 White House bid. Even so, the up-and-coming Democrat remains in Newsom\u2019s shadow, our colleague Brakkton Booker writes.\n\nThe Maryland governor recently lampooned Donald Trump as \u201cPresident Bone Spurs\u201d \u2014 following Newsom\u2019s all-caps social media posts mimicking Trump\u2019s signature Truth Social style. Moore says Maryland is open to redistricting to respond to a red state ambush, but any effort in his state has yet to take off while Newsom is leading California in an aggressive remapping push. Moore\u2019s trailing his West Coast counterpart in receiving Trump\u2019s ire, too: The president\u2019s threats to deploy the National Guard to Baltimore come months after he stationed them in Los Angeles, lending to Newsom\u2019s growing star power on the left.\n\n\n\nUNION DRIVE \u2014 California lawmakers reached an agreement Friday with Uber and Lyft that will open the door for app-based drivers to form unions, a victory for organized labor that could lay the groundwork for similar efforts in other states.\n\nThe deal, blessed by Newsom, brings Uber and Lyft on board with a pathway to collective bargaining rights for ride-hailing drivers after the companies spent years and massive sums of money fighting the idea. Read more from our Tyler Katzenberger. \n\n\n\nGUARD DEPLOYMENT DEFENSE \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday claimed Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard saved Los Angeles from nothing less than certain destruction \u2014 that \u201cL.A. wouldn\u2019t be standing today\u201d or \u201cwould have burned down\u201d if not for the president\u2019s intervention, writes our colleague Gregory Svirnovskiy.\n\nNewsom\u2019s office replied to Noem\u2019s interview on X, writing alongside a recording of the interview, \u201cHahahahahhahahahahahahahaha.\u201d\n\n\n\nNOT LETTING UP \u2014 Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie are once again pushing Speaker Mike Johnson on the Jeffrey Epstein saga. On Wednesday, they\u2019re planning to host a press conference with 10 of Epstein\u2019s victims, Khanna told NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d More from Svirnovskiy here.\n\n\n\nTOUGH GOAL \u2014 In cities hosting next year\u2019s World Cup, officials are growing nervous about the pressure of shouldering millions of dollars in security and logistical costs, our Sophia Cai reports. The federal government has supplied some help, but local governments are still scrambling to make up the difference.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit coming in, but certainly there is not enough to cover our cost,\u201d said Lisa Gillmor, mayor of Santa Clara, where six matches will be played. \u201cIt\u2019s a tall task to take on.\u201d\n\nSTRIFE SURROUNDING HALF DOME \u2014 Yosemite is down employees following the Trump administration\u2019s slashing of the federal workforce \u2014 worsening what were previously bipartisan concerns about understaffing. Workers there and at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks voted to unionize in response last month, but what will come of those efforts is unclear after the administration terminated collective bargaining agreements at the Environmental Protection Agency, writes Heather Richards of POLITICO\u2019s E&E News.\n\n\n\nELECTRIC PRESENCE \u2014 Rivian is getting vocal about the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on electric vehicles \u2014 and California\u2019s role as a counterbalance to them. Read Friday\u2019s California Climate for more on how the manufacturer is playing in state politics.\n\n\n\nESSAYLI EMPLOYMENT WATCH \u2014 The federal public defender\u2019s office in Los Angeles on Friday sought to remove U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli from the job, arguing he\u2019s not legally serving in the role since the Trump administration has avoided having him confirmed by the U.S. Senate using an unprecedented workaround.\n\nThe public defender\u2019s office filed a motion seeking to disqualify Essayli, a former Republican assemblymember, \u201cfrom participating in criminal prosecutions in\u201d the Central District of California, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nDEMON TIME \u2014 Nicole Shanahan, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s former running mate, recently questioned whether the Burning Man festival is \u201cdemonic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have come to believe that Burning Man is not just an eccentric festival, but rather a powerful vehicle for deception,\u201d she wrote in a social media post spotted by the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cIn fact, it may be one of the most effective tools for Satan to misdirect souls away from our Heavenly Father.\u201d\n\nNOT LAUGHING \u2014 San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, the moderate Democrat who frequently criticizes his party in Sacramento, is tired of Newsom\u2019s social media antics. In an editorial in the San Francisco Standard, Mahan called the Trumpian parody posts a \u201cblind leap into meme land.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be a winning strategy for his presidential campaign, but it\u2019s a losing one for improving the lives of Californians,\u201d Mahan wrote.\n\nBROTHERLY LOVE \u2014 Democratic strategist Jim Ross and Republican consultant Tom Ross, who is fighting Prop 50, are as divided on redistricting as can be. But Los Angeles Times columnist Mark Z. Barabak writes that \u201cthe two are brothers who, despite their differences, harbor an abiding love and respect for one another, along with an ironclad resolve that nothing \u2014 no campaign, no candidate, no political issue \u2014 can or ever will be allowed to drive a wedge between them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Attorney General Rob Bonta\u2019s sharp criticism of Big Oil is at the heart of a defamation suit filed by Exxon that\u2019s being litigated in Texas. (New York Times)\n\n\u2014 Santa Clara County is projected to build 38 percent more units with the help of a 2016 bond than originally anticipated. (Mercury News)\n\n\u2014 The Fresno Unified School District\u2019s spokesperson resigned earlier this year after using AI to fabricate quotes and information. Now, her replacement is facing scrutiny after sharing a social media post calling Israel a \u201cterrorist\u201d state. (San Joaquin Valley Sun)\n\n\n\nMUSIC MOVES \u2014 Former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb\u2019s Curb Records released two albums related to the 2024 film \u201cReagan,\u201d which was centered on Curb\u2019s mentor, President Ronald Reagan.\n\nPEOPLE MOVES \u2014 Eric Heighberger is now senior director of federal affairs for LA28, the host committee for the Los Angeles Olympics and Paralympics. He previously was staff director at the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\n\u2014 Nina Fisher has been named vice president of comms for the California Manufacturers & Technology Association. She was most recently comms director for state Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones.\n\nBELATED B-DAY WISHES \u2014 (was Monday): Playbook\u2019s Dustin Gardiner (cake flavor: marzipan) \u2026 (was Sunday): Antoinette Ratcliffe at Initiate Justice \u2026 Gwen Gunheim at Whole Consulting \u2026\n\nWANT A SHOUT-OUT FEATURED? \u2014 Send us a birthday, career move or another special occasion to include in POLITICO\u2019s California Playbook.

  "summary": "The California Legislature passed a major Bay Area sales tax measure and killed a proposal to help homeless students find places to sleep in their cars. However, many of the most sensitive policy debates survived the so-called suspense file, which is used to cull bills twice a year in Sacramento. Key issues include the renewal of the cap-and-trade system, which has been in limbo, and efforts to change what California students are taught, maintain a climate program and boost the legal weed industry. The legislative Jewish Caucus has been trying to compromise on how to teach about Israel, but a deal has not yet been reached. Transportation-oriented housing proposal, SB 79, was significantly reduced in the suspense process. Assemblymember Matt Haney's attempt to curb cannabis tax hikes was amended to add reporting requirements and change the timeline that rates would be implemented.",

      "text": "Their brotherly love transcends politics \u2014 and California\u2019s tooth-and-nail redistricting fight\n- Share via\n- Democrat Jim Ross and Republican Tom Ross have an ironclad commitment that no candidate or issue will pry them apart.\n- It\u2019s priceless, the brothers say, to have a relationship grounded in empathy and implicit trust.\nINCLINE VILLAGE, Nev. \u2014 Jim Ross has had a long and fruitful career as a Democratic campaign strategist. Among his victories was electing Gavin Newsom as San Francisco mayor.\nTom Ross has enjoyed similar success on the Republican side. He counts Kevin McCarthy\u2019s election to the Legislature and, later, Congress, among his wins.\nBut perhaps his most important achievement, Tom Ross said, was working on the 2008 campaign that established California\u2019s independent redistricting commission \u2014 \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for fair and impartial political map-making. \u201cIt needs protecting,\u201d he said.\nNo, said Jim Ross. It needs overriding.\nHe backs Newsom\u2019s effort to undo the commission\u2019s work in favor of a gerrymander that could boost Democratic chances of winning the House in 2026 \u2014 or else, he fears, \u201cthere will be ongoing Republican domination of politics ... for decades to come.\u201d\nThe two are brothers who, despite their differences, harbor an abiding love and respect for one another, along with an ironclad resolve that nothing \u2014 no campaign, no candidate, no political issue \u2014 can or ever will be allowed to drive a wedge between them.\nBarabak: They worked hard to draw fair political maps. How do they feel about Newsom undoing them?\nMembers of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, created by voters to leash politicians, are divided over Democrats\u2019 gerrymandering effort. But they\u2019re uniformly proud of their work.\n\u201cTom\u2019s the best person I know. The best person I know,\u201d Jim, 57, said as his brother, 55, sat across from him at a local burrito joint, tearing up. \u201cThere\u2019s issues we could go round and round on, which we\u2019re not going to do.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially,\u201d said Tom, \u201cwith someone you care about and love.\u201d\nThat sort of fraternal bond, transcending partisanship and one of the most heated political fights of this charged moment, shouldn\u2019t be unusual or particularly noteworthy \u2014 even for a pair who make their living working for parties locked in furious combat. But in these vexing and highly contentious times it surely is.\nMaybe there\u2019s something others can take away.\n::\nThe Ross brothers grew up in Incline Village, not far from where Nevada meets California. That was decades ago, before the forested hamlet on Tahoe\u2019s east shore became a playground for the rich and ultra-rich.\nThe family \u2014 Mom, Dad, four boys and a girl \u2014 settled there after John Ross retired from a career in the Air Force, which included three combat tours in Vietnam.\nJohn and his wife, Joan, weren\u2019t especially political, though they were active and civic-minded. Joan was involved in the Catholic church. John, who took up a career in real estate, worked on ways to improve the community.\nThe lessons they taught their children were grounded in duty, discipline and detail. Early on, the kids learned there\u2019s no such thing as a free ride. Jim got his first job at the 76 station, before he could drive. Tom mowed lawns, washed cars and ran a lemonade stand. The least fortunate among the siblings wore a bear suit and waved a sign, trying to shag customers for their dad\u2019s real estate business.\nTo this day, the brothers disdain anything that smacks of entitlement. \u201cThat\u2019s our family,\u201d Jim said. \u201cWe\u2019re all workers.\u201d\nLike their parents, the two weren\u2019t politically active growing up. They ended up majoring in government and political science \u2014 Jim at Saint Mary\u2019s College in the Bay Area, Tom at Gonzaga University in Washington state \u2014 as a kind of default. Both had instructors who brought the subject to life.\nJim\u2019s start in the profession came in his junior year when Clint Reilly, then one of California premier campaign strategists, came to speak to his college class. It was the first time Jim realized it was possible to make a living in politics \u2014 and Reilly\u2019s snazzy suit suggested it could be a lucrative one.\nJim interned for Reilly and after graduating and knocking about for a time \u2014 teaching skiing in Tahoe, working as a sales rep for Banana Boat sunscreen \u2014 he tapped an acquaintance from Reilly\u2019s firm to land a job with Frank Jordan\u2019s 1991 campaign for San Francisco mayor.\nFrom there, Jim moved on to a state Assembly race in Wine Country, just as Tom was graduating and looking for work. Using his connections, Jim helped Tom find a job as the driver for a congressional candidate in the area.\nAt the time, both were Republicans, like their father. Their non-ideological approach to politics also reflected the thinking of Col. Ross. Public service wasn\u2019t about party pieties, Jim said, but rather \u201cfinding a solution to a problem.\u201d\nJim\u2019s drift away from the GOP began when he worked for another Republican Assembly candidate whom he remembers, distastefully, as reflexively partisan, homophobic and anti-worker. His changed outlook solidified after several months working on a 1992 Louisiana congressional race. The grinding poverty he saw in the South was shocking, Jim said, and its remedy seemed well beyond the up-by-your-bootstraps nostrums he\u2019d absorbed.\nJim came to see government as a necessary agent for change and improvement, and that made the Democratic Party a more natural home. \u201cThere\u2019s not one thing that has bettered human existence that hasn\u2019t had, at its core, our ability to work collectively,\u201d Jim said. \u201cAnd our ability to work collectively comes down to government.\u201d\nTom looked on placidly, a Latin rhythm capering overhead.\nHe believes that success, and personal fulfillment, lies in individual achievement. The Republicans he admires include Jack Kemp, the rare member of his party who focused on urban poverty, and the George W. Bush of 2000, who ran for president as a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d with a strong record of bipartisan accomplishment as Texas governor.\n(Tom is no fan of Donald Trump, finding the president\u2019s casual cruelty toward people particularly off-putting.)\nHe distinctly remembers the moment, at age 22, when he realized he was standing on his own two feet, financially supporting himself and making his way in the world through the power of his own perseverance.\n\u201cFor me, that\u2019s what Republicans should be,\u201d Tom said. \u201cHow do you give people that experience in life? That\u2019s what we should be trying to do.\u201d\n::\nNewsom\u2019s 2003 campaign for San Francisco mayor was a brutal one, typical of the city\u2019s elbows-out, alley-fighting politics.\nIt took a physical toll on Jim Ross, Newsom\u2019s campaign manager, who suffered chest pains and, at one point, wound up in the hospital. Was the strain worth it, he wondered. Should he quit?\n\u201cThe only person I could really call and talk to was Tom,\u201d Jim said. \u201cHe understands what it is to work that hard on a campaign. And he wasn\u2019t going to go and leak it to the press, or tell someone who would use it in some way to hurt me.\u201d\nThat kind of empathy and implicit trust, which runs both ways, far outweighs any political considerations, the two said. Why would they surrender such a deep and meaningful relationship for some short-term tactical gain, or allow a disagreement over personalities or policy to set things asunder?\nJim lives and works out of the East Bay. Tom runs his business from Sacramento. The two faced each other on the campaign battlefield just once, squaring off over a 2018 ballot measure that sought to expand rent control in California. The initiative was rejected.\nThough they\u2019ve staked opposing positions on Newsom\u2019s redistricting measure, Proposition 50, Jim has no formal role in the Democratic campaign. Tom is working to defeat it.\nThe brief airing of their differences was unusual, coming solely at the behest of your friendly columnist. As a rule, the brothers talk business but avoid politics; there\u2019s hardly a need \u2014 they already know where each other is coming from. After all, they shared a bedroom growing up.\nJim had a story to tell.\nLast spring, as their mother lay dying, the two left the hospital in Reno to shower and get a bit of rest at their father\u2019s place in Incline Village. The phone rang. It was the overnight nurse, calling to let them know their mom had passed away.\n\u201cTom takes the call,\u201d Jim said. \u201cThe first thing he says to the nurse is, \u2018Are you OK? Is it hard for you to deal with this?\u2019 And that\u2019s how Tom is. Major thing, but he thinks about the other person first.\u201d\nHe laughed, a loud gale. \u201cI\u2019m not that way.\u201d\nWe calculated the margin of victory between Democrats and Republicans in Newsom\u2019s redistricting effort. Here are the results.\nTom had a story to tell.\nIn 2017, he bought a mountain bike, to celebrate the end of his treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He\u2019d been worn out by six months of chemotherapy and wasn\u2019t anywhere near full strength. Still, he was determined to tackle one of Tahoe\u2019s most scenic rides, which involves a lung-searing, roughly five-mile climb.\nTom walked partway, then got back on his bike and powered uphill through the last 500 or so yards.\nWaiting for him up top was Jim, seated alongside two strangers. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother,\u201d he proudly pointed out. \u201cHe beat cancer.\u201d\nTom\u2019s eyes welled.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nJim Ross, a Democratic campaign strategist who helped elect Gavin Newsom as San Francisco mayor, supports overriding California\u2019s independent redistricting commission\u2019s work in favor of a partisan gerrymander that would boost Democratic chances in the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe strategist argues that without this intervention, there will be \u201congoing Republican domination of politics for decades to come,\u201d suggesting that Democratic gerrymandering is necessary as a defensive measure against Republican electoral advantages.\nSome commission members share similar concerns about the broader political landscape. Patricia Sinay, a Democrat who served on the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, expresses ambivalence about the proposed gerrymander, understanding it as a \u201ctit-for-tat response to a similar Republican gerrymander in Texas, done at President Trump\u2019s behest to shore up the GOP\u2019s chances ahead of a perilous 2026 midterm election\u201d[1].\nSinay further emphasizes the national stakes involved, stating that \u201cthe voices that we need to speak up for now are not just our individual congressional districts\u201d but rather \u201cthe voices of our nation, for the soul of our nation\u201d[1].\nDifferent views on the topic\nTom Ross, a Republican strategist who worked on Kevin McCarthy\u2019s campaigns and helped establish California\u2019s independent redistricting commission in 2008, strongly opposes the proposed gerrymander, calling the commission system \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for fair and impartial political map-making that \u201cneeds protecting.\u201d\nThe independent redistricting commission was specifically designed to prevent exactly this type of political manipulation, as it was created to ensure that \u201cvoters \u2014 not politicians \u2014 decide how electoral districts are drawn\u201d and to make \u201celections determined by voters, not by politicians who draw maps\u201d[3].\nHistorical data demonstrates that midcycle redistricting for partisan advantage is exceptionally rare and problematic. Since 1970, only two states \u2013 Texas in 2003 and this year, and Georgia in 2005 \u2013 have voluntarily redrawn their congressional maps between censuses for partisan advantage[2].\nNeal Fornaciari, the Republican chair of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, while declining to state personal views on the Democratic gerrymander, emphasizes that the commission \u201cis in no way involved in this redistricting effort\u201d and that commissioners speaking out are \u201cexercising their 1st Amendment right to free speech\u201d as individuals[1].\nThe commission system was established through voter approval of Proposition 11 in 2008, spearheaded by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to \u201cbring balance to legislative races by taking redistricting away from lawmakers, who tended to draw the state\u2019s political lines to suit their interests and minimize competition\u201d[1]."

      "text": "47605.\n(a) (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), a petition for the establishment of a charter school within a school district may be circulated by one or more persons seeking to establish the charter school. A petition for the establishment of a charter school shall identify a single charter school that will operate within the geographic boundaries of that school district. A charter school may propose to operate at multiple sites within the school district if each location is identified in the charter school petition. The petition may be submitted to the governing board of the school district for review after either of the following conditions is met:(A) The petition is signed by a number of parents or legal guardians of pupils that is\nequivalent to at least one-half of the number of pupils that the charter school estimates will enroll in the charter school for its first year of operation.\n(B) The petition is signed by a number of teachers that is equivalent to at least one-half of the number of teachers that the charter school estimates will be employed at the charter school during its first year of operation.\n(2) A petition that proposes to convert an existing public school to a charter school that would not be eligible for a loan pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 41365 may be circulated by one or more persons seeking to establish the charter school. The petition may be submitted to the governing board of the school district for review after the petition is signed by not less than 50 percent of the permanent status teachers currently employed at the public school to be converted.\n(3) A petition shall include a prominent statement that a signature on the petition means that the parent or legal guardian is meaningfully interested in having their child or ward attend the charter school, or in the case of a teacher\u2019s signature, means that the teacher is meaningfully interested in teaching at the charter school. The proposed charter shall be attached to the petition.\n(4) After receiving approval of its petition, a charter school that proposes to expand operations to one or more additional sites or grade levels shall request a material revision to its charter and shall notify the chartering authority of those additional locations or grade levels. The chartering authority shall consider whether to approve those additional locations or grade levels at an open, public meeting. If the additional locations or grade levels are approved pursuant to the standards and\ncriteria described in subdivision (c), they shall be a material revision to the charter school\u2019s charter.\n(5) (A) A charter school that established one site outside the boundaries of the school district, but within the county in which that school district is located before January 1, 2020, may continue to operate that site until the charter school submits a request for the renewal of its charter petition. To continue operating the site, the charter school shall do either of the following:\n(i) First, before submitting the request for the renewal of the charter petition, obtain approval in writing from the school district where the site is operating.\n(ii) Submit a request for the renewal of the charter petition pursuant to Section 47607 to the school district in which the charter school is\nlocated.\n(B) If a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency is issued in accordance with the federal Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 5121 et seq.) for an area in which a charter schoolsite is located and operating, the charter school, for not more than five years, may relocate that site outside the area subject to the Presidential declaration if the charter school first obtains the written approval of the school district where the site is being relocated to.\n(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a charter school was relocated from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2019, inclusive, due to a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency in accordance with the federal Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 5121 et seq.), that charter school shall be allowed to\nreturn to its original campus location in perpetuity.\n(D) (i) A charter school in operation and providing educational services to pupils before October 1, 2019, located on a federally recognized California Indian reservation or rancheria or operated by a federally recognized California Indian tribe shall be exempt from the geographic restrictions of paragraph (1) and subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the geographic restrictions of subdivision (a) of Section 47605.1.\n(ii) The exemption to the geographic restrictions of subdivision (a) of Section 47605.1 in clause (i) does not apply to nonclassroom-based charter schools operating pursuant to Section 47612.5.\n(E) The department shall regard as a continuing charter school for all purposes a charter school that was granted approval of its\npetition, that was providing educational services to pupils before October 1, 2019, and is authorized by a different chartering authority due to changes to this paragraph that took effect January 1, 2020. This paragraph shall be implemented only to the extent it does not conflict with federal law. In order to prevent any potential conflict with federal law, this paragraph does not apply to covered programs as identified in Section 8101(11) of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801) to the extent the affected charter school is the restructured portion of a divided charter school pursuant to Section 47654.\n(6) Commencing January 1, 2003, a petition to establish a charter school shall not be approved to serve pupils in a grade level that is not served by the school district of the governing board considering the petition, unless the petition proposes to serve pupils in all of the grade levels served by that\nschool district.\n(b) No later than 60 days after receiving a petition, in accordance with subdivision (a), the governing board of the school district shall hold a public hearing on the provisions of the charter, at which time the governing board of the school district shall consider the level of support for the petition by teachers employed by the school district, other employees of the school district, and parents. Following review of the petition and the public hearing, the governing board of the school district shall either grant or deny the charter within 90 days of receipt of the petition, provided, however, that the date may be extended by an additional 30 days if both parties agree to the extension. A petition is deemed received by the governing board of the school district for purposes of commencing the timelines described in this subdivision on the day the petitioner submits a petition to the district office, along with a signed\ncertification that the petitioner deems the petition to be complete. The governing board of the school district shall publish all staff recommendations, including the recommended findings and, if applicable, the certification from the county superintendent of schools prepared pursuant to paragraph (8) of subdivision (c), regarding the petition at least 15 days before the public hearing at which the governing board of the school district will either grant or deny the charter. At the public hearing at which the governing board of the school district will either grant or deny the charter, petitioners shall have equivalent time and procedures to present evidence and testimony to respond to the staff recommendations and findings.\n(c) In reviewing petitions for the establishment of charter schools pursuant to this section, the chartering authority shall be guided by the intent of the Legislature that charter schools are and should become an integral\npart of the California educational system and that the establishment of charter schools should be encouraged. The governing board of the school district shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice and with the interests of the community in which the school is proposing to locate. The governing board of the school district shall consider the academic needs of the pupils the school proposes to serve. The governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings, specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings:\n(1) The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\n(2) The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\n(3) The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision (a).\n(4) The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision (e).\n(5) The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following:\n(A) (i) The educational program of the charter school, designed, among other things, to identify those whom the charter school is attempting to educate, what it means to be an \u201ceducated person\u201d in the 21st century, and how learning best occurs. The goals identified in that program shall include the objective of enabling\npupils to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.\n(ii) The annual goals for the charter school for all pupils and for each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to Section 52052, to be achieved in the state priorities, as described in subdivision (d) of Section 52060, that apply for the grade levels served, and specific annual actions to achieve those goals. A charter petition may identify additional school priorities, the goals for the school priorities, and the specific annual actions to achieve those goals.\n(iii) If the proposed charter school will serve high school pupils, the manner in which the charter school will inform parents about the transferability of courses to other public high schools and the eligibility of courses to meet college entrance requirements. Courses offered by the charter school that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools\nand Colleges may be considered transferable and courses approved by the University of California or the California State University as creditable under the \u201cA to G\u201d admissions criteria may be considered to meet college entrance requirements.\n(B) The measurable pupil outcomes identified for use by the charter school. \u201cPupil outcomes,\u201d for purposes of this part, means the extent to which all pupils of the charter school demonstrate that they have attained the skills, knowledge, and attitudes specified as goals in the charter school\u2019s educational program. Pupil outcomes shall include outcomes that address increases in pupil academic achievement both schoolwide and for all pupil subgroups served by the charter school, as that term is defined in subdivision (a) of Section 52052. The pupil outcomes shall align with the state priorities, as described in subdivision (d) of Section 52060, that apply for the grade levels served by the charter school.\n(C) The method by which pupil progress in meeting those pupil outcomes is to be measured. To the extent practicable, the method for measuring pupil outcomes for state priorities shall be consistent with the way information is reported on a school accountability report card.\n(D) The governance structure of the charter school, including, but not limited to, the process to be followed by the charter school to ensure parental involvement.\n(E) The qualifications to be met by individuals to be employed by the charter school.\n(F) The procedures that the charter school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupils and staff. These procedures shall require all of the following:\n(i) That each\nemployee of the charter school furnish the charter school with a criminal record summary as described in Section 44237.\n(ii) For all schools, the development of a school safety plan, which shall include the safety topics listed in subparagraphs (A) to (J), inclusive, of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 32282. For schools serving pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, the development of a school safety plan shall also include the safety topic listed in subparagraph (K) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 32282.\n(iii) That the school safety plan be reviewed and updated by March 1 of every year by the charter school.\n(G) The means by which the charter school will achieve a balance of racial and ethnic pupils, special education pupils, and English learner pupils, including redesignated fluent\nEnglish proficient pupils, as defined by the evaluation rubrics in Section 52064.5, that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the school district to which the charter petition is submitted. Upon renewal, for a charter school not deemed to be a local educational agency for purposes of special education pursuant to Section 47641, the chartering authority may consider the effect of school placements made by the chartering authority in providing a free and appropriate public education as required by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Public Law 101-476), on the balance of pupils with disabilities at the charter school.\n(H) Admission policies and procedures, consistent with subdivision (e).\n(I) The manner in which annual, independent financial audits shall be conducted, which shall employ generally accepted\naccounting principles, and the manner in which audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the chartering authority.\n(J) The procedures by which pupils can be suspended or expelled from the charter school for disciplinary reasons or otherwise involuntarily removed from the charter school for any reason. These procedures, at a minimum, shall include an explanation of how the charter school will comply with federal and state constitutional procedural and substantive due process requirements that are consistent with all of the following:\n(i) For suspensions of fewer than 10 days, provide oral or written notice of the charges against the pupil and, if the pupil denies the charges, an explanation of the evidence that supports the charges and an opportunity for the pupil to present the pupil\u2019s side of the story.\n(ii) For suspensions of 10 days or more and all other expulsions for disciplinary reasons, both of the following:\n(I) Provide timely, written notice of the charges against the pupil and an explanation of the pupil\u2019s basic rights.\n(II) Provide a hearing adjudicated by a neutral officer within a reasonable number of days at which the pupil has a fair opportunity to present testimony, evidence, and witnesses and confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and at which the pupil has the right to bring legal counsel or an advocate.\n(iii) Contain a clear statement that no pupil shall be involuntarily removed by the charter school for any reason unless the parent or guardian of the pupil has been provided written notice of intent to remove the pupil no less than\nfive schooldays before the effective date of the action. The written notice shall be in the native language of the pupil or the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, or, if the pupil is a homeless child or youth, or a foster child or youth, in the native language of the homeless or foster child\u2019s educational rights holder. In the case of a foster child or youth, the written notice shall also be provided to the foster child\u2019s attorney and county social worker. If the pupil is an Indian child, as defined in Section 224.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the written notice shall also be provided to the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker. The written notice shall inform the pupil, the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, the homeless child\u2019s educational rights holder, the foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker of the right to initiate the procedures specified in\nclause (ii) before the effective date of the action. If the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, the homeless child\u2019s educational rights holder, the foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, or county social worker, or the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker or, if applicable, county social worker initiates the procedures specified in clause (ii), the pupil shall remain enrolled and shall not be removed until the charter school issues a final decision. For purposes of this clause, \u201cinvoluntarily removed\u201d includes disenrolled, dismissed, transferred, or terminated, but does not include suspensions specified in clauses (i) and (ii).\n(iv) A foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker and an Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker shall have the same rights a parent or guardian of a child has to receive a suspension notice, expulsion notice, manifestation determination notice,\ninvoluntary transfer notice, and other documents and related information.\n(K) The manner by which staff members of the charter schools will be covered by the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or federal social security.\n(L) The public school attendance alternatives for pupils residing within the school district who choose not to attend charter schools.\n(M) The rights of an employee of the school district upon leaving the employment of the school district to work in a charter school, and of any rights of return to the school district after employment at a charter school.\n(N) The procedures to be followed by the charter school and the chartering authority to resolve disputes relating to provisions of the\ncharter.\n(O) The procedures to be used if the charter school closes. The procedures shall ensure a final audit of the charter school to determine the disposition of all assets and liabilities of the charter school, including plans for disposing of any net assets and for the maintenance and transfer of pupil records. If the charter school leases or rents its facility from a related party or subsidiary, as identified in its audited financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or owns its facility, the charter school shall include a statement describing its plans for the use of the facility in its final audit.\n(6) The petition does not contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter 10.7 (commencing with Section\n3540) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code.\n(7) The charter school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is proposing to locate. Analysis of this finding shall include consideration of the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. A written factual finding under this paragraph shall detail specific facts and circumstances that analyze and consider the following factors:\n(A) The extent to which the proposed charter school would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings.\n(B) Whether the proposed charter school would duplicate a program currently offered within the school district and the existing program has sufficient capacity for the pupils proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the\ncharter school intends to locate.\n(8) The school district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. A school district satisfies this paragraph if it has a qualified interim certification pursuant to Section 42131 and the county superintendent of schools, in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, certifies that approving the charter school would result in the school district having a negative interim certification pursuant to Section 42131, has a negative interim certification pursuant to Section 42131, or is under state receivership. Charter schools proposed in a school district satisfying one of these conditions shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption of denial.\n(d) (1) Charter schools shall meet all statewide standards and conduct the pupil assessments required pursuant to\nSection 60605 and any other statewide standards authorized in statute or pupil assessments applicable to pupils in noncharter public schools.\n(2) Charter schools shall, on a regular basis, consult with their parents, legal guardians, and teachers regarding the charter school\u2019s educational programs.\n(e) (1) In addition to any other requirement imposed under this part, a charter school shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations, shall not charge tuition, and shall not discriminate against a pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Section 220. Except as provided in paragraph (2), admission to a charter school shall not be determined according to the place of residence of the pupil, or of that pupil\u2019s parent or legal guardian, within this state, except that an existing public school\nconverting partially or entirely to a charter school under this part shall adopt and maintain a policy giving admission preference to pupils who reside within the former attendance area of that public school.\n(2) (A) A charter school shall admit all pupils who wish to attend the charter school.\n(B) If the number of pupils who wish to attend the charter school exceeds the charter school\u2019s capacity, attendance, except for existing pupils of the charter school, shall be determined by a public random drawing. Preference shall be extended to pupils currently attending the charter school and pupils who reside in the school district except as provided for in Section 47614.5. Preferences, including, but not limited to, siblings of pupils admitted or attending the charter school and children of the charter school\u2019s teachers, staff, and founders identified in the\ninitial charter, may also be permitted by the chartering authority on an individual charter school basis. Priority order for any preference shall be determined in the charter petition in accordance with all of the following:\n(i) Each type of preference shall be approved by the chartering authority at a public hearing.\n(ii) Preferences shall be consistent with federal law, the California Constitution, and Section 200.\n(iii) Preferences shall not result in limiting enrollment access for pupils with disabilities, academically low-achieving pupils, English learners, neglected or delinquent pupils, homeless pupils, or pupils who are economically disadvantaged, as determined by eligibility for any free or reduced-price meal program, foster youth, or pupils based on nationality, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.\n(iv) In accordance with Section 49011, preferences shall not require mandatory parental volunteer hours as a criterion for admission or continued enrollment.\n(C) In the event of a drawing, the chartering authority shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the growth of the charter school and shall not take any action to impede the charter school from expanding enrollment to meet pupil demand.\n(3) If a pupil is expelled or leaves the charter school without graduating or completing the school year for any reason, the charter school shall notify the superintendent of the school district of the pupil\u2019s last known address within 30 days, and shall, upon request, provide that school district with a copy of the cumulative record of the pupil, including report cards or a transcript of grades, and health information. If the\npupil is subsequently expelled or leaves the school district without graduating or completing the school year for any reason, the school district shall provide this information to the charter school within 30 days if the charter school demonstrates that the pupil had been enrolled in the charter school. This paragraph applies only to pupils subject to compulsory full-time education pursuant to Section 48200.\n(4) (A) A charter school shall not discourage a pupil from enrolling or seeking to enroll in the charter school for any reason, including, but not limited to, academic performance of the pupil or because the pupil exhibits any of the characteristics described in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2).\n(B) A charter school shall not request a pupil\u2019s records or require a parent, guardian, or pupil to submit the pupil\u2019s records to the charter\nschool before enrollment.\n(C) A charter school shall not encourage a pupil currently attending the charter school to disenroll from the charter school or transfer to another school for any reason, including, but not limited to, academic performance of the pupil or because the pupil exhibits any of the characteristics described in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2). This subparagraph shall not apply to actions taken by a charter school pursuant to the procedures described in subparagraph (J) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (c).\n(D) The department shall develop a notice of the requirements of this paragraph. This notice shall be posted on a charter school\u2019s internet website. A charter school shall provide a parent or guardian, or a pupil if the pupil is 18 years of age or older, a copy of this notice at all of the following times:\n(i) When a parent, guardian, or pupil inquires about enrollment.\n(ii) Before conducting an enrollment lottery.\n(iii) Before disenrollment of a pupil.\n(E) (i) A person who suspects that a charter school has violated this paragraph may file a complaint with the chartering authority.\n(ii) The department shall develop a template to be used for filing complaints pursuant to clause (i).\n(5) Notwithstanding any other law, a charter school in operation as of July 1, 2019, that operates in partnership with the California National Guard may dismiss a pupil from the charter school for failing to maintain the minimum\nstandards of conduct required by the Military Department.\n(f) The governing board of a school district shall not require an employee of the school district to be employed in a charter school.\n(g) The governing board of a school district shall not require a pupil enrolled in the school district to attend a charter school.\n(h) The governing board of a school district shall require that the petitioner or petitioners provide information regarding the proposed operation and potential effects of the charter school, including, but not limited to, the facilities to be used by the charter school, the manner in which administrative services of the charter school are to be provided, and potential civil liability effects, if any, upon the charter school and upon the school district. The description of the facilities to be used\nby the charter school shall specify where the charter school intends to locate. The petitioner or petitioners also shall be required to provide financial statements that include a proposed first-year operational budget, including startup costs, and cashflow and financial projections for the first three years of operation. If the school is to be operated by, or as, a nonprofit public benefit corporation, the petitioner shall provide the names and relevant qualifications of all persons whom the petitioner nominates to serve on the governing body of the charter school.\n(i) In reviewing petitions for the establishment of charter schools within the school district, the governing board of the school district shall give preference to petitions that demonstrate the capability to provide comprehensive learning experiences to pupils identified by the petitioner or petitioners as academically low achieving pursuant to the standards established by the\ndepartment under Section 54032, as that section read before July 19, 2006.\n(j) Upon the approval of the petition by the governing board of the school district, the petitioner or petitioners shall provide written notice of that approval, including a copy of the petition, to the applicable county superintendent of schools, the department, and the state board.\n(k) (1) (A) (i) If the governing board of a school district denies a petition, the petitioner may elect to submit the petition for the establishment of a charter school to the county board of education. The petitioner shall submit the petition to the county board of education within 30 days of a denial by the governing board of the school district. At the same time the petition is submitted to the county board of education, the petitioner shall also provide a\ncopy of the petition to the school district. The county board of education shall review the petition pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c). If the petition submitted on appeal contains new or different material terms, the county board of education shall immediately remand the petition to the governing board of the school district for reconsideration, which shall grant or deny the petition within 30 days. If the governing board of the school district denies a petition after reconsideration, the petitioner may elect to resubmit the petition for the establishment of a charter school to the county board of education.\n(ii) The county board of education shall review the appeal petition pursuant to subdivision (c). If the denial of the petition was made pursuant to paragraph (8) of subdivision (c), the county board of education shall also review the school district\u2019s findings pursuant to paragraph (8) of subdivision (c).\n(iii) As used in this subdivision, \u201cmaterial terms\u201d of the petition means the signatures, affirmations, disclosures, documents, and descriptions described in subdivisions (a), (b), (c), and (h), but shall not include minor administrative updates to the petition or related documents due to changes in circumstances based on the passage of time related to fiscal affairs, facilities arrangements, or state law, or to reflect the county board of education as the chartering authority.\n(B) If the governing board of a school district denies a petition and the county board of education has jurisdiction over a single school district, the petitioner may elect to submit the petition for the establishment of a charter school to the state board. The state board shall review a petition submitted pursuant to this subparagraph pursuant to subdivision (c). If the denial of a charter petition is\nreversed by the state board pursuant to this subparagraph, the state board shall designate the governing board of the school district in which the charter school is located as the chartering authority.\n(2) If the county board of education denies a petition, the petitioner may appeal that denial to the state board.\n(A) The petitioner shall submit the petition to the state board within 30 days of a denial by the county board of education. The petitioner shall include the findings and documentary record from the governing board of the school district and the county board of education and a written submission detailing, with specific citations to the documentary record, how the governing board of the school district and the county board of education abused their discretion. The governing board of the school district and county board of education shall prepare the documentary record,\nincluding transcripts of the public hearing at which the governing board of the school district and county board of education denied the charter, at the request of the petitioner. The documentary record shall be prepared by the governing board of the school district and county board of education no later than 10 business days after the request of the petitioner is made. At the same time the petition and supporting documentation is submitted to the state board, the petitioner shall also provide a copy of the petition and supporting documentation to the school district and the county board of education.\n(B) If the appeal contains new or different material terms, as defined in clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), the state board shall immediately remand the petition to the governing board of the school district to which the petition was submitted for reconsideration.

Based on its review, the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools shall submit a recommendation to the state board whether there is sufficient evidence to hear the appeal or to summarily deny review of the appeal based on the documentary record. If the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools does not submit a recommendation to the state board, the state board shall consider the appeal, and shall either hear the appeal or summarily deny review of the appeal based on the documentary record at a regular public meeting of the state board.\n(E) The state board shall either hear the appeal or summarily deny review of the appeal based on the documentary record. If the state board hears the appeal, the state board may affirm the determination of the governing board of the school district or the county board of education, or both of those determinations, or may reverse only upon a\ndetermination that there was an abuse of discretion by each of the governing board of the school district and the county board of education. Abuse of discretion is the most deferential standard of review, under which the state board must give deference to the decisions of the governing board of the school district and the county board of education to deny the petition. If the denial of a charter petition is reversed by the state board, the state board shall designate, in consultation with the petitioner, either the governing board of the school district or the county board of education in which the charter school is located as the chartering authority.\n(3) A charter school for which a charter is granted by either the county board of education or the state board based on an appeal pursuant to this subdivision shall qualify fully as a charter school for all funding and other purposes of this part.\n(4) A charter school that receives approval of its petition from a county board of education or from the state board on appeal shall be subject to the same requirements concerning geographic location to which it would otherwise be subject if it received approval from the chartering authority to which it originally submitted its petition. A charter petition that is submitted to either a county board of education or to the state board shall meet all otherwise applicable petition requirements, including the identification of the proposed site or sites where the charter school will operate.\n(5) Upon the approval of the petition by the county board of education, the petition or petitioners shall provide written notice of that approval, including a copy of the petition, to the governing board of the school district in which the charter school is located, the department, and the state\nboard.\n(6) If either the county board of education or the state board fails to act on a petition within 180 days of receipt, the decision of the governing board of the school district to deny the petition shall be subject to judicial review.\n(l) (1) Teachers in charter schools shall hold the Commission on Teacher Credentialing certificate, permit, or other document required for the teacher\u2019s certificated assignment. These documents shall be maintained on file at the charter school and are subject to periodic inspection by the chartering authority. A governing body of a direct-funded charter school may use local assignment options authorized in statute and regulations for the purpose of legally assigning certificated teachers, in accordance with all of the requirements of the applicable statutes or regulations in the same manner as a governing board of\na school district. A charter school shall have authority to request an emergency permit or a waiver from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing for individuals in the same manner as a school district.\n(2) By July 1, 2020, all teachers in charter schools shall obtain a certificate of clearance and satisfy the requirements for professional fitness pursuant to Sections 44339, 44340, and 44341.\n(3) The Commission on Teacher Credentialing shall include in the bulletins it issues pursuant to subdivision (k) of Section 44237 to provide notification to local educational agencies of any adverse actions taken against the holders of any commission documents, notice of any adverse actions taken against teachers employed by charter schools, and shall make this bulletin available to all chartering authorities and charter schools in the same manner in which it is made available to local\neducational agencies.\n(m) A charter school shall transmit a copy of its annual, independent financial audit report for the preceding fiscal year, as described in subparagraph (I) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (c), to its chartering authority, the Controller, the county superintendent of schools of the county in which the charter school is sited, unless the county board of education of the county in which the charter school is sited is the chartering authority, and the department by December 15 of each year. This subdivision does not apply if the audit of the charter school is encompassed in the audit of the chartering authority pursuant to Section 41020.\n(n) A charter school may encourage parental involvement, but shall notify the parents and guardians of applicant pupils and currently enrolled pupils that parental involvement is not a requirement for acceptance to, or continued\nenrollment at, the charter school.\n(o) The requirements of this section shall not be waived by the state board pursuant to Section 33050 or any other law."

      "text": "- Share via\n- California Gov. Gavin Newsom has withheld state funding to pay for a pioneering ethnic studies high school graduation requirement that was set to start in the fall.\n- Under state law, school districts do not have to enforce the requirement if funding does not come through.\n- Schools are in limbo about the future of ethnic studies as the course content also is sparking renewed controversy.\nCalifornia became a national pioneer four years ago by passing a law to make ethnic studies a high school graduation requirement. But only months before the policy is to take effect, Gov. Gavin Newsom is withholding state funding \u2014 delaying the mandate as the course comes under renewed fire.\nThe pause \u2014 confirmed by state officials in the governor\u2019s Wednesday budget revision \u2014 has left school districts throughout the state in limbo nearly four years after the launch deadline was set. Beginning this fall, students entering 9th grade would have been the first class required to pass a one-semester class at some point during their high school years.\nBut under the 2021 law, the mandate to reach 5.8 million students does not take effect unless the state provides more money to pay for the course. The funding would cover the cost of materials and the teacher staffing and training that go along with adding a new field of study.\nNewsom\u2019s office, which issued its May revision of next year\u2019s proposed state budget amid a tightening financial outlook, did not respond to questions about why he has not included funding for the ethnic studies requirement that he approved, praising it as an avenue to \u201cteach students about the diverse communities that comprise California.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department of Finance answered on Newsom\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cThe budget doesn\u2019t include funding that would trigger the ethnic studies graduation requirement,\u201d said H.D. Palmer. As to the reason why, \u201cthe short answer is that the state has limited available ongoing resources.\u201d\nAt the onset, $50 million in seed money was allocated statewide, but the law stated an additional unspecified amount would be needed in the future. State officials later set that amount at about $276 million. But several years have passed without state officials budgeting the funding.\nAs California\u2019s more than 1,600 high schools wind down for the year, it is uncertain how many will offer the course in the fall. Some \u2014 including Los Angeles Unified, Santa Monica Unified and Alhambra Unified \u2014 will go forward with ethnic studies no matter what. Some of these districts, including L.A. Unified, already have their own ethnic studies graduation requirement.\nOthers \u2014 including Chino Valley Unified \u2014 will shelve the class until the law forces them to offer it.\nStill others, such as Lynwood Unified, in south L.A. County, say they are deeply concerned about any wavering in the state\u2019s commitment to the subject.\nState funding would be \u201ccritically important for sustainability,\u201d according to a Lynwood district statement. Without it, the school district is going to cancel the course and instead teach units of ethnic studies within other classes.\n\u201cWe remain committed to the principles and purpose behind ethnic studies \u2014 ensuring our students see themselves and others reflected in the curriculum,\u201d Lynwood Supt. Gudiel R. Crosthwaite said. \u201cHowever, like many school districts across California, we are navigating the dual challenge of declining enrollment and insufficient state funding to support new course mandates.\u201d\nRenewed controversy\nThe current political environment complicates the launch of the ethnic studies requirement.\nState officials were moving toward an ethnic studies requirement amid the nation\u2019s racial reckoning after the 2020 murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, and violent attacks on Asian Americans.\nMany ethnic studies supporters believe that anti-racist teachings and exploring the history and perspectives of marginalized groups \u2014 Black and Indigenous people, Asians and Latinos \u2014 are key to bridging misunderstanding among students, reducing racial and ethnic conflict, and motivating teenagers to pursue social justice causes.\nBut not everyone sees ethnic studies the same way. Some religious and political conservatives view the state\u2019s guidelines for ethnic studies as the kind of \u201cwoke\u201d ideologies in education that President Trump has vowed to eliminate as he seeks to do away with diversity, equity and inclusion programming in schools.\nCalifornia\u2019s ethnic studies curriculum guide embraces pro-LGBTQ+ content and speaks of connecting students to \u201ccontemporary social movements that struggle for social justice and an equitable and democratic society, and conceptualize, imagine, and build new possibilities for a post-racist, post-systemic-racism society.\u201d\nWith tensions high over how race, religion and ethnicity are taught in schools, state lawmakers recently explored legislation that would have put strict standards on how ethnic studies could be taught. That bill was supported by 31 legislators and its sponsors expressed particular concern about how ethnic studies teachers are presenting Jews and the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2014 re-igniting long-simmering concerns about the field of study.\nAmid weekend discussions, however, the group shelved the bill \u2014 which dealt only with ethnic studies. Instead, lawmakers unveiled a broader piece of school legislation aimed at ending campus antisemitism while providing greater \u201canti-discrimination protections related to nationality and religion.\u201d\nA hearing on the new bill is set for Wednesday.\nAlthough the bill\u2019s provisions are still being crafted, it would apply to any course or schooling activity \u2014 and include a mechanism for stronger oversight of K-12 ethnic studies, which remains central to the concerns of the bill\u2019s primary sponsors, including Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay).\n\u201cJewish families and children have been made, in many instances, to feel unwelcome or made the targets of hate and discrimination in school \u2014 where they\u2019re supposed to feel safe and supported,\u201d Addis said. \u201cWe want to get all the things in place to get back to what schools are supposed to be doing.\u201d\nTroy Flint, chief communications officer for the California School Boards Assn. said the ethnic studies requirement \u201chas been fraught since its inception, and there have been starts, stumbles and restarts to try and develop a piece of legislation that\u2019s amenable to all the different interest groups. ... And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve reached that point yet.\u201d\n\u201cSchool districts are in a bind,\u201d both in terms of their costs and their academic program, he added, \u201cbecause there\u2019s a possibility a mandate could be implemented, but it\u2019s uncertain.\u201d\n\u2018White supremacists generally think that they\u2019re above people because they have money or good history or they\u2019re related to a king or something. And I\u2019ve seen countless immigrants get deported or accused of something because they\u2019re considered not human or aliens. At the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. What\u2019s the point of having power and not using it for good?\u2019\n\u2014 Jayden Perez, 15, a ninth-grader at Firebaugh High School in Lynwood\nPresident Trump signed an executive order that could be a prelude to a legal challenge of a California law that banned suspension of students for \u201cwillfully defiant\u201d conduct.\nWhat\u2019s happened since the law was approved?\nNewsom signed the ethnic studies graduation requirement into law in 2021, giving districts four years to develop one or more ethnic studies classes, using a menu of materials and topics from the nearly 700-page state model curriculum guide, approved by the State Board of Education.\nThat curriculum guide had been a source of controversy \u2014 leading Newsom to veto an earlier bill for an ethnic studies requirement. After substantial revisions, the final version eliminated course materials that likened the Palestinian cause, in its conflict with Israel, to the struggles of marginalized groups in America \u2014 because critics said it lacked balance or nuance.\nThe revision also toned down what critics characterized as obscure academic jargon and bias against capitalism. More groups were added as potential study topics, including Jewish Americans, Sikhs and Armenians.\nUnder current law, the state\u2019s model curriculum serves as a guide \u2014 not a required set of lessons. School districts are responsible for developing their courses and are free to teach units that reflect their enrollment. Students in Glendale, with its large Armenian American population, for example, could study the Armenian immigrant experience.\n\u2018Understanding one\u2019s background or ethnicity can result in conflict, but I believe that I can build bridges, because many people can understand one another and where they originally came from and what they grew up in. People should be able to talk about this and show our side of the story.\u2019\n\u2014 Gabriel Smith, 14, a ninth-grader at Firebaugh High School in Lynwood\nThis flexibility has allowed academic experts in the field to prepare prepackaged courses and lessons that vary widely to help schools prepare. Some are free to download. Independent Institute, for example, has posted one free curriculum that consciously aims to be less controversial in terms of current political disputes.\nThe group with perhaps the most long-standing ties to the field of ethnic studies in California has created a curriculum called Liberated Ethnic Studies. This curriculum also is free to download, although some of its creators and supporters have worked as school district consultants.\nA portion of the Liberated content guide has worried a coalition of Jewish groups who contend portions of the curriculum veer toward antisemitism. Their concerns have fueled ongoing debate in Sacramento about the need for stricter course standards.\nA federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration\u2019s guidance forbidding DEI efforts in K-12 public schools, impacting California and other states.\n\u2018Ethnic studies should be required because you are learning about the impact of the experiences of different cultures and ethnicities. The most impactful thing I\u2019ve learned is how one\u2019s color or one\u2019s culture can affect the way other people think of them \u2014 how it affects them in their daily lives and how it might affect their workplaces.\u2019\n\u2014 Arianne Moreno, 15, a ninth-grader at Firebaugh High School in Lynwood\nCreators of the Liberated materials had been involved in writing the first version of the state\u2019s model curriculum \u2014 which also was criticized by Jewish groups and legislators. State officials ultimately removed the Liberated academics from involvement in the state\u2019s curriculum guide. And the academics, in turn, disowned the state curriculum guide and created their own materials.\nA leader of the Liberated curriculum effort, Cal State Northridge professor of Chicano and Chicana studies Theresa Monta\u00f1o, said she does not know how may school districts are using their lessons because they can be downloaded for free. She estimated that 70% of the Liberated content is virtually identical to the state\u2019s revised model curriculum.\nShe said concerns about politicized content are overwrought.\n\u201cEthnic studies was born out of a movement to begin to make certain that communities of color have the rightful location in the curriculum,\u201d Monta\u00f1o said.\nShe added that the scholars who put together the Liberated contents are recognized leading experts in an academically rigorous field that has developed over the last 60 years.\nWhat\u2019s happening in the classroom?\nEthnic studies teacher Amber Palma teaches at Firebaugh High School in Lynwood and virtually all of her students are Latino with immigrant backgrounds \u2014 and some degree of current political context is unavoidable.\n\u201cIf the class is about your identity and your place in this American society \u2014 and that is a real social political issue that you are facing in context as we speak \u2014 you can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to not talk about what\u2019s happening,\u201d Palma said. \u201cYou have to address concerns, as you would with any class, with any kids.\u201d\n\u201cGiven our climate and the challenges that our students and their families and their communities are facing, I think we really do need to push the sense of empowerment, a sense of agency,\u201d said Palma, whose district developed its own curriculum.\n\u201cIf done right, ethnic studies is a good thing for all students,\u201d said David Bocarsly, executive director of Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California, a lobbying group whose positions include supporting Israel\u2019s right to exist. \u201cUnfortunately ... we have seen far too many instances of factually inaccurate and antisemitic content entering classrooms,\u201d he said.\nBocarsly said members of his coalition of Jewish groups estimate there are real or potential problems in several dozen school districts among the 1,000 in California, based on issues that have emerged. The extent to which the Liberated curriculum is used in these districts has not been determined.\nAssemblymember Addis is concerned that there could be inappropriate elements of Liberated\u2019s alleged bias affecting \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of school districts up and down the state.\nIn April, the California Department of Education concluded that two Bay Area ethnic studies teachers in the Campbell Union High School District violated California law when they included content related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that was allegedly biased and discriminated against Jewish students.\nHow are school districts responding?\nA winter clash in the Palo Alto, Calif., school district underscores the kinds of debates that have unfolded about the course.\nIn a district with 40% Asian enrollment, some complained the course defined power and privilege in a way that discounted the hard work that resulted in prosperity for many immigrants. Critics also accused district officials of a lack of transparency and of not allowing for meaningful input into course content. Some were concerned that topics would be divisive.\n\u201cAs feared, rancor has ensued,\u201d said Lauren Janov, a critic of the Liberated curriculum and co-founder of Palo Alto Parent Alliance. \u201cFrom the start, the state lost control of ethnic studies.\u201d\nIn January, the Palo Alto board approved its own ethnic studies requirement by a 3-2 vote.\nIn February, Santa Ana Unified shelved three ethnic studies classes as part of a legal settlement reached with a coalition of Jewish groups. The groups had filed a lawsuit alleging that secrecy and antisemitism defined the district\u2019s ethnic studies rollout.\nThe district still offers various other ethnic studies courses and has no plans to reverse policy, regardless of state funding, a district spokesperson said.\nIn San Bernardino County, the Chino Valley Unified school board president also raises cost as an issue but sees the mandate pause as an opportunity to step back from ethnic studies.\n\u201cWe made it clear that the course will not be implemented unless the state mandate goes into effect,\u201d said Sonja Shaw, a pro-Trump Republican who is running for state superintendent of public instruction.\n\u201cMuch of the ethnic studies already being pushed reflects divisive, politically driven ideology that doesn\u2019t unite students; it separates them. ...While kids are falling behind in reading, writing and math, the state continues to push its political agendas onto children,\u201d Shaw said.\nIn Los Angeles Unified, the state\u2019s largest school system, 11 courses can satisfy the district\u2019s requirement, including a broad survey course and more specialized classes, such as African American Literature, American Indian Studies and Exploring Visual Arts through Ethnic Studies."

      "text": "|\nAmended\nIN\nSenate\nMay 17, 2024 |\n| Introduced by Senator Dodd |\nFebruary 16, 2024 |\n(2)Existing law authorizes a charter school petitioner, if the governing board of a school district denies a petition, to submit the petition for the establishment of a charter school to the county board of education on appeal. Separately, existing law authorizes a county board of education to approve a petition for the operation of a countywide charter\nschool, a charter school that operates at one or more sites within the geographic boundaries of the county and that provides instructional services that are not generally provided by a county office of education, only if it finds, in addition to other requirements, that the educational services to be provided by the charter school will offer services to a pupil population that will benefit from those services and that cannot be served as well by a charter school that operates in only one school district in the county.\nThis bill would, if the governing board of a school district denies a petition, prohibit any person from submitting a substantially similar petition to the county board of education as a countywide charter school and would require a county office of education to deny any petition that it finds to be substantially similar to a petition that has been submitted to and denied by the governing board of the school district in which the charter school\nproposes to operate, locate, or place its facilities.\n(3)Existing law requires, at the public hearing at which the county board of education will either grant or deny the charter, the charter school petitioners to have equivalent time and procedures to present evidence and testimony to respond to the county office of education staff recommendations and findings.\nThis bill would also authorize a school district or districts in which a charter school proposes to operate, locate, or place its school facilities, and each school district contiguous to those school districts to provide evidence and testimony at the public hearing on the impact of the charter school on the interests of the entire community in which the charter school is proposing to operate, locate, or place its school facilities, the fiscal impact on the school district by the proposed charter school, and whether the educational services to be provided by the charter school will offer services\nthat cannot be served as well by a charter school that operates in only one school district in the county. The bill would require that each school district that chooses to provide evidence and testimony be provided the equivalent time and procedures to do so as the petitioner.\n(4)\n(ia)The school district is in the first fiscal year after the year the conditions of this clause were met and the school district\u2019s enrollment has declined by an average of at least 0.5 percent for the immediately preceding three fiscal years.\n(ib)The school district is in the second fiscal year after the year the conditions of this clause were met and the school district\u2019s enrollment has declined by an average of at least 1 percent for the immediately preceding three fiscal years.\n(ic)The school district is in the third fiscal year after the year the conditions of this clause were met and the school district\u2019s enrollment has declined by an average of at least 1.5 percent for the immediately preceding three fiscal years.\n(id)The school district is in the fourth fiscal year after the year the conditions of this clause were met and the school district\u2019s enrollment has declined by an average of at least 2 percent for the immediately preceding three fiscal years.\n(ie)The school district is in the fifth fiscal year after the year the conditions of this clause were met and the school district\u2019s enrollment has declined by an average of at least 3 percent for the immediately preceding three fiscal years.\n(iv)The school district has, within the immediately preceding five fiscal years, adopted necessary budgetary solutions including, but not limited to, the consolidation of school sites, to maintain or improve the school district\u2019s fiscal solvency.\n(7)If the governing board of a school district denies a petition, no person shall submit a substantially similar petition to the county board of education for the establishment of a countywide charter school, pursuant to Section 47605.6.\n(a)(1)In addition to the authority provided by Section 47605.5, a county board of education may also approve a petition for the operation of a charter school that operates at one or more sites within the geographic boundaries of the county and that provides instructional services that are not generally provided by a county office of education. A county board of education may approve a countywide charter only if it finds, in addition to the other requirements of this section, that the educational services to be provided by the charter school will offer services to a pupil population that will benefit from those services and that cannot be served as well by a charter school that operates in only one school district in the\ncounty. A petition for the establishment of a countywide charter school pursuant to this subdivision may be circulated throughout the county by any one or more persons seeking to establish the charter school. The petition may be submitted to the county board of education for review after either of the following conditions is met:\n(A)The petition is signed by a number of parents or guardians of pupils residing within the county that is equivalent to at least one-half of the number of pupils that the charter school estimates will enroll in the school for its first year of operation and each of the school districts where the charter school petitioner proposes to operate a facility has received at least 30 days\u2019 notice of the petitioner\u2019s intent to operate a charter school pursuant to this section.\n(B)The petition is signed by a number of teachers that is equivalent to at least one-half of the number of teachers that the charter school estimates will be employed at the school during its first year of operation and each of the school districts where the charter school petitioner proposes to operate a facility has received at least 30 days\u2019 notice of the petitioner\u2019s intent to operate a charter school pursuant to this section.\n(2)An existing public school shall not be converted to a charter school in accordance with this section.\n(3)After receiving approval of its petition, a charter school that proposes to establish operations at additional sites within the geographic boundaries of the county board of education shall notify the school districts where those sites will be located. The charter school shall also request a material revision of its charter by the county board of education that approved its charter and the county board of education shall consider whether to approve those additional locations at an open, public meeting, held no sooner than 30 days following notification of the school districts where the sites will be located. If approved, the location of the approved sites shall be a material revision of the charter school\u2019s approved charter.\n(4)A petition shall include a prominent statement indicating that a signature on the petition means that the parent or guardian is meaningfully interested in having their child or ward attend the charter school, or in the case of a teacher\u2019s signature, means that the teacher is meaningfully interested in teaching at the charter school. The proposed charter shall be attached to the petition.\n(b)No later than 60 days after receiving a petition, in accordance with subdivision (a), the county board of education shall hold a public hearing on the provisions of the charter, at which time the county board of education shall consider the level of support for the petition by teachers, parents or guardians, and the school districts where the charter school petitioner proposes to place school facilities. Following review of the petition and the public hearing, the county board of education shall either grant or deny the charter within 90 days of receipt of the petition. However, this date may be extended by an additional 30 days if both parties agree to the extension. A petition is deemed received by the county board of education for purposes of commencing the timelines described in this\nsubdivision when the petitioner submits a petition, in accordance with subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), to the county office of education. The county board of education shall publish all staff recommendations, including the recommended findings, regarding the petition at least 15 days before the public hearing at which the county board of education will either grant or deny the charter. At the public hearing at which the county board of education will either grant or deny the charter, petitioners shall have equivalent time and procedures to present evidence and testimony to respond to the staff recommendations and findings. Also at the public hearing, a school district or districts in which the charter school proposes to operate, locate, or place its school facilities, and each school district contiguous to those school districts, may provide evidence and testimony on the\nimpact of the charter school on the interests of the entire community in which the charter school is proposing to operate, locate, or place its school facilities, the fiscal impact on the school district by the proposed charter school, and whether the educational services to be provided by the charter school will offer services that cannot be served as well by a charter school that operates in only one school district in the county. Each school district that chooses to provide evidence and testimony shall have the equivalent time and procedures to do so as the petitioner. A county board of education may impose any additional requirements beyond those required by this section that it considers necessary for the sound operation of a countywide charter school. A county board of education may grant a charter for the operation of a charter school under\nthis part only if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice and that the charter school has reasonable justification for why it could not be established by petition to a school district pursuant to Section 47605. The county board of education shall deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school if it finds one or more of the following:\n(1)The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\n(2)The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\n(3)The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision (a).\n(4)The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision (e).\n(5)The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following:\n(A)(i)The educational program of the charter school, designed, among other things, to identify those pupils whom the charter school is attempting to educate, what it means to be an \u201ceducated person\u201d in the 21st century, and how learning best occurs. The goals identified in that program shall include the objective of enabling pupils to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.\n(ii)The annual goals for the charter school for all pupils and for each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to Section 52052, to be achieved in the state priorities, as described in subdivision (d) of Section 52060, that apply for the grade levels served by the charter school, and specific annual actions to achieve those goals. A charter petition may identify additional school priorities, the goals for the school priorities, and the specific annual actions to achieve those goals.\n(iii)If the proposed charter school will enroll high school pupils, the manner in which the charter school will inform parents regarding the transferability of courses to other public high schools. Courses offered by the charter school that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges may be considered to be transferable to other public high schools.\n(iv)If the proposed charter school will enroll high school pupils, information as to the manner in which the charter school will inform parents as to whether each individual course offered by the charter school meets college entrance requirements. Courses approved by the University of California or the California State University as satisfying their prerequisites for admission may be considered as meeting college entrance requirements for purposes of this clause.\n(B)The measurable pupil outcomes identified for use by the charter school. \u201cPupil outcomes,\u201d for purposes of this part, means the extent to which all pupils of the charter school demonstrate that they have attained the skills, knowledge, and aptitudes specified as goals in the charter school\u2019s educational program. Pupil outcomes shall include outcomes that address increases in pupil academic achievement both schoolwide and for all pupil subgroups served by the charter school, as that term is defined in subdivision (a) of Section 52052. The pupil outcomes shall align with the state priorities, as described in subdivision (d) of Section 52060, that apply for the grade levels served by the charter school.\n(C)The method by which pupil progress in meeting those pupil outcomes is to be measured. To the extent practicable, the method for measuring pupil outcomes for state priorities shall be consistent with the way information is reported on a school accountability report card.\n(D)The location of each charter school facility that the petitioner proposes to operate.\n(E)The governance structure of the charter school, including, but not limited to, the process to be followed by the charter school to ensure parental involvement.\n(F)The qualifications to be met by individuals to be employed by the charter school.\n(G)The procedures that the charter school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupils and staff. These procedures shall require all of the following:\n(i)That each employee of the charter school furnish the charter school with a criminal record summary as described in Section 44237.\n(ii)For all schools, the development of a school safety plan, which shall include the safety topics listed in subparagraphs (A) to (K), inclusive, of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 32282. For schools serving pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, the development of a school safety plan shall also include the safety topic listed in subparagraph (L) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 32282.\n(iii)That the school safety plan be reviewed and updated by March 1 of every year by the charter school.\n(H)The means by which the charter school will achieve a balance of racial and ethnic pupils, special education pupils, and English learner pupils, including redesignated fluent English proficient pupils as defined by the evaluation rubrics in Section 52064.5, that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the county board of education to which the charter petition is submitted. Upon renewal, for a charter school not deemed to be a local educational agency for purposes of special education pursuant to Section 47641, the chartering authority may consider the effect of school placements made by the chartering authority in providing a free and appropriate public education as required by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Public Law 101-476), on the balance of pupils with disabilities at the charter school.\n(I)The manner in which annual, independent financial audits shall be conducted, in accordance with regulations established by the state board, and the manner in which audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be resolved.\n(J)The procedures by which pupils can be suspended or expelled from the charter school for disciplinary reasons or otherwise involuntarily removed from the charter school for any reason. These procedures, at a minimum, shall include an explanation of how the charter school will comply with federal and state constitutional procedural and substantive due process requirements that is consistent with all of the following:\n(i)For suspensions of fewer than 10 days, provide oral or written notice of the charges against the pupil and, if the pupil denies the charges, an explanation of the evidence that supports the charges and an opportunity for the pupil to present the pupil\u2019s side of the story.\n(ii)For suspensions of 10 days or more and all other expulsions for disciplinary reasons, both of the following:\n(I)Provide timely, written notice of the charges against the pupil and an explanation of the pupil\u2019s basic rights.\n(II)Provide a hearing adjudicated by a neutral officer within a reasonable number of days at which the pupil has a fair opportunity to present testimony, evidence, and witnesses and confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and at which the pupil has the right to bring legal counsel or an advocate.\n(iii)Contain a clear statement that no pupil shall be involuntarily removed by the charter school for any reason unless the parent or guardian of the pupil has been provided written notice of intent to remove the pupil no less than five schooldays before the effective date of the action.

In the case of a foster child or youth, the written notice shall also be provided to the foster child\u2019s attorney and county social worker. If the pupil is an Indian child, as defined in Section 224.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the written notice shall also be provided to the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker. The written notice shall inform the pupil, the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, the homeless child\u2019s educational rights holder, the foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker of the right to initiate the procedures specified in clause (ii) before the effective date of the action. If the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, the homeless child\u2019s educational rights holder, the foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, or county social worker, or the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker or, if applicable, county social worker initiates the procedures specified in clause (ii), the pupil shall remain enrolled and shall not be removed until the charter school issues a final decision. For purposes of this clause, \u201cinvoluntarily removed\u201d includes disenrolled, dismissed, transferred, or terminated, but does not include suspensions specified in clauses (i) and (ii).\n(iv)A foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker and an Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker shall have the same rights a parent or guardian of a child has to receive a suspension notice, expulsion notice, manifestation determination notice, involuntary transfer notice, and other documents and related information.\n(K)The manner by which staff members of the charter school will be covered by the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or federal social security.\n(L)The procedures to be followed by the charter school and the county board of education to resolve disputes relating to provisions of the charter.\n(M)Admission policy and procedures, consistent with subdivision (e).\n(N)The public school attendance alternatives for pupils residing within the county who choose not to attend the charter school.\n(O)The rights of an employee of the county office of education, upon leaving the employment of the county office of education, to be employed by the charter school, and any rights of return to the county office of education that an employee may have upon leaving the employment of the charter school.\n(P)The procedures to be used if the charter school closes.

      "text": "Please use this document to answer questions before you contact the committee staff. Thank you!\nWhen does the Senate Appropriations Committee meet?\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee meets every Monday at 10 a.m. Our regular \u201chearing season\u201d is typically early April through the May fiscal deadline, and late June through the August fiscal deadline.\nWhat bills are referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee?\nPursuant to Joint Rule 10.5 all bills with a fiscal impact, as determined by Legislative Counsel, are referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee after they have been heard in their respective policy committees. This can include bills that appropriate money, result in substantial expenditure of state money, or result in a substantial loss of revenue to the state. The committee may also request other bills for fiscal reasons despite a determination by Legislative Counsel that a bill is \u201cnon-fiscal.\u201d Examples include bills related to property taxes, worker\u2019s compensation, trial courts, and local employee retirement.\nWhat is Suspense?\nThe Suspense File process has been a part of the Committee Rules since the mid-1980s as a way to consider the fiscal impacts to the state of legislation as a whole. The committee analysis indicates whether a bill\u2019s fiscal impacts meet the criteria for referral to the Suspense File.\nBills that meet the Committee\u2019s Suspense threshold will be placed on the Suspense File after testimony is taken at a regular-order hearing. A vote-only Suspense Hearing will be held prior to the deadlines for fiscal committees to hear and report bills to the Senate Floor. Bills will either move on to the Senate Floor for further consideration or be in held in committee and under submission.\nAt the Suspense File hearing bills are taken up alphabetically by author. There is no public testimony.\nWhat is the fiscal threshold for Suspense?\nGenerally, if the cost of a bill is determined to be $50,000 or more to the General Fund or $150,000 or more to a special fund, the bill meets the criteria for referral to the Suspense File. The fiscal thresholds for suspense apply to the impact on any fund in any fiscal year.\nWhat does 28.8 mean?\nUnder the provisions of Senate Rule 28.8, if the Chair determines that any state costs of a bill are not significant, the measure will be sent directly to the Senate Floor for Second Reading without a hearing in the committee. There is no public analysis prepared for bills that are approved by the Chair pursuant to Senate Rule 28.8, because there is no public hearing.\nDoes the Appropriations Committee have a Consent Calendar?\nNo, not in the traditional sense. A consent calendar is used by many legislative committees to dispense with one or more non-controversial measures that are scheduled for hearing (those with no previous \u201cno\u201d votes and no opposition). Typically, the Chair and Vice-Chair determine which bills to propose for consent, and the committee votes on all of those measures in one batch, without member presentation or public testimony. The Senate Rules (S.R. 28.8, as discussed above), provide the Chair of the Appropriations Committee with unique authority to send bills with low cost and revenue impacts directly to the Senate Floor without a hearing. This is widely viewed as being a substitute for a consent calendar, which we do not have, but there are distinctions.\nIn what order will the bills be heard during a regular order hearing?\nWe hear bills in file order. Bills will be heard in numerical order by author as listed in the Senate Daily File. Once an author is called upon to present a bill, that author may take up any other bills they may have on file for that hearing. There will be no sign-up sheet. As is customary, any members of the committee that have bills on the agenda go at the end of other authors' presentations, or if no other authors are present.\nWhat is \u201cWaive Presentation\u201d and how does it work?\nIf a bill meets the requirements for Suspense authors may request that their bill(s) be referred to the Suspense File without presentation. The request by the author\u2019s office to waive presentation must be submitted in writing to the committee by 5:00 p.m. the Thursday prior to the hearing, and shall note each bill to be waived and the relating clause. (Sample Waive Presentation Letter) The Sergeants will have an agenda with all of the authors waiving presentation posted at the hearing.\nPlease note that if an author chooses to waive presentation there will still be an opportunity for testimony by all interested parties, including members of the public and the Department of Finance, prior to any committee action. Testimony may occur in the absence of the author.\nHow does public testimony work at a regular order bill hearing?\nAnyone desiring to convey support or opposition to a bill on our agenda is welcome to testify before the committee. Testimony shall focus on the fiscal impact of a bill before the committee. When appropriate, the chair may limit individual witness testimony and limit the number of witnesses speaking substantively for or against a bill. The limit will apply equally to both proponents and opponents. There will also be an opportunity for additional witnesses to simply register their support or opposition on a bill for the record.\nWhen is the deadline for submitting support or opposition letters?\nThe fiscal analyses prepared by the Appropriations Committee staff do not list support and opposition, so we do not have a deadline to receive position letters. Any letters submitted to the committee will be retained as part of the committee\u2019s legislative record.\nPlease see Position Letters for more information.\nWhat is the deadline for author\u2019s amendments?\nAmendments are due to the committee the Tuesday prior to a Monday hearing by 12:00 p.m. and should be emailed to the committee assistants (Jennifer.Douglas@sen.ca.gov and Briana.Diaz@sen.ca.gov) and the consultant working on the bill. Please send one complete secure PDF from Legislative Counsel (amendments, digest and in-context). Please also send one scanned copy of the amendments with the author\u2019s signature in the upper right hand corner of the first page, there is no need to provide a hard copy of the amendments to the committee.\nHow can I get a video copy of a committee hearing?\nAll committee hearings are televised. If you would like to request a video copy of a hearing, please contact Senate TV directly at (916) 651-1531. There is a small fee.\nArchived video recordings of our hearings can also be viewed at http://senate.ca.gov/video-on-demand.\nWhen are the analyses available to the public?\nAnalyses are available outside the hearing room (1021 O Street, Room 2200). The analyses may also be found at www.leginfo.ca.gov the day of the hearing.\nHow can I make an appointment to meet with one of the committee consultants?\nPlease call the committee\u2019s direct line at (916) 651-4101 and ask to speak with the specific consultant. You may also email the consultant directly. Each consultant schedules their own meetings. Please see the Committee Staff Assignments.\nWho are the members of your committee and how can I contact them?\nA complete list of the committee members and their contact information can be found under the Member Roster on the home page of our committee website.\nWho is your Republican Consultant?\nPlease contact the Republican Caucus at (916) 651-1501 to find out who in their office is working on a particular bill."

She also served in the Army for seven years as a Medical Laboratory Technician.\nThe big picture: On Oct. 20, 2023, Garcia Duncan reposted a video on X that said it was \u201cthe march of Jordanian people towards the occupied Palestinian border.\u201d\n- The post also included the following hashtags: \u201c#IsraelTerorrist [sic], #PalestinianGenocide, #PalestineGenocide, #Gaza and #Gaza_Genocide.\u201d\nGo deeper: The user that Garcia Duncan reposted was @engelabiha.\n- The profile describes itself in Persian as \u201cA revolutionary student who hates both left and right\u201d and has a picture of the Iranian flag on the profile.\n- The user also links to the Masaf Institute on their profile. The Masaf Institute is an Iranian-backed propaganda arm that has grown in influence in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks.\n- New Lines Magazine wrote an article last year on Iran\u2019s cyberwarfare operations. According to the article, the Masaf Institute literally stands for \u201cStruggle against Zionism, Humanism and Freemasonry.\u201d The organization has sponsored the annual state-backed International Holocaust Cartoon Competition and has developed pro-Iranian regime cyberarmies and engineered coordinated attacks against Iranian dissidents.\nK-12 as a battleground: California\u2019s public elementary and secondary schools have become a battleground in an on-going fight over antisemitism.\n- California state lawmakers are currently debating Assembly Bill 715 \u2013 drafted by Asm. Rick Chavez Zbur (D\u2013Hollywood) and Dawn Addis (D \u2013 Morro Bay) \u2013 which would increase protections against discrimination, including anti-semitism, in California\u2019s K-12 education systems and increase accountability standards for local K-12 educational agencies that engage in antisemitic discrimination."

Bill Essayli, arguing that the Trump administration\u2019s pick to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Southern California is unlawfully occupying his post.\nEssayli, a former Riverside County assemblyman, was appointed by U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi in April, and his term was set to expire in late July unless he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate or a panel of federal judges. But the White House never moved to nominate him to a permanent role, instead opting to use an unprecedented legal maneuver to shift his title to \u201cacting,\u201d extending his term another nine months without any confirmation process.\nThe federal public defender\u2019s office filed a motion seeking to dismiss an indictment against their client and to disqualify Essayli and attorneys working under him \u201cfrom participating in criminal prosecutions in this district.\u201d\nThe defendant, Jaime Ramirez, was indicted on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\nIn a 63-page motion filed in Ramirez\u2019s case, James Anglin Flynn and Ayah A. Sarsour, deputy federal public defenders, argued that the Trump administration circumvented limitations that Congress has imposed on temporary service in key offices, including U.S. attorneys.\nEssayli\u2019s term was supposed to expire on July 29. At that point the White House had not formally nominated him before the U.S. Senate, and local federal judges had taken no action to confirm Essayli, or anyone else, to the position. At the eleventh hour, the White House named Essayli as acting U.S. attorney, allowing him to hold the post for 210 more days without confirmation hearings.\nEssayli \u201cwas not lawfully acting as the United States Attorney in any capacity\u201d on Aug. 13, when the government obtained the indictment against Ramirez, the deputy federal public defenders wrote in their motion. \u201cAnd he has no such lawful authority today.\u201d\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office in L.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment.\nIn their motion, Flynn and Sarsour pointed out that the Trump administration has used similar strategies to keep political allies in power in U.S. attorney\u2019s offices in New Jersey, Nevada, New Mexico and the Northern District of New York. But legal challenges are mounting. Last week, a federal judge ruled that Alina Habba has been illegally occupying her seat in New Jersey since early July, although that order was put on hold pending appeal.\nHabba was nominated for the post earlier this year but did not receive Senate or judicial confirmation. Instead, local federal judges chose Desiree Leigh Grace, a veteran Republican prosecutor within the office, to replace Habba. Bondi responded by firing Grace and naming Habba acting U.S. attorney, sparking confusion over who actually held the post and all but paralyzing the federal criminal court system in the Garden State.\nOn Tuesday, the federal public defender\u2019s office in Nevada filed a motion to do one of two things: dismiss an indictment that acting U.S. Atty. Sigal Chattah brought against one of its clients, or disqualify the U.S. attorney\u2019s office entirely. The 59-page motion specifically challenged Chattah, stating that she is not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney.\nEchoing Judge Matthew W. Brann\u2019s ruling on Habba, the Nevada public defenders argued that Chattah was not first an assistant U.S. attorney, as federal law required when the U.S. attorney seat became vacant.\nThe motion also argues that Chattah was illegally kept in office past the 120-day limit and can\u2019t exercise the powers of the office without Senate confirmation.\n\u201cThe Court should dismiss the indictment; at a minimum, it should disqualify Ms. Chattah from this prosecution, as well as attorneys operating under her direction; and the judges of this district should exercise their authority to appoint a proper interim U.S. Attorney,\u201d the Nevada motion read.\nLast month, in the final days before Chattah\u2019s interim appointment ended, more than 100 retired state and federal judges wrote Nevada\u2019s chief federal district judge to urge him not to appoint her once her term expired. The group said Chattah\u2019s history of \u201cracially charged, violence-tinged, and inflammatory public statements\u201d was disqualifying.\nThe letter called Chattah\u2019s interim appointment \u201ca troubling pattern by the Trump administration of bypassing the Senate\u2019s constitutional role in confirming U.S. Attorneys.\u201d\nAccording to the letter, as of July, Trump had submitted formal nominations for only nine of his administration\u2019s 37 interim appointees.\n\u201cIf this pattern persists, by late fall, more than one-third of the 93 U.S. Attorneys will have evaded Senate review this year alone,\u201d the letter read. \u201cYet, the constitutional role of the Senate is vital regarding the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\u201d\nEach of Trump\u2019s controversial picks has demonstrated fealty to the president. Chattah has long upheld Trump\u2019s lie that he actually won the 2020 election. Habba \u2014 who once served as Trump\u2019s personal attorney and has no prosecutorial experience \u2014 promised to turn New Jersey \u201cred,\u201d breaking with longstanding norms of federal prosecutors eschewing partisan politics. She has also filed criminal charges against two Democratic lawmakers in the state over scuffles with immigration officers at a Newark detention facility.\nSince taking office, Essayli has doggedly pursued Trump\u2019s agenda, championing hard-line immigration enforcement in Southern California, often aping the president\u2019s language verbatim at news conferences. His tenure has sparked discord in the office, with dozens of prosecutors quitting in the face of his belligerent, scream-first management style.\nA Times investigation last month found that his aggressive pursuit of charges against people protesting immigration enforcement in Southern California has led to weak cases being rejected again and again by grand juries. A number of others have been dismissed.\nEven if Trump had formally nominated him to serve a full term as U.S. attorney, it is unlikely he would have ever appeared on the Senate floor. California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, both Democrats, are both opposed to Essayli\u2019s appointment and could have derailed any nomination by withholding what is known as their \u201cblue slip,\u201d or acknowledgment of support for a nominee.\nThe procedural blockades have drawn Trump\u2019s ire, and the president has challenged Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to do away with honoring the blue slip tradition. Grassley has held firm, but Trump has threatened litigation.\nLegal experts called the White House\u2019s move to keep Essayli in office unprecedented last month, and warned it could affect criminal cases.\n\u201cThese laws have never been used, as far as I can see, to bypass the Senate confirmation process or the judicial one,\u201d Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor in L.A. who now serves as a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told The Times last month. \u201cThe most serious consequences are if you\u2019re going to end up with indictments that are not valid because they weren\u2019t signed by a lawful U.S. attorney.\u201d"

      "text": "California is the most successful state and, as our governor rightly reminds detractors, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, with more than $4 trillion in GDP.\nBut maintaining our success requires a relentless focus on the facts in the real world, not a blind leap into meme land.\nThat\u2019s why I was taken aback when Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s vaunted social media team disparaged an announcement from the new CEO of Bed Bath & Beyond that it would not open or operate any stores in California due to anxieties over our state\u2019s business climate. The governor\u2019s team responded to the feedback not with a reasoned argument, but with an extended attack in their new \u201cTrumpian\u201d voice of belittling those who disagree with them. Their message to the CEO (and the 6.1 million other people who viewed the post) was \u201ctake your business elsewhere.\u201d\nGiven that California currently has more than 1 million unemployed residents, this was not the reaction I was expecting \u2014 or that was called for.\nGov. Newsom\u2019s supporters say he is \u201cbreaking the internet\u201d and \u201cowning\u201d Trump. But the governor, and every elected official and leader, also need to own up to the truth. And the truth is that California has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, at 5.5%, and nearly half the nation\u2019s unsheltered homeless people. We have the highest energy and housing costs in the continental United States, and, largely because of these high costs, the highest effective poverty rate in the nation.\nAnd now let me give you the really bad news.\nThese problems are even less likely to be addressed today because of the terribly misaligned incentives being baked into our politics. As Gov. Newsom\u2019s surge in recent polls demonstrates, politicians are being rewarded for resisting, even when such resistance moves beyond taking on the excesses and abuses of the Trump administration and begins disparaging businesses merely for expressing concerns over very real problems of crime, homelessness, and overregulation.\nI was elected mayor of San Jose in 2022 after offering a simple plan for commonsense change: faster and cheaper solutions to homelessness, an increase in police hiring, and tying our elected officials\u2019 pay to performance. These seemed like pretty radical ideas to some \u2014 although not to the majority of San Joseans demanding action.\nBy tuning out the political noise and focusing on the basic issues that residents care about the most, San Jose has nearly completed over 2,000 new safe and decent shelter units for homeless people in less than two years \u2014 and we are shrinking our unsheltered homeless population. We are clearing encampments and requiring that people come indoors if there is shelter available. And, under our new \u201cResponsibility to Shelter\u201d ordinance, if someone repeatedly refuses shelter when shelter is available, they could be charged with trespassing.\nCrime is going down \u2014 in part because we helped convince Californians to embrace Proposition 36 to end a cycle of theft without consequence, sending the message that serious criminal activity, like repeated retail thefts, would carry consequences.\nBut we are just one city. We, and every California city, would be doing better if Sacramento was doing more. Instead of spending so much energy attacking his opponents, the governor and his team should be addressing the high cost of energy, helping hard-pressed families make ends meet and keeping them and their employers from fleeing our state. They should be addressing concerns over public safety by fully implementing the will of the voters on Proposition 36 by building enough treatment beds to ensure it doesn\u2019t become a self-fulfilling prophecy for the opposition.\nWhile the governor should be thanked for taking concrete steps on permitting reform, signing a bill to reduce the use of the California Environmental Quality Act to stop infill housing, he should use that real-world achievement as a model, not a one-off. By doing even more to address the high cost of housing construction and complicated building codes, the governor would help address both our homelessness crisis and our punishingly high cost of living.\nInstead of modeling themselves after a governor focused on these important issues, our politicians are instead watching our governor \u201csucceed\u201d by making a ton of noise online, even sometimes at the expense of our state\u2019s reputation. It might be a winning strategy for his presidential campaign, but it\u2019s a losing one for improving the lives of Californians. And now even more politicians will try to get ahead with online antics rather than sensible policies.\nCertainly, the governor should be praised \u2014 and rewarded politically \u2014 for standing up to protect vulnerable Californians whose constitutional rights are under attack. And on more than one occasion, he has done just that \u2014 brilliantly and courageously.\nBut \u201cbreaking the internet\u201d doesn\u2019t solve real-world problems \u2014 quite the opposite. More often than not, it\u2019s just political theater that serves to excuse inaction and ineffective policies.\nSo if we really want change, we need to break this pattern of equating spicy online attacks with actual, successful attacks on our very serious problems.\nBecause the way we win the fight for a better California is by solving problems in the real world, not by stooping to Donald Trump's level online.\nMatt Mahan is the mayor of San Jose."

      "text": "|\nGovernmental Accomplishments\n- Curb worked with William French Smith (future U.S. Attorney General) and Theodore (Ted) Olson (future U.S. Solicitor General) to defend the lawsuit brought by Governor Brown challenging the authority of a Lt. Governor in the absence of the Governor. In a landmark decision, the California Supreme Court ruled in Curb's favor with a decision that the Lt. Governor not only has the power, but the responsibility of Governor when the Governor is out of state. Curb ultimately acted approximately one year as Governor. This decision was particularly important to California because a previous Lt. Governor (Glenn Anderson) was unsure of his responsibilities in the absence of Governor Pat Brown (Jerry Brown's father) during the Watts Riots in 1965. The failure to act promptly by the then Acting Governor (Lt. Governor Glenn Anderson) was cited by the McCone Commission and also by others as a factor in the destruction and burning of Watts which has had a lasting impact on California, and the rest of our country. The National Conference of Lt. Governors which is comprised of the governors of both political parties elected Curb to be their chairman because of the impact that this decision could have on other states.\n- While Mike Curb was Lt. Governor and during the time he was Acting Governor, he made 431 appointments.\n- Curb signed in excess of 30 bills and proclamations as Acting Governor.\n- During the first two years of his term, Curb served as Acting Governor between 25-30 percent of the time and served as Acting Governor for approximately one year during the term.\n- Curb signed the Rob-A-Home/Go-To-Jail bill as Acting Governor with the support of both houses of the State Legislature. John Van de Kamp and Kenneth Hahn attended the conference when the bill was signed, to show their approval.\n- Curb signed the bill that prohibits trial courts from ordering any prosecution witness or victim in any sexual assault case, including child molestation cases, to submit to a psychiatric or psychological examination to test his or her credibility.\n- As Acting Governor, Curb created the California Agriculture Commission that successfully dealt with a number of key issues including bringing to the public's attention important facts such as spraying for the Med-fly and measures to protect workers from being sprayed while working.\n- During the gas-line crisis, Curb signed a proclamation as Acting Governor suspending certain ARB regulations to allow for a temporary increase in lead content in gasoline to ease the gas lines. This concept was supported by a majority of the legislators from both parties.\n- As Acting Governor, Curb created the California Commission on Food and Nutrition to help solve the problem of malnutrition.\n- As Acting Governor, Curb created the California Commission on Citizen Participation in Government to seek the best-qualified people for government positions. A number of people were appointed by the Governor based on recommendations by this Commission.\n- Curb formed the Water Task Force that did the complicated job of determining the ultimate cost of the water issue that was on the ballot in 1982. The Thru-Delta proposal that the task force put together in great detail appears to be the compromise proposal that will ultimately be adopted by the current administration and the Legislature.\n- Curb chaired the Economic Development Commission and discussed public issues relating to economic development, regulatory reform and utility rates.\n- Curb constantly defended Proposition 13 which limited government's rights to increase property taxes and was one of the first supporters of the proposition when it was on the ballot.\n- As Acting Governor, Curb held the first press conference to launch the State Spending Limitation action that the voters later approved.\n- Curb took similar action to launch the Crime Victims Bill of Rights that was also later approved by the Voters.\n- Curb helped turn the Commission of the Californias into a stronger committee to strengthen relationships with Mexico, and Curb put forth proposals to properly handle undocumented guest workers.\n- Curb worked with county supervisor Harvey Milk to defeat a statewide initiative that would have denied gay schoolteachers their civil rights. While Curb was Acting Governor, Curb supported Governor Brown's executive order prohibiting discrimination against gays.\n- Curb appointed Judge Armand Arabian to the second appellate district of the California Court of Appeals paving the way for Governor George Deukmajian to elevate him to the California Supreme Court.\n- As Acting Governor, Curb signed emergency orders and state-of-emergency proclamations or otherwise assisted in approximately ten emergencies in various counties while Jerry Brown was out of state. The emergencies included fires, floods, mudslides, earthquakes and storms.\n- Curb was elected national chairman of all of the nation's Lt. Governors from both political parties. He discussed in California various options pertaining to the Lt. Governor's office that had been tried in other states. These options include the possibility of the office being part-time, being eliminated in favor of the Senate president or Assembly speaker, the possibility of the Governor and the Lt. Governor being a ticket and defining the other opportunities for this office. In order to set an example for other office holders, Curb reduced the budget of his office during his term as Lt. Governor and instituted a policy of reimbursing the state for time spent out of state on non-state business. When Curb was appointed national Co-Chairman of President Reagan's national presidential campaign and chairman of the Republican convention program, Curb reimbursed the state for the time he was out-of-state. Curb also nominated and elected the first woman, Carol Hallett, to be elected as a legislative leader and nominated and elected the first Hispanic chairman of the California Republic Party, Tirso del Junco.\nGovernmental History\n|\nDuring the 1970s, Curb also began venturing into public service. In 1976, he served as co-chair of the Ronald Reagan California Campaign for President and later was co-chair of President Gerald Ford's California campaign. In November 1978, Curb was elected California's lieutenant governor, the same year that Democrat Jerry Brown was elected governor. During his 1979 to 1983 term, Curb, served as acting governor for about one year, guiding the state during disastrous floods, fires and a threatened prison guard strike. Also, during Curb's term, in a landmark decision, the California Supreme Court ruled in Curb's favor with a decision that the Lt. Governor not only has the power, but the responsibility of Governor when the Governor is out of state. He also served on the University of California Board of Regents and the California State University Board of Trustees. Curb also served as President of the California State Senate and Chairman of the Economic Development Commission. Curb received a presidential appointment to the United States Trade Negotiations Committee and the USO Board. In recent years, Curb has received an appointment to the Tennessee Gubernatorial Economic Board and Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam appointed Curb to be Chairman of the Tennessee Film Entertainment and Music Commission.\nIn 1980, Curb served as the national Co-Chairman of President Reagan's successful presidential campaign and Chairman of the convention program in Detroit. In 1982, Curb was elected chair of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors. Then in 1983, at President Reagan's request, Curb served as Chairman of the National Finance Committee during the president's re-election campaign, responsible for raising more than $100 million. In 1984, Curb was appointed Chairman of the Presidential Trust during the Reagan-Bush re-election cycle. In honor of his mentor, Curb played a major role in the Reagan Centennial by sponsoring the rebuilding of the Victory Room at the Ronald Reagan Museum and Library in California. Linda and Mike Curb are founders of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Washington, DC. where the Curb Media Center is located.

      "text": "(1) Existing law creates the Metropolitan Transportation Commission as a local area planning agency for the 9-county San Francisco Bay area with comprehensive regional transportation planning and other related responsibilities. Existing law creates various transit districts located in the San Francisco Bay area, with specified powers and duties relating to providing public transit services.\nThis bill would establish the Transportation Revenue Measure District with jurisdiction extending throughout the boundaries of the Counties of Alameda and Contra Costa and the City and County of San Francisco and would require the district to be governed by the same board that governs the commission, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize a retail transactions and use tax\napplicable to the entire district to be imposed by the board of the district or by a qualified voter initiative for a duration of 10 to 15 years, inclusive, and generally in an amount of 0.5%, subject to voter approval at the November 3, 2026, statewide general election. After allocations are made for various administrative expenses, the bill would require an unspecified portion of the proceeds of the tax to be allocated by the commission to initiatives included in a specified commission plan and to the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, commonly known as Caltrain, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and other specified transit agencies for operating expenses, and would require the remaining proceeds to be subvened directly to the counties comprising the district for public transportation expenses, as prescribed.\nBy adding to the duties of local officials\nwith respect to elections procedures for this bill on behalf of the district, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n(2) Existing law requires the commission to develop regional transit service objectives, develop performance measures of efficiency and effectiveness, specify uniform data requirements to assess public transit service benefits and costs, and formulate procedures for establishing regional transportation priorities in the allocation of funds for transportation purposes.\nThis bill would require the commission, upon the approval of a measure by the voters of the Transportation Revenue Measure District, to engage in a comprehensive independent third-party financial efficiency review of the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, Caltrain, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and would require the independent\nthird party contracted by the commission for this purpose to prepare a final report of the review. After one of these transit operators receives the final report, the bill would require the transit operator, as a condition of receiving those funds, to finalize an implementation plan that describes, among other things, efficiency measures the transit operator plans to take and to submit the implementation plan to the commission, as specified. The bill would also require those transit operators, as a condition of receiving those funds, to comply with a maintenance of effort requirement, as specified.\nThe bill would require each transit operator that receives a distribution of funds directly from the commission to comply with the policies and programs adopted by the commission through its Regional Network Management framework, as provided.\nThis bill would require the commission to submit a report to the Legislature on or\nbefore March 31, 2026, on its forecast of the impacts to ridership on the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, Caltrain, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency from planned transportation projects and strategies included in its adopted regional transportation plan.\nBy adding to the duties of the commission, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n(3) The Bay Area County Traffic and Transportation Funding Act authorizes the formation of county transportation authorities in each of the 9 bay area counties, and provides for the imposition of a retail transaction and use tax of either 1/2 of 1% or 1%, subject to voter approval, with revenues to be used for various transportation purposes.\nThis bill would instead provide that a retail transaction and use tax imposed under those provisions in the County of San Mateo or the City and County of San Francisco may be imposed in 1/8 of 1% increments up to 1%.\n(4) This bill would declare that its provisions are severable.\n(5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill\ncontains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.\n(6) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute."

      "text": "44225.\nThe commission shall do all of the following:(a) Establish professional standards, assessments, and examinations for entry and advancement in the education profession. While the Legislature recognizes that the commission will exercise its prerogative to determine those requirements, it is the intent of the Legislature that standards, assessments, and examinations be developed and implemented for the following:\n(1) (A) The preliminary teaching credential, to be granted upon possession of a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education, completion of an accredited program of professional preparation, and either successful passage of an examination or assessment\nthat has been adopted or approved by the commission in the subject or subjects appropriate to the grade level to be taught, to include college-level reading, writing, and mathematics skills, or completion of an accredited program of subject matter preparation and successful passage of the basic skills proficiency test as provided for in Article 4 (commencing with Section 44250). The commission shall uniformly consider the results of the basic skills proficiency test in conjunction with other pertinent information about the qualifications of each candidate for a preliminary credential, and may award the credential on the basis of the overall performance of a candidate as measured by several criteria of professional competence if the candidate meets minimum standards set by the commission on each criterion. Upon application by a regionally accredited institution of higher education, the commission may categorically grant credit to coursework completed in an accredited program of professional preparation, as\nspecified by this paragraph, by undergraduates of that institution, if the commission finds there are adequate assurances of the quality of necessary undergraduate instruction in the liberal arts and in the subject area or areas to be taught.\n(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for single subject teaching credentials, the baccalaureate degree shall not be in the subject of professional education.\n(2) The professional teaching credential, to be granted upon successful passage of a state examination or assessment in the subject or subjects appropriate to the grade level to be taught, to include college-level basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills, and completion of a period of beginning teacher support that includes assessments of ability to teach subject matter to pupils, ability to work well with pupils, classroom management, and instructional skills. A candidate who\nsuccessfully passes the examination or assessment pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deemed to have passed the state examination or assessment in the subject or subjects to be taught pursuant to this paragraph.\n(b) (1) Reduce and streamline the credential system to ensure teacher competence in the subject field or fields, while allowing greater flexibility in staffing local schools. The commission shall award the following types of credentials to applicants whose preparation and competence satisfy its standards:\n(A) Basic teaching credentials for teaching in kindergarten, or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, in public schools in the state.\n(B) Credentials for teaching adult education classes and vocational education classes.\n(C) Credentials for teaching specialties, including, but not necessarily limited to, bilingual education, early childhood education, and special education. The commission may grant credentials to any candidate who concurrently meets the commission\u2019s standards of preparation and competence for the preliminary basic teaching credential and the preliminary specialty credential.\n(D) Credentials for school services, for positions including, but not necessarily limited to, administrators, school counselors, speech-language therapists, audiologists, school psychologists, library media teachers, supervisors of attendance, and school nurses.\n(2) The commission may establish standards and requirements for\npreliminary and professional credentials of each type.\n(c) Review and, if necessary, revise the code of ethics for the teaching profession.\n(d) Establish standards for the issuance and renewal of credentials, certificates, and permits. In setting standards, the commission shall seek to ensure, through its credentialing of teachers, that public school teachers satisfy all of the following criteria:\n(1) Are academically talented.\n(2) Are knowledgeable of the subjects to be taught in the classroom.\n(3) Are creative and energetic.\n(4) Have the human skills to motivate and inspire pupils to achieve their goals.\n(5) Have the sensitivity to foster self-esteem in pupils through recognition that each pupil has their own goals, talents, and levels of development.\n(6) Are willing to relate the educational process and their instructional strategies to meet the needs of pupils.\n(7) Are able to work effectively with and motivate pupils from a variety of ethnic, socioeconomic, cultural, academic, and linguistic backgrounds.\n(8) Have an understanding of principles and laws related to educational equity, and the equitable practice of the profession of education among all pupils regardless of their ethnicity, race, gender, age, religious background, primary language, or disabling condition.\n(e) Determine the\nscope and authorization of credentials to ensure competence in teaching and other educational services, and establish sanctions for the misuse of credentials and the misassignment of credentialholders. The commission may grant an added or supplementary authorization to a credentialholder who has met the requirements and standards of the commission for the added or supplementary authorization. The commission shall exempt the holder of a teaching credential obtained before January 1, 1974, who adds an authorization by successfully completing a commission-approved subject matter examination, from the requirements of subdivision (e) of Section 44259 and Section 44261.\n(f) Collect, compile, and disseminate information regarding exemplary practices in supporting and assessing beginning teachers.\n(g) Establish alternative methods for entry into the teaching profession, and into other\ncertificated roles in the schools, by persons in varying circumstances, including persons who have been educated outside of California, provided that each applicant satisfies all of the requirements established by the commission. One alternative method shall be the successful completion of at least two years of classroom instruction under a district intern certificate pursuant to Article 7.5 (commencing with Section 44325). In establishing alternative methods for entry into the teaching profession, the commission shall develop strategies to encourage classroom aides to become credentialed teachers.\n(h) Adopt a framework and general standards for the accreditation of preparation programs for teachers and other certificated educators pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 44320).\n(i) Appoint classroom teachers, school administrators, other school services personnel,\nrepresentatives of the public, and public or private higher education representatives to one or more standing committees, which shall be given authority to recommend to the commission standards relating to examinations, performance assessments, program accreditation, and licensing. The commission shall establish criteria for membership on those committees, and shall determine the terms of committee members. Appointments to standing committees by the commission shall reflect, to the extent feasible, the ethnic and cultural diversity of the California public schools.\n(j) Consult with classroom teachers, faculty members from institutions of higher education that maintain accredited programs of professional preparation for teachers, administrators or other school services personnel, and other experts to aid in the development of examinations and assessments, and to study the impact of examinations and assessments on the teaching profession. To\nincrease the fairness of its certification decisions, the commission may uniformly consider the results of tests, subtests, and assessments in conjunction with each other, and in conjunction with other pertinent information about the qualifications of each candidate. The commission may award credentials on the basis of average overall performances by candidates on several criteria of professional competence if the candidate meets minimum standards set by the commission on each criterion.\n(k) Adopt standards for all examinations and assessments that shall ensure that all prospective teachers demonstrate an understanding of the history and cultures of the major ethnic populations of this state and of teaching strategies for the acquisition of English language skills by non-English-speaking pupils.\n(l) Adopt training for educators to address hate or unlawful discrimination against the six most targeted groups in the state. To determine the six most targeted groups in the state, the commission shall refer to the subcategory bias motivations with the highest number of events, as provided in Table 1 of the annual \u201cHate Crime in California\u201d publication by the Attorney General, which reports hate crime data required to be submitted to the Attorney General by law enforcement agencies pursuant to Section 13023 of the Penal Code.\n(m) Ensure all state-funded teacher training programs comply with the law, with enforcement from the department.\n(l)\n(n) Determine the terms of credentials, certificates, and permits, except that no credential, certificate, or permit shall be valid for more than five years from the date of issuance. This article shall govern the issuance of any credential, certificate, or permit, except as follows:\n(1) A credential, certificate, or permit shall remain in force as long as it is valid and continues to be valid under the laws and regulations that were in effect when it was issued.\n(2) The commission shall grant teaching credentials pursuant to statutes that were in effect on December 31, 1988, to candidates who, before the effective date of regulations to implement subdivision (a), were in the process of meeting the requirements\nfor teaching credentials that were in effect on December 31, 1988, except that neither enrollment as an undergraduate student nor receipt of a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education before the effective date of the regulations shall, by itself, exempt a candidate from the requirements of subdivision (a). Enrollment in a preparation program for teachers before the effective date of the regulations shall not exempt a candidate from the requirements of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), if the preliminary credential of the candidate was granted after the effective date of the regulations.\n(m)\n(o) (1) Review\nrequests from school districts, county offices of education, private schools, and postsecondary institutions for the waiver of one or more of the provisions of this chapter or other provisions governing the preparation or licensing of educators. The commission may grant a waiver upon finding that the professional preparation equivalent to that prescribed under the provision or provisions to be waived will be, or has been, completed by the credential candidate or candidates affected, or that a waiver is necessary to accomplish any of the following:\n(A) Give a local educational agency one semester or less to address unanticipated, immediate, short-term shortages of fully qualified educators by assigning a teacher who holds a basic teaching credential to teach outside of the teacher\u2019s credential authorization, with the teacher\u2019s consent.\n(B) Provide credential candidates additional\ntime to complete a credential requirement.\n(C) Allow local school districts or schools to implement an education reform or restructuring plan.\n(D) Temporarily exempt from a specified credential requirement small, geographically isolated regions with a severely limited ability to develop personnel.\n(E) Provide other temporary exemptions when deemed appropriate by the commission.\n(2) No provision in this chapter shall be waived under Sections 33050 and 33051, after June 30, 1994, by the state board.\n(n)\n(p) It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission develop models for voluntary use by California colleges and universities that do not have these models in place, to assist in the screening of applications for admission to teacher education programs. The models shall give emphasis to the following qualifications of the applicants: academic talent, knowledge of subjects to be taught, basic academic skills, creativity, experience in working with children and adolescents, ability to motivate and inspire pupils, and willingness to relate education to pupils with a wide variety of cultural, ethnic, and academic backgrounds. The commission may continue to administer the state basic skills proficiency test, in order (1) to use the results of this test in awarding preliminary teaching credentials and emergency permits, and (2) to enable colleges and universities to use this test in conjunction with other appropriate sources of information in teacher preparation admission decisions. However, it\nis the intent of the Legislature that applicants for admission to teacher preparation programs shall not be denied admission solely on the basis of state basic skills proficiency test results. The commission may recover the costs of administering and developing the test by charging examinees a fee for taking the test.\n(o)\n(q) It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission encourage colleges and universities to design and implement, by August 1, 1990, concentrated internship programs for persons who have attained a baccalaureate degree in the field in which they intend to teach. Those programs would be targeted at subject area shortages, would substitute for\nconventional training programs, and would include a full summer session of college-level coursework, a one-year internship, or the equivalent, a seminar throughout the internship, and a summer session following the internship. Educator preparation through internship programs shall be subject to Article 10 (commencing with Section 44370).\n(p)\n(r) Grant a field placement certificate to a candidate who has been admitted to an accredited program of professional preparation, and who must complete a supervised practicum in public elementary or secondary schools as a condition for completion of the program. The commission shall establish standards for the issuance of field\nplacement certificates.\n(q)\n(s) Propose appropriate rules and regulations to implement Chapter 1355 of the Statutes of 1988.\n(r)\n(t) Adopt subject matter assessments for teaching credentials after developing those assessments jointly with the Superintendent."

Existing law requires the Instructional Quality Commission to, among other things, recommend curriculum frameworks to the state board and develop criteria for evaluating instructional materials.\nThis bill would require the state board to, on or before January 1, 2028, develop and adopt academically rigorous content standards for ethnic studies instruction in high school. The bill would require the commission, on or before January 1, 2028, to review and recommend to the state board curriculum frameworks and instructional materials for ethnic studies instruction in high school, as specified. The bill would require the state board\nto provide the commission with evaluation criteria to use in providing its review and recommendations. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact subsequent legislation to establish an advisory committee with a majority of the advisory committee\u2019s members being experts in African American studies, Asian American and Pacific Islander studies, Native American studies, and Latino and Chicanx studies, to provide input to the state board on proposed content standards and to the commission on proposed curriculum frameworks and instructional materials for ethnic studies instruction in high school.\nExisting law requires a pupil to complete designated coursework while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school. These graduation requirements include, commencing for pupils graduating in the 2029\u201330 school year, the completion of a one-semester course in ethnic studies meeting specified requirements. Under\nexisting law, the requirement to complete an ethnic studies course may be fulfilled by the completion of, among others, a course based on the model curriculum developed by the Instructional Quality Commission, an ethnic studies course taught as part of a course that has been approved as meeting the A\u2013G requirements of the University of California and the California State University, or a locally developed ethnic studies course approved by the governing board of a school district or the governing body of a charter school. Existing law requires the curriculum, instruction, and instructional materials for these ethnic studies courses to meet specified requirements, including that they not reflect or promote any bias, bigotry, or discrimination against any person or group of persons on the basis of certain characteristics. Existing law makes these provisions relating to ethnic studies courses operative only upon an appropriation of funds by the Legislature for purposes of these provisions.\nThis bill would require the curriculum, instruction, and instructional materials for any high school ethnic studies course, including ethnic studies courses meeting high school graduation requirements, to meet the above-described requirements, and would require the curriculum, instruction, and instructional materials for all high school ethnic studies courses to additionally, among other things, foster multicultural respect and understanding and focus on the domestic experience and stories of historically marginalized peoples in American society. To the extent that the bill would impose new duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\nThe bill would require a school district, county office of education, or charter school to provide, on or before June 30, 2026, the State Department of Education with a copy of all curricula, instruction, and instructional materials in ethnic studies\nthat schools offer or plan to offer to pupils in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, and the adoption calendar for curricula, instruction, and instructional materials in ethnic studies proposed for adoption by the governing board or body of the local educational agency for instruction to these pupils. The bill would require a local educational agency that does not have an ethnic studies course in place for its pupils in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, on or before June 30, 2026, to provide the department with a copy of all curricula, instruction, and instructional materials in ethnic studies that its schools seek to adopt at least 60 days before being first presented at a public meeting of the governing board or body of the local educational agency for instruction to these pupils. The bill would require the department to post the information received pursuant to these requirements on its internet website. To the extent that the bill would impose new duties on local educational agencies, it would impose a\nstate-mandated local program.\nThe bill would require the department to monitor compliance with the requirements of this bill as part of its annual compliance monitoring of state and federal programs and to provide a report to the relevant policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature summarizing the data collected through compliance monitoring, as specified.\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

      "text": "Existing law, the Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA), an initiative measure, authorizes a person who obtains a state license under AUMA to engage in commercial adult-use cannabis activity pursuant to that license and applicable local ordinances. The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), among other things, consolidates the licensure and regulation of commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis activities.\nExisting law, the Cannabis Tax Law, imposes an excise tax upon purchasers of cannabis or cannabis products sold in this state at the rate of 15% of the gross receipts of any retail sale by a cannabis retailer, and, as enacted by AUMA, imposed a cultivation tax on all harvested cannabis that entered the commercial market, as specified. Chapter 56 of the Statutes of 2022 (AB 195) amended\nAUMA to, among other things, discontinue the imposition of the cultivation tax on July 1, 2022.

      "text": "Transcript: Gov. Wes Moore on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Aug. 24, 2025\nThe following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.\nGOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?\nGOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement\nGOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?\nGOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.\nGOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--\nGOV. MOORE: --And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?\nGOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.\nGOV. MOORE: Yeah.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.\nGOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.\nGOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?\nGOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.\nGOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?\nGOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.\nGOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?\nGOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?\nGOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are?\nGOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?\nGOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?\nGOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.\nGOV. MOORE: Yes we are.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.\nGOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

The proposed charter shall be attached to the petition.\n(4) After receiving approval of its petition, a charter school that proposes to expand operations to one or more additional sites or grade levels shall request a material revision to its charter and shall notify the chartering authority of those additional\nlocations or grade levels. The chartering authority shall consider whether to approve those additional locations or grade levels at an open, public meeting. If the additional locations or grade levels are approved pursuant to the standards and criteria described in subdivision (c), they shall be a material revision to the charter school\u2019s charter.\n(5) (A) A charter school that established one site outside the boundaries of the school district, but within the county in which that school district is located before January 1, 2020, may continue to operate that site until the charter school submits a request for the renewal of its charter petition. To continue operating the site, the charter school shall do either of the following:\n(i) First, before submitting the\nrequest for the renewal of the charter petition, obtain approval in writing from the school district where the site is operating.\n(ii) Submit a request for the renewal of the charter petition pursuant to Section 47607 to the school district in which the charter school is located.\n(B) If a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency is issued in accordance with the federal Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 5121 et seq.) for an area in which a charter schoolsite is located and operating, the charter school, for not more than five years, may relocate that site outside the area subject to the Presidential declaration if the charter school first obtains the written approval of the school district where the site is being\nrelocated to.\n(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a charter school was relocated from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2019, inclusive, due to a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency in accordance with the federal Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 5121 et seq.), that charter school shall be allowed to return to its original campus location in perpetuity.\n(D) (i) A charter school in operation and providing educational services to pupils before October 1, 2019, located on a federally recognized California Indian reservation or rancheria or operated by a federally recognized California Indian tribe shall be exempt from the geographic restrictions of paragraph (1) and subparagraph (A) of this\nparagraph and the geographic restrictions of subdivision (a) of Section 47605.1.\n(ii) The exemption to the geographic restrictions of subdivision (a) of Section 47605.1 in clause (i) does not apply to nonclassroom-based charter schools operating pursuant to Section 47612.5.\n(E) The department shall regard as a continuing charter school for all purposes a charter school that was granted approval of its\npetition, that was providing educational services to pupils before October 1, 2019, and is authorized by a different chartering authority due to changes to this paragraph that took effect January 1, 2020. This paragraph shall be implemented only to the extent it does not conflict with federal law. In order to prevent any potential conflict with federal law, this paragraph does not apply to covered programs as identified in Section 8101(11) of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801) to the extent the affected charter school is the restructured portion of a divided charter school pursuant to Section 47654.\n(6) Commencing January 1, 2003, a petition to establish a charter school shall not be approved to serve pupils in a grade level that is not served by the school district of the governing\nboard considering the petition, unless the petition proposes to serve pupils in all of the grade levels served by that school district.\n(b) No later than 60 days after receiving a petition, in accordance with subdivision (a), the governing board of the school district shall hold a public hearing on the provisions of the charter, at which time the governing board of the school district shall consider the level of support for the petition by teachers employed by the school district, other employees of the school district, and parents. Following review of the petition and the public hearing, the governing board of the school district shall either grant or deny the charter within 90 days of receipt of the petition, provided, however, that the date may be extended by an additional 30 days if both parties agree to the extension. A petition is deemed\nreceived by the governing board of the school district for purposes of commencing the timelines described in this subdivision on the day the petitioner submits a petition to the district office, along with a signed certification that the petitioner deems the petition to be complete. The governing board of the school district shall publish all staff recommendations, including the recommended findings and, if applicable, the certification from the county superintendent of schools prepared pursuant to paragraph (8) of subdivision (c), regarding the petition at least 15 days before the public hearing at which the governing board of the school district will either grant or deny the charter. At the public hearing at which the governing board of the school district will either grant or deny the charter, petitioners shall have equivalent time and procedures to present evidence and testimony to respond to\nthe staff recommendations and findings.\n(c) In reviewing petitions for the establishment of charter schools pursuant to this section, the chartering authority shall be guided by the intent of the Legislature that charter schools are and should become an integral part of the California educational system and that the establishment of charter schools should be encouraged. The governing board of the school district shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice and with the interests of the community in which the school is proposing to locate. The governing board of the school district shall consider the academic needs of the pupils the school proposes to serve. The governing board of the school district shall not deny a\npetition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings, specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings:\n(1) The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\n(2) The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\n(3) The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision (a).\n(4) The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision (e).\n(5) The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following:\n(A) (i) The educational program of the charter school, designed, among other things, to identify those whom the charter school is attempting to educate, what it means to be an \u201ceducated person\u201d in the 21st century, and how learning best occurs. The goals identified in that program shall include the objective of enabling\npupils to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.\n(ii) The annual goals for the charter school for all pupils and for each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to Section 52052, to be achieved in the state priorities, as described in subdivision (d) of Section 52060, that apply for the grade levels served, and specific annual actions to achieve those goals. A charter petition may identify additional school priorities, the goals for the school priorities, and the specific annual actions to achieve those goals.\n(iii) If the proposed charter school will serve high school pupils, the manner in which the charter school will inform parents about the transferability of courses to other public high schools and the eligibility of courses to meet college entrance\nrequirements. Courses offered by the charter school that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges may be considered transferable and courses approved by the University of California or the California State University as creditable under the \u201cA to G\u201d admissions criteria may be considered to meet college entrance requirements.\n(B) The measurable pupil outcomes identified for use by the charter school. \u201cPupil outcomes,\u201d for purposes of this part, means the extent to which all pupils of the charter school demonstrate that they have attained the skills, knowledge, and attitudes specified as goals in the charter school\u2019s educational program. Pupil outcomes shall include outcomes that address increases in pupil academic achievement both schoolwide and for all pupil subgroups served by the charter school, as\nthat term is defined in subdivision (a) of Section 52052. The pupil outcomes shall align with the state priorities, as described in subdivision (d) of Section 52060, that apply for the grade levels served by the charter school.\n(C) The method by which pupil progress in meeting those pupil outcomes is to be measured. To the extent practicable, the method for measuring pupil outcomes for state priorities shall be consistent with the way information is reported on a school accountability report card.\n(D) The governance structure of the charter school, including, but not limited to, the process to be followed by the charter school to ensure parental involvement.\n(E) The qualifications to be met by individuals to be employed by\nthe charter school.\n(F) The procedures that the charter school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupils and staff. These procedures shall require all of the following:\n(i) That each employee of the charter school furnish the charter school with a criminal record summary as described in Section 44237.\n(ii) For all schools, the development of a school safety plan, which shall include the safety topics listed in subparagraphs (A) to (M), inclusive, of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 32282. For schools serving pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, the development of a school safety plan shall also include the safety topic listed in subparagraph (N) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of\nSection 32282.\n(iii) That the school safety plan be reviewed and updated by March 1 of every year by the charter school.\n(G) The means by which the charter school will achieve a balance of racial and ethnic pupils, special education pupils, and English learner pupils, including redesignated fluent English proficient pupils, as defined by the evaluation rubrics in Section 52064.5, that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the school district to which the charter petition is submitted. Upon renewal, for a charter school not deemed to be a local educational agency for purposes of special education pursuant to Section 47641, the chartering authority may consider the effect of school placements made by the chartering authority in\nproviding a free and appropriate public education as required by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Public Law 101-476), on the balance of pupils with disabilities at the charter school.\n(H) Admission policies and procedures, consistent with subdivision (e).\n(I) The procedures by which pupils can be suspended or expelled from the charter school for disciplinary reasons or otherwise\ninvoluntarily removed from the charter school for any reason. These procedures, at a minimum, shall include an explanation of how the charter school will comply with federal and state constitutional procedural and substantive due process requirements that are consistent with all of the following:\n(i) For suspensions of fewer than 10 days, provide oral or written notice of the charges against the pupil and, if the pupil denies the charges, an explanation of the evidence that supports the charges and an opportunity for the pupil to present the pupil\u2019s side of the story.\n(ii) For suspensions of 10 days or more and all other expulsions for disciplinary reasons, both of the following:\n(I) Provide timely,\nwritten notice of the charges against the pupil and an explanation of the pupil\u2019s basic rights.\n(II) Provide a hearing adjudicated by a neutral officer within a reasonable number of days at which the pupil has a fair opportunity to present testimony, evidence, and witnesses and confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and at which the pupil has the right to bring legal counsel or an advocate.\n(iii) Contain a clear statement that no pupil shall be involuntarily removed by the charter school for any reason unless the parent or guardian of the pupil has been provided written notice of intent to remove the pupil no less than five schooldays before the effective date of the action. The written notice shall be in the native language of the pupil or the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, or, if\nthe pupil is a homeless child or youth, or a foster child or youth, in the native language of the homeless or foster child\u2019s educational rights holder. In the case of a foster child or youth, the written notice shall also be provided to the foster child\u2019s attorney and county social worker. If the pupil is an Indian child, as defined in Section 224.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the written notice shall also be provided to the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker. The written notice shall inform the pupil, the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, the homeless child\u2019s educational rights holder, the foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker, or the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker of the right to initiate the procedures specified in clause (ii) before the effective date of the action.\nIf the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian, the homeless child\u2019s educational rights holder, the foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, or county social worker, or the Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker or, if applicable, county social worker initiates the procedures specified in clause (ii), the pupil shall remain enrolled and shall not be removed until the charter school issues a final decision. For purposes of this clause, \u201cinvoluntarily removed\u201d includes disenrolled, dismissed, transferred, or terminated, but does not include suspensions specified in clauses (i) and (ii).\n(iv) A foster child\u2019s educational rights holder, attorney, and county social worker and an Indian child\u2019s tribal social worker and, if applicable, county social worker shall have the same rights a parent or guardian of a child has to receive a suspension notice, expulsion\nnotice, manifestation determination notice, involuntary transfer notice, and other documents and related information.\n(J) The manner by which staff members of the charter schools will be covered by the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or federal social security.\n(K) The public school attendance alternatives for pupils residing within the school district who choose not to attend charter schools.\n(L) The rights of an employee of the school district upon leaving the employment of the school district to work in a charter school, and of any rights of return to the school district after employment at a charter school.\n(M) The\nprocedures to be followed by the charter school and the chartering authority to resolve disputes relating to provisions of the charter.\n(N) The procedures to be used if the charter school closes. The procedures shall ensure a final audit of the charter school to determine the disposition of all assets and liabilities of the charter school, including plans for disposing of any net assets and for the\nmaintenance and transfer of pupil records.\n(6) The petition does not contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter 10.7 (commencing with Section 3540) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code.\n(7) The charter school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is proposing to locate. Analysis of this finding shall include consideration of the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. A written factual finding under this paragraph shall detail specific facts and circumstances that analyze and consider the following factors:\n(A) The extent to which the proposed charter school would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings.\n(B) Whether the proposed charter school would duplicate a program currently offered within the school district and the existing program has sufficient capacity for the pupils proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the charter school intends to locate.\n(8) The school district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. A school district satisfies this paragraph if it has a qualified interim certification pursuant to Section 42131 and the county superintendent of schools, in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, certifies that\napproving the charter school would result in the school district having a negative interim certification pursuant to Section 42131, has a negative interim certification pursuant to Section 42131, or is under state receivership. Charter schools proposed in a school district satisfying one of these conditions shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption of denial.\n(d) (1) Charter schools shall meet all statewide standards and conduct the pupil assessments required pursuant to Section 60605 and any other statewide standards authorized in statute or pupil assessments applicable to pupils in noncharter public schools.\n(2) Charter schools shall, on a regular basis, consult with their parents, legal guardians, and\nteachers regarding the charter school\u2019s educational programs.\n(e) (1) In addition to any other requirement imposed under this part, a charter school shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations, shall not charge tuition, and shall not discriminate against a pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Section 220. Except as provided in paragraph (2), admission to a charter school shall not be determined according to the place of residence of the pupil, or of that pupil\u2019s parent or legal guardian, within this state, except that an existing public school converting partially or entirely to a charter school under this part shall adopt and maintain a policy giving admission preference to pupils who reside within the former attendance area of that public\nschool.\n(2) (A) A charter school shall admit all pupils who wish to attend the charter school.\n(B) If the number of pupils who wish to attend the charter school exceeds the charter school\u2019s capacity, attendance, except for existing pupils of the charter school, shall be determined by a public random drawing. Preference shall be extended to pupils currently attending the charter school and pupils who reside in the school district except as provided for in Section 47614.5. Preferences, including, but not limited to, siblings of pupils admitted or attending the charter school and children of the charter school\u2019s teachers, staff, and founders identified in the initial charter, may also be permitted by the chartering authority on an individual charter school\nbasis. Priority order for any preference shall be determined in the charter petition in accordance with all of the following:\n(i) Each type of preference shall be approved by the chartering authority at a public hearing.\n(ii) Preferences shall be consistent with federal law, the California Constitution, and Section 200.\n(iii) Preferences shall not result in limiting enrollment access for pupils with disabilities, academically low-achieving pupils, English learners, neglected or delinquent pupils, homeless pupils, or pupils who are economically disadvantaged, as determined by eligibility for any free or reduced-price meal program, foster youth, or pupils based on nationality, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.\n(iv) In accordance with Section 49011, preferences shall not require mandatory parental volunteer hours as a criterion for admission or continued enrollment.\n(C) In the event of a drawing, the chartering authority shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the growth of the charter school and shall not take any action to impede the charter school from expanding enrollment to meet pupil demand.\n(3) If a pupil is expelled or leaves the charter school without graduating or completing the school year for any reason, the charter school shall notify the superintendent of the school district of the pupil\u2019s last known address within 30 days, and shall, upon request, provide that school district with a copy of the cumulative\nrecord of the pupil, including report cards or a transcript of grades, and health information. If the pupil is subsequently expelled or leaves the school district without graduating or completing the school year for any reason, the school district shall provide this information to the charter school within 30 days if the charter school demonstrates that the pupil had been enrolled in the charter school. This paragraph applies only to pupils subject to compulsory full-time education pursuant to Section 48200.\n(4) (A) A charter school shall not discourage a pupil from enrolling or seeking to enroll in the charter school for any reason, including, but not limited to, academic performance of the pupil or because the pupil exhibits any of the characteristics described in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2).\n(B) A charter school shall not request a pupil\u2019s records or require a parent, guardian, or pupil to submit the pupil\u2019s records to the charter school before enrollment.\n(C) A charter school shall not encourage a pupil currently attending the charter school to disenroll from the charter school or transfer to another school for any reason, including, but not limited to, academic performance of the pupil or because the pupil exhibits any of the characteristics described in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2). This subparagraph shall not apply to actions taken by a charter school pursuant to the procedures described in subparagraph (I) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (c).\n(D) The department shall develop a\nnotice of the requirements of this paragraph. This notice shall be posted on a charter school\u2019s internet website. A charter school shall provide a parent or guardian, or a pupil if the pupil is 18 years of age or older, a copy of this notice at all of the following times:\n(i) When a parent, guardian, or pupil inquires about enrollment.\n(ii) Before conducting an enrollment lottery.\n(iii) Before disenrollment of a pupil.\n(E) (i) A person who suspects that a charter school has violated this paragraph may file a complaint with the chartering authority.\n(ii) The department shall develop\na template to be used for filing complaints pursuant to clause (i).\n(5) Notwithstanding any other law, a charter school in operation as of July 1, 2019, that operates in partnership with the California National Guard may dismiss a pupil from the charter school for failing to maintain the minimum standards of conduct required by the Military Department.\n(6) A charter school shall, at a governing body meeting, obtain the approval of the governing body of the charter school for any\ncontract that would cause the charter school to compensate an individual contractor more than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in a fiscal year.\n(f) The governing board of a school district shall not require an employee of the school district to be employed in a charter school.\n(g) The governing board of a school district shall not require a pupil enrolled in the school district to attend a charter school.\n(h) The governing board of a school district shall require that the petitioner or petitioners provide information regarding the proposed operation and potential effects of the charter school, including, but not limited to, the facilities to be used by the charter school, the manner in which\nadministrative services of the charter school are to be provided, and potential civil liability effects, if any, upon the charter school and upon the school district.

The state\u2019s legislative agenda also features a contentious debate over a proposed redistricting measure (Prop\u202f50) that has attracted significant political and financial backing from both sides. These policy moves are unfolding amid broader concerns about California\u2019s fiscal health, education reforms, and the political influence of major donors and interest groups.",
