  "description": "CNN's senior data analyst Harry Enten exposed Donald Trump's approval ratings on the programme after the Epstein scandal",
  "content": "CNN was brought to a screeching halt for breaking news concerning US president Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as bombshell statistics were exposed. The network\u2019s senior data analyst Harry Enten was on the scene to confirm Trump\u2019s approval ratings, showing new statistics on-screen. The stats showed that in August 2017, Trump had just 37% approval, which soared to 45% in July 2025 and dropped just slightly to 44% in August 2025. In addition, Google searches for Epstein have fallen 89% in comparison to three weeks prior \u2013 hinting that the American public have seemingly \u201cmoved on\u201d from worrying about the Epstein files.\n\nEnten said on the show: \u201cI would just say this, Donald Trump has some of the best political instincts of any politician I\u2019ve seen and on this particular issue, you see it full well and clear because he has been saying, \u2018You know what, the [Epstein files] are not an issue\u2019 and it turns out a lot of the American public actually seem to agree with him.\u201d He added: \u201cTrump\u2019s approval is still well within that margin of error here of 44% and you compare that to where he was in his first term at this point, he was 37%.\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s seven points higher, very much in a different political universe now. It\u2019s significantly higher in terms of his overall approval rating than he was at this point in his first term\u2026 \u201cSo no, he hasn\u2019t lost any of that base and when it comes to that centre of the electorate, he\u2019s basically holding on there and his overall approval rating, 44%, is pretty darn gosh good for him considering where he was at this point in term number one.\u201d Trump claimed on July 29 that he removed Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago resort after learning that he was hiring his female spa workers \u2013 including a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre.",
