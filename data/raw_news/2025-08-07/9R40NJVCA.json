  "description": "Orpyx Launches Sensory Insole Program to Combat >$80B Annual Cost of Diabetic Foot Complications",
  "content": "Orpyx\u00ae Medical Technologies Inc., a leader in sensor-based remote monitoring, today announced the launch of its next-generation sensory insole program, a proactive, scalable solution to prevent the most costly and preventable consequences of diabetes. In the US alone, one in every three diabetes-related healthcare dollars goes toward managing foot-related complications, representing over $80 billion annually (Armstrong et al., Journal of Foot and Ankle Research, 2020).\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250806137783/en/\n\nThe Orpyx\u00ae Sensory Insoles are embedded with proprietary sensors that continuously track plantar pressure, foot temperature, step count, and wear time \u2014 physiological indicators that signal early deterioration in foot health. Designed for effortless patient use, the insoles function for up to six months without charging and sync with an intuitive mobile app and home hub that uploads data directly and securely to the Orpyx cloud.\n\n\u201cThis new platform combines durable wearable technology and behavioral support to enable healthcare providers to intervene early before complications escalate,\u201d said Dr. Breanne Everett, CEO and founder of Orpyx. \u201cOur goal is to help people stay healthy, avoid hospitalizations, and maintain control over their health. This launch is a key milestone as we scale across government and commercial value-based care markets, supporting high-risk individuals while delivering meaningful value for healthcare systems and payers who are under increasing pressure to improve outcomes while managing costs more effectively.\u201d\n\nEach program participant is paired with a dedicated Orpyx nurse who delivers personalized coaching, adherence support, and wellness checks, bridging the gap between medical appointments to help ensure continuity of care. This model supports both better outcomes and operational scalability for chronic disease management programs.\n\nThe Orpyx technology is clinically validated and economically proven in multiple peer-reviewed publications. In a randomized controlled trial, individuals who wore an earlier-generation Orpyx insoles for 4.5+ hours daily experienced an 86% reduction in foot re-ulceration (Abbott et al., Lancet Digital Health, 2019). A separate cost-effectiveness study reported an 84% reduction in ulcer occurrence within three months, along with a 70% decrease in total projected costs (Najafi et al., Wound Care Management, 2018).\n\n\u201cThis product launch represents a significant advancement in orthotic technology. Clinicians can now medically monitor or intervene with patients living with chronic foot conditions that put them at risk for serious complications\u201d, said Dr. Daniel Ferreras, DPM, FAPWCA, AAWC. \u201cBy combining clinically validated technology with personalized support, we\u2019re providing patients the tools they need to stay healthier, avoid hospitalization, and maintain their independence.\u201d\n\nFoot complications are a leading cause of diabetes-related hospitalization, amputation, and long-term disability, which are largely preventable with early detection and intervention. The Orpyx Sensory Insole program is built to support value-based care models for health systems, ACOs, and payers focused on managing this high-risk, high-cost population living with diabetes.\n\nOrpyx\u00ae is a health technology company transforming the prevention of diabetic foot complications through its patented sensor-enabled smart insole system and integrated remote care program. Built to detect early warning signs and prompt timely intervention, the Orpyx solution helps improve adherence, reduce total costs, and preserve mobility and quality of life. The company partners with VA Medical Centers, health systems, and payers across North America to deliver clinically validated outcomes and cost savings at scale.",
