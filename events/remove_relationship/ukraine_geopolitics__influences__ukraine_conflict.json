      "fundamental_analysis": "The Trump–Putin talks, viewed through a multi‑year macro lens, should be framed by invariant structural anchors—real‑rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity gaps, BoP/net external position, and plausible policy reaction functions across the U.S., Europe, and Russia—that will constrain how regimes price geopolitical risk. Ukraine’s exclusion from the Alaska talks and Zelenskyy’s warnings that Moscow is preparing new offensives underscore regime fragility and raise the risk that any settlement could be struck without Kyiv’s buy‑in, lifting risk premia for European assets and energy supply chains (XNWVTO01Z). The White House discussions about potentially inviting Zelenskyy to Alaska—still not decided in the reporting—would constitute a regime turning point if a trilateral format becomes feasible, while European leaders insist that Ukraine must participate and that borders cannot be altered without Kyiv (XNWVTO01Z). Regime‑level shifts will hinge on concrete catalysts—formal Zelenskyy invitation, binding ceasefire language, and credible European guarantees on borders—against a backdrop of the invariant macro anchors that limit or enable shifting risk pricing (XNWVTO01Z).\n\nRegime map (framework only): Regime 1—Inclusive, credible ceasefire with Ukraine at the table; Regime 2—Stalled/fragile process with Ukraine sidelined or concessions; Regime 3—Escalation risk if new offensives threaten credibility. Catalysts and thresholds: Regime 1 requires formal invitation to Zelenskyy, binding ceasefire language, and credible European guarantees on borders; Regime 2 arises if invitation is withheld or ceasefire is non‑binding; Regime 3 signals emerge with renewed offensives or breakdown of sanctions coordination. Transition conditions: the materialization of invitation, binding language, and credible European commitments would push the regime toward Regime 1, whereas lack of progress would keep the regime in Regime 2 or tilt toward Regime 3. Transmission channels to prices operate as the regime shifts: sovereign risk premia, energy and commodity price volatility, FX and equity volatility, and cross‑border sanction dynamics respond to the evolving diplomatic backdrop, shaping market pricing through a stepwise, testable chain rather than a single paragraph claim.\n\nBase case (mid) over the multi‑year horizon: Ukraine remains central to the process; de‑escalation is fragile and conditional on verifiable steps, with risk premia staying elevated versus pre‑crisis baselines (XNWVTO01Z). Upside if Regime 1 materializes: binding ceasefire terms and credible Ukrainian participation would likely compress risk premia and stabilize energy markets (XNWVTO01Z). Downside if Regime 2/3 dominates: sidelining Ukraine and ambiguous terms could widen risk premia and amplify volatility in equities, currencies, and energy (XNWVTO01Z). Watchlist: the invitation status for Zelenskyy, the bindingness and enforcement of any ceasefire language, and European commitments on borders (XNWVTO01Z). Confidence is medium and conditional on concrete milestones—invitation progress, verifiable ceasefire terms, and credible European assurances—materializing and being observed in diplomacy (XNWVTO01Z).",
