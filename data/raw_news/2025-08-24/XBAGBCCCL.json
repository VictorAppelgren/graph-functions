  "title": "Nation\u2019s 2 largest teachers unions funneled nearly $50M to left-wing groups, watchdog report says",
  "description": "Teachers unions NEA and AFT spent $43.5 million on left-wing political causes since 2022 despite declining membership, according to new Defending Ed report.",
  "content": "Amid a trend of declining membership since the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union dues, the nation\u2019s two largest teachers\u2019 unions have poured tens of millions into left-wing causes, a new report finds from a conservative watchdog group.\n\nThe national nonprofit group, Defending Ed, released a report this week after combing through the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers' contributions to left-wing and far-left groups. The nonprofit found that the two unions spent a combined $43.5 million since 2022 to help fund state and federal political action committees and other ideologically left-wing entities, such as D.C. think tanks.\n\n\"It is clear that the teachers unions\u2019 priorities are advancing far-left politics and radical social justice issues, not the education of children,\" Defending Ed researcher Rhyen Staley told Fox News Digital. \"This is a slap in the face to families and teachers who want to focus on helping students improve their reading and math skills. It is time that Congress acts to stop this obscene redistribution of public monies to advance left-wing identity politics.\"\n\nNEW GROUP OFFERS TEACHERS A WAY TO ESCAPE THE PROGRESSIVE UNION 'MONOPOLY'\n\nLeft-wing philanthropic behemoths like the Tides Network, New Venture Fund, Sixteen-Thirty Fund, and Future Forward, the last of which was the main Super PAC supporting Kamla Harris' 2024 presidential run after former President Joe Biden dropped out, all received a combined nearly $1.5 million from the unions, according to the report.\n\nThe unions also forked over significant amounts of cash for groups that focus on supporting left-wing candidates for public office, such as the Democratic Governors Association, Democrat's House Majority and Senate Majority PACs.\n\nOther groups they have donated to include major left-wing think tanks like the Center for American Progress and its 501(c)(4) arm, which received close to a million dollars since 2022 from the two unions.\n\nAaron Withe, an expert on public-sector unions, pointed out that the National Education Association spends less than 10% of its budget on what he called \"representational activities,\" while, at the same time, the union spends 38% of its budget on contributions to left-leaning groups, lobbying and political gifts.\n\n\"You\u2019d think in light of the decline in union membership in recent years, that they\u2019d start providing value to members that outweighs the cost of membership,\" Withe told Fox News Digital. \"Instead, they are appeasing the radical base of union members by advocating for men in women\u2019s sports, transitioning minors, antisemitism and other radical ideological stances.\"\n\nHe added that this is just \"the tip of the iceberg\" too \"when you consider that there are thousands of statewide and city and county teachers unions that are mostly funding the same causes.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNeither the National Education Association, nor the American Federation of Teachers, responded to Fox News Digital's repeated requests for comment.",

      "text": "Key facts about former President Joe Biden: What to know\nJoe Biden served as the 46th president of the United States. Prior to his presidency, he served in the U.S. Senate and as vice president in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. During his own presidency, the Biden-Harris administration prioritized issues such as climate change, Medicaid, infrastructure and LGBTQ+ initiatives.\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, Biden ran as the original Democratic nominee. Following his first presidential debate with Donald Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed his vice president at the time, Kamala Harris, for president. Harris lost the election, with many voters voicing concerns over immigration, border security and the economy as reasons for casting their votes for the Republican presidential candidate, President Donald Trump.\nAfter leaving office, Biden has largely kept to himself but has remained a topic of conversation in politics, mainly regarding his health, which was questioned throughout his presidency. Investigations and allegations of a cover-up regarding the truth of Biden\u2019s physical and mental well-being during his time in the White House have been brought forward.\nBiden\u2019s family has also been in the spotlight over the years, facing both tragedy and controversy. He lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and his daughter, Naomi Biden, in a car accident in 1972. He later married Jill Biden in 1977. In 2015, his son Beau Biden died after a battle with brain cancer.\nBiden\u2019s other son, Hunter Biden, has faced personal battles with addiction over the years and has been at the center of numerous legal investigations, including over the contents of his laptop. Before leaving office, Biden pardoned Hunter for crimes he \"has committed or may have committed.\u201d"

      "text": "The National Education Association (NEA) tried scrubbing its radical 2025 handbook from the internet after I leaked its contents on X, but I saved a copy of their 434-page manifesto. This document, meant to guide America\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, exposes a radical agenda: erasing Jews from the Holocaust, blaming \"white supremacy culture\" for systemic racism, pushing illegal racial quotas, calling for \"educational reparations,\" and attacking homeschooling while ignoring their own failing schools.\nThe NEA, armed with a unique 1906 federal charter, has become a money-laundering operation for the Democratic Party, funneling over 99% of its 2022 political contributions to Democrats. Its president, Becky Pringle, an at-large Democratic National Committee member, engages in histrionics to rally this partisan machine.\nThe \"Stopping Teachers Unions from Damaging Education Needs Today (STUDENT) Act,\" introduced last week by Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative Scott Fitzgerald, would gut this cartel by banning lobbying, political activity, and racial quotas, mandating transparency, and stopping strikes that shutter schools. Congress must pass this bill to leverage the NEA\u2019s charter, force it back to education, or make it beg to lose its special privilege.\nNEA TEACHERS UNION MEMBER WAS TOLD FIGHTING TRUMP MORE CRUCIAL THAN READING AND WRITING: REPORT\nThe NEA\u2019s handbook is a blueprint for extremism, not education. It downplays the Holocaust\u2019s targeting of Jews, framing it as a generic tragedy while emphasizing other groups, effectively erasing Jewish suffering from history. It declares that \"educators must acknowledge the existence of white supremacy culture as a primary root cause of institutional racism, structural racism, and white privilege,\" vowing to push \"strategies fostering the eradication of institutional racism and white privilege perpetuated by white supremacy culture.\" It demands school districts provide training in \"cultural competence, implicit bias, restorative practices, and racial justice.\" Worse, it calls for illegal racial quotas, stating, \"The National Education Association believes that at every phase of governance and on all decision-making levels of the Association there should be minority participation at least proportionate to the identified ethnic-minority population of that geographic level.\" These quotas prioritize identity over merit, dividing teachers and distracting from student needs. The handbook even attacks homeschooling, claiming \"home schooling programs based on parental choice cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience\"\u2014ironic, given that only about a quarter of public school eighth graders are proficient in math despite $20,000 per student in annual spending.\nThe NEA\u2019s federal charter, a privilege no other union enjoys, was meant to advance teaching and learning, not fuel a partisan agenda. With nearly $400 million in annual revenue from teacher dues, the NEA bankrolls Democratic campaigns while neglecting classrooms. Pringle\u2019s DNC ties and histrionic convention speeches ensure the NEA serves progressive politics, not educators. The union\u2019s 2025 convention in Portland, Oregon, doubled down this month. Ashlie Crosson, the 2025 NEA Teacher of the Year, declared teaching \"deeply political.\" Resolutions read like a DNC war plan: one pledged thousands to smear President Trump as a \"fascist,\" misspelling \"fascism\" as \"facism.\" Another committed over $200,000 to evade a Supreme Court ruling allowing parents to opt out of gender ideology instruction. The NEA also vowed to fight Trump\u2019s immigration and education policies. In 2019, it rejected a resolution to \"rededicate itself to the pursuit of increased student learning in every public school in America.\"\nThe NEA\u2019s attempt to erase its handbook after my X leak shows they fear transparency. That 434-page document, which I preserved, reveals an organization obsessed with divisive ideologies and political power, not education. Over a million families have fled public schools since 2019 for charters, private schools, or homeschooling, driven by the NEA\u2019s focus on politics. Its attacks on parental choice and accountability, coupled with embarrassing academic outcomes, prove it\u2019s failing students and teachers alike.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe STUDENT Act is a kill shot. Unlike revoking the NEA\u2019s charter \u2013 a symbolic jab that wouldn\u2019t stop its antics \u2013 this bill dismantles its power. It bans lobbying and political activity, choking off its Democratic pipeline. It ends racial quotas, ensuring merit-based leadership. It mandates annual reports to Congress, exposing Pringle\u2019s $400 million war chest. It prohibits strikes, keeping schools open for nearly 50 million students. It scraps the NEA\u2019s D.C. property tax exemption and requires informed consent for dues, ending automatic deductions.\nA charter repeal would bruise the NEA\u2019s ego, but leave its operations intact. The STUDENT Act cuts deeper. The union might beg Congress to ditch its charter to escape these shackles.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe teachers unions are destroying the public school system. Test scores are tanking, teacher morale is at historic lows, and families are fleeing. The NEA\u2019s radical handbook \u2013 erasing Jews from history, pushing racial quotas, and attacking homeschooling \u2013 shows it\u2019s part of the problem. The STUDENT Act can force the NEA to refocus on students or fade away. Congress must pass this bill, leverage the charter, and end the NEA\u2019s reign as a partisan cartel.\nThe handbook is out there for the world to see, NEA. You can run, but you can\u2019t hide."

      "text": "A new program from the Teacher Freedom Alliance gives teachers the option to opt out of unions.\n\"The Freedom Foundation has been helping government employees opt out of their unions on a national scale since 2020,\" Aaron Withe, CEO of the Freedom Foundation and president of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"Since then we\u2019ve seen the largest decline in union membership in U.S. history, most notably, the NEA has lost over 200,000 members,\" Withe continued. \"However, the teachers' unions still have a monopoly on professional services, such as liability coverage, curriculums, and professional development credits.\"\nA 2022 report featured in The Lion said that the country's top four public unions, which include the National Education Association (NEA) and American Federation of Teachers, have lost over 200,000 members since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 Janus v. AFSCME decision.\nNEA TEACHERS UNION MEMBER WAS TOLD FIGHTING TRUMP MORE CRUCIAL THAN READING AND WRITING: REPORT\nThe antidote to this problem, Withe said, is offering resources to teachers that give them the benefits of a teachers' union, without the politics.\nOfficially launching the teachers' arm in March, the Teacher Freedom Alliance is a separate entity supported by the Freedom Foundation.\nThe resources include dues-free membership for teachers and education staff, $2,000,000 liability insurance for \"protection and peace of mind,\" alternative curricula specially made for various subjects and grades, and professional development hours and credits.\n\"The Teacher Freedom Alliance is the alternative to the teachers' unions,\" Withe said. \"We assist teachers in their mission to develop free, moral and upright citizens. We are doing this by providing professional services.\"\nSince the launch in March, Withe claimed they have had over 2,500 teachers become members.\nTEACHERS UNION REVEALS TRUE COLORS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AT ANNUAL CONVENTION\nAnd recently, the group hosted a conference for over 400 teachers in Washington, DC.\nThe group said that are \"changing the culture of education\" by advancing \"traditional education values\" instead of politics.\nPromotional materials for the organization state the group is \"activating historically silent educators\u2014giving them the confidence & community to stand for what\u2019s right,\" and \"providing superior resources compared to the NEA & AFT.\"\nStacy Adair is one of the original teachers that joined the Teacher Freedom Alliance. Adair has been teaching for twenty years as an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher and works with students in kindergarten through 5th grade at a school in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nShe told Fox News Digital in a statement that she can't say enough good things about the organization.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The Teacher Freedom Alliance is exactly what I\u2019ve been hoping for without even knowing it,\" Adair said. \"Common sense and conservative teachers finally have a voice, and the TFA is offering us professional development, camaraderie, and support. I can't keep quiet about it; I'm constantly spreading the word in my district, my town, and my state!\""

  "argos_summary": "A new report from the conservative watchdog Defending Ed finds that the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers have spent $43.5\u202fmillion since 2022 supporting left\u2011wing political action committees, think tanks and progressive causes, even as union membership declines. Critics argue the unions prioritize radical social\u2011justice agendas over classroom improvement, while the Teacher Freedom Alliance promotes a non\u2011political alternative for teachers. The report highlights the tension between unions\u2019 political influence and their stated mission to advance education, and calls for congressional action to curb their partisan spending.",
