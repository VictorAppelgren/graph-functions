      "feedback": "The draft correctly flags Ford as an income-heavy, cyclical play with EV-margin risks, but to reach world-class quality you need a tighter, first-principles, multi-year framework that ties fundamentals to pricing. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: (1) introduce a formal horizon and regimes anchored in first principles—three regimes for Ford over multi‑years (Regime A: EV losses persist, ROIC below WACC, cyclicality dominates; Regime B: EV segment achieves consistent profitability, ROIC ≈ or > WACC, capex reverts to stable growth; Regime C: macro/ tariff shocks trigger a demand downturn). State transition conditions and causal channels: policy/tariffs and interest-rate regime drive EV demand and pricing power, which feed EBITDA margins, FCF, and ROIC, in turn pricing the stock. (2) codify invariant anchors with explicit numbers from sources: ROIC near 10% in recent quarters and EV EBIT losses (22PL3Q360); dividend yield ≈5% and forward P/E ≈10x as a base-case valuation anchor (65UUBU0OR); use ROIC vs. WACC logic to judge value creation (W2622L6WW). (3) sharpen the causal chain from capital allocation to market pricing: EV capex cadence (up to $50B through 2026 with pauses of up to $12B) affects margins; cash flow discipline supports dividends; any sustained ROIC > WACC would re-rate multiple expansion beyond the income yield (22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW). (4) quantify the base case and sensitivities: decompose total return into dividend yield (about 5%) plus potential growth from EV profitability and modest multiple expansion; specify plausible annual ranges under Regimes A–B and the risk of contraction under Regime C (65UUBU0OR; 22PL3Q360). (5) articulate catalysts and invalidation points explicitly: quarterly EV EBIT/margin inflection; sustained deleveraging or reacceleration of capex; tariff clarity or escalation; a macro recession; and if ROIC fails to exceed inferred cost of capital, invalidate a bull rerate (W2622L6WW; 22PL3Q360). (6) address conflicts and coverage gaps: harmonize the bull-case emphasis on EV ramp with the consensus of underwhelming long-run upside; ensure all factual claims tie to a cited ID; and explicitly note the practical discrepancy between 17% YTD gain in 2025 from one source and the long-run underperformance narrative in others (22PL3Q360; 65UUBU0OR). (7) tighten the structure and format to meet horizon/style: a single, concise base-case narrative followed by explicit regimes, triggers, and watch items, with each factual claim linked to one of the three IDs; and trim nonessential commentary to keep it within a multi-year, structural analysis footprint.",
