      "summary": "U.S. stocks closed higher with the Nasdaq up 1.0% and the S&P 500 up 0.5%, while the Dow slipped 0.1%. Alphabet surged 9.1% after a federal judge ruled it would not be forced to divest key assets, and Apple gained 3.8% as the ruling allows it to preload Google Search on iPhones. A drop in U.S. job openings to a ten‑month low bolstered expectations of a Fed rate cut, and gold stocks rose 1.8% as the metal hit a new record high. Energy stocks fell as crude prices dropped, Asia‑Pacific markets were mostly lower, European indices gained, and the U.S. 10‑year Treasury yield fell 6.6 basis points to 4.211%.",
