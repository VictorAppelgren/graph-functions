  "title": "New Book Tackles History and Legacy of Atomic Bomb",
  "description": "Garrett Graff, author of the new book The Devil Reached Toward the Sky: An Oral History of the Making and Unleashing of the Atomic Bomb, discussed the important lessons from the deployment of the atomic bomb as global tensions bring the world the closer to nuclear threats.  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Part of the challenge of looking back 80 years at Hiroshima and Nagasaki this week is that in 2025 we feel we are closer to the edge of nuclear danger than I think many people realize, and that we are closer than we have been for much of the last eight decades in between. You mentioned India and Pakistan are the two largest nuclear arsenals to ever come into open conflict. Earlier this year we've seen this year the the U.S. and Israeli raids on Iran's nuclear program. We have seen in the last couple of weeks, I mean, barely even in the last couple of hours, you know, nuclear saber rattling between the U.S. and Russia, both of which, by the way, are engaged in a decade long multi-trillion-dollar upgrade to all three legs of what you call the nuclear triad, the bombers, the missiles and the silo based ICBMs to carry these weapons forward for, you know, generations to come. And in the rising geopolitical instability of the United States and questions about our commitment to international alliances is launching new conversations about nuclear proliferation in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia, even in countries like Germany, where it would have been once unthinkable. And I think, you know, in a very weird moment, over the next decade, we are probably going to see more countries joining the nuclear club than we have ever seen before. Well, that's something to as we have this domestic debate right now about whether we should start opening more nuclear power plants to feed the electricity needs of AI. How big could this club get? Well, I think one. I mean, you're seeing these conversations in a lot of places, you know, in the Middle East, you know, to counter the possibility of Iran someday developing a weapon. You're seeing these conversations take place in Asia as countries like Korea talk about, you know, do they need their own nuclear umbrella in order to secure peace with North Korea? You're seeing this in Europe. You know, the UK and France and other sort of major European powers begin to think about, you know, what does it look like if we can't count on the American nuclear umbrella that we have counted on since 1945? You speak of umbrellas. You wonder if Oppenheimer could have ever envisioned the golden dome. Yeah. And and obviously, the you know, this is a project that dates back to the Reagan years, if not, you know, even earlier. And, you know, the the challenge of it has always been nuclear weapons are, you know, civilization destroying weapons. I mean, there's something that is not like any other weapon in the human arsenal. And we have a how's the power to use them in a very precarious system that in the United States is in the hands of the president of the United States himself. There is no second voice in that system. A lot of people think, you know, oh, well, surely the secretary of defense or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs has to agree with it or the commander of strategic command. No, the president lot can carry carries that nuclear football with him wherever he goes and can launch nuclear weapons from anywhere that he is at any time. That concerns General Milley out of that. This is something that we've experienced in our recent history, at least the concerns thereof. Let's talk about the book, because so many people became sort of armchair experts on the Manhattan Project following the movie. I'd love to know what you thought of that movie, by the way, but you really bring bring up the scale of this project, the The Secret Cities in Tennessee and Washington State, Hundreds of thousands of Americans working on a project that they weren't necessarily familiar with while it was happening. Absolutely. And that, to me, Oppenheimer is a fabulous movie. It's actually it's stunningly, historically accurate for a movie. But I think too often we over romanticize and oversimplify the story of the Manhattan Project as the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his band of merry physicists on ABC in Los Alamos. And what you come to understand when you look at the history of the Manhattan Project is the power and the majesty of it is in the industrial might that the United States brings. You know, in some ways it's a business story. And to me, you know, we talk so often in World War Two history about where it was fought, you know, Bastogne, Omaha Beach. El Alamein, Guadalcanal, they take off. But World War Two was won in the Ford Motor Company bomber factories in Willow Run in Michigan. It was won in the shipyards and landing craft factories of Higgins industry in New Orleans. And it was won in the Rad Lab in M.I.T., where radar and the proximity fuse are developed. And the lab of the Manhattan Project, where we build the atomic bomb, where we outbuild and help produce Germany and Japan and use in your rate that the so much of the Manhattan Project story is in takes place in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington. I spent a lot of time in the book telling the stories of the voices in the workers in those places. These are cities that, you know, are carved out of remote mountain valleys in Tennessee and desert and and farm orchards in eastern Washington that has 100,000 people apiece. You know, by the end of World War Two, Hanford, Washington, the largest construction project in in World War Two in the United States. And that these are facilities where we build the and refine the uranium and the plutonium. You know, we're building thousands of houses a month to to house. These workers were building factories, multiple football fields large. And the bus system in Oakridge, Tennessee. This was on August 6th, 1945, is the one of the ten largest public transit systems in the United States. And it serves a city that no one knows exists and doesn't appear on any public map. Incredible where the war was won. Fascinating the way you put that in. And everyone should understand that this is a narrative history you compiled, conducted and compiled some 500 different voices in this book. And it reads so quickly, you can't put this down, particularly when you're inside the B-29s. The way you put that together was remarkable with voices from the past. You talked about the people who actually not just made the bombs but dropped the bombs. Paul Tibbets Chuck Sweeny, You talk about when they first saw Iwo Jima through that glass cockpit in the B-29. A lot of this hit home for me. My grandfather fought on Iwo Jima. Like so many grandfathers of people my age, to liberate those airfields used on a mission like this. I also had the chance to meet Chuck Sweeney, and I flew in a B-29 with a bunch of years ago on Cape Cod, and they let him fly the plane. By the way, his family was with him. It was 51 of only two flying B-29 left in the world, I believe, and he was still so proud of what they accomplished, not just the drama of what they encountered. And you talk about how that they had to arm the bomb at altitude just in case the plane was lost. Yeah, I mean, we we have imposed sort of 80 years of sort of morality and, you know, complicated, vexing questions on these missions. But what really stands out for me and as you said, you know, it's an oral history. And so it's all in the first person, the voices of the bomber crew. Yeah. Their memories of the of the mission of the Enola Gay and Hiroshima, an August 6th boxcar to Nagasaki on August 9th. Yes. And then in those final chapters of the book, this incredible jarring juxtaposition of the celebration. Right. Of the bomber crew. This is what I want to get to. You had no idea what was going on the ground behind them, Who you know, the Enola Gay lands back in Tinian, in the Marianas Islands. Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay, has medals, you know, pinned on his chest on the tarmac. And then they go off to a literal celebratory barbecue for their successful mission, you know, back in Los Alamos, in Oak Ridge, in Hanford. Yeah, huge parties to celebrate the dropping of the atomic bombs juxtaposed with what is actually taking place back on the ground, first in Hiroshima, then in Nagasaki, these hurricane strength fire winds destroying and burning the city, tens of thousands of people dead. And I think you see in that sort of split screen moving back and forth between the bomber crews and the Manhattan Project and the the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yeah, the Manhattan Project is simultaneously one of humanity's greatest triumphs and one of humanity's greatest tragedies. God, that is so true. This is so great. Spending time with you were officially going into overtime here. So give me a couple of extra minutes of that dichotomy that you describe as something that's still talked about today. There are a lot of people who feel. We never should have dropped the bomb, that it was in fact, not necessary in to win the war against Japan. There were, in fact, scientists, in many cases Jewish refugees from Europe who said, this isn't why we designed this bomb. That was for Berlin. But when you talk to Chuck Sweeney or when I used to talk to my grandfather, they'd say, That's the only reason you're alive? Yes, because we were preparing for a mainland invasion that would have killed all of us. So how do we rationalize? Yeah. And this is where, again, you see the scientists really split, because some of them are, as you said, you know, the core of the Manhattan Project. They're all mostly Jewish refugees, scientists coming over from Europe who started this project, who worked on it day in, day out to stop Adolf Hitler from getting the bomb first. Yes. And by the time and their reaction is not we shouldn't use the bomb, it's that we're too late. It's, you know, I wish we had this bomb in 44 and could have dropped it on Berlin. Yeah, since we missed that and Hitler didn't get the bomb, let's not use it. Then there are the scientists, and I quote some of them in the book who are sort of like your dad, who they have family members caught up in the war. That's right. Who they can name. You know, one one of the women scientists, Leona Woods, core member of the Manhattan Project, you know, she's talking about her brother is a marine flamethrower on Okinawa. There you go. And he was headed to the Japanese home island invasion. Mm hmm. She knows he's alive because she invented the atomic bomb. That's right. And so these Marines, for the most case who are planning an invasion, are suddenly tasked with disarming Japanese officers. What an incredible historic turn. So it begs the question, Kyra Graf, if we hadn't used it, then, would we have ever used or maybe a better way to ask it is if it weren't for using it, then would be would we be preparing to use it now? Well, I think one, you know, one of the questions we'll never really be able to answer in in the context of history is it is the dropping of the atomic bomb the last act of World War Two, or is it the first act of the Cold War? And, you know, how much of the U.S. pressure and decision was really about demonstrating to the Soviets that we have this weapon as we begin to think about the geopolitical landscape afterward? I think it took using the bomb in combat for us as a society, certainly for the U.S. government, to recognize that this is not like any other weapon, that this is not something that we should ever use lightly. And in fact, it is. Dwight Eisenhower as president who really draws those first lines against in Korea, in the Suez crisis, in, you know, other crises during his presidency, really makes clear this is not like any other weapon and we can't ever use it. And it becomes the central defining organizing principle of international geopolitics ever since to never use these weapons again. And one of the reasons I wanted to do this project right now for the 80th, as we mark sort of the passing of the last survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is, I think it's worth remembering how terrible these weapons are and that it's up to us in our time to carry forward their life's mission that they are the last survivors of an atomic bomb.",
