      "text": "HOUSTON \u2014 Add another injury to a Houston Astros season defined by them.\nThe Astros placed All-Star closer Josh Hader on the injured list Tuesday, one day after he reported shoulder discomfort and did not pitch in a save situation against the Boston Red Sox.\n\u201cA punch to the gut,\u201d manager Joe Espada said before Tuesday\u2019s game against the Red Sox.\nAdvertisement\nThe Astros described Hader\u2019s injury as a left-shoulder strain and backdated his IL stint to Aug. 11. According to Espada, Hader was seeing doctors and getting additional testing done on Tuesday afternoon to determine the severity of his injury.\nThe team recalled Colton Gordon from Triple A to take Hader\u2019s spot on the active roster and reinstated right-hander Shawn Dubin from the injured list to further fortify the bullpen. Veteran H\u00e9ctor Neris was designated for assignment.\nHader, 31, has never been on the injured list during his nine-year major-league career aside from a stint on the COVID-19 IL in August 2021 after he tested positive for the virus.\nAccording to Espada, Hader experienced pain in his shoulder after completing some of his plyometric work prior to Monday\u2019s game. Hader warmed up to pitch in Sunday\u2019s game at Yankee Stadium, but went unused after the Astros scored three runs to widen their lead and eliminate a save situation.\nHader last appeared on Friday against the Yankees, throwing two innings and a season-high 36 pitches during the Astros\u2019 5-3, extra-inning win.\nOnce opposed to throwing multiple innings earlier in his career, Hader has softened his stance since signing a five-year, $95 million contract last winter. Hader has thrown multiple innings in 14 of his 119 regular-season outings as an Astro.\nAsked whether Hader recovered normally after Friday\u2019s outing, Espada replied, \u201cHe played catch (on Saturday) and then I got him up on Sunday. Everything was fine until yesterday, he came in and was doing his warmup, and it did not feel right.\u201d\nHader has converted 28 of his 29 save chances during a dominant season that produced his sixth All-Star selection. His 28 saves trail only San Diego\u2019s Robert Su\u00e1rez and Kansas City\u2019s Carlos Est\u00e9vez for the major-league lead.\nAdvertisement\nHader\u2019s 2.05 ERA is lower than those of Su\u00e1rez and Est\u00e9vez. Among American League closers, only Seattle\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz and Boston\u2019s Aroldis Chapman have lower ERAs than Hader.\nHader has appeared in 42 of the Astros\u2019 first 67 wins while only throwing in six losses, underscoring his importance to a team that thrives on its run prevention and execution in close games. The Astros entered Tuesday with a 21-12 record in one-run games and 56-1 when leading after eight innings, two marks that are a testament to Hader\u2019s dominance.\nOn Tuesday, Espada resisted assigning any defined roles in Hader\u2019s absence. Set-up man Bryan Abreu, he of a 1.67 ERA and 13.1 strikeouts per nine innings, is the most obvious option to take closing duties in Hader\u2019s absence, but Espada maintained, \u201cI\u2019m not naming (anyone) for the ninth, not naming (anyone) for the eighth.\u201d\n\u201cI was talking to the relievers about this. Josh Hader, (for) how successful he\u2019s been, he needs guys to give him the ball with the lead in the ninth. All these guys have set him up to be the closer that he is,\u201d Espada said. \u201cNot taking anything away from Josh \u2014 Josh is probably the best \u2014 but you need guys to help him get to that point. These guys are capable of doing that.\u201d\nIn the absence of established roles, Espada will take a matchup-based approach for however long Hader is sidelined.\nEven in Hader\u2019s absence, Houston has a lefty-heavy bullpen that has bullied right-handed hitters all season \u2014 giving Espada myriad options late in games.\nEntering Tuesday, Astros left-handed relievers had faced 583 right-handed hitters and limited them to a .593 OPS. Dubin is a hard-throwing right-handed option who can contribute multiple innings.\nDitto for newcomer Enyel De Los Santos, who started the ninth inning of a one-run game on Monday in Hader\u2019s absence. Southpaw Bennett Sousa finished it, striking out Roman Anthony to strand the tying run at second base.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat you guys saw yesterday, piecing it together, we\u2019re going to have to do more of that,\u201d Espada said on Tuesday.\nHader joins seven other Astros pitchers on an injured list that has grown as large as 18 players during this star-crossed season. Within the past week, starters Cristian Javier and Spencer Arrighetti have returned from long-term injuries, which was encouraging news for the team\u2019s overall pitching health. Hader\u2019s shoulder discomfort now diminishes that progress.\n(Photo: Tim Warner / Getty Images)"

      "text": "CBS reporter Amanda Balionis enjoyed some R&R in Ibiza before she hits the sidelines for the 2025 NFL season.\nTaking to Instagram, Balionis shared a carousel of snapshots from the trip she took with her grade school friends and their partners.\n\u201cHey Ibiza.. It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in. Our headsets and mics work flawlessly, our sets are stocked, and our camera operators have been setting the scene for days.\u201d\nBalionis made headlines off the course last May when a Daily Mail report linked her and McIlroy after he filed for divorce from his wife of seven years, Erica Stoll.\nMcIlroy, 36, and Stoll have since reunited, and his divorce petition was voluntarily dismissed.\nFans noticed Balionis wasn\u2019t wearing her wedding ring last February while covering the Genesis Invitational.\nBalionis married former North Carolina quarterback Bryn Renner, who also had a brief career in the NFL, in 2022.\nBalionis, who wasn\u2019t wearing her ring in the Ibiza photos, has not publicly addressed speculation about a divorce, but Renner no longer appears on her social media pages.\nUs Weekly confirmed last spring that Balinois and the reigning Masters champ \u201care not dating and only have a professional relationship.\u201d\nBalionis joined CBS Sports in 2017 as a golf reporter and also serves as a sideline reporter for select NFL ON CBS games and CBS Sports Network college football games."
