  "title": "Nvidia Earnings Expectations Buoy Market Ahead of Report Nvidia Q2 2026 earnings",
  "description": "Nvidia dominates the AI market, which means the company\u2019s earnings results are highly anticipated each quarter.",
  "content": "The S&P 500 surged ahead of earnings results to hit a record high of 6,481.40 Wednesday just ahead of quarterly earnings from the world\u2019s largest company, chipmaker Nvidia.\n\n\u201cNvidia is going to produce humongous revenue gains over the next nine months, on top of an already humongous revenue base,\u201d said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital, told Reuters. \u201cInvestors should prepare themselves for a world where Nvidia is a double-digit percentage of the S&P 500.\u201d\n\nWhy do Nvidia\u2019s earnings move the market so much?\n\nNvidia dominates the AI market, which means the company\u2019s earnings results are highly anticipated each quarter. But the stakes were particularly high going into Wednesday\u2019s earnings.\n\nLast month, Nvidia became the first company to hit $4 trillion market value, and the pressure was on for the tech giant to justify that valuation.\n\nAlso weighing on investors were talks of an AI bubble, stemming from a worrisome new AI report from MIT researchers. The report spooked investors with its finding that despite the bold investments, AI pilot programs in the corporate world have failed to translate to substantial revenue gains.\n\nInvestor fears were stoked further when in the same week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed that he believes AI is a bubble.\n\nBack in May, Nvidia executives had to revise their revenue expectations for this quarter down by about $8 billion due to President Trump\u2019s decision to impose export control restrictions on the company\u2019s sales to China.\n\nThe company has been on a policy rollercoaster ride in its efforts to sell AI chips in China, one of Nvidia\u2019s major markets, as the trade war between the U.S. and China escalates.\n\nAfter banning the sale of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China, President Trump reversed that decision in July, thanks to Huang\u2019s efforts. In first quarter earnings, Nvidia incurred $4.5 billion in charges from excess H20 inventory. Nvidia executives had shared that they expected to have recorded an additional $2.5 billion in H20 chip sales, but it failed to materialize due to the restrictions.\n\nBut in exchange for the policy reversal, Trump demanded that Nvidia and competitor AMD both give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their chips revenue in China.\n\nIn response to that, Beijing has reportedly started raising concerns about Nvidia\u2019s chips having kill switches and backdoors, and urged Chinese companies to not use them.\n\nThe numbers come as Nvidia has started to grow its bet on robotics and autonomous vehicles in the past few months.\n\nAt the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in June, Huang said that he expects robotics to provide the largest growth for the company after AI. The two combined, he told investors, represent \u201ca multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity.\u201d",

      "text": "People have ridiculed GPT-5, the newest large language model release from OpenAI, since the second it launched, with many users complaining that it\u2019s dumb, boring, and not as good as the last LLM that the company released. Sam Altman, the company\u2019s CEO, has some comforting words for those who may be concerned about the direction his company is headed: AI is a bubble, and oh, also btw, my company is about to spend the GDP of France to build out our AI infrastructure.\nThat seems to be the gist of what Altman said during a dinner held in San Francisco on Thursday with a group of journalists and other OpenAI execs, according to The Verge. During that casual conversation, Altman admitted that his company\u2019s latest software release had been bungled, but promised that the future was bright for his company, as well as his industry.\n\u201cI think we totally screwed up some things on the rollout,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, our API traffic doubled in 48 hours and is growing. We\u2019re out of GPUs. ChatGPT has been hitting a new high of users every day. A lot of users really do love the model switcher. I think we\u2019ve learned a lesson about what it means to upgrade a product for hundreds of millions of people in one day.\u201d\nAt the same time, Altman appears to agree with critics of his industry who have called it a \u201cbubble\u201d akin to the early internet. \u201cAre we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?\u201d Altman said. \u201cMy opinion is yes.\u201d\nFor quite some time, critics and commentators alike have wondered whether the excitement around the AI industry is due for a precipitous collapse. Some recent industry moves\u2014like a very unfortunate stock day for datacenter and AI infrastructure startup Coreweave\u2014have added to such concerns. Many onlookers have noted that, so far, AI is a money pit into which companies continue to hurl vast sums of cash. The dream is that, someday, somehow, all that cash will come back to the AI industry in the form of a profit, but who knows when that day will come?\nDuring his conversation with journalists, Altman added: \u201cWhen bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\u201d Altman said. \u201cIf you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.\u201d\nWhether AI is a bubble or not, Altman still wants to spend a certifiably insane amount of money building out his company\u2019s AI infrastructure. \u201cYou should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,\u201d Altman told reporters.\nIt\u2019s this truly absurd scale of investment in AI that spurs the casual onlooker to wonder what it\u2019s really all for. Indeed, the one question that never seems to get raised during conversations with Altman is whether a society-wide cost-benefit analysis has ever been run on his industry. In other words, is AI really worth it?\nThis single question could easily be pared down into a variety of more specific questions. For instance, one good question might be: Is it really worth spending trillions of dollars just to create a line of mildly amusing chatbots that only give you accurate information a certain percentage of the time? Or: Wouldn\u2019t trillions of dollars be better spent, like, helping the poor or improving our educational system? Also: Are chatbots a societal necessity, or do they just seem sorta nice to have around? How much more useful is AI than, say, a search engine? Can\u2019t we just stick to search engines? Do the negative externalities associated with AI use (a massive energy footprint, alleged reduced mental capacities in users, and a plague of cheating in higher education) outweigh the positive ones (access to a slightly more convenient way to find information online)?"

      "text": "A new report from MIT is casting doubt on the hype around the financial value AI brings to businesses, and may be triggering a small tech stock sell-off on Tuesday.\nThe report, The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, found that the promised AI gold rush isn\u2019t paying off for most companies yet.\nDespite the major push to adopt AI tools in the corporate world, fewer than one in ten AI pilot programs have generated real revenue gains. The rest are having no impact on a company\u2019s bottom line, according to MIT\u2019s report\u2014based on 150 executive interviews, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments.\n\u201cJust 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable [profit and loss] impact,\u201d the report said. Meaning that \u201c95 per cent of organizations are getting zero return.\u201d\nThe eye-opening report spooked investors and sent AI stocks sliding. Nvidia dropped 3.5% on Tuesday, Arm Holdings fell 3.8%, and data analytics firm Palantir took the hardest hit, plunging nearly 9% yesterday and is still sinking this morning.\nAditya Challapally, the report\u2019s lead author, told Fortune the problem isn\u2019t necessarily the AI models themselves, but that most companies don\u2019t know how to use them to their full potential.\n\u201cSome large companies\u2019 pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,\u201d Challapally said. He highlighted startups run by 20-year-olds as good examples of how businesses should use AI. He said these startups \u201chave seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year. It\u2019s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools.\u201d\nMost companies, though, are misplacing their resources. More than half of generative AI budgets are funneled into sales and marketing tools, but MIT found that real returns come from boring back-office automation\u2014things like eliminating business process outsourcing and streamlining operations.\nAdditionally, buying specialized tools or teaming up with outside vendors works about 67% of the time, while homegrown builds only succeed one-third as often. That\u2019s a big deal in industries like finance, where companies are pouring money into building their own proprietary systems. MIT\u2019s takeaway is that going solo carries more risk for failure.\nThe report also dropped just days after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned that an AI bubble may be forming.\n\u201cI do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money, and I don\u2019t want to minimize that\u2014that sucks,\u201d Altman said, according to the Financial Times. \u201cThere will be periods of irrational exuberance. But on the whole, the value for society will be huge.\u201d\nMeta shares also dipped after it announced a major shake-up in its AI division, a move some are seeing as a bad sign for the company\u2019s AI ambitions that adds to the worries of an AI bubble."

      "text": "Nvidia made history on Wednesday, becoming the first company in the world to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization. This unprecedented milestone solidifies its position as a dominant force in the global economy and a key player in the artificial intelligence revolution.\nWhile OpenAI and its viral chatbot ChatGPT might be the public face of AI, Wall Street looks to Nvidia as the true barometer of this transformative technology. Nvidia designs and manufactures the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the backbone of the data centers powering AI models and cloud services. These specialized chips are crucial for the complex calculations required by AI, making NVIDIA an indispensable part of the AI infrastructure boom. Its chips are essential for the enormous computing workloads required to train and run artificial intelligence.\nThe company\u2019s immense market share in the AI chip sector means its performance directly reflects the scale of investment flowing into AI. According to market research firm The International Data Corporation, spending on AI infrastructure is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2030, with Nvidia positioned to capture a significant portion of this growth.\n\u201cThe Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia hit $4 trillion market cap,\u201d commented Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, an AI bull. \u201cAI Revolution and huge historical moment for US Tech sector.\u201d\nThe Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia hit $4 trillion market cap. AI Revolution and huge historical moment for US Tech sector \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc02\ud83c\udfaf\n\u2014 Dan Ives (@DivesTech) July 9, 2025\nNvidia\u2019s journey to this monumental valuation is remarkable. For years, the company was primarily known and beloved by gamers and online communities for its high-performance GPUs, which provided the processing power for cutting-edge video games. However, its versatile chips proved equally adept at powering not just artificial intelligence, but also robotics and autonomous vehicles. The recent rollout of its flagship AI chip, Blackwell, just months ago, further underscores Nvidia\u2019s aggressive innovation and future potential.\nThis historic achievement comes despite significant geopolitical challenges. For several months, Nvidia has been banned from selling its most powerful chips to China due to escalating tech tensions between the United States and China. The company reported missing out on $2.5 billion in revenue in the last quarter ending in April because of these export restrictions.\nDespite these headwinds, Nvidia\u2019s financial performance has been extraordinary. In the most recent quarter, the company recorded approximately $44.1 billion in revenue, a staggering 69% increase year over year. Its net income soared to an impressive $18.8 billion, up 26% from the previous year.\nNvidia\u2019s market cap trajectory has been nothing short of spectacular:\n- March 2000: $5 billion\n- 2020: $200 billion\n- May 2021: $1 trillion\n- June 2024: $3 trillion\n- July 9, 2025: $4 trillion\nNvidia market cap milestones:\nJul 2025: $4 trillion\nJun 2024: $3 trillion\nFeb 2024: $2 trillion\nJan 2024: $1.5 trillion\nMay 2023: $1 trillion\nJul 2021: $500 billion\nMay 2020: $200 billion\nAug 2017: $100 billion\nApr 2016: $20 billion\nJan 2002: $10 billion\nMar 2000: $5 billion\u2014 Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) July 9, 2025\nNvidia, led by CEO Jensen Huang, surpassed tech giants Apple and Microsoft to claim the $4 trillion title. Apple, which started the year with a market cap of $3.9 trillion, was widely expected to be the first to reach this milestone. However, the ongoing trade disputes, particularly impacting Apple\u2019s China-centric supply chain, along with perceptions that it lags behind in the current AI race, allowed Nvidia to seize the lead. Microsoft, a significant player in AI through its investments in OpenAI and products like Copilot, had been trading the top spot with Nvidia in recent days. But during the current trading session, a 2.5% gain propelled Nvidia decisively above the $4 trillion mark, making it the only company globally at this valuation.\nNvidia\u2019s unprecedented success serves as a powerful testament to the real, tangible potential of artificial intelligence for anyone still doubting its impact. This milestone not only reflects Nvidia\u2019s current dominance but also signals a profound shift in the global economy, driven by the relentless expansion of AI."

      "text": "It\u2019s a major victory for the world\u2019s most valuable company in the ongoing tech war. The Trump administration has reportedly granted Nvidia a license to resume selling its specialized AI chips to the lucrative Chinese market, a decision that follows months of high-stakes lobbying and direct appeals to the White House by CEO Jensen Huang.\nThe move is a massive financial relief for the AI giant. It allows Nvidia to avoid a projected $8 billion revenue shortfall for the fiscal year and re-enter a market that Huang himself estimates will be worth $50 billion in the coming years.\nAccording to the Financial Times, the breakthrough came after Huang\u2019s visit to the White House on August 6 to meet with President Donald Trump. Just two days later, the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, reportedly issued the first licenses for Nvidia to sell its H2O chips in China.\nThe High-Stakes Background\nThis decision is the latest chapter in the ongoing U.S.-China tech war. The core issue is the fear that advanced American technology could be used by Beijing to develop sophisticated military AI. To prevent this, the U.S. has imposed strict export controls, blocking the sale of top-tier AI chips to China.\nNvidia\u2019s most powerful processors, like its Blackwell series, are banned for export to China. In response, Nvidia cleverly designed the H2O chip, a less-powerful version of its advanced technology, specifically tailored to comply with the original export rules.\nHowever, the Trump administration took an even tougher stance in April, banning the sale of even these de-powered H2O chips. The move sent shockwaves through Nvidia. The company was forced to halt shipments, resulting in a $4.5 billion charge for excess inventory and purchase obligations. In May, Nvidia warned investors that the restrictions would cost the company an estimated $8 billion in revenue for the full fiscal year.\nThe Power of Personal Diplomacy\nReversing this policy took months of intense diplomacy and lobbying, culminating in Huang\u2019s personal visits to the White House. The CEO\u2019s charm offensive appears to have worked, drastically changing President Trump\u2019s perspective on the company. During a White House AI summit last month, Trump admitted he had initially considered taking antitrust action against the chip giant before he got to know its CEO.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Look, we\u2019ll break this guy up,\u2019 before I learned the facts of life,\u201d Trump said of Huang during a speech. \u201cI said, \u2018Who the hell is he? What\u2019s his name? What the hell is Nvidia? I\u2019ve never heard of it before.\u2019\u201d\nThe president continued, \u201cThen I got to know Jensen, and now I see why,\u201d inviting Huang, who was in the audience, to stand up. That meeting appears to have been the turning point, convincing the administration that protecting Nvidia\u2019s financial health was crucial for maintaining America\u2019s lead in the global AI race.\nWhat This Means for the World\u2019s Biggest Company\nFor Nvidia, the news is a massive relief. The company, which last month became the first to reach a $4 trillion market value, is now hovering around $4.45 trillion. With the $8 billion revenue threat now averted and the $50 billion China market reopened, investors will be watching closely when Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings later this month. Another strong report could easily push the AI titan past the unprecedented $5 trillion threshold.\nNvidia declined to comment. The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "text": "Could humanoid robots get a lot more human? Nvidia may have made that possibility a bit realer today with a smarter robot brain that has less energy demands.\nThe tech giant\u2019s latest robotics offering is Jetson Thor, a super computer built for real-time AI computation on humanoid robots and smart machines alike, Nvidia announced in a press release on Monday.\nThe new module is built to handle larger amounts of information at less energy than previous model Jetson Orin. Powered by the latest Blackwell GPUs, Jetson Thor has more than seven times the AI compute power and twice the memory at more than three times speed and efficiency than its predecessor, Nvidia claims.\nAll this new power is supposed to unlock higher speed sensor data and visual reasoning that can help humanoid robots get better at autonomously seeing, moving, and making decisions.\n\u201cJetson Thor solves one of the most significant challenges in robotics: enabling robots to have real-time, intelligent interactions with people and the physical world,\u201d the company wrote.\nIt\u2019s a considerable performance leap that Nvidia hopes will appeal to engineers. The company says early adopters include Amazon, Meta, Caterpillar, and Agility Robotics, a startup that makes commercially available humanoid robots for warehouses and other manufacturing facilities. The model is being considered for adoption by John Deere and OpenAI.\nIt\u2019s also being adopted by research labs at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Zurich, to power autonomous robots in medical research settings and more, Nvidia said in a blog post on Monday.\nThe developer kit Jetson AGX Thor, which includes the Jetson T5000 module plus a reference carrier board, power supply, and an active heatsink with a fan, is now on sale on the company\u2019s website starting at $3,499.\nComing soon\u2014and available now on pre-order\u2014is Nvidia Drive AGX Thor, a developer kit using the same technology but for autonomous vehicles instead. Deliveries for that are slated to start in September, the company said.\nNvidia\u2019s growing bet on robotics\nAlthough AI chips are Nvidia\u2019s bread and butter, the tech giant is betting big on robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\u201cThis is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview in June.\nHuang elaborated on his trust in just how much the robotics industry can scale at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting later that month.\nAlong with AI, Nvidia expects robotics to provide the largest growth for the company, and combined, the two represent \u201ca multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,\u201d Huang told investors.\nEarlier this year, the company also released a family of AI models that can be used to train humanoid robots, called Cosmos.\nHuang\u2019s bet isn\u2019t an empty one. Humanoid robots are advancing.\nJust last week, China, one of the key players in the global robotics race, hosted its first-ever robot Olympics, World Humanoid Robot Games. At the three-day spectacle, companies showcased robots that can complete a 1,500-meter race in just a little over six seconds and achieve practical job skills like sorting medicine or taking food orders.\nBut still, the technology is hugely limited and far from widespread adoption. Even at the great robotics showcase in China, many of the robots suffered technical difficulties. One robot in the track and field race even ran straight into and knocked over a bystander walking off-course.\nBig week ahead for Nvidia\nNvidia made the announcement at a rather convenient time for the company. The tech giant is reporting fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday afternoon, and the market is buzzing already.\nNvidia dominates the AI market, so the company\u2019s earnings always draw huge speculation, but the importance this week is boosted by volatile policy changes and questions around the economic value of wide-scale AI adoption.\nThe company has been on a policy rollercoaster ride in its efforts to sell AI chips in China amidst the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington. China is a major market for Nvidia, and the uncertainty is keeping company investors at the edge of their seats.\nAlso keeping investors occupied is a concerning new AI report from MIT researchers. The report found that despite the bold bets on AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in 10 AI pilot programs have translated to real revenue gains.\nNvidia just hit $4 trillion market value last month, becoming the first public company to achieve the feat. Now, the stakes are high, as it\u2019s up to the tech giant to prove that it\u2019s valuation is not just built on AI hype."

  "argos_summary": "Nvidia\u2019s stock surged to a record high, pushing the company to a $4 trillion market cap and making it the world\u2019s most valuable firm, as investors brace for its upcoming earnings. The rally is driven by Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI chips, its expanding robotics and autonomous vehicle bets, and a recent policy reversal that lifted export restrictions on its chips in China. Amid this optimism, a MIT report warned that fewer than 10% of corporate AI pilots deliver real revenue, sparking concerns about an AI bubble echoed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The market remains volatile, with Nvidia\u2019s performance seen as a barometer for the broader AI industry\u2019s economic impact.",
