Generate Key Takeaways\n\nDoctor Who star David Tennant is set to play real-life journalist Nick Davies in the upcoming ITV series The Hack, and his transformation for the role leaves him unrecognizable.\n\nTennant, 54, appeared in first-look photos for ITV's phone hacking drama with a completely new look. His hair was grayed, giving Tennant an aged look, in photos shared by Deadline.\n\nThe Hack is based on a true story based on the investigation into a major phone hacking saga at Rupert Murdoch's defunct British tabloid, News of the World.\n\n\"Set between 2002 and 2012, The Hack interweaves two real life stories, the work of Davies, who uncovered evidence of phone hacking at Murdoch\u2019s now-defunct News of the World, and the story of the investigation into the unsolved murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan, led by former Met Police Detective Chief Superintendent Dave Cook [played by Robert Carlyle],\" Deadline reported. According to the outlet, The Hack was previously titled Broken News and Mandrake, before landing on its official name.\n\nThe Harry Potter star previously referred to the upcoming role as \"very intense.\"\n\n\u201cJust because there's a lot of quite complicated information in that,\u201d he said during an appearance on the \"Off Menu\" podcast. \u201cI'm playing a journalist who sort of broke the case open, and there's just a lot of quite technical stuff. And obviously you have to be very specific on that because there's a lot of lawyers watching to make sure you don't say the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tennant and Carlyle, he highly-anticipated series also stars Toby Jones, Rose Leslie, Dougray Scott, Eve Myles, Adrian Lester, Katherine Kelly, Kevin Doyle, Neil Maskell, and others.\n\nWhile the series was first announced in January, the network has yet to announce a premiere date.\n\n\u2018Doctor Who\u2019 Star Is Unrecognizable After Transformation for Next Role first appeared on Men's Journal on Aug 6, 2025",

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The timing couldn\u2019t be better. Just a week after Rupert Murdoch\u2018s shock apology and settlement with Prince Harry, ITV has unveiled a phone hacking drama series from Jack Thorne starring David Tennant as investigative journalist Nick Davies.\nITV and Australian streamer Stan have spent the past year quietly filming, editing and laying the groundwork for The Hack, which comes from the storied creative trio of multi-BAFTA Award winner Thorne, director Lewis Arnold (Sherwood) and producer Patrick Spence (Mr Bates vs the Post Office).\nSet between 2002 and 2012, The Hack interweaves two real life stories, the work of Davies, who uncovered evidence of phone hacking at Murdoch\u2019s now-defunct News of the World, and the story of the investigation into the unsolved murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan, led by former Met Police Detective Chief Superintendent Dave Cook. Its working titles through the past year have included Broken News and Mandrake.\nWatch on Deadline\nTennant, who has been winning plaudits for his performance in Disney+\u2019s Rivals, is playing Davies, Robert Carlyle is Cook and Toby Jones has secured the role of Alan Rusbridger, the ex-Editor-in-Chief of The Guardian, which covered the story in depth. Rose Leslie, Dougray Scott, Eve Myles, Adrian Lester, Katherine Kelly, Kevin Doyle, Neil Maskell, Lara Pulver, Lee Ingleby, Pip Torrens, Lisa McGrillis, Sean Pertwee, Robert Bathurst, Richard Pepple, Nadia Albina, Phil Davis, Ace Bhatti, Charlie Brooks and Steve Pemberton also star.\nThe phone hacking scandal led to the closure of the News of the World and imprisonment of its ex-editor Andy Coulson. Davies wrote an award-winning book about it, Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch. The headline-grabbing story reared its head again last week after Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers (NGN) apologized to Prince Harry, settled with him and for the first time admitted \u201cunlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun.\u201d Harry and a group including Hugh Grant are now pushing for police to investigate NGN over perjury and broader cover-ups.\n\u201cStrange and deceptive piece of history\u201d\nThorne, who is in the middle of a plethora of projects including an A24 series about Liverpool soccer club, described the phone hacking scandal as a \u201cstrange and deceptive piece of our recent history.\u201d \u201cI thought, as someone who is interested in politics, I understood everything that happened,\u201d he added. \u201cI did not.\u201d\nITV drama head Polly Hill, who commissioned the series, paid homage to \u201ca brilliant team and the perfect people to bring this story to screen,\u201d while Spence added: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that several questions remain unanswered. This drama is our contribution to that conversation.\u201d\nThe team is not the first to tackle phone hacking. Thank You & Goodbye, which examined the newsroom of the News of the World and phone hacking, was in development with the BBC two and a half years ago but appears to have stalled.\nITV Studios is producing with Anonymous, United Agents and Casarotto Ramsay-backed AC Chapter One, with the pair re-teaming following the smash hit success of Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the ITV drama that broke viewing records and generated headlines for weeks. Thorne\u2019s One Shoe Films is also a co-producer. Between them, Thorne, Arnold and Spence have won seven BAFTAs.\nAnnalisa Dinnella (Sex Education, Ralph & Katie) has written one of the episodes and is co-writing two of the episodes with Thorne. ITV Studios is selling internationally and is co-financing.\nWhen and where will it be Streaming? PLEASE!\nWell they kept that quiet! This sounds great."
