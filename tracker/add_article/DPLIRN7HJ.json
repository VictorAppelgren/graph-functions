      "title": "DC Attorney General Sues Over Trump's 'Hostile Takeover'",
      "summary": "Washington DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit to block President Trump’s federal takeover of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department, arguing that the appointment of DEA Administrator Terry Cole as emergency police commissioner exceeds the limited authority granted under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. Trump invoked Section 740 to deploy the National Guard and appoint Attorney General Pam Bondi as his stand‑in, citing rampant crime and homelessness. The suit seeks to restore command to Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Pamela Smith, who has publicly shown uncertainty about the new chain of command. A linked article from Modernity News highlights Smith’s confusion over the term “chain of command” amid the federal intervention, underscoring the administrative turmoil in DC policing.",
