  "description": "Islamist radicals destroyed more than 4,000 manuscripts, some dating back to the 13th century, after they seized Timbuktu in 2012, according to a U.N. mission's findings.",
  "content": "Members of the Malian government return boxes containing ancient Timbuktu manuscripts to the community\u2019s elders on Monday.\n\nThe Malian military government on Monday started returning home the historic manuscripts of Timbuktu that were spirited out of their fabled northern city when it was occupied by Al Qaeda-linked militants more than a decade ago.\n\nIslamist radicals destroyed more than 4,000 manuscripts, some dating back to the 13th century, after they seized Timbuktu in 2012, according to the findings of a United Nations expert mission. They also destroyed nine mausoleums and a mosque\u2019s door \u2014 all but one of the buildings on the UNESCO World Heritage list.\n\nThe majority of the documents dating back to the 13th century \u2014 more than 27,000 \u2014 were saved by the devotion of the Timbuktu library\u2019s Malian custodians, who carried them out of the occupied city in rice sacks, on donkey carts, by motorcycle, by boat and four-wheel-drive vehicles.\n\nThe first batch of the manuscripts were brought to Timbuktu by plane from the capital of Bamako, authorities said, adding that the return was necessary to protect them from the threats of Bamako\u2019s humidity.\n\nThe shipment consisted of more than 200 crates and weighed some 5.5 tons. The rest would be shipped in the coming days, officials said.\n\nAbout 439 miles from Bamako, Timbuktu sits on the edge of the Sahara desert and has a dry climate. For years, the local municipal and religious authorities have asked for the return of the manuscripts.\n\nDiahara Tour\u00e9, Timbuktu\u2019s deputy mayor, said the famous documents are important to the local people as they \u201creflect our civilization and spiritual and intellectual heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first stage\u201d of the return, said Bilal Mahamane Traor\u00e9, a local official.\n\nIn February, the military government made a commitment to return the manuscripts, according to Bour\u00e9ma Kansaye, the Malian Minister of Higher Education. He described them as a \u201clegacy that bears witness to the intellectual greatness and crossroads of civilization\u201d of the city of Timbuktu \u2014 \u201ca bridge between the past and the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now have a responsibility to protect, digitize, study and promote these treasures so that they continue to enlighten Mali, Africa and the world,\u201d Kansaye said during Monday\u2019s return ceremony.\n\nThe manuscripts, which UNESCO has designated as part of the World Cultural Heritage, cover a myriad of subjects, including Islamic theology and jurisprudence, astronomy, medicine, mathematics, history and geography. They are a testimony to the rich cultural heritage of the Mali and Songhai empires in West Africa.\n\nMali, along with neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger, has long battled an insurgency by armed militants, including some allied with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State group. Following two military coups, the ruling junta expelled French troops and instead turned to Russia for security assistance.\n\nStill, 13 years after the occupation of Timbuktu, the security situation in Mali remains precarious and analysts say it has worsened in recent months. Although the city is back under government control, militants continue attacking its surroundings, including as recently as last month.\n\nAhmed writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "Sacred statues sold despite experts\u2019 pleas that they were stolen during Nigerian civil war\n- Share via\nPARIS \u2014 A pair of sacred statues that a Nigerian museum commission and protesters said were looted during the country\u2019s 1960s civil war fetched $239,000 at auction in Paris on Monday.\nThe Igbo statues were sold by Christie\u2019s auction house, which defended the sale and said the artworks were legitimately acquired.\nA Princeton University scholar, Chika Okeke-Agulu, alongside Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, raised alarms this month that the objects were looted during the Biafran war in the late 1960s.\nThe war saw more than 1 million people die, many of starvation, trying to create a state for the Igbo people. The Igbo are one of Nigeria\u2019s largest ethnic groups.\nOkeke-Agulu, who is Igbo, said the objects were taken through \u201can act of violence\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be sold. An online petition with the hashtags BlackArtsMatter and MyHeritageMatters collected more than 3,000 signatures demanding the auction be halted.\nThe petition said \u201cas the world awakens to the reality of systemic racial injustice and inequality, thanks to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, we must not forget that it is not just the Black body, but also Black culture, identity and especially art that is being misappropriated.\u201d\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, the auction house said \u201cthese objects are being lawfully sold having been publicly exhibited and previously sold over the last decades prior to Christie\u2019s involvement.\u201d\nChristie\u2019s said it recognized the \u201cnuanced and complex debates around cultural property,\u201d but also argued that such sales stop illegal markets from flourishing.\nBabatunde E. Adebiyi, legal advisor for the National Commission for Museums and Monuments of Nigeria, said officials had contacted Christie\u2019s on June 17 and had asked the auction house to suspend the sales pending further investigation into their origins.\n\u201cWe are shocked the sales went on,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cIt represents a major setback in our effort to get our antiquities from abroad.\u201d\nIn recent years, French courts have consistently ruled in favor of auction houses whose sales of sacred objects, such as Hopi tribal masks, were contested by rights groups and representatives of the tribes.\nParis has a long history of collecting and selling tribal artifacts, tied to its colonial past in Africa, and to Paris-based groups in the 1960s, such as the \u201cIndianist\u201d movement, that celebrated indigenous tribal cultures.\nInterest in tribal art in Paris was revived in the early 2000s following two high-profile \u2014 and highly lucrative \u2014 sales in Paris of tribal art owned by late collectors Andre Breton and Robert Lebel."

      "text": "New Dead Sea Scrolls dating back nearly 2,000 years found in Israel\n- Share via\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli archaeologists Tuesday announced the discovery of dozens of new Dead Sea Scroll fragments bearing text from the Hebrew Bible and dating back about 1,900 years. The ancient fragments were found in a desert cave and believed hidden during a Jewish revolt against Rome.\nThe fragments of parchment bear lines of Greek text from the biblical books of Zechariah and Nahum and have been radiocarbon-dated to the 2nd century, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority. They are the first new scrolls found in archaeological excavations in the desert south of Jerusalem in 60 years.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of Jewish texts found in desert caves in the West Bank near Qumran in the 1940s and 1950s, date from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD. They include the earliest-known copies of biblical texts and documents outlining the beliefs of a little-understood Jewish sect.\nThe roughly 80 new pieces are believed to belong to a set of parchment fragments found in a site known as the \u201cCave of Horror\u201d \u2014 named for the 40 human skeletons found there during excavations in the 1960s \u2014 that also bear a Greek rendition of the Twelve Minor Prophets, a book in the Hebrew Bible. The cave is located in a remote canyon about 25 miles south of Jerusalem.\nThe artifacts were found during an operation in Israel and the occupied West Bank conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority to find scrolls and other artifacts to prevent possible plundering. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East War, and international law prohibits the removal of cultural property from occupied territory. The authority held a news conference Tuesday to unveil the discovery.\nThe fragments are believed to have been stashed away in the cave during the Bar Kochba Revolt, an armed Jewish uprising against Rome during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, between AD 132 and 136. Coins struck by rebels and arrowheads found in other caves in the region also hail from that period.\nThe eternal disputes of the Dead Sea Scrolls\n\u201cWe found a textual difference that has no parallel with any other manuscript, either in Hebrew or in Greek,\u201d said Oren Ableman, a Dead Sea Scroll researcher with the Israel Antiquities Authority. He referred to slight variations in the Greek rendering of the Hebrew original compared to the Septuagint \u2014 a translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek made in Egypt in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.\n\u201cWhen we think about the biblical text, we think about something very static. It wasn\u2019t static. There are slight differences, and some of those differences are important,\u201d said Joe Uziel, head of the antiquities authority\u2019s Dead Sea Scrolls unit. \u201cEvery little piece of information that we can add, we can understand a little bit better\u201d how the biblical text came into its traditional Hebrew form.\nAlongside the Roman-era artifacts, the exhibit included other discoveries of no lesser importance found during the authority\u2019s sweep of more than 500 caves in the desert: the 6,000-year-old mummified skeleton of a child; an immense, complete woven basket from the Neolithic period, estimated to be 10,500 years old; and other delicate organic materials preserved in the caves\u2019 arid climate.\nIn 1961, Israeli archaeologist Yohanan Aharoni excavated the \u201cCave of Horror,\u201d where his team found nine parchment fragments belonging to a scroll with texts from the Twelve Minor Prophets in Greek, and a scrap of Greek papyrus.\nSometimes science seems like science, and sometimes it seems like magic.\nSince then, no new texts have been found during archaeological excavations, but many have turned up on the black market, apparently plundered from caves.\nFor the last four years, Israeli archaeologists have launched a major campaign to scour caves nestled in the precipitous canyons of the Judean Desert in search of scrolls and other rare artifacts. The aim is to find them before plunderers disturb the remote sites and destroy archaeological strata and data in search of antiquities to sell on the black market.\nUntil now, the hunt had found only a handful of parchment scraps that bore no text.\nAmir Ganor, head of the antiquities authority\u2019s theft-prevention unit, said that since the commencement of the operation in 2017 there has been virtually no plundering in the Judean Desert.\n\u201cFor the first time in 70 years, we were able to preempt the plunderers,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Uncertain about its future, Afghanistan gets back smuggled relics from its past\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Precious relics of Afghanistan\u2019s ancient past are returning home even as the nation confronts deepening uncertainty about its future.\nA collection of 33 artifacts seized from a New York-based art dealer who authorities say was one of the world\u2019s most prolific smugglers of antiquities was turned over by the U.S. to the government of Afghanistan this week.\n\u201cThe significance of the material is huge,\u201d Roya Rahmani, the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., said Wednesday. \u201cEach one of these pieces are priceless depictions of our history.\u201d\nRahmani formally took control of the collection in a ceremony Monday in New York with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office and Homeland Security Investigations, which recovered the artifacts as part of a larger investigation into the trafficking of antiquities from a number of countries.\nNow, after briefly being displayed at the embassy in Washington, the masks, sculptures and other items, some from the 2nd and 3rd centuries, are en route to Kabul, where they are expected to go on display at the National Museum.\nIt\u2019s the same museum where members of the Taliban destroyed artifacts in 2001 as part of a cultural rampage rooted in a fundamentalist version of Islam, in which depictions of the human form are considered offensive.\nYoung Afghans fear losing new freedoms and their lives to the Taliban as U.S. troops prepare to exit.\nThe Taliban is now out of power. But it controls much of the country outside of Kabul amid stalled talks with the government and the looming withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces after two decades of war. Rahmani concedes it\u2019s a delicate time.\n\u201cHowever, what I know is that our security forces are determined to defend our people,\u201d she said in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cThe government is committed to do its part for peace and stability in a way that would bring durable peace.\u201d\nPresident Biden has said the U.S. would remove all its troops by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the attacks that prompted the American invasion to dislodge the Taliban in 2001 for allowing Al Qaeda to operate from Afghanistan.\nBefore the Sept. 11 attacks, the Taliban had already become internationally notorious for enforcing a harsh form of Islamic law that kept women out of public view and for destroying \u2014 with rockets, shells and dynamite \u2014 the famed giant, 6th century sandstone Buddha statues built into a cliff in Bamiyan province.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken makes an unannounced visit to Afghanistan to sell its leaders on President Biden\u2019s plan to withdraw all U.S. troops.\nRahmani says she wept when she first learned what the Taliban had done to the Buddha statues.\nBy contrast, the recovered antiquities are \u201creturning to a government and people who cherish their past\u201d and will make sure they are preserved for future generations, Rahmani said. She doesn\u2019t expect the Taliban, if they return to power, would dare to destroy them.\n\u201cOur security forces and our government would not let that happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are determined not to let that happen.\u201d\nLike the statues, some of the recovered antiquities depict Buddha. There\u2019s also a marble statue of the Hindu god Shiva and a Greek mask. The artifacts reflect the multicultural influences on Afghanistan, an important center of trade and commerce, according to Fredrik Hiebert, an archaeologist and National Geographic fellow who studies the country.\nMen on the border between Afghanistan and Iran have battled for centuries. Now a fight over water is brewing.\nThere are at least 2,600 archaeological sites around the country, said Hiebert, who helped authenticate some of the items after they had been confiscated by federal agents.\n\u201cAfghanistan is one of the richest countries in archaeology and history in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s very good reason, of course. For 6,000 years there\u2019s been civilization based in Afghanistan.\u201d\nThat also makes it an attractive target to looters, which is how the items eventually ended up in the United States.\nIn 2007, Homeland Security Investigations, an agency that deals with cases of smuggling that cross international borders, received information about looted artifacts brought to the New York area from India.\nIt eventually led to the indictment of a New York art gallery owner, Subhash Kapoor, and seven others, as well as the seizure of more than 2,600 artifacts, valued at more than $140 million. Kapoor is in jail in India and faces extradition to the U.S.\nIn the meantime, the U.S. government is working to repatriate the looted material, much of which was found in a series of raids on storage units in the New York area.\nThey have already returned relics to Nepal and Sri Lanka and soon will turn over artifacts to Thailand, said Stephen Lee, the supervisor special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations\u2019 cultural property, arts and antiquities unit. The 33 items being sent to Afghanistan, valued at around $1.8 million, are the first to go back there as part of this investigation.\n\u201cThey belong to the people of Afghanistan,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat\u2019s their cultural history.\u201d"
