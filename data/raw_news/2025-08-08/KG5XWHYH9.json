  "content": "United Airlines Flight 175 collides into the south tower of the World Trade Center as smoke billows from the north tower on Sept.11, 2001.\n\nThree 9/11 victims\u2019 remains have newly been identified, officials said this week, as evolving DNA technology keeps making gradual gains in the nearly quarter-century-long effort to return the remains of the dead to their loved ones.\n\nNew York City officials announced Thursday they had identified remains of Ryan D. Fitzgerald, a 26-year-old currency trader; Barbara A. Keating, a 72-year-old retired nonprofit executive; and another woman whose name authorities kept private at her family\u2019s request.\n\nThey were identified through now-improved DNA testing of minute remains found more than 20 years ago amid the wreckage of the World Trade Center after the al-Qaeda hijacked-plane attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the city medical examiner\u2019s office said.\n\n\u201cEach new identification testifies to the promise of science and sustained outreach to families despite the passage of time,\u201d chief medical examiner Dr. Jason Graham said in a statement. \u201cWe continue this work as our way of honoring the lost.\u201d\n\nKeating\u2019s son, Paul Keating, said he was amazed and impressed by the enduring endeavor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an amazing feat, gesture,\u201d he told the New York Post. He said genetic material from part of his mother\u2019s hairbrush was matched to DNA samples from relatives. A bit of his mother\u2019s ATM card was the only other trace of her ever recovered from the debris, he said.\n\nBarbara Keating was a passenger on Boston-to-Los Angeles-bound American Airlines Flight 11 when hijackers slammed it into the World Trade Center. She was headed home to Palm Springs, Calif., after spending the summer on Massachusetts\u2019 Cape Cod.\n\nKeating had spent her career in social services, including time as executive director of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of South Middlesex, near Boston. In retirement, she was involved in her Roman Catholic church in Palm Springs.\n\nFitzgerald, who lived in Manhattan, was working at a financial firm at the trade center, studying for a master\u2019s degree in business and talking about a long-term future with his girlfriend, according to obituaries published at the time.\n\nIn all, nearly 3,000 people were killed when the hijackers crashed jetliners into the trade center\u2019s twin towers, the Pentagon and a field in southwest Pennsylvania on 9/11. The vast majority of the victims, more than 2,700, perished at the trade center.\n\nThe New York medical examiner\u2019s office has steadily added to the roster of those with identified remains, most recently last year. The agency has tested and retested fragments as techniques advanced over the years and created new prospects for reading genetic code diminished by fire, sunlight, bacteria and more.\n\n\u201cWe hope the families receiving answers from the Office of Chief Medical Examiner can take solace in the city\u2019s tireless dedication to this mission,\u201d New York Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement Thursday.\n\nPeltz writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "U.S. doubles reward to $50 million for arrest of Maduro to face drug charges\n- Share via\nMIAMI \u2014 The Trump administration is doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world\u2019s largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, Maduro will not escape justice and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes,\u201d Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said Thursday in a video announcing the reward.\nMaduro was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. At the time, the U.S. offered a $15-million reward for his arrest. That was later raised by the Biden administration to $25 million \u2014 the same amount the U.S. offered for the capture of Osama bin Laden following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nDespite the big bounty, Maduro remains entrenched after defying the U.S., the European Union and several Latin American governments that condemned his 2024 reelection as a sham and recognized his opponent as Venezuela\u2019s duly elected president.\nLast month, the Trump administration struck a deal to secure the release of 10 Americans jailed in the capital, Caracas, in exchange for Venezuela getting home scores of migrants deported by the United States to El Salvador amid the current immigration crackdown. Shortly after, the White House reversed course and allowed U.S. oil producer Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela after it was previously blocked by U.S. sanctions.\nBondi said the Justice Department has seized more than $700 million in assets linked to Maduro, including two private jets, and said nearly 7 tons of seized cocaine had been traced directly to the leftist leader.\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil released a statement characterizing the reward as \u201cpathetic\u201d and accusing Bondi of orchestrating a \u201ccrude political propaganda operation.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised, coming from whom it comes from. The same one who promised a nonexistent \u2018secret list\u2019 of Epstein and who wallows in scandals for political favors,\u201d Gil said, referring to the backlash Bondi faced after the Justice Department announced last month that a long-rumored \u201cclient list\u201d of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein does not exist. \u201cHer show is a joke, a desperate distraction from her own misery.\u201d\nGoodman writes for the Associated Press. AP writer Regina Garcia Cano contributed to this report from Mexico City."

      "text": "- Share via\nSEOUL \u2014 For many Americans, the apartment where 29-year-old IT specialist Lee Chang-hee lives might be the stuff of nightmares.\nLocated just outside the capital of Seoul, the building isn\u2019t very tall \u2014 just 16 stories \u2014 by South Korean standards, but the complex consists of 36 separate structures, which are nearly identical except for the building number displayed on their sides.\nThe 2,000-plus units come in the same standardized dimensions found everywhere in the country (Lee lives in a \u201c84C,\u201d which has 84 square meters, or about 900 square feet, of floor space) and offer, in some ways, a ready-made life. The amenities scattered throughout the campus include a rock garden with a fake waterfall, a playground, a gym, an administration office, a senior center and a \u201cmoms cafe.\u201d\nBut this, for the most part, is South Korea\u2019s middle-class dream of homeownership \u2014 its version of a house with the white picket fence.\n\u201cThe bigger the apartment complex, the better the surrounding infrastructure, like public transportation, schools, hospitals, grocery stories, parks and so on,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI like how easy it is to communicate with the neighbors in the complex because there\u2019s a well-run online community.\u201d\nMost in the country would agree: Today, 64% of South Korean households live in such multifamily housing, the majority of them in apartments with five or more stories.\nSuch a reality seems unimaginable in cities like Los Angeles, which has limited or prohibited the construction of dense housing in single-family zones.\n\u201cLos Angeles is often seen as an endless tableau of individual houses, each with their own yard and garden,\u201d Max Podemski, an L.A.-based urban planner, wrote in The Times last year. \u201cApartment buildings are anathema to the city\u2019s ethos.\u201d\nIn recent years, the price of that ethos has become increasingly apparent in the form of a severe housing shortage. In the city of Los Angeles, where nearly 75% of all residential land is zoned for stand-alone single-family homes, rents have been in a seemingly endless ascent, contributing to one of the worst homelessness crises in the country. As a remedy, the state of California has ordered the construction of more than 450,000 new housing units by 2029.\nThe plan will almost certainly require the building of some form of apartment-style housing, but construction has lagged amid fierce resistance.\nSixty years ago, South Korea stood at a similar crossroads. But the series of urban housing policies it implemented led to the primacy of the apartment, and in doing so, transformed South Korean notions of housing over the course of a single generation.\nThe results of that program have been mixed. But in one important respect, at least, it has been successful: Seoul, which is half the size of the city of L.A., is home to a population of 9.6 million \u2014 compared with the estimated 3.3 million people who live here.\nFor Lee, the trade-off is a worthwhile one.\nIn an ideal world, she would have a garage for the sort of garage sales she\u2019s admired in American movies. \u201cBut South Korea is a small country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is necessary to use space as efficiently as possible.\u201d\nApartments, in her view, have spared her from the miseries of suburban housing. Restaurants and stores are close by. Easy access to public transportation means she doesn\u2019t need a car to get everywhere.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of my Korean need to have everything done quickly, but I think it\u2019d be uncomfortable to live somewhere that doesn\u2019t have these things within reach at all times,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to go out at night; I think it would be boring to have all the lights go off at 9 p.m.\u201d\nA general view shows steam rising from office and apartment buildings that define the Seoul skyline. (Ed Jones / AFP via Getty Images)\nApartment buildings light up in the evening as people return home from work in Seoul on March 25, 2021. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n::\nApartments first began appearing in South Korea in the 1960s and 1970s, as part of a government response to a housing crisis in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 a byproduct of the era\u2019s rapid industrialization and subsequent urban population boom.\nIn the 1960s, single-family detached dwellings made up around 95% of homes in the country. But over the following decade, as rural migrants flooded Seoul in search of factory work, doubling the population from 2.4 to 5.5 million, many in this new urban working class found themselves without homes. As a result, many of them settled in shantytowns on the city\u2019s outskirts, living in makeshift sheet-metal homes.\nThe authoritarian government at the time, led by a former army general named Park Chung-hee, declared apartments to be the solution and embarked on a building spree that would continue under subsequent administrations. Eased height restrictions and incentives for construction companies helped add between 20,000 to 100,000 new apartment units every year.\nThey were pushed by political leaders in South Korea as a high-tech modernist paradise, soon making them the most desirable form of housing for the middle and upper classes. Known as apateu, which specifically refers to a high-rise apartment building built as part of a larger complex \u2014 as distinct from lower stand-alone buildings \u2014 they symbolized Western cachet and upward social mobility.\n\u201cAround the late 1990s and early 2000s, almost every big-name celebrity at the time appeared in apartment commercials,\u201d recalled Jung Heon-mok, an anthropologist at the Academy of Korean Studies who has studied the history of South Korean apartments. \u201cBut the biggest reason that apartments proliferated as they did was because they were done at scale, in complexes of five buildings or more.\u201d\nEssential to the modern apateu are the amenities \u2014 such as on-site kindergartens or convenience stores \u2014 that allow them to function like miniature towns. This has also turned them into branded commodities and class signifiers, built by construction conglomerates like Samsung, and taking on names like \u201ccastle\u201d or \u201cpalace.\u201d (One of the first such branded apartment complexes was Trump Tower, a luxury development built in Seoul in the late 1990s by a construction firm that licensed the name of Donald Trump.)\nAll of this has made the detached single-family home, for the most part, obsolete. In Seoul, such homes now make up just 10% of the housing stock. Among many younger South Koreans like Lee, they are associated with retirement in the countryside, or, as she puts it: for \u201cgrilling in the garden for your grandkids.\u201d\n::\nThis model has not been without problems.\nThere are the usual issues that come with dense housing. In buildings with poor soundproofing, \u201cinter-floor noise\u201d between units is such a universal scourge that the government runs a noise-related dispute resolution center while discouraging people from angrily confronting their neighbors, a situation that occasionally escalates into headline-making violence.\nSome apartment buildings have proved to be too much even for a country accustomed to unsentimentally efficient forms of housing. One 19-story, 4,635-unit complex built by a big-name apartment brand in one of the wealthiest areas of Seoul looks so oppressive that it has become a curiosity, mocked by some as a prison or chicken coop.\nThe sheer number of apartments has prompted criticism of Seoul\u2019s skyline as sterile and ugly. South Koreans have described its uniform, rectangular columns as \u201cmatchboxes.\u201d And despite the aspirations attached to them, there is also a wariness about a culture where homes are built in such disposable, assembly line-like fashion.\nMany people here are increasingly questioning how this form of housing, with its nearly identical layouts, has shaped the disposition of contemporary South Korean society, often criticized by its own members as overly homogenized and lockstep.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that apartments have made South Koreans\u2019 lifestyles too similar,\u201d said Maing Pil-soo, an architect and urban planning professor at Seoul National University. \u201cAnd with similar lifestyles, you end up with a similar way of thinking. Much like the cityscape itself, everything becomes flattened and uniform.\u201d\nJung, the anthropologist, believes South Korea\u2019s apartment complexes, with their promise of an atomized, frictionless life, have eroded the more expansive social bonds that defined traditional society \u2014 like those that extended across entire villages \u2014 making its inhabitants more individualistic and insular.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, apartments here are undoubtedly extremely convenient \u2014 that\u2019s why they became so popular,\u201d he said. \u201cBut part of that convenience is because they insulate you from the concerns of the wider world. Once you\u2019re inside your complex and in your home, you don\u2019t have to pay attention to your neighbors or their issues.\u201d\nStill, Jung says this uniformity isn\u2019t all bad. It is what made them such easily scalable solutions to the housing crisis of decades past. It is also, in some ways, an equalizing force.\n\u201cI think apartments are partly why certain types of social inequalities you see in the U.S. are comparatively less severe in South Korea,\u201d he said.\nThough many branded apartment complexes now resemble gated communities with exclusionary homeowner associations, Jung points out that on the whole, the dominance of multifamily housing has inadvertently encouraged more social mixing between classes, a physical closeness that creates the sense that everyone is inhabiting the same broader space.\nEven Seoul\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods feel, to an extent that is hard to see in many American cities, porous and accessible. Wealthier often means having a nicer apartment, but an apartment all the same, existing in the same environs as those in a different price range.\n\u201cAnd even though we occasionally use disparaging terms like \u2018chicken coop\u2019 to describe them, once you actually step inside one of those apartments, they don\u2019t feel like that at all,\u201d Jung said. \u201cThey really are quite comfortable and nice.\u201d\n::\nPeople pose for photos among a field of cosmos flowers in front of high-rise apartment buildings in Goyang, west of Seoul. (Ed Jones / AFP via Getty Images)\nNone of this, however, has been able to stave off Seoul\u2019s own present-day housing affordability crisis.\nThe capital has one of the most expensive apartment prices in the world on a price-per-square-meter basis, ranking fourth after Hong Kong, Zurich and Singapore, and ahead of major U.S. cities like New York or San Francisco, according to a report published last month by Deutsche Bank. One especially brutal stretch recently saw apartment prices in Seoul double in four years.\nPart of the reason for this is that apartments, with their standardized dimensions, have effectively become interchangeable financial commodities: An apartment in Seoul is seen as a much more surefire bet than any stock, leading to intense real estate investment and speculation that has driven up home prices.\n\u201cBuying an apartment here isn\u2019t just buying an apartment. The equivalent in the U.S. would be like buying an ideal single-family home with a garage in the U.S., except that it comes with a bunch of NVIDIA shares,\u201d said Chae Sang-wook, an independent real estate analyst. \u201cIn South Korea, people invest in apateu for capital gains, not cash flow from rent.\u201d\nSome experts predict that, as the country enters another era of demographic upheaval, the dominance of apartments will someday be no more.\nIf births continue to fall as dramatically as they have done in recent years, South Koreans may no longer need such dense housing. The ongoing rise of single-person households, too, may chip away at a form of housing built to hold four-person nuclear families.\nBut Chae is skeptical that this will happen anytime soon. He points out that South Koreans don\u2019t even like to assemble their own furniture, let alone fix their own cars \u2014 all downstream effects of ubiquitous apartment living.\n\u201cFor now, there is no alternative other than this,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a South Korean, you don\u2019t have the luxury of choosing.\u201d"

      "text": "Air Force to deny retirement pay to transgender service members being separated from service\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Air Force said Thursday that it would deny all transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits. One Air Force sergeant said he was \u201cbetrayed and devastated\u201d by the move.\nThe move means that transgender service members will now be faced with the choice of either taking a lump-sum separation payment offered to junior troops or be removed from the service.\nAn Air Force spokesperson told the Associated Press that \u201calthough service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved.\u201d About a dozen service members had been \u201cprematurely notified\u201d that they would be able to retire before that decision was reversed, according to the spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal Air Force policy.\nA memo issued Monday announcing the new policy, which was reviewed by the AP, said that the choice to deny retirement benefits was made \u201cafter careful consideration of the individual applications.\u201d\nAll transgender members of the Air Force are being separated from the service under the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\nSeparation process has hit some bumps\nThe move comes after the Pentagon was given permission in early May by the Supreme Court to move forward with a ban on all transgender troops serving in the military. Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a policy that would offer currently openly serving transgender troops the option to either volunteer to leave and take a large, one-time separation payout or be involuntarily separated at later date.\nA Pentagon official told reporters in May that they viewed the policy as treating \u201canyone impacted by it with dignity and respect.\u201d\nHowever, in late July, transgender troops told Military.com that they were finding the entire separation process, which has included reverting their service records back to their birth gender, \u201cdehumanizing\u201d or \u201copen cruelty.\u201d\nShannon Leary, a lawyer who represents LGBTQ+ people in employment discrimination cases, says she expects lawsuits to challenge Thursday\u2019s decision. \u201cIt seems quite arbitrary on its face and cruel,\u201d she said. \u201cThese military members have dedicated their lives to serving our country.\u201d\nNormally, Leary said, when early retirement is offered in the military, it\u2019s available to all members who have served over 15 years. She said she expects other service branches to follow the Air Force\u2019s path.\nOne Air Force service member says he\u2019s \u2018devastated\u2019\nLogan Ireland, a master sergeant in the U.S. Air Force who has 15 years of service, including a deployment to Afghanistan, is one of the airmen impacted by the policy. \u201cI feel betrayed and devastated by the news,\u201d he said.\nIreland said he learned that his retirement was being denied Wednesday when his chain of command, \u201cwith tears in their eyes,\u201d told him the news.\nOfficials have said that as of Dec. 9, 2024, there were 4,240 troops diagnosed with \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d on active duty, and in the National Guard and Reserve. Pentagon officials have decided to use the condition and its diagnosis as the main way to identify troops who are trans.\nHowever, the two are not an exact match \u2014 not every transgender person has the condition. As a result, there is an understanding that the actual number of transgender people within the military\u2019s roughly 2 million troops may be higher.\nUnder the latest policy, active duty troops had until June 6 to voluntarily identify themselves and receive a payout while troops in the National Guard and Reserve had until July 7. Pentagon officials previously told reporters that they plan to lean on commanders and existing annual medical screenings to find any transgender service members who do not come forward.\nToropin writes for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Remains of 3 more 9/11 victims ID\u2019d as NYC praised for still working to give families closure 24 years later\nThe remains of three more 9/11 victims have been identified \u2013 as one family praised the city for \u201cworking their ass off\u201d 24 years after the horrific terrorist attacks.\nFloral Park resident Ryan Fitzgerald and Palm Springs, California grandmother Barbara Keating were positively ID\u2019d \u2013 as well as an adult woman whose family did not want her name released publicly, officials announced Thursday.\nThe Office of Chief Medical Examiner used advanced DNA testing and family outreach to ID the remains \u2014 the 1,651st, 1,652nd and 1,653rd victims officially identified since the attacks.\nFitzgerald, 26, was working as a foreign currency trader at Fiduciary Trust International in the south tower when a hijacked plane crashed into it while Keating, a 72-year-old grandmother, was on American Airlines Flight 11 that left Boston shortly before it spiraled into the north tower.\nKeating\u2019s son Paul Keating, 61, commended the staff at the medical examiner\u2019s office for \u201cstill working their ass off\u201d all these years later, saying \u201cthey won\u2019t rest for us.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how to react to that. It\u2019s just an amazing feat, gesture \u2013 it\u2019s more than that because they\u2019ve been doing it as their life for 24 years,\u201d Paul Keating, 61, told The Post.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about moving six blocks of Manhattan to Staten Island and going through it milligram by milligram for 24 years,\u201d he added in reference to the wreckage moved to Fresh Kills in the aftermath. \u201cI mean, isn\u2019t that amazing to you. No one\u2019s ever done something like that for me, my family ever and I couldn\u2019t thank them enough.\u201d\nPaul Keating said city officials were in touch with he and his four siblings soon after the unthinkable day changed New York and the nation. The beloved matriarch was among 2,753 people killed in lower Manhattan.\nFirst authorities found a \u201ctiny piece\u201d of her ATM card in checked-in luggage about 20 years ago, then found part of her hairbrush that was ultimately matched to her a few years ago after two of children submitted DNA, he said.\nHe said the medical examiner\u2019s office reached out again about positively matching the remains three months ago before receiving confirmation around a month ago.\nBarbara Keating had spent the summer months on Cape Cod before returning home to California, and always took a cross-country flight the second Tuesday of each September, her son said.\nShe led a chapter of Big Brothers, Big Sisters, and was also the director of an agency in Massachusetts that helped the mentally disabled. In retirement, she worked for her local Catholic church in Palm Springs.\n\u201cShe was an awesome grandmother,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAll the kids adored her.\u201d\nFitzgerald, a loving son and brother to two sisters, called family after the first plane hit the north tower to tell them he was OK and about to leave his office, according to a Newsday report.\nThe oldest of three children, he had just moved into Manhattan and spent the summer at a bachelor party in Las Vegas, buying new clothes at Banana Republic and gifts for his girlfriend and enjoying the familiar restaurants downtown, his mother told the New York Times in November 2001.\n\u201cIt made me feel good that he enjoyed the summer because it was the last summer of his life,\u201d mother Diane Parks said at the time.\nFitzgerald\u2019s identity was confirmed through remains recovered in 2002 while Keating\u2019s ID and the third undisclosed victim were linked to remains found in 2011, the medical examiner\u2019s office said.\n\u201cThe pain of losing a loved one in the September 11th terror attacks echoes across the decades, but with these three new identifications, we take a step forward in comforting the family members still aching from that day,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement.\n\u201cAs a former law enforcement officer who served our city on 9/11, I understand deeply the feeling of loss so many families have experienced. We hope the families receiving answers from the Office of Chief Medical Examiner can take solace in the city\u2019s tireless dedication to this mission.\u201d\nBig Apple officials said about 1,100 victims, which amounts to 40% of those who perished in the sickening attack, have yet to be officially identified.\nChief Medical Examiner Dr. Jason Graham vowed to continue to work on identifying 9/11 victims.\n\u201cEach new identification testifies to the promise of science and sustained outreach to families despite the passage of time,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe continue this work as our way of honoring the lost.\u201d"
