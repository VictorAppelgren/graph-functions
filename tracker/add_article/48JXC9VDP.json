Both companies exhibit strong growth prospects, moat, and long‑term potential, positioning them as attractive “forever stocks.” The article highlights Microsoft’s significant contracted revenue, cloud dominance over Amazon, and robust cash flow, while noting Shopify’s expanding U.S. e‑commerce market share and network effects.
