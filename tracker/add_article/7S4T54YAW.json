      "summary": "The article reports that 23 U.S. states have enacted or expanded laws restricting the mass collection of biometric data, with recent examples in Colorado, Texas, and Oregon requiring consent and banning sales of facial or voice data. High-profile tech firms such as Google, Meta, and Clearview AI have paid combined settlements totaling $1.4 billion to Texas and other states for unauthorized data mining. Illinois’s 2008 Biometric Information Privacy Act stands out by granting a private right of action, yet enforcement remains limited, especially against foreign companies like PimEyes that evade U.S. jurisdiction. Federal efforts to impose nationwide biometric protections have stalled, leaving state laws as the primary defense against pervasive facial‑recognition surveillance.",
