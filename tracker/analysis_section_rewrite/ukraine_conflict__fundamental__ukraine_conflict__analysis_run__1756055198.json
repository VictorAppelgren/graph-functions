      "feedback": "Strong: the draft rightly grounds a multi-year, structural view in concrete, large-number war costs (Russia’s 2025 drone campaign ~$5.7B and total aerial campaign ~$13.4B; Ukraine’s long-range drone push ~14,000 drones with ~3,300 in July; 48 Neptune, 29 Storm Shadow) and flags the Alaska meeting as the key hinge; it ties these to intensified production and sanctions leverage. To reach world-class caliber, deliver a formal regime map and a first-principles anchor set, then tighten the causal chain to market pricing. Edits: (1) add explicit invariant anchors (first principles) such as real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity/defense-capital shock, BoP/external position, and a simple policy-reaction-function framing for US/EU sanctions; state regime definitions (Regime A: credible Alaska framework with sanctions relief and lower risk premia; Regime B: stalemate with persistent elevated risk premia; Regime C: escalation with higher premia and growth drag) and the transition conditions between them (e.g., explicit Alaska readout, progress on ceasefire/territorial talks, or new sanctions rounds). (2) specify a clear causal chain from the war-cost structure to external financing conditions and market pricing: drone/missile outlays constrain fiscal space; sanctions alter sovereign risk and risk premia; European and US policy tweaks feed into external balance and funding costs, which then show up in asset pricing and growth. (3) concretize the base case and scenarios with quantified triggers, not hedged prose: Base case should state a probability-weighted outcome (e.g., “Alaska delivers a framework within Q4 2025 that could modestly ease risk premia,” versus “no breakthrough and sanctions tighten further”); outline three scenarios with primary catalysts (Alaska outcome, sanctions announcements, drone activity spikes) and associated market implications (sovereign yields, USD/EUR, and risk assets). (4) deepen the quantification use: present the costs and flows as explicit inputs to external/ fiscal balances (e.g., Russia’s ~$13.4B 2025 campaign as a drag on fiscal space; Ukraine’s weaponization growth offset by external assistance and higher production), and quantify the relief path if sanctions ease (e.g., potential compression of geopolitical risk premia by a few basis points or a qualitative shift in the risk premium regime). (5) tighten citations and consistency: use a single primary source for fact-attribution (DK94SSAEY) and, where numbers differ marginally in the duplicates (Y7HBFNT8M), consolidate to avoid double-counting; after each anchor or important factual claim, place the ID in parentheses. (6) add explicit “what to watch” and “invalidation” criteria: watch Alaska readouts, new sanction rounds, casualty/equipment-flow shifts, and Kyiv/Moscow production trajectories; invalidation anchors include failure to produce a credible framework within a defined window or a surprising policy reversal that keeps risk premia elevated; (7) ensure alignment with the horizon/style by presenting a concise base-case, clearly defined risks, a watch-list with concrete data points, and a transparent confidence assessment (e.g., “moderate under Alaska hinge but high uncertainty due to negotiation durability”).",
