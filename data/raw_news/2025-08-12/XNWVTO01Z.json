  "title": "Sidelined from Trump-Putin talks, Ukraine warns the world not to trust Russia",
  "description": "Ukraine has been left out in the cold ahead of high-profile talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin on Friday.",
  "content": "US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, Feb. 28, 2025.\n\nSidelined from forthcoming talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to the war, Ukraine has warned the world that Moscow is not to be trusted and is planning new offensives.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said intelligence and military officials had briefed him on Monday \"on what Putin is counting on and what he is actually preparing for,\" saying \"this includes military preparations.\"\n\n\"He is certainly not preparing to cease fire or end the war,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.\n\n\"There is not a single sign that the Russians have been told to prepare for a post-war situation \u2013 not yet. On the contrary, they are moving their troops and forces in ways that indicate they plan to launch new offensive operations. No one preparing for peace acts this way,\" he added.\n\n\"Putin's sole aim is to present a meeting with America as his personal victory and then continue acting as before, putting pressure on Ukraine as before,\" the president warned. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to Zelenskyy's claims and is awaiting a response.\n\nThe problem for Ukraine is whether anyone is listening.\n\nNeither Zelenskyy nor European officials are invited to the Trump-Putin talks in Alaska on Friday, much to their consternation.\n\nUkraine has vehemently stated that no deal about its future can be struck in its absence, amid fears that it could be forced to cede Russian-occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. European leaders, meanwhile, are pushing strongly for Ukraine's involvement in the talks. The U.S., for its part, has said it is considering inviting Zelenskyy, NBC News reported.",

Right now, the White House is focusing on planning the bilateral meeting requested by President Putin.\u201d\nThe Ukrainian government did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrump announced Friday that he is meeting with Putin on Aug. 15 in Alaska as he tries to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially made a Putin meeting with Zelenskyy a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition.\nIf Zelenskyy were to travel to Alaska, it is not clear whether he and Putin would ever be in the same room, one of the people briefed on the discussions said.\nThe surge in diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine comes after Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow ahead of a deadline on Friday that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions.\nPutin has not agreed to a ceasefire but proposed the outlines of an agreement to end the war that would allow Russia to keep large swaths of Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy said defiantly on Saturday that Ukrainians \u201cwill not give their land to occupiers.\u201d\nTrump said Friday that between Russia and Ukraine, \u201cthere\u2019ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.\u201d Zelenskyy and his European allies have said that ceding territory would only encourage Russian aggression.\nAdministration officials were working on Saturday to try to gain support for a potential ceasefire from the Ukrainian government and European leaders.\nIn a joint statement on Saturday, European leaders welcomed the Trump-Putin meeting but emphasized the need to keep pressure on Russia and protect the security interests of Ukraine and Europe as a whole.\n\u201cWe remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations.\u201d\nThe statement from the leaders of France, Britain, Italy, Germany, Poland and Finland, as well as European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, said that meaningful negotiations could take place only in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities and that \u201cthe path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d\nZelenskyy said Ukraine \u201cvalues and fully supports\u201d the European leaders\u2019 statement.\n\u201cThe end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for the sake of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests of our European nations,\u201d he said Sunday in a post on X."
