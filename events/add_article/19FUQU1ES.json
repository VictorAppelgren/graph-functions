      "summary": "The article highlights a $35,000 average cost to hire a software developer amid rising résumé fraud and a severe Web3 developer shortage, with only 23,000 active Web3 developers versus 29 million in traditional tech. It discusses how AI‑Web3 convergence is creating new skill demands and how platforms like HackQuest use on‑chain credential verification and hackathons to reduce hiring costs to $5–10 k and accelerate talent pipelines. The piece underscores the broader trend of rapid, AI‑driven innovation events (vibathons, hackathons) reshaping talent acquisition and product development in the tech ecosystem.",
