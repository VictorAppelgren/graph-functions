  "title": "Plan for 142 ownership units at Costa Mesa's TBN building ratified by council, with edits",
  "description": "Meritage Homes wants to build 122 townhouses and 20 detached homes at 3150 Bear St. But a plan for a pedestrian gate near existing homes was removed by the City Council at neighbors' behest.",
  "content": "The project includes 122 stacked-flat townhomes and 20 detached single-family homes on the 6.12-acre parcel at 3150 Bear St. that was previously the home of Trinity Broadcasting.\n\nThe Costa Mesa City Council Tuesday approved a proposal to build 142 residential units at the former Trinity Broadcasting Network headquarters, a plan that did not sit well with neighbors, who demanded \u2014 and were granted \u2014 some last-minute edits.\n\nA proposal by Meritage Homes to build 122 stacked-flat townhomes and 20 detached single-family homes on the 6.12-acre parcel at 3150 Bear St., just south of the 405 Freeway, was approved by planning commissioners in a July 24 meeting.\n\nPrior to that, in September 2024, the City Council reviewed the initial details of the plan in a general plan amendment screening, advising the applicant to think more about open space, sidewalks and street safety upgrades as well as improvements to the city\u2019s Shiffer Park, to the west of the site across Bear Street.\n\nPlanning commissioners credited the plan for providing more ownership housing in Costa Mesa, where 60% of the populace rent their dwellings and where the high demand for housing, and the costs thereof, are skyrocketing with no end in sight. Meritage will also designate seven units for very low income occupants.\n\nThe new complex aims to provide housing for \u201cthe missing middle,\u201d a segment of the population looking to move beyond renting but who cannot yet afford single-family homes, by offering townhouses that allow buyers to build equity, then move up the housing pyramid.\n\nCity officials also found favor with Meritage\u2019s promise to proffer a one-time payment of $250,000 for improvements to Shiffer Park, on top of the city\u2019s developer and impact fees. And while the 319 parking spots, including two-car garages for every unit and 35 guest spots, is lower than what the city would require for a project of that size, that exceeds the 236 stalls required by the state for density bonus housing projects.\n\nThroughout both the prior public airings, Meritage pitched a signalized intersection on Bear, at the southwestern corner entrance of the property, and a pedestrian gate at the northeast corner, near Olympic Boulevard, that would offer new residents safe access to nearby amenities while offering neighbors a shortcut through the development to Shiffer Park.\n\nCurrent residents consistently turned out at those meetings to vociferously oppose the pedestrian gate, which they said would effectively turn existing residential streets into an overflow parking lot for new residents. They reiterated those concerns at Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\n\nValerie Stokes lives on nearby Yellowstone Drive with her husband and 4-year-old son. She described families with small kids walking and biking to play dates and Shiffer Park, who already must contend with traffic on Bear. The situation, she said, would only be made worse by more cars and more people.\n\n\u201cThis gate would bring significant foot traffic into our quiet, safe neighborhood and threaten the sense of security we\u2019ve worked hard to build,\u201d Stokes told the council. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification for it, and our small community shouldn\u2019t have to suffer to become a back entrance for this complex.\u201d\n\nHousing advocate Elizabeth Hansburg, executive director of People for Housing Orange County, shared her enthusiastic support for the proposal.\n\n\u201cThis project is housing for the next generation,\u201d she said, describing Stokes\u2019 picture of residential harmony as a vision that Meritage occupants want for themselves. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason to think this new community will not be that for those future residents.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing more than an hour of public commentary, Mayor Pro Tem Manuel Chavez proposed approving the project but eliminating the pedestrian gate on Olympic, out of deference to the existing neighbors, while eschewing other complaints about the 52-foot height of the townhomes and increased vehicle traffic.\n\n\u201cThe developer has intentionally chosen to build single-family homes adjacent to existing homes in an attempt to mitigate that height,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s very reasonable to remove [gate] access on Olympic that you guys have told me you don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nCouncilmember Arlis Reynolds attempted to make revisions and amendments that would allow the gate to remain open during park hours, attempting in a substitute motion to implement limited or timed access and a parking study should parking thresholds be breached.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a way to balance the very, very valid concerns we heard here tonight with plans that allow for more connectivity and safer movement for people, families and kids, walking and biking to parks, schools, restaurants and so on,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, those attempts failed, and Reynolds\u2019 substitute motion failed due to a lack of support. Her desire to implement pedestrian-friendly modifications to the signalized intersection and traffic calming measures south of Shiffer Park were approved.\n\nCouncilmember Loren Gameros also offered friendly amendments to Chavez\u2019s original motion, suggesting that the city take steps to ensure neighbors living further down on Bear would not see their egress blocked by traffic at the signal and getting clarity that, were parking to become an issue, the council could consider overriding a prohibition for residential permit parking in the area.\n\nAhead of the 6-0 vote, Mayor John Stephens supported the project, which would replace an underutilized property with needed housing, while improving the nearby entrance and Shiffer Park.\n\n\u201cIt might impact the neighbors a little bit, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an undue impact,\u201d he added. \u201c[And] the housing that\u2019s provided outweighs the concerns I\u2019ve heard, in my mind.\u201d",

      "text": "Plan for 142 housing units at Trinity Broadcasting Network HQ blessed by commission\n- Share via\nA plan to build 142 townhouses and single family residences on what once served as headquarters for the Trinity Broadcasting Network will soon ascend to the Costa Mesa City Council after a recent blessing from city planning commissioners.\nCommissioners reviewed the proposal, put forth by developer Meritage Homes Irvine office, to fully build out the 6.12-acre parcel, located at 3150 Bear Street, just south of the 405 Freeway.\nInitially reviewed by the Costa Mesa City Council in September, the plan includes 20 detached family homes along the southern and eastern sides of the property, with 122 stacked flats of varying configurations toward the center and a single vehicle access point at Bear across from the city\u2019s Shiffer Park.\nIf approved, the project would provide roughly 2.13 acres of public and private open space, including rooftop balconies on some units and private backyards in the single family homes. The applicant has also agreed to pay the city $250,000 for park improvements of the park.\nA second access point, onto the residential Olympic Avenue at the northeast corner of the site, would be open only to pedestrians and emergency vehicles, and would allow existing residents to the east to cut through the Meritage project to get to Shiffer Park.\nCommissioners in a July 14 meeting considered several entitlements for the proposal, including a general plan amendment to transition and rezone the property from commercial use to high-density residential. The property qualifies for rezoning under Costa Mesa\u2019s Measure K.\nIn exchange for a state density bonus \u2014 and the additional 20 units that would allow \u2014 Meritage has agreed to designate seven residences for very-low income owners. Each unit would have a two-car, tandem parking garage, while the site would provide an additional 35 guest parking spaces.\nVanessa Scheidel, a project manager for the Irvine office, told commissioners the development will create an opportunity to provide \u201cmissing middle housing\u201d for young families and individuals seeking to transition from a rental scenario, but who may not yet be able to afford a single-family home.\n\u201cThe stacked flats proposed for Bear Street are designed to offer a middle ground between apartments and traditional, row-style townhomes to provide a greater affordability and an opportunity for first-time homebuyers,\u201d Scheidel said.\nAt least a dozen residents, most of them residing in homes surrounding the TBN property, shared their concerns of increased car traffic on Bear Street and the possibility that the new site would result in overflow parking from residents and their guests.\nResident John Frazier said streets in the area were already burdened with overflow parking from nearby developments, as neighborhoods are situated in between South Coast Plaza, Metro Pointe and areas that provide no residential parking.\n\u201cNow what\u2019s being proposed is \u2018pedestrian access\u2019 back into our neighborhood. That\u2019s clearly a guise of additional access to the park \u2014 it\u2019s really additional parking for the [Meritage] community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are stressed to the max with parking, and we cannot have pedestrian access or egress into our neighborhood.\u201d\nOther residents complained the proposed stacked townhomes, towering at 52 feet, would overshadow the surrounding one-story homes and negatively impact the area.\n\u201cWhen we purchased our home some 20 years ago we had a degree of privacy in the backyard. That will completely disappear with this mammoth structure,\u201d said Charles Chappell, whose property sits adjacent to the project side. \u201cThe next thing to disappear will be our property value \u2014 who wants to purchase a home that backs to a 52-foot structure?\u201d\nCommissioners, however, supported the Meritage plan, indicating the detached homes along the perimeter of the property would provide a more than 100-foot buffer between existing homes and the townhouses.\nThey further praised the signalized intersection near the vehicle entrance and enhanced access for current neighbors to Shiffer Park, along with the rare opportunity of a developer providing an ownership opportunity for seven very-low income households.\n\u201cWe are in a housing crisis. We, quite simply, need more housing, and that is what this project proposes,\u201d said Commissioner David Martinez. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ve ever done for-sale affordable units before \u2014 that\u2019s amazing to see we\u2019re providing that opportunity for very-low income families to be able to own a home.\u201d\nCommissioner Angely Andrade Vallarta said the project provided an option for renters, who account for 60% of Costa Mesa\u2019s population, a chance to own a home inside the city.\n\u201cAs a city, we need to respond to our larger community,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it might just be an opportunity to be open to providing the opportunities that many [current] property owners have had, to provide that to the generation that is following us right behind you.\u201d\nWith 5-0 approval by the commission (Vice Chair Jon Zich and Commissioner Rob Dickson were absent), the proposal could go before the City Council as soon as Aug. 5."
