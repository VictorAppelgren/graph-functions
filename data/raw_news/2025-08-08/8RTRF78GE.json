  "content": "President Trump aims to stop \u201cwasteful grantmaking\u201d by signing an executive order that requires his appointees to review grants to make sure they benefit Americans.\n\nThe order signed Thursday directs political appointees and subject matter experts to review each grant to make sure it\u2019s helpful and not just \u201clining grantees\u2019 pocketbooks or furthering causes that damage America.\u201d\n\nA fact sheet of the order said award decisions will \u201cundergo more rigorous evaluation by political appointees and subject matter experts to ensure they benefit the American public, align with Administration priorities, and are coordinated across agencies to avoid duplication.\u201d\n\nThe order aims to cancel future grants that don\u2019t meet proper criteria.\n\nThe White House cites examples of federal funds misused, like training doctoral candidates in critical race theory, grants going toward diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and \u201cother anti-American ideologies in the classroom, masked as rigorous and thoughtful investigation.\u201d\n\nIt also pointed to \u201charm imposed by problematic federal grants\u201d like gain-of-function research, which gained criticism with its connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn short, there is a strong need to strengthen oversight and coordination of, and to streamline, agency grantmaking to address these problems, prevent them from recurring, and ensure greater accountability for use of public funds more broadly. The Government holds tax revenue in trust for the American people, and agencies should treat it accordingly,\u201d the order said.\n\nThe fact sheet of the order says grants must be simplified in plain language and awarded to \u201ca wide array of meritorious grantees, not just the universities and nonprofits that have received awards year after year.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cFederal grant money should be awarded based on a grantee\u2019s ability to produce results, not based on its ability to hire lawyers and grant-writing experts.\u201d\n\nThis order is a continuation of the president\u2019s push to remove wasteful spending from the government and make sure policies align with his agenda.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency was created to slash federal funding in the government by cutting contracts and grants. Mr. Trump has also signed orders to ensure that nongovernmental organizations advance only U.S. interests and that government funds don\u2019t go toward anything that promotes DEI and other \u201canti-American\u201d ideology.\n\nThe president has clashed with numerous universities, including Harvard and Columbia, for their teaching of DEI and critical race theory and antisemitic treatment of Jewish students.\n\nHe signed a memorandum Thursday that orders institutions of higher education to provide admissions data to make sure affirmative action is not taking place.",

  "summary": "President Trump has signed an executive order directing his appointees to review grants to ensure they benefit Americans and align with his agenda. The order aims to cancel future grants that don't meet proper criteria and prevent misuse of federal funds. Examples cited include training doctoral candidates in critical race theory, grants going toward diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and anti-American ideologies in classrooms. The White House also highlighted examples of problematic federal grants like gain-of-function research. The fact sheet of the order stated that grant money should be awarded based on a grantee's ability to produce results, not its ability to hire lawyers and grant-writing experts. This move follows President Trump's push to remove wasteful spending from the government and ensure policies align with Trump's agenda.",
