      "feedback": "Overall, your 3–6 month frame is on the right track, but the piece would be world-class with a crisper causal chain, sharper timing, tighter use of numbers, and a fully-reconciled citation map anchored to the provided sources. Strengths: you link policy (the big, beautiful bill and tariffs) to manufacturing bets (GM’s $4B US capex, Cadillac’s Elevated Velocity) and to EV/automation themes, and you bring in private-market signals (Pacaso, mogul, Range) to illustrate flows and optionality. But the causal chain is loose and the timing is vague, and several claims would benefit from tighter quantification and explicit scenario structure. Concrete edit instructions to upgrade to world-class quality:\n\n- Rebuild as a true 3–6 month scenario map with explicit timing windows and path-dependency. For example: Window 1 (0–6 weeks): policy clarity on OB BBA/tariffs; Window 2 (1–2 quarters): GM cadence on capex and plant outlays; Window 3 (6–24 weeks): auto-pricing/lead-gen responses from dealers to tariff news; Window 4 (3–6 months): consumer demand signals (EV/hybrid mix, used-vehicle shift). Tie each window to a trigger and an invalidation signal.\n\n- Tighten the base case and add two clear alts with numeric anchors. Base case: modest macro momentum with EV/mfg lift; Alt A: tariff escalation or slower debt relief raises rates and tears into margins; Alt B: policy compromise or faster AI-driven productivity (Range-style) lifting inflation and growth. For each scenario, specify a base-case range for at least one key variable (e.g., GM capex cadence: $10–12B through 2027 but flowing in 2025–2026; EV share in U.S. vehicle mix; ISM manufacturing readings; or private-capflow signals from Pacaso/mogul). Quote or reference precise figures (e.g., “OBBBA is a $3.4T package with $1.2T in spending cuts” from EPJYXB7DX/Whatley pieces; “25% tariff on all imported passenger vehicles” from WT sources; “GM annual capex cadence $10–12B through 2027” from D4). Then map how each scenario would alter Cadillac/Luxury EV demand, dealer pricing, and private-market funding.\n\n- Build a coherent causal chain from policy to market/operating outcomes. A suggested chain: policy/tariffs and debt dynamics drive rates and consumer price inflation; higher rates pressure new-vehicle demand but subsidize used-vehicle demand; GM/Cadillac respond with U.S.-based manufacturing and premium EV storytelling (Elevated Velocity) to defend ASPs; AI productivity (Range/Mogul) improves margins and accelerates capital-light growth; private-market platforms (Pacaso, mogul) add alternative-asset inflation hedges and liquidity channels that can cushion cyclicals; this yields a net path for equities and real assets under a higher debt environment. Explicitly cite Range (productivity + 1–1.5% GDP impulse if realized) and Pacaso/mogul metrics as separate channels rather than aggregate gloss.\n\n- Quantify and reconcile numbers from sources; replace generic statements with specific figures or ranges. Use: OB BBA package size (3.4T/1.2T cuts) and debt implications; tariff proposal (25% on all imported passenger vehicles); GM capex cadence (10–12B through 2027; Orion/Spring Hill/Factory ZERO production shifts); Cadillac Elevated Velocity specs as example of premium EV/tech trajectory; Pacaso’s $1.3T vacation-home market, 21% annual co-ownership growth, 10%+ home-value appreciation; Range AI platform claims (range of clients, $6B+ assets, 0% AUM in some tiers); HeartSciences AI-ECG clinical validation if you bring in the 32B market context. Maintain source integrity by citing only IDs present (WTNT85IPR for Cadillac/GM/US manufacturing; EPJYXB7DX and Whatley pieces for RNC/policy framing; UPV3X2MQ6 for Barista FIRE/Range/Pacaso/mogul; ILYC1M41F for Barista FIRE; V8TEZOR8R for tires as a risk/conditioning anchor; HeartSciences if you tilt toward healthcare tech signaling).\n\n- Strengthen the watch-list signals and invalidations. Add concrete invalidation criteria such as: if 6–8 week tariff news indicates escalation beyond 25%, if 12–16 week policy reallocation worsens the fiscal trajectory (debt/GDP rising beyond ~100–120%), if private-market liquidity tightens (e.g., VC/late-stage funding freezes affecting Pacaso/mogul), or if AI-productivity signals under Range fail to materialize meaningfully (less than 0.5–1.0% incremental productivity). Specify concrete data to watch: ISM prints, auto-lease/pricing data, GM output/shift data, tariff-commentary cadence, and private-market fundraising momentum.\n\n- Tighten the narrative to match SECTION FOCUS on horizon/style. Define a single base-case forecast with a short, sharp narrative (one paragraph) plus two crisp alts (each with 2–3 bullets) and a dedicated list of watch signals and invalidations. End with a concise confidence assessment (e.g., high confidence in EV-capex-driven domestic capacity, tempered by tariff and debt-risk uncertainties).\n\n- Clean up citations and ensure every factual claim maps to an IDs-only citation. Remove any non-ID mentions (e.g., stray “GM” tag) and attach after each claim the exact IDs: policy claims to EPJYXB7DX/Whatley; Cadillac/GM capex to WTNT85IPR; tariff risk to WTNT85IPR or EPJYXB7DX; Range/Pacaso/mogul to UPV3X2MQ6; private-market diversification to ILYC1M41F; healthcare AI to HeartSciences as appropriate (ILYC1M41F); tires/backstop risk to V8TEZOR8R if you discuss consumer durability risk.\n\nIf you implement these edits, you’ll deliver a tight, defensible, numerically grounded 3–6 month scenario with explicit triggers, timing, and invalidations, all anchored to the IDs you’ve got in SOURCE MATERIAL and arranged in a transparent base-case-plus-alts format.",
