  "content": "WTF?! The UK is in the middle of a drought, and the government is asking citizens to do their part to help. In addition to taking the usual steps to alleviate the water shortage, the government is asking people to delete their old emails and pictures.\n\nThe UK is experiencing the kind of consistent hot and dry weather rarely seen in a country with summer temperatures averaging between 48\u00b0F and 64\u00b0F \u2013 the last six months leading to July have been its driest since 1976.\n\nThe water shortfall situation has now become a \"nationally significant incident.\" Five areas are officially in a drought, and six more are going through prolonged dry weather.\n\nThe UK's National Drought Group (NDG) has therefore issued guidance on how to save water at home. It includes the usual advice such as not watering lawns, taking shorter showers, fixing leaky toilets, and generally not being wasteful, but something we've never seen before is the suggestion to \"delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.\"\n\nBeing told to clear out one's inbox to save water is certainly causing a lot of controversy. Data centers do use a lot of water through evaporative cooling \u2013 the current global footprint is estimated at around 560 billion liters per year.\n\nHowever, it's highly unlikely that Brits deleting their unwanted emails and pictures is going to make much of a difference, especially as the storage devices in these centers create little heat once the data is stored. It's noted that searching for old data from your cloud backups could actually use more energy and water in the short term than leaving them alone. There's also the possibility that the data center storing your files is located in another country.\n\nSomething that could do more to save water is for the UK to ease up on its use of generative AI. According to an environmental report published by French model builder Mistral AI, a 400 token response \u2013 about a page worth of text \u2013 consumed about 45 ml of water and generated about 1.14 grams of CO2e. When millions of people are using these AI tools, that adds up to a lot of water. Ironically, the UK government has been praising AI and committed to growing its use in the country.",

      "text": "Our contribution to a global environmental standard for AI\nAt Mistral AI, our mission is to bring artificial intelligence in everyone\u2019s hands. For this purpose, we have consistently advocated for openness in AI, with a unique focus on empowering organizations that want to own their AI future.\nToday, as AI becomes increasingly integrated into every layer of our economy, it is crucial for developers, policymakers, enterprises, governments and citizens to better understand the environmental footprint of this transformative technology. At Mistral AI, we believe that we share a collective responsibility with each actor of the value chain to address and mitigate the environmental impacts of our innovations.\nEven though some recent initiatives have been taken, such as the Coalition for Sustainable AI, launched during the Paris AI Action Summit in February 2025, the work to achieve here remains important. Without more transparency, it will be impossible for public institutions, enterprises and even users to compare models, take informed purchasing decisions, fill enterprises' extra-financial obligations or reduce the impacts associated with their use of AI.\nIn this context, we have conducted a first-of-its-kind comprehensive study to quantify the environmental impacts of our LLMs. This report aims to provide a clear analysis of the environmental footprint of AI, contributing to set a new standard for our industry.\nThe first comprehensive lifecycle analysis of an AI models\nAfter less than 18 months of existence, we have initiated the first comprehensive lifecycle analysis (LCA) of an AI model, in collaboration with Carbone 4, a leading consultancy in CSR and sustainability, and the French ecological transition agency (ADEME). To ensure robustness, this study was also peer-reviewed by Resilio and Hubblo, two consultancies specializing in environmental audits in the digital industry.\nIn addition to complying with the most rigorous standards*, the aim of this analysis was to quantify the environmental impacts of developing and using LLMs across three impact categories: greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), water use, and resource depletion**. Today, we are disclosing two important metrics for our industry in the long term:\n-\nthe environmental footprint of training Mistral Large 2: as of January 2025, and after 18 months of usage, Large 2 generated the following impacts:\n-\n20,4 ktCO\u2082e,\n-\n281 000 m3 of water consumed,\n-\nand 660 kg Sb eq (standard unit for resource depletion).\n-\nthe marginal impacts of inference, more precisely the use of our AI assistant Le Chat for a 400-token response - excluding users\u2019 terminals:\n-\n1.14 gCO\u2082e,\n-\n45 mL of water,\n-\nand 0.16 mg of Sb eq.\nThese figures reflect the scale of computation involved in Gen AI, requiring numerous GPUs, often in regions with carbon-intensive electricity and sometimes water stress. They also include \u201cupstream emissions\u201d \u2013 impacts from manufacturing servers for instance, and not just energy use.\nLearnings and limits of this study\nGiven the results of our study, we are convinced that the following three indicators are of great importance for users, AI developers and policy makers to fully understand and manage the environmental impacts of LLMs:\n-\nthe absolute impacts of training a model,\n-\nthe marginal impacts of inference,\n-\nand the ratio of total inference to total life-cycle impacts.\nIndicators 1 and 2 could be mandatory figures to report in order to inform the public on impacts, while indicator 3 can act as an internal indicator with optional disclosure. The latter indicator is key to grasp a complete vision of lifecycle impacts, and to ensure that models\u2019 training phases are amortized, and not wasted.\nOur study also shows a strong correlation between a model\u2019s size and its footprint. Benchmarks have shown impacts are roughly proportional to model size: a model 10 times bigger will generate impacts one order of magnitude larger than a smaller model for the same amount of generated tokens. This highlights the importance of choosing the right model for the right use case.\nIt is worth noting that this study is a first approximation, with the difficulty to make precise calculations in such an exercise when no standards exist for LLM environment accountability, and the absence of publicly available impact factors. For instance, a reliable life-cycle inventory of GPUs is yet to be made, as their embodied impacts had to be approximated but account for a significant portion of total impacts.\nTo comply with the GHG Protocol Product Standard, future audits made in the industry may follow this study\u2019s principles of using location-based approach for electricity emissions and including all significant upstream impacts\u2014 i.e., not only those from GPU electricity use, but also all other electricity consumptions (CPUs, cooling devices, etc.) and manufacturing of hardware.\nA path toward a global environmental standard for AI\nThese results point to two levers to reduce the environmental impact of LLMs.\n-\nFirst, to improve transparency and comparability, AI companies ought to publish the environmental impacts of their models using standardized, internationally recognized frameworks. Where needed, specific standards for the AI sector could be developed to ensure consistency. This could enable the creation of a scoring system, helping buyers and users identify the least carbon-, water- and material-intensive models.\n-\nSecond, from the user side, encouraging the research for efficiency practices can make a significant difference:\n-\ndeveloping AI literacy to help people use GenAI in the most optimal way,\n-\nchoosing the model size that is best adapted to users\u2019 needs,\n-\ngrouping queries to limit unnecessary computing,\nFor public institutions in particular, integrating model size and efficiency into procurement criteria could send a strong signal to the market.\nConclusion\nMoving forward, we are committed to updating our environmental impact reports in the future and participating in discussions around the development of international industry standards. We will advocate for greater transparency across the entire AI value chain and work to help AI adopters make informed decisions about the solutions that best suit their needs. The results will later be available via ADEME\u2019s Base Empreinte database, setting a new standard for future reference for transparency in the AI sector.\nBy encouraging sufficiency and efficiency practices and publishing standardized environmental impact reports, we can collectively work towards aligning the AI sector with global climate goals. This study is a humble contribution towards a more accessible and sustainable future for AI.\n\u2014\n* This study was carried out following the Frugal AI methodology developed by AFNOR and is compliant with international standards, including the Green House Gas (GHG) Protocol Product Standard and ISO 14040/44.\n** The environmental impacts were assessed using standard indicators common in Lifecycle Analyses (LCAs): greenhouse gas emissions measured by Global Warming Potential over 100 years (GWP100), water consumption measured by Water Consumption Potential (WCP), and material consumption measured by Abiotic Resource Depletion (ADP).\nADP quantifies the depletion of non-renewable resources (such as metals and minerals) by considering both the current extraction rates and the estimated reserves of each material. These values are standardized relative to Antimony\u2019s ADP, providing a uniform unit since Antimony is a scarce resource.\nFor example, extracting 1 kg of gold corresponds to an ADP of 2.35 kg Sb eq, whereas extracting 1 kg of copper corresponds to 0.000000161 kg Sb eq."

      "text": "National Drought Group meets to address \u201cnationally significant\u201d water shortfall\nFive areas remain in drought with six more in prolonged dry weather\nThe National Drought Group met today (Monday 11 August) with the current water shortfall situation in England now defined as a \u201cnationally significant incident.\u201d\nFive areas are officially in drought, with six more experiencing prolonged dry weather following the driest six months to July since 1976.\nDespite the unsettled weather last month, many river flows and reservoir levels in England continued to recede compared to June.\nRainstorms and showers helped mask the fact that July was still the fifth warmest on record.\nAugust has started to see a return of drier conditions and the fourth heatwave of the summer - putting more pressure on already struggling public water supplies and navigational waterways.\nThe National Drought Group - which includes the Met Office, government, regulators, water companies, the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Canal & River Trust, anglers, and conservation experts \u2013 used the meeting to highlight the water-saving measures each sector is taking.\nThey also praised the public for reducing their own daily usage, with Yorkshire Water reporting a 10% reduction in domestic demand following their hosepipe ban. This equates to saving up to 80 million litres per day \u2013 equivalent to 32 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\nThe less water that is used, the less needs to be abstracted from local rivers \u2013 therefore protecting the health of our waterways and wildlife.\nThe Environment Agency\u2019s Director of Water and NDG chair, Helen Wakeham said:\nThe current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment.\nWater companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water. We know the challenges farmers are facing and will continue to work with them, other land users, and businesses to ensure everyone acts sustainably.\nWe are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions. Simple, everyday choices \u2013 such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails \u2013 also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.\nThe recent rainfall has been welcomed by growers, although the impacts from the dry weather remain as farmers continue their harvest.\nThe National Farmers Union noted how water shortages have impacted the growing season this year.\nNFU Vice-President, Rachel Hallos said:\nBritish farmers and growers continue to face extremely dry conditions, with harvest underway and crop yields proving mixed across the country. Some farms are reporting a significant drop in yields, which is financially devasting for the farm business and could have impacts for the UK\u2019s overall harvest.\nFarming is a long-term industry and there is growing concern about the months ahead. Minimal grass growth means many livestock farmers are already tapping into winter feed stocks, raising the risk of higher production costs later in the year.\nAccess to clean, reliable water is essential for food production. What\u2019s worked well during this drought has been early, coordinated communication with stakeholders around licence restrictions and drought permits and orders and it\u2019s crucial this continues.\nTo avoid the swing between extreme drought and flooding and to secure water supplies for food production, we urgently need investment in water infrastructure and a more effective planning system.\nPeriods of dry weather and low rivers reduce oxygen levels in water that can lead to fish kills and more algal blooms. Lower river flows also prevent wildlife from moving up or downstream.\nDrying out wetlands can be devastating for species that depend on those habits while England has seen an increase in wildfires, devastating vulnerable areas of heathland and moorland.\nThe Met Office updated the group on the future weather outlook, noting drier weather has returned.\nChief Meteorologist at the Met Office, Dr Will Lang said:\nThis week is starting off warmer than of late across England and Wales with temperatures getting towards the mid-30s Celsius for some in the south.\nWhile conditions remain mostly settled across the south, the picture is more unsettled further northwest, with rain or showers at times.\nAs we move into the second half of August, there are indications of high pressure building and therefore largely settled conditions overall. Although dry weather is more likely, rain, showers or thunderstorms cannot be ruled out.\nThe heat and climate change also impact human health, through issues such as heatstroke, dehydration, and respiratory problems.\nSteve Reed, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Philip Duffy, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, have also briefed Pat McFadden, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, about the situation.\nSpeaking after attending the meeting, Water Minister Emma Hardy said:\nWorking with the National Drought Group, the Government is urgently stepping up its response to ensure we are successfully managing the impacts of ongoing dry weather.\nWater companies must now take action to follow their drought plans - I will hold them to account if they delay.\nWe face a growing water shortage in the next decade. That\u2019s why we are pushing ahead with root and branch reform under our Plan for Change, which includes \u00a3104 billion of private investment to build nine reservoirs and new pipes to cut leaks.\nCURRENT SITUATION\n-\nDrought has been declared in: Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands.\n-\nAreas in prolonged dry weather (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.\n-\nThe remaining areas are normal: Hertfordshire, London, Kent, Devon and Cornwall.\n-\nYorkshire Water has a Temporary Usage Ban (TUB aka hosepipe ban) in place for all its customers.\n-\nThames, South East Water, and Southern Water have postcode-specific bans.\n-\nReservoirs fell by 2% last week and are now 67.7% full on average across England. The average for the first week of August is 80.5%. Last month, the average was 75.6%\n-\nThe lowest reservoirs are Blithfield (49.1%), Derwent Valley (47.2%), Chew Valley Lake (48.3%), Blagdon (46.3%).\n-\nRainfall in July was 89% of long-term average for the month across England. This is the sixth consecutive month of below average rainfall.\n-\nAcross the country, 51% of river flows were normal with the rest below normal, notably low or exceptionally low.\n-\nTwo rivers \u2013 Wye and Ely Ouse \u2013 were the lowest on record for July\n-\nThere are currently navigation closures or restrictions across sections of the Leeds and Liverpool, Macclesfield, Trent and Mersey, Peak Forest, Rochdale, Oxford and Grand Union Canal.\n-\nMore information here Dry weather and drought in England: 25 to 31 July 2025 - GOV.UK\nACTIONS BY NATIONAL DROUGHT GROUP MEMBERS\n-\nThe UK Health Security Agency is working with the National Drought Group to update its public health impacts of drought guidance\n-\nWater companies are communicating with customers about current risks and advising them how to use water wisely during this dry period.\n-\nWater companies have stepped up action on leakage, with leaks down 41% compared to the level in 1989 when the industry was privatised.\n-\nOver \u00a3700 million has been committed by water companies to tackle leaks over the next five years.\n-\nWater companies have committed to reducing leakage by 50% from a 2017-18 baseline by 2050.\n-\nYorkshire Water reported that repairs of leaks identified by smart meters had saved 1.5 million litres per day.\n-\nYorkshire Water is fixing over 800 leaks per week.\n-\nDwr Cymru Welsh Water is fixing over 700 leaks per week.\n-\nOver 500,000 customers with Anglian Water have had leaks identified via their smart meters. This helped the firm reduce leaks by a total of 187 million litres a day, equivalent to 75 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\n-\nAnglian Water\u2019s satellite technology has also helped prioritise leak detection, saving over 320,000 litres of water a day in rural areas, enough to supply 1,000 homes.\n-\nSouthern Water has 24,000 acoustic sensors attached to the 15,500km of their water network to help detect leaks.\n-\nIn the last 12 months, Southern Water have reduced leaks by almost 20%, saving 138.7 million litres per day.\n-\nSevern Trent has handed out 700 x 1,100 litre bowsers to farmers and several to the West Midlands Safari Park so livestock and animals have water.\n-\nWater-saving messaging has helped reduce demand in the Severn Trent area by 20%, compared to the peak on 11th July.\n-\nUnited Utilities are repairing more than 800 leaks a week and have seen a 200% increase in reports of leaks from customers.\n-\nUnited Utilities is offering free home water audits in some areas, with more than 3,700 booked in.\n-\nThames Water has installed over one million smart meters, which are critical in helping locate leaks.\n-\nSince June, Thames Water has fixed over 1,000 leaks in the region impacted by the hosepipe ban.\nDROUGHT AND THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n-\nThe Environment Agency continues to work with Government, including Defra and the Cabinet Office, on the drought response.\n-\nThe Environment Agency has escalated its operational response and diverted resources to ensure a rapid and nationwide response.\n-\nIt is conducting more compliance checks on businesses who abstract water to ensure regulations are met.\n-\nIt is actively engaging with water companies on requests for drought permits and drought orders and ensuring they follow their drought plans.\n-\nThere is increased monitoring of river and groundwater level and more modelling of rainfall patterns to inform decisions, including additional restrictions.\n-\nThe Environment Agency is working closely with farmers in East Anglia, requesting voluntary reductions on surface water abstraction. This will help conserve and extend the total period when water is available for abstraction, protect the environment and delay the need for any formal restrictions.\n-\nThe regulator has sped up the process of alerting abstractors about restrictions. Manage your water abstraction licence online - GOV.UK.\n-\nThe EA is managing potential navigation issues caused by low flows on the Rivers Thames, Lark and Great Ouse.\nHOW TO SAVE WATER AT HOME\n-\nInstall a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden.\n-\nFix a leaking toilet \u2013 leaky loos can waste 200-400 litres a day.\n-\nUse water from the kitchen to water your plants.\n-\nAvoid watering your lawn \u2013 brown grass will grow back healthy.\n-\nTurn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving.\n-\nTake shorter showers.\n-\nDelete old emails and pictures as data centres require vast amounts of water to cool their systems."
