  "content": "> > THIS IS \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" OUR TOP STORIES THIS MORNING, PRODUCTION HALT. NVIDIA REPORTEDLY ASKS SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SAMSUNG, TO STOP WORK ON THE H 20 AFTER BEIJING URGED LOCAL FIRMS TO AVOID USING IT. CAUTION DOMINATES MARKETS AS SIGNS OF U.S. ECONOMIC STRENGTH HAVE TRADERS TRIMMING BETS ON FED RATE CUTS AHEAD OF JAY POWELL'S JACKSON HOLE SPEECH. ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS WEIGHING HIS GAZA CITY MILITARY PLANS WHILE LEAVING ROOM FOR A DEAL TO BRING BACK ALL REMAINING HOSTAGES. HAS JUST GONE PAST 8:00 A.M. ACROSS THE EMIRATES, 6:00 A.M. HERE IN JOHANNESBURG. I AM JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN FOR JOUMANNA BERCETCHE. AS WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT OAK, THE FOCUS IS ON JEROME POWELL -- SPEAKING ABOUT ALL WEEK, THE FOCUS IS ON JEROME POWELL'S SPEECH AT JACKSON HOLE. MANY MARKET PARTICIPANTS WONDERING WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GET FROM JAY POWELL, ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE PRESSURE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO BRING CUTS INTO THE FOLD. LET'S TAKE A LOOKOUT WHERE MARKETS ARE POSITIONED AHEAD OF THE TRADING DAY. NASDAQ FUTURES MARGINALLY DOWN RIGHT NOW, THOUGH LARGELY FLAT RIGHT NOW. AS WE WERE MENTIONING, CAUTION REALLY TAKING SHAPE WITHIN THE MARKETS. U.S. EQUITY FUTURES FLAT ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT COMING AFTER WE DID SEE A DOWN DAY FOR THE TECH HEAVY NASDAQ. FOCUS IS TAKING SHAPE AT THE NEWS OF NVIDIA ORDERING THAT SUSPENSION OF CHIP PRODUCTION. AND OF COURSE, WE ARE WAITING FOR NVIDIA EARNINGS THAT WILL COME NEXT WEEK. BITCOIN ALSO AND FOCUS, STRENGTHENING -- IN FOCUS, STRENGTHENING RELATIVELY AT LEAST THIS FRIDAY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN BITCOIN AND ETHER ETF'S LOGGING FOR STRAY SESSIONS OF OUTFLOWS WITH INVESTORS PULLING A NET $1.9 BILLION. BITCOIN HAS PULLED BACK QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE HIGHS WE DID SEE LAST WEEK. BITCOIN TRADING AT $112,000. THE U.S. 10 YEAR YIELD IN FOCUS AS WE AWAIT THOSE COMMENTS FROM FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL. THE 10 YEAR YIELD AT 4.3257. WE HAVE BRENT CRUDE ON THE BOARD AS WELL, SLIGHTLY WEAKER ON THE DAY, THOUGH SHAPING UP FOR ITS FIRST WEEKLY GAIN IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS ON THOSE POTENTIAL PROGRESS TALKS THAT WE DID START THE WEEK OFF BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, POTENTIALLY SETTING UP CEASE FIRE TALKS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. A DRAW DOWN IN U.S. INVENTORIES, BRENT CRUDE TRADING AT ABOUT $67.58 A BARREL. LET'S CHECK IN ON HOW MARKETS IN ASIA ARE FARING. MINMIN LOW HAS BEEN WATCHING IT FROM OUR HONG KONG STUDIO. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING? MINMIN: MARKETS A LITTLE BIT ON EDGE TODAY AS WE LOOK TOWARD JACKSON HOLE. YOU CAN SEE THE ASIA PACIFIC BENCHMARK TRADING SIDEWAYS TODAY BUT THE KOSPI LEADING GAINS AHEAD OF THE FIRST EVER U.S.- SOUTH KOREAN SUMMIT HAPPEN NEXT WEEK SO WE ARE SEEING FLOWS INTO SECTORS LIKE CHIPS. DRAGGED DOWN BY TSMC ON THE BACK OF THIS NEWS THAT NVIDIA HAS BEEN ASKING SOME COMPONENT SUPPLIERS TO HALT PRODUCTION OF THE H20 CHIPS AS CHINA EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY ISSUES. WE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW JAPAN IS FARING AS WELL BECAUSE WE GOT CPI DATA OUT OF JAPAN TODAY, 3.1% ON THE CPI, BEATING ESTIMATES OF 3%, BUT CERTAINLY STILL FAR ABOVE THE BOJ'S TARGET RATE OF 2%. THAT CONTINUES TO CEMENT THE IDEA THAT THE BOJ MIGHT BE BEHIND THE CURVE WHEN IT COMES TO RATE HIKES. THE POINTING WEAKER -- THE YEN POINTING WEAKER, HOVERING AROUND THE ONE WEEK WEAKNESS ON THE BACK OF THE PAIR BACK RATE CUT IN THE U.S. JACKSON HOLE WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHED BY INVESTORS. JENNIFER: MINMIN LOW STARTING US OFF. WE WILL CHECK BACK IN IN JUST A BIT. THEIR INFORMATION HAS REPORTED THAT NVIDIA INSTRUCTED SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SAMSUNG AND AMCOR, TO HALT PRODUCTION OF ITS AGE 20 AI CHIP. BEIJING ADVISED COMPANIES TO STEER CLEAR OF SECURITY CONCERNS FOR THE CHIP GO FOR THE CHINESE MARKET. NVIDIA HAS REPEATEDLY DENIED IT BUILDS BACKDOORS INTO A ITS PRODUCT -- BUILDS BACKDOORS INTO ITS PRODUCTS. > > > > U.S. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS APPROVED LICENSES FOR US TO EXPORT AGE 20 AI CHIP'S TO CHINA. RECENTLY, CHINA ASKED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME SECURITY BACKDOORS IN OUR SHIPS. -- CHIPS. WE HAVE MADE VERY CLEAR AND PUT TO REST THAT H 20 HAS NO SECURITY BACKDOORS. JENNIFER: OUR CHIEF NORTH ASIA CORRESPONDENT, STEPHEN ENGLE, IS JOINING US NOW FOR MORE. SURPRISING NEWS COMING FROM THE COMPANY, ESPECIALLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE EARNINGS. GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT. > > OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A SEESAW STORY, BECAUSE THE AGE 20 WAS DESIGNED TO ADHERE TO EXPORT CONTROLS FROM THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION THROUGH CHINA. THE AGE 20 IS A MORE SCALED -- H20 WAS DESIGNED TO ADHERE TO EXPORT CONTROLS FROM THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION UNDER CHINA. THE H20 IS A SCALED DOWN BLACKWELL. THERE WAS THAT HIGH-PROFILE MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE BETWEEN JENSEN HUANG AND TRUMP IN JULY. THEY GOT IT BACK ALLOWING THOSE EXPORT LICENSES FOR THE H20 TO CHINA. CHINA BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE TECH COMPANIES IN CHINA STARTED ORDERING THEM QUITE IN LARGE VOLUMES. BUT ONLY RECENTLY, AS YOU RIGHTFULLY SAID, AND ALSO OF COURSE JENSEN HUANG JUST ALLUDED TO IN AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE IN TAIPEI, HE SAID CHINESE AUTHORITIES ARE STARTING AND REGULATORS ARE ESSENTIALLY TELLING CHIP COMPANIES IN CHINA, DON'T BUY THE H20, SO DEFINITELY A SEESAW BATTLE GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR NVIDIA. AS IT USED TO BANK QUITE A BIT OF ITS REVENUE FROM THE CHINA MARKET AND THAT WAS SEEN AS A REPRIEVE WHEN THE H20 COULD GO BACK INTO CHINA SO WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT. IT HAS DEFINITELY BENEFITED CHINESE CHIP COMPANIES AND AI PLAYS IN CHINA, AS THE AUTHORITIES IN CHINA HAVE ALL ESSENTIALLY PUSHED CHINESE DOMESTIC TECH COMPANIES TO RELY ON DOMESTIC ALTERNATIVES TO NVIDIA BECAUSE OF THOSE SECURITY BACKDOORS. AND ALSO, LET'S FACE IT, JENNIFER, CHINESE AUTHORITIES WERE SORT OF INSULTED BY THE U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY, HOWARD LUTNICK, WHO SAID IN AN INTERVIEW ON CNBC, WE DON'T SELL OUR BEST AFTER CHINA. WE DON'T EVEN SELL OUR SECOND-BEST STUFF TO CHINA. WE DON'T EVEN SELL OUR THIRD-BEST STUFF YOU CHINA. SO THERE'S BEEN A BACKLASH. JENNIFER: HOW DO YOU SEE THIS AFFECTING TRADE TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS? > > WELL, AGAIN, THERE'S GOING TO BE UPS AND DOWNS IN THE TRADE TALKS. SO FAR, THERE'S BEEN A SECOND EXTENDED TRUCE. OBVIOUSLY IN THIS AUTUMN, WE ARE GOING TO SEE LIKELY DONALD TRUMP COMING OUT TO ASIA, WHETHER IT'S ON THE SIDELINES OR ASEAN OR A STATE VISIT TO CHINA. WE KNOW TRUMP WANTS TO MEET XI JINPING. THEY WANT TO HAMMER OUT THESE ISSUES. THESE TECH CONTROLS FROM THE UNITED STATES WERE AT THE CENTER OF CHINA'S DEMANDS TO RELAX THEM. NOW IT IS CHINA SAYING WE DON'T WANT THOSE CHIPS, SO IT'S ANOTHER FOLD IN THE CONVOLUTED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES. JENNIFER: CONVOLUTED IS A GREAT WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. THANKS SO MUCH, CHIEF NORTH ASIA CORRESPONDENT STEPHEN ENGLE THERE. TRADERS HAVE PARED BACK WAGERS ON A FED RATE CUT AHEAD OF CHAIR JEROME POWELL'S MUCH ANTICIPATED SPEECH AND JACKSON HOLE. BLOOMBERG'S MICHAEL MCKEE HAS MORE. > > THE CAST IS IN PLACE. THE WALL STREET AUDIENCES WATCHING. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE YET IS A SCRIPT. THAT'S A JAY POWELL JOB. IN HIS LAST SPEECH HERE AS CHAIR, POWELL IS EXPECTED TO LAY OUT THE PARAMETERS OF THE FED'S NEW POLICY FRAMEWORK, HOW THEY THINK ABOUT THE DECISIONS TO RAISE OR LOWER INTEREST RATES. IS ALSO EXPECTED TO TOUCH ON WHETHER THEY WILL RAISE OR LOWER INTEREST RATES AT THEIR NEXT MEETING ON SEPTEMBER 17. INVESTORS MAY BE DISAPPOINTED IF THEY ARE EXPECTING HIM TO SAY YES. EMPLOYMENT HAS WEEKEND AND INFLATION HAS TAKES UP -- HAS TICKED UP, TWO DEVELOPMENTS THAT CALL FOR DIFFERENT POLICY RESPONSES. AFTER POWELL'S REMARKS TO OPEN THE CONFERENCE, ATTENDEES WILL DIVE INTO A SERIES OF ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET OF THE FUTURE, HOW DEMOGRAPHICS, AI, AND IMMIGRATION WILL AFFECT JOBS. INVESTORS WILL LIKELY TUNE OUT THAT PART. FOR THEM, THE SYMPOSIUM BEGINNING IS THE END. MICHAEL MCKEE, BLOOMBERG, JACKSON HOLE. JENNIFER: NOW FOR MORE ON WHAT INVESTORS ARE WATCHING OUT FOR, LET'S BRING IN GARETH NICHOLSON, CIO AT NOMURA INTERNATIONAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. MICHAEL MCKEE SETTING US UP NICELY HEADING INTO FRIDAY. GIVE US YOUR PERSPECTIVE. HOW ARE YOU LOOKING INTO THE SPEECH FROM THE FED CHAIR? GARETH: I THINK IT'S ULTIMATELY DOWN TO THE ONE-MAN SHOW AND IT HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST YEAR AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT NOW CHAIRMAN POWELL HAS DEFINITELY TAKEN THAT FRONT SEAT. HE WILL DRIVE THE NARRATIVE. THE RISK ON NARRATIVE IF IT CONTINUES. MARKET IS PRICING IN 90%, NOW THEY HAVE MOVED DOWN THE CHANCE OF A RATE CUT IN SEPTEMBER. THERE IS STILL THE CHANCE OF A LARGER THAN ONE RATE CUT, LARGER THAN 25 BASIS POINT. SO THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME LEADERSHIP. JEROME POWELL SHOULD BE THAT LEADER. TO YOUR POINT, THERE STILL A LOT OF DATA BETWEEN ON THE MEETING. PMI -- BETWEEN NOW AND THE MEETING. YOU HAVE PMI'S COMING OUT. IF WE LOOK AT INFLATION, LABOR MARKET, WE THINK THE LABOR MARKET IS WEAK ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ONE RATE CUT IN SEPTEMBER, FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER ONE IN DECEMBER AND ANOTHER ONE IN MARCH. THIS WILL ALIGN WITH WHERE WE THINK THE ECONOMY IS GOING. IT WILL LIKELY BE A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR RISK MARKETS, POSITIVE FOR RISK. JENNIFER: YOU SAID POSITIVE FOR RISK. WE ARE SEEING INVESTORS LARGELY SITTING ON THE SIDELINES, A BIT OF A RISK OF SENTIMENT. WHERE DO WE START POTENTIALLY TO SEE SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY AFTER THE FED CHAIR GIVES HIS SPEECH? WHERE DO WE START TO SEE A BIT OF RISK ON PILING INTO THE MARKETS? GARETH: TYPICALLY, YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST MOVERS NOW DOWN ARE GOING TO SEE THE BIGGEST KNEE-JERK REACTIONS UP. WE ARE LOOKING FOR A LONGER TERM WHEN WE LOOK FURTHER RISK ON METRIC. WE STILL LIKE U.S. EQUITY BUT WE UNDERSTAND MANY SECTORS ARE TRADING PARTICULARLY TYPE, PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE -- TIGHT, PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE. THE RISK ON GOING INTO PRIVATE MARKETS IS A GRIND HIGHER FOR THE U.S. MARKET. WOULD PROBABLY THINK THERE IS MORE MAJOR IF WE DO SEE THE RATE CUTTING IN OTHER REGIONS -- METER IF WE DO SEE THE RATE CUTTING AND OTHER REGIONS SO WE COULD SEE CHINA, JAPAN FOLLOWING SUIT IN THEIR EQUITY MARKETS WITH THIS IDEA THAT MONETARY CONDITIONS IN THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN LOOSE. THAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT. CONDITIONS ARE ALREADY RELATIVELY LOOSE FOR COMPANIES. EARNINGS ARE SHORING THROUGH VERY STRONG. NOW WITH RATE CUTS ON THE WAY, THAT IS A BOOSTER EQUITY MARKETS. AND IT'S NOW JUST THE POINT, HOW MUCH HIGHER CAN THEY GET BEFORE WE GET A LITTLE BIT OF A WOBBLE? WE THINK IT CAN GRIND HIGHER. JENNIFER: SIDEMEN WIDE OF BLOOMBERG TEAM SUGGESTING THAT POTENTIALLY SIGNS OF A CORRECTION -- SIMON WHITE OF BLOOMBERG TEAM SUGGESTING THAT POTENTIALLY SIGNS OF A CORRECTION ARE NEAR. GARETH: WE HAVE CERTAIN SECTORS THAT ARE LEADING THE PACK. SOME OF THE EARNINGS DISPERSION IS HUGE. THAT IS QUITE WORRISOME. WE KNOW THE BREADTH OF THE MARKETS, 40% OF THE MARKET IS ACCOUNTED BY TOP 10 NAMES. THAT IS NOT PARTICULARLY HEALTHY. BUT THE MARKET IS PARSING THROUGH A LOT OF -- PASSING THROUGH A LOT OF INFLATION TO CUSTOMERS. EARNINGS STILL REMAIN HIGH. YOU STILL HAVE A ROBUST ECONOMY. WE THINK THERE IS SPACE TO GRIND HIGHER. THE TRICKY THING IS AS YOU PICK UP COINS AND FROM THE TRAIN, DO YOU WANT TO KEEP DOING THAT OR DIVERSIFY A LITTLE BIT OUT? WE ARE STILL PREPARING. WE THINK THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF JUICE STILL LEFT IN JAPANESE EQUITY MARKETS, IN THE CHINESE EQUITY MARKET, SO THESE ARE SPACES THAT WE ARE LARGELY MOVING LARGE OVERWEIGHT IN THE U.S. ABROAD. JENNIFER: DO YOU FOCUS ON EQUITIES AS OPPOSED TO CREDIT? GARETH: WELL, THERE'S THREE MAIN. EQUITIES IS A GRIND HIGHER. WE STILL LIKE IT. CREDIT SPREADS ARE INCREDIBLY TIGHT. THEY ARE NOT OFFERING MUCH CHRISTIAN. WE ARE GOING TO SEE -- MUCH CHRISTIAN. WE ARE GOING TO -- MUSH CUSHION. WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE FED. AND OTHER FIXED INCOME. THINGS LIKE PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE, PRIVATE CREDIT THERE ARE CERTAIN SECTORS WE THINK OFFER A GOOD RISK RETURN AT THE CURRENT LEVELS. JENNIFER: GARETH NICHOLSON, CIO AT NOMURA INTERNATIONAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, JOINING US WITH THEIR INSIGHTS AND ANALYSIS ON THIS JACKSON HOLE DAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. COMING UP, WE TURN TO THE MIDDLE EAST. ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, IS LANE GAZA CITY MILITARY PLANS WHILE LEAVING LIVE RADIO -- IS WEIGHING GAZA CITY MILITARY PLANS WHILE LEAVING ROOM FOR A DEAL. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYS HE HAS INSTRUCTED NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO BRING BACK HOSTAGES HELD IN GAZA. SPEAKING DURING A VISIT TO THE ARMY'S GAZA DIVISION HEADQUARTERS, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID HE WILL GIVE FINAL APPROVAL FOR PLANTS OR TAKE OVER GAZA CITY AND DEFEAT HAMAS. LET'S BRING IN STUART LIVINGSTONE-WALLACE, BLOOMBERG'S EXECUTIVE EDITOR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, RUSSIA, AND AFRICA. NETANYAHU SAYING HE'S PUSHING AHEAD WITH THE GAZA CITY TAKE ALSO RENEWED CEASE-FIRE TALKS -- HE'S PUSHING AHEAD WITH THE GAZA CITY PLAN AND ALSO RENEWED CEASE-FIRE TALKS. > > CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS, THAT DOES APPEAR TO BE ANOTHER SETBACK ON THE FACE OF IT BECAUSE WHAT HAMAS AGREED TO EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND WHAT HAD BEEN PUT FORWARD BY THE MEDIA WAS EGYPT, QATAR WAS A PHASED RELEASE OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS. WHAT NETANYAHU SEEMS TO BE ASKING FOR IS THE RELEASED OF OF THE HOSTAGES ALL AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S NOT WHOLLY SURPRISING. WE'VE SEEN THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN WHERE IT'S BEEN VERY HARD TO REACH SOME SORT OF CONSENSUS ON THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE DOESN'T LIKE IS PUSHING AHEAD WITH HIS GAZA CITY OFFENSIVE. WE SAW THE CALL UP OF THE RESERVISTS, SOME 60,000 OF THEM, AND THEIR AND I THINK ANOTHER 20,000 OF THEM WHICH WILL HAVE THEIR SERVICE EXTENDED. ITS TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT PRESSURE ON HAMAS TO GIVE A MORE IN THE WAY OF CONCESSIONS IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS. IT'S A CONTINUATION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT FEELS LIKE A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT. JENNIFER: WE ARE ALSO SEEING ISRAEL PUSHING AHEAD ON PLANS TO EXPAND JEWISH SETTLEMENTS IN THE WEST BANK. WE ARE JUST A FEW WEEKS OUT FROM THE UNGA, WHERE A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES SAY THEY WILL RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD. HOW DOES THAT COMPLICATE THOSE TALKS? > > I THINK IT IS GOING TO MAKE A. VERY DIFFICULT SO ON THE ONE HAND -- I THINK IT IS GOING TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT. SO ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE AN AREA THAT BISECTS THE WEST BANK, MAKES IT VERY HARD TO COME UP WITH ANY SORT OF TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY FOR ANY FUTURE STATE. THE WEST BANK WAS ALREADY THIS PATCHWORK OF SETTLEMENTS IN PALESTINIAN AREA. IT'S MADE THINGS MORE COMPLICATED BUT THE COMPLICATION WAS ALREADY THERE. IN TERMS OF THE INTERNATIONAL REACTION, WE DID SEE A VERY STRONG STATEMENT LAST NIGHT FROM A GREAT MANY COUNTRIES. AND AGAIN, IT'S THAT CONTINUATION I THINK OF THIS SORT OF GROWING GROUP OF COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. THAT ARE CONDEMNING THESE MOVES, NOT HELPED BY THESE VERY INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS FROM CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, THIS BASICALLY PUTS TO BED ANY IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE A FUTURE PALESTINIAN STATE. SO I THINK THAT MAKES THINGS VERY DIFFICULT AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHEN YOU HAVE THIS INTERNATIONAL MEETING COMING UP IN NEW YORK IN A FEW WEEKS, I THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO BE RATHER DIFFICULT. JENNIFER: SHAPING UP TO BE SOME FASCINATING CONVERSATIONS. STUART LIVINGSTONE-WALLACE, BLOOMBERG'S EXECUTIVE EDITOR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, NORTH AFRICA, AND RUSSIA JOINING US IN DUBAI. THANKS SO MUCH. WITH WASHINGTON PULLING BACK, POWERS FROM ACROSS THE ROAD ARE STEPPING INTO DEEP IN TIES WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES -- DEEPEN TIES WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE DETAILS ON THAT, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I AM JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. AFRICA IS LOOKING FOR NEW ALLIES AS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRADE WAR RESHAPES GLOBAL MARKETS. WITH WASHINGTON PULLING BACK, POWERS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD ARE STEPPING INTO DEEPEN TIES. AFRICAN AND JAPANESE LEADERS ARE MEETING THIS WEEK AS PART OF A WIDER GLOBAL SCRAMBLE FOR INFLUENCE. > > AFRICA CONTINENTAL OF FREE TRADE AREA IS CENTERED AROUND OUR ECONOMIC VISION. SOUTH AFRICA SEEKS TO DEEPEN INTER-AFRICA TRADE WHILE BECOMING A CONTINENTAL INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM FROM WHICH JAPANESE AND OTHER GLOBAL FIRMS CAN EXPAND AND EXPORT INTO OUR CONTINENT. JENNIFER: FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN BLOOMBERG'S ONDIRO OGANGA, WHO JOINS US NOW FROM KIGALI. HOW ENDURING IS THIS PURSUE FOR NEW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN JAPAN AND AFRICAN COUNTRIES AS WE HAVE BEEN SEEING OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS? ONDIRO: IT IS CLEAR AS DAY AND IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE OPTICS, THERE ARE 20 LEADERS FROM BIG AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THEY WANTED TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT. ANTONIO GUTERRES SAYS WE ARE LEAVING AT A TIME OF INTERCONNECTED CRISIS AND DEEP INEQUALITY AND THERE'S NEED FOR CLEAR FOCUS AND DEVELOPMENT, NOT JUST FOR AFRICA BUT WITH AFRICA. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JAPAN DID. LEADERSHIP PLEDGING LOANS OF UP TO $5.5 BILLION TO COME TO THE AFRICAN CONTINENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FIRM TO HELP TACKLE DEBT BURDEN THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTING THE CONTINENT. WE'VE SEEN COUNTRIES LIKE ZAMBIA, GHANA, AND ETHIOPIA DEFAULT. THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER THINGS, FOR EXAMPLE, DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP, TRAINING PEOPLE IN A I, AND ALSO CREATING ECONOMIC INTERCONNECTEDNESS, SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN THE PACIFIC AND INDIAN OCEAN. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WAS TARIFFS. YOU CANNOT IGNORE THE FACT THAT SOUTH AFRICA IS CARING NEARLY 30% OF RECIPROCAL TARIFF. THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID THAT IT IS TIME TO FIND A WAY TO DIVERSIFY EXPORT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY FOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW IT TOOK SOUTH AFRICA 15 YEARS TO GET AN AVOCADO DEAL. HE SAID IF IT TAKES ANOTHER 15 YEARS, HE WILL PROBABLY NOT BE HERE, AND CLASSICALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE BUREAUCRATIC AND STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH NEGOTIATING A TRADE DEAL. IT'S NOT JUST ONE SIDE. JAPAN IS ALSO MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORT. THEY COUNTRY HAS BEEN TRYING TO BUILD COMPANIES IN SOUTH AFRICA. JENNIFER: HOW DOES JAPAN COMPARED TO OTHER PEERS, OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE SAME? ONDIRO: THEY ARE ENTERING AN OVER SATURATED AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. YOU LOOK AT CHINA, BIGGEST BILATERAL LENDER, BIGGEST TRADE PARTNER FOR THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE HAS BEEN A BIG SUCCESS ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. THEY'VE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY TO GO INTO INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS LIKE ROAD AND RAILWAY. THIS HAS COME WITH ITS OWN DOWNSIDE WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF DEBT TRAPPING SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES. WE HAVE SEEN ETHIOPIA, ANGOLA STRUGGLE WITH THE WEIGHT OF THEIR DEBT. CAN YEAH SAYING THE WEIGHT -- KENYA SAYING THE WEIGHT OF PAYING CHINESE DEBT. JENNIFER: BLOOMBERG'S ONDIRO OGANGA IN KIGALI, RWANDA. BOEING COULD LAND A 500 JET SALE TO CHINA. MORE ON THAT, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a \u266a JENNIFER: THIS IS \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" OUR TOP STORIES THIS MORNING, PRODUCTION HALT. NVIDIA REPORTEDLY ASKS SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SAMSUNG, TO STOP WORK ON ITS H20 AI CHIP AFTER BEIJING URGED LOCAL FIRMS TO AVOID USING IT. CAUTION DOMINATES MARKETS AS SIGNS OF U.S. ECONOMIC STRENGTH HAVE TRADERS TRIMMING BETS ON FED RATE CUTS AHEAD OF JAY POWELL'S JACKSON HOLE SPEECH. AND ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS WEIGHING HIS GAZA CITY MILITARY PLANS WHILE LEAVING ROOM FOR A DEAL TO BRING BACK ALL REMAINING HOSTAGES. IT HAS JUST GONE PAST 8:30 A.M. ACROSS THE EMIRATES, 6:30 A.M. HERE IN JOHANNESBURG. I AM JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN FOR JOUMANNA BERCETCHE. FRIDAY IS HERE. FRIDAY, AUGUST 22, WHICH IS ALSO NOTABLE BECAUSE OF THAT JACKSON HOLE SYMPOSIUM AND THE SPEECH WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FROM FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL THAT IS COMING LATER TODAY. INVESTORS SQUARELY FOCUSING IN ON THAT, CAUTION, AS WE JUST MENTIONED, STILL SETTING IN ON THE MARKETS AS THEY WAIT AND SEE WHETHER WE DO GET INDICATIONS OF WHETHER WE SEE A RATE CUT IN SEPTEMBER. U.S. EQUITY FUTURES RELATIVELY FLAT. NASDAQ 100 FUTURES STILL FLAT. ALTHOUGH THE TECH HEAVY NASDAQ IN FOCUS AS WE JUST INDICATED. NVIDIA ORDERING THAT SUSPENSION OF CHIP PRODUCTION AND THAT COMING AHEAD OF THEIR EARNINGS NEXT WEEK. THE NASDAQ AND FOCUS. BITCOIN -- IN FOCUS. BITCOIN SHOWING SOME STRENGTH AHEAD OF JEROME POWELL'S SPEECH BUT WE HAVE SEEN BITCOIN PULLING BACK FROM HIGHS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS. WE ARE SEEING YIELDS PULLBACK RIGHT NOW AS WELL. THE U.S. 10 YEAR YIELD AT 4.32 57. AND OF COURSE, A LOTTO FOCUS IN ON WHAT WE ARE WANT TO HEAR FROM FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL, ESPECIALLY AS HE HAS CONTINUALLY FELT AND GOT A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO BEGIN THOSE RATE CUTS. AND JUST FINALLY, BRENT CRUDE ON THE BOARD, WEAKER ON THE DAY EVER SO SLIGHTLY BUT STILL SHAPING UP FOR HIS FIRST WEEKLY GAIN IN THREE WEEKS ON THOSE POTENTIAL PROGRESS ON CEASE-FIRE TALKS BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA AND ALSO ON A REPORT WE GOT THIS WEEK ON U.S. INVENTORIES. BRENT CRUDE ARE TRADING AT $67.60 A BARREL. LET'S CHECK IN ON HOW MARKETS IN ASIA ARE FARING. MINMIN LOW IS STANDING BY IN OUR HONG KONG STUDIO. MINMIN: THE MARKETS LARGELY TRADING SIDEWAYS IN ASIA AS WE AWAIT JACKSON HOLE. WOULD CONTINUE TO SEE THIS LIQUIDITY RALLY IN CHINA AND MORGAN STANLEY SAYING THIS RALLY IS LIKELY TO EXTEND THROUGH THE SUMMER. WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE HANG SENG BECAUSE THERE'S A SEMI ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT GOING ON TODAY. WIDELY SPECULATED TO BE ONE OF THE POTENTIAL -- PART MARK -- POP MART WIDELY EXPECTED TO BE ONE OF THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONS. CHINA URGE LOCAL COMPANIES NOT TO PURCHASE H20 CHIPS ON THE BACK OF SECURITY CONCERNS. WHAT'S BAD FOR NVIDIA IS GOOD FOR CHINESE CHIP STOCKS. WE SEE A SEA OF GREEN. JEN? JENNIFER: MINMIN LOW IN HONG KONG FOR US THERE. AND WE ARE ALSO STICKING WITH THIS STORY. BLOOMBERG HAS LEARNED THAT BOEING IS CLOSE TO FINALIZING A DEAL TO SELL AS MUCH AS 500 AIRCRAFT TO CHINA. THE DEAL IS CONTINGENT ON THE EASING TRADE HOSTILITIES THAT DATE BACK TO FORMER PRESIDENT -- OFFICIALS HAVE ALREADY STARTED CONSULTING DOMESTIC AIRLINES ABOUT HOW MANY BOEING AIRCRAFT THEY WILL NEED. LET'S BRING BACK IN OUR CHINA CORRESPONDENT MINMIN LOW. IS THIS EXPECTED TO BE A CENTERPIECE OF ANY BIGGER TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S.? WALK US THROUGH THIS. MINMIN: YES, DEFINITELY. YOU LOOK AT THESE BOEING AIRPLANES, THEY ARE COST IN UPWARDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH, SO A DEAL THE SIZE OF ABOUT 500 AIRPLANES, THAT'S GOING TO GO SOMEWHERE TO REDUCE THE TRADE IMBALANCE BETWEEN U.S. AND CHINA. IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR BOTH PRESIDENT XI AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE LAST TIME THERE WAS SUCH A DEAL WAS BACK IN 2017 WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITED CHINA AND BOTH SIDES ANNOUNCED THIS AGREEMENT, CHINA COMMITTING TO BUY 300 AIRPLANES FROM BOEING. WE HAVE SEEN THIS SHARP DROP UP IN THE AMOUNT OF ORDERS FROM BOEING FOR CHINA. THAT COINCIDED WITH THE SOURING OF TIES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. POTENTIALLY WE ARE GOING TO SEE A REPEAT OF 20 A PRESIDENT XI AND TRUMP MEET BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR AND THIS COULD POTENTIALLY ANCHOR ANY TRADE AGREEMENT THAT COULD COME OUT OF THAT. BOEING IS SORT OF WORKING OUT THE TERMS OF THE DEAL, LOOKING AT DETAILS LIKE DELIVERY TIMES AND WHAT TYPES OF AIRCRAFT CHINA WILL WANT. JENNIFER: DOES IT GET IN THE WAY OF CHINA'S OWN AMBITIONS FOR HOMEGROWN AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING? MINMIN: YEAH, WE KNOW CHINA HAS BEEN WANTING TO GROW ITS OWN AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING SECTOR. IT HAS ITS OWN AIRPLANE MAKER AS WELL AND IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION, HOW MUCH OF A SLICE OF THE PIE DO THEY GET? GIVEN WE REPORTED THAT CHINA IS ALSO LOOKING AT A DEAL WITH AIRBUS, ANOTHER 500 JET'S THEY ARE HOPING TO BUY FROM AIRBUS. TOGETHER WITH THE BOEING DEAL, A TOTAL OF 1000 JUST THAT CHINA WILL BE WANTING TO BUY. THAT WILL DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF CHINA'S AIRCRAFTS RIGHT NOW. THE RAMP UP TO PRODUCE THOSE HAS BEEN SLOW. IT SHOWS YOU THAT SHINE IS STILL QUITE RELIANT ON WESTERN INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY. BUT OF COURSE, A LOT IS VERY DEPENDENT ON HOW TO TRADE TENSIONS ARE RESOLVED. [AUDIO DROP] THIS IS STILL, ACCORDING TO SOURCES -- JENNIFER: THAT IS A BLOOMBERG SCOOP REPORTING FROM HONG KONG. MINMIN LOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT REPORT. LET'S TURN BACK TO THE MARKETS. EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES FALLING FOR A SIXTH STRAIGHT DAY AS STRONG U.S. MANUFACTURING DATA COMBINED WITH FRESH HAWKISH SIGNALS FROM THE FED WEIGH ON EXPECTATIONS FOR RATE CUTS. JOINING US IS ZAHABIA GUPTA, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF EMERGING MARKETS CREDIT RESEARCH AT S & P. LET'S START ABOUT THE POTENTIAL -- LET'S START WITH THE POTENTIAL OF WHAT WE COULD HEAR FROM JEROME POWELL AND LET'S FOCUS ON EM. ZAHABIA: ALL EYES ARE ON CHAIR POWELL AND HIS COMMENTS THAT WILL COME OUT TODAY. EVERYBODY IS WATCHING OUT FOR THE TONE THAT HE WILL TAKE ABOUT THE PATH FORWARD ON EASING IN SEPTEMBER. ACTUALLY, SEPTEMBER IS QUITE A CRUCIAL MONTH FOR MONETARY POLICY BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOUR MAJOR CENTRAL BANKS ANNOUNCING THEIR DECISION. THAT'S THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, THE U.S. FED, BANK OF ENGLAND, AND BANK OF JAPAN. THE BANKS ARE IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF MONETARY POLICY, THE CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT. FOR THE FED, THE MAIN CHALLENGE IS GOING TO START RESUMING RATE CUTS. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE INFLATION REMAINING ABOVE TARGET, MORE UPSIDE RISKS TO COME AS THE TARIFFS KICK IN. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE LABOR MARKETS STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKNESS. WE THINK THE PRESSURE WILL START TO FORM TOWARDS MONETARY EASING. WE ARE EXPECTING A TOTAL OF 15 BASIS POINTS CUTS IN RATES BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. NOW, IN TERMS OF, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR EMERGING MARKETS? WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE IS IT CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE MONETARY POLICY PATH FOR EMERGING MARKETS AS WELL, BECAUSE THEY TEND TO KEEP A FAVORABLE DEFERENTIAL -- DIFFERENTIAL WITH THE MAJOR CENTRAL BANKS AND THEIR RATES. WE MIGHT START TO SEE AN IMPACT ON BOND YIELDS AND SPREADS, AS WELL AS WE WILL BE SEEN WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE DOLLAR INDEX, AND THEREFORE WHAT IT MEANS FOR EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES. JENNIFER: CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PORTFOLIO FLOWS THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING WITH EM CREDIT OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND HOW THAN THAT WILL CHANGE? ZAHABIA: PORTFOLIO INFLOWS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN VERY STRONG SINCE APRIL IN PARTICULAR INTO EMERGING MARKETS. AND THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN HELPED BY A FEW FACTORS. IT'S BEEN HELPED BY A VERY DECENT FINANCING CONDITIONS, A WEAKER DOLLAR FROM THE START OF THE YEAR, AS WELL AS VERY STRONG INFLOWS WE HAVE SEEN COME OUT OF MAINLAND CHINA. SPREADS HAVE BEEN QUITE NARROW FOR EMERGING MARKETS AS WELL, SO THAT HAS ALSO HELPED THE BORROWING COSTS. JENNIFER: WHAT DO YOU SEE AS POTENTIALLY THE BIGGEST RISK TO ANY OF THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL FOR SOME OF THE PORTFOLIO INFLOWS THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING? ZAHABIA: THE KEY RISKS ARE REALLY MORE THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE TRADE POLICY AND THE TARIFFS THAT WE ARE SEEING. SINCE THE NEW TARIFFS WERE ANNOUNCED ON AUGUST 1 AND ARE EFFECTIVE FROM AUGUST 7, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF, THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DEAL WE WILL SEE WITH CHINA, THE DETAILS OF THE OTHER TRADE DEALS THAT HAVE BEEN SIGNED, WHAT WE MIGHT SEE COME UP FOR SPECIFIC SECTOR TARIFFS AS WELL ON THE SECTOR 232 INVESTIGATIONS. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND THAT POLICY UNCERTAINTY MIGHT START TO HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT FOR EMERGING MARKETS, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE RISK ON, RISK OFF SENTIMENT TOWARDS EM'S AND HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR BORROWING, AS WELL AS OVERALL GROWTH BECAUSE THEIR FORTUNES ARE ALSO LINKED TO WHAT WE WILL SEE HAPPEN WITH GROWTH IN THE U.S. AND CHINA. JENNIFER: IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE OIL PRODUCERS THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT? I SEE IN YOUR REPORT YOU TALK ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA. IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER ECONOMIES THAT YOU LOOK AT? ZAHABIA: IN SOME WAYS, THE OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO SEE STRONGER GROWTH. ONE BIG REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE INCREASING OIL PRODUCTION. OPEC-PLUS HAS BEEN RELEASING A LOT MORE BARRELS INTO THE MARKETS. THAT IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE OIL OUTPUT AND OIL GROWTH. ON THE NONOIL SIDE AS WELL, WE HAVE SEEN VERY STRONG ACTIVITIES SO FAR THIS YEAR, PARTICULARLY FOR SAUDI ARABIA AND THE UAE. SO THEY ARE BENEFITING FROM PUBLIC INVESTMENTS, THE STRONG PUSH FOR VISION 2030, AND THOSE REFORMS, AS WELL AS STRONG ACTIVITY IN THE REAL ESTATE AND FINANCIAL SECTORS. SO, THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE BUFFER THERE IN THE ECONOMY. THEY ALSO HAVE THE STRONG FISCAL BUFFERS TO PROP UP ECONOMIC GROWTH. JENNIFER: WE DO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE WITH YOU BUT REALLY FASCINATING INSIGHTS THAT YOU PROVIDED. ZAHABIA GUPTA, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF EMERGING MARKETS CREDIT RESEARCH AT STANDARD & POOR'S GLOBAL RATINGS JOINING US FROM DUBAI. THE U.S. AND EU HAVE OUTLINED PLANS THAT COULD REDUCE TARIFFS ON EUROPEAN CARS TO 15% WITHIN WEEKS AND POTENTIALLY OFFER DISCOUNTS ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM. THE JOINT STATEMENT ALSO INCLUDES COMMITMENTS TO COOPERATE ON ECONOMIC SECURITY, FOOD STANDARDS, AND DIGITAL TRADE. WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR PETER NAVARRO CREDITS THE BREAK THERE IN UKRAINE TALKS FOR PAVING THE WAY TO THE DEAL -- THE BREAKTHROUGH IN UKRAINE TALKS FOR PAVING THE WAY TO THE DEAL. > > I COULD THINK OF NO DEAL MORE IMPORTANT THAN WITH EUROPEAN UNION. THIS WAS LIKE A REALLY IMPORTANT MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB AND WE CLAIMED THAT AN PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TODAY. IN MANY WAYS, THE UKRAINE SITUATION HAS BEEN A TOTAL WAKE-UP CALL FOR EUROPE. JENNIFER: AND COMING UP, ELON MUSK'S SPACEX IS EYEING MIDDLE EAST CARRIERS FOR ITS IN-FLIGHT WI-FI. THE DETAILS ARE NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I AM JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. ELON MUSK HAS STEADILY ELBOWED HIS WAY INTO THE BOOMING MARKET FOR IN-FLIGHT WI-FI WITH HIS STARLINK SERVICE SIGNING A BLUE-CHIP CARIES FROM QATAR AIRWAYS UNITED AIRLINES BUT MUSK HAS HIS EYES ON AN EVEN BIGGER PRICE, THE MIDDLE EAST, HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST TRENDSETTING AIRLINES IN THE INDUSTRY AND A GLOBAL CONNECTING HUB FOR LONG-HAULER TRAVEL. JOINING US IS BLOOMBERG'S MIDDLE EAST AVIATION REPORTER. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WHY ARE DEALS WITH MIDDLE EAST AIRLINES SO IMPORTANT TO SPACEX FOR STARLINK EXPANSION, ESPECIALLY IF WE LOOK AT THE BREADTH OF HOW MANY SATELLITES THEY HAVE GLOBALLY? > > THESE WOULD BE HUGE MONETARY DEALS FOR SPACEX. THESE AIRLINES HAVE THE BIGGEST FLEETS IN THE WORLD AND EACH INSTALLATION WOULD COST A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY A MONTHLY FEE ON TOP OF IT FOR EVERY SEAT SO THESE COULD BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN, YOU KNOW, CASH FOR SPACEX AND STARLINK. ALSO, THESE AIRLINES, LIKE YOU SAID, THEY ARE TRENDSETTERS. THEY'VE BEEN PIONEERS IN FIRST CLASS AND BUSINESS PRODUCTS. IN A FEW YEARS, A LOT OF THE AIRLINES GLOBALLY TEND TO ADOPT A LOT OF THESE OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS, SO THIS COULD MEAN MORE AIRLINES VIEWING STARLINK IN-FLIGHT WI-FI AS A GOOD PRODUCT TO HAVE ON BOARD FOR CUSTOMERS. JENNIFER: IS STARLINK, IS STARLINK SEEING A LOT OF COMPETITION IN THE SPACE IN THE REGION? TALK ABOUT WHAT IS STANDING IN THE WAY OF POTENTIAL DEALS. > > WELL, THERE'S A FEW FACTORS. A BIG ONE IS FOR THE LARGEST CARRIER, EMIRATES, AND ITS SISTER CARRIER, FLY TO BUY, STARLINK IS NOT AUTHORIZED FOR USE IN THE UAE, IRAN, OR RUSSIA. THESE ARE SOME OF THE AIRSPACE IS SOME OF THESE AIRLINES FLY THE MOST, THESE ARE SOME OF THEIR MOST SUCCESSFUL ROUTES. CHINA IS ONE OF THEM. STARLINK IS NOT AUTHORIZED AND A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES. THIS KIND OF PUSH INTO THE MIDDLE EAST HAVE WHEN ELON MUSK WAS VISITING THE MIDDLE EAST WITH TRUMP. AT THAT TIME, SAUDI AUTHORIZED THE USE OF STARLINK. NOW THERE IS A RIFT BETWEEN ELON MUSK AND TRUMP. A LOT OF THESE CARRIERS ARE STATE OWNED SO POLITICS COULD GET IN THE WAY AND TO SOME OF THE STATE OWNED SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS LIKE THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT FUND OF SAUDI IS STARTING ITS OWN SATELLITE INTERNET COMPANY. SO AGAIN, THAT COULD ALSO PROVE TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR MUSK. JENNIFER: HERE IN AFRICA, WE TALK ABOUT STARLINK AND ITS CONTINUED PUSH INTO A NUMBER OF MARKETS. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GOALS AND THE PUSH THAT STARLINK IS TRYING TO MAKE, WHAT REALLY SETS IT APART FROM SOME OF THE OTHER PLAYERS IN THE SATELLITE SPACE THERE? > > I THINK THEY GOT TO THE GAME REALLY EARLY. THEY HAVE MORE SATELLITES THAN ANY OTHER PROVIDER SO THEY ARE JUST FASTER. WE HAVE SEEN A FEW DOCUMENTS WERE MAY BE SOME OF THE OTHER PROVIDERS ARE CHEAPER, BUT STARLINK REALLY IS THE FASTEST. IT'S ALSO THE INSTALLATION OF IT ON AN AIRCRAFT. IT DOES NOT NEED ANY SERIOUS MODIFICATION TO THE AIRPLANE. AND IT HAS A CATCHY NAME. IF YOU ANNOUNCE YOU HAVE A DEAL WITH STARLINK, PEOPLE TEND TO KNOW WHAT IT IS, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO MAY BE BOOK A TICKET OR KNOW THAT THIS CARRIERS TRYING TO INNOVATE OR DO SOMETHING NEW. JENNIFER: IT MEANS CONSISTENT WI-FI ON A FLIGHT, WHICH I THINK IS ALWAYS GOOD FOR PASSENGERS. LEEN AL-RASHDAN, BLOOMBERG'S MIDDLE EAST AVIATION REPORTER THERE IN DUBAI. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ONE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S BIGGEST GROCERS IS CHANGING ITS STRATEGY FOR GROWTH. WE WILL BRING YOU THE DETAILS ON THAT, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I AM JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. SOUTH AFRICA'S SPAR GROUP IS RESHAPING ITS GROWTH STRATEGY. AFTER YEARS OF INVESTING IN OVERSEAS EXPANSION, THE SUPERMARKET OPERATOR IS PULLING BACK ABROAD AND IS FREEING UP CAPITAL TO EXPAND BACK AT HOME. THE CEO TOLD ME FUTURE GROWTH LIES IN A BET ON HIGH-MARGIN SECTORS, CHALLENGING THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST PLAYER IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. \u266a SOUTH AFRICA HAS MORE RETAIL SPACE PER CAPITA THAN MOST EMERGING MARKETS. WITH MORE THAN 1400 SHOPPING MALLS DARTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY, RETAIL IS BIG BUSINESS. AND IN THE HUNT FOR GROWTH, MANY COMPANIES HAVE LOOKED TO OVERSEAS EXPANSION. THE SPAR GROUP IS ONE EXAMPLE. JUST OVER A DECADE AGO, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED LICENSES TO OPERATE SPAR WRITER SHOTS AND COMPANIES INCLUDING THE U.K., IRELAND, SWITZERLAND, AND SRI LANKA. I MET THE CEO AT SPAR'S DURBAN HEADQUARTERS. HE TOLD ME LOCAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS WERE PART OF THAT MOTIVATION. > > I THINK THAT WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SOUTH AFRICAN LEGISLATION WHICH LIMITED INVESTMENT MANAGERS FROM INVESTING TOO BIG A PORTFOLIO OUT OF SOUTH AFRICA, AND THEREFORE, MANY INVESTMENT MANAGERS WORK MERELY LOOKING FOR SOUTH AFRICAN COMPANIES TO BE PROXIES IN OTHER MARKETS. JENNIFER: SPAR IS LARGER A WHOLESALE BUSINESS. IN THE U.K., OVER 300 AND DEPEND ONLY ON SHOPS ALL CARRY THE SAME BRAND AND THEY BENEFIT FROM CENTRALIZED MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. IN EXCHANGE, BUT SPAR GROUP COLLECTS FEES AND IT LEVERAGES PURCHASING POWER WITH SUPPLIERS BUT IN RECENT YEARS, ITS AFRICAN REVENUE HAS FAR OUTPACED WHAT GETS FROM EUROPE. TAKE SWITZERLAND, A COUNTRY WITH STRONG TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES. GROCERIES THERE ARE OFTEN 50% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IN ITS EUROPEAN NEIGHBORS. WHEN HE TOOK OVER AS CEO JUST TWO YEARS AGO, HE DECIDED TO DIVEST THE SWISS AND U.K. BUSINESSES, MATERIALLY STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET. > > WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE BUSINESS IS IN THE U.K. ON THE BUSINESS IN SWITZERLAND, IT WAS ARGUED THAT THOSE BUSINESSES ARE SUBSCALE AND THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO THOSE BUSINESSES TO GET UP TO SCALE WOULD BE MISPLACED. JENNIFER: RETAIL ANALYST ALEC ABRAHAM ARGUES SPAR'S BIGGEST MISTAKE WAS TAKING HIS EYES OFF OF SOUTH AFRICA. > > WHEN YOU GO TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, THERE IS A VERY DIFFERENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND YOU NEED TO BE FOCUSED TO UNDERSTAND AND SUCCEED IN THAT MARKET. JENNIFER: BACK HOME, SPAR IS EXPANDING ITS DIY AND PHARMACY BUSINESS AND IS EXPANDING HIS LIQUOR OPERATIONS. > > WITH SPAR BEING WHERE IT IS AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN MARKET WHERE IT IS, WE WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR HOME MARKETS. JENNIFER: THAT'S BECAUSE LIQUOR MARKETS AND SOUTH AFRICA ARE EXPANDING TWICE AS FAST. LAST YEAR THEY GROUP ALMOST TWICE AS FAST AS OTHER MARKETS. > > WE HAVE BECOME THE SINGLE BIGGEST RETAIL BRAND -- LIQUOR BRAND IN THE COUNTRY. > > A HIGH-MARGIN, HIGH-GROWTH AREA IN AND OTHERWISE STRUGGLING CONSUMER MARKET. > > WE HAVE SHOWN THAT OUR BUSINESS HAS THE ABILITY, INDEPENDENT RETAILERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THE CHAINS, EMPOWERED BY US. AND WE ARE NOW THE SECOND SUPERMARKET BRAND IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS NO MEAN FEAT. JENNIFER: HAVING SPARRED WITH WHAT TODAY ARE SMALLER SUPERMARKET RIVALS, SWARTZ MAY BE READY TO TAKE OUR NUMBER ONE SHOPRITE IN WHAT COULD BE HIS TOUGHEST FIGHT YET. JENNIFER: THAT IS ONE OF THE STORIES WE WILL BE COVERING IN OUR MONTHLY SHOW NEXT AFRICA LATER TODAY. YOU CAN CATCH THE SHOW ON YOUR TERMINAL, HAVE BLOOMBERG.COM, AND ON TV.

BUT THAT IS WHERE WE WILL LEAVE IT FOR \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I AM JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. STICK WITH US FOR \"DAYBREAK: EUROPE.\" THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.
