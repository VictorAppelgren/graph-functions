  "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 The plan was for Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson to play about 1 1/2 quarters. Then Daniel Jones would play half a quarter.\n\nInstead, those figures ended up reversed after Richardson took a crunching sack from David Ojabo.\n\nRichardson had to leave Indianapolis' preseason opener Thursday night with a dislocated pinky on his throwing hand, and Jones replaced him earlier than expected in a 24-16 loss to Baltimore.\n\nRichardson was confident afterward that this wouldn't be a serious injury \u2014 but the Colts announced another one. Rookie cornerback Justin Walley didn't play Thursday because of a torn ACL.\n\nRichardson started and led the Colts to a field goal on their first offensive possession. On the next one, Ojabo had a clean run at him, and after the sack, Richardson jogged to the sideline and was replaced by Jones.\n\n\"I just looked down and I see my finger, different direction, and I'm like, 'Maybe I'm tripping,'\" Richardson said. \"I looked at it again, and it was definitely like that.\"\n\nRichardson tried to test whether he could throw after the injury.\n\n\"I tried immediately after, but I couldn't get the right squeeze on the ball,\" Richardson said. \"So I got it taped up.\"\n\nThat helped a little, but Richardson was ruled out.\n\nJones was supposed to start the second preseason game \u2014 against Green Bay on Aug. 16 \u2014 and get more of the playing time, but that could change after he played more than planned against the Ravens.\n\nThe Colts drafted Walley in the third round, and he seemed on his way to being a significant contributor before this injury.\n\n\"Huge blow,\" coach Shane Steichen said. \"He was making a ton of plays in practice too, before it happened. Just an unfortunate situation for him, obviously being a rookie and going through that.\"",

      "text": "Anthony Richardson injured as Colts fall to Ravens 24-16 in their preseason opener\nAnthony Richardson injured as Colts fall to Ravens 24-16 in their preseason opener\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 With Lamar Jackson sitting this one out, Baltimore\u2019s passing game sputtered for 60 minutes.\nThe Ravens needed a few big plays on special teams to pull through.\nLaJohntay Wester scored on an 87-yard punt return, fellow rookie Tyler Loop kicked a 52-yard field goal and Rasheen Ali added a long kickoff return to lift Baltimore to a 24-16 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday night.\n\u201cObviously, what LaJohntay did was awesome,\u201d coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cYou see Rasheen hit that kick return was good. That was big field position for us.\u201d\nColts quarterback Anthony Richardson exited on their second offensive possession of this preseason opener with a dislocated pinky on his throwing hand. Daniel Jones relieved him, and Riley Leonard came on in the second half to guide Indianapolis to its lone touchdown.\nRichardson went 2 for 3 for 21 yards in his brief outing. Jones went 10 of 21 for 144 yards, and Leonard was 12 of 24 for 92 yards with an interception.\n\u201cI made some plays on my feet, but I think I can\u2019t rely on that. In certain situations, you have to go through your reads and trust these guys,\u201d said Leonard, who led Notre Dame to the national title game last season. \u201cThey were getting open for me, so I just had to find them. You can\u2019t always just use that as a bailout escape route in the NFL. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning.\u201d\nCooper Rush started for the Ravens and threw for just 16 yards. Devin Leary passed for 43. Each was intercepted once.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to pass for more than 59 yards. I assure you,\u201d Harbaugh said.\nBut the Indianapolis quarterback situation was always the more compelling aspect of this game. After leading the Colts to a field goal on their opening drive, Richardson left with an injured finger in the middle of their second possession after being sacked by David Ojabo.\nJones came in and played the rest of the first half but could not lead the Colts to the end zone.\n\u201cGot to be ready to go. That\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSome good, some bad. Caught a rhythm there I think at points, and we were moving the ball well, executing, but a couple things here and there kept us from getting in the end zone.\u201d\nDerrick Henry joined Jackson in sitting this game out for the Ravens, but Keaton Mitchell showed he could be a useful backup for Baltimore this season. He broke away for a 23-yard run, then scored from 22 yards out two plays later to give the Ravens a 7-3 lead.\nWester, who was drafted in the sixth round this year out of Colorado, made it 14-3 with his touchdown on special teams. He apparently called his shot to some extent in practice.\n\u201cHe said he was going to take one to the crib, and he did it,\u201d Mitchell said.\nWester also contributed a 30-yard reception in the second half.\nAli added a 69-yard kickoff return late in the first half, setting up his own 2-yard TD run that gave the Ravens a 21-9 halftime lead.\nIndianapolis scored in the third quarter on a 1-yard run by Khalil Herbert.\nKicking update\nSpencer Shrader made three field goals for Indianapolis but also hit the left upright from 52 yards in the second quarter. Maddux Trujillo did not get to try a field goal but made an extra point in the second half.\nLoop, the rookie draft pick trying to replace Justin Tucker for Baltimore, missed his first field goal try from 46, but then connected in the fourth quarter to give the Ravens an eight-point lead.\nInjuries\nBaltimore DB Bilhal Kone was carted off in the first quarter with a severe knee injury that is expected to keep him out for the season.\nUp next\nBaltimore\u2019s next preseason game is at Dallas on Aug. 16. Indianapolis hosts Green Bay that same day.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"
