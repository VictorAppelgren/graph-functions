  "content": "Hotel Workers\u2019 Union Fights \u201cResort Fee Ripoff,\u201d Launches Website to Help Guests Avoid Unfair Fees at Curator Collection hotels\n\nUNITE HERE, the union for hotel workers and a critic of resort fees in the hospitality industry, is launching a website that shines a light on the prevalence of these unpopular and sneaky fees at hotels that make up the Curator Hotel & Resort Collection. Curator is a so-called \u201csoft brand\u201d of approximately 75 boutique and resort hotels and is majority-owned by real estate investors Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB).\n\nCuratorCollectionCon.org alerts guests booking travel at boutique hotels and resort properties to check if their hotel is part of the Curator Collection. If it is, the hotel is likely \u201ccharging you mandatory fees for services you might not want,\u201d like a photoshoot with a hotel-branded item or a 20% discount on a plush hotel mascot; or things you \u201cdidn\u2019t think you\u2019d have to pay extra for,\u201d like WiFi, fitness center access, or filtered drinking water taps.\n\n\"Resort fees can feel like a con: deceptive and unfair,\u201d concludes the website. Guests at Curator Collection hotels have an average of $40 in resort fees added to their bills each night, according to a UNITE HERE analysis, with fees at some Curator Collection properties reaching $100 nightly or more depending on time of booking.\n\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust launched Curator Hotels and Resorts Collection in 2020 and promises that \u201c[hotel] owners can reduce operating costs and boost their bottom lines.\u201d In February 2025, Pebblebrook CEO Jon Bortz said that Curator has implemented new practices that he called \u201cPebblebrook\u2019s DOGE.\u201d Curator Collection CEO Jennifer Barnwell has promised hotel owners \u201cno property inspections\u201d and \u201cno brand standards.\u201d Despite the promise of cost cuts and no property inspections or brand standards for hotel owners, Curator Collection membership has decreased by approximately 37 percent since launch. The website asks travelers, \u201cHotels aren\u2019t choosing the Curator Collection \u2013 Why should you?\u201d\n\nThe website features the following information and tools for Curator guests:\n\u2022 Examples of different names Curator Collection hotels use to describe their mandatory extra fees, such as \u201cAmenity fee\u201d or \u201cDestination fee\u201d;\n\u2022 A template resort fee refund letter, including state laws protecting consumers from having to buy goods or services they didn\u2019t request, and contact information for the management of each hotel in the Curator Collection;\n\nThe union reminds guests that hotels may have discretion to waive your resort fee charge upon complaint or request and encourages guests to visit the website and learn more about their consumer rights.",
