  "description": "The deal includes an option to make the transfer permanent for \u20ac30million (\u00a325.9m, $34.2m) at the end of the season.",
  "content": "Tottenham Hotspur have completed the loan signing of Joao Palhinha from Bayern Munich.\n\nThe Athletic reported the midfielder was set to undergo a medical in Germany on Friday ahead of joining the north London club. The deal includes an option to make the transfer permanent for \u20ac30million (\u00a325.9m, $34.2m) at the end of the season, and Spurs will cover his wages in full.\n\nPalhinha was made available by the German champions this summer, a year after he arrived from Fulham in deal worth \u20ac51m ($58.3m).\n\nHe impressed over two seasons at Craven Cottage but only started 10 matches for Vincent Kompany\u2019s side during the 2024-25 campaign, and made a further 15 appearances from the bench. Bayern further bolstered their midfield options with the signing of Tom Bischof from Hoffenheim this summer after the move was agreed in January.\n\nPalhinha played 79 times for Fulham over two years, winning player of the season in his debut campaign at in west London, having previously spent his entire career with Sporting CP and various loan spells to Portuguese clubs. His move to Spurs marks a second piece of business between the Premier League club and Bayern this summer, after Mathys Tel\u2019s loan was made permanent for \u20ac35m, plus \u20ac10m in potential bonuses, with the French striker signing a six-year deal.\n\nThe 30-year-old becomes Spurs\u2019 fifth signing of the summer transfer window following the \u00a355m arrival of Mohmammed Kudus from West Ham, alongside defenders Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai from Hajduk Split and Kawasaki respectively.\n\nTottenham will compete in the Champions League next season after winning the 2024-25 Europa League and appointed Thomas Frank as their new head coach following the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou.\n\nHad Joao Palhinha moved to Bayern Munich when he first expected to, in the final hours of the transfer window in the summer of 2023, his time at the club might have been different. They were crying out for a player of his profile \u2014 an ornery, physical ball-winner \u2014 and would surely have been a better side for his inclusion.\n\nAs it was, the year\u2019s delay in the transfer worked very much against him. By the time he arrived at Sabener Strasse, Joshua Kimmich had moved back into midfield from right-back, Aleksandar Pavlovic had properly emerged as a first-teamer, and the coach who had supported his signing \u2014 Thomas Tuchel \u2014 had been replaced by Vincent Kompany.\n\n It had also been expected that Leon Goretzka would leave the club, or at least remain on the squad\u2019s fringes. As it was, Goretzka was unexpectedly rehabilitated during Palhinha\u2019s first season under Kompany, and became a further obstacle to a starting position.\n\nEven if he rarely played well for Bayern and never established a proper rhythm, it\u2019s fairer to describe Palhinha as the wrong player, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, rather than just as a midfielder who was not good enough. Spurs, essentially, are profiting from a muddled situation, rather than snapping up an inferior product.",

      "text": "Tottenham Hotspur have completed the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham United.\nThe Athletic reported on Wednesday that a deal worth around \u00a355million ($74.7m) had been agreed between the two clubs, with Kudus set to sign a six-year contract. Spurs had an initial bid of \u00a350m rejected by West Ham, as reported by The Athletic on July 5.\nAdvertisement\nThe agreed fee is less than the buyout clause inserted in Kudus\u2019 West Ham contract, which was active only for the first 10 days of July. The clause set a price of \u00a380million ($108m) for teams on the continent, \u00a385m for those in the Premier League and \u00a3120m for those in Saudi Arabia, while his deal at the London Stadium was valid until the summer of 2028.\nThe 24-year-old has been a key player for West Ham since he joined the club from Ajax in a deal worth \u20ac41m plus \u20ac3m in add-ons in 2023. He scored 14 goals \u2014 eight in the league \u2014 for the club in his debut season, alongside nine assists.\nHis output slowed in the subsequent campaign, with five goals and four assists in 35 matches as he played across multiple position\u2019s in West Ham\u2019s attack. Two of his goals came under Graham Potter, after the former Chelsea head coach succeeded Julen Lopetegui in January.\nKudus becomes Spurs\u2019 first addition to the squad since the appointment of Thomas Frank as head coach last month. Prior to his arrival, Mathys Tel signed for the club permanently for a fee worth up to \u20ac45m following a six-month spell during the second half of the 2024-25 campaign. The Athletic reported on Thursday Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White is to undergo a medical at Spurs as Frank looks to bolster his new squad.\nTottenham have been actively looking to strengthen their attack, having shown interest in reuniting Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo with head coach Frank, but the 25-year-old informed the north London club of his preference to join Manchester United. Spurs also made an inquiry for Bournemouth\u2019s Antoine Semenyo, but the winger extended his contract with the South Coast club until 2030.\n\u2018A significant coup\u2019 for Spurs\nAnalysis from Tottenham correspondent Jay Harris\nSpurs have spent the first few weeks of the transfer window trying to sign a right winger. However, Bryan Mbeumo has made it clear he wants to join Manchester United and Antoine Semenyo signed a new long-term contract with Bournemouth. Kudus might not have been their first-choice target but he is still a significant coup for new head coach Thomas Frank.\nAdvertisement\nFrank loves players who are positionally versatile. Kudus has spent the majority of his time with West Ham United on the right wing but he operates as a No 10 for Ghana. Frank could use the 24-year-old as a threat cutting inside onto his stronger left foot or as a powerful and dynamic dribbler in tight central areas.\nTottenham\u2019s squad struggled to cope with the demands of the Premier League and the Europa League last season so it was crucial that they boosted their numbers this summer. Mathys Tel arrived permanently, after spending the second half of last season on loan from Bayern Munich, but he only turned 20 in April and is still raw. Kudus has a lot of room for growth but is far more experienced and proven.\nIt will be interesting to see how Kudus\u2019 arrival impacts Brennan Johnson and Dejan Kulusevski. Johnson was Tottenham\u2019s top scorer in all competitions last season and he scored the winning goal in the Europa League final. Johnson primarily plays on the right and Frank tried to sign him when he was in charge of Brentford. Will Kudus replace Johnson as the first-choice right winger or will he take over Kulusevski\u2019s playmaking responsibilities in the middle of the pitch? Spurs have a lot of attacking talent at their disposal and it will be fascinating to see how Frank will effectively combine them.\n(Bryn Lennon/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Bayern Munich have announced the signing of midfielder Tom Bischof from Hoffenheim on a pre-contract agreement.\nThe 19-year-old German youth international will join the club on a free transfer in the summer.\nHe has signed four-year deal that will see him stay at the Allianz Arena until 2029.\n\u201cTom Bischof is one of the biggest German talents, who\u2019s also attracted international interest,\u201d Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAt the age of just 19, he\u2019s already gained a lot of experience in professional football, in the Bundesliga as well as in the DFB Cup and Europa League. Tom is an ideal fit for our philosophy as a technically gifted midfielder.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased he\u2019s decided to take his next steps at FC Bayern. Tom has all the attributes to establish himself at the highest level.\u201d\nNew arrival for 2025/26 season: #FCBayern sign Tom Bischof. \ud83d\udd34\u26aa\nAll information: https://t.co/vMfnYLP5Us pic.twitter.com/X6kRH29EOe\n\u2014 FC Bayern (@FCBayernEN) January 21, 2025\nBischof has made 24 appearances in all competitions for Hoffenheim this season, including 16 in the Bundesliga where he has scored two goals.\nWho is Bischof and why is he so highly rated?\nA Hoffenheim academy graduate who made his Bundesliga debut at 16, Bischof has represented Germany at U16, U17 and U18 level.\nThe watchable, left-footed central midfielder has started 15 Bundesliga games for TSG this season and has also been ever-present during the club\u2019s Europa League campaign.\nHe has shone in a team that have struggled and has been the outstanding performer in a side that sit 15th in the Bundesliga, one place above the relegation playoff place.\nNo surprise, because Bischof is generally considered one of the country\u2019s biggest prospects of the coming generation. A tenacious but talented all-round midfielder, he won the Fritz Walter Gold Medal in the U19s \u2014 given to the best German player in their age group \u2014 and is also a set-piece expert.\nIn completing the transfer, Bayern will feel that they have potentially constructed a central midfield to last most of the next decade. Munich-born Aleksandar Pavlovic, 20, is already a full German international and an integral part of Vincent Kompany\u2019s side, and a potential partnership with Bischof feels both balanced with and without the ball and capable of providing outstanding support to the attacking part of the team.\nAdvertisement\nBayern already have a clutch of talented young players around whom their new era will be build. Jamal Musiala (21) is already a star, of course, and Michael Olise (23) has had a terrific first season in Germany. Mathys Tel (19) will surely realise his enormous potential in attack at some point, while Alphonso Davies \u2014 still 24 \u2014 is likely to sign a new contract and commit his future to the club in the coming days.\nBischof can be added to that group as soon as he arrives, with Bayern looking increasingly well-stocked for the years ahead.\n(Alex Grimm/Getty Images)"

      "text": "To reach Thomas Frank\u2019s hometown of Frederiksvaerk, around 50 kilometres north of Copenhagen and where his mother still lives, The Athletic caught two trains and a bus from the Danish capital. The bus cuts through forests and fields, before it trundles past the glittering water of the Roskilde Fjord. It stops at the side of a motorway, and from there, the clubhouse of Frederiksvaerk (FFK) is accessed through a small tunnel.\nAdvertisement\nIt is a place still very much close to Frank\u2019s heart. When the new Tottenham Hotspur head coach returns to Denmark, he runs past the club\u2019s pitches.\n\u201cThe last time he was here in March, I was sitting upstairs in the office,\u201d Martin Holm Jensen, a senior figure at FFK, tells The Athletic. \u201cI could hear somebody walking on the stones outside the front gate. He was standing down there looking onto the pitch and knocking on the window, so he came up and said hello.\u201d\nFrank has not forgotten any of his friends from Frederiksvaerk. When he turned 50 in October 2023, he took a group of 35 of them to the Spanish island of Mallorca to celebrate, some he had known since childhood. They played padel, drank cocktails and reminisced about the roles they had all played in Frank\u2019s coaching career, which started in the remote Danish town with a population of just over 10,000.\n\u201cThomas does everything he can to be the same person,\u201d says Anders Bay, who has known Frank for over a decade. \u201cAt the start of every year, he always texts me to arrange to meet up when the season has finished. If you were a typical top manager, you would want to sit in a room by yourself or be with your family in your spare time but that\u2019s not Thomas. He remembers everybody.\u201d\nFrank has spent the majority of the last seven years in charge of Brentford but has accepted the biggest challenge of his career. In June, he signed a three-year contract to replace Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham.\nFrank earned \u00a3100 ($130) from his first coaching job. Now, he is on a multi-million-pound salary at Spurs, who have a 60,000-seater stadium and will play in the Champions League next season.\nThe Athletic has been to Denmark to trace the earliest steps in Frank\u2019s journey to north London.\n\u201cFrederiksvaerk is a small town with a harbour but not many jobs, so most people leave to work in the city,\u201d says Jensen.\nTheir football club, FFK, was formed in November 2004 when Frederiksvaerk Boldklub (FB) and Brederod merged. They compete in the seventh tier of Danish football.\nFrank progressed through FB\u2019s youth ranks and played in midfield for their first team in the 1990s. When he was 20, he was encouraged to become a coach by Jesper Olsen \u2014 no relation to the former Manchester United and Ajax winger of the same name. He was given a tracksuit and 1,000 Danish kroner, which amounts to just over \u00a3100.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cMy father was part of the board and became youth-team chairman,\u201d says Jacob Olsen, Jesper\u2019s son. \u201cMy father tried to recruit senior players to become coaches. Thomas volunteered because he wanted to help young people and give something back.\u201d\nFrank worked alongside Jacob Hansen, with whom he remains close, and Lis Westberg Pedersen. The latter captained Denmark to victory at the 1971 Women\u2019s World Cup in Mexico.\nFrank studied for a sports degree at the University of Copenhagen, where he wrote about his experiences coaching FB\u2019s under-eights and under-12s. Frank coached Jacob, who describes him as \u201chuman, ambitious and with his heart in the right place\u201d. They still keep in touch and the Olsens visited him in London in December.\n\u201cHe used the experiences he gained from university to develop us,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cHe focused on everyone. Thomas and Lis were two fantastic people who created joy and a well-functioning team. He introduced the \u2018trick of the week\u2019, which the players loved.\n\u201cThomas says the two biggest games of his career were the billion-dollar match for promotion to the Premier League at Wembley against Swansea in 2021 and the match for the Zealand Championship between Frederiksvaerk and Brondby. We beat Brondby 2-0. It was a joke but he remembers people. It was as if nothing had changed when we saw him. We enjoyed our trip to Brentford but it was clear he appreciated it too.\u201d\nThe pitches where Frank started his coaching career no longer exist as they were left behind when FFK was created. The grass has overgrown and is covered with trees and bushes.\nFrank left Frederiksvaerk in 1999 to join Hvidovre, a club in the Copenhagen suburbs who won the Danish top flight three times between 1966 and 1981. Peter Schmeichel represented them before he went on to play for Brondby, Manchester United and the national team.\nFrank was recruited by Ebbe Bay, the youth team chairman at the time. He worked alongside Kim Hallberg, who now holds a senior role at the Danish Football Association (DBU), and Brian Riemer, who went on to become Frank\u2019s assistant at Brentford and is now Denmark\u2019s head coach.\nAdvertisement\nTeddy Hebo is Hvidovre\u2019s chairman and has been associated with them for more than 60 years. When Frank first joined, Hebo watched training one evening.\n\u201cThere was almost no light on the pitch but Thomas was training with the players and it fascinated me,\u201d Hebo says after taking The Athletic on a guided tour of the club\u2019s facilities, pointing out the pitches where Frank spent so many hours. \u201cHe had this infectious energy that he transferred to the squad. He was dynamic, engaged and dedicated.\n\u201cHe came over to me and asked, \u2018Who are you?\u2019. We talked and established a good relationship. Then he started training my son Thomas and we became even closer.\u201d\nFrank spent five years with Hvidovre and juggled coaching duties with a degree in psychology. He went travelling to New Zealand and Australia with his wife Nanna before they became parents for the first time. Money was tight and there were moments when he had to consider if full-time coaching was the right option for his family.\n\u201cThomas got paid so little you wouldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Hebo says. \u201cAround \u00a31,000 a year. I would invite Thomas and Kim over for red meat and red wine because that was a way to recognise their work.\n\u201cThomas and Nanna were young people who worked hard. She studied to become a psychologist and then worked for a children\u2019s association. The success of Thomas is his wife. She has been his strongest supporter but challenges him. When he goes a little bit wild, Nanna brings him back on track.\u201d\nFrank left Hvidovre in 2004 to become an integrated talent development (ITU) coach at second-division side B93. The ITU scheme was created by the DBU, which agreed to pay part of a coach\u2019s salary at some of the best academies in Denmark. That coach would then focus on individual player development. It is similar to the newly created role of an individual development coach at Spurs.\nAdvertisement\nJohan Lange was a coach at B93, after he had spent time in their academy as a child, and has had a big say in Frank\u2019s career. In November 2023, Lange was appointed as Tottenham\u2019s sporting director. The 45-year-old played a crucial role in the process of hiring Frank from Brentford. Over 20 years after they first crossed paths at a small club near the centre of Copenhagen, they have been reunited. Frank only spent 12 months with B93 but made a significant impact.\n\u201cThomas had to be creative because we didn\u2019t have a lot of money or the right clothing and equipment,\u201d Frank Nielsen, B93\u2019s sports manager, tells The Athletic in a building next to their clubhouse, which is being renovated. \u201cHe helped us to structure the way we trained players and developed what we call the \u2018red line\u2019. You sit down with all the coaches of the different age groups and make sure you are coaching them in the same way and are all heading in the right direction.\u201d\nFrank\u2019s work with Hvidovre and B93 caught the attention of Birger Jorgensen at second-tier side Lyngby. The first time Jorgensen met Frank was at a meeting of Denmark\u2019s coaches that the DBU hosted every summer in Vejle.\nLange moved to Lyngby in 2005 and Frank followed shortly after. They worked together alongside future Denmark head coach Kasper Hjulmand and Niels Frederiksen, who has just won the Polish top flight with Lech Poznan. They all shared a small office on the bottom floor of the clubhouse, which is now where the media and communications staff are based.\n\u201cLygnby went bankrupt in 2001 and we had to rebuild it,\u201d says Jorgensen, who is leading Lyngby\u2019s stadium redevelopment. \u201cAfter that, this club was like a laboratory. Kasper moved into the first team, Johan Lange had the reserves and then Thomas became the ITU coach. Kenneth Weber, who is now an assistant with the Danish national team, was here too.\u201d\nLyngby\u2019s crop of talented coaches would watch Champions League games together and took inspiration from Barcelona. Jorgensen visited Frank at Brentford\u2019s training ground in May and there was a chart on the wall in the canteen which measured how many chances they were creating and conceding from set pieces.\n\u201cIn that period, we didn\u2019t think set pieces were part of football,\u201d Jorgensen says. \u201cWe wanted to have the ball all the time. It\u2019s Thomas\u2019 personality that catches you but he has progressed tactically. He is clever to take the next level and follow how football has developed. He can adapt to different clubs.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that (Frank and Lange) have joined Spurs. I texted them both: \u2018It is crazy that you guys were here and are now there. I can\u2019t advise you anymore, but my final piece of advice is, \u201cWin every weekend\u201d\u2018.\u201d\nDuring Frank\u2019s time at Lygnby, Andreas Bjelland was a talented centre-back in their academy. They remain close and this year Bjelland called Frank for advice when he considered retiring.\n\u201cThomas is a kind person,\u201d Bjelland, who is now an assistant coach at Lyngby, says after accidentally interrupting The Athletic\u2019s conversation with Jorgensen. \u201cHe has an interest in you as a person, not just as a player. He knows how to get the best out of you.\n\u201cHe was good at challenging me and making me grow. When I was younger, I didn\u2019t have a dream. He pushed me and gave me direction.\u201d\nBjelland went on to play for Nordsjaelland, Twente and moved to Brentford in 2015. Within a year, he had been reunited with Frank, who had been appointed as an assistant to head coach Dean Smith.\n\u201cI was happy to see him,\u201d Bjelland says. \u201cThe English culture was about fighting and winning duels. Thomas came in and made tactical adjustments. We played shape games of 11 v zero to see the patterns in play, to understand if I have the ball, then we want to go here, which way to turn my body\u2026 we had never done that before.\u201d\nAfter three years with Lyngby, Frank was interested in becoming the head coach of Denmark\u2019s under-16s and under-17s. Hallberg, his former assistant at Hvidovre, had moved to the DBU and recommended him to then-general secretary Jim Stjerne Hansen.\nFrank impressed Hansen during a meeting at their offices. The negotiations between the DBU and Lyngby were over a modest fee compared to the \u00a310million ($13.5m) Spurs paid to take Frank and his backroom staff from Brentford.\n\u201cI asked Thomas for a copy of his employment contract and he said it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d says Hansen, who was general secretary from 1988 until 2014. \u201cHe just got paid every month and that was it. Somebody from Lyngby called me and said: \u2018Jim, you have to pay \u00a315,000 for Thomas\u2019. I replied, \u2018Can you send me a copy of his contract?\u2019. I never heard from them again.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDenmark topped their group at the Under-17 European Championship in 2011 with victories against Serbia, France and an England side that included Raheem Sterling and Jordan Pickford. They lost against Germany in the semi-finals.\nLater that year, they played in the Under-17 World Cup for the first time, but finished bottom of a group containing Brazil, Ivory Coast and Australia. Brazil\u2019s captain was future Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos, while Souleymane Coulibaly scored a hat-trick for Ivory Coast against Frank\u2019s team. That name may ring a bell among Spurs fans: Coulibaly finished as the tournament\u2019s top goalscorer, which led to a move to Spurs. Sadly, he never made an appearance for the first team.\nFrank helped to develop future Spurs midfielders Christian Eriksen and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, as well as Arsenal\u2019s new signing Christian Norgaard. He worked with a lot of the Danish squad that lost to England in the semi-final of the senior European Championship in 2021.\nFrank had a close relationship with Hansen. He would regularly visit his boss at home and \u201cloved\u201d eating the platters of cheese Hansen\u2019s wife prepared. He took over the under-19s and asked about stepping up to the under-21s. Yet, he still had a lot to learn.\n\u201cHe was a little bit na\u00efve because he wanted to play like Barcelona,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cThomas has a close friendship with Albert Capellas, the former director of Barcelona\u2019s academy, who then became his assistant at Brondby.\n\u201cThomas was in favour of possession, possession and possession. He came back from a game against Norway and said, \u2018Jim, we had 65 per cent of the ball\u2019. But they lost 2-1.\n\u201cWhen Thomas then worked with me at Brondby, he said, \u2018I admit that this is about results and nothing else matters\u2019.\u201d\nWhile Frank was in charge of Denmark\u2019s youth teams, Bay contacted him about working as a pundit for the television company Channel Nine. Frank made multiple appearances on their shows and developed a relationship with Bay.\nBay worked alongside Aldo Petersen, who became Brondby\u2019s chairman in 2013. That summer, Frank was appointed as their head coach. Bay was their new head of communications and marketing. Hansen released Frank from his contract with Denmark without a fee.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople were saying he was just a youth-team coach,\u201d Bay, who is now the head of sport for the Walt Disney Company in Denmark, says. \u201cBut he likes to be challenged and get new things into his head. He is curious, empathetic and attentive.\n\u201cHe is interested in other people. He had one-on-one meetings with all the members of staff. He is so open-minded and being with people inspires him. He is very good at getting people around him \u2014 staff, players and the board.\n\u201cHe wants to feel what\u2019s going on in a player\u2019s life. We had Johan Elmander playing for us. Johan lost his father and Thomas said, \u2018Whatever you need, time off, prioritise your family\u2019. But he is not just a nice guy. He wants to win.\u201d\nBay experienced Frank\u2019s relentless desire to win on a trip to Dubai in 2014. Brondby\u2019s staff competed against each other in a three-v-three beach football tournament where they were split into four teams. Bay was paired with Frank and then sporting director Per Rud. They won the competition but Bay was unhappy with their approach.\n\u201cI went to the bar in the evening and I was thinking about what happened because there were times when I was free but they didn\u2019t pass the ball to me,\u201d Bay says. \u201cI confronted Per and Thomas and said, \u2018Guys, what the f*** was going on?\u2019. They laughed and said, \u2018We wanted to win!\u2019.\n\u201cHe is ambitious and has a lot of self-confidence but is reflective. There were some tough times at Brondby. He didn\u2019t win any of his first seven games. But he just worked harder. He might have a difficult start at Spurs but he is a survivor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people remember you for who you are and not what you are, but Thomas prefers to be remembered as a successful manager rather than a great human being.\u201d\nBrondby only finished in ninth, five points above the relegation zone, the season before Frank joined. He guided them to back-to-back top-four finishes but left towards the end of his third season in charge. Brondby\u2019s chairman, Jan Bech Andersen, had criticised Frank on an online forum using the alias Oscar, his son\u2019s name. Frank held a press conference after the news broke and resigned. Andersen stepped down but remained on the board. The Athletic contacted Andersen for this piece but he did not want to comment.\nAdvertisement\nA year after leaving the DBU, Hansen joined Brondby\u2019s board and was there when Frank left. \u201cWe made two mistakes at Brondby with the coaches \u2014 one was Kent Nielsen and the other was Thomas,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the pressure at Brondby is always tough. When the results are not there, the first thing they look at is the coach. What happened with Thomas and the owner is a sad end to the story.\u201d\n\u201cPeople see Thomas as a nice and inclusive person but if you take advantage of him once or you don\u2019t respect him then you are out,\u201d Bay says.\n\u201cThomas is not someone who compromises his values,\u201d according to Hebo. \u201cHe hates bulls*** and is not afraid of speaking up. It is about hard work and humbleness for Thomas. It\u2019s not just words. He lives with it.\u201d\nSeven months after resigning from Brondby, Frank became an assistant at Brentford following a meeting in a hotel with then co-directors of football Phil Giles and Rasmus Ankersen. The long-term plan was for him to succeed Smith but nothing was guaranteed.\n\u201cThomas moved his family from Copenhagen to London for a job which I\u2019m sure did not pay that well,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cI met him in London and we had a cup of coffee together. He said, \u2018It\u2019s tough with a wife and kids who are going to school here in a different system from Denmark but we will give it a try and see how it develops\u2019. I admire that he took a risk and it has taken him to Tottenham.\u201d\nWhen Frank became Brentford\u2019s head coach in October 2018, he got back in touch with Hebo, now the former managing director of the Danish and Norwegian division of Eli Lilly, an American pharmaceutical company. He was senior vice president for corporate human Eli Lilly at Danish firm Lundbeck, where he was responsible for talent development, and has written books about leadership.\nAfter losing eight of his first 10 games in charge, Frank started to ring Hebo every Friday evening to discuss his challenges. Hebo encouraged Frank to set career goals and they came up with the acronym PATH \u2014 purpose, ambition, togetherness and hard work.\n\u201cThomas has invested so much in leadership,\u201d Hebo says. \u201cOne of the areas we worked on is called \u2018constructive cynicism\u2019. When you\u2019re in a top job, you need to make difficult decisions and you need to deliver them in the right way. He has developed that significantly. He always asks for input before he makes decisions but is not afraid of making tough calls.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe is still the same person he was when we worked at Hvidovre but he needs to manage his energy levels. He keeps going but sometimes you need to slow down. Thomas likes to chase lots of rabbits but sometimes you need to choose just one that you want to catch.\u201d\nFrank has only come close to running out of energy on one occasion. Towards the end of the 2019-20 season, Brentford won eight matches in a row to boost their chances of automatic promotion from the Championship but lost their final two games. They reached the play-off final but lost after extra time to west London rivals Fulham.\n\u201cA couple of days later, he was having breakfast with me by the sea and he was crushed,\u201d Bay says. \u201cIt was devastating. He has this huge capacity and he can manage so many things but the lights went out. You cannot convince the players, staff and fans if you are not energised. But then, 10 days later, he was back. He was more idealistic about how to play football 10 years ago and now it\u2019s about winning. He doesn\u2019t care if they play amazing football if they lose.\u201d\nBrentford won the play-off final at the second attempt under Frank to achieve promotion to the Premier League. They memorably beat Arsenal 2-0 on the opening day of the 2021-22 season, their first game in the top flight for 74 years, and went on to finish 13th.\nFrank recorded two top-half finishes in four seasons with Brentford. He missed out on the Chelsea job last summer to Enzo Maresca and was a potential replacement for Erik ten Hag at Manchester United. Now he has got his opportunity at a bigger club thanks to Spurs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the biggest jobs a Danish coach will ever have,\u201d Bjelland says. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for him and proud of what he has done. He has earned it.\u201d\n\u201cI contacted him when he was working at Brondby because I work with underdeveloped kids and one of them was a big fan,\u201d Nielsen says. \u201cThomas made sure I could take him to see the facilities and watch the team train. He has never forgotten where he comes from. He is humble but it will be interesting to see how Tottenham will change him because the environment is much bigger.\n\u201cBut it is unbelievable how he has gone from coaching at our little club to one of the biggest teams in the world.\u201d\n(Top photos: Nick Potts, Naomi Baker/Getty Images; design: Kelsea Petersen/The Athletic)"
