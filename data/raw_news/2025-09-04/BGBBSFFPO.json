  "title": "Microsoft made a free YouTube Premium workaround, but I'm keeping my paid sub anyway",
  "description": "Edge Canary brings two of YouTube Premium's biggest benefits for free, but after testing it out, I'm sticking with my paid YouTube subscription. Here's why.",
  "content": "A couple of days ago, Microsoft Edge\u2019s latest Canary version added a new and very intriguing feature: video background playback. While the feature seemed cool and innocuous at first glance, we discovered that it could be used to play YouTube videos in the background without paying for a Premium subscription. Better yet, Microsoft Edge also has a built-in ad-blocker that can remove ads while watching YouTube. A plus B equal the two most useful perks from a YouTube Premium subscription can now be had for free with Edge.\n\nThis all sounds too good to be true, so I immediately put it to the test to see how well it works. It actually does. I played several videos without encountering a single ad, and switched back and forth between tabs and apps, without breaking a sweat; the video kept going in the background. I even turned my screen off, and the video continued playing.\n\nI watch YouTube on more than just one phone\n\nI watch YouTube in the browser on my computer when I\u2019m working, on my phone(s) when I\u2019m on the go, and on my Google TV Streamer when I\u2019m at home. Because of my work here on Android Authority, I also switch between a dozen phones and tablets during any given week. So any Premium hack, be it using the Brave browser, an ad-blocker, ReVanced, or whatever other underground alternative is hot these days, has to work across all of my platforms and all of my devices. If I\u2019m spending precious time setting it up on everything I use and troubleshooting it, it\u2019s not worth it for me.\n\nI\u2019m probably an extreme case, but I\u2019m also part of a YouTube family plan, so I\u2019d also have to get my husband to switch along with me, and stay on top of any workaround. I\u2019d also be constantly blamed if something stops working. No, my friend, no; it\u2019s not worth the effort. I\u2019d rather keep paying for Premium.\n\nTwo perks do not equal all the perks\n\nWhile the current Microsoft Edge workaround brings two of YouTube Premium\u2019s best features \u2014 ad-blocking and background playback \u2014 it can\u2019t emulate the rest of my subscription\u2019s perks. I don\u2019t often download a video to watch offline, but I rely on smart offline downloads for those times when I\u2019m in a bad network area and just want some entertainment without having planned it beforehand. I use Continue Watching all the time to resume a video on my TV after I start it on my phone, or the other way around. I can\u2019t live without queues on mobile, especially when I\u2019m researching a specific topic; I just find several videos, queue them up, and start playing. Without Premium, this is only possible on the web.\n\nThere are other little-known YouTube Premium perks like watching together on a Google Meet call or using Premium controls, but the most significant benefit, if you ask me, is paying the creators I love. There was a brief period of time when I was involved with Android Authority\u2019s YouTube channel, and those months really taught me how exhausting, ungrateful, and demanding it is to make a single YouTube video. And any creator will tell you that people who watch YouTube ads barely pay the bills; they get much more out of Premium subscribers who watch their videos. So if, by paying a few bucks a month, I can help pay all the incredible creators that I\u2019m watching, then it\u2019s a win for me, not a loss.\n\nWho knows when YouTube will block or punish this\n\nYouTube\u2019s fight against ad blockers is an ongoing saga. Every few months, if not weeks, we hear of a new measure that YouTube is taking to force people to drop their ad-blocking extensions or apps. A three-strike policy, interminable hour-long ads, unskippable ads, playing ads despite ad blockers \u2014 YouTube has tried it all. And to me, looking from the outside in, it feels like people who have decided to adopt the workaround life keep playing whack-a-mole with YouTube\u2019s latest aggression method.\n\nEven background playback has not been immune to YouTube\u2019s draconian influence. Xiaomi had to disable video playback with the screen off from its Video toolbox in early 2024, and while the company didn\u2019t point fingers, everyone knows why that was vetoed. Nothing has happened to browsers that offer a similar feature, like Microsoft Edge Canary, Samsung Internet, and Brave, but who knows how long they\u2019ll be able to escape YouTube\u2019s ire. I\u2019m not a betting woman, but I\u2019m pretty sure that if Google came knocking, all of these companies would disable that option or restrict it on YouTube.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the final coffin for any fleeting impulse I\u2019ve had to cancel Premium and adopt the workaround lifestyle. It wouldn\u2019t pay my favorite creators, it would be more time-consuming to set up and maintain across all my devices, it would annoy my husband, it wouldn\u2019t offer all the perks I\u2019m used to, and it might be blocked or limited by Google on a whim. It is just not worth it; I\u2019d rather keep paying for YouTube Premium.",

Learn more.\nXiaomi is removing a popular MIUI feature from old and new phones alike\nMarch 11, 2024\n- Xiaomi has removed a feature that allowed its users to play YouTube in the background.\n- The company says it was to meet compliance requirements.\n- This is likely because Google wanted to protect the paid YouTube Premium service.\nXiaomi has removed a feature that previously allowed MIUI devices to play audio from YouTube videos even with the screen off.\nThe company made the announcement on March 7 via their Mi Fans Telegram channel, citing compliance requirements for the change.\nIn their post, Xiaomi notified users, many of whom were likely caught off guard, that it has removed the \u201cPlay video sound with screen off\u201d function in the video toolbox feature and the \u201cTurn off screen\u201d function in the game toolbox feature with recent updates. These features were first introduced with MIUI 12.\nWhich devices are affected?\nAffected devices include popular flagship smartphones, including the Xiaomi 14, 13, 13 Pro, and 12T, among others. See the screenshot from Xiaomi for a complete list of system versions, device models, and security versions.\nWhy Xiaomi is removing the feature now?\nAs the company\u2019s Telegram post implies, the change is likely being implemented due to Google cracking down on services that offer YouTube Premium features for free.\nAs part of a $13.99 monthly subscription service, YouTube Premium offers users exclusive benefits like ad-free watching, video downloading, and, of course, background video playback with other apps open or with the screen switched off.\nConsidering that a competitor was offering one of YouTube Premium\u2019s paid features for free, it makes sense that Google would frown upon it. However, it is interesting that Xiaomi is only now removing this feature despite YouTube Premium offering it for years.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nYouTube Premium offers many more perks that I didn't know I was paying for\nJuly 5, 2025\nI\u2019ve been subscribed to YouTube Premium for many years now, and yet I didn\u2019t know what I was exactly paying for. In my mind, I always associated Premium with an ad-free experience; being able to get rid of all those pesky long and interrupting ads before or while watching a video is alone worth the price. Adding the family benefits for my husband, and the fact that this works everywhere, including on our TVs, makes it more of a no-brainer.\nEven though I don\u2019t use them often, I also knew that Premium gave me the option for background play, picture-in-picture, and YouTube Music Premium \u2014 all perks that many of our Android Authority readers seem to love.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know, though, was that Premium packs some smaller but very useful advantages and features throughout the experience. And those\u2026 well, those, I\u2019ve been relying on for years, and I had no idea they weren\u2019t available for free watchers. I had taken them for granted, and it was only when I used YouTube on a secondary free account that I noticed they were missing.\nThe extremely handy \u2018Continue watching\u2019\nIt\u2019s been a couple of years since YouTube introduced \u2018Continue watching,\u2019 a feature I never thought I used that often until I didn\u2019t have it anymore on my secondary account. What this does is essentially pick up the video I was watching on one device and offer the suggestion to continue it on the second. So if I\u2019m checking out our hands-on with the Nothing Phone 3 on my desktop and I step away for a bit, I can open YouTube on my phone to find the video already there on the bottom right, queued up for me.\nI didn't know I used 'Continue watching' this much, until I switched to an account that doesn't have it.\nThis works across phones, web, and TV, and saves me time having to dig into my watch history or search to find that video I was just watching. It also feels freeing in a way, because I know I don\u2019t have to stay in front of my TV or computer to finish watching a video; I can pick it up where I left off on my phone.\nWhen I used my free YouTube account, this option wasn\u2019t there. I immediately noticed that YouTube wasn\u2019t offering my paused video as the first suggestion to watch, and I thought it was a bug or a setting I hadn\u2019t enabled, but after looking into it, I realized it was only available for YouTube Premium subscribers. This is what sent me into this rabbit hole, looking for other similarly niche but practical Premium-only features.\nQueuing up videos on mobile\nI waited years for YouTube to gain queue management support, and when it first came to the web experience, I was thrilled. Then I waited even longer to see it on mobile, and now I can\u2019t imagine using YouTube without it. When I\u2019m researching a new trip destination, watching videos about a new phone or service for work, or deep-diving into robot mowers to pick one for my new garden, I tend to do a search on YouTube, scroll through all the results, and queue up the ones I want to watch. Then, I sit back and enjoy as it goes through them one by one. Queues are like my personal curation system, and they\u2019ve become integral to my YouTube experience.\nI assumed, though, that just like queues on a desktop, these were available for everyone. Turns out that Google has kept this option exclusive for Premium subscribers only on mobile phones and tablets. It feels like an aleatory choice, and it sucks that free users don\u2019t get it. The best way to circumvent this is to create a temporary playlist and dump videos in it, watch them, then empty it when you\u2019re done, i.e., not as practical as a simple queue.\nPremium Controls \u2014 it\u2019s in the name\nI don\u2019t always use Premium Controls because Google has made them annoying to enable and there\u2019s no way to force them to show up by default on all videos. However, they do come in handy when I\u2019m watching a video while cooking or working. They\u2019re simple and generally big buttons that distill YouTube\u2019s essence to two rows of icons: playback controls and frequent actions.\nTo me, the most important ones are the speed and quality pickers, because those usually require fiddling with pop-ups and sub-menus, and they become more accessible here. However, I wish Google made these customizable. I\u2019d take a captions button over the stable volume toggle, while others may replace the like button with a sleep timer, for example.\nThere\u2019s still work to be done here, and I feel like Premium Controls have the potential to become something like Google Meet\u2019s On-The-Go or Spotify\u2019s Car Mode: large and easy-to-hit essential buttons that work well when you\u2019re busy doing something else. Until they\u2019re perfected, maybe it\u2019s a good thing that Premium Controls aren\u2019t available for everyone.\nSmart downloads are sanity savers\nI must\u2019ve missed the memo when YouTube made downloads a paid feature. I still remember when the option first launched and was available to everyone, free and paid users alike. At the time, I didn\u2019t have my YouTube Premium membership yet, and I was living in Lebanon, so I made a lot of use of downloads in spotty reception areas. I recall music video downloads not being possible for free users, but that seemed logical because it could replace Spotify, essentially.\nIf I'm stuck underground in a faulty subway, YouTube makes sure I have videos to watch offline.\nApparently, YouTube took this perk away from non-paying users a couple of years later and made it a Premium-only benefit. I was living in my posh Premium world by then, so I didn\u2019t notice the change. What I think is sad, though, is that this also includes smart downloads, or YouTube\u2019s tireless background work to keep a few videos available offline so you can watch anywhere, anytime.\nSmart downloads have rescued me a few times from deadly boredom when I\u2019d been lazy and forgotten to download things to watch on a flight. They also kept me entertained that one time I was stuck in an underground subway for an hour with a very spotty signal. Having those videos ready, even if I hadn\u2019t curated them myself, saved my sanity. I wish Google would offer smart downloads for free users, too, because it\u2019s a very casual viewing experience that can come in handy, all without giving you control to download and watch exactly what you want. The fact that it\u2019s not completely on-demand should justify making it accessible to everyone.\nCo-watching a video on a Google Meet call\nI\u2019d been hearing about the watch-together concept on Apple FaceTime, Plex, Jellyfin, and other apps and services, but not on Google Meet. It turns out Google already offers this, and you can start a watch-together session from your Meet call or start a Meet call while watching a YouTube video, easy peasy. I briefly tested it with my husband and we thought it was genius, so we plan on using this whenever one of us is away on a work trip.\nIt\u2019s another odd perk to tie to Premium-only subscriptions, though, especially when Apple is offering it in FaceTime for everyone. I\u2019ll file this also under the Google should offer it for free, but also publicize it more, and make it more accessible across messaging platforms like Google Messages and WhatsApp.\nThis sums up the odd and unexpected Premium-only perks complementing YouTube\u2019s ad-free and background play experience. Three of these \u2014 Continue Watching, queues in the mobile app, and smart downloads \u2014 are features I use every day, and personally, I\u2019d pay for those more than background play or picture-in-picture. All things said, this deep dive has given me a bigger appreciation for my Premium membership; now, I know I\u2019m getting more for my money than just ad removal.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nMicrosoft found a way to let you play YouTube in the background on Android, without Premium\nSeptember 1, 2025\n- Microsoft is testing a new feature on its Edge browser for Android that lets you play videos in the background.\n- The feature can be enabled through the Edge flags page. It works on YouTube, so you can play YouTube videos in the background.\n- Edge Canary for Android also offers a built-in ad blocker that works on YouTube.\nOne of the main benefits of subscribing to the $14 YouTube Premium plan is that it allows you to play videos in the background. But you might soon be able to enjoy this premium benefit for free if you use the Microsoft Edge browser.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nX user Leopeva64 discovered a new flag in Microsoft Edge Canary for Android that allows you to enable background video playback. This feature allows you to play videos from YouTube and other sites in the background.\nTo try it out, follow these steps: First, download Microsoft Edge Canary on your Android device, type edge://flags in the search field, and press Enter. Then, search for Video Background Play and choose Enabled from its status drop-down menu. After that, restart the browser.\nNext, head back to the Microsoft Edge homepage, tap the hamburger icon at the bottom-right corner, and choose Settings. Then, select Site settings > Background video playback and enable the Background video playback toggle.\nNow, YouTube videos will continue to play in the background even if you don\u2019t have a YouTube Premium subscription. The videos won\u2019t pause when you switch tabs in Edge, switch apps, or even lock your device. As mentioned, this also works across other websites.\nEdge Canary also shows a pop-up on its first launch that reads, \u201cTurn on Ad blocker to watch videos without interrupting ads.\u201d Choosing Turn On from this pop-up enables an ad blocker in Edge, so you won\u2019t see ads on most websites, including YouTube.\nIf and when both these features eventually become available in the Edge stable build, there will be more reasons to use the Edge browser and fewer reasons to subscribe to YouTube Premium, eventually hurting YouTube Premium subscriber numbers. In addition to Microsoft Edge, there are also apps like YouTube ReVanced that offer all the YouTube Premium perks for free.\nInterestingly, a similar thing happened in 2013 when Microsoft released its own YouTube app for Windows Phone. The app did not show ads on videos and also allowed users to download videos. All these violated YouTube\u2019s terms of service; as a result, Google blocked the Microsoft YouTube app for Windows Phone.\nOnly time will tell whether Google will again take strict action against Microsoft for allowing YouTube video playback in the background and offering ad blockers.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nYouTube Premium: Is it worth it? Pricing, content, and more\nMarch 21, 2025\nIt has been half a decade since YouTube Premium launched. First known as YouTube Red, the service is now bundled with YouTube Music Premium and offers many perks for a better viewing and listening experience. However, although the service has matured over the years, YouTube Premium hasn\u2019t exploded in popularity. The relentless sign-up pop-ups certainly didn\u2019t help, but there are solid arguments in favor of subscribing. So, is YouTube Premium worth it? We detail the service\u2019s pros, cons, price, and features below.\nHow much is YouTube Premium?\nSurely, by now, you\u2019ve seen the pop-ups for a free month trial of YouTube Premium, but how much does it cost once the trial is up? You\u2019ll find different prices worldwide \u2014 it may be cheaper in another country entirely. Here\u2019s how much each YouTube Premium plan costs in the US:\n| Individual | Individual (annual) | Family | Student | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | Individual $13.99/month | Individual (annual) $139.99/year | Family $22.99/month | Student $7.99/month |\nTotal users | Individual 1 | Individual (annual) 1 | Family 5 | Student 1 |\nAutorenewal | Individual Yes | Individual (annual) No | Family Yes | Student Yes |\nTrial length | Individual 1 month for new members | Individual (annual) No | Family 1 month for new members | Student 1 month for new members |\nNotes | Individual | Individual (annual) - Prepaid plan | Family - Members required to reside at the same address | Student - Student identification required - Limited to select countries - Maximum of four years |\nYouTube Premium\u2019s three tiers saw a slight price increase in 2023 but haven\u2019t changed since then in the US. The individual plan costs $13.99/month. There\u2019s also a more expensive family plan at $22.99/month. A student plan is available at $7.99/month but requires some student verification. The family plan, which hasn\u2019t seen a price jump, supports up to five family members in the same household. This is the best value option for those with kids or larger families. Since 2022, YouTube has offered an annual plan that costs $139.99/year for individuals.\nA number of countries around the world just saw a YouTube Premium price hike in September 2024. While that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a price increase in the US will follow in the coming months, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it did.\nFeatures\nSo, what comes with YouTube Premium? Below is everything you can expect with your subscription:\n- Ad-free videos: no annoying ad breaks on any content on any device logged into your Premium account.\n- Background play: you can listen to long videos, podcasts, and music with your screen locked.\n- Offline playback: you can download videos for later offline viewing.\n- YouTube Music Premium: ad-free access to the dedicated music app and its catalog of millions of songs.\n- YouTube Originals: ad-free Originals and access to exclusive premium content.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that although YouTube Originals used to be exclusive for Premium subscribers, many are now available for everyone. Granted, the only way to watch them ad-free is with YouTube Premium.\nIs YouTube Premium worth it?\nThe answer is no if you are looking for a Netflix or Hulu substitute. However, if you want a more than decent music streaming service and a better viewing experience on YouTube, you can\u2019t go wrong with YouTube Premium. It not only makes videos more enjoyable for you as a viewer, but it also supports your favorite creators.\nWith YouTube officially blocking ad blockers to view YouTube ad-free, paying the subscription fee remains the only official way to watch your favorite creators without interruption.\nSo, if you haven\u2019t tried it yet, the next time you see the annoying prompt, don\u2019t ignore it and test the service yourself. You might find that you like it.\nWhat we like about YouTube Premium\nIf you regularly watch content on YouTube, most of the paid-tier perks are as good as they sound.\nIt is hard to understate how great the ad-free experience is until you\u2019ve tried it. Many of us use ad blockers on our PCs, but advertisements are much harder to escape on mobile. And frankly, they pay for the content you watch, so it\u2019s nice to find a way to skip them without harming creators. With the implementation of double pre-roll and unskippable ads, YouTube Premium\u2019s ad-free experience is a necessity for anyone who spends a significant amount of time on the platform. Watching your favorite creators on the big screen of your TV when casting or using the smart TV app is also a lot more pleasant without constant interruptions.\nSpeaking of creators, however, YouTube Premium has another great advantage that is not mentioned enough: revenue sharing. A Premium subscription supports the YouTubers you love because YouTube shares a portion of the revenue for every view they receive from subscribers. This supposedly includes demonetized videos, too.\nThe good stuff doesn\u2019t end there, however. The access to Premium YouTube Music included in your subscription is underrated. The service has a huge catalog of songs. I was personally able to find every obscure song I could think of. Even if some weren\u2019t available as song files, I could still listen to the music videos with my screen locked.\nThe variety of genres and artists would please even the snobbiest music fans. For them, a subscription could be worth it for the tunes alone. It only costs $2 more per month than Spotify Premium, with additional perks to boot.\nWhat needs to improve\nWhen YouTube Red first launched, all the marketing seemed focused on original content. All of your favorite YouTubers but with bigger budgets \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t want that? Unfortunately, YouTube still hasn\u2019t delivered in this area. Nowadays, most originals are not exclusive to Premium subscribers. You can watch them with ads on a free account, but the quality seems to be deteriorating. The platform also looks to be pushing YouTubers aside in favor of celebrities.\nThis is unfortunate because YouTube seems to be squandering the potential of its existing creators. We have already seen how well some could do with bigger budgets. Mind Field, a documentary series by Michael from Vsauce, is the perfect example. Vsauce was already well-known for its fascinating scientific content, and Mind Field allowed Michael to dive deeper into issues by conducting experiments, interviewing experts, and more. It made for an intriguing and entertaining series.\nToday, YouTube could easily repeat its success by collaborating with channels such as Kurzgesagt, Crash Course, or even someone like the Angry Video Game Nerd. Instead, we have series like Celebrity Substitute and Create Together With Me with Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\nEven if you don\u2019t mind the celebrity videos, Originals are sometimes easy to miss. Although I have been subscribed to Premium for a few months, I rarely get recommendations for Originals, and few, if any, have popped up on my home page. That\u2019s a shame because some hidden gems like The Boy Band Con documentary are highly recommended. The Originals tab isn\u2019t designed well either, making it hard to discover new things to watch.\nFinally, the other major qualm some users might have with YouTube Premium is its price. Suppose you are not taking advantage of YouTube Music Premium. In that case, it\u2019s hard to justify spending $13.99/month for an ad-free experience and some original content, especially after spending a decade or more watching most of it for free.\nYouTube Premium problems and solutions\nIf you\u2019re a subscriber and still encounter ads, there\u2019s likely a good reason for it. Our guide for removing ads from YouTube Premium goes into deeper detail, but as a quick guide, find some of the potential fixes below.\n- Check if you\u2019re using YouTube in an incognito window.\n- You\u2019ll also want to enable YouTube cookies in your browser, and this is how YouTube will identify your membership.\n- Finally, double-check that you\u2019re signed in to YouTube. This is particularly important if you use a Google Chrome alternative, like Firefox or Safari.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nYouTube and ad blockers: Who's in the right?\nMay 30, 2024\nThe latest installment of the YouTube against ad blockers saga has brought a new twist. Some users have noticed that accessing YouTube with certain ad blockers enabled causes their videos to be skipped or muted, making the streaming service all but unusable. The natural response of some is to claim that this is another attempt by YouTube\u2019s owner, Google, to punish the use of these third-party apps and force them to either watch ads or pay for YouTube Premium instead. What\u2019s different this time is that Google isn\u2019t accepting the blame, so who should you believe?\nFollowing our reporting on this issue after it was flagged by Reddit users, YouTube responded to our request for a statement on the matter. The spokesperson made clear that ad blockers were against the YouTube Terms of Service but went on to reference \u201can unrelated push to improve YouTube\u2019s performance and reliability\u201d as a reason why users might be experiencing issues. On its face, this is a denial from Google and YouTube that the problem is related to the measures against ad blockers.\nWe wondered if this is a credible claim. The question isn\u2019t whether Google is targeting ad blockers but whether it is being entirely open about the extent of its tactics. Let\u2019s look at both sides of the argument.\nWhat\u2019s the evidence that Google is doing this?\nReddit user SDHD4K shared a demonstration of what they suspected to be Google\u2019s most recent ad blocker punishment. The video depicts the user attempting to play a video, both by clicking on a fixed point in the progress bar and by refreshing the page to start it from scratch. On each occasion, the video quickly jumps to the end.\nThe user claims that this is because they are using an ad blocker, and corroborating accounts of the issue are outlined in the replies to the post. Other people in the thread claim that accessing YouTube with an ad blocker causes the video to be automatically muted. If they use the volume slider to bring back the sound, it immediately mutes again once they move the cursor off the slider.\nSince this problem only seems to afflict those using ad blockers, the natural suspicion would be that it is one of Google\u2019s latest tactics to prevent the practice. The company doesn\u2019t hide the fact that it wants to do so in general. It began tests of a three-strike system against the use of ad blockers as far back as June 2023, with the crackdown appearing to become much more widespread by October. Many YouTube users with an ad blocker enabled started to see a message warning that playback would be blocked after three videos if the user didn\u2019t disable their ad blocker.\nA more recent escalation from April of this year saw mobile users with ad blockers also targeted. Google announced in an official blog post that, \u201cWhen we find an app that violates these terms, we will take appropriate action to protect our platform, creators, and viewers.\u201d While some users came across an error message stating that the content wasn\u2019t available, others faced buffering issues. These were attributed to the action that Google had advised it would take and had already been experienced by ad blocker users prior to the statement.\nWhat was interesting about this stage of the Google fightback was that, if it was deliberately causing buffering issues to people using ad blockers, that bears key similarities to this latest accusation. Rather than an explicit warning or denial of service, these measures seek to seriously hamper the YouTube experience until the ad blocker is disabled.\nDid Google deny it was behind the latest issue?\nWhile we\u2019re going down this rabbit hole, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at Google\u2019s statement to Android Authority when asked for comment about this skipping and muting problem.\nAd blockers violate YouTube\u2019s Terms of Service, and we\u2019ve been urging users for some time to support their favorite creators and allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium for an ad-free experience. An unrelated push to improve YouTube\u2019s performance and reliability may be resulting in suboptimal viewing experiences for ad blocker users.\nThe statement begins by reasserting that YouTube doesn\u2019t want you to use an ad blocker \u2014 this certainly isn\u2019t in dispute. But the last part suggests that a performance update, \u201cmay be resulting in suboptimal viewing experiences for ad blocker users.\u201d The inference here is that this \u2018push\u2019 might be responsible for this particular skipping and muting issue, but a skeptic might also conclude that this is deliberately vague. It could just as easily be a reference to the aforementioned buffering issues that have been occurring for months. That would certainly be more akin to a suboptimal viewing experience, which is something of an understatement if you\u2019re talking about videos that skip to the end immediately.\nAnother striking thing is that whatever this performance and reliability push might be, it seems rather coincidental that it has only caused issues for people using ad blockers. Perhaps the update actually relates to the measures being taken against ad blockers. But in that case, why make it sound as if it\u2019s a temporary inconvenience rather than confirming it was intended for that purpose?\nIn other words, there doesn\u2019t appear to be an equivocal denial that these recent issues are a deliberate attempt to target ad blockers. Or perhaps we\u2019re reading too much into it.\nWhat\u2019s the case for Google\u2019s defense?\nFar be it from me to stick up for a mega-corporation, but it\u2019s only fair to consider that Google might be genuine in its suggestion that this latest problem isn\u2019t a deliberate ploy.\nAs we\u2019ve already seen, Google doesn\u2019t hide the fact that it both discourages the use of ad blockers and is taking steps to prevent their use. The policy has been made clear in various statements over the past year, and when YouTube prevents you from using an ad blocker, the company tends to own it. When there were reports in November that the performance of YouTube with an ad blocker enabled can suffer depending on which browser you were using, a YouTube spokesperson gave us a statement not dissimilar to the one above. But, on that occasion, the statement made clear that it was the use of the ad blocker that was the issue and it was because YouTube wanted to discourage it.\nWe\u2019ve also seen a similar situation in which Google has been vindicated in the past. When some YouTube users with ad blockers enabled were slowed down in January, many people were suspicious of Google. The company denied it was responsible and suggested it was the ad blocker software at fault. That might have been taken with a pinch of salt, but a subsequent statement from the technology group that owned the two ad blockers in question confirmed Google\u2019s assertions and issued fixes to the problems.\nGoogle has been vindicated in the past.\nThat example could also shed light on the nature of this problem. Muting issues aside, the fact that the user gets skipped to the end of the video is a very specific \u2018error\u2019 to occur. You might wonder if this is the ad blocker confusing the video with one of the ads and trying to jump past it.\nThis debate is also based on a few anecdotal examples from Reddit. We don\u2019t know if many other people are affected by this issue, but we do know how internet virality works \u2014 an accusation of corporate oppression is made, outrage is generated, and everyone starts dunking on the service that we all regularly use.\nThe allegation itself raises further questions. If this is a deliberate Google scheme, why aren\u2019t we seeing widespread reports of it? Since this problem is only related to users of the Adblock Plus app, why wouldn\u2019t it apply to other ad blockers? Google is rarely accused of not being at the cutting edge of tech, so wouldn\u2019t YouTube be better at applying this to more ad-blocking apps?\nOn that point, you have to consider why Google would confuse your experience at all. It has no qualms about displaying the ad blocker warning message to some users. Why not just make that the default measure to encourage you to disable your ad blocker? Some users wouldn\u2019t realize that a performance issue is down to the fact their ad blocker is enabled, and it would be in Google\u2019s interests to tell you how you can remedy that situation.\nWhere does that leave us?\nYou may have your own ideas, but there isn\u2019t enough here for us to draw a definitive conclusion one way or the other.\nAs much as we might be frustrated by the number or length of ads before or during YouTube videos, Google has every right to attempt to stop you from blocking them. Most of its revenue is derived from ads, so blocking them is bad for business. You might not be keen on helping Google out this way, but some of that money does trickle down to the creator of the video that you\u2019re trying to watch for free. There is also an alternative in YouTube Premium if you\u2019d rather pay for your entertainment with your money rather than your time.\nYou might begrudgingly agree with all that but suggest that Google is being deceptive by appearing to deny it is causing this most recent issue. It would obviously be preferable for the company to be more open about it in those circumstances. Users would grumble about it, but at least they\u2019d know where they stand.\nExcept we can\u2019t really conclude that is the case. As outlined above, people have been a little too quick to point the finger of blame in the past, including us. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to give Google the benefit of the doubt on this one or not.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
