  "content": "Dr. Paul Offit, a frequent critic of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been blocked from participating in a panel of independent experts who advise the US Food and Drug Administration on vaccines.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told CNN that Offit was among multiple advisers to FDA committees whose terms have expired, meaning they can\u2019t participate in advisory committee work. Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN that a senior FDA official had previously asked him to extend his term on the FDA panel, but the paperwork appeared to have been held up at HHS.\n\nOffit, who is also a professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at CHOP, a former member of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s vaccine advisers and an inventor of the rotavirus vaccine RotaTeq, has clashed with Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine advocate, for years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been critical of RFK Jr. \u2014 I think for good reason,\u201d Offit told CNN on Tuesday. But he noted that he hadn\u2019t been given a reason for the holdup on the paperwork and pointed out, \u201cI\u2019ve been a vocal critic of him for many years,\u201d including during Kennedy\u2019s time helming the anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense, \u201cwhich was almost 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nA Trump administration hiring freeze applies to Special Government Employees, a category that includes advisers such as Offit, and renewals must go through the White House\u2019s Presidential Personnel Office, a person familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nNonetheless, Offit\u2019s inability to participate in the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory panel makes him just the latest in a slew of experts to depart or be ousted from the FDA and CDC under Kennedy. Most recent was the forcing out last week of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, an appointee of President Donald Trump who\u2019d been confirmed only weeks earlier, prompting the departure of multiple other key CDC leaders.\n\nOffit joined the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee in 2017, and he was a prominent voice helping interpret vaccine science throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHis latest term was set to end in January 2025, he said, before a senior FDA official asked him to remain for another four years.\n\nOffit agreed to stay until 2027, he said, and filled out renewed Special Government Employee forms, which include financial disclosures. But he says a senior official told him that those forms were \u201cheld up\u201d for months within HHS, and he finally received an email last week that said he was no longer a member of the FDA committee because his forms were never approved.\n\nKennedy has accused Offit of having conflicts of interest, a common theme in his targeting of government vaccine advisers; in June, Kennedy cited such conflicts when dismissing the 17 members of the CDC\u2019s advisory panel. Offit noted at the time that candidates for that committee were typically subjected to months of review, including for potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe HHS secretary also singled out Offit in an interview with Fox News in June, saying he had voted to add the rotavirus vaccine to the CDC\u2019s recommended immunization schedule and then sold his stake for $186 million. But Offit noted in a video he posted on social media that the vaccine hadn\u2019t come up for a vote until three years after he served as a voting member of the CDC advisory panel and that CHOP had owned the vaccine patent, not him.\n\n\u201cI worked for 26 years on that vaccine,\u201d he told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cBoth the motivation for doing it and the reward from doing it were never financial, obviously. What upsets me the most about that is that people believe it. You know, they believe that I would actually knowingly lie about vaccine safety or vaccine efficacy to line my own pocket.\u201d\n\nOffit said he\u2019s received hate mail, been physically assaulted and received death threats. \u201cThey hate you because they think that you\u2019re putting their children in harm\u2019s way for money. And it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nOffit emphasized that if the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, remains in its current form, just without him, he\u2019d still trust its advice.\n\n\u201cI love talking to my fellow committee members, because they\u2019re really smart, and I learned a lot. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll miss,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut the VRBPAC is in no sense weaker by my not being there. There are a lot of really good people on that committee, so I don\u2019t think anybody should feel they\u2019re getting lesser advice because I\u2019m not there.\u201d",

      "text": "Just two days after retiring the entirety of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed several prominent critics of the government\u2019s Covid-19 response to that committee.\nHe announced eight new members of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, on Wednesday.\nKennedy had said Monday that the previous 17-member panel that makes recommendations on who should get vaccines and when was rife with conflicts of interest and that he would appoint new \u201chighly credentialed\u201d experts in time for the panel\u2019s June 25 meeting, at which the members are expected to discuss guidance for Covid-19 and HPV shots, among others.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Kennedy said the reassembled panel will demand \u201cdefinitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations\u201d but will review data for the current vaccine schedule, as well.\nThe eight new ACIP members include Dr. Robert Malone, a biochemist who made early innovations in the field of messenger RNA but in more recent years has been a vocal critic of mRNA technology in Covid-19 vaccines.\nThe CDC recently narrowed its recommendations for mRNA Covid-19 shots, but some advocates in the Make America Healthy Again movement have pressed Kennedy to go further and bar the vaccines entirely.\nAnother new member is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who co-authored an October 2020 strategy on herd immunity known as the Great Barrington Declaration with Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, now director of the US National Institutes of Health.\nBoth Malone\u2019s and Kulldorff\u2019s names were circulated early in the second Trump administration as potential advisers on ACIP or other panels, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak with CNN.\nKennedy also chose Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician he described as a \u201cstrong advocate for evidence-based medicine\u201d who has served on hospital committees and medical executive boards.\nDr. Retsef Levi, an MIT professor who has published studies on mRNA vaccines and cardiovascular events, is also joining the panel. Levi is a professor of operations management.\nSeveral of the new members have served in federal health agencies previously, including Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a former acting chief of the NIH\u2019s section on nutritional neurosciences.\nDr. Cody Meissner, a Dartmouth professor of pediatrics who also signed the Great Barrington Declaration, has previously served on ACIP and on the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\nDr. Vicky Pebsworth, the Pacific region director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, also served on the FDA vaccine committee. Pebsworth has questioned vaccine safety, citing her son\u2019s \u201cserious, long-term health problems\u201d after vaccinations at 15 months, and served on the board of the nonprofit National Vaccine Information Center, which has suggested links between vaccines and autism.\nDr. Michael Ross, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, has previously served on the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Breast and Cervical Cancer. Kennedy also nodded in his statement to Ross\u2019 \u201ccontinued service on biotech and healthcare boards.\u201d\nThe private equity company Havencrest, in which Ross is an operating partner, describes him on its site as a \u201cserial CEO\u201d who has served on the boards of several biotechnology companies.\nRebuilding ACIP\nACIP, established in 1964, plays a quiet but significant role in American vaccine policy. The panel is typically an assembly of pediatricians, immunologists, researchers and patient advocates, and it is tasked with reviewing vaccine safety and efficacy and voting on who should receive which vaccines. Its recommendations shape insurers\u2019 coverage of vaccines and physicians\u2019 recommendations to their patients.\nKennedy has promised that a \u201cclean sweep\u201d of federal vaccine advisers will restore public trust in the medical establishment and in vaccines.\nHe argued in several public comments this week that the panel was rife with conflicts of interest and has served as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for vaccine manufacturers for years. ACIP members have historically stated disclosures and conflicts of interest at the start of meetings and make federal filings about stock holdings and research funding. ACIP also recently published members\u2019 conflicts and disclosures from 2000 through 2024 online.\nThe secretary has also said that several previous ACIP members \u201cwere last-minute appointees of the Biden administration\u201d and that without dismissing the panel, the Trump administration would not be able to add new members until 2028.\nBiden officials appointed eight members to ACIP in the final months of his administration. Panelists typically serve for four years.\nKennedy wrote on X Tuesday that none of the new ACIP members would be \u201cideological anti-vaxxers.\u201d\n\u201cThey will be highly credentialed physicians and scientists who will make extremely consequential public health determinations by applying evidence-based decision-making with objectivity and common sense,\u201d he said.\nAlthough the secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to remove and appoint new members to advisory boards, Kennedy\u2019s complete overhaul and speedy appointment of new members earned swift rebukes from physicians, nurses and some former health officials.\nThe American Medical Association, which is meeting in Chicago this week, adopted a resolution calling for Kennedy to reverse the decision to remove the previous ACIP members, particularly in the current climate around public health in the U.S.\n\u201cWith an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses,\u201d AMA President Dr. Bruce Scott said in a statement.\nVetting the new panel\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a giant step backwards,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and an outside adviser on vaccines to the US Food and Drug Administration. \u201cWe had on that committee, before the purge, the kind of expertise and experience and institutional memory from which we benefited. We don\u2019t have that anymore.\n\u201cYou have two anti-vaccine activists in that group,\u201d Offit said. \u201cRobert Malone, who testified in front of Congress that mRNA vaccines cause cancer, and you have Vicky Pebsworth, who is a member of the anti-vaccine group the National Vaccine Information Center.\u201d\nA suggestion that the new advisory committee will review the existing immunization schedule \u201ccould mean that everything\u2019s in play,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery vaccine that\u2019s on the current schedule is in play. Who knows what they could do? They could say, \u2018I think that these other vaccines need to be tested in the right way, because they haven\u2019t been tested in the right way before, and we\u2019re going to suspend their use until they\u2019re tested the right way.\u2019 The sky\u2019s the limit. It\u2019s chaos. One can only imagine how bad it could be.\u201d\nOffit was previously a member of ACIP and said the review of a new candidate before their appointment, including their conflicts of interest, typically takes at least two to three months.\n\u201cYou have to fill out a lot of forms, and people look very carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, to see whether you have the expertise; two, to see whether or not there\u2019s any undue connections, that you are completely independent of the pharmaceutical industry and completely independent of the government.\nTwo just-dismissed ACIP members noted that their application and review processes took much longer: from a year and a half to more than two years, although one pointed out that it\u2019s possible the process could be faster if an HHS secretary were in a hurry.\nWall Street reacts\nThe investment community following biopharma stocks also reacted with unease to the new slate.\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned by the appointments of vaccine critics like Drs. Malone and Kulldorf, and Vicky Pebsworth,\u201d said Evan Seigerman, an analyst with the financial firm BMO Capital Markets, noting that Malone \u201chas contributed to Covid-19 conspiracies and vaccine critique,\u201d Kulldorf \u201cwas against Covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates\u201d and Pebsworth\u2019s National Vaccine Information Center has been \u201cwidely criticized for spreading vaccine misinformation.\u201d\nSeigerman added, though, that \u201cwhile the appointment of known vaccine dissidents is alarming, such voices do not appear to dominate the committee.\u201d\nHe pointed out that the biggest fallout from the committee changes could be to insurance coverage of vaccines, noting that \u201cACIP\u2019s role in determining the annual US vaccine schedule is typically what then drives US insurer coverage decisions.\u201d"

If you have any questions regarding ethics training for SGEs, please contact Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff (ACOMS) by email at ACOMSsubmissions@FDA.HHS.gov.\nThe Principles of Ethical Conduct were established by Executive Order 12674, modified by Executive Order 12731, as basic principles regarding the conduct of federal employees. It is important that federal employees observe these principles in order to promote confidence in the integrity of the federal government.\nStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\nThe Standards were developed by the Office of Government Ethics and set forth the basic obligation of public service. The standards contain regulations regarding matters such as conflicting financial interests, impartiality in performing official duties, and misuse of position.\nHHS Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct\nOn February 3, 2005, The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) amended the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct (5 CFR 5501) and Supplemental Financial Disclosure Requirements section\n(5 CFR 5502), both effective on that date. On August 31, 2005, HHS published the Final Rule for both sections.\nUnited States Code, Title 18 contains the criminal conflict of interest statutes applicable to employees in the executive branch of the government. Included in Title 18 is a prohibition against solicitation or receipt of bribes; a prohibition against acting as an agent or attorney before the government; post-employment restrictions; a prohibition against participating in matters affecting personal financial interest; and a prohibition against receiving supplementation of salary as compensation for government service.\nAdditional Resources\n-\n\u201cEthics Rules for Advisory Committee Members and Other Individuals Appointed as Special Government Employees (SGEs)\u201d an 11-page summary prepared by the HHS OGC Ethics Division\n-\n\u201cOverview of the Ethics Rules for Special Government Employees Serving on Advisory Committees,\u201d a brochure prepared by the HHS OGC Ethics Division.\n-\n\u201cTo Serve with Honor,\u201d a 16-page booklet for advisory committee members prepared by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) in 2008.\n-\n\u201cThe Ethical Choice: Ethics for Special Government Employees\u201d at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDnYTRATCrs.\nRelevant Forms\n-\nOGE-450 Confidential Financial Disclosure Report\n-\nFDA-3410 Confidential Financial Disclosure Report for Special Government Employees\n-\nHHS-697 Foreign Activities Questionnaire\nFor all other Advisory Committee or SGE related questions, please visit the Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff (ACOMS) website https://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/default.htm or contact ACOMS by phone at (301) 796-8220 or email at ACOMSsubmissions@FDA.HHS.gov."

  "argos_summary": "Dr. Paul Offit, a prominent vaccine scientist and critic of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was barred from serving on the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee after his term expired and paperwork was reportedly held up by HHS. The move follows Kennedy\u2019s broader purge of CDC and FDA vaccine advisers amid accusations of conflicts of interest and a push for stricter vaccine oversight. Offit\u2019s exclusion highlights tensions between public health experts and the current administration\u2019s vaccine policy direction.",
