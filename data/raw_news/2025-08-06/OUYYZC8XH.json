  "description": "Weapons originally had an entirely different cast",
  "content": "Weapons director Zach Cregger has revealed that he originally had a completely different cast in mind for the film, including man of the hour Pedro Pascal.\n\n\"I had a whole different cast for this movie,\" Cregger told Entertainment Weekly. \"And then we had the strike, and then Pedro Pascal's schedule threw us into turmoil. I had to recast the entire movie.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood actors' union, went on strike from July to November 2023, halting production across the industry for nearly four months.\n\n\"This is what happens, right?\" the director continued. \"The strikes delayed us, and then when you delay, people's schedules get conflicts, and then you're back at square one. I bear no ill will towards anybody. We just kept getting delayed and delayed. It's like a domino effect. So I had to start over again.\"\n\nAlong with Pascal, Cregger went on to confirm that the horror movie's original cast also included Brian Tyree Henry and Renate Reinsve. However, the stars of the movie ultimately ended up being Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, and Julia Garner.\n\nCregger's follow-up to 2022's surprise hit Barbarian follows the aftermath of a peculiar incident that shakes a community to its core, when all but one child in an elementary school class runs off in the middle of the night for reasons unknown. The movie is a hit with critics and currently has a perfect score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with our own Weapons review praising \"the movie\u2019s stellar ensemble cast and compelling mystery\" that \"keep you hooked to the bloody end.\"\n\nWeapons hits theaters on August 8 in the US and August 7 in the UK.

      "text": "The most exciting upcoming horror movies coming in 2025 and beyond\nFrom Weapons to Five Nights At Freddy's 2, here are all the new horror movies coming out in 2025!\nThe horror genre is known for two contradictory things: showcasing incendiary original storytelling and (no less beloved or successful) rinsing its enduring properties for all they\u2019re worth, and the most exciting upcoming horror movies still to grace our screens this year are no exception in either camp.\nFrom the original horror stable we\u2019re getting new Antipodean ghost story Went Up The Hill, the body horror shocker Together, Jordan Peele-produced sports horror Him, the scary-old-people movie from the guy behind The Purge franchise The Home, the enigmatically terrifying kid-centric Weapons from the director of Barbarian, the indie horror gem about a missing paranormal investigator Shelby Oaks, and whatever it is that Osgood Perkins has up his scary sleeves for us next with Keeper.\nThen, of course, we have the sequels, including The Black Phone 2 and Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s 2, both from horror powerhouse Blumhouse, and the franchise entries: The Strangers: Chapter 2, The Conjuring: Last Rites, Hell House LLC: Lineage and Predator: Badlands.\nPlus, there are plenty of reboots and reimaginings still to come, from the new I Know What You Did Last Summer to Chuck Russell\u2019s take on Witchboard, and unrated schlockfest The Toxic Avenger to Guillermo del Toro\u2019s adaptation of Frankenstein to a remake of Anaconda starring Paul Rudd and Jack Black.\nThat is a lot to get excited about in the upcoming horror movies headed to cinemas and streaming. Here\u2019s more\u2026\nBring Her Back\nRelease date: July 25, 2025 (UK)\nDanny and Michael Philippou, the directors of 2022\u2019s supernatural horror smash hit Talk To Me, have teamed up again with A24 for their sophomore feature, Bring Her Back, which stars The Shape of Water\u2019s Sally Hawkins and follows a brother and sister who uncover a terrifying ritual at the secluded home of their new foster mother. The teaser trailer, which has just dropped in February, promises more of the unsettling imagery scared up by the Philippous in Talk To Me, with what looks like some supernatural and even folk horror vibes. For horror fans who have been eagerly awaiting what fresh terror the Aussie filmmakers are ready to unleash next, May can\u2019t arrive quickly enough.\nGet sneak previews, exclusive competitions and details of special events each month!\nI Know What You Did Last Summer\nRelease date: July 18, 2025\nIn the midst of the '90s slasher boom, a little film called I Know What You Did Last Summer hit our screens, lighting them up like 4th July fireworks and solidifying Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., and Ryan Phillippe as teen horror icons. The movie follows four young friends who, bound by a tragic accident, are reunited when they\u2019re stalked by a hook-wielding maniac in their small seaside town.\nThe following year, its sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer brought Hewitt and Prinze Jr. back to continue their ordeal, pairing them up with Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer in the Bahamas. And now, 27 years later, they\u2019re returning with a fresh look at the franchise, directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson (Do Revenge, Someone Great). It would seem whoever \u2018knows\u2019 hasn\u2019t forgotten, as buried secrets once again resurface. Madelyn Cline (Glass Onion) and Billy Campbell (Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula) will also star.\nThe Home\nRelease date: July 25, 2025\nJames DeMonaco, the creator behind massive genre franchise The Purge, is back in the horror director\u2019s chair for the first time since 2016\u2019s The Purge: Election Year with more exciting original storytelling. The Home stars Pete Davidson (Bodies Bodies Bodies) as Max, who after being sentenced to community service working in a retirement home, realizes there\u2019s something terribly wrong and that the residents and caretakers hide sinister secrets. The trailer promises something for everyone: dread, gore, jump scares and some truly terrifying imagery. John Glover (Smallville, In The Mouth of Madness, Gremlins 2: The New Batch) and Ethan Phillips (Critters) also star.\nTogether\nRelease date: July 30, 2025 (US), August 15, 2025 (UK)\nWritten and directed by Michael Shanks in his feature debut, and starring IRL couple Alison Brie (GLOW, Horse Girl, The Rental) and Dave Franco (Nerve, Love Lies Bleeding), Together recently premiered as part of the Sundance Midnight selection at January\u2019s film festival. According to Variety, the film kept the packed audience hooting and hollering at many of its gory, surprising set pieces, and in an interview for IMDb, Franco described the film as \"very scary\".\nThe psychological sci-fi body horror follows a codependent couple's move to the countryside which triggers a supernatural incident that exacerbates their existing issues and drastically alters their relationship\u2026 and their physical form.\nWeapons\nRelease date: August 8, 2025\nFollowing his hugely popular break-out horror movie Barbarian in 2022, in which he subverted the home invasion subgenre and audience expectations in one fell \u2018WTF\u2019 swoop, director Zach Cregger is now back with his much anticipated sophomore feature. Described as a \u201chorror epic\u201d and with a stellar cast including Josh Brolin (Sicario, Planet Terror, No Country for Old Men), Julia Garner (Wolf Man, Apartment 7A) and Benedict Wong (Annihilation, the MCU), Weapons is a chilling mystery that tells interrelated stories about the disappearance of high school students in a small town. We cannot wait to see what Cregger has up his creepy sleeves with this one.\nWitchboard\nRelease date: August 15, 2025\nIn the late eighties, director Chuck Russell treated horror fans to two much-loved favourites: A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors in \u201887 and a brilliant remake of The Blob in \u201888, but then he moved away from the genre. Well he\u2019s finally back, with a reimagining of the 1986 cult classic Witchboard and, since Russell has stated \u201cI wanted to top my other two horror films\u201d, we are excited about it!\nStarring Madison Iseman (Annabelle Comes Home, I Know What You Did Last Summer series), Aaron Dominguez (Only Murders in the Building), Mel Jarnson (Mortal Kombat) and Charlie Tahan (The Pale Blue Eye, Ozark), Witchboard follows a group of friends who discover a mysterious artifact as they prepare to open a cafe in New Orleans. Cue darkness, obsession, summoned spirits, mysterious occult experts and a sumptuous masked ball, all under Chuck Russell\u2019s well-trained eye.\nWent Up The Hill\nRelease date: August 15, 2025\nAntipodean horror has a rich history and is currently having a bit of a moment, with the Philippou brothers\u2019 sophomore effort Bring Her Back and serial killer/shark movie Dangerous Animals already proving popular with audiences this year. Samuel Van Grinsven is a New Zealand-born writer and director based in Sydney and his new film is his first foray into horror following his 2019 breakout Sequin in a Blue Room. In Went Up The Hill, Dacre Montgomery (Stranger Things, Better Watch Out) plays Jack, a young man who ventures to a remote part of New Zealand for the funeral of his estranged mother and meets her widow Jill, played by the brilliant Vicky Krieps (Old, Phantom Thread). But his mother's spirit returns to inhabit each of their bodies, turning this into a bold new ghost story that we\u2019re very excited for.\nShelby Oaks\nRelease date: August 21, 2025\nThis indie horror movie written and directed by Chris Stuckmann in his feature debut was made with support from a campaign on Kickstarter and has recently welcomed Mike Flanagan as an executive producer. Shelby Oaks is shot as a traditional feature, but has some interesting elements of found footage, and follows Mia, a woman on a desperate search for Riley, her missing paranormal investigator sister.\n\"As Mia uncovers new and disturbing leads related to Riley\u2019s disappearance, she uncovers evidence of a hidden supernatural evil dating all the way back to [their] childhood.\" Camille Sullivan, who starred in 2020\u2019s exceptional horror/thriller Hunter Hunter plays Mia, and is joined by Brendan Sexton (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Session 9, Don\u2019t Breathe 2), Michael Beach (Insidious: Chapter 2, Saw X) and the legendary Keith David (The Thing, They Live, Nope).\nThe Toxic Avenger\nRelease date: August 29, 2025\nThe reboot of the 1984 Troma Entertainment comedy-horror cult classic got its world premier at Fantastic Fest in September 2023 and then disappeared into the distribution void but now, thanks to Cineverse having picked it up, we finally have a release date. Macon Blair, best known as the director of 2017\u2019s indy favourite I Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore and his acting turns in a whole host of genre fair including Blue Ruin, Green Room and The Hunt, feels like a safe pair of hands for this retelling of the tale of The Toxic Avenger \u2013 a mutated anti-hero who wields a deadly mop. Peter Dinklage is in the title role, alongside Kevin Bacon, Jacob Tremblay and Elijah Wood, and this should be one on the radar for anyone with a penchant for schlocky gore, quirky comedy and practical effects.\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites\nRelease date: September 5, 2025\nAnd now the end is near, and so we face the final Conjuring. For over a decade now, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have been battling the forces of supernatural evil as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, and now they\u2019re ready to hang up their holy water, big collars and guitars in the fourth and final installment, The Conjuring: Last Rites.\nJames Wan\u2019s Conjuring Universe is a box office juggernaut that has grossed around $2.2 billion over eight mixed but largely enjoyable movies to date, making it the most successful horror franchise ever and rehabilitating the controversial real-life Warrens as modern-day genre faves. Michael Chaves is back on directing duty for Last Rites after helming other franchise entries, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, The Nun II, and The Curse of La Llorona, and the new film will see Ed and Lorraine taking on one last terrifying case.\nThe Long Walk\nRelease date: September 12, 2025\nThere\u2019s a new Stephen King adaptation on the horizon and the straight-up talent involved in The Long Walk is hugely exciting. Directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine, I Am Legend, the Hunger Games movies), with a screenplay by JT Mollner (Strange Darling) and starring Mark Hamill (Star Wars, The Fall of the House of Usher), Judy Greer (Halloween, Halloween Kills) and Garrett Wareing (God is a Bullet), that\u2019s a lot of impressive names, especially when paired with one of King\u2019s most ambitious novels (written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman).\nThe dystopian horror revolves around a group of teenage boys who sign up for an annual contest known as The Long Walk, where they must maintain a certain walking speed or get shot. It shares some themes with The Hunger Games and Battle Royale, but the brutal, heart-stopping horror is mixed with that small town sepia Americana that King does so well. We can\u2019t wait.\nHim\nRelease date: September 19, 2025\nSports and horror might not be two themes that are often explored together in cinema, but the new movie from director Justin Tipping (Kicks) and Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw Productions (the studio behind Peele's Get Out, Us and Nope, and 2021's Candyman) is about to change all that. Him stars Tyriq Withers (Atlanta) as a promising young football player who joins an isolated compound to train under a dynasty team's aging quarterback, played by Marlon Wayans (Requiem for a Dream, Scary Movie). Alongside Withers and Wayans, the cast also includes Julia Fox (Uncut Gems, Presence) and Tim Heidecker (Us, Y2K).\nThe Strangers: Chapter 2\nRelease date: September 26, 2025\nThe second installment of Renny Harlin\u2019s The Strangers trilogy is headed to theaters this September, continuing the story from 2024\u2019s Chapter 1 in which Madelaine Petsch\u2019s Maya found herself at the mercy of the now-iconic masked psychopaths: The Man in Mask, Dollface and Pin-Up girl, first introduced in Bryan Bertino\u2019s original 2008 home invasion horror. The Strangers: Chapter 2 is clocking up a run-time of well over two and a half hours so, following the lukewarm critical response to last year\u2019s franchise entry, there should be plenty of room for the horror to stretch its legs and hopefully deliver some compelling storytelling and visceral scares to gear up to Chapter 3\u2019s forthcoming conclusion.\nKeeper\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nExciting news, Osgood Perkins fans! Not content with releasing one of the best and biggest horror films of 2024 with Longlegs, and then treating us hot on its heels to the highly entertaining gorefest that was The Monkey in February, the director is gearing up to deliver yet another descent into darkness before the year is out.\nTatiana Maslani and Tess Degenstein - who both worked with Perkins on The Monkey - will star alongside Rossif Sutherland (Orphan: First Kill, Possessor) in Keeper, set to hit cinemas in October. Sutherland and Maslani play a couple - Malcolm and Liz - who set out on a romantic anniversary retreat, but when Malcolm unexpectedly leaves for the city, Liz is left alone to be confronted by a sinister presence within their remote cabin. You keep making them Oz, and we\u2019ll keep watching them.\nThe Black Phone 2\nRelease date: October 17, 2024\nWe love a horror sequel that audiences are actually excited about and Scott Derrickson\u2019s follow-up to his 2021 supernatural/child abduction hit The Black Phone is shaping up to be one such movie. There\u2019s very little known about The Black Phone 2 currently, but it has been confirmed that original cast members Ethan Hawke, Jeremy Davies, Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw are all returning.\nThe first movie and its characters were based on a short story written by Joe son-of-Stephen-King Hill, and while he won\u2019t back for the sequel screenplay, Derrickson has teamed up again with C. Robert Cargill who also worked on The Black Phone and the Sinister films. Here\u2019s hoping for more fearful fun from this team that just seems to love the horror genre.\nHell House LLC: Lineage\nRelease date: November 1, 2025\nAre you ready to return to the haunt? The Hell House LLC franchise is coming back with its fifth \u2013 and possibly final \u2013 installment, further exploring the backstories of the series\u2019 characters and introducing some new ones to the mix. Unlike the four previous movies, starting with Hell House LLC in 2015, Lineage won\u2019t be a found footage horror and will present its terrors in more of a traditional cinematic narrative. But fans shouldn\u2019t worry \u2013 Elizabeth Vermilyea, Cayla Berejikian, Victoria Andrunik, Gideon Berger, Bridget Rose Perrotta, Destiny Brown and James Liddell all return, as does the franchise\u2019s genuinely terrifying clown. Hell House LLC: Lineage will hit Shudder just in time for Halloween.\nPredator: Badlands\nRelease date: November 7, 2025\nThe plot of Predator: Badlands, the upcoming new entry in the juggernaut franchise that has been pulling in audiences since 1987, is currently under wraps, but we do know a few details. Firstly, it\u2019s directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who is back with the franchise after he stunned in 2022 with his Comanche Nation-set Predator movie Prey, and secondly, it stars Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon, The Beguiled).\nHowever, it\u2019s perhaps the protagonist of the new movie that has had people most excited, after Trachtenberg revealed that it\u2019s the Predator itself that will be taking center stage. Filming has wrapped in New Zealand, whose dramatic landscapes will stand in for the alien planet where the story\u2019s action takes place.\nFrankenstein\nRelease date: November 2025\nThe long-awaited adaptation of Mary Shelley's seminal sci-fi horror story Frankenstein by celebrated genre director Guillermo del Toro (Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, The Devil\u2019s Backbone, Hellboy, Crimson Peak, The Shape of Water) now has a release month of November, when it will hit audiences' homes on Netflix. Del Toro\u2019s narrative (he\u2019s co-credited as writer with Shelley) revolves around Christoph Waltz\u2019s Dr. Pretorius who tracks down the iconic Monster (Jacob Elordi) \u2013 believed to have died in a fire decades before \u2013 in order to continue the experiments of Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac). The all-star cast also includes Mia Goth, Ralph Ineson and Charles Dance. Electrifying!\nFive Nights At Freddy's 2\nRelease date: December 5, 2025\nIn 2023, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s became Blumhouse\u2019s highest-grossing movie of all time, and the cast and crew behind the popular video game-based smash hit is coming back with its sequel at the end of 2025. The first film followed Josh Hutcherson\u2019s Mike, a troubled security guard who gets a job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza only to find himself battling killer animatronics.\nDirector Emma Tammi, her co-writers Scott Cawthon and Seth Cuddeback, and stars Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, and Piper Rubio are all returning for Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s 2, which, with the tagline \u2018Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances', and will no doubt take the classic follow-up approach of upping the stakes, the action, and - hopefully - the horror. This is also one of our most anticipated upcoming video game movies of 2025!\nAnaconda\nRelease date: December 25, 2025\nThere\u2019s a big new creature feature on the horizon and, while this might not have been on anyone\u2019s 2025 horror bingo card, it\u2019s a reboot of 1997\u2019s Anaconda being brought to us by Jack Black and Paul Rudd on Christmas Day. Although at first glance this might feel like an unusual project pairing, Black has some monster movie pedigree from Peter Jackson\u2019s King Kong and Rudd is no stranger to blockbuster action, having played Ant-Man across multiple installments of the MCU.\nFrom what we currently know from the synopsis, the new Anaconda movie could well be a meta affair, as a group of friends going through midlife crises decide to remake a favorite movie from their youth but encounter unexpected events (and, we assume, one very big snake) when they enter the jungle. Joining Black and Rudd on the cast are Steve Zahn (Joyride) and Thandiwe Newton (Westworld). Tom Gormican (The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent) will direct.\nThe Bride\nRelease date: March 6, 2026\nMore rebooted Universal Monster action is on its way, this time revolving around one of horror\u2019s most iconic female characters, and directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal \u2013 following her hugely successful feature debut The Lost Daughter in 2021 \u2013 who's adapting the stunning black and white classic from 1935, James Whale\u2019s Bride of Frankenstein. The new movie takes place in '30s Chicago, where Frankenstein asks Dr. Euphronius for help creating a companion, and when they bring a murdered woman back to life as the Bride (played by Men\u2019s Jessie Buckley), they spark romance, police interest, and radical social change.\nAlong with its significant heritage, an impressive ensemble cast including Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Life, Velvet Buzzsaw), Christian Bale (American Psycho, The Pale Blue Eye), Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky, Murder on the Orient Express), Peter Sarsgaard (The Skeleton Key, Orphan) and Annette Bening (Mars Attacks!) makes this another hugely anticipated horror for 2025.\nFor more, check out our guides to all the movie release dates this year and new TV shows.\nBecky Darke is a London-based podcaster and writer, with her sights on film, horror and 90s pop-culture.

Here's what happened. By Nick Romano Nick Romano Nick is an entertainment journalist based in New York, NY. If you like pugs and the occasional blurry photo of an action figure, follow him on Twitter @NickARomano. EW's editorial guidelines Updated on August 5, 2025 07:58PM EDT 1 Comment Pedro Pascal at the 'Gladiator II' London premiere; Josh Brolin in 'Weapons'. Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty; Quantrell Colbert/Warner Bros. Hollywood apparently loves to see Pedro Pascal play a father. Maybe it has something to do with his meme-powered \"zaddy\" renaissance. But there was a reality in which Pascal could've played a fourth dad figure in 2025 alone after The Last of Us season 2, Eddington, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps. Before Weapons writer/director Zach Cregger cast Josh Brolin to play Archer, the father of a missing kid, Pascal was set to play the part. That's just one way Cregger says his buzzed-about horror movie (in theaters Aug. 8) could've looked very different. \"I had a whole different cast for this movie,\" the filmmaker tells Entertainment Weekly. \"And then we had the strike, and then Pedro Pascal's schedule threw us into turmoil. I had to recast the entire movie.\" Cary Christopher as Alex in 'Weapons'. Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures. Cregger's Barbarian follow-up is the story of how 17 children from the same class at the fictional Maybrook Elementary School in Pennsylvania mysteriously woke up at 2:17 in the morning and quietly left their homes, never to return. From July 14 to Nov. 9, 2023, members of the Screen Actors Guild \u2014 American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) went on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which coincided with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike that ran from May 2 to Sep. 27 of the same year. The dueling events brought the industry to a standstill and had far-reaching ripple effects for a variety of projects, including Weapons. 'Weapons' opening scene tells the origin of the movie itself \u2014 Watch exclusive clip 'Weapons' first look: 'Barbarian' director makes his 'horror epic' (exclusive) Cregger confirms earlier reports about his cast originally including Pascal, Brian Tyree Henry (Causeway), Renate Reinsve (The Worst Person in the World), and Austin Abrams (Wolfs). Schedules no longer aligned post-strike, especially Pascal's, who had a number of high-profile projects filling his dance card. \"This is what happens, right?\" Cregger continues. \"The strikes delayed us, and then when you delay, people's schedules get conflicts, and then you're back at square one. I bear no ill will towards anybody. We just kept getting delayed and delayed. It's like a domino effect. So I had to start over again.\" Austin Abrams as James in 'Weapons'. Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures. Out of that initial four, only Abrams carried over to the final cast as James, a homeless man hooked on drugs. \"He hung tough with me. That's my dude right there,\" Cregger comments. \"I'd seen Barbarian with a friend. I remember when it cut to Justin Long in the car, I just knew I loved whoever made that movie,\" Abrams says. \"I was able to get in contact with Zach, and then it turned out he was making something. He thought I was a good fit for it, potentially.... I loved the part and I didn't wanna let it go. So I just really held on 'cause I really wanted to do it.\" Want more movie news?

While Abrams carried over and Brolin filled the Pascal void as Archer, Cregger went on to cast Alden Ehrenreich as Paul, a local police officer. Julia Garner as Ms. Justine Gandy, the elementary school teacher whose students disappeared, was one of the last roles he needed to cast. \"I Zoomed with Julia, and within like three minutes, I knew she was the one because she's so intelligent,\" Cregger recalls. \"Just the way she'd already read the script and the way she talked about the character, it was like, 'This is what I've been looking for.' I'd been looking for someone who could smell the essence of this and knew exactly how to come in. I think Julia's smarter than I am, so I knew it was gonna be in good hands with her.\" Close View comments Read more: Movies"

      "text": "Weapons director says the upcoming horror movie is \"fun, scary\" and even \"weirder than Barbarian\"\nBarbarian director says Weapons has a \"f***ed up\" story\nPrepare yourselves horror fans, because director Zach Cregger has promised that his upcoming movie Weapons is even wilder than Barbarian. If that is even possible.\n\"[It\u2019s] a fun movie. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s scary, it\u2019s inviting. It\u2019s not a grim, morose slog. And yet the story it tells is really fucked up.\" said Cregger to Empire, calling Weapons a \"creatively ambitious\" work, that\u2019s \"a lot bigger and weirder than Barbarian.\"\nNow that\u2019s quite the statement, as anyone who has seen Barbarian knows how twisted and downright weird the 2022 movie gets. Barbarian follows a young woman who books a rental home only to discover someone is already staying there. However, that isn\u2019t the strangest part, as upon spending the night at the Airbnb from hell, she finds that the house\u2019s vast basement is harboring a horrifying secret.\nDespite the success of Barbarian, Cregger\u2019s upcoming movie Weapons is a standalone film that follows an entirely different premise. Written and directed by Cregger, Weapons takes place in a town where all but one child from the same class mysteriously vanish on the same night at exactly the same time, 2:17am. Let\u2019s just hope The Mother isn't behind this one.\nWe can expect Weapons to be a little different from Barbarian in more ways than one, as the director says the upcoming movie stems from a completely separate stream of inspiration. \"Barbarian was an exploration of social themes; [it] was me looking at the world around me,\" said Cregger. \"This is more an exploration of my own personal shit, for lack of a better word. Weapons is me looking within, and working on myself.\"\nWeapons stars Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher, with Benedict Wong, and Amy Madigan.\nWeapons hits theaters on August 8.

I'm not really a horror fan, but when I read it, I just felt like this movie had so much to say about these human beings that was so beautifully crafted, and it was just so interesting,\" says Alden Ehrenreich to GamesRadar+. \"And then, like you said, no idea where it was gonna go.\" Star Julia Garner adds, \"That, just that.\"\nAfter making waves with his 2022 twisted horror Barbarian, Cregger is back with Weapons, which similarly gives absolutely nothing away in the first few scenes, then flips to something truly unexpected halfway through the movie. In our spoiler-free Weapons review, we call the movie \"a layered and multifaceted drama\u2026 that leaves you just as confused as the poor townsfolk of Maybrook.\" Even the use of clever marketing tactics gives absolutely nothing away.\nHowever, what sold Weapons to star Josh Brolin was the movie\u2019s unique pace and stellar writing. \"Really, I was pleased. I was pleased because reading a lot, you read things that aren't as great and well-designed and as emotional,\" adds Brolin. \"I don't get offered a lot of horror movies. I don't watch a lot of horror movies, if that's indeed what it is. But I just thought it was so well written, you know.\" Brolin says he then watched Barbarian and \"thought it was great.\"\nIn fact, Brolin\u2019s time in the Creggerverse was so \"positive\" that he wants to work with the director again. \"I think from here on out, you know, we'll see what Zach does. I have a tendency to work with directors more than once, so we'll see what the future holds.\"\nAlso starring Austin Abrams, Benedict Wong, and Amy Madigan, Weapons follows a small community left in shambles when all but one child from the same class mysteriously vanishes on the same night, at exactly the same time.\nWeapons releases in theaters on August 8 in the US and on August 7 in the UK.

      "text": "\"I probably shouldn't even say that\": Weapons director teases surprise cast members in his new horror movie, which has \"more twists and turns than Barbarian\"\nExclusive: Director Zach Cregger says his upcoming horror movie Weapons has \"seven main characters,\" with some of the cast yet to be revealed\nDirector Zach Cregger made a name for himself in 2022 when his shocking horror movie Barbarian hit screens. But it looks like the filmmaker may one-up himself this year, as he says his upcoming flick Weapons has even more surprises than Barbarian, with more cast members yet to be announced.\n\"I've got to be so careful about spoilers, but here's what I will say. This movie has more twists and turns than Barbarian, but what it doesn't do, very intentionally, is I never abandon the audience,\" Cregger says in the new issue of SFX magazine, which features Alien: Earth on the cover and hits newsstands on Wednesday, July 16.\nFrom its creepy marketing and chilling posters to the first cryptic trailer, Cregger and Warner Bros. are holding their cards pretty close to their chests when it comes to Weapons. It looks like this is for a good reason as the director tells SFX that the stellar cast, including Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, and Alden Ehrenreich, are not the only stars of the movie. Oh no, there are more characters yet to come.\n\"There's a couple of names that aren't in the cast announcement, and there's a couple of [actors] that I think people have not realised what a big deal their characters will be,\" says Cregger. \"That's great, and I probably shouldn't even say that, but there are some actors that... it's amazing what they do... There are seven main characters in this movie and the trailer, we're leaning into two of those. But there are truly seven main characters.\"\nThese elusive characters may have something to do with the fact that Cregger seems to be hiding the real premise of the movie. According to the movie\u2019s synopsis, Weapons takes place in a town where \"all but one child from the same class mysteriously vanish on the same night at exactly the same time,\" leaving the community \"questioning who or what is behind their disappearance.\"\nCregger suggests that there is a lot more to Weapons than meets the eye. \"The engine of the children leaving is the engine of the whole movie, but the mystery is not the engine of the whole movie,\" he clarifies, albeit somewhat cryptically. We know that Barbarian\u2019s trailers didn\u2019t show the Mother or mention anything about the climactic second act. It looks like that is the case for Weapons, too.\nThe film also stars Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher, Benedict Wong, and Amy Madigan.\nNot a subscriber to SFX?

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nZach Cregger has struck gold again with Weapons, a twisted fairytale that bests the director\u2019s horror debut, Barbarian. Hiding a positively terrifying villain, the movie\u2019s stellar ensemble cast and a compelling mystery keep you hooked to the bloody end.\nPros\n- +\nCameos and plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat.\n- +\nJulia Garner perfectly portrays a deeply flawed protagonist.\n- +\nAmy Madigan is unrecognizable in the best way.\nCons\n- -\nWould have liked to see more of Josh Brolin\u2019s character.\n- -\nSome scenes feel a little slow due to lengthy dialogue exchanges.\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nAfter making waves in the genre with his 2022 horror debut Barbarian, many feared that director Zach Cregger might be a one-hit wonder. Fanatics of the frightful wondered whether Cregger would ever top the surprise success of his twisty Airbnb-from-hell monster movie. But I\u2019m here to tell you, Barbarian was no fluke, as Cregger has one-upped himself with his latest movie, Weapons.\nIt may be down to the bigger budget, star power, and some of the best writing the genre has seen in some time, but Weapons is the best horror movie of the year. Featuring a stellar ensemble cast, including Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, and Amy Madigan, the movie takes place in a town where a classroom full of children mysteriously goes missing one night, leaving the whole community at a loss, questioning who or what is behind their disappearance.\nHowever, don\u2019t think you can guess what happens next. Weapons is a layered and multifaceted drama stuffed inside the skin of a horror movie that leaves you just as confused as the poor townsfolk of Maybrook, wondering what is going on for half the movie, and terrified for the rest.\nDark Delights\nKudos to Cregger for keeping Weapons\u2019 many surprises under wraps. It\u2019s a film that\u2019s much better to go into blind, particularly when it comes to Weapons\u2019 frightful villain. However, this sense of uncertainty lasts way into the movie too, as Cregger cleverly keeps the real root of the terror out of view well past the halfway point. Consider how shocked you were when you saw Nicholas Cage\u2019s serial killer in Longlegs for the first time, and multiply that by 10. Not only does Weapons succeed in veiling its villain just long enough to let the tension build, when the movie's monster of sorts is revealed, the terror doesn't dissipate.\nRelease date: August 8\nAvailable: In cinemas\nDirector: Zach Cregger\nRuntime: 128 minutes\nSpeaking of the villain, Cregger has really gone back to basics with Weapons\u2019 antagonist. At a time when many horror movies seem to be relying on shoddy CGI and over-the-top effects to bring monsters to life, Weapons\u2019 creepy figure seems to have been pulled right out of a Brothers Grimm fairytale, or rather, nightmare. Mixing cautionary tales such as Pied Piper and Hansel and Gretel, Weapons preys upon our very human fear of the unknown and the uncanny with its utterly beguiling evil entity.\nWeapons mimics a fairytale in more ways than one, not only in the root of the story, but how it creates the effect of a child hearing a scary story whilst staying up way too late at a sleepover. Watching Cregger\u2019s twisted masterpiece made me feel as though I was a little girl again, terrified of the goggle-eyed witch in Disney\u2019s Snow White. As a horror-loving 20-something-year-old, I didn't think any film would make me feel that way again; until now.\nMany hands make light work\nHowever, as brilliant as Weapons\u2019 antagonist may be, they must share the spotlight. Weapons has no one main character; in fact, it has several. Splitting the movie into diary entry-like episodes focusing on each character, much like Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, the horror story is told from multiple perspectives, connecting the threads as the movie goes on. This only adds to the suspense and allows the viewer to piece together the mystery at the same rate as the Maybrook community does.\nBy including a fractured relationship between Garner\u2019s deeply flawed elementary school teacher and Ehrenreich\u2019s incapable cop, Brolin\u2019s desperate father experiencing every parent's worst nightmare, Abrams\u2019 troubled drug addict, and more, Weapons builds a whole world. There\u2019s also some rather surprising cameos and a cheeky Barbairan Easter egg to keep you on your toes.\nIf there\u2019s one gripe with the packed cast, it\u2019s that sometimes it feels as though characters are fighting for screen time. Certain storylines, such as Garner and Ehrenreich\u2019s entanglement, tend to drag on, while Brolin feels underutilised.\nOverall, Cregger\u2019s twisted fairytale is not only the best horror movie to come out of an already impressive year for the genre, but Weapons is a positively terrifying, heartwrenching look at a struggling community. Wth cleverly placed jump scares, the Barbarian follow-up will unsettle the most macho of horror buffs. All that\u2019s left to ask is, what\u2019s next for the Creggerverse?\nWeapons releases in theaters on August 8 in the US and on August 7 in the UK.
