Generate Key Takeaways\n\nAdd fresh young talent, mix with veteran star Cathy Moriarty, season with comedy and some body horror and you have the recipe for Sunday Sauce, the new short from up-and-comer Matt Campanella.\n\nThe emerging cineaste not only directed, but wrote and stars in the film, which screens Saturday at the prestigious Oscar-qualifying HollyShorts festival in Los Angeles. The action takes place in the Morris Park section of New York City where a colorful family prepares for Sunday dinner \u2013 Grandmother Nancy (Moriarty), her son Gino (Matthew Risch), Gino\u2019s daughter Francesca (Nicole Ehinger) who is pregnant and unmarried, and a woman who sits in a chair, comatose. That would be Maria (Maria Carrozza), wife of Gino, daughter-in-law of Nancy, felled by an air conditioner 457 days previously.\n\u2022 None Alden Ehrenreich, Catherine Hardwicke, Tom Skerritt, Lexi Underwood To Be Honored At 20th HollyShorts Film Festival\n\nA lively dinner table is a place intimately familiar to Campanella as an Italian American.\n\n\u201cItalians, we have this very staccato way of talking over each other. It can be very volatile,\u201d Campanella tells Deadline. \u201cOne second, we\u2019re fighting over where the fork should be placed on the table, the next second we\u2019re hugging, crying, and nothing ever really phases us. At the end of the day, family is very strong and that bond, it\u2019s very unique in the Italian culture. So, I kind of just built from that.\u201d\n\nAs Gino prepares his signature Lobster Fra Diavolo and Francesca chops cucumbers for a salad \u2013 under the watchful eye of matriarch Nancy \u2014 there\u2019s an unexpected ring of the doorbell. Unexpected for everyone but Nancy, who has secretly invited a genteel Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 and her eligible grandson to dinner, in hopes of fixing up her unwed pregnant granddaughter with a suitable partner.\n\nIt\u2019s a bravura role for Moriarty, the actress who burst onto the scene as a teenager in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Raging Bull, playing the wife of Jake La Motta, a part that would earn her an Academy Award nomination. Here, as Nancy, she\u2019s histrionic, a touch domineering but altogether charming. Text on screen notes she\u2019s \u201cItalian by marriage. Hobbies include: The Ten Commandments.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s someone who I think has such a strong presence, has always had a strong presence as an actor. And of course, Raging Bull, her iconic scenes always inspired me in the films that I\u2019ve made. Scorsese, De Niro, those types of films, as an Italian American I grew up watching,\u201d Campanella says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we were going to be able to get her. We shared the script with her agents or team, and she resonated with the story and it kind of just went from there. For her character, it was super important to have someone like Cathy because she does, first of all, a lot of the talking in the short. It really had to feel like vocally, physically there\u2019s this person who can deliver that energy. She did wonderful. She\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nThe plot, and the sauce, thicken in the short when Gino and the cute young dinner guest Marco (Campanella) lock eyes. It turns out they have \u201cmet\u201d before, in a manner of speaking. The opening scene establishes that the \u201cdaddy\u201d and the \u201ctwunk\u201d as they label themselves in an online dating app, have expressed a certain attraction for each other, shall we say, without every realizing they would soon encounter one another face to face.\n\nCampanella describes the production as \u201ca full family effort,\u201d and with good reason. He and his older brother Anthony produced the film. His dad\u2019s first cousin, who is an Italian teacher, consulted on the Italian dialogue in the script. Campanella\u2019s aunt Maria Carrozza plays the comatose woman. And his real-life grandma, Vincenza Campanella, plays his on-screen nonna, although that wasn\u2019t the original plan.\n\n\u201cOur wonderful casting director, Joey Montenarello, we were working together to try to find this sort of grandmother figure who felt very fresh-off-the-boat Italian, someone who felt like they immigrated from Italy; Italian was their first language. It was quite difficult to find someone who actually fit all of those [criteria] and have this specific demeanor,\u201d Campanella explains. \u201cMy brother who produced the film with me actually had the idea. He said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we go to \u2018Nonni\u2019 and just read the lines with her and see if she\u2019ll do it? \u2018And we did. And she was actually wonderful.\u201d\n\nSome of the funniest moments in the film occur as Campanella\u2019s grandmother, playing \u201cAntonella,\u201d voices growing displeasure with the character of her hosts \u2013 her candid remarks spoken in Italian, which eludes others around the table, except for her grandson. Her language is saltier than the salad dressing.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother, my real life \u2018Nonni,\u2019 she is very much a saint. She has not said any of these words in real life,\u201d Campanella shares. \u201cAnd she was laughing when we were reading them. She was like, \u2018I haven\u2019t said any of these words ever that she says in the film.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe director\u2019s family made further contributions to Sunday Sauce. \u201cMy mother was cooking the crafty [craft services] and cooking the meals every day,\u201d the director says. \u201cIt was about family, it was about food \u2014 why not have my real Italian mother who\u2019s an incredible cook, who would cook it better in my opinion than just a random catering come in and do that? And that made it really special. Some of the crew people said it was the best crafty that they ever had.\u201d\n\nCampanella is cooking up a feature length version of Sunday Sauce.\n\n\u201cWe have the script complete,\u201d he says. \u201cThe great thing about making the short was that it really allowed me as a director and a filmmaker to understand the visual language and the world a little bit better. It was really important for me to make this into a short before feature because it\u2019s such a unique concept and it weaves in black comedy, surrealism, a little bit of body horror and that heart that you feel for this character [Gino] who\u2019s actually struggling with something. So I think it was really important for me, creatively, to make it for that reason, but also to show other people in the business this is possible, what the vision is.\u201d\n\u2022 None Everything We Know About \u2018Nobody Wants This\u2019 Season 2 So Far\n\u2022 None Everything We Know About Prime Video's \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 Prequel Series \u2018Elle\u2019\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
