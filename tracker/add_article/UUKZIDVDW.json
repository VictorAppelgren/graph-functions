The trust will no longer rely on an SEC exemptive order to distribute long‑term capital gains more frequently, instead distributing taxable income monthly and long‑term gains annually. Distributions may include return of capital and can be adjusted by the board to reflect income fluctuations, with no guarantee of a fixed rate or schedule.",
