      "summary": "Aluminum and copper are the most common heatsink materials, offering a balance of cost, weight, and thermal conductivity (205 W/mK and 401 W/mK, respectively). Copper conducts heat better than aluminum but is heavier, while aluminum is lighter and easier to manufacture. Silver and diamond have higher conductivities (≈430 W/mK and 2,200–2,500 W/mK) but are too expensive for mass production. Graphite and graphene provide intermediate options, though they are less widely used. The choice ultimately depends on trade‑offs among conductivity, weight, durability, and cost.",
