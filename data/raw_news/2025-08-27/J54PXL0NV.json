According to a statement contained in the court ruling, Cade\u2019s move was deemed \u201cdisproportionate and premature,\u201d as it failed to weigh environmental analyses tied to the agreement.\n\nThe soy moratorium, introduced in 2006, has been credited with slowing deforestation in one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable ecosystems. It is enforced by industry representatives and 30 of Brazil\u2019s largest exporters, many of whom have faced international pressure\u2014particularly from the European Union\u2014to address forest destruction. Per a statement from Greenpeace Brazil, lifting the moratorium risked accelerating deforestation across the Amazon.\n\nBrazil remains the world\u2019s largest exporter of soybeans, shipping nearly 97 million tons between January and November 2024, according to the state-owned National Supply Company. The pact requires traders not to buy soy cultivated on land cleared after 2008, a key safeguard against unchecked expansion.\n\nThe now-overturned Cade decision had sparked backlash among environmental and climate advocates. The regulator had given traders just ten days to withdraw from the agreement or risk facing substantial fines. Brazil\u2019s powerful agribusiness sector, backed by significant congressional support, has been lobbying for the pact\u2019s removal in order to expand soybean production deeper into forested areas.\n\nData cited in a report on the moratorium showed that soybean cultivation in the Amazon surged 344 percent between 2009 and 2022. Yet during the same period, deforestation decreased by 69 percent in regions monitored under the agreement, highlighting its environmental impact.",
