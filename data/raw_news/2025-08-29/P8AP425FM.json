  "description": "The JCPenney in the Westminster Mall in Orange County, California, will be open to the public through Nov. 16.",
  "content": "\u2022 JCPenney is closing its location inside the Westminster Mall in Orange County, California.\n\u2022 The store will remain open to the public through Nov. 16. The store will close on or about Nov. 21.\n\u2022 Seventy-six employees who work at the store will be affected by its closure.\n\nJCPenney is closing yet another location, this time in Orange County, California.\n\nJCPenney will close its location in the Westminster Mall on or about Nov. 21, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Notice filed on Aug. 18, obtained by USA TODAY. The store will remain open to the public through Nov. 16.\n\nSeventy-six employees work at the location and will be affected by the closure, the WARN Notice states. These employees may be offered employment at other JCPenney locations, dependent on business needs and associate interests.\n\n\"Closing the store was a difficult decision. We thank you for the time and effort you have dedicated to JCPenney,\" reads a letter to associates at the location, obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nJCPenney was unable to continue its lease at the mall and has been unable to find another location in the area, according to a JCPenney statement obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThis particular JCPenney store opened in August 1974, coinciding with the grand opening of the Westminster Mall. JCPenney is one of the mall's anchor stores, along with Macy's and Target. The former of which is also closing this year, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nThe Orange County closure comes after JCPenney announced in July that the Boston private equity firm Onyx Partners, Ltd., purchased 119 stores for $947 million. The companies expect to close the deal by Sept. 8.\n\nProperty management companies Newmark and Hilco Real Estate have been seeking buyers for these JCPenney locations for Copper Property, a trust formed by JCPenney's lenders as part of the retailer's reorganization after its 2020 bankruptcy filing.\n\nFollowing JCPenney's bankruptcy, Copper Property took control of about 160 JCPenney locations and six distribution centers. Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. took over JCPenney operations and the remaining locations. The department store chain, which currently has about 650 stores, is one of the largest retailers to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe money from the acquisition will go to JCPenney's creditors. After closing costs, $928 million to $932 million will be distributed, principal financial officer Larry Finger said during a conference call discussing the transaction on July 28.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "More store closings in 2021? These are the most vulnerable major retailers of 2021 as pandemic continues\nFor retailers that survived the catastrophe that was 2020, there's hope on the horizon in 2021.\nBut there's no guarantee they'll keep their engines running long enough to reach the light at the end of the tunnel.\nWhile 2020 was a mess for many retailers, leading to the liquidation of chains like Stein Mart and Pier 1 Imports, it was a boon to others, like Walmart, Target and Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\"If you\u2019re in a sector like department stores or specialty or off-price or apparel, you suffered the most in 2020,\" said Mickey Chadha, vice president and senior credit officer of Moody's Investor Service, who studies the retail sector.\nSave better, send better: We'll tell you how and send money tips, advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here\nMore J.C. Penney store closings: After exiting bankruptcy, 15 additional stores will shutter in spring 2021. See the list.\nDespite the crushing shutdowns that temporarily brought physical sales to a standstill in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic across the nation, the industry's struggling retailers are now hoping that a nationwide vaccination campaign will bring them back from the brink.\nRestrictions still continue in California and other states also continue to limit the number of shoppers that can enter stores. Apple temporarily closed all 53 of its California stores again and about a dozen other stores across the country because of COVID-19 surges.\n\"It really comes down to how long COVID persists,\" said Chris Hudgins, who analyzes retail data for research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"If we see this vaccine roll out and a lot of the cases come down and people go out and start shopping more, that will alleviate some strain on the retail sector.\"\nThere's one bright spot retailers are in a position to benefit from: E-commerce sales growth has been enormous and is expected to continue. Moody's projected growth of 14% to 15% for e-commerce sales in 2021, even as people are expected to return to stores as the pandemic ebbs.\nHere's a list of major retailers for whom 2021 could be a make-or-break year based on USA TODAY research, public data and analyst reports:\nJ.C. Penney\nThe department store chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May after its sales collapsed amid temporary store closures.\nThe company was at risk of total liquidation for months as it negotiated with its creditors. After reaching a deal to sell to a consortium of property owners, including mall company Simon Property Group, J.C. Penney emerged from bankruptcy in December having closed more than 150 stores.\nWhile that's good news for fans of the chain founded by James Cash Penney that remains an icon of the era when shopping malls dominated American retail, it's not out of the woods yet. 2021 will be crucial to whether J.C. Penney can prove its relevance to consumers who grew more comfortable than ever with online shopping in 2020.\n\"For a long time, we\u2019ve seen foot traffic at department stores declining,\" Hudgins said.\nAnother 15 stores have been added to the chopping block and are scheduled to close by the end of March and it's possible more closings could be added.\nSears and Kmart\nYou might think they're already out of business since thousands of their stores have closed in recent years, but they're not gone.\nBoth chains were owned by a company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2018 and narrowly escaped liquidation in early 2019. They were sold to their longtime investor and CEO, Eddie Lampert, who has kept them alive on a shoestring budget.\nIn February 2020, another 51 Sears and 45 Kmart locations closed, leaving some 182 surviving stores. There have been additional closings but no large closing announcements have been made since then.\nWhile Sears and Kmart are a shadow of their former selves, they remain in operation. But given that they have been struggling for ages in healthy times, experts say it's hard to see how they can mount a turnaround during or in the wake of a pandemic.\nRite Aid\nRite Aid's outlook has been gloomy for several years and Moody's considers the company to be a \"very high credit risk.\"\nThe company is stuck in an uncomfortable netherworld: not big enough to present a big threat to drugstore rivals Walgreens and CVS but not agile or rich enough to reinvent itself.\nA few bad breaks haven't helped: A merger deal with grocery chain Albertsons collapsed in 2018, leaving the company's path to reinvention unclear.\nPlans for a mega-merger between Walgreens and Fred's also collapsed in June 2017 amid federal antitrust concerns.\nLike Moody's, S&P Global Ratings views Rite Aid as facing a risk of failing to meet its financial obligations if something goes wrong.\nParty City\nQuite simply, it's a tough time to be selling party goods when parties are, in some states, illegal.\nGiven restrictions on large gatherings intended to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus, the market for balloons, streamers, party decorations and costumes is naturally limited.\nParty City was already facing challenges before this crisis began. The company has closed 76 stores since 2019, most of them before the pandemic, leaving it with 739 locations as of Sept. 30.\nIts financial troubles mounted in 2020. The company posted a loss of $432 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared with a loss of $264 million in the same period of 2019.\nJo-Ann Stores\nThis fabrics retailer remains on the edge of trouble. Owned by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, Jo-Ann faces the challenge of digging out of debt while dealing with the retail industry's other challenges.\nPrivate-equity ownership has been a problem for many other retailers in recent years, such as Toys R Us, which liquidated after accumulating too much debt and facing intense competition.\n\"A lot of the weaker players that we have now in the distressed space are still owned by private equity firms and still have weak balance sheets,\" Moody's executive Chadha said. \"And those companies are going to find it difficult, even when things normalize, to compete with stronger players that got stronger in 2020 because it\u2019s just going to be that much more competitive.\"\nNeiman Marcus\nOne of the first major retailers to file for bankruptcy protection during the pandemic, Neiman Marcus entered Chapter 11 in early May.\nIt successfully navigated the debt-cutting process and emerged from bankruptcy in September, giving it another shot at achieving sustainability.\nBut time could be running out for the department store model. Neiman Marcus is already on Moody's list of vulnerable retailers based on their financial circumstances.\nTuesday Morning\nTuesday Morning was already struggling when the coronavirus pandemic began and went into a free fall when it was forced to temporarily close its locations due to the crisis.\nThe off-price retailer \u2013 which sells a wide variety of merchandise including home decor, bath and body goods, crafts, food, and toys \u2013 filed for bankruptcy protection in May. The company said it expected to stay in business while using the bankruptcy process to restructure operations.\nAs of Sept. 30, it had 490 states in 40 states after closing 197 stores as part of its reorganization plans.\nChristopher & Banks\nApparel retailer Christopher & Banks, which caters to women over 40, announced on Dec. 10 that it hired strategic advisers including B. Riley Securities Inc. and is working to refinance debt and explore alternatives.\nThe Minneapolis-based company obtained a $10 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program in June.\n\u201cWe believe that COVID has had an outsized impact on our customer demographic as her shopping behavior is more pragmatic with limited demand for new outfits in the absence of social engagements,\" Keri Jones, president and CEO, said in a statement on Dec. 10. \"In addition, based on our own retail traffic trends we believe she remains hesitant to shop in stores.\"\nAs of Oct. 31, the company operated 452 stores in 44 states, including 316 Missy, Petite, Women stores, 77 outlet stores, 31 Christopher & Banks stores, and 28 C.J. Banks stores.\nJones said COVID-19 was expected to continue to depress sales over the next several months.\nJ. Jill\nThe women's retailer announced in September that it had worked with lenders to restructure its debt out of court. The company, which has more than 280 stores nationwide, had signaled it would consider filing for bankruptcy.\nInterim CEO James S. Scully said in December that the company's third-quarter results showed improvement because stores were open for the entire quarter versus the temporary closures from the second quarter. A permanent CEO, Claire Spofford, will join the company in early 2021.\nMacy's\nMacy's announced in February 2020 that it planned to cut 2,000 jobs and close one-fifth of its stores or roughly 125 locations over the next couple of years while also opening smaller stores that are not located in malls.\nMacy's along with other department store chains temporarily shuttered all of its stores amid the pandemic in mid-March. The company, which includes Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, started reopening stores in May and added curbside pickup.\nMacy's appears to be in better shape than some of its competitors. In June, officials said the company received a credit line of $3.15 billion backed by its inventory, bringing its total new financing to $4.5 billion.\nIn September, Macy's Inc. Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette said the timeline for permanent store closings could be adjusted as the company monitors the competition and the recovery from the pandemic.\n\"Retail today has been disrupted. And while that disruption creates challenges, it also holds opportunity,\" Gennette told analysts during the September quarterly earnings call. \"With many competitors closing or struggling, we see the potential to bring new customers into our brands and gain market share.\"\nIn November, Gennette said the company entered the quarter \"in a stronger than expected position.\"\nAscena Retail Group\nAlso listed on USA TODAY's 2020 list of struggling retailers, Ascena Retail Group, the parent company of Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor, which filed for bankruptcy in July.\nThe New Jersey-based company said at the time of the Chapter 11 filing that it plans to \"reduce their store fleet from approximately 2,800 stores to approximately 1,200 stores,\" which represents a 56% reduction in the company's total number of stores.\nThe company shuttered all of its Catherines plus-size stores and in November announced it sold the rights, title, licenses and e-commerce business of its Justice tween brand to management company Bluestar Alliance LLC. Most Justice stores have already closed and the remaining locations are expected to close in early 2021.\nOn Dec. 23, the company announced it sold Ann Taylor, Loft, Lou & Grey and Lane Bryant brands to Sycamore Brands, a New York private equity firm. Ascena also sold two of its brands, Maurices and Dressbarn, in 2019 before bankruptcy.\nBed Bath & Beyond\nEven before the pandemic, Bed Bath & Beyond planned to close stores but in July the number increased to 200 planned closures, accounting for some 21% of the company's namesake stores.\nIn September, the New Jersey-based home goods retailer \u2013 which also operates buybuy Baby and Harmon Face Values \u2013 revealed the first 63 namesake stores that would shutter as part of the plan by the end of 2020. In late October, company officials said the 200 stores are expected to close by the end of the 2021 fiscal year.\nUnder the leadership of CEO Mark Tritton, who joined Bed Bath & Beyond in November 2019 from Target, the company has been selling some of its brands.\nOn Dec. 14, the company announced it was selling Cost Plus World Market, which has 243 stores, to Los Angeles-based private equity firm Kingswood Capital Management. Bed Bath & Beyond sold its Christmas Tree Shops brand with 80 stores in November.\nVictoria's Secret\nIn May, L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, said it would permanently close approximately 250 stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2020.\nAs of the end of October, the company reported it had closed 223 Victoria's Secret stores and three Pink locations and opened 18 new Victoria's Secret and two Pink stores. It also closed 13 of its 38 stores in Canada.\nWith the openings and closings, it has 704 Victoria's Secret and 143 Pink stores.\nIn February, L Brands announced a deal to sell 55% of Victoria\u2019s Secret to Sycamore Partners. After the pandemic struck, Sycamore went to court to back out of the deal and in early May, both parties called it off.\n\u201cWe would expect to have a meaningful number of additional store closures beyond the 250 that we're pursuing this year, meaning there will be more in 2021 and probably a bit more in 2022,\u201d interim Victoria\u2019s Secret CEO Stuart Burgdoerfer told analysts in May.\nCompany officials said they still plan to separate Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works into two companies, which has pleased investors.\nDespite sales improving in the third quarter, L Brands CEO Andrew Meslow said in November the company was cautious \"given anticipated constraints on store traffic, online fulfillment and shipping capacity, as well as other uncertainties related to the COVID pandemic.\"\nExpress\nFashion retailer Express launched a turnaround plan in January 2020 and announced it would close 100 of its 600 stores.\nExpress CEO Timothy Baxter told the Wall Street Journal in December that the company had hired investment bank Lazard Fr\u00e8res & Co. to help raise enough financing to carry the company through the pandemic.\nEarlier in December, the company said it had completed a 10% workforce reduction at its Columbus, Ohio, corporate office.\nThe reductions are expected to save $13 million in 2021 in addition to the $95 million cash tax benefit the company expects to receive in the second quarter of 2021 as part of the CARES Act.\nFollow USA TODAY reporters Nathan Bomey and Kelly Tyko on Twitter @NathanBomey and @KellyTyko."

      "text": "Would you pay $160 for lipstick? Louis Vuitton's first makeup line, La Beaut\u00e9, sparks debate\n\"It's a luxury brand. Everyone is not meant to have it,\" TikToker Rakeedah Bell said.\nWould you pay $160 for a lipstick? Louis Vuitton seems to think some will.\nOn Monday, Aug. 25, Louis Vuitton released its first cosmetics collection, La Beaut\u00e9. The luxury line was crafted by Dame Pat McGrath, a world-renowned makeup artist, and features lipsticks, lip balms and eyeshadows.\nThe line was teased back in March, but product images and prices were released early last week. Professional makeup artists, makeup enthusiasts and folks who just enjoy a good Chapstick took to social media to share their awe for the line. Some were overjoyed with the lines' luxurious appearance and traditional color palette, while others couldn't get over the retail price, with one lipstick starting at $160.\nThe line is available at select Louis Vuitton stores and the Louis Vuitton website starting on Friday, Aug. 29.\nHere's what we know about La Beaut\u00e9, including what the collection includes, the full breakdown and how makeup enthusiasts feel about it all.\nWhat does the La Beaut\u00e9 collection include?\nThe debut collection features more than 70 products. Here's a look:\nRouge Complete Lipsticks\nThe La Beaut\u00e9 collection features 55 Rouge Complete Lipsticks, including 27 \"creamy satin hues\" and 28 \"velvety matte shades,\" according to a Louis Vuitton news release.\nThe lipsticks are made with natural waxes from rose, jasmine and mimosa flowers; shea butter; and hyaluronic acid, according to the news release.\nBaume Complete Lip Balm\nIn addition to the vibrant lipsticks, the collection features 10 Baume Complete Lip Balms, made with shea butter and hyaluronic acid, according to the news release. The balms are lightly tinted, including a burgundy brown, pink pearl and rosewood.\nEach lipstick and lip balm features a fragrance, designed by Louis Vuitton Master Perfumer Jacques Cavallier Belletrud, the news release states. The lipsticks feature mimosa, jasmine and rose scents, and the balms feature mint and raspberry.\nOmbres Complete Eyeshadows\nThe line is rounded out with eight eyeshadow palettes, each featuring four shades. The news release states that each palette contains three \"wearable, everyday shades, with one unexpected twist.\" The palettes include both matte and glitter shadows.\nThe eyeshadows are made with plant-derived squalane, known for protecting the skin, and camelina flower oil extract, the news release states.\nEach product, lipstick, lip balm and eyeshadow, is refillable.\nThe makeup pigments, scents and ingredients were not the only details considered in the collection's making.\nGerman designer Konstantin Grcic designed each of the product's packaging. An example detail \u2013 each lipstick's name and shade is engraved on the refill and a window at the top of the product. Grcic also crafted the floral motif lock system on each product.\nLa Beaut\u00e9 prices\nHere's a breakdown of the prices for products in the new La Beaut\u00e9 line:\n- Rouge Complete Lipstick: $160\n- Baume Complete Lip Balm: $160\n- Ombres Complete Eyeshadows: $250\n- Rouge and Baume Refills: $69\n- Ombres Refills: $92\nHow do other luxury beauty brands compare?\nIn social media videos, blogs and beauty publication stories, makeup artists and enthusiasts alike are comparing La Beaut\u00e9 to other luxury cosmetic brands. Here's a look at where some other high-end prices stack up for lipsticks, specifically:\n- Herm\u00e8s Silky Lipstick Shine: $81\n- Guerlain Ultra-Care Lipstick: $80\n- Gucci Rouge \u00e0 L\u00e8vres Lipstick: $50\n- Prada Monochrome Lipstick: $50\n- Chanel Rouge Lipstick: $48-52\nIs the price point worth it? The internet is divided\nSocial media posters were divided on whether the high cost is worth it or not for Louis Vuitton's latest venture.\nLifestyle content creator Erin Nicole, who has been reviewing luxury beauty products on YouTube for a decade, said she is disappointed by the cost. She had hoped the lipsticks would start at under $100.\n\"I wish the price point was more widely accessible, especially for beauty junkies like me who are excited to support the iconic 'Mother' Pat McGrath,\" Nicole told USA TODAY. \"There are too many established competitors in the luxury market, I'm not sure the (Louis Vuitton) lipstick will really stand the test of time at $160.\"\nDominicia Baird, who goes by PhD in Pretty on social media, criticized the price of La Beaut\u00e9 in a recent TikTok video. She was surprised to see the prices rise above McGrath's own line. For reference, McGrath's Mothership eyeshadow palettes, which feature a minimum of nine shades, start at $128 on her website \u2013 in comparison to Louis' $250 for four shades.\nBut others aren't fazed.\nIn a recent TikTok video, content creator Rakeedah Bell said the new makeup line isn't supposed to be accessible.\n\"It's a luxury brand. Everyone is not meant to have it, and I don't say that as, like, I'm rolling around in Beyonc\u00e9 money,\" Bell said. \"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely think $160 for a lipstick is ridiculous. I'm not here to say that it's not. My argument is, why do we do this? It's Louis Vuitton. What did we expect? It's a designer house. It's in the name.\"\nShades leave some makeup artists wanting more\nLa Beaut\u00e9 features more than 70 products, but some feel the pickings are too slim.\nMakeup content creator Sarah Meister said she finds makeup lines from other luxury brands, like Gucci, Prada and Herm\u00e8s, more \"imaginative.\"\n\"La Beaut\u00e9 by Louis Vuitton color range doesn\u2019t interest me, the product finishes and textures look very standard, and the packaging, while perfectly fine-looking, doesn\u2019t stand out amongst the crowd,\" Meister told USA TODAY.\nCelebrity makeup artist Alexis Oakley, who has worked with names like Demi Lovato and Tana Mongeau, told USA TODAY that she wishes the line had started with a more diverse variety of products.\n\"Maybe a complexion range to showcase inclusivity or some innovative textures that stand out in the crowded luxury beauty market,\" she said.\nAre luxury makeup brands worth the cost?\nAcross the board, the makeup enthusiasts who spoke with USA TODAY said yes, luxury brands can be worth the cost, though there are plenty of great options on a more affordable budget.\nBaird said luxury products can be worth the cost if they are meaningful to the buyer.\n\"Some people will fall in love with the Louis Vuitton connection or with a particular shade, while others find that same sense of value in a Maybelline lipstick because of the color or performance,\" she said. \"What makes it worth it is if it brings the person joy.\"\nNicole echoed Baird's sentiment.\n\"The key is investing in the right luxury products that you genuinely love and enjoy,\" Nicole said. \"As long as you can afford it and it makes you feel confident, let's allow people, especially women, to enjoy the little things like applying our favorite lipsticks.\"\nWould you pay $160 for a Louis Vuitton lipstick?

See list of locations.\nAbout five years after JCPenney filed for bankruptcy, a Boston private equity firm will pay $947 million for 119 JCPenney stores.\nThe all-cash sale of 119 JCPenney properties to an affiliate of Onyx Partners, Ltd. was announced by Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust on July 25. The companies expect a Sept. 8 closing of the deal for the net-lease stores, which pay rent and operating expenses.\nProperty management company Newmark and Hilco Real Estate had been seeking buyers for these JCPenney locations for Copper Property, a trust formed by JCPenney's lenders as part of the retailer's reorganization after its 2020 bankruptcy filing. \"The Buyer has now completed its due diligence, and its deposit under the Agreement is non-refundable,\" Copper Property Trust said in a news release on July 25.\nFollowing JCPenney's bankruptcy, Copper Property took control of about 160 JCPenney locations and six distribution centers. Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. took over JCPenney operations and the remaining locations. The department store chain, which currently has about 650 stores, was one of the largest retailers to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nThe money from the transaction will go to JCPenney creditors. After closing costs, between $928 million and $932 million will be distributed, principal financial officer Larry Finger said on July 28 during a conference call discussing the transaction.\nJCPenney stores sold: Will all remain open?\nAll 119 stores that were sold are currently operational.

(29 USC 2101 and 20 CFR 639.3) | Applicable to a \u201ccovered establishment\u201d that employs or has employed in the preceding 12 months, 75 or more full and part-time employees. As under the federal WARN, employees must have been employed for at least 6 months of the 12 months preceding the date of required notice in order to be counted. [California Labor Code Section 1400.5 (a) and (h)] |\n| Mass Layoff, Termination, Relocation or Relocation of a Call Center | Plant closings involving 50 or more employees during a 30-day period. Layoffs within a 30-day period involving 50 to 499 full-time employees constituting at least 33% of the full-time workforce at a single site of employment. Layoffs of 500 or more are covered regardless of percentage of workforce. (29 USC, et seq., 2101 and 20 CFR 639.3) | Plant closure affecting any amount of employees. Layoff of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period regardless of % of workforce. Relocation of at least 100 miles affecting any amount of employees. Relocation of a call center to a foreign country regardless of the percentage of workforce affected. [California Labor Code Section 1400.5 (d)-(f) and 1409 (b)] |\n| Legal Jurisdiction | Enforcement of WARN requirements through United States district courts. The court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs. (29 USC 2101, et seq) | Civil action may be brought in \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction\u201d related to a Mass Layoff, Termination, Relocation, or Relocation of a Call Center. The court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as part of costs to any prevailing plaintiff. The California WARN law is in the Labor Code and the authority to investigate through the examination of books and records is delegated to the Labor Commissioner. The Labor Commissioner may enforce the notice requirements, including investigating an alleged violation and ordering appropriate temporary relief to mitigate the violation pending the completion of a full investigation or hearing. (California Labor Code Sections 1404 and 1406) |\n| Employer Liability | An employer who violates the WARN provisions is liable to each employee for an amount equal to back pay and benefits for the period of the violation, up to 60 days, but no more than half the number of days the employee was employed by the employer. [29 USC; 2104 (a)]. |\nA possible civil penalty of $500 a day for each day of violation. Employees may receive back pay to be paid at employee\u2019s final rate or 3-year average rate of compensation, whichever is higher. In addition, employer is liable for cost of any medical expenses incurred by employees that would have been covered under an employee benefit plan. The employer is liable for period of violation up to 60 days or one-half the number of days the employee was employed whichever period is smaller. (California Labor Code Section 1403) A call center employer who does not provide notice is ineligible to be awarded or have renewed any direct or indirect state grants or state-guaranteed loans for five years and shall be ineligible to claim a tax credit -for five taxable years. (California Labor Code Section 1411 (a)) |\n| Notice Requirements | An Employer must provide written notice 60-days prior to a plant closing or mass layoff to employees or their representative, the State dislocated worker unit (the Employment Development Department, Workforce Services Division in California), and the chief elected official of local government within which such closing or layoff is to occur. (29 USC, 2102; 20 CFR 639.5) | An employer must give notice 60-days prior to a mass layoff, termination, relocation, or relocation of a call center. In addition to the notifications required under federal WARN, notice must also be given to the Local Workforce Development Board, and the chief elected official of each city and county government within which the termination, relocation or mass layoff occurs. (California Labor Code Section 1401) |\n| Exceptions and Exemptions to Notice Requirements |\nRegular Federal, State, local and federally recognized Indian tribal governments are not covered. The following situations are exempt from notice: There is an offer to transfer employee to a different site within a reasonable commuting distance. The closure is due to unforeseeable business circumstances, a natural disaster. The closing or layoff constitutes a strike or constitutes a lockout not intended to evade the requirement of this chapter. |\nCalifornia WARN does not apply when the closing or layoff is the result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking of an employer subject to Wage Orders 11, 12 or 16, regulating the Motion Picture Industry, or Construction, Drilling, Logging and Mining Industries, and the employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of that project or undertaking. The notice requirements do not apply to employees involved in seasonal employment where the employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was seasonal and temporary. Notice is not required if a mass layoff, relocation or plant closure is necessitated by a physical calamity or act of war. Notice of a relocation or termination is not required where, under multiple and specific conditions, the employer submits documents to the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) and the DIR determines that the employer was actively seeking capital or business, and a WARN notice would have precluded the employer from obtaining the capital or business. (California Labor Code Section 1402.5) This exception does not apply to notice of a mass layoff as defined in California Labor Code Section 1400.5 (d). |\nWork Sharing Program\nThinking about layoffs? Instead, apply for the Work Sharing Program. Cut hours and wages while we pay partial unemployment benefits. Keep great employees! Avoid the cost of hiring and training new employees when your business or the economy improves. This program has less impact on your unemployment taxes than a full layoff, and it can positively affect employee morale and loyalty.\nSenate Bill (SB) No. 1089 \u2013 Grocery and Pharmacy Closures\nEffective January 1, 2025, SB 1089 requires that certain grocery stores and pharmacies provide written notice of their closure to the EDD and other specified entities no later than 45 days before the closure takes effect. This notification requirement is separate from the WARN Notice. If the closure meets the conditions requiring a WARN Notice, employers are not required to issue a separate SB 1089 closure notice to the EDD. Review the SB 1089 Frequently Ask Questions to learn more."

      "text": "Cracker Barrel stock dips after rebranding backlash. What to know\nCracker Barrel is facing widespread backlash after rolling out a new logo and plans to update its restaurants to a more modern style.\nOn Aug. 19, the chain restaurant announced changes to its logo and menu as part of a campaign titled \"All the More.\" The rebrand features new and returning menu items, \"refreshed\" restaurant remodels and an \"enhanced brand look and feel,\" according to a news release.\nDespite the chain's excitement in its announcement, many were disappointed, and even outraged, by the change. Customers were so upset, in fact, that the chain saw an almost $10 drop in stock value over the course of one day.\nHere's what you need to know about the company's current financial situation.\nHow much has Cracker Barrel stock dropped?\nCracker Barrel's announcement on Aug. 19 didn't attract national attention until late on Aug. 20, which is reflected in the company's stock value.\nWhen the market closed on Aug. 20, shares were valued at $59.02. However, they took a sharp turn midday on Aug. 21, with stock prices falling to $50.76 by midday. By the end of the trading day, the prices had recovered slightly to $54.80 a share.\nWhile this may seem like a major hit for the company, it's not the lowest shares have been for the organization this year. The company reached a high in late January, when its shares were valued at $64.98, but they soon began to drop and hit a year-low of $35.11 in early April.\nThe peak value of shares this year was on July 23, only four weeks ago, when stocks were valued at $71.86.\nWhat does Cracker Barrel's new logo look like?\nWhile still featuring the company's classic gold and brown color palette, the new Cracker Barrel logo offers a simplified version that no longer depicts a man seated next to a wooden barrel.\nThe new logo includes the restaurant's name in brown lettering against a golden yellow border.\nThe rebrand comes as Cracker Barrel continues renovations at some of its locations around the country, giving restaurants a more modern facelift.\nCONTRIBUTING: Stephen J.

In 2024, de minimis shipments were valued at more than $1.36 billion, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nThis means consumers may see higher costs and possible supply disruptions, as the Trump administration effectively ends the duty-free program across the board.\nIn preparation of the change, Reuters reports postal groups in several European counties have announced they will pause standard parcel shipments to the U.S. Austria's postal service cited both the scrapping of the de minimis exemption as well as uncertainty over future U.S. postal customs clearance as reasons for its move.\n\"This tightening poses major challenges for all postal companies worldwide when sending goods to the USA,\" Austria Post said.\nHere's what to know about the de minimis exception and how its end could impact consumers.\nWhat is the de minimis exception?\nThe de minimis exemption refers to Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which allows the Secretary of the Treasury to waive some duties or fees where it is more inconvenient to collect the tax than the revenue would be worth. In practice, the policy allowed companies to ship low-value packages to the U.S. tariff-free. The Trump administration said in April, before the executive order ending the exemptions, that Customs and Border Patrol processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.\nThe exception has been the subject of back-and-forth over the past few months between the Trump administration and China, and it hit an early speed bump. It was originally set to end in February, but it was then postponed after packages began piling up without time to plan and execute the policy change.\nThe Aug. 29 deadline comes a few months after the loophole was closed on May 2 for imports, specifically from China and Hong Kong, where behemoth low-value retailers like Shein and Temu ship a significant portion of their products from. Over half of all packages with de minimis exemptions come from China, and more than 30% of all daily packages shipped under de minimis are from Temu and Shein, Reuters reported in February.\nThe two popular online retailers sell a wide range of products, including clothes and linens, toys, home goods and electronics. Both retailers gained popularity in the U.S. over the past several years, thanks in part to the de minimis exemption, which helped the companies keep prices low.\nBoth Temu and Shein experienced a sharp decline in sales growth and customer growth rates since Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs, according to data collected by consultancy Bain & Company, per Reuters. Engagement on Temu has also dropped significantly following the end of the de minimis exemption, said Morgan Stanley equity analyst Simeon Gutman in a May note.\nHow will the end of de minimis impact consumers?\nWith the end of the exception now just days away for imports from all other nations, the same impacts that Shein and Temu have wrestled with may soon hit other low-value goods retailers.\nErnie Tedeschi, director of economics at Yale Budget Lab, said the end of de minimis could affect health and beauty items, apparel, household goods and various bespoke or boutique items that are imported.\n\"For consumers that are shopping at a lot of big name-brand stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, this is not relevant to them,\" Tedeschi said. \"Those stores have already been hit by tariff increases, and so that should be incorporated into those prices at the moment.\"\nYet, shoppers may see a disruption in availability or stock before they notice any price hikes, according to Tedeschi. He pointed to the package pile-up when Trump first tried ending the exemption, forcing the administration to put the order on hold after more than a million packages piled up at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\"It's not clear to me that the administration has solved that problem yet,\" Tedeschi said. \"All of that means that the initial effect that consumers see may not be an increase in price, at least initially, it may just be that goods are not there at all, goods that previously came in from de minimis.\"\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Italian Kitchen and Brio Italian Grille have filed for Chapter 11, the restaurant chains' second bankruptcy in just more than five years.\nBravo Brio Restaurants LLC, which includes 25 Brio Italian Grille restaurants and 23 Bravo Italian Kitchen restaurants, had closed seven restaurants before filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida on Aug. 18. The company cited \"the acute financial distress\" across the restaurant industry, which has led to recent bankruptcy filings by Red Lobster, Tijuana Flats, TGI Fridays and Hooters, it states in the filing.\nEarl Enterprises, which also owns Planet Hollywood, Bertucci's and other restaurants, acquired the restaurants in June 2020 from FoodFirst Global Restaurants, which had filed for bankruptcy two months earlier.\nThrough the bankruptcy proceedings, Bravo Brio Restaurants seeks \"to improve its financial position as it brings on a new investor,\" the company said in a news release. \"The Chapter 11 process will allow the Company to quickly and efficiently reorganize its business for a sustainable and successful future, including closing underperforming locations, restructuring debt, and streamlining and reducing operational expenses.\"\nWill Brio locations close following bankruptcy filing?\nA spokesperson told Today.com there are no current plans to close any locations. The company did not respond to USA TODAY's questions about any immediate closings.\nLocations in Virginia and Missouri were closed earlier in the year, according to local news reports. A Brio restaurant in Beavercreek, Ohio, closed the same day as the filing, according to WHIO. Another location in Delaware closed concurrently with the bankruptcy filing, reported Delaware Online, part of the USA TODAY Network.\nThe company listed assets of $50 million to $100 million, including furniture, restaurant equipment and inventory valued at about $25 million. Liabilities of more than $50 million include wages of $900,000 currently owed to employees and $1.9 million owed to food provider Sysco, according to the filing.\n\"The Debtors have worked diligently to weather the storm, but earnings and cash flow remain strained by several above-market leases and underperforming locations,\" the filing reads.\nCurrent restaurants will continue operating during the bankruptcy process, the company said.\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.
