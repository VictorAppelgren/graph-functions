      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but still reads like a list of facts rather than a coherent, world‑class view. Tighten the narrative by (1) grouping the three regimes into a concise table that shows the key drivers (wage growth, inflation persistence, policy signals, semiconductor capex) and the expected yield‑curve, equity, and currency outcomes; (2) replace vague “double‑digit gains” with a quantified range (e.g., S&P 500 +12 % ± 3 % over 12 mo, Nasdaq +15 % ± 4 %) and cite OGK8WLL69/T7HLAX8QN for the Fed pivot and 22PL3Q360 for auto‑sector margins; (3) explicitly show how Fed cuts compress real rates (e.g., real 10Y falling from 1.5 % to 0.5 %) and how that weakens the dollar (USD index down 1–2 %)—cite OGK8WLL69/T7HLAX8QN; (4) quantify the crypto lift (Ether 4,000–4,500 $) and link it to SEC Project Crypto and the Trump order—add a citation for the SEC source; (5) for oil, give a tight price band (Brent 60–65 $ / bbl, WTI 58–62 $ / bbl) and note the supply‑demand gap (J99EM2TPZ/T1QE6JPIX); (6) for EURUSD, state a range (1.07–1.10) and tie it to the seven‑year software cycle and Gemini‑AI CAPEX—cite 5S9GJV2O3/HWGNUP2XG/UVEQ2SJ0W; (7) replace generic “will remain resilient” with a conditional statement (e.g., “EURUSD holds if tech CAPEX stays above 5 % of GDP”); (8) add a risk‑premia section that explains how equity valuations may widen the risk premium if Fed cuts stall; (9) create a watch‑list table with dates: Jackson Hole minutes (Oct 15), Q2 auto earnings (Nov 1), OPEC+ supply announcement (Dec 5), EU‑US trade talks (Jan 20); (10) reconcile any conflicting sources (e.g., if 22PL3Q360 shows a 2.5 % CAGR but another source shows 3.0 %) by noting the assumption behind each estimate. Finally, keep the whole piece under 600 words, use one‑sentence bullet points for each driver, and ensure every claim has a source ID. This will elevate the analysis to a concise, data‑driven, and actionable market view.",
