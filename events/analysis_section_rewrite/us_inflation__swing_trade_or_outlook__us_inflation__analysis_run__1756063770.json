      "feedback": "This draft shows strong structure and a credible regime framework, plus a concrete Ford proxy, but it fails to meet the four-line Movers requirement and the discipline needed for world-class swing analysis. Actionable edits: (1) Replace the Movers & Scenarios with exactly four lines, two Up and two Down, each in the exact format: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. Tie each line to explicit, source-backed catalysts (e.g., AI capex momentum from NL5YYTLF2/SGB2PAZGK; Ford EV losses and ROIC from 22PL3Q360; Ford’s 17% YTD gain and ~5% dividend from 22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW) and anchor probabilities to the four-regime map (Regime A ~50%, B ~30%, C ~20%; use those anchors to assign 0–100 probabilities). Do not include any nonconforming lines (e.g., the Long line) or extraneous narrative in Movers. (2) For the Up lines, emphasize: (a) 0–3 weeks: AI-enabled productivity lift driving capex reallocation; (b) 3–6 months: tariff relief or policy pivot enabling faster AI capex momentum; for Down lines emphasize: (a) 0–3 weeks: tariff escalation/inflation risk pressuring autos; (b) 3–6 months: energy-price shock or regime shift toward tighter external balances. Attach explicit, validated triggers and invalidation points with IDs (no uncited claims). (3) Eliminate the mixed macro paragraphs and the “Long” line; compress to a tight four-line Movers section plus a 1–2 line Trade/Outlook Plan if Ford (or the auto complex) remains tradable. In the Outlook, if tradable, present a Swing Trade line with Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability | Confidence; if you cannot supply precise levels, flag placeholders and lock them after confirming a catalyst and level-relative rules. (4) Strengthen first-principles grounding by compressing the causal chain into four crisp steps: AI capex lifts productivity; policy/tariff stance re-prices risk premia and external balances; capital reallocation toward AI/datacenters and semis; asset prices adjust via regime-dependent multipliers. (5) Tighten numerical discipline: quote key numbers (Ford EV losses ≈$1.3B; ROIC ≈10%; Ford YTD +17%; dividend ~5%; forward P/E bands) and map each to an ID, so every assertion is traceable. (6) Reconcile conflicts by selecting a single dominant regime narrative for the horizon and show how each mover’s probability and triggers would shift if that regime moves (include explicit invalidation thresholds). (7) Trim the watchlist to 3–5 critical triggers; ensure every trigger maps to a concrete regime shift or catalyst with an explicit time window. (8) Deliver a clean, self-contained set of four Movers, a concise 1–2 line Outlook, and a minimal but fully-referenced plan that reads as a testable trading thesis, with inline IDs after facts and no trailing citation lists. This will lift the piece to world-class status: crisp, testable, fully sourced, and aligned with the four-regime framework and the required formatting.",
