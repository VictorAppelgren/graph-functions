  "description": "Former CEO Meg Ryan, who was fired in June for-cause after the hospital\u2019s new leadership accused Ryan of stealing at least $1 million from the medical center through improper exit payouts.",
  "content": "Nassau University Medical Center is suing its former CEO for $10 million in damages, accusing her of widespread misconduct that includes self-enrichment, policy violations, destruction of records, and waste of public funds.\n\nFormer CEO Meg Ryan, who was fired in June for-cause after the hospital\u2019s new leadership \u2014 appointed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after a heated state takeover that same month \u2014 accused Ryan of stealing at least $1 million from the medical center through improper exit payouts.\n\nThe new bombshell lawsuit now accuses Ryan of abusing her position to enrich herself and other top administrators by seeking reimbursement for luxury expenses and fake trips, destroying hospital records, orchestrating a mass resignation of senior leadership, and pursuing meritless lawsuits against New York State.\n\n\u201cOur goal with this complaint is to be fully transparent about what occurred and to take decisive steps toward a stronger future,\u201d Stuart Rabinowitz, Chair of NUMC\u2019s Board of Directors, said in a press release announcing the lawsuit Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe taxpayers, patients, and employees who depend on this hospital deserve a clear accounting of how resources were used, and we have a duty to safeguard our mission, protect our ability to deliver care, and ensure NUMC remains a pillar for this community,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Ryan\u2019s camp told The Post the lawsuit is simply another distraction from the state\u2019s alleged fraud, which she claims to be a whistleblower of.\n\n\u201cThis frivolous suit was clearly developed in retaliation for Ms. Ryan\u2019s discovery of the State\u2019s massive Medicaid fraud scheme,\u201d a spokesperson for Meg Ryan told The Post.\n\n\u201c[It was] filed as a smokescreen to distract from the Hochul-appointed board\u2019s actions to drop the lawsuits against the State, and the new leadership\u2019s recent approvals of $10 million in no-bid contracts \u2013 including to a firm run by the Nassau Democratic Party\u2019s Vice Chairman \u2013 as well as repeated violations of the State\u2019s transparency, procurement and public officers laws,\u201d he added.\n\nRyan\u2019s spokesperson further blasted Rabinowitz and the board as \u201cunethical,\u201d accusing them of knowingly misrepresenting the payments to departing staff, and said they were for time earned in line with Nassau Health Care Corporation policy and precedent.\n\nThe spokesperson claimed the new leadership \u2014 described as political appointees installed to cover up \u201cthe State\u2019s massive fraud\u201d \u2014 is attempting to shift attention away from the state\u2019s alleged wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIf the political hacks who have been put in charge of NHCC to cover up the State\u2019s massive fraud want a fight \u2014 they\u2019ll get one \u2014 We have the evidence, the witnesses and the facts to ensure Ms. Ryan will be vindicated on all fronts,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the state said bring it on \u2014 calling Ryan\u2019s tenure a prime example of failed leadership.\n\n\u201cThe breathtaking level of waste, abuse, and mismanagement under NUMC\u2019s previous leadership is an insult to taxpayers and a betrayal of the hospital\u2019s mission,\u201d Gov. Hochul\u2019s Long Island Spokesperson Gordon Tepper told The Post.\n\n\u201cThe recent revelations further validate Governor Hochul\u2019s decisive action to restructure the board and restore accountability to this critical safety-net institution,\u201d he added, referencing the recent news of an expensive dinner charged to the hospital the night before the previous board was fired.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

Kathy Hochul\u2019s \u201chostile takeover\u201d of the Long Island hospital.\nMeg Ryan, the former president of the Nassau Health Care Corporation, was given the boot by Hochul and her cronies in an \u201cillicit scheme\u201d to have NUMC foot the bill for Medicaid payments that the state was on the hook for, she claimed in a statement to The Post.\nRyan is alleging breach of contract and seeking damages after Hochul appointed her allies Richard Becker, Stuart Rabinowitz, Richard Kessel and others to oversee the hospital, according to a notice of claim her lawyers filed in state court Wednesday.\n\u201cThey weaponized the Department of Health and the state budget process to take over our community hospital and then leaked misinformation to the press to damage me personally,\u201d Ryan fumed. \u201cIt is unconscionable.\n\u201cI am eager to have my day in court and fight not only to clear my name but further expose the state\u2019s corruption.\u201d\nBecker, Rabinowitz and Kessel and 10 unidentified members of the NHCC \u201cacted deliberately and with malice\u201d by denying her severance and salary payments starting June 1 after the state government had assumed control of the NUMC, Ryan\u2019s attorney Alex Hartzband wrote in the claim.\nThe board of directors, which later resigned, is weighing a vote to terminate Ryan\u2019s employment for \u201ccause,\u201d with Becker claiming she made \u201cexcessive termination payments\u201d to herself and the other NHCC employees after announcing she would resign.\nHer resignation letter was rejected by Becker, who promptly fired her in a late June letter that was reported by Newsday shortly after.\nRyan claims that Becker exceeded his authority in firing her.\n\u201cDuring my time as President and CEO of NHCC, we expanded services, improved quality of care, and reduced expenses. We demonstrated that, if not for the State\u2019s malfeasance, the hospital was financially viable,\u201d Ryan said.\n\u201cMy top priority has always been giving people the best possible health care and protecting our dedicated employees.\u201d\nAttorneys for Ryan are prepared to argue in a forthcoming lawsuit that the payments were permissible and accrued from unused paid time off.\nThey also allege she\u2019s being targeted for leading an earlier lawsuit against NHCC last December that sought to recoup more than $1 billion in Medicaid funding allegedly withheld from the public hospital the corporation oversees, NUMC, over two decades.\nHouse Republicans last week launched an investigation into the purported \u201cfiscal coverup\u201d by Hochul done to boost a billion-dollar budget deficit that \u201chas forced local governments to increase property taxes and cut local services.\u201d\nIn May, Hochul had approved a budget bill with a provision that imposed state control of the NHCC\u2019s board with Becker, Rabinowitz and Kessel and other state appointees.\nKessel had previously been appointed by Hochul to serve as director and chair of the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority.\nRabinowitz was previously appointed to the State Gaming Facility Location Board and once served as president of Hofstra University.\nBecker served as deputy secretary for health and human services under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nNHCC has since let go of attorneys representing it in the Medicaid lawsuit against the state and filed for an adjournment.\nUntil Ryan and other executives uncovered it, NUMC, the only public hospital in the county with around 80% of its 275,000 patients uninsured, had been forced to pay the state\u2019s percentage of Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) funding, the December lawsuit alleged.\n\u201cMs. Ryan did absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d Hartzband told The Post. \u201cThe payments she authorized were permissible under hospital policy and consistent with years of established practice by the CEOs who preceded her.\u201d\nHe also accused the new NHCC leadership of fomenting a \u201cshameless media campaign\u201d to defame her.\n\u201cAs we have repeatedly said, the Governor\u2019s priorities at NUMC have always been patient care and ensuring the hospital\u2019s long-term financial stability,\u201d Hochul press secretary Gordon Tepper said in a statement.\n\u201cThe newly restructured board has been empowered to take the steps necessary to protect these priorities and to safeguard the future of this essential community hospital.\u201d\nThe Post reached out to NHCC for comment."

Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."

I\u2019m not getting out of this car. It\u2019s time to go to bed,\u201d he shouts at the officer, before being forcibly removed and booked into the jail shortly before 1 a.m., according to an arrest report retrieved by WCBD.\nMcLeod\u2019s eyes were \u201cextremely bloodshot and highly dilated \u2026 typical of an individual under the influence of a stimulant narcotic,\u201d according to the report.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether McLeod \u2014 who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010 and served two terms as Charleston County Democratic Party chairman \u2014 was tested for drugs during his arrest.\nHe is facing misdemeanor charges for disorderly conduct.\nHis party leadership is calling on him to step down from the gubernatorial race, in which he is currently the party\u2019s only candidate.\n\u201cAfter reviewing the transcript of the dash cam footage from his recent arrest, it is clear that Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor,\u201d the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, said in a statement Wednesday.\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\n\u201cWe offer him compassion and pray he finds the support he needs.\u201d\nMcLeod\u2019s campaign team did not respond immediately to requests for comment, but he branded his arrest \u201cunlawful\u201d in a recent interview announcing his candidacy.\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019d ask the voters is to please give me a little bit of grace and know that long before we go to Election Day, they\u2019ll know exactly what happened,\u201d he told the Post and Courier.\n\u201cAnd when they learn what happened around my unlawful arrest, it will be a reason why I absolutely need to be our state\u2019s governor,\u201d he said, adding that he had been exercising his \u201cGod-given, constitutional right to be in a public place\u201d when he was arrested."

      "text": "NUMC execs charged steak, lobster to debt-ridden hospital night before state takeover: report\nThe night before the state took control of Nassau University Medical Center, its top executives billed a nearly $1,500 dinner at a Manhattan steakhouse to the debt-ridden hospital, a new report revealed.\nThe May 29 outing at the Lobster Club in Midtown came just hours before Gov. Kathy Hochul was set to appoint new leadership to the financially struggling hospital, which is over $1 billion in debt, according to reimbursement records obtained by Newsday.\nSeven executives including former CEO Meg Ryan attended the dinner, which the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority \u2014 the agency responsible for monitoring and overseeing the county\u2019s spending \u2014 called \u201can absolute outrage.\u201d\n\u201cOn their last day, they went to the city and celebrated with a lobster dinner and other activities and spent hospital money,\u201d authority chairman Richard Kessel, who was appointed by Hochul in 2023, told Newsday.\n\u201cThis is a hospital with deep financial challenges \u2014 that\u2019s got very low cash \u2014 and these guys were supposedly working for the betterment of the hospital and the taxpayers?\u201d\nThe execs hit the restaurant after attending the Greater New York Hospital Association Annual Meeting, and receipts show the group\u2019s meal included a $175 lobster, $68 Wagyu skirt steak and mounds of sushi at the high-end Midtown restaurant.\nUnder NUMC\u2019s expense policy, employees are expected to stay within limits of $20 for breakfast, $30 for lunch, $50 for dinner and request government rates for travel \u2014 unless specifically approved in advance by the CEO or CFO.\nMany of the expenses submitted by the former leadership appear to exceed those limits, according to the hospital\u2019s finance records.\nIn the months leading up to the state takeover, Ryan and her executive team expensed thousands on travel to Albany, Washington, DC, and Chicago, the records show.\nThat includes a nearly $3,000, three-night stay at the Willard InterContinental in DC, a $1,000 hotel bill in Albany, and almost $8,000 for three round-trip flights to a Chicago health care conference.\nTom Basile, a spokesperson for Ryan, told The Post the former CEO only stopped by the dinner briefly, but didn\u2019t eat any food, and wasn\u2019t the person who organized the event or submitted the reimbursement.\nHe also said that Ryan frequently was reimbursed for meetings with government officials and events where she was mainly invited to speak \u2014 even fronting the costs of round-trip tickets for her and another administrator personally for a trip that was ultimately canceled at the last minute.\n\u201cAny suggestion that she did anything improper or was reimbursed inappropriately is just another effort to distract from the State\u2019s Medicaid corruption, now under investigation by Congress, the millions in illegal no-bid contracts approved by Hochul\u2019s new appointees and NHCC\u2019s violation of Ms. Ryan\u2019s employment contract,\u201d Basile said.\nBasile added that the majority of Ryan\u2019s expenses during her tenure were \u201cfor the purpose of lobbying for additional resources\u201d and \u201cto advocate for the restoration of the $1 billion in funding illegally withheld by the State government as part of its ongoing Medicaid scheme.\u201d\nHe pointed out that while the state and new hospital leadership cry foul at Ryan\u2019s previous expenses and salary of $550,000, the new CEO, Richard Becker, makes over $760,000 per year, which was confirmed by authority documents.\n\u201cUnlike previous CEOs, who racked up hundreds of thousands in inappropriate expenses, Ms. Ryan, during her short tenure, personally paid thousands of dollars for initiatives that were not reimbursed, including food for employees, transportation, and supplies for community events,\u201d Basile said.\nRyan was officially terminated \u201cfor cause\u201d the day after the dinner, with officials alleging Ryan improperly authorized $3.5 million in separation payouts to herself and a dozen other executives before stepping down \u2014 a claim Ryan denies.\nShe has since filed a lawsuit against the hospital challenging the termination and disputing the allegations.\nThe spending is under review as part of an ongoing audit ordered by the hospital\u2019s new leadership."
