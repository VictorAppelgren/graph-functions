  "content": "Is An E-Ink Display The Productivity Hack You Think It Is?\n\nE-Ink, short for electronic ink, has been out there in the consumer electronics segment for a while now. But over the past couple of years, there has been a dramatic perception change. The technology has not only matured (going from black and white monochrome panels to color panels), but it is now also available on a wider range of devices, from tablets and note-taking slates to phones, monitors, and smartwatches. But more than the evolution of the tech stack, the audience has also started warming up to the tech for some non-obvious reasons, as well. Of course, they're easier on the eyes and cut down on the blue-light exposure, which supposedly helps with sleep rhythms. Plus, E-Ink screens are far less taxing on the battery. The paper-like surface texture on the E-Ink Color panels is also a lot less reflective, so there's no glare problem to encounter. The most obvious benefit, however, is how they help you cut down on the distracting digital noise and keep you focused on the work at hand. Over the past couple of years, I have experimented with a pocketable tablet featuring a color E-Ink panel, alongside a large note-taking tablet, a phone, and a phone-like Android-powered reader, all packing a monochrome black and white screen. After using all these E-Ink devices and learning to live with their obvious shortcomings, I came to the realization that these devices actually proved to be agents of enhanced productivity in their respective segments. On a few occasions, they actually surpassed their counterparts in meaningful ways.\n\nThe benefits far outweigh the compromises One of the first E-Ink devices that I tried was the Boox Palma (and a few other devices of its ilk). It's a phone-shaped device that runs Android and goes for the spot that is usually reserved for the Kindle. The build quality of this device is astounding, but beyond that, it offers a deep level of control over how you interact with the display. From animation speed and screen refresh rate to contrast levels and text representation, the Palma offers an unprecedented level of control over the reading experience, something you won't find on any Kindle out there. The most promising element is that it runs the full Android experience, which means you can download any app and access tools that you would like to access without making any functional sacrifices. When needed, you can access a full-featured web browser like Chrome (with all your saved data and credentials) as well as workplace communication apps such as Slack and Teams. It's like a full-fledged Android phone disguised as an e-reader device, with a fittingly minimalist screen tailor-made for binge-reading sessions that lets you tap into work mode without any overtly complex technical hoops. And yeah, it's good enough for audiobooks and YouTube videos, too, assuming you have no qualms watching a video in black and white. I even indulged in the occasional Angry Birds sessions. At the end of the day, I was able to extract far more functional utility from this E-Ink device than an average e-reader with a monochrome panel.\n\nMy time with the Boox Palma gave me enough confidence to try the Mudita Kompakt, a minimalist phone with an E-Ink display that focuses on reducing the digital dopamine sources in your day-to-day smartphone usage. There is no app store on this phone, and it focuses on an ad-free, tracking-free environment. There's even a dedicated button that kills access to the mic, WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular network. There are only basic apps installed on the device, though you can sideload crucial apps such as WhatsApp by sideloading it via the Mudita Center dashboard. Despite my skepticism, using the device for just a couple of weeks helped cut down on the time wasted on scrolling social media sites. Moreover, the E-Ink panel made sure that even when I relapsed and opened web versions of distracting sites like Reddit meme pages or Instagram, the black-and-white panel instantly made it appear a lot less engaging than it would on a rich OLED screen. With lower screen time and the frugal power draw of the E-Ink panel, this pleasantly compact phone can last two full days with ease, a huge respite from the battery anxiety that I was suffering with the iPhone. Switching over to an E-Ink slate, such as the Boox Tab X, wasn't any different from the Palma. I was able to perform better at the research and writing part of my job with extra focus. Overall, E-Ink devices have helped boost my productivity, and I would take that any given day over the few functional hiccups posed by a black-and-white display.",

      "text": "Huawei MatePad Paper Is An E Ink Tablet To Eclipse Kindle\nIf you've ever wanted a notebook that can magically erase your notes or transform your scribbles into a proper email, you're in luck \u2014 Huawei has got just the thing for you. The company has announced the upcoming release of the Huawei MatePad Paper, an E Ink tablet that combines the capabilities of an Amazon Kindle with a good old-fashioned notebook \u2014 with a lot of extras. Although the tablet, being an E Ink device, can only display content in black and white, it seems to pack a bunch of features to make up for the lack of color.\nOn the outside, the Huawei MatePad Paper looks much like any other tablet. It's a 10.3-inch device with a 86% screen-to-body ratio. Huawei doesn't reveal the resolution of the tablet, but it's shown to be large enough to offer a comfortable split-screen experience. This should make it easy to, for example, read something and simultaneously take notes using the stylus bundled with the tablet.\nHuawei is marketing the MatePad Paper as a device for both reading e-books and productivity, but it definitely emphasizes the lifelike experience of using the Huawei M-Pencil stylus on the MatePad Paper. The device comes with 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and offers low latency (just 26ms), making it easy to replicate real-time handwriting. Huawei also offers audio recording that works seamlessly with taking notes, allowing users to leave marks on the audio to remember the most important parts. Those clips can be re-played by simply tapping the mark.\nBattery life beyond ordinary tablets\nHandwritten notes can be converted to text and shared, and judging by Huawei's preview, your notes will be translated accurately even if you don't have the neatest handwriting. As the device comes with a fingerprint reader, confidential notes can be locked and encrypted. Such notes will only be unlocked when you tap the fingerprint sensor. The Huawei MatePad Paper also offers an innovative, perhaps handy feature \u2014 your documents can be translated from another language directly by the device. Of course, we don't know how accurate such translations are going to be, and your mileage may vary.\nSpeaking of mileage, Huawei promises that the tablet will have a fantastic battery life, lasting up to 4 weeks in standby mode on a single charge. This translates to about 6 days of reading before needing to recharge. The screen has an anti-glare solution and the device offers 32 levels of brightness, so you can most probably read in full sunlight as well as at night. Huawei MatePad Paper supports Wi-Fi 6+ and can be paired with other devices to seamlessly transfer files.\nBridging the gap between tablets and ereaders\nEquipped with 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage, the MatePad Paper remains a mystery in terms of other specifications. We do know it's going to be very easy to carry, weighing just around 0.8lbs, and that it will feature Huawei's own operating system \u2014 HarmonyOS. Huawei is no longer able to use Android, so it had to come up with its own alternative, and HarmonyOS is the result. Of course, this means you won't be able to use Google Play apps on the new MatePad Paper. We're not sure how this might affect user access to various e-book libraries, but Huawei promises a robust selection of books to read including over 2 million titles in the Huawei Books app.\nThe company hasn't announced the exact availability or release date of this device just yet. However, we know that it will be priced at 499 euros in Europe. That makes it much pricier than the Amazon Kindle, however, it does come with a host of features that help it stand out from the crowd. For those in need of a lightweight tablet for productivity and reading, the Huawei MatePad Pro might just be the most appealing E Ink tablet we've seen in a while."

      "text": "Onyx Boox Tab X Review: A4 E-Ink E-Reader With Notetaking Chops\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nOver the past decade, e-ink tablets have made some drastic jumps in quality and usability. While Amazon's Kindle has dominated the field when it comes to E-ink tablet devices, there are plenty of alternatives now, and Onyx (or Onyx Boox, or just Boox, depending on your region) makes some of the best.\nThe latest e-ink tablet released by the brand is the Onyx Boox Tab X. This device runs a form of Android and works with a sizeable 13.3-inch display that is approximately the size of an A4 sheet of paper. This isn't one for those who want a smaller, book-sized e-ink experience. It's aimed at those that either want to read documents or just want a larger screen for reading.\nThis may well be the e-ink device you've always wanted \u2014 or never realized you could have. If you've only ever used an e-ink tablet for reading, or you've only used Amazon's earliest tries at making e-ink tablets into the e-reader-of-choice for the masses, now's the time to see what's new. This device was sent to me by Onyx Boox for the purpose of this review.\nHardware specifications\nThe Onyx Boox Tab X is a 13.3-inch e-ink tablet running on Android 11 with Onyx Boox's custom skin. The star of the show is the 13.3 e-ink Mobius Carta screen, which has a resolution of 1650 \u00d7 2200 dots, coming in at about 207PPI pixel density. The screen supports 16 shades of grey. It comes with the SNOW Field functionality, which means fewer artifacts when the screen is partially refreshed. You get dual-tone backlight, letting you mix cool and warm backlight\nInside you get an 8-core, 2GHz Qualcomm 662 chip powering the whole deal. Onyx Boox hasn't specified the name of the chip. You get 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. A 6,300 mAh battery powers it, and you get USB-C charging with OTG support enabled on the port. Other specifications are on par with what you would expect from an average modern Android tablet, including dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.\nIndustrial design\nOnyx Boox has always made neat-looking e-readers, and the Onyx Boox Tab X definitely sits at the top of the lineup. It is definitely big in size, given the A4 sizing ambitions the company has designed it with \u2014 but once you hold it in your hands, the Tab X is surprisingly wieldable. It has a uniform thickness of 6.8mm, barring the edges, which are rounded for better handling.\nIt weighs about 1.2 lbs (560g), but at the 13-inch size, it's a winner. The tablet is well-balanced, which is a crucial thing for a device of this size. I was expecting this tablet to be difficult to hold given the massive size, but it actually felt better to hold than the M1-powered iPad Pro 11-inch that I used to own.\nn e-reader is generally likely going to spend more time in your hands than a normal tablet would, and the quality of the materials and construction make this the best tablet I have ever held in my hands. You get a matte feel on the back, which smudges, but nearly not as easily as a glossy back would, and it is easy to wipe clean, too.\nIf I were to judge this only as a regular tablet, the chin bezel being larger than the rest would have perhaps made me dock a point or two. However, the chin actually lets you hold the tablet vertically without any anxiety about touching the display area, which makes it an acceptable choice.\nBook reading experience\nIn my usage, I found the screen to be very crisp, and it is undoubtedly the best e-ink display I've ever had the opportunity to use. The display itself has a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is slightly different from the A4 ratio of the whole tablet's footprint.\nThe reading experience on this tablet was excellent. The screen gives you five refresh modes. The HD mode is the crispest one, the Balanced mode is self-explanatory, the fast mode compromises on clarity for faster response, and the Ultrafast mode is the quickest of them all, suited for watching videos if that's something you want out of an e-ink tablet. The fifth one is the Regal mode, which promises minimal ghosting.\nYou can set the mode on a per-app basis, which is really nifty for an e-ink tablet. The cherry on top is the fantastic backlighting on this tablet. You get dual-tone backlighting, with the ability to mix and match warm light and cool light, which means you can set just the right color temperature for your reading.\nBasically, if you want a large-screen e-ink reading experience, the Onyx Boox Tab X nails it.\nGreat for notes, not for drawing\nNotetaking on the Onyx Boox Tab X is surprisingly good. The display panel has been reinforced with protective glass, which means that writing with your palm on the screen feels very solid. The screen is inductive and capacitive, which means that there's support for the normal multitouch, plus support for a passive stylus.\nSpeaking of which, the Pen2 stylus included with every Tab X is pretty great, too. It handles fine, is grippy, and the tip works well with the matte screen, giving you a very paper-like feel. The only issue I have with this setup is that while you get the Pen2 \u2014 which is capable of attaching magnetically to other Onyx Boox tablets \u2014 the Tab X doesn't have this functionality. This seems like a missed opportunity, given the size of this tablet, but I assume it was a compromise the company made to make the tablet easier to hold, with the rounded edges.\nMy notetaking experience was pretty solid, on the first-party app as well as Microsoft OneNote, which was the app I used for notes on my iPad previously. Onyx Boox Tab X is definitely right up there when it comes to notetaking. If you're thinking of drawing, however, this is not the setup you want to go for, because of the lack of color and pressure sensitivity, among other things.\nSoftware experience\nHardware can only get you so far. When it comes to products like these, the software experience is just as important. Onyx Boox has loaded up the Tab X with Android 11, which is a couple of iterations behind the latest Android version \u2014 but in my opinion, this doesn't really play into the experience all that much.\nEditors note: This e-ink tablet does not display color beyond blacks and grays, but if the user captures screenshots and exports them from the tablet, they appear in (partial) color.\nThis is more of an e-reader that happens to run Android 11, instead of being an Android tablet with an e-ink screen. The Tab X can run all the notetaking and reading apps you want, straight from the Google Play Store. I tried out the Kindle app for obvious reasons, and it worked well. However, the average user likely won't quite feel the need to download any app at all, especially for the basic functionality you expect from this device.\nOnyx Boox's software suite is pretty solid. The Boox Neo Reader app, which is the default reading app for this device, has all the functionality you're expecting from an e-reader. It opened the files I threw at it without any issues. The notes app is also pretty sweet to use, and unless you have a reliance on a notes app already, you'll do just fine with it. Onyx Boox also gives a 5GB cloud backup plan similar to Apple's iCloud, bundled with the device.\nOnyx Boox's skin on top of Android 11 doesn't leave much to be desired. My personal favorite feature is the App Optimization button that lets you select the display resolution on a per-app basis, for non-system apps. This was particularly helpful in optimizing my experience with respect to battery life.\nPerformance and Battery life\nThe Onyx Boox Tab X is an e-reader first, but it does work rather well as an Android tablet too. The screen makes it a specialized device, but it can also be a bit limiting. For example, you cannot possibly think of the Tab X as something you can do high-FPS gaming on, because the screen isn't just designed to handle that, which is fine. You can, however, get by playing something like \"Clash of Clans,\" which was fantastic with the Fast mode.\nWatching videos with Fast mode resulted in acceptable motion performance and relatively low ghosting. However, this screen really isn't designed for moving media, so don't expect it to work the same way a normal LCD/OLED screen tablet does.\nThe speakers on this tablet are also very nice. You get a stereo pair, but there are no volume rockers on this tablet. That means you have to pull the notification shade to adjust the volume. That also means taking screenshots is a pain.\nBattery life in the Onyx Boox Tab X is fantastic. It is obvious that there are a lot of power-saving mechanisms at work here. For example, when the tablet goes to standby mode, Wi-Fi is automatically disconnected, resulting in a much lower draw on resources when you're not actively using the device. This is a forte of e-ink tablets, and Onyx Boox has kept the software light enough to keep battery life shockingly extensive.\nI haven't found myself reaching for the charger once in my 25 days with this Tab X. Even with heavy use, this tablet will return a rock-solid battery life given the 6300 mAh battery. There is no charger bundled in the box, but the USB-C port will take your standard PD charger, making for a hassle-free charging experience.\nConclusion: Should you buy the Onyx Boox Tab X?\nThe Onyx Boox Tab X is certainly a formidable offering, and it doesn't have much to compete against. The Kindle Scribe comes close, but it is a 10-inch tablet, and Onyx has its own Onyx Boox Note Air 2 Plus that's made to match. A notable direct competitor is the Fujitsu Quaderno A4 2nd Gen, which comes in at $779.99, but doesn't have the versatility of the Onyx Boox Tab X.\nPriced at $879.99, the Onyx Boox Tab X is aimed at a very specific customer. It is for folks that want a non-distracting reading and notetaking experience, and are willing to pay the price. There is plenty of appeal in getting a really good reading and writing experience, and the Tab X provides it. The price tag isn't for everyone, but it is an acceptable one given the lack of large e-ink devices. Since the device comes with Android 11, with Google Play Store already working out-of-the-box, you can start off with your own apps.\nIf you're looking at a tablet and an e-ink display isn't your priority, you'll likely find a winner in our most recent Best Tablets list instead.\nThe Onyx Boox Tab X is available on Amazon and the Onyx Boox Store. The box contains the Pen2 stylus thrown in, and there's a pretty great-looking magnetic three-fold case that Onyx Boox will bundle with the tablet if you buy it from its own store."

      "text": "5 Alternatives To The Phone-Sized Boox Palma E-Reader\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nOver the years, the electronic ink (e-ink) reader segment has exploded far beyond the Kindle stronghold. Some brands even went beyond the monochrome panels and introduced color e-ink readers, while others experimented beyond the traditional dairy format. Among those brands is Onyx Boox, and the most standout device in its portfolio is easily the Boox Palma.\nThink of it as an e-reader, but one that is as pocketable as a phone, but with the added flexibility of Android. I've had the Palma ever since its launch, and have used it more extensively than any Kindle. The biggest benefit, of course, is the palm-friendly build and the lightweight profile. It even has a camera for scanning documents.\nAnother standout aspect of the Palma is the thoughtful UX work. There are far more display customization options than with a Kindle, from contrast and refresh rate levels to color temperature and light filter strength. Moreover, the pre-installed Neo Reader offers even deeper customization, and it is one of the most fleshed-out applications of its kind, especially for devices aimed at reading enthusiasts. It is, however, not without its flaws. The build is not what you would call premium by conventional definitions. Moreover, it doesn't offer cellular connectivity support. Some might even argue that a price tag close to $300 is a bit high for a device that is essentially a pocket-sized e-reader in a phone's garb.\nIf you're looking for alternatives, here are some of the best.\nMoaan inkPalm 5\nIf you are enticed by the idea of a pocket-sized reading device, but wish the Boox Palma was a bit smaller, the Moaan inkPalm E-Reader is the right device for you. It offers a 5.2-inch HD glare-free screen, tagging alongside the convenience of temperature and brightness adjustment.\nYou get to choose from 32 levels of display calibration presets and 32GB of onboard storage, going from bright white for daylight reading to a soft warm tone that is suited for night-time reading. Tipping the scales at just about 0.25 pound, the Mooan inkPalm 5 is one of the smallest e-readers out there. It offers a physical home and function key array, which is always good news, especially for fundamental tasks like page turning.\nThe underlying software is based on Android, which means you can load any app of your choice. The only hurdle is that the Moaan inkPalm doesn't support Google Play Services out of the box. But if you are okay with the lack of Google tools available on a typical Android-based device, there are plenty of user posts on Reddit about installing launchers and getting a more flexible UI situation with sideloaded software.\nThere's a 1,400mAh battery fitted inside the Moaan inkPalm 5, and it comes with a choice of dark grey and green colors. In case you want more storage, a Pro version is also available with 64GB of onboard memory. The Amazon availability is rather hit or miss, but you can import it from AliExpress around the year.\nBigme HiBreak\nA device that looks and feels every bit like a phone, should ideally act as a phone. If you've ever wished the Boox Palma could take in a SIM card and allow cellular connectivity for calling and internet access, the Bigme HiBreak e-ink smartphone could just be what you are looking for. It's priced lower than the Boox Palma, so there's that advantage. Looks aren't standout here, thanks in no part to those thick bezels, but there's a cool trick. Instead of the black-and-white panel on the Boox device, you get a color e-ink panel on the Bigme phone.\nUp front is a 5.84-inch display with automatic anti-ghosting tech for a smooth visual experience. Bigme says it developed an in-house rapid refresh rate system to ensure that UI interactions are fluid, unlike the slow and ghosting-ridden interface of many e-ink devices out there.\nThe front light offers a 36-level adjustment facility, alongside dedicated one-click presets for sunlit and, night-time reading modes, among others. Android 11 handles things on the software side, with full Google Play Services access. There's a 13-megapixel camera at the back, while a 3,300mA battery keeps the lights on. An octa-core keeps things the Bigme phone ticking, working in tandem with a generous 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard expansion. In case you need more space, you can also pop in a microSD card of up to 1TB capacity.\nHisense A9 Pro\nHisense is a fairly well-known name in the consumer electronics segment, but the brand has been hawking palm-friendly e-ink devices long before the Boox Palma started making waves. The company makes e-readers, music players, and even music readers armed with an e-ink panel, in color as well as monochrome flavors. One of the best e-ink devices in the brand's portfolio is the A9 Pro, a full-fledged smartphone.\nA fairly sleek device that only measures 7.8mm across, the Hisense phone offers a 6.1-inch e-ink Carta 1200 screen (824 x 1646 pixels) front-lit display with a temperature adjustment facility in tow. Users can pick between 27 levels of viewing presets as they shift between white and amber color tones. This one draws power from Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 662 silicon, which is paired with 8GB of RAM ( the highest in a device of its kind) and 256GB of onboard storage.\nThe Hisense A9 Pro also offers a 13-megapixel HD camera at the back and offers a bigger 4,000 mAh battery, as well. It even throws a fingerprint scanner into the mix, and allows dual-SIM functionality. Notably, it's a hybrid slot, which means one of the SIM cards can be swapped out with a microSD card for storage expansion. However, keep in mind that cellular connectivity is limited to 4G (LTE) on this one. In case you need 5G, you can check out the Hisense A7 e-ink smartphone.\nWoxter Scribe 195 S\nWhen it comes to e-readers, there is a legion of fans who swear by physical controls. A button for something as basic as turning the pages is a highly desirable trait. What if you get the whole set of navigation buttons and menu controls dished out as physical buttons on the bottom lip, just like the Kindles from over a decade ago? If that sounds appealing, the Woxter Scriba 195 S will serve you well. It is also the cutest e-reader out there, especially in cherry red.\nThis one offers a 4.7-inch e-ink display with 16 levels of grayscale adjustment. The resolution figures are not exactly astounding at 960 x 540 pixels, but for reading books, the panel is still plenty sharp. The company assures that even under direct sun, users won't run into glare or fatigue issues. You only get 4GB of storage and a small 800 mAh battery. Needless to say, this is a device with retro design appeal that is intended strictly for reading books, and not much else.\nThink of it as a modern revival of vintage Nintendo consoles, which are now all the rage in the form of gadgets like the Analohgue Pocket. Woxter claims that the Scrib 195 S is the lightest e-book reader out there. The biggest challenge here is getting a hold of the device, even after you've set aside the cash. You either have to get it shipped from the Woxter website, set up an Amazon availability alert, or rely on third-party sellers like Good E-Reader and Ubuy, and pay a premium.\nRCL NXTPAPER 50 5G\nArguably the most interesting option on the list, but one with a few clear distinctions. Do you absolutely need a paper-like display? The TCL NXTPAPER 50 5G will offer just that, in both color and black/white formats. But the underlying tech is not e-ink, so there's that. This is a phone first, but with a unique matte finish screen that imitates the look as well as the feel of paper.\nThe best part about the NXTPAPER tech is that, unlike the sluggish e-ink screens, this panel offers a 120Hz refresh rate, technically matching the display fluidity of top-tier devices like the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPad Pro. The bezels are the slimmest of all the devices listed above, and you get 6.8 inches of screen real estate with anti-glare, low-blue light certifications as additional perks.\nThere's a dedicated physical NXTPAPER slider on the right edge that switches between full-color and monochrome display modes. It even lets you switch between dedicated ink paper (similar to an e-book reader interface) and color paper (for comic and magazine reading) viewing formats. The rest of the package is also the most powerful out of the bunch.\nThe triple rear camera array is led by a 108-megapixel snapper, while an 8-megapixel camera handles selfies and video calls. It runs Android 14 (commitment up to Android 16), while the processing duties are handled by MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 SoC, running the show alongside 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage, which is expandable up to 2TB via a microSD card slot."
