  "title": "What Makes The Lenovo Rollable Laptop So Unique?",
  "description": "Lenovo's Rollable laptop has a 14-inch display that extends to a 16.5-inch one with the press of a button, increasing the resolution from 2000x1600 to 2000x2350",
  "content": "What Makes The Lenovo Rollable Laptop So Unique?\n\nAt first glance, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 laptop looks similar to many other 14-inch models. However, this machine hides a unique feature that could be a game-changer for some users. Of course, this is hardly the brand's first foray into unique display technology. The Lenovo Yoga Book 9I Gen 9 had a unique dual-touchscreen setup. However, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 comes equipped with a flexible OLED display, which literally unrolls from a 5:4 aspect ratio to an 8:9 ratio, going from 14 inches to 16.7 inches with the push of a button. This enhances the amount of screen space by nearly 50%, allowing you to either utilize one large display or a split-screen configuration. Lenovo claims that users can bolster their productivity levels with the split-screen mode using ThinkBook Workspace. This proprietary software tool gives you the ability to incorporate handy widgets and business apps in the lower screen space, improving workflow efficiency.\n\nIt's not too bulky or heavy and remains stable even with the screen extended Considering the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 must conceal additional components, such as the motors that allow the display to expand, you might think it must be quite sizeable. It's definitely innovative in its display design, but a large form factor would make it less convenient for the traveling professional. While it certainly won't be among the thinnest and sleekest laptops available, it only measures less than an inch (a total of .78-inches) when closed. Moreover, the machine only weighs 3.72 pounds, despite having an extended monitor. A stand-alone compact monitor with a display under 24 inches may tip the scales between five and 10 pounds. Another concern beyond dimensions is whether the laptop would easily tip over when the display is fully extended. It remains balanced because the screen hinges won't enable you to angle the display beyond around 110 degrees. In order to utilize the rolling feature, this Lenovo must be open at least 90 degrees, and if you press the button to retract the screen and then attempt to close the laptop, the motors will stop until you tilt it back open.\n\nThis design does come with a few drawbacks The Plus Gen 6 isn't the only option in terms of laptops with the most interesting features, but certain industry professionals might find the extra real estate enticing. For example, those in finance who spend extended time working with spreadsheets and visual data may find scrolling much less cumbersome. However, this clever design isn't ideal for all applications. With its odd 2000 x 2350 resolution, it would be an awkward choice for something like gaming or streaming movies, which doesn't typically take advantage of the added screen space and will instead include black bars. Another issue with the Plus Gen 6 is that when using it with the screen completely rolled out, you may only get around five and a half hours of battery life. Meaning, this isn't a machine that you could use for a full work day without plugging it in at some point. Lastly, while it does incorporate premium components, such as Harman Kardon speakers, ample storage with a 1TB SSD, and power under the hood with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, it's pricey. The Plus Gen 6 starts at $3,299, which might be out of reach for some consumers.",

      "text": "The Top 4 Thin And Sleek Laptops For Ultimate Portability\nWhether you are a college student and need to carry your laptop to your courses or have a full-time job, gone are the days of slipping bulky laptops into your briefcase. Nowadays, one of the primary factors most people take into consideration when choosing a laptop is how lightweight and portable it is. The lighter and sleeker your laptop is, the easier it is to work on it, even when you're on the go. Apart from being easy to carry, it's essential to consider a few other things when choosing a laptop. Good battery life ensures you can work on the go, and durability means it will last despite constant movement and daily use. Fortunately, top manufacturers understand these needs and keep improving their products to fit the mobile lifestyle.\nHowever, with the hundreds of options available on the web, finding the perfect laptop that checks every box of your requirements can certainly be a challenge. This article discusses four of the lightest and thinnest laptops that promise convenience and performance. We're recommending each laptop based on SlashGear's hands-on experience using them and after taking user reviews and testimonials into account. I found myself in a similar situation a couple of months ago, and while I settled on the M2 MacBook Air, all the laptops that made it to our list were the top contenders.\nMacBook M2 Air\nMacBook Airs are undoubtedly one of the best laptops to opt for, especially if you're looking for a thin, lightweight one that's easy to carry around. The M2 MacBook Air is available in two different sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. The 13-inch MacBook has a 13.6-inch retina display, while the 15-inch model has a 15.3-inch liquid retina display. Both models feature a square-edge design with a rectangular notch at the top of the screen. The M2 MacBook Air lineup packs the Apple M2 chip, which has an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine.\nThe 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air feature displays with 500 nits of brightness and are both available in the same colors: Starlight, Midnight, Space Gray, and Silver. Both feature a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, and Apple boasts that both models can handle up to 15 hours of wireless web surfing and 18 hours of movie playback.\nWhile both laptops are similar in terms of specs, they differ in terms of price, weight, and thickness. The 13-inch model weighs 2.7 pounds and is 0.44 inches thin, while the 15-inch weighs 3.3 pounds and has a thickness of 0.45 inches. The base model of the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air currently retails for $1,099, while the 15-inch base model retails for $1,299.\nWhile MacBooks definitely lean towards the more expensive side, they are quite durable, and if treated right, they're built to last. The fanless M2 Air lineup is not only extremely thin and lightweight, but it also offers unmatched performance and battery life.\nDell XPS 13\nThe latest iteration of the Dell XPS 13 is another great option if you value portability and are looking for a MacBook alternative. This laptop is available in two different models \u2014 the standard Dell XPS 13 and the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. While the former is quite lightweight and portable and is almost half an inch thick and weighs 2.59 pounds, the latter has a thickness of 0.29 inches and weighs 1.60 pounds. Regardless of the model you opt for, you can easily slip either one into your briefcase or carry it around from place to place.\nBoth models pack a 12th Gen Intel Core i5 processor along with an Intel Iris Xe Graphics card, a combination that'll ensure you can multitask and work seamlessly. The Dell XPS 13 offers up to 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB of internal storage and is available in two different colors: Umber and Sky. The former is a deep purple color with a hint of brown, while the latter is an icy blue color. On the other hand, the convertible model offers up to 16 GB RAM and up to 1 TB of internal storage and is available in two different colors: Sky and Slate. Just like the regular Dell XPS 13, the former is an icy light blue shade, while the latter is a darker black color.\nSimilar to the M2 MacBook Air, both models can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. The regular Dell XPS 13 has a 13.4-inch Full FHD+ non-touch display, while the touchscreen model has a 13-inch display. The regular and 2-in-1 Dell XPS 13 model with Windows 11 Home, 16GB of RAM, and 512 GB of internal storage starts at $1,099.\nAsus ZenBook S 13 OLED\nIf you're on the lookout for a powerful laptop that can handle all your tasks even when you're on the go, the Asus ZenBook S 13 is another option we recommend. The Windows laptop is around 0.46 inches thick and weighs only 2.2 pounds. While many believe that thin Windows laptops ultimately mean that you'll have to deal with compromised quality and performance, the Asus ZenBook S 13 is definitely an exception.\nAs the name suggests, the laptop has a 13.3-inch OLED display and can reach up to 550 nits of brightness. It houses Intel's 13th Gen Core i7 chip and the Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics card. The 2023 edition is available in four different colors: Ponder Blue, Aqua Celadon, Vestige Beige, and Refined White. While many laptop manufacturers, including Apple, have decided to reduce the number of ports on the devices to ensure they're as slim as possible, the Asus ZenBook S13 offers a full-size HDMI port, two Thunderbolt four connections, a 3.5-millimeter audio jack, and USB 3.2 Type-A ports. The Asus laptop offers up to 32 GB of RAM and up to 1 TB of internal storage.\nSurface Pro 9\nIf you've been searching for a portable 2-in-1 laptop, there's no way the Microsoft Surface Pro lineup didn't cross your mind. The Microsoft Surface Pro 9 is the latest in the lineup, and its weight starts at 1.94 pounds and is 0.37 inches thick. Keep in mind that the mentioned weight is exclusive of the Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and Surface Slim Pen 2, which are both sold separately.\nAlthough Windows laptops generally have a bad reputation when it comes to battery life, Microsoft claims that the Surface Pro 9 with the 12th Intel Gen chip has up to 15.5 hours of battery life. This means that not only is the 2-in-1 laptop extremely lightweight, but you also won't have to carry your charger around with you.\nWhen building your device, you can either opt for the 12th Gen Intel Core i5, 12th Gen Intel Core i7, or, if you opt for the 5G model, the Microsoft SQ 3 processor. The laptop is available in four different colors: Platinium, Sapphire, Forest, and Graphite. Unfortunately, you'll have to compromise a bit on convenience since the Surface Pro 9 only has two Thunderbolt four ports and does not have a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.\nWhy these laptops made it to our list\nWhen I was looking for a new laptop, I wanted to get a device that was not only powerful but one that I could easily carry around with me. Since I'm deep into the Apple ecosystem, I settled on the M2 MacBook Air. During my search, I tested out different laptops, including the ones mentioned above. I prioritized the performance and made sure to check out what tech experts were saying about these laptops. In addition, some of these laptops were reviewed by the team at SlashGear to give readers an in-depth outlook of the pros and cons."

      "text": "Lenovo Yoga Book 9i Gen 9 Review (2024): One Notebook, Two Screens, No Waiting\nWhen one thinks of Lenovo, the first thought to come to mind is the ThinkPad series of business-grade laptops. However, the Chinese-American multinational tech company isn't just helping captains of industry keep up with the latest and greatest in computing. On the consumer side, Lenovo has the IdeaPad \u2014 the consumer version of the ThinkPad \u2014 the Legion line of gaming laptops, and the 2-in-1 Yoga. In 2018, the Yoga line introduced a dual-screen laptop in the form of the Yoga Book C930, where one screen was an LCD touch panel, the other an E-Ink unit where the keyboard lived.\nFast forward to 2023, the Yoga Book 9i was the next Yoga 2-in-1 to lose a permanent physical keyboard, this time for a pair of screens a la the Nintendo DS. There is only one other 2-in-1 like the 9i, that being the ASUS ZenBook Duo. Still, this is quite the departure from not only most other 2-in-1s but laptops in general; only the ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo comes close to these unique dual-screen 2-in-1s, though it still has a permanent physical keyboard.\nUnlike the C930, which disappeared without much notice, the Yoga Book 9i is sticking around for 2024 with updates to its processor and storage capacity. How do these improvements stack up to the 2023 edition? And are these improvements worth upgrading for those who have the original on their desks? To find out, Lenovo sent a 2024 Yoga Book 9i Gen 9 for this review.\nNew processing power, more storage for 2024\nThere's a lot to unpack with the 2024 edition of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i 9th Gen. Literally, as this 2-in-1 comes with a few accessories, including a stylus, a Bluetooth mouse, and its physical keyboard. The all-aluminum body is still in the same shade of Tidal Teal as 2023's model, the entire surface anodized via sandblasting for the matte finish it wears. Operating systems are Windows 11 Home or Pro with a trial of Microsoft Office bundled, which is the only difference between the two versions of the 9i 9th Gen available for sale. The physical Bluetooth keyboard and folding stand still perform their fun tricks with the Yoga Book, and the stylus is still useful for everything from signing documents to sketching out ideas for new business concepts.\nThe biggest change for the 2024 Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is under the hood. Last year's model used the processing power of the 13th-gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor. This year, the Core i7 is out, replaced by the Core Ultra 7 155U, a 14-thread mobile-computing processor with 12 cores (2 performance-oriented, 2 low-power efficient cores, and 8 efficient cores), capable of an Intel Max Turbo processing speed of 4.8 GHz. This output goes through a new set of soldered 16GB LPDDR5x-7467 RAM, replacing the original's -6400 units; you can upgrade to 32GB. The unit reviewed last year came with a 512GB M.2 2242 PCIe 4.0x4 NVMe SSD, though it could also be had with a 1TB SSD unit, which is also true for this year's model.\nNew processor, better results?\nLast time SlashGear reviewed the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i, the Intel Core i7 delivered a GeekBench 6.0.3 multi-core score of 11539, which we said was fine for moderate work, but not for gaming. Does the new Intel Ultra Core processor, then, change things? In some ways, yes. The processor received two scores from the latest version of GeekBench, 6.2.2. The single core score was 2283, and the multi-core score came out to 8099. On paper, this isn't the best set of scores when pegged at GeekBench's standard, the Intel Core i7-12700, and its single-core baseline of 2500. Higher numbers are better, so while the single-core score isn't too far off the mark, the multi-core score is arguably worse; the multi-core baseline is 10780, the score set by the same baseline processor with only 8 cores.\nBut perhaps there's a better way to think of this dual-screen laptop's purpose away from the numbers. Are you going to play \"iRacing\" or \"World of Warcraft\" on the Yoga Book 9i? No. Are you going to do some heavy video editing or graphic design with this flexible laptop? Also, no. But for entertainment purposes, sharing work documents, web browsing and other everyday tasks, the Intel Ultra Core fits right in. All things considered, the Ultra Core is likely a better fit for the 2024 version of the 9i than the original Core i7, since the former is built for mobile computing \u2014 the kind that the Yoga Book is meant for \u2014 while the latter needs more oomph inside whatever laptop it occupies.\nUnique dual-screen computing not for everyone\nAs mentioned earlier, there are few other laptops like the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. The biggest draw is the dual-touchscreen surface, which allows users to share projects with everyone in the room. The included keyboard cover doubles as a stand for presentations, with the physical Bluetooth keyboard and mouse ready to guide the visuals along. Of course, the second touchscreen has another trick up its sleeve: place your hands on the screen to activate the virtual keyboard and touchpad.\nThose used to typing on such things won't have too much difficulty on the Yoga Book 9i 9th Gen, while most users who prefer knowing exactly where their fingertips are at all times should go ahead and place the Bluetooth keyboard onto the second touchscreen. When they do, two options appear, based on positioning. Place the keyboard at the top, and the virtual touchpad and Lenovo Digital Pen 3 pad are ready to go. Place it at the bottom, and two widgets appear at the top: one for the local weather and another for the news items provided by MSN.\nSpeaking of the touchscreens, though, users will need to have a few lens-cleaning wipes available, since the displays will attract a few fingerprints. The 60Hz screens offer plenty of bold colors via DisplayHDR True Black 500 paired with Dolby Vision to make any presentation or YouTube video pop. The screens are also both Eyesafe Certified 2.0 and T\u00dcV Rheinland Low Blue Light (Hardware Solution) certified, so your eyes won't hurt on those long Netflix nights. And speaking of, the speakers on the Yoga Book 9i deliver a deep, rich sound to go with those visuals, though you'll want to turn down the volume, as those speakers are plenty loud at the lowest levels.\nTwo-in-one notebook with features to match\nThis being a Lenovo product, the Yoga Book 9i 9th Gen (2024) comes with plenty of software tucked away in the SSD, starting with Lenovo's own suite of goodies. Lenovo Vantage presents plenty of info on the 2-in-1, from how much charge is left in the battery to the laptop's temperature and the battery's remaining full charge capacity. There are also trial promotions of McAfee and Dropbox, though you could just download those for yourself. And since there are Microsoft products involved already, the Yoga Book 9i also has the Xbox Game Bar and the Xbox app with the Xbox Game Pass.\nThat said, if you opt for the base model with the 512 GB SSD, you might be asking why apps like Spotify, Grammarly, and the AI photo editor Luminar Neo are taking up precious space on your Yoga Book's solid state drive. It's not like you asked for these to be there when dropping nearly $2,000 on a niche product of a niche product like this dual-touchscreen wonder. Those who opt to upgrade to the 1TB SSD (a $30 upgrade) may be fine with what's there as far as bloatware goes, but only just.\nLenovo Yoga Book 9i 9th Gen Verdict\nThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i 9th Gen (2024) takes what the 2023 version introduced and rearranges things to remain a compelling choice for those looking for something out of the ordinary. After all, its only competitor in the dual-touchscreen laptop game is the aforementioned ASUS ZenBook Duo. The ASUS unit does offer a full-size Bluetooth keyboard with trackpad, HDMI port and a built-in kickstand, a pair of 14-inch touchscreens (compared to the Yoga Book's 13-inch units), and a more powerful Intel Ultra Core 9 processor, all for a starting price of $1,499.99.\nMeanwhile, the Yoga Book 9i 9th Gen (2024) starts at $1,980 with Windows 11 Home, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and no productivity software installed. It's quite the pricey proposition, for sure, especially with the ZenBook Duo right there for around $500 with more versatility. Not to mention that for the amount of money one could spend on the Yoga Book 9i, you could buy a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 3 with a little cash left in the bank.\nAs with the ThinkPad X1 Nano, though, Lenovo is once again a pioneer in a space few other companies have delved into. While many already have 2-in-1s on the market, the Yoga Book 9i takes everything up to 11 with its versatility. Its small size, great portability, and decent specs under the hood ensure this unique machine \u2014 one not meant for everyone, of course \u2014 will find its audience for years to come."
