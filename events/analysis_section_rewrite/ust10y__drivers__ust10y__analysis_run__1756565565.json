      "feedback": "The draft correctly links Fed‑cut probability, 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening, and tariff shock to a ~200 bp DXY decline, but it over‑relies on a single probability figure and repeats the same source ID (Z7O1DCHS7) without distinguishing the different mechanisms (Fed cut vs. tariff vs. spread). Tighten the causal chain by separating the three drivers: (1) Fed 25 bp cut → overnight rate drop → carry loss → DXY‑down (cite FAN5RYW6T for probability, XTQIQRP5K for carry effect); (2) 57 bp spread steepening → term‑premium rise → DXY‑down (cite Z7O1DCHS7 for spread impact); (3) Aug 29‑31 tariff announcement → trade‑balance drag → DXY‑down (cite FAN5RYW6T for tariff impact). Replace the generic “Fed cut lowers the overnight rate” with a quantified carry loss estimate (e.g., 0.5 bp per 1 bp cut). Add a counter‑argument that a 30 bp flattening of the spread would lift DXY by ~30 bp (cite 7XH2DKEKV). Explicitly state the magnitude of each upside scenario: PCE > 3.0 % → +70 bp, NFP > +200 k → +50 bp, flattening <30 bp → +30 bp. Remove the redundant sentence “the tariff shock, meanwhile, is expected to dampen U.S. trade balances and thus the dollar’s relative strength” because it repeats the tariff effect already cited. Clarify the watch list by listing exact dates: Fed meeting (early Sep), PCE (Aug 30), NFP (Aug 31), tariff window (Aug 29‑31), daily 2‑yr/10‑yr spread. Conclude with a concise confidence rating (“moderate‑high”) and note the fragility hinges on the next data releases. This will satisfy the requirement for explicit handle mapping (DXY), quantified catalysts, and a clear causal transmission path.",
