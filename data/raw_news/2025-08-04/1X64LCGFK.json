  "title": "Why Europe could quietly win the humanoid race",
  "description": "Europe is betting on real-world deployment, ethical design, and legal clarity \u2014 not flashy demos \u2014 to lead the next era of humanoid robotics.",
  "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s Optimus demo at Tesla\u2019s We Robot event made one thing clear: when it comes to humanoids, the spotlight still belongs to the United States. Then there is Asia \u2014 with China\u2019s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea\u2019s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.\n\nBehind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe \u2014 quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline and consistency required. And Europe has the potential to lead this new era.\n\nIn most conversations about innovation, regulation is framed as a brake. In Silicon Valley, it\u2019s often seen as a hurdle to scale or a signal of bureaucratic overreach. But Europe \u2014 particularly in AI and robotics \u2014 is rewriting that narrative. With the AI Act now adopted, the EU is the first region to offer comprehensive legal clarity around the deployment of high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots.\n\nWe must also consider that, eventually, other countries will likely adopt regulatory frameworks that align broadly with the EU\u2019s, even if they\u2019re less stringent. By designing with European standards from the outset, we\u2019ll be well-positioned to adapt quickly as new regulations emerge elsewhere.\n\nThis clarity matters. When investors and industrial partners can reliably assess compliance risks, they\u2019re most likely to commit resources. In a field as complex and potentially disruptive as robotics, clear rules don\u2019t slow down progress \u2014 they de-risk it.\n\nEurope has also introduced or updated several other regulations that directly impact robotics:\n\u2022 None now includes software and AI, reducing ambiguity and incentivising safer design practices.\n\nTogether, these frameworks give the EU a coherent and predictable regulatory environment. Yes, it\u2019s tough, but given the implications, this provides exactly what the humanoid sector needs: clarity.\n\nWhile the US often relies on innovation funded by Big Tech monopolies and China leans on state-driven manufacturing strategies, Europe\u2019s robotics sector is built on modular collaboration. Startups and research labs spin out into well-funded clusters, often supported by EU-backed initiatives like RI4EU and EIC Accelerator. These programs offer access to testbeds, pilot funding, and collaborative R&D networks.\n\nFurthermore, Europe\u2019s geographic and industrial structure gives it a special advantage: close proximity to real-world use cases. Having neighbouring logistics hubs, manufacturing zones, and retail chains in contiguity helps speed iteration and aligns development with the continent\u2019s actual operational pain points. McKinsey estimates that in some of Europe\u2019s critical sectors \u2014 including retail and logistics \u2014 payroll alone amounts to $1.7 trillion (\u20ac1.55 trillion). This makes automation highly profitable and ripe for disruption.\n\nThese factors have played a key role in the strategy of Humanoid, the robotics company I founded in the UK last year. Our goal isn\u2019t just to impress on stage; it\u2019s far more important that we seamlessly integrate innovations into real workflows. For this, we\u2019ve adopted a simple, modular design philosophy: a wheeled base that suits logistics environments, accelerated by simulation plus feedback from real industry trials. We believe that hype must be based on reality \u2014 a mindset that\u2019s drawing US investors to European robotics.\n\nThis shift is already reflected in funding dynamics. Neura Robotics\u2019 \u20ac120mn funding round in January 2025 was one of the largest in European robotics to date. And investors are now betting on full-stack teams with credible deployment strategies \u2014 instead of merely speculative tech.\n\nA better fit for the future of work\n\nBeyond reducing uncertainty, European regulation also helps encode values that shape how humanoid robots are developed and deployed. The AI Act requires high-risk systems \u2014 including those used in workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings \u2014 to meet strict safety, transparency, and human oversight standards.\n\nSuch a framework fosters trust, which is essential for robots operating in sensitive environments like factories, hospitals, or elderly care facilities. Europe\u2019s emphasis on traceability and ethical co-development goes beyond mitigating risk \u2014 it creates the conditions for adoption at scale, where safety and dignity are non-negotiable.\n\nAdditionally, this approach helps position robots as partners. By designing for augmentation rather than displacement \u2014 as often seen in the US \u2014 European startups are modelling a more human-centred approach to automation. They\u2019re also offering an alternative to the dominant narrative that robots will replace humans in critical roles.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that some jobs aren\u2019t meant for people, as they hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. For instance, a humanoid could take over the task of moving boxes around a warehouse all day. This is not simply a replacement; it is an augmentation of existing automation capabilities, which empowers people to find more purpose-driven work.\n\nThat distinction comes into sharper focus when we look at the places where humanoids are most needed, such as logistics hubs, clinics, and care homes. These environments have real spatial and regulatory constraints and little room for error. The tasks there are repetitive but require precision, and people are extremely busy. In these settings, robots need to quietly support the flow of work, not interrupt it. That requires thoughtful integration, which means responding at the right pace, handling objects predictably, and, yes, staying out of the way when needed.\n\nThese are practical challenges shaped by day-to-day routines, not only engineering feats. And, from our vantage point, Europe\u2019s cautious, user-informed development model is well-suited to meet them.\n\nThere are still concerns in European robotics that need to be addressed. As of 2025, China controls 63% of the humanoid hardware supply chain, from rare-earth magnets to key actuators. However, we\u2019re now seeing global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Europe partnering with humanoid creators early on to co-develop hardware components together. This strategy can mitigate the risk of over-dependence.\n\nOn the other hand, while the US dominates in AI software, few actors globally offer fully-integrated stacks. We see some moves in that direction in the US and China, and Europe \u2014 which is still dependent on imports \u2014 must learn to navigate this space assertively.\n\nCalls for supply diversification are growing. In June 2025, Benjamin Krieger, from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), emphasised the need for stronger EU supply chain routes due to China\u2019s export controls on rare-earth elements. In the US, analysts are sounding similar alarms.\n\nTo reduce dependency, Europe will need to support local manufacturing of key components, incentivise alternative sourcing, and form trade alliances outside Beijing\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe next phase of humanoid robotics will not be won by whoever moves fastest. It will be won by whoever builds best.\n\nWhat will this require? To start, bolstering funding and support mechanisms that help innovations advance through the later stages of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale \u2014 and move from pilots to industrial-grade rollouts. Second, forging industrial partnerships that begin during prototyping, not after. Third, policy agility to fast-track certification while maintaining the highest safety standards.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake isn\u2019t just who secures the most patents \u2014 we\u2019ve already seen that happen without meaningful real-world deployment. The true challenge is whether we can build systems that integrate safely into human environments, uphold public trust, and address the real concerns people have \u2014 from privacy and transparency to everyday safety and interaction.\n\nEurope doesn\u2019t need to mimic Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Instead, it needs to double down on what it already does well: interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical tech design, and industrial pragmatism.\n\nThe global humanoid race is not a sprint \u2014 it\u2019s a long-term infrastructure project. And if we get it right, Europe could build the future\u2019s most trusted workforce \u2014- one that collaborates with humans and changes the world, one robot at a time.",

      "text": "American tech companies are racing to usher in the development of humanoid robots, stressing their importance to the future economy. But analysts warn they are already at risk of losing out to competitors in China.\nSo-called humanoid robots \u2014 artificial intelligence-powered machines designed to resemble humans in appearance and movement \u2014 are expected to provide a range of use cases, such as filling industrial and service sector jobs.\nInvestor excitement surrounding the robots has been mounting amid increased mentions from tech leaders like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who ushered in \"the age of generalist robotics\" earlier this month as he announced a new portfolio of technologies for humanoid robot development.\nIn the manufacturing of the robots themselves, Tesla's humanoid robot project, Optimus, appears to be leading in the U.S., with CEO Elon Musk announcing plans to produce about 5,000 units this year.\nWhile Musk's ambitious plans could give it a leg up on U.S. competitors like Apptronik and Boston Dynamics that are yet to hit the mass market, he will face stiff competition from a familiar source: China.\nHangzhou-based Unitree Robotics last month briefly sold two humanoid robots to consumers on the e-commerce platform JD.com, as per local media. Meanwhile, Shanghai-based robotics startup Agibot, also known as Zhiyuan Robotics, has matched Optimus's goal to produce 5,000 robots this year, according to the South China Morning Post.\nAs Chinese electric vehicle companies like BYD begin outpacing Tesla's growth and undercutting its prices, experts say a similar dynamic could play out in humanoid robotics.\n\"China has the potential to replicate its disruptive impact from the EV industry in the humanoid space. However, this time the disruption could extend far beyond a single industry, potentially transforming the labor force itself,\" said Reyk Knuhtsen, analyst at SemiAnalysis, an independent research and analysis company specializing in semiconductors and AI.\nDancing on the competition?\nIn a research note in February, Morgan Stanley estimated that current building costs of humanoid robots could range from $10,000 to $300,000 per unit, given different configurations and downstream application requirements.\nHowever, Chinese companies are already undercutting U.S. competitors in terms of price thanks to superior economies of scale and manufacturing capabilities, according to Knuhtsen.\nFor example, Unitree released its G1 humanoid robot for consumers in May with a starting price of $16,000. In comparison, Morgan Stanley estimates that the selling cost of Tesla's Optimus Gen2 humanoid robot could be around $20,000, but only if the company is able to scale, shorten its research and development cycle, and use cost-effective components from China.\nUnitree made a major splash in the robot's space in January when 16 of its highest-performing H1 humanoid robots joined a group of human dancers to celebrate the Lunar New Year in a demonstration broadcast on national television.\nBut there are signs that China's progress in robots go much further. Morgan Stanley's February research note found that the country has led the world in patent filings mentioning \"humanoid\" over the past five years, with 5,688 patents compared with 1,483 from the United States.\nLarge players such as Xiaomi and EV makers, such as BYD, Chery, and Xpeng, are also involved in the humanoid robot space.\n\"Our research suggests China continues to show the most impressive progress in humanoid robotics where startups are benefitting from established supply chains, local adoption opportunities, and strong degrees of national government support,\" the note said.\nBeijing has increasingly backed the space, with government departments promoting their development. In 2023, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued guidelines for the space, calling for \"production at scale\" by 2025.\nAccording to Ming Hsun Lee, head of Greater China automotive and industrials research at BofA Global Research, China sees humanoid robots as an important industry because of their potential to mitigate looming labor shortages.\n\"I think in the short-term, three to four years, we will see humanoid robots initially applied in production lines to compare some workers, and in the midterm, we will see them gradually spread into the service industry,\" he said.\nMusk predicted that he'd have over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla in 2025. According to Chinese state media, EV makers like BYD and Geely have already deployed some of Unitree's humanoid robots at their factories.\nLee said that increased adoption will coincide with a \"very fast\" decline in component costs, also noting that China owns around 70% of the supply chain for these components.\nAccording to a report by SemiAnalysis earlier this month, the Unitree G1 \u2014 \"the only viable humanoid robot on the market\" \u2014 is entirely decoupled from American components.\nThe report warns that China is the only country positioned to reap the economic awards of intelligent robotics systems, including humanoid robots, which \"poses an existential threat to the US as it is outcompeted in all capacities.\"\n\"To catch up, U.S. players must rapidly mobilize a strong manufacturing and industrial base, whether domestically or through allied nations ... For Tesla and similar firms, it may be wise to begin reshoring or 'friendshoring' their component sourcing and manufacturing to reduce reliance on China,\" said SemiAnalysis' Knuhtsen.\nBank of America analysts predicted in a research note this month that the deployment of humanoid robots will accelerate rapidly, aided by the development of AI, with global annual sales reaching 1 million units by 2030 and 3 billion humanoid robots in operation by 2060."

In the interest of clarity, Directives 2001/95/EC and 87/357/EEC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation. |\n|\n(3) |\nA regulation is the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which leave no scope for divergent transposition by Member States. The choice of a regulation instead of a directive also allows for better delivery of the objective of ensuring coherence with the market surveillance legislative framework for products falling within the scope of Union harmonisation legislation, where the applicable legal instrument is also a regulation, namely Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Finally, such a choice will further reduce the regulatory burden through a consistent application of product safety rules across the Union. |\n|\n(4) |\nThe aim of this Regulation is to contribute to the attainment of the objectives referred to in Article 169 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In particular, it should aim to ensure the health and safety of consumers and the functioning of the internal market as regards products intended for consumers. |\n|\n(5) |\nThis Regulation should aim at protecting consumers and their safety as one of the fundamental principles of the Union legal framework and as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \u2018Charter\u2019). Dangerous products can have very negative consequences for consumers and citizens. All consumers, including the most vulnerable, such as children, older persons or persons with disabilities, have the right to safe products. Consumers should have at their disposal sufficient means to enforce that right and Member States should have adequate instruments and measures at their disposal to enforce this Regulation. |\n|\n(6) |\nDespite the development of sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that addresses the safety aspects of specific products or categories of products, it is practically impossible to adopt Union law for all consumer products that exist or may be developed. There is therefore a need for a broad-based legislative framework of a horizontal nature to fill gaps and to complement provisions in existing or forthcoming sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation and ensure consumer protection not otherwise ensured by that legislation, in particular with a view to achieving a high level of protection of the health and safety of consumers, as required by Articles 114 and 169 TFEU. |\n|\n(7) |\nAt the same time, in respect of products that are subject to sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation, the scope of the different parts of this Regulation should be clearly set out to avoid overlapping provisions and to ensure a clear legal framework. |\n|\n(8) |\nWhilst some of the provisions of this Regulation, such as most of the obligations of economic operators, should not apply to products covered by Union harmonisation legislation, certain other provisions of this Regulation are complementary to Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore apply to such products. In particular, the general product safety requirement and related provisions should apply to consumer products covered by Union harmonisation legislation when certain types of risks are not covered by that Union harmonisation legislation. The provisions of this Regulation concerning the obligations of providers of online marketplaces, the obligations of economic operators in the event of accidents, the right to information and to a remedy for consumers as well as the product safety recalls should apply to products covered by Union harmonisation legislation to the extent that there are no specific provisions with the same objective in such Union harmonisation legislation. Likewise, RAPEX is already used for the purposes of Union harmonisation legislation, as referred to in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020: therefore the provisions of this Regulation regulating the Safety Gate and its functioning should apply to products covered by Union harmonisation legislation. |\n|\n(9) |\nProducts which are designed exclusively for professional use, but which have subsequently migrated to the consumer market, should be subject to this Regulation because they could pose risks to the health and safety of consumers when used under reasonably foreseeable conditions. |\n|\n(10) |\nMedicinal products are subject to a pre-market assessment that includes a specific risk-benefit analysis. Those products should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. |\n|\n(11) |\nUnion law on food, feed and related areas sets up a specific system ensuring the safety of the products covered by it. Indeed, food and feed products have a specific legal framework established, in particular, by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). Furthermore, food and feed products are also regulated by Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), which ensures a harmonised approach with regard to official controls for verifying compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules. Therefore, food and feed products should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation, with the exception of materials and articles intended to come into contact with food insofar as risks are concerned that are not covered by Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) or by other food-specific legislation which only covers chemical and biological food-related risks. |\n|\n(12) |\nLiving plants are subject to a specific legal framework, provided for, in particular, by Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) which takes into consideration the specificities of those products to ensure consumer safety. |\n|\n(13) |\nAnimal by-products are materials of animal origin that people do not consume. Those products, such as feed, are subject to a specific legal framework, provided for, in particular, by Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). |\n|\n(14) |\nPlant protection products, also referred to as pesticides, are subject to specific provisions for their authorisation at national level, based on Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), and should therefore also be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. |\n|\n(15) |\nAircraft referred to in Article 2(3), point (d) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) are subject to the regulatory control of the Member States, in light of their limited risk to civil aviation safety. Those aircraft should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. |\n|\n(16) |\nThe requirements laid down in this Regulation should apply to second-hand products or products that are repaired, reconditioned or recycled, that re-enter the supply chain in the course of a commercial activity, except for those products for which the consumer cannot reasonably expect that they fulfil state-of-the art safety standards, such as products which are explicitly presented as to be repaired or to be reconditioned, or which are made available on the market as collectible items of historical significance. |\n|\n(17) |\nServices should not be covered by this Regulation. However, in order to protect the health and safety of consumers, products that are supplied or made available to consumers in the context of the provision of services, including products to which consumers are directly exposed during the provision of a service, should fall within the scope of this Regulation. However, equipment on which consumers ride or travel, where such equipment is directly operated by a service provider within the context of a transport service, should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation since it has to be dealt with in conjunction with the safety of the service provided. |\n|\n(18) |\nAntiques, such as works of art or collectors\u2019 items are specific categories of products which cannot be expected to meet the safety requirements laid down by this Regulation, and should therefore be excluded from its scope. However, in order to prevent other products from being mistakenly considered as belonging to those categories, it is necessary to take into account that works of art are products created solely for artistic purposes, that collectors\u2019 items are of sufficient rarity and historical or scientific interest to justify their collection and preservation, and that antiques, if they are not already works of art or collectors\u2019 items or both, are of an extraordinary age. When assessing whether a product is an antique, such as a work of art or a collector\u2019s item, Annex IX to Council Directive 2006/112/EC (13) could be taken into account. |\n|\n(19) |\nThe World Health Organisation defines \u2018health\u2019 as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. |\n|\n(20) |\nDistance selling, including online selling, should also fall within the scope of this Regulation. Online selling has grown consistently and steadily, creating new business models, new challenges regarding product safety and new actors in the market, such as providers of online marketplaces. |\n|\n(21) |\nIn the case of a product offered for sale online or through other means of distance sales, the product should be considered to have been made available on the market if the offer for sale is targeted at consumers in the Union. In line with the applicable Union rules on private international law, a case-by-case analysis should be carried out in order to establish whether an offer is targeted at consumers in the Union. An offer for sale should be considered to be targeted at consumers in the Union if the relevant economic operator directs, by any means, its activities to a Member State. For the case-by-case analyses, relevant factors, such as the geographical areas to which dispatch is possible, the languages available, used for the offer or for ordering, means of payment, the use of currency of the Member State or a domain name registered in one of the Member States should be taken into consideration. In the case of online sales, the mere fact that the economic operators\u2019 or the providers of online marketplaces\u2019 interface is accessible in the Member State in which the consumer is established or domiciled is insufficient. |\n|\n(22) |\nUnder the general safety requirement laid down in this Regulation, economic operators should be obliged to place only safe products on the market. Such a high level of safety should be primarily achieved through the design and the features of the product, taking into account the intended and foreseeable use and conditions of use of the product. The remaining risks, if any, should be alleviated by means of certain safeguards, such as warnings and instructions. |\n|\n(23) |\nThe safety of a product should be assessed taking into account all relevant aspects of the product, in particular its characteristics, such as the physical, mechanical and chemical characteristics, and its presentation, as well as the specific needs and risks which the product represents for certain categories of consumers who are likely to use the products, in particular children, older persons and persons with disabilities. Those risks can also include environmental risk insofar as it poses a risk to the health and safety of consumers. That assessment should take into account the health risk posed by digitally connected products, including the risk to mental health, especially of vulnerable consumers, in particular children. Therefore, when assessing the safety of digitally connected products likely to have an impact on children, manufacturers should ensure that the products they make available on the market meet the highest standards of safety, security and privacy by design, in the best interests of children. Furthermore, if specific information is necessary to make products safe for a certain category of persons, the assessment of the safety of the products should take into consideration also the presence of that information and its accessibility. The safety of all products should be assessed taking into consideration the need for the product to be safe over its entire lifespan. |\n|\n(24) |\nItems which connect to other items or non-embedded items which influence the way another item works can present a risk for the safety of the product. That aspect should be given due consideration as a potential risk. The connections and interrelation that an item might have with external items should not jeopardise its safety. |\n|\n(25) |\nNew technologies might pose new risks to consumers\u2019 health and safety or change the way the existing risks could materialise, such as an external intervention hacking the product or changing its characteristics. New technologies might substantially modify the original product, for instance through software updates, which should then be subject to a new risk assessment if that substantial modification were to have an impact on the safety of the product. |\n|\n(26) |\nSpecific cybersecurity risks affecting the safety of consumers, as well as protocols and certifications, can be dealt with by sectoral legislation. However, it should be ensured that, in cases where such sectoral legislation does not apply, the relevant economic operators and national authorities take into consideration risks linked to new technologies, when designing the products and assessing them respectively, in order to ensure that changes introduced in the product do not jeopardise its safety. |\n|\n(27) |\nIn order to facilitate the effective and consistent application of the general safety requirement laid down in this Regulation, it is important to make use of European standards covering certain products and risks. European standards, the references of which have been published in accordance with Directive 2001/95/EC, should continue providing a presumption of conformity with the general safety requirement laid down in this Regulation. Standardisation requests issued by the Commission in accordance with Directive 2001/95/EC should be deemed to be standardisation requests issued in accordance with this Regulation. In the event that different risks or risk categories are covered by the same standard, the conformity of a product with the part of the standard covering the relevant risk or risk category would also give to the product itself a presumption of safety as far as the relevant risk or risk category is concerned. |\n|\n(28) |\nWhere the Commission identifies a need for a European standard ensuring compliance of certain products with the general safety requirement laid down in this Regulation, it should apply the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) to request one or more European standardisation organisations to either draft or identify a standard which is suitable to ensure that products which conform to it are presumed to be safe. |\n|\n(29) |\nProducts could present different risks for different genders and standardisation activities should take that into account to avoid discrepancies in terms of safety and therefore a gender safety gap. The Declaration on Gender Responsive Standards of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe outlines several actions that national standards bodies and standards developing organisations should include in their gender action plan for gender responsive standards and standards development, in order to achieve gender-balanced, representative and inclusive standards. |\n|\n(30) |\nTogether with the adaptation of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, a specific procedure for the adoption of the specific safety requirements with the assistance of the specialised Committee provided for by this Regulation should be introduced. |\n|\n(31) |\nIn the absence of European standards, the national law of the Member State where the product is made available on the market laying down health and safety requirements should comply with Union law, in particular Articles 34 and 36 TFEU. |\n|\n(32) |\nEconomic operators should have proportionate obligations concerning the safety of products, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of the health and safety of consumers, while also ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market. All economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market products which are safe and in conformity with this Regulation. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations corresponding to the role of each operator in the supply and distribution process. For example, as regards the verification of whether the manufacturer and, where relevant, the importer have complied with their obligations, the distributor should only be required to perform factual verifications and not an assessment of the information provided by them. The information about the identification of the product and of the economic operators, as well as instructions and safety information, could in addition be provided by the economic operators in a digital form by means of electronic solutions, such as a QR or data matrix code. |\n|\n(33) |\nManufacturers should draw up technical documentation regarding the products they place on the market, which should contain the necessary information to prove that those products are safe. The technical documentation should be based on an internal risk analysis carried out by the manufacturer. The amount of information to be provided in the technical documentation should be proportionate to the complexity of the product and the possible risks identified by the manufacturer. In particular, manufacturers should provide a general description of the product and the elements necessary to assess its safety. In the case of complex products or products presenting possible risks, the information to be provided might need a more extensive description of the product. In such cases, an analysis of those risks and the technical means adopted to mitigate or eliminate the risks should also be included. Where the product complies with European standards or other elements applied to meet the general safety requirement laid down in this Regulation, the list of the relevant European standards or the other elements should also be indicated. |\n|\n(34) |\nAny natural or legal person that either places a product on the market under their own name or trademark or substantially modifies a product in such a way that conformity with the requirements of this Regulation might be affected, should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer. |\n|\n(35) |\nModification of a product, by physical or digital means, might have consequences on the nature and characteristics of the product in a way which was not foreseen in the initial risk assessment of the product and which might jeopardise the safety of the product. Such modification should therefore be considered as a substantial modification and, when not done by the consumer or on his behalf, should lead to the product being considered as a new product from a different manufacturer. In order to ensure compliance with the general safety requirement laid down in this Regulation, the person that carries out that substantial modification should be considered as the manufacturer and subject to the same obligations. That requirement should only apply with respect to the modified part of the product, provided that the modification does not affect the product as a whole. In order to avoid an unnecessary and disproportionate burden, the person carrying out the substantial modification should not be required to repeat tests and produce new documentation in relation to aspects of the product that are not impacted by the modification. It should be up to the person that carries out the substantial modification to demonstrate that the modification does not have an impact on the product as a whole. |\n|\n(36) |\nInternal conformity procedures, through which economic operators ensure, internally, the effective and swift performance of their obligations as well as the conditions to react timely in the case of a dangerous product, should be put in place by the economic operators themselves. |\n|\n(37) |\nIn order to prevent the placing on the market of dangerous products, it should be compulsory for economic operators to include in their production or marketing activities internal processes ensuring compliance with the relevant requirements of this Regulation. Such internal processes should be determined by economic operators themselves in relation to their role in the supply chain and the type of products concerned and can be based, for example, upon organisational procedures, guidelines, standards or upon the appointment of an ad hoc manager. The establishment and format of such internal processes should remain the sole responsibility of relevant economic operators. |\n|\n(38) |\nCooperation from all economic operators and providers of online marketplaces with market surveillance authorities in order to eliminate or mitigate risks for the relevant products made available on the market is essential. However, the requests made to them by market surveillance authorities should be tailored to the role they play in the supply chain and with regard to their respective legal obligations. |\n|\n(39) |\nDirect selling by economic operators established outside the Union through online channels hinders the work of market surveillance authorities when tackling dangerous products in the Union, as in many instances economic operators may neither be established nor have a legal representative in the Union. It is therefore necessary to ensure that market surveillance authorities have adequate powers and means to tackle in an effective manner the sale of dangerous products online. In order to ensure the effective enforcement of this Regulation, the obligation set out in Article 4(1), (2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should be extended to products falling outside the scope of Union harmonisation legislation to ensure that there is a responsible economic operator established in the Union, which is entrusted with tasks regarding such products, providing market surveillance authorities with an interlocutor and, where appropriate with regard to the possible risks related to a product, performing specific tasks in a timely manner to ensure that the products are safe. Those specific tasks should include regular checks with regard to compliance with the technical documentation, product and manufacturer information, instruction and safety information. |\n|\n(40) |\nThe contact information of the economic operator established in the Union and responsible for products falling within the scope of this Regulation should be indicated with the product in order to facilitate checks throughout the supply chain. |\n|\n(41) |\nIn order for economic operators that are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including micro-enterprises, to be able to cope with the new obligations imposed by this Regulation, the Commission should provide practical guidelines and tailored guidance, for example a direct channel to connect to experts in the event of questions, taking into account the need to simplify and limit their administrative burdens. |\n|\n(42) |\nEnsuring product identification and the provision of information on the manufacturer and other relevant economic operators throughout the entire supply chain helps to identify economic operators and, where applicable, to take effective and proportionate corrective measures against dangerous products, such as targeted recalls. Product identification and the provision of information on the manufacturer and other relevant economic operators thus ensures that consumers, including persons with disabilities, and market surveillance authorities obtain accurate information regarding dangerous products, which enhances confidence in the market and avoids unnecessary disruption of trade. Products should therefore bear information allowing their identification and the identification of the manufacturer and, where applicable, of the importer and other relevant economic operators. Such requirements could be made stricter for certain kinds of products that are likely to present a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers, by a system of collection and storage of data enabling, besides the identification of the product, the identification of its components or of the economic operators involved in its supply chain. This should be without prejudice to the information requirements laid down by Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), related to the main characteristics of the goods, to the extent appropriate to the medium and to the nature of the goods. A picture should be considered as a photograph, illustration or other pictographic element, which easily allows the identification of a product or potential product. |\n|\n(43) |\nEnsuring that manufacturers notify accidents that are caused by a product they made available on the market will improve the information available to market surveillance authorities and allow for a better identification of potentially dangerous categories of products. Rules on product liability of economic operators for defective products are laid down in specific Union law and such notification and collection of data should not therefore be considered as an admission of liability for a defective product or as confirmation of liability under relevant Union or national law. |\n|\n(44) |\nIn order to be able to detect early emerging new risks and other product safety related market trends, all interested parties, including consumer or business organisations, should be encouraged to signal to market surveillance authorities and to the Commission information available to them to detect and investigate infringements of this Regulation. |\n|\n(45) |\nProviders of online marketplaces play a crucial role in the supply chain, allowing economic operators to reach a greater number of consumers, and therefore also in the product safety system. |\n|\n(46) |\nUnder the new complex business models linked to online sales, the same entity can provide a variety of services. Depending on the nature of the services provided for a given product, the same entity can fall within different categories of business models under this Regulation. When an entity provides only online intermediation services for a given product, then it would qualify only as a provider of an online marketplace for that product. In the event that the same entity provides both online marketplace services for the sale of a particular product and also acts as an economic operator under this Regulation, it would qualify also as the relevant economic operator. In such a case, the entity in question would therefore have to comply with the obligations applicable to the relevant economic operator. For instance, if the provider of the online marketplace also distributes a product, then, with respect to the sale of the distributed product, it would be considered to be a distributor. Similarly, if the entity in question sells its own branded products, it would act as a manufacturer and would thus need to comply with the applicable requirements for manufacturers. Also, some entities can qualify as fulfilment service providers if they offer fulfilment services. Such cases would thus need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. |\n|\n(47) |\nGiven the important role played by providers of online marketplaces when intermediating the sale of products between traders and consumers, such actors should have more responsibilities in tackling the sale of dangerous products online. Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) provides the general framework for e-commerce and lays down certain obligations for online platforms. Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) regulates the responsibility and accountability of providers of intermediary services online with regard to illegal contents, including dangerous products. That Regulation applies without prejudice to the rules laid down by Union law on consumer protection and product safety. Accordingly, building on the horizontal legal framework provided by that Regulation, specific requirements essential to tackle in an effective manner the sale of dangerous products online should be introduced, in line with Article 2(4), point (f) of that Regulation. To the extent that this Regulation specifies the requirements, in relation to product safety, with which providers of online marketplaces are to comply in order to ensure compliance with certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, those requirements should not affect the application of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, which continues to apply to those providers of online marketplaces. |\n|\n(48) |\nThe Product Safety Pledge, first signed in 2018 and joined by a number of providers of online marketplaces since then, provides for a number of voluntary commitments on product safety. The Product Safety Pledge has proved its rationale in enhancing the protection of consumers against dangerous products sold online. In order to strengthen the protection of consumers by avoiding damage to their life, health and safety and to ensure fair competition in the internal market, providers of online marketplaces are encouraged to undertake those voluntary commitments to prevent the re-appearance of listings of dangerous products already withdrawn. The use of technologies and digital processes and the improvements in alert systems, in particular the Safety Gate Portal, can allow the automatic identification and communication of notified dangerous products and to carry out automated random checks against the Safety Gate Portal. |\n|\n(49) |\nProviders of online marketplaces should act with due care in relation to the content hosted on their online interfaces that concerns product safety, in accordance with the specific obligations laid down in this Regulation. Accordingly, this Regulation should lay down due diligence obligations for all providers of online marketplaces in relation to the content hosted on their online interfaces that concerns product safety. |\n|\n(50) |\nMoreover, for the purposes of effective market surveillance, providers of online marketplaces should register in the Safety Gate Portal and indicate, in the Safety Gate Portal, the information concerning their single point of contact for the facilitation of communication of information on product safety issues. The Commission should ensure that the registration is easy and user-friendly. The single point of contact under this Regulation might be the same as the point of contact under Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, without endangering the objective of treating issues linked to product safety in a swift and specific manner. |\n|\n(51) |\nProviders of online marketplaces should designate a single point of contact for consumers. That single point of contact should serve as a single window for consumer communications on product safety issues, which can then be redirected to the proper service unit of an online marketplace. This should not prevent additional points of contact for specific services being made available to consumers. The single point of contact under this Regulation might be the same as the point of contact under Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. |\n|\n(52) |\nIn order to be able to comply with their obligations under this Regulation, in particular in respect of the timely and effective compliance with the orders of public authorities, the processing of notices of other third parties and cooperation with market surveillance authorities in the context of corrective measures upon request, providers of online marketplaces should have in place an internal mechanism for handling product safety-related issues. |\n|\n(53) |\nArticle 14(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 provides market surveillance authorities with the power, where no other effective means are available to eliminate a serious risk, to require the removal of content referring to the related products from an online interface or to require the explicit display of a warning to end users when they access an online interface. The powers entrusted to market surveillance authorities by Article 14(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should also apply to this Regulation. For effective market surveillance under this Regulation and to avoid dangerous products being present on the Union market, those powers should apply in all necessary and proportionate cases and also for products presenting a less than serious risk. It is essential that providers of online marketplaces comply with such orders as a matter of urgency. Therefore, this Regulation should introduce binding time-limits in that respect. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. |\n|\n(54) |\nOrders which also require the provider of an online marketplace to remove from its online interface all identical content referring to the offer of a dangerous product specified in the order, should identify the elements that will determine and allow the provider of an online marketplace to remove identical offers, based on the information displayed by the traders, to the extent that the provider of an online marketplace is not required to carry out an independent assessment of that content. |\n|\n(55) |\nWhere the information from the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System does not contain an exact uniform resource locator (URL) and, where necessary, additional information enabling the identification of the content referring to an offer of a dangerous product, providers of online marketplaces should nevertheless take into account the transmitted information, such as product identifiers, when available, and other traceability information, in the context of any measures adopted by providers of online marketplaces on their own initiative aiming at detecting, identifying, removing or disabling access to such offers of dangerous products on their online interface, where applicable. Nonetheless, the Safety Gate Portal should be modernised and updated in order to make it easier for providers of online marketplaces to detect unsafe products and, with that aim, it should be possible to implement the provisions of this Regulation on the removal of content referring to an offer of a dangerous product from online interfaces by means of a notification system designed and developed within the Safety Gate Portal. |\n|\n(56) |\nThe obligations imposed by this Regulation on providers of online marketplaces should not amount to a general obligation to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor should they require providers of online marketplaces to actively seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity, such as the sale of dangerous products online. Nonetheless, in order to benefit from the exemption from liability for hosting services under Directive 2000/31/EC and Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, providers of online marketplaces should remove content referring to an offer of a dangerous product from their online interfaces expeditiously, upon obtaining actual knowledge or, in the case of claims for damages, upon becoming aware of the content referring to an offer of a dangerous product, in particular in cases in which the provider of online marketplace has been made aware of facts or circumstances on the basis of which a diligent economic operator should have identified the illegality in question. Providers of online marketplaces should process notices concerning content referring to an offer of a dangerous product, received in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, within the additional timeframes established by this Regulation. In addition, providers of online marketplaces are encouraged to check products with Safety Gate Portal before placing them on their interface. |\n|\n(57) |\nFor the purposes of Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, and concerning the safety of products sold online, the Digital Services Coordinator should consider in particular consumer organisations and associations representing consumers\u2019 interests and other relevant stakeholders, upon their request, as trusted flaggers, provided that the conditions set out in that Article have been met. |\n|\n(58) |\nProduct traceability is fundamental for effective market surveillance of dangerous products and corrective measures. Consumers should also be protected against dangerous products in the same way in the offline and online sales channels, including when purchasing products on online marketplaces. Building on the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 concerning the traceability of traders, providers of online marketplaces should not allow a specific product offer to be listed on their platforms unless the trader has provided all information related to product safety and traceability as specified in this Regulation. Such information should be displayed together with the product listing so that consumers can benefit from the same information made available online and offline. However, providers of online marketplaces should not be responsible for verifying the completeness, correctness and the accuracy of the information itself, as the obligation to ensure the traceability of products lies with the relevant trader. |\n|\n(59) |\nIt is also important that providers of online marketplaces cooperate closely with the market surveillance authorities, with traders and with relevant economic operators on the safety of products. Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 imposes an obligation on information society service providers to cooperate with market surveillance authorities in relation to products covered by that Regulation. That obligation should therefore be extended to all consumer products. For instance, market surveillance authorities are constantly improving the technological tools they use for online market surveillance to identify dangerous products sold online. For those tools to be operational, providers of online marketplaces should grant access to their interfaces. Moreover, for the purpose of product safety, market surveillance authorities should also have the possibility to scrape data from an online interface upon reasoned request in the case of technical obstacles put in place by providers of online marketplaces or online sellers. Providers of online marketplaces should also cooperate on product recalls and on accident reporting. |\n|\n(60) |\nThe legal framework for market surveillance of products covered by Union harmonisation legislation and set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and the legal framework for market surveillance of products covered by this Regulation should be as coherent as possible. It is therefore necessary, as far as market surveillance activities, obligations, powers, measures, and cooperation among market surveillance authorities are concerned, to align the two sets of provisions. For that purpose Article 10, Article 11(1) to (7), Articles 12 to 15, Article 16(1) to (5), Articles 18 and 19 and Articles 21 to 24 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply also to products covered by this Regulation. |\n|\n(61) |\nPursuant to Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18) (the Union Customs Code), products from third countries intended to be made available on the Union market or intended for private use or consumption within the customs territory of the Union are placed under the customs procedure \u2018release for free circulation\u2019. That procedure aims to complete the formalities laid down in respect of the import of the goods, including the enforcement of the applicable provisions of Union law, so that those goods can be made available on the Union market like any product made in the Union. As far as consumer safety is concerned, those products are required to comply with this Regulation and, in particular, with the general safety requirement laid down in this Regulation. |\n|\n(62) |\nChapter VII of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, laying down rules for controls on products entering the Union market, is already directly applicable to products covered by this Regulation. The authorities in charge of those controls should perform them on the basis of risk analysis as referred to in Articles 46 and 47 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, the implementing legislation and corresponding guidance. Therefore, this Regulation does not modify in any way Chapter VII of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and the way the authorities in charge of controls on products entering the Union market organise themselves and perform their activities. |\n|\n(63) |\nMember States should ensure that any measures taken by their competent authorities under this Regulation are subject to effective judicial remedies in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter. |\n|\n(64) |\nNational authorities should be enabled to complement the traditional market surveillance activities focused on safety of products with market surveillance activities focusing on the internal conformity procedures set up by economic operators to ensure product safety. Market surveillance authorities should be able to require the manufacturer to indicate which other products \u2013 produced with the same procedure, or containing the same components considered to present a risk or that are part of the same production batch \u2013 are affected by the same risk. |\n|\n(65) |\nMember States should also ensure that the market surveillance authorities have sufficient expertise and resources for all their enforcement activities. |\n|\n(66) |\nAn exchange of information between Member States and the Commission concerning the application of this Regulation should be established on the basis of output indicators which would allow measurement of the effectiveness of Union product safety legislation. |\n|\n(67) |\nThere should be effective, speedy and accurate exchange of information concerning dangerous products to ensure that appropriate measures are taken in relation to those products and thereby to protect the health and safety of consumers. |\n|\n(68) |\nRAPEX should be modernised to enable more efficient corrective measures to be taken across the Union in relation to products that present a risk beyond the territory of a single Member State. It is opportune to change the abbreviated name from RAPEX to Safety Gate for greater clarity and better outreach to consumers. Safety Gate comprises three elements: first, a rapid alert system on dangerous non-food products whereby national authorities and the Commission can exchange information on such products (Safety Gate Rapid Alert System); second, a web portal to inform the public and enable them to submit complaints (Safety Gate Portal); and third, a web portal to enable businesses to comply with their obligation to inform authorities and consumers of dangerous products and accidents (Safety Business Gateway). Interfaces should exist between the different Safety Gate elements. The Safety Gate Rapid Alert System is the internal system through which authorities and the Commission exchange information on measures concerning dangerous products, and which can contain confidential information. An extract of alerts should be published on the Safety Gate Portal in order to inform the public about dangerous products. The Safety Business Gateway is the web portal through which businesses inform market surveillance authorities of the Member States about dangerous products and about accidents. The Commission should develop a technical solution to ensure that the information entered by businesses in the Safety Business Gateway that is meant to alert consumers can be made available to consumers on the Safety Gate Portal without undue delay. In addition, the Commission should develop an interoperable interface to enable providers of online marketplaces to link their interfaces with the Safety Gate Portal in an easy, quick and reliable way. |\n|\n(69) |\nMember States should notify in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System both compulsory and voluntary corrective measures that prevent, restrict or impose specific conditions on the possible marketing of a product because of a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers or, in the case of products covered by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, also to other relevant public interests of end-users. |\n|\n(70) |\nUnder Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, Member States\u2019 authorities are to notify measures taken against products covered by that Regulation, presenting a less than serious risk, through the information and communication system referred to in that Article, while corrective measures taken against products covered by this Regulation presenting a less than serious risk could also be notified in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System. Member States and the Commission should make available to the public information relating to risks to the health and safety of consumers posed by products. It is opportune for consumers and businesses that all information on corrective measures taken against products presenting a serious risk is contained in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, allowing relevant information on dangerous products to be made available to the public through the Safety Gate Portal. It is important to ensure that all of that information is available in the official language(s) of the consumer\u2019s Member State of residence and that it is written in a clear and understandable manner. Member States are therefore encouraged to notify in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System all corrective measures on products presenting a risk to the health and safety of consumers. |\n|\n(71) |\nIn the event that the information has to be notified in the information and communication system in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, there is the possibility for such notifications to be submitted directly in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System or to be generated from within the information and communication system for market surveillance provided for in Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. For that purpose, the Commission should maintain and further develop the interface that has been set up for the transfer of information between that information and communication system and the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, in order to avoid double data entry and to facilitate such transfer. |\n|\n(72) |\nThe Commission should maintain and further develop the Safety Business Gateway web portal, enabling economic operators to comply with their obligations to inform market surveillance authorities and consumers of dangerous products they have made available on the market. It should enable quick and efficient information exchange between economic operators and national authorities, and facilitate information to consumers from economic operators. |\n|\n(73) |\nThere might be cases where it is necessary to deal with a serious risk at Union level where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member State concerned or by any other procedure under Union law. This could in particular be the case as regards new emerging risks or those impacting vulnerable consumers. For that reason the Commission should be able to adopt measures either on its own initiative or upon request of the Member States. Such measures should be adapted to the gravity and urgency of the situation. It is furthermore necessary to provide for an adequate mechanism whereby the Commission could adopt immediately applicable interim measures. |\n|\n(74) |\nThe determination of the risk concerning a product and its level is based on a risk assessment performed by the relevant actors. Member States, in performing such a risk assessment, might reach different results as far as the presence of a risk or its level is concerned. This could jeopardise the correct functioning of the internal market and the level playing field for both consumers and economic operators. A mechanism should therefore be established to allow the Commission to provide an opinion on the issue in dispute. |\n|\n(75) |\nThe Commission should draw up a periodic report on the application of the mechanism under Article 29, which should be presented to the European network of the Member States\u2019 authorities competent for product safety under this Regulation (\u2018Consumer Safety Network\u2019). That report should identify the main criteria applied by the Member States for risk assessment and their impact on the internal market and on an equal level of consumer protection, with the aim of enabling Member States and the Commission to harmonise the approaches and criteria for risk assessment. |\n|\n(76) |\nThe Consumer Safety Network enhances the cooperation on product safety enforcement between Member States. In particular, it facilitates the activities of exchange of information, the organisation of joint market surveillance activities and the exchange of expertise and best practices. It should also contribute to the harmonisation of the methodologies to collect data on product safety, as well as to an increase in the interoperability between regional, sectoral, national and European information systems for product safety. The Consumer Safety Network should be duly represented and participate in the coordination and cooperation activities of the Union Product Compliance Network provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 whenever coordination of activities falling within the scope of both Regulations is necessary to ensure their effectiveness. |\n|\n(77) |\nTo preserve the coherence of the market surveillance legal framework and, at the same time, ensure an effective cooperation between the Consumer Safety Network and the Union Product Compliance Network, aimed at structured coordination and cooperation between Member States\u2019 enforcement authorities and the Commission provided for by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, it is necessary to associate the Consumer Safety Network to the Union Product Compliance Network in the activities referred to in Articles 11, 12, 13 and 21 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. |\n|\n(78) |\nMarket surveillance authorities should carry out joint activities with other authorities or organisations representing economic operators or consumers, with a view to promoting the safety of products and identifying dangerous products, including those that are offered for sale online. In doing so, the market surveillance authorities and the Commission, as appropriate, should ensure that the choice of products and producers as well as the activities performed does not create situations which might distort competition or affect the objectivity, independence and impartiality of the parties. The market surveillance authorities should make available to the public the agreements on joint activities as soon as possible, providing such publication does not jeopardise the effectiveness of the activities to be undertaken. |\n|\n(79) |\nThe Commission should organise, on regular basis, a joint activity whereby market surveillance authorities should conduct inspections on products acquired under a cover identity online or offline, in particular on those products that are most frequently notified within the Safety Gate. |\n|\n(80) |\nSimultaneous coordinated control actions (\u2018sweeps\u2019) are specific enforcement actions that could further enhance product safety and should therefore be conducted to detect online and offline infringements to this Regulation. In particular, sweeps should be conducted where market trends, consumer complaints or other indications suggest that certain products or product categories are often found to present a serious risk. |\n|\n(81) |\nPublic access to the information available to the authorities on product safety should, as a general rule, be ensured. However, in making available information on product safety to the public, professional secrecy, as referred to in Article 339 TFEU, should be protected in a way which is compatible with the need to ensure the effectiveness of market surveillance activities and of protection measures. |\n|\n(82) |\nComplaints are important in terms of raising awareness of national authorities about the safety and effectiveness of surveillance and control activities relating to dangerous products. Member States should therefore give to consumers and other interested parties such as consumer associations and economic operators the possibility to submit such complaints. |\n|\n(83) |\nThe public interface of the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, the Safety Gate Portal, allows the general public, including consumers, economic operators and providers of online marketplaces, to be informed about corrective measures taken against dangerous products present on the Union market. A separate section of the Safety Gate Portal enables consumers to inform the Commission of products found on the market presenting a risk to the health and safety of consumers. Where relevant, the Commission should provide adequate follow-up, in particular by transmitting such information to the national authorities concerned. The database and website of the Safety Gate should be easily accessible for persons with disabilities. |\n|\n(84) |\nAfter verification of the accuracy of the information received from consumers and other interested parties, the Commission should ensure an appropriate follow-up. In particular, the Commission should forward the information to the relevant Member States so that the competent market surveillance authority can proceed as appropriate and needed. It is important that consumers and other interested parties are properly informed of the Commission action. |\n|\n(85) |\nWhen a product already sold to consumers turns out to be dangerous, it may need to be recalled to protect consumers in the Union. Consumers might not be aware that they own a recalled product. In order to increase recall effectiveness, it is therefore important to better reach the consumers concerned. Direct contact is the most effective method to increase consumers\u2019 awareness of recalls and encourage action. It is also the preferred communication channel across all groups of consumers. In order to ensure the safety of the consumers, it is important that they are informed in a quick and reliable way. Economic operators and, where applicable, providers of online marketplaces should therefore use the customer data at their disposal to inform consumers of recalls and safety warnings linked to products they have purchased. Therefore, a legal obligation is needed to require economic operators and providers of online marketplaces to use any customer data already at their disposal to inform consumers of recalls and safety warnings. In that respect, economic operators and providers of online marketplaces should ensure that they include the possibility to directly contact customers in the case of a recall or safety warning affecting them in existing customer loyalty programmes and product registration systems, through which customers are asked, after having purchased a product, to communicate to the manufacturer on a voluntary basis some information such as their name, contact information, the product model or serial number. The mere fact that recalls are targeted at consumers should not prevent economic operators and providers of online marketplaces from making all customers aware of a product recall notice nor from offering remedies to other end-users. Economic operators and providers of online marketplaces should be encouraged to take such actions, especially in the case of micro- and small enterprises acting like consumers. |\n|\n(86) |\nConsumers should be encouraged to register products in order to receive information about recalls and safety warnings. The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts in order to specify that for some specific products or categories of products, consumers should always have the possibility to register a product they have purchased in order to be directly notified about a recall or a safety warning related to that product. In determining the specific products or categories of products subject to that requirement, due consideration should be given to the lifecycle of the products or categories of products at stake, as well as to the risks the products pose, the frequency of recalls and the category of users of the products, in particular vulnerable consumers. |\n|\n(87) |\nOne-third of consumers continue to use dangerous products despite seeing a recall notice, particularly because recall notices are drafted in a complex way or minimise the risk at stake. The recall notice should therefore be clear, transparent and clearly describe the risk at stake, avoiding any terms, expressions or other elements that may decrease consumers\u2019 perception of the risk. Consumers should also be able to get more information, if needed, through a toll-free telephone number or other interactive instrument. |\n|\n(88) |\nTo encourage consumer response to recalls it is also important that the action required from consumers be as simple as possible and that the remedies offered be effective, cost-free and timely. Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) provides consumers with the contractual remedies for a lack of conformity of physical goods that existed at the time of delivery and became apparent within the liability period laid down by the Member States in accordance with Article 10(3) of that Directive. Article 14 of Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) also applies in terms of the tangible medium, such as DVDs, CDs, USB sticks and memory cards, used to carry a digital content. However, situations where dangerous products are recalled from the market justify having a specific set of rules that should be applied without prejudice to contractual remedies because their objectives are different. Whereas contractual remedies serve the purpose of remedying the lack of conformity of the goods with the contract, the remedies in the event of a recall serve both to ensure elimination of dangerous products from the market and an adequate remedy for the consumer. As a consequence, there are major differences between the two sets of potential remedies: firstly, in the event of a product recall under this Regulation, there should be no time limitation to activate the remedies; secondly, the consumer should be entitled to request remedies from the relevant economic operator, not necessarily from the trader. Moreover, in the event of a recall, the consumer should not have to prove that the product is dangerous. |\n|\n(89) |\nGiven the different objectives of remedies provided in the event of a recall of a dangerous product and remedies for non-conformity of goods with the contract, consumers should use the system corresponding to the relevant situation. For example, if the consumer receives a recall notice with a description of the remedies available to the consumer, the consumer should act according to the instructions in the recall notice. Nevertheless, he or she should not be deprived of the possibility to ask for remedies from the seller based on non-conformity of the dangerous goods with the contract. |\n|\n(90) |\nOnce the consumer has been provided with a remedy as a follow-up to a recall, the consumer could not be entitled to a remedy for non-conformity of the good with the contract for reasons connected with the fact that the product was dangerous because the non-conformity does not exist anymore. Similarly, in the event that the consumer invokes the consumer\u2019s rights to a remedy under Directive (EU) 2019/770 or Directive (EU) 2019/771, the consumer is not entitled to a remedy under this Regulation for the same safety issue. However, if other requirements for conformity regarding the same good are not fulfilled, the seller would remain liable for such non-conformity of the good with the contract even if there has been a remedy provided to the consumer following a recall of a dangerous product. |\n|\n(91) |\nEconomic operators initiating a product recall should offer consumers at least two options between repair, replacement, or adequate refund of the value of the recalled product, except where impossible or disproportionate. Offering consumers a choice between remedies can improve the effectiveness of a recall. In addition, incentives to motivate consumers to participate in a recall, such as discounts or vouchers, should be encouraged in order to increase the effectiveness of recalls. The repair of the product should only be considered a possible remedy if the safety of the repaired product can be ensured. The amount of the refund should be at least equal to the price paid by the consumer, without prejudice to a further compensation as provided for in national laws. Where no proof of the price paid is available, an adequate refund of the value of the recalled product should still be provided. In the event of recalls of the tangible medium for digital content within the meaning of Article 2, point (1) of Directive (EU) 2019/770, the refund should cover all sums paid by the consumer under the contract, as provided for in Article 16(1) of that Directive. Any remedy should be without prejudice to the consumers\u2019 right to damages under national law. |\n|\n(92) |\nRemedies offered in the event of a product safety recall should not place an excessive burden on consumers nor place them at risk. If the remedy also entails the disposal of the recalled product, such disposal should be carried out with due consideration of the environmental and sustainable objectives set at Union and national levels. In addition, repair by consumers should only be considered as a possible remedy if it can be carried out easily and safely by the consumer, for instance through the replacement of a battery or by cutting excessively long drawstrings on a children\u2019s garment when provided for in the recall notice. Moreover, the repair by the consumer should be without prejudice to consumers\u2019 rights under Directives (EU) 2019/770 and (EU) 2019/771. Therefore, in such situations, economic operators should not oblige consumers to repair a dangerous product. |\n|\n(93) |\nThis Regulation should also encourage economic operators and providers of online marketplaces to enter into voluntary memoranda of understanding with competent authorities, the Commission or organisations representing consumers or economic operators to undertake product safety related voluntary commitments that go beyond the legal obligations laid down in Union law. |\n|\n(94) |\nConsumers should be entitled to enforce their rights in relation to the obligations imposed on economic operators or providers of online marketplaces under this Regulation through representative actions in accordance with Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21). For that purpose, this Regulation should provide that Directive (EU) 2020/1828 is applicable to the representative actions concerning infringements of this Regulation that harm or can harm the collective interests of consumers. Annex I to that Directive should therefore be amended accordingly. It is for the Member States to ensure that that amendment is reflected in their transposition measures adopted in accordance with that Directive, although the adoption of national transposition measures in that regard is not a condition for the applicability of that Directive to those representative actions. The applicability of that Directive to the representative actions brought against infringements by economic operators or providers of online marketplaces of provisions of this Regulation that harm or can harm the collective interests of consumers should start from the date of application of this Regulation. Until that date, consumers should be able to rely on the applicability of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 in line with point 8 of Annex I to that Directive. |\n|\n(95) |\nThe Union should be able to cooperate and to exchange information related to product safety with regulatory authorities of third countries or international organisations within the framework of agreements concluded between the Union and third countries or international organisations or of arrangements concluded between the Commission and authorities of third countries or international organisations, also with a view to preventing the circulation of dangerous products on the market. Such cooperation and exchange of information should respect confidentiality and personal data protection rules of the Union. Personal data should only be transferred to the extent that such exchange is necessary for the sole purpose of the protection of the health or safety of consumers. |\n|\n(96) |\nSystematic exchange of information between the Commission and third countries or international organisations on the safety of consumer products and on preventive, restrictive and corrective measures should be based on reciprocity, which entails an equivalent but not necessarily identical exchange of information for mutual benefit. An exchange of information with a third country producing goods destined for the Union market might consist in the Commission sending selected information from the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System related to products originating from that third country. In exchange, that third country might send information on the follow-up measures taken on the basis of the notifications received. Such cooperation might contribute to the objective of stopping dangerous products at the source and preventing them from reaching the Union market. |\n|\n(97) |\nIn order to have a significant deterrent effect for economic operators and, where applicable, providers of online marketplaces to prevent the placing of dangerous products on the market, penalties should be adequate to the type of infringement, to the possible advantage for the economic operator or provider of an online marketplace and to the type and gravity of the injury suffered by the consumer. Penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. |\n|\n(98) |\nWhen imposing penalties, due consideration should be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement in question. The imposition of penalties should be proportionate and should comply with Union and national law, including with applicable procedural safeguards and with the principles of the Charter. |\n|\n(99) |\nIn order to maintain a high level of health and safety of consumers, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the identification and traceability of products bearing a potential serious risk to the health and safety of consumers and of the functioning of the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, in particular to adopt the modalities and procedures for the exchange of information regarding measures communicated through the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System and criteria to assess the level of risk. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (22). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. |\n|\n(100) |\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt the specific safety requirements, to determine the output indicators on the basis of which Member States have to communicate data concerning the implementation of this Regulation; to specify tasks and roles of single national contact points; to take measures as regards Union action against products presenting a serious risk; to adopt the modalities for the sending of information by consumers in the Safety Gate Portal; to specify the implementation of the interoperable interface on the Safety Gate Portal; to set out the requirements for registration of products for product safety recall purposes; and to adopt the template for a recall notice. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23). |\n|\n(101) |\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the health and safety of consumers, imperative grounds of urgency so require. |\n|\n(102) |\nThe Commission should carry out an evaluation of the implementation of the penalties laid down under this Regulation as regards their effectiveness and deterrent effects, and, where appropriate, adopt a legislative proposal in relation to their enforcement. |\n|\n(103) |\nCertain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 should be amended to take the specificities of this Regulation into account, and in particular the need to determine the specific safety requirements under this Regulation before launching the request to the European standardisation organisation. |\n|\n(104) |\nDirective 87/357/EEC, which covers consumer products which, although not foodstuff, resemble foodstuff and are likely to be confused with foodstuff in such a way that consumers, especially children, may place them in their mouths, suck or ingest them and which might cause, for example, suffocation, poisoning, the perforation or obstruction of the digestive tract, has given rise to controversial interpretation. Furthermore, that Directive was adopted at a time where the legal framework for consumer product safety was very limited in scope. For those reasons, Directive 87/357/EEC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation, in particular, the provisions of this Regulation which ensure that, following risk assessment, products which can be harmful when placed in mouth, sucked or ingested and which are likely to be confused with foodstuff due to their form, odour, colour, appearance, packaging, labelling, volume, size or other characteristics, should be considered dangerous. In performing their evaluation, market surveillance authorities should take into consideration, inter alia, that, as held by the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is not necessary to demonstrate by objective and substantiated data that placing in the mouth, sucking or ingesting food-imitating products may entail risks such as suffocation, poisoning, or the perforation or obstruction of the digestive tract. Nevertheless, the competent national authorities should assess on a case-by-case basis whether such products are dangerous and justify that assessment. |\n|\n(105) |\nIn order to allow economic operators and providers of online marketplaces sufficient time to adapt to the requirements of this Regulation, including information requirements, it is necessary to provide for a sufficient transitional period after the date of entry into force of this Regulation during which products covered by Directive 2001/95/EC which are in conformity with that Directive may still be placed on the market. Member States should therefore not impede the making available on the market of such products, including offers for sale. |\n|\n(106) |\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to improve the functioning of the internal market while providing for a high level of consumer protection, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States given the need for a high degree of collaboration and coherent action between Member States\u2019 competent authorities and for a mechanism to quickly and efficiently exchange information on dangerous products in the Union but can rather, by reason of the Union-wide character of the problem, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. |\n|\n(107) |\nWhere, for the purposes of this Regulation, it is necessary to process personal data, such processing should be carried out in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data. Any processing of personal data under this Regulation is subject to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (24) and (EU) 2018/1725 (25) and Directive 2002/58/EC (26) of the European Parliament and of the Council, as applicable. When consumers report a product in the Safety Gate Portal, only those personal data should be stored that are necessary to report the dangerous product and for a period not exceeding five years after such data have been entered. Manufacturers and importers should hold the register of consumer complaints only as long as it is necessary for the purpose of this Regulation. Manufacturers and importers, when they are natural persons should disclose their names to ensure that the consumer is able to identify the product for purpose of traceability. |\n|\n(108) |\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, |\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nObjective and subject matter\n1.

Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States shall inform the Commission about corrective measures taken by their authorities or by economic operators on the basis of this Regulation and the Commission shall forward that information to the other Member States. For that purpose, Member States may notify through the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System corrective measures taken by their authorities or by economic operators on the basis of this Regulation, of Union harmonisation legislation and of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 in relation to products presenting a less than serious risk.\n4. The national authorities shall submit notifications as referred to in paragraph 1 through the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System without delay and in any event within four working days after the corrective measure is taken.\n5. By four working days after receiving a complete notification, the Commission shall check whether it complies with this Article and with the requirements related to the operation of the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System defined by the Commission on the basis of paragraph 10. If the notification complies with this Article and those requirements, the Commission shall transmit it to the other Member States.\n6. Member States shall notify through the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System without undue delay any update, modification or withdrawal of the corrective measures referred in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.\n7. Where a Member State notifies corrective measures taken in relation to products presenting a serious risk, the other Member States shall notify through the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System the corrective measures or other actions taken subsequently in relation to the same products and any other relevant information, including the results of any tests or analyses carried out, without undue delay and in any event no later than four working days after the measures or actions are taken.\n8. If the Commission identifies, including on the basis of information received by consumers or consumer organisations, products which are likely to present a serious risk and for which Member States have not submitted a notification through the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, it shall inform the Member States thereof. Member States shall undertake the appropriate verifications and, if they adopt measures, notify them through the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System in accordance with paragraph 1.\n9. The Commission shall implement the interface referred to in Article 20(5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 between the information and communication system referred to in Article 34 of that Regulation and the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System to enable a draft Safety Gate Rapid Alert System notification to be triggered from that information and communication system in order to avoid double data entry.\n10. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 45 to supplement this Regulation by specifying, in particular:\n|\n(a) |\nthe access to the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System; |\n|\n(b) |\nthe operation of the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System; |\n|\n(c) |\nthe information to be entered in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System; |\n|\n(d) |\nthe requirements notifications must meet; and |\n|\n(e) |\nthe criteria for assessment of the level of risk. |\nArticle 27\nSafety Business Gateway\n1. The Commission shall maintain a web portal enabling economic operators and providers of online marketplaces to provide, in an easy way, market surveillance authorities and consumers with the information referred to in Article 9(8) and (9), Article 10(2), point (c), Article 11(2) and (8), Article 12(4), Articles 20 and 22 (the \u2018Safety Business Gateway\u2019).\n2. The Commission shall draw up guidelines for the practical implementation of the Safety Business Gateway.\nCHAPTER VII\nCOMMISSION\u2019S ROLE AND ENFORCEMENT COORDINATION\nArticle 28\nUnion action against products presenting a serious risk\n1. If the Commission becomes aware of a product, or a specific category or group of products, presenting a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers, it may take any appropriate measures, either on its own initiative or upon request of Member States, by means of implementing acts, adapted to the gravity and urgency of the situation if:\n|\n(a) |\nthe risk cannot be dealt with, in view of the nature of the safety issue posed by the product, category or group of products, in a manner compatible with the degree of gravity or urgency of the case, under other procedures laid down by the specific Union law applicable to the products concerned; and |\n|\n(b) |\nthe risk can be eliminated in an effective manner only by adopting appropriate measures applicable at Union level, in order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of the health and safety of consumers and the proper functioning of the internal market. |\nThose measures may include measures prohibiting, suspending or restricting the placing or making available on the market of such products or laying down special conditions for their conformity assessment with regard to the safety requirement, as applicable, or for their marketing, such as representative sample testing of those products, in order to ensure a high level of consumer safety protection.\nMember States shall, within their jurisdiction, take all appropriate enforcement measures necessary to ensure the effective implementation of those implementing acts. The competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall inform the Commission of the enforcement measures taken.\nThe Commission shall regularly evaluate the efficiency of the enforcement measures taken by Member States and inform the Consumer Safety Network of the outcome of that evaluation.\n2. The implementing acts referred to in the paragraph 1 shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 46(3). Those implementing acts shall specify the date on which they will cease to apply.\n3.

The export from the Union of a product that has been prohibited to be placed or made available on the Union market pursuant to a measure adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 shall be prohibited, unless the measure expressly so permits for duly justified reasons.\n5. Any Member State may submit a substantiated request to the Commission to examine the need for the adoption of a measure referred to in paragraph 1 or paragraph 3.\nArticle 29\nRequest for an opinion from the Commission on divergences in risk assessment\n1. Products that have been deemed to be dangerous on the basis of a decision of a market surveillance authority in one Member State under this Regulation shall be presumed dangerous by market surveillance authorities in other Member States.\n2. Where market surveillance authorities in different Member States reach divergent conclusions in terms of identification or level of the risk on the basis of their own investigation and risk assessment, any Member State may refer the matter to the Commission, requesting its opinion on the matter and the Commission shall, without undue delay, issue an opinion on the identification or on the level of the risk of the relevant product, as appropriate. Where the matter has not been referred to the Commission, the Commission may nevertheless issue an opinion on its own initiative. For the purpose of issuing an opinion referred to in this paragraph, the Commission may ask for relevant information and documents and shall invite all Member States to express their views.\n3. Where the Commission issues an opinion pursuant to paragraph 2, the Member States shall take it into due account.\n4. The Commission shall draw up guidelines for the practical implementation of this Article.\n5. The Commission shall periodically draw up a report on the application of this Article and shall present it to the Consumer Safety Network.\nArticle 30\nConsumer Safety Network\n1. A European network of the authorities of the Member States competent for product safety (the \u2018Consumer Safety Network\u2019) is hereby established.\nThe purpose of the Consumer Safety Network shall be to serve as a platform for structured coordination and cooperation between authorities of the Member States and the Commission in enhancing product safety in the Union.\n2. The Commission shall promote and take part in the operation of the Consumer Safety Network, in particular in the form of administrative cooperation.\n3. The tasks of the Consumer Safety Network shall be, in particular, to:\n|\n(a) |\nfacilitate the regular exchange of information on risk assessments, dangerous products, test methods and results, standards, methodologies for the collection of data, interoperability of information and communication systems, recent scientific developments and the use of new technologies as well as other aspects relevant for control activities; |\n|\n(b) |\norganise the establishment and execution of joint surveillance and testing projects, including in the context of e-commerce; |\n|\n(c) |\npromote the exchange of expertise and best practices and cooperation in training activities; |\n|\n(d) |\nimprove cooperation at Union level with regard to the tracing, withdrawal and recall of dangerous products; |\n|\n(e) |\nfacilitate enhanced and structured cooperation on product safety enforcement between Member States, in particular to facilitate the activities referred to in Article 32; and |\n|\n(f) |\nfacilitate the implementation of this Regulation. |\n4. The Consumer Safety Network shall coordinate its action with the other existing Union activities related to market surveillance and consumer safety and, where relevant, shall cooperate and exchange information with other Union networks, groups and bodies.\n5. The Consumer Safety Network shall adopt its work programme, which, inter alia, shall set out the priorities for safety of the products and for the risks covered by this Regulation, in the Union.\nThe Consumer Safety Network shall meet at regular intervals and, where necessary, at the duly justified request of the Commission or a Member State.\nThe Consumer Safety Network may invite experts and other third parties, including consumer organisations, to attend its meetings.\n6. The Consumer Safety Network shall be duly represented and regularly participate in the relevant activities of the Union Product Compliance Network established under Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and shall contribute to its activities in relation to product safety to ensure adequate coordination of market surveillance activities in both harmonised and non-harmonised areas.\nArticle 31\nJoint activities on product safety\n1. In the framework of the activities referred to in Article 30(3), point (b), market surveillance authorities may agree with other relevant authorities or with organisations representing economic operators or consumers to carry out activities aimed at ensuring safety and protection of consumers health with respect to specific categories of products made available on the market, in particular categories of products that are often found to present a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers.\n2. The relevant market surveillance authorities and the parties referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure that the agreement to carry out such activities does not lead to unfair competition between economic operators and does not affect the objectivity, independence and impartiality of those parties.\n3. The Commission shall organise on a regular basis joint activities of market surveillance authorities whereby the market surveillance authorities conduct inspections regarding products offered online or offline, which those authorities acquired under a cover identity.\n4. A market surveillance authority may use any information obtained as a result of the joint activities carried out as part of any investigation undertaken by it regarding the safety of products.\n5. The market surveillance authority concerned shall make the agreement on joint activities, including the names of the parties involved, available to the public and shall enter that agreement in the information and communication system referred to in Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. The Commission shall make that agreement available on the Safety Gate Portal.\nArticle 32\nSimultaneous coordinated control actions of market surveillance authorities (\u2018Sweeps\u2019)\n1. The market surveillance authorities concerned shall conduct simultaneous coordinated control actions (\u2018sweeps\u2019) of particular products or categories of products with the objective of checking compliance with this Regulation.\n2. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the market surveillance authorities involved, sweeps shall be coordinated by the Commission. The coordinator of the sweep shall, where appropriate, make the aggregated results publicly available.\n3. When conducting sweeps, the market surveillance authorities involved may use the investigation powers set out in Chapter V and any other powers conferred upon them by national law.\n4. Market surveillance authorities may invite Commission officials and other accompanying persons authorised by the Commission to participate in sweeps.\nCHAPTER VIII\nRIGHT TO INFORMATION AND TO A REMEDY\nArticle 33\nInformation between authorities and general public\n1. Information available to the authorities of the Member States or to the Commission relating to measures on products presenting risks to the health and safety of consumers shall in general be made available to the public, in accordance with the requirements of transparency and without prejudice to the restrictions required for monitoring and investigation activities. In particular, the public shall have access to information on product identification, the nature of the risk and the measures taken. That information shall also be provided in accessible formats for persons with disabilities.\n2. Member States and the Commission shall take the necessary steps to ensure that their officials and agents are required to protect information obtained for the purposes of this Regulation. That information shall be treated as confidential in accordance with Union and national law.\n3. Protection of professional secrecy shall not prevent the dissemination to the competent authorities of Member States and to the Commission of information relevant for ensuring the effectiveness of market monitoring and surveillance activities. The authorities receiving information covered by professional secrecy shall ensure its protection in accordance with Union and national law.\n4. Member States shall give consumers and other interested parties the opportunity to submit complaints to the competent authorities on product safety, on surveillance and control activities related to specific products as well as on instances where remedies offered to consumers in the case of product recalls are not satisfactory. Such complaints shall be followed up appropriately. The competent authorities shall provide the complainant with appropriate information on the follow-up, in accordance with national law.\nArticle 34\nSafety Gate Portal\n1. For the purpose of Article 9(9), Articles 20 and 22, Article 31(5) and Article 33(1), the Commission shall maintain a Safety Gate Portal, providing the general public with free of charge and open access to selected information notified in accordance with Article 26 (the \u2018Safety Gate Portal\u2019).\n2. The Safety Gate Portal shall have an interface which is intuitive for users and the information provided on that portal shall be easily accessible by the public, including by persons with disabilities.\n3. Consumers and other interested parties shall have the possibility to inform the Commission of products that might present a risk to the health and safety of consumers through a separate section of the Safety Gate Portal. The Commission shall give due consideration to the information received and, after verification of its accuracy, where appropriate, forward that information to the relevant Member States without undue delay to ensure that that information is appropriately followed-up. The Commission shall inform consumers and other interested parties of its action.\n4. The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, adopt the modalities for the sending of information by consumers in accordance with paragraph 3, as well as for the transmission of such information to the national authorities concerned for possible follow up. This implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 46(3).\n5. By 13 December 2024 the Commission shall develop an interoperable interface that allows providers of online marketplaces to link their interfaces to the Safety Gate Portal.\n6. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the implementation of the interoperable interface on the Safety Gate Portal in accordance with paragraph 5, in particular concerning the access to the system and its operation. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 46(3).\nArticle 35\nInformation from economic operators and providers of online marketplaces to consumers on product safety\n1. In the case of a product safety recall, or where certain information has to be brought to the attention of consumers to ensure the safe use of a product (\u2018safety warning\u2019), economic operators, in accordance with their respective obligations as provided for in Articles 9, 10, 11 and 12, and providers of online marketplaces in accordance with their obligations as provided for in Article 22(12), shall ensure that all affected consumers that can be identified are notified directly and without undue delay. Economic operators and, where applicable, providers of online marketplaces that collect their customers\u2019 personal data shall make use of that information for recalls and safety warnings.\n2. Where economic operators and providers of online marketplaces have in place product registration systems or customer loyalty programs enabling the identification of products bought by consumers for purposes other than contacting their customers with safety information, they shall offer the possibility to their customers to provide separate contact details only for safety-related purposes. The personal data collected for that purpose shall be limited to the necessary minimum and shall only be used to contact consumers in the event of a recall or safety warning.\n3. The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, set out, for specific products or categories of products, requirements to be met by economic operators and providers of online marketplaces to provide the possibility for consumers to register a product they have purchased in order to be notified directly in the case of a product safety recall or safety warning in relation to that product, in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 46(3).\n4. Where not all of the affected consumers can be contacted under paragraph 1, economic operators and providers of online marketplaces, in accordance with their respective responsibilities, shall disseminate a clear and visible recall notice or safety warning through other appropriate channels, ensuring the widest possible reach including, where available, the company\u2019s website, social media channels, newsletters and retail outlets and, as appropriate, announcements in mass media and other communication channels. Information shall be accessible to persons with disabilities.\nArticle 36\nRecall notice\n1. Where information on a product safety recall is provided to consumers in a written form, in accordance with Article 35(1) and (4), it shall take the form of a recall notice.\n2. A recall notice which can be easily understood by consumers shall be available in the language(s) of the Member State(s) where the product has been made available on the market and include the following elements:\n|\n(a) |\na headline consisting of the words \u2018Product safety recall\u2019; |\n|\n(b) |\na clear description of the recalled product, including:\n|\n|\n(c) |\na clear description of the hazard associated with the recalled product, avoiding any elements that may decrease consumers\u2019 perception of risk, such as by using terms and expressions such as \u2018voluntary\u2019, \u2018precautionary\u2019, \u2018discretionary\u2019, \u2018in rare situations\u2019 or \u2018in specific situations\u2019 or by indicating that there have been no reported accidents; |\n|\n(d) |\na clear description of the action consumers should take, including an instruction to immediately stop using the recalled product; |\n|\n(e) |\na clear description of the remedies available to consumers in accordance with Article 37; |\n|\n(f) |\na free phone number or interactive online service, where consumers can get more information in relevant official language(s) of the Union; and |\n|\n(g) |\nencouragement to share the information about the recall with other persons, if appropriate. |\n3. The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, set out the template for a recall notice, taking into account scientific and market developments. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 46(2). That template shall be made available by the Commission in a format that enables economic operators to easily create a recall notice, including in accessible formats for persons with disabilities.\nArticle 37\nRemedies in the event of a product safety recall\n1. Without prejudice to Directives (EU) 2019/770 and (EU) 2019/771, in the case of a product safety recall initiated by an economic operator or ordered by a national competent authority, the economic operator responsible for the product safety recall shall offer the consumer an effective, cost-free and timely remedy.\n2. Without prejudice to any other remedies that the economic operator responsible for the recall may offer the consumer, the economic operator shall offer the consumer the choice between at least two of the following remedies:\n|\n(a) |\nthe repair of the recalled product; |\n|\n(b) |\na replacement of the recalled product with a safe one of the same type and at least the same value and quality; or |\n|\n(c) |\nan adequate refund of the value of the recalled product, provided that the amount of the refund shall be at least equal to the price paid by the consumer. |\nBy way of exception to the first subparagraph, the economic operator may offer the consumer only one remedy where other remedies would be impossible or, compared to the proposed remedy, would impose costs on the economic operator responsible for the product safety recall that would be disproportionate, taking into account all circumstances, including whether the alternative remedy could be provided without significant inconvenience to the consumer.\nThe consumer shall always be entitled to a refund of the product when the economic operator responsible for the product safety recall has not completed the repair or replacement within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer.\n3. Repair by a consumer shall only be considered an effective remedy where it can be carried out easily and safely by the consumer and where envisaged in the recall notice. In such cases, the economic operator responsible for the product safety recall shall provide consumers with the necessary instructions, free replacement parts or software updates. Repair by a consumer shall not deprive the consumer of the rights provided for in Directives (EU) 2019/770 and (EU) 2019/771.\n4. Disposal of the product by consumers shall only be included in the actions to be taken by consumers under Article 36(2), point (d) where such disposal can be carried out easily and safely by the consumer, and shall not affect the right of the consumer to receive a refund for or replacement of the recalled product under paragraph 1 of this Article.\n5. The remedy shall not entail significant inconvenience for the consumer. The consumer shall not bear the costs of shipping or otherwise returning the product. For products that by their nature are not portable, the economic operator shall arrange for the collection of the product.\nArticle 38\nMemoranda of understanding\n1. National competent authorities and the Commission may promote voluntary memoranda of understanding with economic operators or providers of online marketplaces, as well as with organisations representing consumers or economic operators, aimed at undertaking voluntary commitments to enhance product safety.\n2. Voluntary commitments under such memoranda of understanding shall be without prejudice to the obligations of economic operators and providers of online marketplaces under this Regulation and other relevant Union law.\nArticle 39\nRepresentative actions\nDirective (EU) 2020/1828 shall apply to the representative actions brought against infringements by economic operators and providers of online marketplaces of provisions of this Regulation that harm, or may harm, the collective interests of consumers.\nCHAPTER IX\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\nArticle 40\nInternational cooperation\n1. In order to improve the overall level of safety of products made available on the market and to ensure a level playing field at international level, the Commission may cooperate, including through the exchange of information, with authorities of third countries or international organisations in the field of application of this Regulation. Any such cooperation shall be based on reciprocity, shall include provisions on confidentiality corresponding to those applicable in the Union and shall ensure that any exchange of information take place in accordance with applicable Union law. The cooperation or exchange of information may relate, inter alia, to the following:\n|\n(a) |\nenforcement activities and measures related to safety, also with a view to preventing the circulation of dangerous products, including market surveillance; |\n|\n(b) |\nrisk assessment methods and product testing; |\n|\n(c) |\ncoordinated product recalls and other similar actions; |\n|\n(d) |\nscientific, technical and regulatory matters, aiming to improve product safety and to develop common priorities and approaches at international level; |\n|\n(e) |\nemerging issues of significant health and safety relevance; |\n|\n(f) |\nuse of new technologies to improve product safety and increase traceability in the supply chain; |\n|\n(g) |\nstandardisation-related activities; |\n|\n(h) |\nexchange of officials and training programmes. |\n2. The Commission may provide third countries or international organisations with selected information from the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System and receive relevant information on the safety of products and on preventive, restrictive and corrective measures taken by those third countries or international organisations. The Commission shall share such information with national authorities, where relevant.\n3. The information exchange referred to in paragraph 2 may take the form of either:\n|\n(a) |\na non-systematic exchange, in duly justified and specific cases; or |\n|\n(b) |\na systematic exchange, based on an administrative arrangement specifying the type of information to be exchanged and the modalities for the exchange. |\n4. Full participation in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System may be open to applicant countries and third countries, provided that their legislation is aligned with the relevant Union law and that they participate in the European Standardisation System. Such participation shall entail the same obligations as for Member States according to this Regulation, including notification and follow-up obligations. Full participation in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System shall be based on agreements between the Union and those countries, according to arrangements defined in those agreements.\n5. Any information exchange under this Article shall, to the extent it involves personal data, be carried out in accordance with Union data protection rules.

      "text": "UK-based startup Humanoid has just shared a first look at its prototype humanoid robot \u2014 the HMND 01. It\u2019s not here to overthrow humanity (yet), but it may walk, work, and possibly even out-dress you.\nAt 5\u20199\u201d and 154lbs, the \u201clabour automation unit\u201d is the coworker who never calls in sick, never complains about overtime, and somehow always looks sharp. Yes, HMND 01 comes with a range of interchangeable outfits.\nThe humanoid is no slouch, either. It can walk at a brisk 5.4km/h, carry up to 15kgs, and work for four hours straight before it needs a coffee break. Or should I say, electricity recharge.\nCheck it out for yourself in the video below:\nHumanoid claims its bot has human-level (or better) dexterity for complex tasks and can navigate tight spaces like a pro. Whether it\u2019s lifting, packing, or navigating tight spaces in a warehouse, this robot is ready to take on the world. And by \u201cthe world,\u201d we mean retail, manufacturing, logistics, and pretty much any industry that involves repetitive tasks humans would rather avoid.\nRather than plotting world domination, Humanoid\u2019s founder Artem Sokolov envisions a future \u201cwhere humans and machines work side by side, not in competition, but in harmony.\u201d\n\u201cThis societal shift will address social issues such as workforce shortages and ageing population while giving people more freedom to focus on more creative and meaningful work,\u201d says Sokolov, a serial entrepreneur and investor who founded Humanoid last year.\n\u201cThe strongest argument in favour of humanoids is that the world is already designed for humans.\u201d This means humanoids \u2013 unlike robot dogs or wheeled robots \u2014 could move about our world with ease.\nHumanoid is still in the early stages of developing its robot, and it better hurry up. The space is getting increasingly crowded.\nTesla\u2019s Optimus is set to go on sale as early as this year, while Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas continues to backflip its way into our dreams (or nightmares?), and China\u2019s Unitree bots are perfecting their dance routines. These robots are poised to take over the jobs we don\u2019t want to do \u2014 and maybe a few we do.\nSo whether you\u2019re excited or nervously side-eyeing your toaster, one thing\u2019s certain: the future is looking decidedly humanoid. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to buy a new outfit. If the robots are going to out-dress me, I might as well go down in style.\nGet the TNW newsletter\nGet the most important tech news in your inbox each week."

      "text": "Introduction\nRisk hierarchy\nGeneral-purpose AI models\nRules for AI systems\nApplication of the Act\nPenalties\nCompetent authorities\nNational public authorities for fundamental rights supervision\nFurther information\nIntroduction\nThe EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act is an EU regulation which entered into force on 2 August 2024 and is directly applicable across the EU. The regulation applies in a phased manner over 36 months from entry into force.\nThe regulation is designed to provide a high level of protection to people\u2019s health, safety and fundamental rights, and to promote the adoption of human-centric, trustworthy AI. It will provide a harmonised regulatory framework for AI systems placed on the market, or deployed, in the EU.\nThe Act applies equally to uses of AI in the public service as to the private sector. However, it provides exemptions for certain applications of AI relating to national defence; national security; scientific R&D; R&D for AI systems, models; open-sourced models; and personal use.\nThe Act is not a blanket regulation applying to all AI systems. Rather, it adopts a risk-based approach to regulation, based on four risk categories in order to ensure that its measures are targeted and proportionate. The Act also makes allowance for the unique circumstances of SMEs. The four risk categories are described in the next section.\nRisk hierarchy underpinning the EU AI Act\nSource: European Commission\nUnacceptable risk\nThese are a set of eight harmful uses of AI that contravene EU values because they violate fundamental rights. These AI uses will be prohibited and include:\n- subliminal techniques likely to cause a person, or another, significant harm\n- exploiting vulnerabilities due to age, disability or social or economic situation\n- social scoring leading to disproportionate detrimental or unfavourable treatment\n- profiling individuals for prediction of criminal activity\n- untargeted scraping of facial image\n- inferring emotions in work or education\n- biometric categorisation of race, religion, sexual orientation\n- real-time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes\nThe prohibitions on uses with unacceptable risk apply from February 2025. Reference guidelines for the application of these provisions of the AI Act have been published by the European Commission:\nGuidelines on prohibited AI practices as defined by the AI Act\nHigh risk\nThere are two high-risk categories of AI usage.\nThe first category relates to the use of AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I of the Act, for example toys and machinery.\nThe provisions on product-linked high-risk AI systems apply from August 2027.\nThe second category relates to eight specific high-risk uses of AI listed in Annex III of the Act. These are AI systems that potentially create an adverse impact on people's safety or their fundamental rights, as protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and are high-risk.\nThe provisions on high-risk uses apply from August 2026.\nSpecific transparency risk\nThe AI Act introduces specific transparency requirements for certain AI applications where, for example, there is a clear risk of manipulation such as the use of chatbots or deepfakes.\nMinimal risk\nMost AI systems will only give rise to minimal risks and consequently, can be marketed and used subject to the existing legislation without additional legal obligations under the AI Act.\nGeneral-purpose AI models\nGeneral-purpose AI (GPAI) models, often referred to as foundational models, exhibit significant generality and are capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks. As a consequence of this power, they pose unique risks, including systemic risks to the EU. For this reason, there are specific provisions and obligations applying to GPAI models under the AI Act. The European Commission, through its AI Office, is responsible for enforcing these provisions.\nRules for AI systems\nThe AI Act introduces rules for certain AI systems placed on the market, or deployed, in the EU to mitigate the risks to people\u2019s health, safety and fundamental rights. These rules relate to, certification of AI systems\u2019 conformance with standards; governance of AI systems during development; and supervision of systems when in use.\nThe key responsibilities under the Act lie with providers and deployers of AI systems. However, there are also responsibilities for other actors in the supply chain: importers, distributors, and authorised representatives.\nApplication of the Act\nThe provisions of the EU AI Act apply in a phased manner from its entry into force in August 2024.\nKey milestones include:\nMember states must identify public bodies which supervise or enforce fundamental rights in relation to the use of high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III and make the list publicly available.\nRelated press release: Key milestone in the implementation of the EU regulation on AI\nRules on prohibited AI practices come into effect.\nProviders and deployers must ensure their staff have a sufficient level of AI literacy.\nMember states must designate competent authorities for the purposes of the Act;\nMember states must legislate for penalties for infringements of the Act.\nMember states must have an operational AI Regulatory Sandbox to support innovation.\nRules on high-risk AI systems (use cases - Annex III) come into effect.\nRules on high-risk AI systems (products/Annex I) come into effect.\nPenalties\nFor infringements of the rules for AI systems, the EU AI Act sets out the maximum applicable penalties as below.\n- Up to \u20ac35 million or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) for infringements on prohibited practices or non-compliance related to requirements on data\n- Up to \u20ac15 million or 3% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year for non-compliance with any of the other requirements or obligations of the Act\n- Up to \u20ac7.5 million or 1.5% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year for the supply of incorrect, incomplete or misleading information to notified bodies and national competent authorities in reply to a request from a competent authority\nFor each category of infringement, the threshold would be the lower of the two amounts for SMEs, and the higher for other companies.\nCompetent authorities designated by government\nThe government has approved a recommendation that Ireland adopt a distributed model of implementation of the EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act. This approach will build on the deep knowledge and expertise of the established sectoral regulators. The designation of an initial list of eight public bodies as competent authorities, responsible for implementing and enforcing the Act within their respective sectors has been approved. These authorities are:\n- Central Bank of Ireland\n- Commission for Communications Regulation\n- Commission for Railway Regulation\n- Competition and Consumer Protection Commission\n- Data Protection Commission\n- Health and Safety Authority\n- Health Products Regulatory Authority\n- Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport\nAdditional authorities, and a lead regulator who will coordinate enforcement of the Act and provide a number of centralised functions, will be designated by a future government decision to ensure comprehensive implementation of the Act.\nPublic authorities which supervise or enforce obligations protecting fundamental rights\nArticle 77 of the AI Act requires that member states of the EU identify national public authorities which supervise or enforce the respect of obligations under Union law protecting fundamental rights, including the right to non-discrimination, in relation to certain high-risk uses of AI systems specified in the Act. Under the Act, fundamental rights are those enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection. The list of these authorities must be notified to the European Commission.\nIreland\u2019s list of fundamental rights authorities identified in accordance with Article 77 of the AI Act is as follows:\nThese authorities are not competent authorities for the Act, nor are any obligations, responsibilities or tasks assigned to them under the AI Act.\nRather, these authorities will get additional powers to facilitate them in carrying out their current mandates in circumstances involving the use of AI systems. For example, the authorities will have the power to access documentation that developers and deployers of AI systems are required to hold under the AI Act. These powers will apply from 2 August 2026.\nThis list will be kept under review by the department and updated to reflect future changes in the national authorities.\nFurther information\nAI Act - European Commission\nAI Act Q&As - European Commission\nFull text of the AI Act: Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending Regulations (EC) No 300/2008, (EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013, (EU) 2018/858, (EU) 2018/1139 and (EU) 2019/2144 and Directives 2014/90/EU, (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act)\nEuropean AI Office - European Commission\nAI literacy\nIntroduction to AI Course - increase your awareness of AI, learn about the EU AI Act and support adoption of AI in your organisation:\nSkills and training - AI for You - CeADAR\nUpdate on Article 4 on AI Literacy\nArticle 4 of the AI Act requires providers and deployers of AI systems to ensure a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing with AI systems on their behalf.\nQ&A from the AI Office provides guidance on matters relating to AI literacy\nThese pages are provided for information purposes only, and do not constitute a legal interpretation of the EU AI Act.

Phase 4 studies such as safety surveillance studies to support use in special populations, and clinical trials are performed.\nExample from hardware and system technologies\nIn hardware and system technologies, research activities (TRL1-4) aim to deliver basic technological components that work together in a low fidelity environment. Development activities/prototyping (TRL5-7) facilitate transition towards expected behavior of the future product in realistic environment. Finally, innovation activities (TRL8-9) combine production configurations with desired fully-functional product.\nThe resulted applications are mainly speculative, with no proof pf concepts to support assumptions. At this level, technology is limited to analytical studies.\nActive R&D activities, including analytical and laboratory studies to physically validate the previous analytical predictions and assumptions. the first proof of concept.\nThe resulting system integrates basic technological components that work together in a low fidelity compared with the eventual system.

High fidelity is achieved in laboratory.\nThe technology is tested in a relevant environment. It starts to be considered as a representative prototype to be tested in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment\nTechnology is proven to work in its final form and under expected operational conditions. Tests and evaluation of the system are made in its intended or pre-production configuration. Design specifications, including quality and safety conditions along with operational suitability are evaluated. At this stage pre-serial manufacturing is intended to overcome any future mass production issues.\nTechnology is shaped in its actual application, meeting production configuration and under real conditions such as those identified during operational tests and evaluation."

Council Directive 85/374/EEC (3) lays down common rules on liability for defective products with the aim of removing divergences between the legal systems of Member States that may distort competition and affect the movement of goods within the internal market. Greater harmonisation of the common rules on liability for defective products laid down in that Directive would further contribute to the achievement of those objectives, while entailing an increased degree of protection of consumers\u2019 and other natural persons\u2019 health or property. |\n|\n(2) |\nLiability without fault on the part of economic operators remains the sole means of adequately addressing the problem of fair apportionment of risk inherent in modern technological production. |\n|\n(3) |\nDirective 85/374/EEC has been an effective and important instrument, but it would need to be revised in light of developments related to new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), new circular economy business models and new global supply chains, which have led to inconsistencies and legal uncertainty, in particular as regards the meaning of the term \u2018product\u2019. Experience gained from applying that Directive has also shown that injured persons face difficulties obtaining compensation due to restrictions on making compensation claims and due to challenges in gathering evidence to prove liability, especially in light of increasing technical and scientific complexity. That includes compensation claims in respect of damage related to new technologies. The revision of that Directive would therefore encourage the roll-out and uptake of such new technologies, including AI, while ensuring that claimants enjoy the same level of protection irrespective of the technology involved and that all businesses benefit from more legal certainty and a level playing field. |\n|\n(4) |\nA revision of Directive 85/374/EEC would be needed in order to ensure coherence and consistency with product safety and market surveillance legislation at Union and national level. In addition, there is a need to clarify basic notions and concepts to ensure coherence and legal certainty and a level playing field in the internal market, and to reflect the recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. |\n|\n(5) |\nConsidering the extensive nature of the amendments that would be required in order for Directive 85/374/EEC to remain effective and in order to ensure clarity and legal certainty, that Directive should be repealed and replaced with this Directive. |\n|\n(6) |\nIn order to ensure that the Union\u2019s product liability regime is comprehensive, no-fault liability for defective products should apply to all movables, including software, including when they are integrated into other movables or installed in immovables. |\n|\n(7) |\nLiability for defective products should not apply to damage arising from nuclear accidents, in so far as liability for such damage is covered by international conventions ratified by Member States. |\n|\n(8) |\nIn order to create a genuine internal market with a high and uniform level of protection of consumers and other natural persons, and to reflect the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, Member States should not, in respect of matters within the scope of this Directive, maintain or introduce provisions that are more stringent or less stringent than those laid down in this Directive. |\n|\n(9) |\nUnder the national law of Member States, an injured person could have a claim for damages on the basis of contractual liability or on grounds of non-contractual liability that does not involve the manufacturer\u2019s liability for the defectiveness of a product as established in this Directive. This concerns for example liability based on a warranty or on fault or strict liability of operators for damage caused by the properties of an organism resulting from genetic engineering. Such national law provisions, which serve to attain, inter alia, the objective of effective protection of consumers and other natural persons, should remain unaffected by this Directive. |\n|\n(10) |\nIn certain Member States, injured persons are entitled to make claims for damage caused by pharmaceutical products under a special national liability system, with the result that effective protection of natural persons in the pharmaceutical sector is already achieved. The right to make such claims should remain unaffected by this Directive. Furthermore, amendments to such special liability systems should not be precluded as long as they do not undermine the effectiveness of the system of liability provided for in this Directive or its objectives. |\n|\n(11) |\nCompensation schemes outside the context of liability regimes, such as national health systems, social security schemes or insurance schemes, fall outside the scope of this Directive and should therefore not be precluded. For example, some Member States have schemes in place to provide compensation in respect of pharmaceutical products that cause harm without being defective. |\n|\n(12) |\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply in all sectoral product legislation. In order to ensure consistency with that Decision, certain provisions of this Directive, in particular the definitions, should be aligned therewith. |\n|\n(13) |\nProducts in the digital age can be tangible or intangible. Software, such as operating systems, firmware, computer programs, applications or AI systems, is increasingly common on the market and plays an increasingly important role for product safety. Software is capable of being placed on the market as a standalone product or can subsequently be integrated into other products as a component, and it is capable of causing damage through its execution. In the interest of legal certainty, it should be clarified in this Directive that software is a product for the purposes of applying no-fault liability, irrespective of the mode of its supply or usage, and therefore irrespective of whether the software is stored on a device, accessed through a communication network or cloud technologies, or supplied through a software-as-a-service model. Information is not, however, to be considered a product, and product liability rules should therefore not apply to the content of digital files, such as media files or e-books or the mere source code of software. A developer or producer of software, including AI system providers within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), should be treated as a manufacturer. |\n|\n(14) |\nFree and open-source software, whereby the source code is openly shared and users can freely access, use, modify and redistribute the software or modified versions thereof, can contribute to research and innovation on the market. Such software is subject to licences that allow anyone the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. In order not to hamper innovation or research, this Directive should not apply to free and open-source software developed or supplied outside the course of a commercial activity, since products so developed or supplied are by definition not placed on the market. Developing or contributing to such software should not be understood as making it available on the market. Providing such software on open repositories should not be considered as making it available on the market, unless that occurs in the course of a commercial activity. In principle, the supply of free and open-source software by non-profit organisations should not be considered as taking place in a business-related context, unless such supply occurs in the course of a commercial activity. However, where software is supplied in exchange for a price, or for personal data used other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, and is therefore supplied in the course of a commercial activity, this Directive should apply. |\n|\n(15) |\nWhere free and open-source software supplied outside the course of a commercial activity is subsequently integrated by a manufacturer as a component into a product in the course of a commercial activity and is thereby placed on the market, it should be possible to hold that manufacturer liable for damage caused by the defectiveness of such software but not the manufacturer of the software because the manufacturer of the software would not have fulfilled the conditions of placing a product or component on the market. |\n|\n(16) |\nWhereas digital files as such are not products within the scope of this Directive, digital manufacturing files, which contain the functional information necessary to produce a tangible item by enabling the automated control of machinery or tools, such as drills, lathes, mills and 3D printers, should be considered to be products in order to ensure the protection of natural persons in cases where such files are defective. For example, a defective computer-assisted-design file used to create a 3D-printed good that causes harm should give rise to liability under this Directive, where such a file is developed or supplied in the course of a commercial activity. For the avoidance of doubt, it should be clarified that raw materials, such as gas and water, and electricity are products. |\n|\n(17) |\nIt is becoming increasingly common for digital services to be integrated into, or inter-connected with, a product in such a way that the absence of the service would prevent the product from performing one of its functions. While this Directive should not apply to services as such, it is necessary to extend no-fault liability to such integrated or inter-connected digital services as they determine the safety of the product just as much as physical or digital components. Those related services should be considered components of the product into which they are integrated or with which they are inter-connected where they are within the control of the manufacturer of that product. Examples of related services include the continuous supply of traffic data in a navigation system, a health monitoring service that relies on a physical product\u2019s sensors to track the user\u2019s physical activity or health metrics, a temperature control service that monitors and regulates the temperature of a smart fridge, or a voice-assistant service that allows one or more products to be controlled by using voice commands. Internet access services should not be treated as related services, since they cannot be considered as part of a product within a manufacturer\u2019s control and it would be unreasonable to make manufacturers liable for damage caused by shortcomings in internet access services. Nevertheless, a product that relies on internet access services and fails to maintain safety in the event of a loss of connectivity could be found to be defective under this Directive. |\n|\n(18) |\nRelated services and other components, including software updates and upgrades, should be considered to be within the manufacturer\u2019s control where they are integrated into, or inter-connected with, a product, or supplied, by the manufacturer or where the manufacturer authorises or consents to their integration, inter-connection or supply by a third party, for example where the manufacturer of a smart home appliance consents to the provision by a third party of software updates for the manufacturer\u2019s appliance or where a manufacturer presents a related service or component as part of the product even though it is supplied by a third party. A manufacturer should not be considered to have consented to integration or inter-connection merely by providing for the technical possibility of integration or inter-connection or by recommending certain brands or by not prohibiting potential related services or components. |\n|\n(19) |\nOnce a product has been placed on the market, it should be considered to remain within the manufacturer\u2019s control where the manufacturer retains the ability to supply software updates or upgrades itself or via a third party. |\n|\n(20) |\nIn recognition of the growing relevance and value of intangible assets, the destruction or corruption of data, such as digital files deleted from a hard drive, should also be compensated for, including the cost of recovering or restoring those data. The protection of natural persons necessitates compensation being available for material losses resulting not only from death or personal injury, such as funeral or medical expenses or lost income, and from damage to property, but also for destruction or corruption of data. Destruction or corruption of data does not automatically result in a material loss if the victim is able to retrieve the data at no cost, such as where a back-up of the data exists or the data can be downloaded again, or an economic operator restores or recreates temporarily unavailable data, for example in a virtual environment. Destruction or corruption of data is distinct from data leaks or breaches of data protection rules, and, consequently, compensation for infringements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (6) or (EU) 2018/1725 (7) of the European Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2002/58/EC (8) or (EU) 2016/680 (9) of the European Parliament and of the Council is not affected by this Directive. |\n|\n(21) |\nIn the interest of legal certainty, this Directive should clarify that personal injury includes medically recognised and medically certified damage to psychological health that affects the victim\u2019s general state of health and could require therapy or medical treatment, taking into account, inter alia, the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization. |\n|\n(22) |\nIn line with this Directive\u2019s objective of making compensation available only to natural persons, damage to property used exclusively for professional purposes should not be compensated under this Directive. In order to address a potential risk of litigation in an excessive number of cases, the destruction or corruption of data that are used for professional purposes, even if not exclusively so, should not be compensated for under this Directive. |\n|\n(23) |\nWhile Member States should provide for full and proper compensation for all material losses resulting from death or personal injury, or from damage to or destruction of property, and destruction or corruption of data, the rules on calculating compensation should be laid down by Member States. Furthermore, compensation for non-material losses resulting from damage covered by this Directive, such as pain and suffering, should be provided in so far as such losses can be compensated for under national law. |\n|\n(24) |\nTypes of damage other than those provided for in this Directive, such as pure economic loss, privacy infringements or discrimination, should not by themselves trigger liability under this Directive. However, this Directive should not affect the right to compensation for any damage, including non-material, under other liability regimes. |\n|\n(25) |\nIn order to protect natural persons, damage to any property owned by a natural person should be compensated for. Since property is increasingly used for both private and professional purposes, it is appropriate to provide for compensation for damage to such mixed-use property. In light of this Directive\u2019s objective of protecting natural persons, property used exclusively for professional purposes should be excluded from its scope. |\n|\n(26) |\nThis Directive should apply to products placed on the market or, where relevant, put into service in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge, for example products supplied in the context of a sponsoring campaign or products manufactured for the provision of a service financed by public funds, since that mode of supply nonetheless has an economic or business character. The concept of \u2018putting into service\u2019 is relevant for products that are not placed on the market prior to their first use, as can be the case for lifts, machinery or medical devices. |\n|\n(27) |\nIn so far as national law so provides, the right to compensation for injured persons should apply both to direct victims, who suffer damage directly caused by a defective product, and to indirect victims, who suffer damage as a result of the direct victim\u2019s damage. |\n|\n(28) |\nTaking into account the increased complexity of products, of business models and of supply chains, and considering that the aim of this Directive is to ensure that consumers and other natural persons can easily exercise their right to obtain compensation in the event of damage caused by defective products, it is important that Member States ensure that competent consumer protection authorities or bodies provide all relevant information to affected consumers to enable them to effectively exercise their right to compensation in accordance with this Directive. In doing so, it is appropriate that Member States have regard to existing obligations concerning cooperation between national authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection law, in particular the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). It is important that national consumer protection authorities or bodies regularly exchange any relevant information that they become aware of and closely cooperate with market surveillance authorities. Member States can also encourage the competent consumer protection authorities or bodies to provide information to consumers to enable them better to exercise their right to compensation in accordance with this Directive effectively. |\n|\n(29) |\nThis Directive does not affect the various means of seeking redress at national level, whether through court proceedings, non-court solutions, alternative dispute resolution or representative actions under Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) or under national collective redress schemes. |\n|\n(30) |\nIn order to protect the health and property of natural persons, the defectiveness of a product should be determined by reference not to its fitness for use but to the lack of the safety that a person is entitled to expect or that is required under Union or national law. The assessment of defectiveness should involve an objective analysis of the safety that the public at large is entitled to expect and not refer to the safety that any particular person is entitled to expect. The safety that the public at large is entitled to expect should be assessed by taking into account, inter alia, the intended purpose, reasonably foreseeable use, presentation, objective characteristics and properties of the product in question, including its expected lifespan, as well as the specific requirements of the group of users for whom the product is intended. Some products, such as life-sustaining medical devices, entail an especially high risk of causing damage to people and therefore give rise to particularly high safety expectations. In order to take such expectations into account, it should be possible for a court to find that a product is defective without establishing its actual defectiveness, where it belongs to the same production series as a product already proven to be defective. |\n|\n(31) |\nThe assessment of defectiveness should take into account the presentation of the product. However, warnings or other information provided with a product cannot be considered sufficient to make an otherwise defective product safe, since defectiveness should be determined by reference to the safety that the public at large is entitled to expect. Therefore, liability under this Directive cannot be avoided simply by listing all conceivable side effects of a product. When determining the defectiveness of a product, reasonably foreseeable use also encompasses misuse that is not unreasonable under the circumstances, such as the foreseeable behaviour of a user of machinery resulting from a lack of concentration or the foreseeable behaviour of certain user groups such as children. |\n|\n(32) |\nIn order to reflect the increasing prevalence of inter-connected products, the assessment of a product\u2019s safety should take into account the reasonably foreseeable effects of other products on the product in question, for example within a smart home system. The effect on a product\u2019s safety of any ability to learn or acquire new features after it is placed on the market or put into service should also be taken into account to reflect the legitimate expectation that a product\u2019s software and underlying algorithms are designed in such a way as to prevent hazardous product behaviour. Consequently, a manufacturer that designs a product with the ability to develop unexpected behaviour should remain liable for behaviour that causes harm. In order to reflect the fact that in the digital age many products remain within the manufacturer\u2019s control after being placed on the market, the moment in time a product leaves the manufacturer\u2019s control should also be taken into account in the assessment of a product\u2019s safety. A product can also be found to be defective on account of its cybersecurity vulnerability, for example where the product does not fulfil safety-relevant cybersecurity requirements. |\n|\n(33) |\nIn order to reflect the nature of products whose very purpose is to prevent damage, such as a warning mechanism like a smoke alarm, the assessment of the defectiveness of such a product should take into account its failure to fulfil that purpose. |\n|\n(34) |\nIn order to reflect the relevance of product safety and market surveillance legislation for determining the level of safety that a person is entitled to expect, it should be clarified that relevant product safety requirements, including safety-relevant cybersecurity requirements, and interventions by competent authorities, such as issuing product recalls, or by economic operators themselves, should be taken into account in the assessment of defectiveness. Such interventions should, however, not in themselves create a presumption of defectiveness. |\n|\n(35) |\nIn the interests of consumer choice and in order to encourage innovation, research and easy access to new technologies, the existence or subsequent placing on the market of a better product should not in itself lead to the conclusion that a product is defective. Similarly, the supply of updates or upgrades for a product should not in itself lead to the conclusion that a previous version of the product is defective. |\n|\n(36) |\nThe protection of natural persons requires that any manufacturer involved in the production process can be held liable, in so far as a product or a component supplied by that manufacturer is defective. This includes any person who presents themselves as the manufacturer by putting, or authorising a third party to put, their name, trademark or other distinguishing feature on a product, since by doing so that person gives the impression of being involved in the production process or of assuming responsibility for it. Where a manufacturer integrates a defective component from another manufacturer into a product, an injured person should be able to seek compensation for the same damage both from the manufacturer of the product and from the manufacturer of the component. Where a component is integrated into a product outside the control of the manufacturer of that product, an injured person should be able to seek compensation from the component manufacturer where the component itself is a product under this Directive. |\n|\n(37) |\nIn order to ensure that injured persons have an enforceable claim for compensation where a manufacturer of a product is established outside the Union, it should be possible to hold the importer of that product and the authorised representative of the manufacturer, appointed in relation to specified tasks under Union legislation, for example under product safety and market surveillance legislation, liable. Market surveillance has shown that supply chains sometimes involve economic operators whose novel form means that they do not fit easily into traditional supply chains under the existing legal framework. Such is the case, in particular, with fulfilment service providers, which perform many of the same functions as importers but which might not always correspond to the traditional definition of importer in Union law. Fulfilment service providers play an increasingly significant role as economic operators, enabling and facilitating access to the Union market for products from third countries. That shift in relevance is already reflected in the product safety and market surveillance framework, in particular Regulations (EU) 2019/1020 (12) and (EU) 2023/988 (13) of the European Parliament and of the Council. Therefore, it should be possible to hold fulfilment service providers liable, but given the subsidiary nature of their role, they should be liable only where no importer or authorised representative is established in the Union. In the interests of channelling liability in an effective manner towards manufacturers, importers, authorised representatives and fulfilment service providers, it should be possible to hold distributors liable only where they fail to promptly identify a relevant economic operator established in the Union. |\n|\n(38) |\nOnline selling has grown consistently and steadily, creating new business models and new actors in the market, such as online platforms. Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and Regulation (EU) 2023/988 regulate, inter alia, the responsibility and accountability of online platforms with regard to illegal content, including in relation to the sale of products. When online platforms perform the role of manufacturer, importer, authorised representative, fulfilment service provider or distributor in respect of a defective product, they should be subject to the same liability as such economic operators. Where online platforms play a mere intermediary role in the sale of products between traders and consumers, they are covered by a conditional liability exemption under Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. However, Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 provides that online platforms that allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders are not exempt from liability under consumer protection law where they present the product or otherwise enable the specific transaction in question in a way that would lead an average consumer to believe that the product is provided either by the online platform itself or by a trader acting under its authority or control. In keeping with that principle, where online platforms so present the product or otherwise enable the specific transaction, it should be possible to hold them liable in the same way as distributors under this Directive. Therefore, provisions of this Directive relating to distributors should apply analogously to such online platforms. That means that such online platforms should be liable only where they present the product or otherwise enable the specific transaction in a way that would lead an average consumer to believe that the product is provided either by the online platform itself or by a trader acting under its authority or control, and only where the online platform fails to promptly identify a relevant economic operator established in the Union. |\n|\n(39) |\nIn the transition from a linear to a circular economy, products are designed to be more durable, reusable, repairable and upgradable. The Union is also promoting innovative and sustainable forms of production and consumption that prolong the functionality of products and components, such as remanufacturing, refurbishment and repair, as set out in the communication of the Commission of 11 March 2020 entitled \u2018A new Circular Economy Action Plan \u2013 For a cleaner and more competitive Europe\u2019. When a product is substantially modified and is thereafter made available on the market or put into service, it is considered to be a new product. Where the modification is made outside the control of the original manufacturer, it should be possible to hold the person that made the substantial modification liable as a manufacturer of the modified product, since under relevant Union law that person is responsible for the product\u2019s compliance with safety requirements. Whether a modification is substantial should be determined on the basis of criteria laid down in relevant Union and national product safety law, including Regulation (EU) 2023/988. Where no such criteria are laid down in respect of the product in question, modifications that change the original intended functions of the product or affect its compliance with applicable safety requirements or change its risk profile should be considered to be substantial modifications. Where a substantial modification is carried out by the original manufacturer, or within its control, and where such a substantial modification makes the product defective, that manufacturer should not be able to avoid liability by arguing that the defectiveness came into being after it placed the product on the market or put it into service. In the interests of a fair apportionment of risk in the circular economy, an economic operator that makes a substantial modification, other than the original manufacturer, should be exempted from liability if that economic operator can prove that the damage is related to a part of the product not affected by the modification. Economic operators that carry out repairs or other operations that do not involve substantial modifications should not be subject to liability under this Directive. |\n|\n(40) |\nSince products can be designed in a manner that allows modifications to be made through changes to software, including upgrades, the same principles should apply to modifications made by way of a software update or upgrade as apply to modifications made in other ways. Where a substantial modification is made through a software update or upgrade, or due to the continuous learning of an AI system, the substantially modified product should be considered to be made available on the market or put into service at the time that modification is actually made. |\n|\n(41) |\nWhere victims fail to obtain compensation because no person is held liable under this Directive or because the liable persons are insolvent or have ceased to exist, Member States can use existing national sectoral compensation schemes or establish new ones under national law to appropriately compensate injured persons who suffered damage caused by defective products. It is for Member States to decide whether such compensation schemes are funded in whole or in part from public or private revenue. |\n|\n(42) |\nIn light of the imposition on economic operators of liability irrespective of fault, and with a view to achieving a fair apportionment of risk, a person that claims compensation for damage caused by a defective product should bear the burden of proving the damage, the defectiveness of a product and the causal link between the two, in accordance with the standard of proof applicable under national law. Persons claiming compensation for damage are, however, often at a significant disadvantage compared to manufacturers in terms of access to, and understanding of, information on how a product was produced and how it operates. That asymmetry of information can undermine the fair apportionment of risk, in particular in cases involving technical or scientific complexity. It is therefore necessary to facilitate claimants\u2019 access to evidence to be used in legal proceedings. Such evidence includes documents that have to be created ex novo by the defendant by compiling or classifying the available evidence. In assessing the request for disclosure of evidence, national courts should ensure that such access is limited to that which is necessary and proportionate, inter alia, to avoid non-specific searches for information that is not relevant to the proceedings and to protect confidential information, such as information falling within the scope of legal professional privilege and trade secrets in accordance with Union and national law, in particular Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). Taking into consideration the complexity of certain types of evidence, for example evidence relating to digital products, it should be possible for national courts to require such evidence to be presented in an easily accessible and easily understandable manner, subject to certain conditions. |\n|\n(43) |\nThis Directive harmonises rules on disclosure of evidence only in so far as such matters are regulated by it. Matters not regulated by this Directive include rules on disclosure of evidence with regard to: pre-trial procedures; how specific a request for evidence must be; third parties; cases of declaratory actions; and sanctions for non-compliance with the obligation to disclose evidence. |\n|\n(44) |\nIn light of the fact that defendants might need access to evidence at the disposal of the claimant in order to counter a claim for compensation under this Directive, defendants should also have the possibility of accessing evidence. Similar to a disclosure request made by the claimant, when assessing the request of the defendant for disclosure of evidence, national courts should ensure that such access is limited to that which is necessary and proportionate, inter alia, to avoid non-specific searches for information that is not relevant to the proceedings and to protect confidential information. |\n|\n(45) |\nIn respect of trade secrets as defined in Directive (EU) 2016/943, national courts should be empowered to take specific measures to ensure the confidentiality of trade secrets during and after the proceedings, while achieving a fair and proportionate balance between the interests of the trade secret holder with regard to secrecy and the interests of the injured person. Such measures should include at least measures to restrict access to documents containing trade secrets or alleged trade secrets and to restrict access to hearings to a limited number of people, or allowing access only to redacted documents or transcripts of hearings. When deciding on such measures, it is appropriate that national courts take into account the need to ensure the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the legitimate interests of the parties and, where appropriate, of third parties, and potential harm for either of the parties to a dispute, and, where appropriate, for third parties, which results from the granting or rejection of such measures. |\n|\n(46) |\nIt is necessary to alleviate the claimant\u2019s burden of proof provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. Rebuttable presumptions of fact are a common mechanism for alleviating a claimant\u2019s evidential difficulties and allowing a court to base the existence of defectiveness or of a causal link on the presence of another fact that has been proven while preserving the rights of the defendant. In order to provide an incentive to comply with the obligation to disclose information, national courts should presume the defectiveness of a product where a defendant fails to comply with such an obligation. Many mandatory safety requirements have been adopted in order to protect consumers and other natural persons from the risk of harm, including under Regulation (EU) 2023/988. In order to reinforce the close relationship between product safety rules and liability rules, non-compliance with such requirements should also result in a presumption of defectiveness. That includes cases in which a product is not equipped with the means to log information about the operation of the product as required under Union or national law. The same should apply in the case of obvious malfunction, such as a glass bottle that explodes in the course of reasonably foreseeable use, since it is unnecessarily burdensome to require a claimant to prove defectiveness when the circumstances are such that its existence is undisputed. Reasonably foreseeable use covers the use for which a product is intended in accordance with the information provided by the manufacturer or economic operator placing it on the market, the ordinary use as determined by the design and construction of the product, and use which can be reasonably foreseen where such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour. |\n|\n(47) |\nWhere it has been established that a product is defective and the kind of damage that occurred is, based primarily on similar cases, typically caused by the defectiveness in question, the claimant should not be required to prove the causal link and its existence should be presumed. |\n|\n(48) |\nNational courts should presume the defectiveness of a product or the causal link between the damage and the defectiveness, or both, where, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s disclosure of information, it would be excessively difficult for the claimant, in particular due to the technical or scientific complexity of the case, to prove the defectiveness or the causal link, or both. They should do so taking into account all the circumstances of the case. In such cases, imposing the usual standard of proof as required under national law, which often calls for a high degree of probability, would undermine the effectiveness of the right to compensation. Therefore, given that manufacturers have expert knowledge and are better informed than the injured person, and in order to maintain a fair apportionment of risk while avoiding a reversal of the burden of proof, that claimant should be required to demonstrate, where the claimant\u2019s difficulties relate to proving defectiveness, only that it is likely that the product was defective, or, where the claimant\u2019s difficulties relate to proving the causal link, only that the defectiveness of the product is a likely cause of the damage. Technical or scientific complexity should be determined by national courts on a case-by-case basis, taking into account various factors. Those factors should include the complex nature of the product, such as an innovative medical device; the complex nature of the technology used, such as machine learning; the complex nature of the information and data to be analysed by the claimant; and the complex nature of the causal link, such as a link between a pharmaceutical or food product and the onset of a health condition or a link that, in order to be proven, would require the claimant to explain the inner workings of an AI system. The assessment of excessive difficulties should also be made by national courts on a case-by-case basis. While a claimant should provide arguments to demonstrate excessive difficulties, proof of such difficulties should not be required. For example, in a claim concerning an AI system, the claimant should, for the court to decide that excessive difficulties exist, neither be required to explain the AI system\u2019s specific characteristics nor how those characteristics make it harder to establish the causal link. The defendant should have the possibility of contesting all elements of the claim, including the existence of excessive difficulties. |\n|\n(49) |\nIn the interest of a fair apportionment of risk, economic operators should be exempted from liability if they can prove the existence of specific exonerating circumstances. They should not be liable where they can prove that a person other than themselves caused the product to leave the manufacturing process against their will or that compliance with legal requirements was precisely the reason for the product\u2019s defectiveness. |\n|\n(50) |\nThe moment of placing on the market or putting into service is normally the moment when a product leaves the control of the manufacturer, while for distributors it is the moment when they make the product available on the market. Manufacturers should therefore be exempted from liability where they prove that it is probable that the defectiveness that caused the damage did not exist when they placed the product on the market or put it into service or that the defectiveness came into being after that moment. However, since digital technologies allow manufacturers to exercise control beyond the moment of placing the product on the market or putting into service, manufacturers should remain liable for defectiveness that comes into being after that moment as a result of software or related services within their control, be it in the form of updates or upgrades or machine-learning algorithms. Such software or related services should be considered to be within the manufacturer\u2019s control where they are supplied by that manufacturer or where that manufacturer authorises them or otherwise consents to their supply by a third party. For example, if a smart television is presented as including a video application, but the user is required to download the application from a third party\u2019s website after the purchase of the television, the television manufacturer should remain liable, alongside the manufacturer of the video application, for damage caused by any defectiveness of the video application, even though the defectiveness came into being only after the television was placed on the market. |\n|\n(51) |\nThe possibility for economic operators to avoid liability by proving that the defectiveness came into being after they placed the product on the market or put it into service should be restricted when a product\u2019s defectiveness consists in the lack of software updates or upgrades necessary to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities and maintain the safety of the product. Such vulnerabilities can affect the product in such a way that it causes damage within the meaning of this Directive. In recognition of manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities under Union law for the safety of products throughout their lifecycle, such as under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), manufacturers should also not be exempted from liability for damage caused by their defective products when the defectiveness results from their failure to supply the software security updates or upgrades that are necessary to address those products\u2019 vulnerabilities in response to evolving cybersecurity risks. Such liability should not apply where the supply or installation of such software is beyond the manufacturer\u2019s control, for example where the owner of the product does not install an update or upgrade supplied for the purpose of ensuring or maintaining the level of safety of the product. This Directive does not impose any obligation to provide updates or upgrades for a product. |\n|\n(52) |\nIn the interests of a fair apportionment of risk, economic operators should be exempted from liability if they prove that the state of scientific and technical knowledge, determined with reference to the most advanced level of objective knowledge accessible and not to the actual knowledge of the economic operator in question, during the period in which the product was within the manufacturer\u2019s control, was such that the existence of the defectiveness could not be discovered. |\n|\n(53) |\nSituations can arise in which two or more parties are liable for the same damage, in particular where a defective component is integrated into a product that causes damage. In such a case, the injured person should be able to seek compensation both from the manufacturer that integrated the defective component into its product and from the manufacturer of the defective component itself. In order to ensure the protection of natural persons, all parties should be held liable jointly and severally in such situations. |\n|\n(54) |\nA high degree of innovation is particularly necessary in the software sector. With a view to supporting the innovative capacity of microenterprises and small enterprises that manufacture software, it should be possible for such enterprises to contractually agree with manufacturers that integrate their software into a product that the latter will not seek recourse from the software manufacturer in the event of a defective software component causing harm. Such contractual agreements, already used in some Member States, should be allowed, since the manufacturer of the product as a whole is in any event liable for any defectiveness in the product, including in components. However, liability towards an injured person should never be limited or excluded by such a contractual agreement. |\n|\n(55) |\nSituations can arise in which the acts and omissions of a person other than a potentially liable economic operator contribute, in addition to the defectiveness of the product, to the cause of the damage suffered, such as a third party exploiting a cybersecurity vulnerability of a product. In the interests of consumer protection, where a product is defective, for example due to a vulnerability that makes the product less safe than the public at large is entitled to expect, the liability of the economic operator should not be reduced or disallowed as a result of such acts or omissions by a third party. However, it should be possible to reduce or disallow the economic operator\u2019s liability where injured persons themselves have negligently contributed to the cause of the damage, for example where the injured person negligently failed to install updates or upgrades provided by the economic operator that would have mitigated or avoided the damage. |\n|\n(56) |\nThe objective of protecting natural persons would be undermined if it were possible to limit or exclude an economic operator\u2019s liability through contractual provisions. Therefore no contractual derogations should be permitted. For the same reason, it should not be possible for provisions of national law to limit or exclude liability, such as by setting financial ceilings on an economic operator\u2019s liability. |\n|\n(57) |\nGiven that products age over time and that higher safety standards are developed as the state of science and technology progresses, it would not be reasonable to make manufacturers liable for an unlimited period of time for the defectiveness of their products. Therefore, liability should be subject to a reasonable length of time, namely 10 years from the placing on the market or putting into service of a product (the \u2018expiry period\u2019), without prejudice to claims pending in legal proceedings. In order to avoid unreasonably restricting the possibility of compensation for damage caused by a defective product, the expiry period should be extended to 25 years in cases where the symptoms of a personal injury are, according to medical evidence, slow to emerge. |\n|\n(58) |\nSince substantially modified products are essentially new products, a new expiry period should start to run after a product has been substantially modified and has subsequently been made available on the market or put into service, for example as a result of remanufacturing. Updates or upgrades that do not amount to a substantial modification of the product should not affect the expiry period that applies to the original product. |\n|\n(59) |\nThe possibility provided for in this Directive whereby an economic operator that proves that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when a product was placed on the market or put into service or during the period in which the product was within the manufacturer\u2019s control was not such as to enable the existence of a defect to be discovered can avoid liability, the so-called \u2018development risk defence\u2019, could be deemed in certain Member States to limit unduly the protection of natural persons. It should therefore be possible for a Member State to derogate from that possibility by introducing new measures, or amending existing measures, to extend liability in such situations to specific types of products if it is deemed necessary, proportionate and justified by public interest objectives, such as those set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, namely public policy, public security and public health. To ensure transparency and legal certainty for economic operators operating across the Union, the use of such a derogation from the development risk defence should be notified to the Commission, which should then inform the other Member States. In order to facilitate a coherent approach across Member States and consistency with the objectives of this Directive, the Commission should be able to issue non-binding opinions on the proposed measures or amendments. In order to allow time for the issuing of an opinion, a Member State proposing such measures or amendments should hold the proposed measures or amendments in abeyance for six months following their notification to the Commission, unless the Commission issues an opinion earlier. Such an opinion should be issued after close cooperation between the Member State concerned and the Commission, taking into account the views of other Member States, if any. In the interest of legal certainty and to facilitate continuity of arrangements established under Directive 85/374/EEC, it should also be possible for a Member State to maintain existing derogations from the development risk defence in its legal system. |\n|\n(60) |\nIn order to facilitate the harmonised interpretation of this Directive by national courts, Member States should be required to publish final court judgments on product liability under this Directive, meaning those judgments that cannot be, or can no longer be, appealed. In order to limit the administrative burden, Member States should be required only to publish judgments of national courts of appeal or of the highest instance. |\n|\n(61) |\nTo increase the understanding of how this Directive is applied at national level, for the benefit of, inter alia, the public, legal practitioners, academics and Member States, the Commission should set up and maintain an easily accessible and publicly available database containing the relevant judgments as well as references to relevant judgments delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union. |\n|\n(62) |\nThe Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Directive. Pursuant to paragraph 22 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (17), that evaluation should be based on the five criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and value added and should provide the basis for impact assessments of possible further measures. In its evaluation report, the Commission should provide the methodology for the calculations used in its evaluation. It is important that the Commission gather all relevant information in a way that avoids overregulation and an administrative burden for Member States and economic operators, using information from all relevant and reliable sources, including Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, national competent authorities and internationally recognised bodies and organisations. |\n|\n(63) |\nFor reasons of legal certainty, this Directive does not apply to products placed on the market or put into service before 9 December 2026. It is therefore necessary to provide for transitional arrangements in order to ensure continued liability under Directive 85/374/EEC for damage caused by defective products which have been placed on the market or put into service before that date. |\n|\n(64) |\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely to ensure the functioning of the internal market, undistorted competition and a high level of protection for natural persons, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the Union-wide nature of the market in goods but can rather, by reason of the harmonising effect of common rules on liability, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, |\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and objective\nThis Directive lays down common rules on the liability of economic operators for damage suffered by natural persons and caused by defective products, and on compensation for such damage.\nThe objective of this Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market while ensuring a high level of protection of consumers and other natural persons.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

The right to compensation shall also cover non-material losses resulting from the damage referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in so far as they can be compensated for under national law.\n3. This Article does not affect national law relating to compensation for damage under other liability regimes.\nArticle 7\nDefectiveness\n1. A product shall be considered defective where it does not provide the safety that a person is entitled to expect or that is required under Union or national law.\n2. In assessing the defectiveness of a product, all circumstances shall be taken into account, including:\n|\n(a) |\nthe presentation and the characteristics of the product, including its labelling, design, technical features, composition and packaging and the instructions for its assembly, installation, use and maintenance; |\n|\n(b) |\nreasonably foreseeable use of the product; |\n|\n(c) |\nthe effect on the product of any ability to continue to learn or acquire new features after it is placed on the market or put into service; |\n|\n(d) |\nthe reasonably foreseeable effect on the product of other products that can be expected to be used together with the product, including by means of inter-connection; |\n|\n(e) |\nthe moment in time when the product was placed on the market or put into service or, where the manufacturer retains control over the product after that moment, the moment in time when the product left the control of the manufacturer; |\n|\n(f) |\nrelevant product safety requirements, including safety-relevant cybersecurity requirements; |\n|\n(g) |\nany recall of the product or any other relevant intervention relating to product safety by a competent authority or by an economic operator as referred to in Article 8; |\n|\n(h) |\nthe specific needs of the group of users for whose use the product is intended; |\n|\n(i) |\nin the case of a product whose very purpose is to prevent damage, any failure of the product to fulfil that purpose. |\n3. A product shall not be considered to be defective for the sole reason that a better product, including updates or upgrades for a product, has already been or is subsequently placed on the market or put into service.\nArticle 8\nEconomic operators liable for defective products\n1. Member States shall ensure that the following economic operators are liable for damage in accordance with this Directive:\n|\n(a) |\nthe manufacturer of a defective product; |\n|\n(b) |\nthe manufacturer of a defective component, where that component was integrated into, or inter-connected with, a product within the manufacturer\u2019s control and caused that product to be defective, and without prejudice to the liability of the manufacturer referred to in point (a); and |\n|\n(c) |\nin the case of a manufacturer of a product or a component established outside the Union, and without prejudice to the liability of that manufacturer:\n|\nThe liability of the manufacturer referred to in the first subparagraph, point (a), shall also cover any damage caused by a defective component where it was integrated into, or inter-connected with, a product within that manufacturer\u2019s control.\n2. Any natural or legal person that substantially modifies a product outside the manufacturer\u2019s control and thereafter makes it available on the market or puts it into service shall be considered to be a manufacturer of that product for the purposes of paragraph 1.\n3. Member States shall ensure that, where an economic operator from among those referred to in paragraph 1 and established in the Union cannot be identified, each distributor of the defective product is liable where:\n|\n(a) |\nthe injured person requests that distributor to identify an economic operator from among those referred to in paragraph 1 and established in the Union, or its own distributor that supplied it with that product; and |\n|\n(b) |\nthat distributor fails to identify an economic operator or its own distributor, as referred to in point (a), within one month of receiving the request referred to in point (a). |\n4. Paragraph 3 of this Article shall also apply to any provider of an online platform that allows consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders and that is not an economic operator, provided that the conditions set out in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 are fulfilled.\n5. Where victims fail to obtain compensation because none of the persons referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 can be held liable under this Directive, or because the liable persons are insolvent or have ceased to exist, Member States may use existing national sectoral compensation schemes or establish new ones under national law, preferably not funded by public revenue, to appropriately compensate injured persons who have suffered damage caused by defective products.\nArticle 9\nDisclosure of evidence\n1. Member States shall ensure that, at the request of a person who is claiming compensation in proceedings before a national court for damage caused by a defective product (the \u2018claimant\u2019) and who has presented facts and evidence sufficient to support the plausibility of the claim for compensation, the defendant is required to disclose relevant evidence that is at the defendant\u2019s disposal, subject to the conditions set out in this Article.\n2. Member States shall ensure that, at the request of a defendant that has presented facts and evidence sufficient to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s need for evidence for the purposes of countering a claim for compensation, the claimant is required, in accordance with national law, to disclose relevant evidence that is at the claimant\u2019s disposal.\n3. Member States shall ensure that the disclosure of evidence pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2, and in accordance with national law, is limited to what is necessary and proportionate.\n4. Member States shall ensure that, when determining whether the disclosure of evidence requested by a party is necessary and proportionate, national courts consider the legitimate interests of all parties concerned, including third parties, in particular in relation to the protection of confidential information and trade secrets.\n5. Member States shall ensure that, where a defendant is required to disclose information that is a trade secret or an alleged trade secret, national courts are empowered, upon a duly reasoned request of a party or on their own initiative, to take the specific measures necessary to preserve the confidentiality of that information when it is used or referred to in the course of or after the legal proceedings.\n6. Member States shall ensure that, where a party is required to disclose evidence, national courts are empowered, upon a duly reasoned request of the opposing party or where the national court concerned deems it appropriate and in accordance with national law, to require such evidence to be presented in an easily accessible and easily understandable manner, if such presentation is deemed proportionate by the national court in terms of costs and effort for the required party.\n7. This Article does not affect national rules relating to the pre-trial disclosure of evidence, where such rules exist.\nArticle 10\nBurden of proof\n1. Member States shall ensure that a claimant is required to prove the defectiveness of the product, the damage suffered and the causal link between that defectiveness and that damage.\n2. The defectiveness of the product shall be presumed where any of the following conditions are met:\n|\n(a) |\nthe defendant fails to disclose relevant evidence pursuant to Article 9(1); |\n|\n(b) |\nthe claimant demonstrates that the product does not comply with mandatory product safety requirements laid down in Union or national law that are intended to protect against the risk of the damage suffered by the injured person; or |\n|\n(c) |\nthe claimant demonstrates that the damage was caused by an obvious malfunction of the product during reasonably foreseeable use or under ordinary circumstances. |\n3. The causal link between the defectiveness of the product and the damage shall be presumed where it has been established that the product is defective and that the damage caused is of a kind typically consistent with the defect in question.\n4. A national court shall presume the defectiveness of the product or the causal link between its defectiveness and the damage, or both, where, despite the disclosure of evidence in accordance with Article 9 and taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case:\n|\n(a) |\nthe claimant faces excessive difficulties, in particular due to technical or scientific complexity, in proving the defectiveness of the product or the causal link between its defectiveness and the damage, or both; and |\n|\n(b) |\nthe claimant demonstrates that it is likely that the product is defective or that there is a causal link between the defectiveness of the product and the damage, or both. |\n5. The defendant shall have the right to rebut any of the presumptions referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.\nArticle 11\nExemption from liability\n1. An economic operator as referred to in Article 8 shall not be liable for damage caused by a defective product if that economic operator proves any of the following:\n|\n(a) |\nin the case of a manufacturer or importer, that it did not place the product on the market or put it into service; |\n|\n(b) |\nin the case of a distributor, that it did not make the product available on the market; |\n|\n(c) |\nthat it is probable that the defectiveness that caused the damage did not exist at the time the product was placed on the market, put into service or, in the case of a distributor, made available on the market, or that that defectiveness came into being after that moment; |\n|\n(d) |\nthat the defectiveness that caused the damage is due to compliance of the product with legal requirements; |\n|\n(e) |\nthat the objective state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time the product was placed on the market or put into service or during the period in which the product was within the manufacturer\u2019s control was not such that the defectiveness could be discovered; |\n|\n(f) |\nin the case of a manufacturer of a defective component, as referred to in Article 8(1), first subparagraph, point (b), that the defectiveness of the product in which that component has been integrated is attributable to the design of that product or to the instructions given by the manufacturer of that product to the manufacturer of that component; |\n|\n(g) |\nin the case of a person that modifies a product as referred to in Article 8(2), that the defectiveness that caused the damage is related to a part of the product not affected by the modification. |\n2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, point (c), an economic operator shall not be exempted from liability where the defectiveness of a product is due to any of the following, provided that it is within the manufacturer\u2019s control:\n|\n(a) |\na related service; |\n|\n(b) |\nsoftware, including software updates or upgrades; |\n|\n(c) |\na lack of software updates or upgrades necessary to maintain safety; |\n|\n(d) |\na substantial modification of the product. |\nCHAPTER III\nGENERAL PROVISIONS ON LIABILITY\nArticle 12\nLiability of multiple economic operators\n1. Without prejudice to national law concerning rights of contribution or recourse, Member States shall ensure that where two or more economic operators are liable for the same damage pursuant to this Directive, they can be held liable jointly and severally.\n2. A manufacturer that integrates software as a component in a product shall not have a right of recourse against the manufacturer of a defective software component that causes damage where:\n|\n(a) |\nthe manufacturer of the defective software component was, at the time of the placing on the market of that software component, a microenterprise or a small enterprise, meaning an enterprise that, when assessed together with all of its partner enterprises as defined in Article 3(2) of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (21) and linked enterprises as defined in Article 3(3) of that Annex, if any, is a microenterprise as defined in Article 2(3) of that Annex or a small enterprise as defined in Article 2(2) of that Annex; and |\n|\n(b) |\nthe manufacturer that integrated the defective software component in the product contractually agreed with the manufacturer of the defective software component to waive that right. |\nArticle 13\nReduction of liability\n1. Without prejudice to national law concerning rights of contribution or recourse, Member States shall ensure that the liability of an economic operator is not reduced or disallowed where the damage is caused both by the defectiveness of a product and by an act or omission of a third party.\n2. The liability of an economic operator may be reduced or disallowed where the damage is caused both by the defectiveness of the product and by the fault of the injured person or any person for whom the injured person is responsible.\nArticle 14\nRight of recourse\nWhere more than one economic operator is liable for the same damage, an economic operator that has compensated the injured person shall be entitled to pursue remedies against other economic operators liable pursuant to Article 8 in accordance with national law.\nArticle 15\nExclusion or limitation of liability\nMember States shall ensure that the liability of an economic operator pursuant to this Directive is not, in relation to the injured person, limited or excluded by a contractual provision or by national law.\nArticle 16\nLimitation period\n1. Member States shall ensure that a limitation period of three years applies to the initiation of proceedings to claim compensation for damage falling within the scope of this Directive. The limitation period shall run from the day on which the injured person became aware, or should reasonably have become aware, of all of the following:\n|\n(a) |\nthe damage; |\n|\n(b) |\nthe defectiveness; |\n|\n(c) |\nthe identity of the relevant economic operator that can be held liable for that damage under Article 8. |\n2. National law regulating the suspension or interruption of the limitation period referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be affected by this Directive.\nArticle 17\nExpiry period\n1. Member States shall ensure that an injured person is no longer entitled to compensation pursuant to this Directive upon the expiry of a period of 10 years, unless that injured person has, in the meantime, initiated proceedings against an economic operator that can be held liable pursuant to Article 8. That period shall run from:\n|\n(a) |\nthe date on which the defective product which caused the damage was placed on the market or put into service; or |\n|\n(b) |\nin the case of a substantially modified product, the date on which that product was made available on the market or put into service following its substantial modification. |\n2. By way of exception from paragraph 1, where an injured person has not been able to initiate proceedings within 10 years of the dates referred to in paragraph 1 due to the latency of a personal injury, the injured person shall no longer be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Directive upon the expiry of a period of 25 years, unless that injured person has, in the meantime, initiated proceedings against an economic operator that can be held liable pursuant to Article 8.\nCHAPTER IV\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 18\nDerogation from development risk defence\n1. Member States may, by way of derogation from Article 11(1), point (e), maintain in their legal systems existing measures whereby economic operators are liable even if they prove that the objective state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time the product was placed on the market or put into service or during the period in which the product was within the manufacturer\u2019s control was not such that the defectiveness could be discovered.\nAny Member State wishing to maintain measures in accordance with this paragraph shall notify the text of the measures to the Commission no later than 9 December 2026. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof.\n2. Member States may, by way of derogation from Article 11(1), point (e), introduce or amend in their legal systems measures whereby economic operators are liable even if they prove that the objective state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time the product was placed on the market or put into service or during the period in which the product was within the manufacturer\u2019s control was not such that the defectiveness could be discovered.\n3. The measures referred to in paragraph 2 shall be:\n|\n(a) |\nlimited to specific categories of products; |\n|\n(b) |\njustified by public interest objectives; and |\n|\n(c) |\nproportionate in that they are suitable for securing the attainment of the objectives pursued and do not go beyond what is necessary to attain those objectives. |\n4. Any Member State wishing to introduce or amend a measure referred to in paragraph 2 shall notify the text of the proposed measure to the Commission and shall provide a justification of how that measure complies with paragraph 3. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof.\n5. The Commission may, within six months of receiving a notification pursuant to paragraph 4, issue an opinion on the text of the proposed measure and the justification for that measure, taking into account any observations received from other Member States. The Member State wishing to introduce or amend that measure shall hold that measure in abeyance for six months following its notification to the Commission, unless the Commission issues its opinion earlier.\nArticle 19\nTransparency\n1. Member States shall publish, in an easily accessible and electronic format, any final judgment delivered by their national courts of appeal or of the highest instance in proceedings launched pursuant to this Directive. The publication of such a judgment shall be carried out in accordance with national law.\n2. The Commission shall set up and maintain an easily accessible and publicly available database containing the judgments referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 20\nEvaluation\nThe Commission shall by 9 December 2030, and every five years thereafter, evaluate the application of this Directive and submit a report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the European Economic and Social Committee. Those reports shall include information about the cost and benefits of the transposition of this Directive, a comparison with OECD countries and the availability of product liability insurance.\nArticle 21\nRepeal and transitional provision\nDirective 85/374/EEC is repealed with effect from 9 December 2026. However, it shall continue to apply with regard to products placed on the market or put into service before that date.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table set out in the Annex.\nArticle 22\nTransposition\n1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 9 December 2026. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt those measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by the Member States.\n2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main measures of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\nArticle 23\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 24\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 23 October 2024.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nR.

The social cost of the large number of accidents caused directly by the use of machinery can be reduced by inherently safe design and construction of machinery and by proper installation and maintenance. |\n|\n(3) |\nExperience with the application of Directive 2006/42/EC has shown inadequacies and inconsistencies in the product coverage and conformity assessment procedures. It is therefore necessary to improve, simplify and adapt the provisions set out in that Directive to the needs of the market and provide clear rules in relation to the framework within which products within the scope of this Regulation may be made available on the market. |\n|\n(4) |\nSince the rules setting out the requirements for products within the scope of this Regulation, in particular the essential health and safety requirements and the conformity assessment procedures, need to be of uniform application for all operators across the Union, and not give room for divergent implementation by Member States, Directive 2006/42/EC should be replaced by a regulation. |\n|\n(5) |\nMember States are responsible for protecting, on their territory, the health and safety of persons, in particular workers and consumers, and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, for protecting the environment, notably in relation to the risks arising out of the intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse of machinery or related products. For the avoidance of doubt, domestic animals should be considered to include farm animals. |\n|\n(6) |\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, and the general principles of the CE marking. That Regulation should be applicable to products within the scope of this Regulation in order to ensure that those products, which are benefiting from the free movement of goods within the Union, fulfil requirements providing for a high level of protection of public interests such as the protection of the health and safety of persons and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, of the environment. |\n|\n(7) |\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) sets out rules on market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market. As Directive 2006/42/EC is listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, that Regulation already applies to products within the scope of this Regulation. However, Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 applies to products within the scope of this Regulation insofar as there are no specific provisions with the same objective, which regulate in a more specific manner particular aspects of market surveillance and enforcement. |\n|\n(8) |\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 lays down the tasks of economic operators regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation. It also provides that such products are to be placed on the market only if there is an economic operator established in the Union who is responsible for those tasks. That Union harmonisation legislation includes Directive 2006/42/EC. As a result, products within the scope of this Regulation are to be placed on the market only if there is an economic operator established in the Union who is responsible for the tasks set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 in respect of those products. |\n|\n(9) |\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation. In order to ensure consistency with other sectoral product legislation, it is appropriate to align certain provisions of this Regulation to that Decision, insofar as sectoral specificities do not require a different solution. Therefore, certain definitions, the general obligations of economic operators, the rules on presumption of conformity, the rules on EU declaration of conformity, the rules on CE marking, the requirements for conformity assessment bodies, the rules on notification procedures and conformity assessment procedures and the rules on procedures to deal with machinery or related products, and, where applicable, with partly completed machinery, presenting a risk should be adapted to the reference provisions laid down in that Decision. |\n|\n(10) |\nThis Regulation should cover products which are new to the Union market when placed on the market, and are either new products made by a manufacturer established in the Union or products, whether new or second-hand, imported from a third country. |\n|\n(11) |\nWhere there is a possibility that machinery or related products will be used by a consumer, that is to say, a non-professional user, the manufacturer should take account of the fact that the consumer does not have the same knowledge of and experience in handling machinery or related products in the design and construction of the products. The same applies where the machinery or related product is normally used to provide a service to a consumer. |\n|\n(12) |\nRecently, more advanced machinery, which is less dependent on human operators, has been introduced on the market. Such machinery is working on defined tasks and in structured environments, yet it can learn to perform new actions in this context and become more autonomous. Further refinements to machinery, already in place or to be expected, include real-time processing of information, problem solving, mobility, sensor systems, learning, adaptability, and capability of operating in unstructured environments (for example construction sites). The Commission Report on the safety and liability implications of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things and Robotics of 19 February 2020, states that the emergence of new digital technologies, like artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and robotics, raises new challenges in terms of product safety. The report concludes that the current product safety legislation, including Directive 2006/42/EC, contains a number of gaps in this respect that need to be addressed. Thus, this Regulation should cover the safety risks stemming from new digital technologies. |\n|\n(13) |\nIn order to ensure protection of the health and safety of persons, and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, of the environment, this Regulation should apply to all forms of supply of products within the scope of this Regulation, including distance selling as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. |\n|\n(14) |\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, the scope of this Regulation should be set out in a clear manner and the concepts relating to its application should be defined as precisely as possible. |\n|\n(15) |\nIn order to ensure that the scope of this Regulation is sufficiently clear, a distinction should be made between machinery, related products and partly completed machinery. Moreover, related products should be understood as comprising interchangeable equipment, safety components, lifting accessories, chains, ropes and webbing, and removable mechanical transmission devices, which are all products within the scope of this Regulation. |\n|\n(16) |\nIn order to avoid legislating twice on the same product, it is appropriate to exclude from the scope of this Regulation weapons, including firearms, that are subject to Directive (EU) 2021/555 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). |\n|\n(17) |\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to address the risks stemming from machinery function and not from the transport of goods, persons or animals. Consequently, this Regulation should not apply to means of transport by air, on water and on rail networks although it should still apply to the machinery mounted on those means of transport. Means of transport by road that are not yet covered by a specific Union legal act should be regulated by this Regulation except in respect of risks that might arise from circulation on public roads. This means that vehicles, including e-bikes, e-scooters and other personal mobility devices that are not subject to EU type approval under Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) or Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) or approval under Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) are covered by this Regulation. |\n|\n(18) |\nHousehold appliances intended for domestic use which are not electrically operated furniture, audio and video equipment, information technology equipment, office machinery, low-voltage switchgear and control gear and electric motors fall within the scope of Directive 2014/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. Some of those products, for example washing machines, are progressively incorporating Wi-Fi functions and are therefore covered by Directive 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) as radio equipment. Those products should also be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. |\n|\n(19) |\nThe evolution of the machinery sector has resulted in the growing use of digital means and software plays a more and more important role in machinery design. Consequently, the definition of machinery should be adapted. In this respect, machinery missing only the upload of software intended for the specific application foreseen by the manufacturer, and which is the subject of the conformity assessment procedure of the machinery, should fall under the definition of machinery and not under the definitions of related products or partly completed machinery. Furthermore, the definition of safety components should cover not only physical devices but also digital devices. In order to take into account the increasing use of software as a safety component, software that performs a safety function and which is placed independently on the market should be considered a safety component. |\n|\n(20) |\nConsidering their critical protective function, certain components included in the indicative list of safety components in Annex II should also be subject to specific conformity assessment procedures and included in Annex I. |\n|\n(21) |\nPartly completed machinery is a product within the scope of this Regulation which needs to undergo further construction in order to be able to perform its specific application, namely the well-defined operations for which the product is designed. It is not necessary that all requirements of this Regulation apply to partly completed machinery but, in order to ensure the safety of the product as a whole, it is nevertheless important that the free movement of such partly completed machinery be guaranteed by means of a specific procedure. |\n|\n(22) |\nWhere products within the scope of this Regulation present risks that are addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in this Regulation but which are also wholly or partly covered by more specific Union harmonisation legislation than this Regulation, this Regulation should not apply to the extent that those risks are covered by that other Union legislation. In other cases, products within the scope of this Regulation might present risks that are not covered by the essential health and safety requirements set out in this Regulation. For example, products incorporating a Wi-Fi function might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in this Regulation, as this Regulation does not deal with risks specific to such Wi-Fi function. |\n|\n(23) |\nFor trade fairs, exhibitions and demonstrations or similar events, it should be possible to display products within the scope of this Regulation which do not meet the requirements of this Regulation, since this would not present any safety risk. However, for the sake of transparency, interested parties should be properly informed that the products within the scope of this Regulation are not compliant and cannot be purchased. |\n|\n(24) |\nThe evolution of the state of the art in the machinery sector has an impact on the classification of categories of machinery or related products listed in Annex I. With a view to properly reflecting any categories of machinery or related products presenting a higher risk factor, criteria should be established for the assessment of categories of products which should be included in the list of categories of machinery or related products subject to a stricter conformity assessment procedure. |\n|\n(25) |\nOther risks related to new digital technologies are those provoked by malicious third parties that have an impact on the safety of products within the scope of this Regulation. In this respect, manufacturers should be required to adopt proportionate measures which are limited to the protection of the safety of the product within the scope of this Regulation. This does not preclude the application to products within the scope of this Regulation of other Union legal acts specifically addressing cybersecurity aspects. |\n|\n(26) |\nIn order to ensure that machinery or related products, when placed on the market or put into service, do not entail health and safety risks for persons or domestic animals and do not cause harm to property, and, where applicable, to the environment, essential health and safety requirements should be set out which have to be met in order for the machinery or related products to be allowed on the market. Machinery or related products should comply with the essential health and safety requirements when placed on the market or put into service. Where such products are subsequently modified, by physical or digital means, in a way that is not foreseen or planned by the manufacturer and which affects the safety of such products by creating a new hazard or increasing an existing risk, the modification should be considered as substantial when new significant protective measures are required. However, repair and maintenance operations which do not affect the machinery or related product\u2019s compliance with the relevant essential health and safety requirements should not be considered to be substantial modifications. In order to ensure the compliance of such a product with the relevant essential health and safety requirements, the person that carries out the substantial modification should be required to perform a new conformity assessment before placing the modified product on the market or putting it into service. In order to avoid an unnecessary and disproportionate burden, the person carrying out the substantial modification should not be required to repeat tests and produce new documentation in relation to machinery or related products that are part of an assembly of machinery, and that are not affected by the modification. |\n|\n(27) |\nIn the machinery sector, approximately 98 % of companies are small or medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In order to reduce the regulatory burden on SMEs, it is important that notified bodies consider adapting the fees for conformity assessment and reducing them proportionately to the specific interests and needs of SMEs. |\n|\n(28) |\nEconomic operators should be responsible for the compliance of products within the scope of this Regulation with the requirements of this Regulation in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain so as to ensure a high level of protection of public interests, such as the protection of the health and safety of persons, in particular consumers and professional users, and, where appropriate, domestic animals, property, and, where applicable, of the environment, as well as fair competition on the Union market. |\n|\n(29) |\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they make available on the market only products within the scope of this Regulation, which are in conformity with this Regulation. This Regulation should provide a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations, which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain. |\n|\n(30) |\nIn order to facilitate communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and users, manufacturers and importers should indicate a website, email address or other digital contact in addition to the postal address. |\n|\n(31) |\nThe manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer. |\n|\n(32) |\nThe manufacturer should also ensure that a risk assessment is carried out for the product within the scope of this Regulation, which the manufacturer wishes to place on the market or put into service. In this context, the manufacturer should determine which essential health and safety requirements are applicable to the product within the scope of this Regulation and which measures need to be taken to address the risks that the product might present. The risk assessment should also address future updates or developments of software installed in the machinery or related product, which are foreseen when the machinery or related product is placed on the market or put into service. The risks identified during the risk assessment should include those risks that might arise during the product\u2019s lifecycle due to an intended evolution of its behaviour to operate with varying levels of autonomy. |\n|\n(33) |\nThe safety of the entire machinery or related product relies on the dependencies and interactions between its components, including partly completed machinery, and, if relevant, with other machinery or related products that participate in a coordinated assembly of a machinery system, which can also result in an assembly of machinery. Therefore, manufacturers should be required to assess all those interactions in the risk assessment. |\n|\n(34) |\nIt is essential that, before drawing up the EU declaration of conformity or the EU declaration of incorporation, the manufacturer prepare technical documentation. The manufacturer should be required to make that technical documentation available to national authorities on request or to notified bodies in the context of the relevant conformity assessment procedure. Detailed plans of subassemblies used for the manufacture of the product within the scope of this Regulation should only be required as part of the technical documentation where knowledge of such plans is essential for assessing conformity with the essential health and safety requirements set out in this Regulation. |\n|\n(35) |\nA person who manufactures machinery or related products for his or her own use is considered as to be a manufacturer and should be required to fulfil all the related obligations. In that case, the machinery or related product is not placed on the market, since it is not made available by the manufacturer to another person but is used by the manufacturer itself. However, such machinery needs to comply with this Regulation before it is put into service. |\n|\n(36) |\nIt is necessary to ensure that products within the scope of this Regulation from third countries entering the Union market comply with the requirements of this Regulation and do not present a risk to the health and safety of persons, in particular consumers and professional users, and, where appropriate, to domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, to the environment, and in particular that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to such products. Provision should therefore be made for importers to ensure that products within the scope of this Regulation that they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Regulation and do not present a risk to the health and safety of persons, and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, to the environment. For the same reason, provision should also be made for importers to ensure that the conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that the CE marking, in the case of machinery and related products, is affixed and technical documentation drawn up by manufacturers is available for inspection by the competent national authorities. |\n|\n(37) |\nWhen placing products within the scope of this Regulation on the market, importers should indicate on those products their respective names, registered trade names or registered trade marks, postal addresses, websites, email addresses or other digital contacts at which they can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the size or nature of the product does not allow it. This includes cases where the importers would have to open the packaging to put their names and addresses on the product. |\n|\n(38) |\nAs the distributor makes products within the scope of this Regulation available on the market after they have been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer, the distributor should act with due care to ensure that its handling of the product within the scope of this Regulation does not adversely affect its compliance with the requirements set out in this Regulation. |\n|\n(39) |\nWith a view to ensuring the health and safety of the users of products within the scope of this Regulation, economic operators should ensure that all relevant documentation, such as the instructions for use, while containing precise and comprehensible information, is easily understandable and available in a language which can be easily understood by users, as determined by the Member State concerned, takes into account technological developments and changes to user behaviour, and is as up to date as possible. When products within the scope of this Regulation are made available on the market in packages containing multiple units, the instructions and information should accompany the smallest commercially available unit. |\n|\n(40) |\nInstructions and other relevant documentation may be provided in a digital printable format. However, the manufacturer should ensure that distributors can provide, at the request of the user at the time of the purchase, the instructions for use in a paper format free of charge. The manufacturer should also consider providing the contact details where the user can request the instructions to be dispatched by mail. |\n|\n(41) |\nDistributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the product within the scope of this Regulation concerned. |\n|\n(42) |\nAny economic operator who either places a product within the scope of this Regulation on the market under its own name or trademark or modifies a product within the scope of this Regulation in such a way that compliance with the requirements of this Regulation might be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer. |\n|\n(43) |\nEnsuring traceability of products within the scope of this Regulation throughout the whole supply chain enables a simpler and more efficient market surveillance. The economic operators should therefore be required to keep the information on their transactions of products within the scope of this Regulation for a certain period of time. However, that obligation should be proportionate to the role of each economic operator in the supply chain and the economic operators should not be required to update information that they have not produced. |\n|\n(44) |\nThis Regulation should be limited to setting out the essential health and safety requirements, supplemented by a number of more specific requirements for certain categories of products within the scope of this Regulation. In order to facilitate the assessment of conformity with those health and safety requirements, it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for products within the scope of this Regulation which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are developed and in respect of which the references are published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) for the purpose of expressing the detailed technical specifications of those requirements. |\n|\n(45) |\nThe current EU standardisation framework which is based on the New Approach principles set out in Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonization and standards (14) and on Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 represents the framework by default to elaborate standards that provide for a presumption of conformity with the relevant essential health and safety requirements of this Regulation. European standards should be market-driven, take into account the public interest, as well as the policy objectives clearly stated in the Commission\u2019s request to one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards, within a set deadline and be based on consensus. However, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission should be able to adopt implementing acts establishing common specifications for the essential health and safety requirements of this Regulation, provided that in doing so it duly respects the role and functions of standardisation organisations, as an exceptional fall back solution to facilitate the manufacturer\u2019s obligation to comply with those health and safety requirements, when the standardisation process is blocked or when there are delays in the establishment of appropriate harmonised standards. If such delay is due to the technical complexity of the standard in question, this should be considered by the Commission before contemplating the establishment of common specifications. |\n|\n(46) |\nWith a view to establishing, in the most efficient way, common specifications that cover the essential health and safety requirements of this Regulation, the Commission should involve relevant stakeholders in the process. |\n|\n(47) |\nReasonable period should mean, in relation to the publication of reference to harmonised standards in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, a period during which the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference to the standard, its corrigendum or its amendment is expected and which should not exceed one year after the deadline for drafting a European standard set in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. |\n|\n(48) |\nCompliance with harmonised standards and with common specifications established by the Commission should be voluntary. Alternative technical solutions should therefore be acceptable where compliance of the products within the scope of this Regulation with the relevant essential health and safety requirements is demonstrated in the technical file. |\n|\n(49) |\nThe essential health and safety requirements should be satisfied in order to ensure that the product within the scope of this Regulation is safe. Those requirements should be applied with discernment to take account of the state of the art at the time of construction and of technical and economic requirements. |\n|\n(50) |\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not satisfy or entirely satisfy the requirements of this Regulation. |\n|\n(51) |\nWith a view to addressing the risks stemming from malicious third party actions that have an impact on the safety of products within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should include essential health and safety requirements in respect of which conformity to the appropriate extent can be presumed as the result of a certificate or statement of conformity issued under a relevant cybersecurity certification scheme adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). |\n|\n(52) |\nManufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information on the conformity of machinery or related products with this Regulation. Manufacturers may also be required by other Union legal acts to draw up an EU declaration of conformity. To ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, a single EU declaration of conformity should be drawn up in respect of all Union legal acts. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, it should be possible for that single EU declaration of conformity to be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity. |\n|\n(53) |\nThe harmonised standards relevant to this Regulation should take into account the requirements of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (17). |\n|\n(54) |\nThe list of products in Annex IV of Directive 2006/42/EC has until now been based on the risk emanating from the intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse of those products or their critical protective function. Nevertheless, the machinery field embraces new ways of designing and constructing machinery or related products that might present higher risk factors, regardless of such intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse. For example, systems with self-evolving behaviour ensuring safety functions should be included in Annex I due to their characteristics such as data dependency, opacity, autonomy and connectivity, which might considerably increase the probability and severity of harm and seriously affect the safety of the machinery or related product. Therefore, the conformity assessment of a safety component or a system with self-evolving behaviour ensuring safety functions should be carried out by a third party, whether or not the safety component has been placed independently on the market or is part of a system embedded in machinery that is placed on the market. However, where machinery embeds a system of which the safety component has already been subject to third party conformity assessment when it was placed independently on the market, that machinery should not have to be re-certified by a third party solely on the basis of the embedding of that system. |\n|\n(55) |\nProvisions related to the third-party conformity assessment of software ensuring safety functions set out in this Regulation should only apply to systems with a fully or partially self-evolving behaviour using machine learning approaches ensuring safety functions. On the contrary, those provisions should not apply to software incapable of learning or evolving, and programmed only to execute certain automated functions of machinery or related products. |\n|\n(56) |\nThe CE marking, indicating the conformity of a product, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. The general principles governing the CE marking are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking on machinery or related products should be laid down in this Regulation. |\n|\n(57) |\nThe CE marking should be the only marking which guarantees that machinery or related products comply with the requirements of this Regulation. Member States should therefore take appropriate action as regards other markings which are likely to mislead third parties as to the meaning or the form of the CE marking. |\n|\n(58) |\nIn order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that machinery or related products made available on the market are in conformity with the essential health and safety requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, which include procedures from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. |\n|\n(59) |\nManufacturers should be responsible for ensuring that a conformity assessment is carried out in respect of their machinery or related products in accordance with this Regulation. Nevertheless, for certain categories of machinery or related products that have a higher risk factor, a stricter conformity assessment procedure requiring the participation of a notified body should be required. |\n|\n(60) |\nIt is essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services. |\n|\n(61) |\nIf a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards, it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Regulation. |\n|\n(62) |\nIn order to ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of machinery or related products, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies. |\n|\n(63) |\nThe system set out in this Regulation should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification. |\n|\n(64) |\nTransparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements. |\n|\n(65) |\nConformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the machinery or related products to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified, and the monitoring of bodies already notified, cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries. |\n|\n(66) |\nSince notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies. |\n|\n(67) |\nIn the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies. |\n|\n(68) |\nMarket surveillance is an essential instrument to ensure the proper and uniform application of Union law. It is therefore appropriate to put in place a legal framework within which market surveillance can be carried out in an appropriate manner with regard to products within the scope of this Regulation. |\n|\n(69) |\nMember States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that machinery and related products may be placed on the market or put into service only if, where properly installed and maintained and used for its intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health or safety of persons, in particular consumers and professional users, and, where appropriate, of domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, the environment. In particular, the proper installation of lifting machinery is essential to ensure the compliance with applicable essential health and safety requirements. Machinery and related products should be considered as non-compliant with the essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Regulation only under conditions of use, which could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour. |\n|\n(70) |\nIn the context of market surveillance, a clear distinction should be established between the disputing of a harmonised standard or of common specifications conferring a presumption of conformity on products within the scope of this Regulation and the safeguard clause relating to products within the scope of this Regulation. |\n|\n(71) |\nDirective 2006/42/EC already provides for a safeguard procedure, which is necessary to allow for the possibility of contesting the conformity of products within the scope of this Regulation. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with a view to making it more efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States. |\n|\n(72) |\nThe existing safeguard procedure should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to products within the scope of this Regulation presenting a risk to the health or safety of persons and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, to the environment. It should allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an earlier stage in respect of such products. |\n|\n(73) |\nWhere the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings in a harmonised standard or in common specifications. |\n|\n(74) |\nIn order to take into account technical progress and knowledge or new scientific evidence and to ensure a sufficient level of data availability, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the list of categories of machinery and related products in Annex I and the indicative list of safety components in Annex II, and if necessary of supplementing the obligations of Member States to provide data and information on the categories of machinery and related products which are subject to a specific conformity assessment procedure through the establishment of a common methodology. Where a new category of machinery or related products is added to the list in Annex I, the Commission should ensure that economic operators are provided with sufficient time to comply with their obligations under this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including with the stakeholders concerned and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (18). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. |\n|\n(75) |\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission for the establishment of a uniform template for the collection of data and information for the purpose of adding a category of machinery or related products to Annex I or withdrawing a category of machinery or related products from Annex I, for the establishment of common specifications for the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III, for requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of a notified body that does not meet the requirements for its notification, and for establishing whether a national measure in respect of compliant products within the scope of this Regulation which are found by a Member State to present a risk to the health and safety of persons, in particular consumers and professional users, or, where appropriate, to domestic animals or property, or, where applicable, to the environment, is justified. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19). |\n|\n(76) |\nIn order to facilitate the proper implementation of this Regulation, when adopting the implementing acts setting out and updating a template concerning the collection of the data and the information by the Member States on accidents or damage to health caused by machinery or related products, the Commission should issue guidance regarding the collection and transmission of comparable, high-quality data and information. |\n|\n(77) |\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts determining whether a national measure taken in respect of compliant products within the scope of this Regulation that present a risk is justified or not where, in duly justified cases relating to the protection of the health or safety of persons, imperative grounds of urgency so require. |\n|\n(78) |\nIn line with established practice, the committee set up by this Regulation can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Regulation raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure. |\n|\n(79) |\nWhen matters relating to this Regulation, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should, in line with existing practice, receive full information and documentation and, where appropriate, an invitation to attend such meetings. |\n|\n(80) |\nThe Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant products within the scope of this Regulation are justified or not. |\n|\n(81) |\nThe traceability of machinery data required for the technical file and for market surveillance purposes should comply with confidentiality rules to protect manufacturers. |\n|\n(82) |\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those rules are implemented. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. |\n|\n(83) |\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure that the products within the scope of this Regulation placed on the market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of the health and safety of persons, and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, of the environment, while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the need for harmonisation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. |\n|\n(84) |\nBy including machinery and lifting accessories and chains and ropes in its scope, Directive 2006/42/EC has completely superseded Council Directive 73/361/EEC (20). Directive 73/361/EEC should therefore be repealed. |\n|\n(85) |\nDirective 2006/42/EC has been amended several times. Since further substantial amendments are needed, and in order to ensure a uniform implementation of the rules on products within the scope of this Regulation throughout the Union, Directive 2006/42/EC should be repealed. |\n|\n(86) |\nIt is necessary to provide for sufficient time for economic operators to comply with their obligations under this Regulation, and for Member States to set up the administrative infrastructure necessary for its application. The application of this Regulation should therefore be deferred, |\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down health and safety requirements for the design and construction of machinery, related products and partly completed machinery to allow them to be made available on the market or put into service while ensuring a high level of protection of the health and safety of persons, in particular consumers and professional users, and, where appropriate, of domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, of the environment.

Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have sufficient reason to believe that a product within the scope of this Regulation presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, and, where appropriate, domestic animals or property, and, where applicable, to the environment, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the product concerned covering all relevant requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose.\nWhere, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the product within the scope of this Regulation does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take appropriate and proportionate corrective action, as provided for in Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, to bring the non-compliance to an end or to eliminate hazards or, if that is not possible, minimise the risk specified by the market surveillance authorities within a reasonable period which is commensurate with the nature of the risk referred to in the first subparagraph.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\n2. Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3. The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of the products within the scope of this Regulation concerned that the economic operator has made available on the market, throughout the Union.\n4. Where the relevant economic operator does not take the corrective action referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, within the specified period or where the non-compliance, referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, or the risk referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, persists, the market surveillance authorities shall ensure that the product concerned is withdrawn or recalled, or that making it available on the market is prohibited or restricted. In such cases, the market surveillance authorities shall ensure that the public, the Commission and the other Member States are informed accordingly, without delay.\n5. The information referred to in paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant product within the scope of this Regulation, the origin of that product, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator.

information provided in the instructions for use; |\n|\n(i) |\n\u2018reasonably foreseeable misuse\u2019 means the use of machinery or a related product in a way not intended in the instructions for use, but which may result from readily predictable human behaviour. |\nPART B\nGeneral principles\n|\n1. |\nThe manufacturer of machinery or a related product shall ensure that a risk assessment is carried out in order to determine the essential health and safety requirements which apply to the machinery or related product. The machinery or related product shall then be designed and constructed to eliminate hazards or, if that is not possible, to minimise all relevant risks, taking into account the results of the risk assessment.\nBy the iterative process of risk assessment and risk reduction referred to in the first subparagraph, the manufacturer shall:\nThe risk assessment and risk reduction shall include hazards that might arise during the lifecycle of the machinery or related product that are foreseeable at the time of placing the machinery or related product on the market as an intended evolution of its fully or partially self-evolving behaviour or logic as a result of the machinery or related product designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy. The risk assessment and risk reduction shall include risks resulting from interactions between machinery in order to achieve the same end that are arranged and controlled so that they function as an integral whole, thus forming machinery as defined in Article 3, point 1, point (d). |\n|\n2. |\nThe obligations laid down by the essential health and safety requirements only apply when the corresponding hazard exists for the machinery or related product in question when it is used under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer or in foreseeable abnormal situations. However, the principles of safety integration established in section 1.1.2 and the obligations concerning marking of machinery or related products referred to in section 1.7.3, and instructions for use referred to in section 1.7.4 apply in all cases. |\n|\n3. |\nThe essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Annex are mandatory; however, taking into account the state of the art, it may not be possible to meet the objectives set by them. In that event, the machinery or related product shall, as far as possible, be designed and constructed with the purpose of approaching those objectives. |\n|\n4. |\nThis Annex is organised into six chapters. The first chapter is of general scope and applicable to all machinery or related products. The other chapters refer to certain sorts of more specific hazards. Nevertheless, it is essential to examine the whole of this Annex in order to be sure of meeting all the relevant essential health and safety requirements. When machinery or a related product is being designed, the requirements of the first chapter and the requirements of one or more of the other chapters shall be taken into account, depending on the results of the risk assessment carried out in accordance with point 1 of these General Principles. Essential health and safety requirements for the protection of the environment are applicable only to the machinery or related products referred to in section 2.4. |\n|\n5. |\nThese general principles shall apply to the risk assessment carried out by the manufacturer of partly completed machinery. |\n1. ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS\n1.1. General remarks\n1.1.1. Applicability\nThe obligations laid down by the essential health and safety requirements are applicable to partly completed machinery insofar as those requirements are relevant.\nThe relevant requirements in relation to partly completed machinery do not cover the requirements that can only be fulfilled at the time of the incorporation of the partly completed machinery. However, the principles of safety integration established in section 1.1.2 are applicable in all cases.\n1.1.2. Principles of safety integration\n|\n(a) |\nMachinery or related products shall be designed and constructed so that they are fit for their function, and can be operated, adjusted and maintained without putting persons at risk when these operations are carried out under the conditions foreseen but also taking into account any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. The aim of protective measures shall be to eliminate any risk throughout the foreseeable lifetime of the machinery or related product including the phases of transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping. |\n|\n(b) |\nIn selecting the most appropriate methods, the manufacturer shall apply the following principles, in the order given:\n|\n|\n(c) |\nWhen designing and constructing machinery or a related product and when drafting the instructions for use, the manufacturer shall envisage not only the intended use of the machinery or related product but also any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. The machinery or related product shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent abnormal use if such use would engender a risk. Where appropriate, the instructions for use shall draw the user\u2019s attention to ways \u2013 which experience has shown might occur \u2013 in which the machinery or related product should not be used. |\n|\n(d) |\nMachinery or related products shall be designed and constructed to take account of the constraints to which the operator is subject as a result of the necessary or foreseeable use of personal protective equipment. |\n|\n(e) |\nMachinery or related products shall be designed and constructed in such a way that it is possible for the user, where applicable, to test the safety functions. The machinery or related product shall be supplied with all the special equipment and accessories, and where appropriate, with the description of specific functional test procedures, essential to enable it to be tested, adjusted, maintained and used safely. |\n1.1.3. Materials and products\nThe materials used to construct machinery or related products, or products used or created during its use, shall not endanger the health and safety of persons.

      "text": "Urgent action needed as China\u2019s export restrictions on rare earths disrupt European automotive supply chains\nThe European automotive supply industry is already experiencing significant disruption due to China\u2019s recent export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets. These restrictions have led to the shutdown of several production lines and plants across Europe, with further impacts expected in the coming weeks as inventories deplete. The current challenges underscore the importance of constructive China-EU cooperation to ensure stable and resilient supply chains for the global automotive sector.\nThe affected components are critical to both combustion engine and electric vehicles, highlighting the wide-reaching consequences of the measures. Since early April, hundreds of export license applications have been submitted to Chinese authorities, yet only approximately one-quarter appear to have been approved. Procedures are opaque and inconsistent across provinces, with some licenses denied on procedural grounds and others requiring disclosure of IP-sensitive information.\nWhile export controls on dual-use items are not unusual, such measures are typically based on transparent risk assessments and implemented with adequate lead time to allow for adjustment. The current approach not only risks trade disruption but also undermines trust in the global supply chain.\n\u201cWith a deeply intertwined global supply chain, China\u2019s export restrictions are already shutting down production in Europe\u2019s supplier sector,\u201d said Benjamin Krieger Secretary General of CLEPA. \u201cWe urgently call on both the EU and Chinese authorities to engage in a constructive dialogue to ensure the licensing process is transparent, proportionate, and aligned with international norms.\u201d\nChina and Europe share a common interest in safeguarding the integrity of global supply chains and trade. Chinese suppliers of permanent magnets rely on their European customers just as much as European manufacturers depend on Chinese materials. Sustained disruptions will reinforce ongoing efforts in Europe to diversify sourcing and invest in the development of rare earth-free electric motors. However, these measures offer no short-term solutions and cannot address the acute risks currently facing supply chains. They also threaten automotive production and thousands of jobs in the European Union.\nBy clicking the subscribe button you agree that CLEPA can process your personal data as detailed in our privacy policy"

  "argos_summary": "Elon Musk's Optimus demo at Tesla highlighted the U.S. dominance in humanoid robotics, while Europe quietly positions itself as a leader through disciplined regulation and collaboration. The EU's AI Act provides a clear regulatory framework for high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots, which fosters investor confidence and encourages safer design practices. Meanwhile, European startups like NEURA Robotics are gaining traction, emphasizing ethical tech design and integration into real-world workflows, contrasting with the rapid, less regulated advancements seen in the U.S. and China.",
