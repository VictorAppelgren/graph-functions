  "title": "George Washington University 'deliberately indifferent' to anti-Semitism, Trump's DOJ says",
  "description": "The Justice Department announced Tuesday that George Washington University was in violation of federal civil rights laws and \"indifferent\" to anti-Semitism.",
  "content": "Aug. 12 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Justice announced Tuesday that George Washington University was in violation of federal civil rights laws and described it as \"deliberately indifferent\" to anti-Semitism on campus.\n\nThe DOJ published a letter to GWU President Ellen M. Granberg saying that the department had finished its probe of the allegations against the university and found that GWU's response to incidents of anti-Semitic discrimination and harassment of Jewish and Israeli students that \"despite actual notice of the abuses occurring on its campus, GWU was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\"\n\nThe letter from Assistant Attorney General Civil Rights Division Harmeet K. Dhillon offered \"the opportunity to resolve this matter through a voluntary resolution agreement.\"\n\nThe allegations stem from campus protests in April and May 2024. The protests were about the Israeli attacks on Gaza, but some Jewish students experienced alleged anti-Semitism on several university campuses.\n\nThe letter alleged that students and faculty at GWU experienced a hostile educational environment \"that was objectively offensive, severe, and pervasive. The anti-Semitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking. The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and, most importantly, illegal.\"\n\nThe allegations stem from an encampment that students created in GWU's University Yard, in the middle of campus.\n\n\"The purpose of the agitators' efforts was to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli students free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment. This is the definition of hostility and a 'hostile environment.' [DOJ's] investigation found numerous incidents of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters. To be clear, Jewish students were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be 'caught' and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus.\"\n\nThe letter cites a few examples of students being harassed and having their movements restricted. It says the students were told by faculty and security personnel to leave for their own safety, and no other measures were taken.\n\n\"Jewish students, parents and alumni contacted GWU numerous times to express their alarm and concern about the actions of protesters and to express their legitimate and reasonable fears for their safety,\" the letter said.\n\nGWU is one of dozens of American universities that have been targeted by the Trump administration with civil rights and constitutional investigations in connection to protests over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has been cracking down on institutions of higher learning, especially elite schools, over a slew of allegations, from not protecting Jewish students to illegally enforcing diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\nOn Aug. 1, the University of California, Los Angeles, announced it had lost research funding from the federal government over the accusations of anti-Semitism on campus. UCLA paid $6.13 million to three Jewish students and one professor who said their civil rights were violated.\n\nOn July 30, Brown University agreed to pay $50 million over 10 years to workforce development organizations in Rhode Island, its home state. It also agreed to:\n\u2022 None Separate men's and women's sports facilities on the basis of sex.\n\u2022 None Stope the health system from prescribing puberty blockers or conducting gender reassignment surgeries on minors.\n\u2022 None Ban programs that contain \"unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes\" and instead utilizing \"merit-based\" admission policies.\n\u2022 None Provide data and information to the federal government showing compliance with the deal.",

It also said that during the short-lived encampment, at least 11 complaints were filed alleging demonstrators were discriminating against Jewish or Israeli students.\nComplaints included preventing the students from accessing parts of the campus. While stating that UCLA did not ignore the complaints, the federal prosecutors said that it \"took no meaningful action to eliminate the hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students caused by the encampment until it was disbanded.\"\nThe encampment was erected on April 25 and was disbanded on May 2.\nThe Justice Department said it is seeking to enter into a voluntary resolution agreement with the university to ensure that the \"hostile environment is eliminated.\"\n\"Our investigation into the University of California system has found concerning evidence of systemic anti-Semitism at UCLA that demands severe accountability from the institution,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\"This disgusting breach of civil rights against students will not stand: DOJ will force UCLA to pay a heavy price for putting Jewish Americans at risk and continue our ongoing investigations into other campuses in the UC system.\"\nThe announcement from the Justice Department came on the same day UCLA said it reached a multimillion-dollar settlement that includes paying $6.13 million to three Jewish students and a professor who accused the school of violating their civil rights by permitting the pro-Palestine protest.\n\"We are pleased with the terms of today's settlement,\" all parties in the lawsuit said in a statement provided by UCLA."

This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,\" UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk said in the Thursday letter addressed to the school's community.\nRelated\nFrenk said the funding affect is under the control of the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and other agencies, which will result in the suspension of certain research funding.\n\"This is not only a loss to the researchers who rely on critical grants.

Tuition is $71,000-plus each year with all students receiving a form of student aid.\nEducation Department Secretary Linda McMahon praised the deal.\n\"The Trump Administration is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions,\" she said in a statement. \"Because of the Trump Administration's resolution agreement with Brown University, aspiring students will be judged solely on their merits, not their race or sex. Brown has committed to proactive measures to protect Jewish students and combat Antisemitism on campus. Women's sports and intimate facilities will be protected for women and Title IX will be enforced as it was intended,\" McMahon said.\nShe added: \"Restoring our nation's higher education institutions to places dedicated to truth-seeking, academic merit, and civil debate - where all students can learn free from discrimination and harassment - will be a lasting legacy of the Trump administration, one that will benefit students and American society for generations to come.\"\nMcMahon made similar comments after the settlement with Columbia University, a private school in New York City.\nOn July 24, Columbia announced it will pay $221 million for the New York City private school to settle its dispute with the Trump administration and restore funding.\nIn March, the federal government revoked $400 million in federal funding over campus protests by pro-Palestinian activists. And the majority of the school's future $1.3 billion in funding had been put on hold, including science research.\nThis week, the Department of Education announced it launched a civil rights investigation into Duke University, a private school in North Carolina. The Trump administration paused $108 million in research funding.\nHarvard, also an Ivy League school, is being targeted by the Trump administration. In April, more than $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts was paused. Harvard has implemented some changes, but sued the federal government."
