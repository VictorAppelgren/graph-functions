  "content": "TV Legend Henry Winkler Feeling the Love For Deeply Personal New Project originally appeared on Parade.\n\nTV legend Henry Winkler shared his latest project on Instagram on Monday, August 11, and fans are absolutely loving it, with congratulations and appreciation pouring in, especially in light of the deeply personal touch that Winkler added.\n\nThe project is Winkler's very own Little Golden Book Biography, which is a picture book that tells the story of Winkler's life by author Betsy Groban, illustrated by Kayla Harren. Fans' favorite part is that it \"features a dyslexia-friendly font.\" \u2014 The Happy Days star has been open about struggling with dyslexia his whole life.\n\n\"L\ud83d\udc9cVE! Dyslexia-friendly font as well? Awesome! \ud83e\udd29,\" wrote one fan.\n\n\"Love the inclusivity of this book,\" wrote a third fan.\n\n\"Very cool \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb! I just pre-ordered a copy from Target,\" wrote another fan.\n\nAnother fan wrote, \"@hwinkler4real This is so cool and dyslexia friendly front is amazing! It was an honor to meet you in Tampa also!\"\n\nIn an interview with the Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity, Winkler revealed that he didn't get diagnosed with dyslexia until he was 31 years old, which obviously made school tough for him growing up.\n\n\"[My parents] thought I was lazy. I was called lazy. I was called stupid. I was told I was not living up to my potential. And all the time inside I\u2019m thinking, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stupid. I don\u2019t want to be stupid. I\u2019m trying as hard as I can. I really am. I was grounded for most of my high school career. They thought if I stayed at my desk for 6 weeks at a time, I was going to get it and they were just going to put an end to the silliness of my laziness. That was going to be that,\" recalled Winkler.\n\nHe told the YCDC that it wasn't until his stepson Jed was diagnosed with dyslexia, that a light bulb went off, especially after Winkler had been hard on Jed the way his parents had been hard on him.\n\nNowadays, Winkler actually co-authors a book series with writer Lin Oliver about a boy named Hank Zipzer who struggles with being dyslexic. And Winkler told the YCDC that he writes a letter back to every child who writes to him.\n\n\"Every child who writes me a letter about Hank Zipzer, I write back. In every letter I include, \u2018your learning challenge will not stop you from meeting your dream. Only you will stop yourself from meeting your dream,'\" said Winkler.\n\nHenry Winkler: A Little Golden Book Biography comes out September 2; preorder it here now.\n\n\ud83c\udfac SIGN UP for Parade\u2019s Daily newsletter to get the latest pop culture news & celebrity interviews delivered right to your inbox \ud83c\udfac\n\nTV Legend Henry Winkler Feeling the Love For Deeply Personal New Project first appeared on Parade on Aug 12, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 12, 2025, where it first appeared.",
