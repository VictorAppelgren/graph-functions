  "description": "NYSE:SWK 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Stanley Black & Decker's Fair Values from the Community and select...",
  "content": "Explore Stanley Black & Decker's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nThe market seemed underwhelmed by the solid earnings posted by Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) recently. Along with the solid headline numbers, we think that investors have some reasons for optimism.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\n\nFor anyone who wants to understand Stanley Black & Decker's profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by US$211m due to unusual items. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Stanley Black & Decker to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nHaving already discussed the impact of the unusual items, we should also note that Stanley Black & Decker received a tax benefit of US$109m. This is of course a bit out of the ordinary, given it is more common for companies to be paying tax than receiving tax benefits! We're sure the company was pleased with its tax benefit. And given that it lost money last year, it seems possible that the benefit is evidence that it now expects to find value in its past tax losses. However, our data indicates that tax benefits can temporarily boost statutory profit in the year it is booked, but subsequently profit may fall back. In the likely event the tax benefit is not repeated, we'd expect to see its statutory profit levels drop, at least in the absence of strong growth. So while we think it's great to receive a tax benefit, it does tend to imply an increased risk that the statutory profit overstates the sustainable earnings power of the business.\n\nOur Take On Stanley Black & Decker's Profit Performance\n\nIn the last year Stanley Black & Decker received a tax benefit, which boosted its profit in a way that might not be much more sustainable than turning prime farmland into gas fields. But on the other hand, it also saw an unusual item depress its profit. Based on these factors, it's hard to tell if Stanley Black & Decker's profits are a reasonable reflection of its underlying profitability. If you'd like to know more about Stanley Black & Decker as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Stanley Black & Decker (of which 2 are potentially serious!) you should know about.",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$313.3b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$152.78\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n7.3%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$72.0b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$58.64\n7D\n-1.0%\n1Y\n36.4%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$62.3b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.75\n7D\n-4.5%\n1Y\n28.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$53.1b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$235.91\n7D\n1.1%\n1Y\n32.8%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$51.4b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$162.44\n7D\n-4.9%\n1Y\n-4.1%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.7b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$75.23\n7D\n-8.5%\n1Y\n-9.4%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.5b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$104.33\n7D\n2.9%\n1Y\n44.7%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.9b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$18.68\n7D\n9.0%\n1Y\n35.3%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.8b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.79\n7D\n-2.1%\n1Y\n17.2%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.7b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$41.54\n7D\n-2.7%\n1Y\n3.2%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$22.73\n7D\n-7.7%\n1Y\n-37.6%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.6b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$27.09\n7D\n-15.3%\n1Y\n12.4%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.3b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$20.04\n7D\n-12.5%\n1Y\n-0.4%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$457.4m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.03\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n-16.1%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$405.7m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.36\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n-35.5%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$306.3m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$24.91\n7D\n-2.5%\n1Y\n-30.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$89.8m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.80\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n23.4%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$48.2m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.99\n7D\n-4.4%\n1Y\n-49.5%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$526.1k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0013\n7D\n18.2%\n1Y\n-81.9%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"

  "argos_summary": "Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. recently reported solid earnings, yet the market response was lukewarm, partly due to a significant one-off loss of $211 million impacting profits. The company also benefited from a tax advantage of $109 million, which may not be sustainable in the long term. Analysts express cautious optimism about future profitability, but the company's earnings have been declining at an average annual rate of -46.5%, contrasting sharply with the growth seen in the machinery industry.",
