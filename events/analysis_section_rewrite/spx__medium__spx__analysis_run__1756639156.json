      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first‑pass scenario, but it needs tightening to meet Argos’ standards. 1) **Citation density** – every numeric claim (CPI 2.7 %, core PCE 2.9 %, Fed’s September‑cut window, 5–10 % S&P move, 2–5 % upside) must be linked to the source ID (FAN5RYW6T) or a specific data point in the article; add inline citations. 2) **Quantitative ranges** – instead of “5–10 %” or “2–5 %”, give a tighter band (e.g., –6 % to –9 % for the base case, +1 % to +4 % for the upside) and explain the logic behind the bounds (e.g., tech earnings drag, Fed rate‑cut offset). 3) **Catalyst window** – explicitly state dates: September 5 payrolls, October 15 CPI, October 25 core PCE, Fed policy meeting on September 20. 4) **Transmission path** – show how a Fed cut (or pause) feeds through to tech earnings, equity valuation, and ultimately the S&P 500, and how sticky inflation keeps rates high, dampening discretionary spending. 5) **Alternative scenario** – flesh out the “tech earnings resilient” path: include a Fed delay to November, inflation easing to 2.0 %, and a 1–3 % S&P rise, citing the article’s mention of weak labor growth. 6) **Watch‑list signals** – list specific tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) and macro releases, and note that a surprise Fed hike or a CPI spike would invalidate the base case. 7) **Cross‑asset reach** – briefly note the expected impact on the DXY (strengthening if rates stay high) and on the 10‑yr UST (yield rise if Fed cuts are delayed). 8) **Confidence rating** – assign a numeric confidence (e.g., 60 %) and justify it with the structural concentration risk and the Fed policy uncertainty. 9) **Remove any drift** – ensure no mention of unrelated topics (e.g., Netflix, CrowdStrike) remains. 10) **Formatting** – keep the paragraph concise, but structure it into clear sections: Base case, Alternative, Risks, Watch‑list, Confidence. Implement these edits to elevate the analysis to world‑class, actionable intelligence.",
