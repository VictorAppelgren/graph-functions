  "description": "You probably won't be playing Cronos on Game Pass any time soon",
  "content": "Cronos The New Dawn isn't currently on Game Pass and given that it wasn't a day one drop, it's unlikely to be appearing in Xbox's free game library anytime soon. Bloober Team has released things on Game Pass before but not a huge number of their catalogue, which leaves a potential Cronos Game Pass release a very 'who knows' for the future.\n\nWill Cronos be on Game Pass in the future?\n\nSo while Cronos The New dawn isn't on Game Pass now, will it make an appearance anytime in the future? Well, for starters, not for a while - developer Bloober Team isn't going to give away any money while people are actively paying for it. It probably won't be making an appearance on any Game Pass tier any time soon, and you can definitely give up on an appearance this year. Christmas is closer than you think and a massive time for game sales, so there will almost certainly be no free Cronos before then.\n\nAs for later? Well, Bloober Team has released things on Game Pass before, namely Blair Witch in 2019 and The Medium in 2021. Blair Witch stayed on the service for a couple of years, leaving just before The Medium released, while the The Medium itself was on Game Pass for a year.\n\nSo, Bloober has done Game Pass before but in both those cases that was a day one release, which obviously hasn't happened with Cronos. It's also worth noting that it means Layers of Fear 1, 2, and the 2023 Remake, Observer and Silent Hill 2 haven't been on the service, making Bloober Team more of a 'not a Game Pass' studio, at least statistically.\n\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

While much has been said about the game's $50 price tag at a time when new releases are starting to push $80+, obviously it would be even better if you could play it for free as part of your subscription.\nMafia: The Old Country is the fourth instalment in the series, travelling back to Sicily in the 1900s to deliver an origin story, and this latest release is abandoning its open-world roots to deliver a more linear, narrative-driven experience. If you want to know more about how to access it, then here's the current situation regarding Mafia The Old Country on Game Pass.\nIs Mafia The Old Country included on PC or Xbox Game Pass?\nMafia The Old Country is not included on Game Pass for either Xbox or PC, so you can't pick it up through Microsoft's subscription service at launch. This isn't particularly surprising as it's not a first-party Xbox release, and being published by 2K Games means it already has plenty of support behind it. It is possible that it could be added to Game Pass at some point in the future, but if this does happen it will likely be years from now \u2013 so you shouldn't wait for this if you want to play the game in a timely fashion.\nThere is some history with Mafia and Game Pass to look at for comparison, as the Mafia: Definitive Edition was made available through Game Pass on both Xbox and PC in August 2024, which was around four years after its release. However, that game was withdrawn from the service in July 2025, presumably in anticipation for the release of Mafia The Old Country in August, which means there are currently no Mafia games available via Game Pass \u2013 a situation that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Where to get bolt cutters and open chained doors in Cronos\nYou can eventually open the chained doors all over The New Dawn, but it'll take a while\nYou'll find a lot of chained doors in Cronos before you know how to open them. That's because the bolt cutters you need are a big early objective in The New Dawn, and until you reach them you won't be able to open any of the chained doors. It won't take too long, although you should expect a few big fights along the way. So here is what's involved and when you'll eventually get the bolt cutters in Cronos.\nWhere to find the bolt cutters in Cronos\nWhile you pass several chained doors in Cronos, you won't be able to start your search for the bolt cutters until you find this chained elevator, around an hour or two into the game. At this point, with an objective to search the building and 'head to the dive point', getting the bolt cutters will now be your main goal - so that you can then get into the elevator and use it to reach the higher levels of the building.\nBy now, if you explored the area around the entrance to the building, you might have seen the bolt cutters through the window of this tool shop:\nHowever, to get them you'll need to stay on track with the current objective back in the building with the lift. There's a lot of fighting and some tougher enemies ahead, so check in on my Cronos tips for a guide on combat, dealing with the acid polyps you'll encounter, and more.\nThe progress at this point is basically linear: work your way up the building. You'll have to deal with a few enemies and various exploding acid things until, ultimately, you'll reach some biomass blocking your way. You'll be able to shoot some fuel visible through a nearby hole in the wall to burn it away.\nEventually you'll reach a room with a doorway blocked by a fallen cabinet, which you can move to get inside. The room is full of biomass and feels like a trap... and it is - you'll be attacked by acid creatures as soon as you enter, but they're slow and easy to deal with. Pick them off one by one, and save the fuel you can see in the middle of the room as you'll need it later.\nUse the balcony to get to an adjacent room, where you'll find the key for the Jedrus tool store:\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nPick the key up and you'll be attacked when you re-enter the previous room, and you'll probably be glad you saved the fuel... With those enemies defeated, head down and then out of the building but be ready - from this point it's just a constant, ongoing assault until you reach the bolt cutters.\nWhen you reach the little plaza area with the dead trees outside the building, you'll be attacked by an acid spitter on the steps. Take that out before you go any further, as when you enter the plaza you'll be attacked by several enemies of different levels. Just take it slow and try to stop them merging. Lead them around the various fuel cans and take your time until they're all gone - you'll have to come back this way, so you might as well deal with them now.\nOnce they're gone, you can finally use the key to get into the tool shop, via the locked door inside the building. Once you're in, you'll need to look through a window to shoot some fuel and burn away the biomass blocking the door to a small office. Doing that will, however, release a heavy enemy. Sigh. Kite him around the shelves in the middle of the room and take shots until he's done.\nWith the brute Orphan dead, you'll (finally) be able to grab the bolt cutters in Cronos.\nYou can now open all the chained doors you've been seeing. The game will lead you back though some previously explored areas as well, so you don't have to worry about going back out of your way to find them. The only downside is that the cutters take up one of your valuable inventory slots. It's worth keeping them to hand though, as the rooms they open are full of useful things and you'll only kick yourself if you can't access them.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

      "text": "The best upgrades to get in Cronos The New Dawn\nThere are some clear priorities to focus on in Cronos when upgrading your character and weapons\nThe best upgrades in Cronos focus on weapon charging and carrying stuff. While you might think damage and health are the only way forwards, with incredibly tough enemies and an inventory size even Ant-Man would struggle with, you'll want to speed up your charged shots and increase your carrying capacity as quickly as you can.\nThe best upgrades in Cronos The New Dawn ranked\n- Weapon Charge Speed\n- Inventory slots\n- Weapon Stability\n- Resources Limit\n- Shotgun clip size\nAbove are my top five upgrades for Cronos. Obviously you're free to choose whatever you want, but in my opinion improving these will make the game an immeasurably smoother experience and keep you alive for longer. Let's take a look in more detail.\nThe best Cronos upgrades explained\n1. Weapon Charge Speed\nAs I mention in my Cronos tips, there's basically no point shooting at an enemy with anything other than a charged shot. It bumps the damage up and can stagger them, giving you time to relocate or charge up another blast. Speeding up this charge time makes encounters a lot easier and should be a priority for all weapons, but especially your sword pistol.\n2. Inventory slots\nThe six slots you start with in Cronos are frankly insulting. Your pistol and shotgun with their respective ammo alone will take up four of those slots. Throw in a fuel canister for your flamethrower and a healing item and you're full. So put all your upgrade cores into inventory slots. I'm not joking. It might feel weird to ignore health but, without more space, inventory management is torturous and being able to carry extra stuff is more likely to keep you alive than being able to take a few extra hits.\n3. Weapon Stability\nThere is some fairly egregious aiming sway as a default when you first start playing Cronos, which can make aiming those charged shots tricker than it needs to be. Make sure you spend some cash on upgrading it for your pistol to give you more range and stability as you fight. It's less of an issue with the shotgun as that has quite a spread, and tends to be more of a close range last resort weapon.\n4. Resources Limit\nUpgrading your Resources Limit for crafting materials is less pressing at first because you can make things to clear some space. However, it's worth increasing it when you can as it simply lets you make more things. At its starting level you can generally make one thing, be it ammo or healing, before you're spent. Increase it and you can store more to make more.\n5. Shotgun clip size\nYour shotgun is a go to 'get out of trouble free' card in Cronos. Whether it's a boss or heavy enemy, or just too many foes getting too close, it clears the way and makes space in with its powerful blasts. It only holds two shots to start with and is slow to reload, so increasing the clip size will give you more immediate firepower in a pinch.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nHopefully my recommendations for the best upgrades in Cronos The New Dawn will help. It really is all about that charge speed though, as it's transformative to the tough and unforgiving gameplay. After that, getting more inventory slots will just cut down on difficult decisions on what to leave behind.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Silent Hill 2 remake developer Bloober casually confirms Cronos: The New Dawn release date is imminent during Nintendo Direct, with the new horror game set to release in September\nOh, OK!\nBloober Team snuck in big news during the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase today \u2013 its first original game since the Silent Hill 2 remake came out in 2024, Cronos: The New Dawn, is releasing on September 5, confirming a leak that trickled through a few hours before this morning's livestream.\nThat leak suggested Cronos would be out on September 5, with optional paid early access, and it's all true: Cronos will indeed offer 48-hour early access starting September 3 for those that preorder its $70 Deluxe Edition, which will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC through the Steam and Epic Games Store. You can only pre-order the survival horror game's $60 Standard Edition for Nintendo Switch 2.\nSeparate from its Switch 2 reveal, Cronos also received a release date trailer that provides a more close and haunted look at the time travel slimefest.\nIn the video, the Traveler protagonist \u2013 a woman sent on a mission to excavate the past for signs of an apocalyptic illness, the Change \u2013 encounters a man enjoying a relaxing moment by a creepy piano, in an old stone building populated with mannequins.\n\"I've listened to music once,\" he tells her solemnly. To this mysterious man, alone in a dusty room, things like stories and art make humans a \"perfect\" anomaly. \"This is how I do my own part in saving them,\" he says.\nThe release date trailer doesn't offer much more context, so the man leaves things on a cryptic note.

      "text": "9 Cronos the New Dawn tips to help you stay alive in this time travelling survival horror\nCronos is a tough horror game, so use my tips to avoid dying too much\nThese Cronos tips come from my own experience trying to get through this tough survival horror. It's one of those games that doesn't always clearly explain things, so it can sometimes feel harder because it hasn't emphatically outlined things you need to know. Enemies are tough and take a lot of damage, and you don't have a lot of ammo and resources to fight back with. I've spent hours working out the best survival techniques, so here's my tips and guide overall for doing better in Cronos The New Dawn.\nQuick tips for Cronos The New Dawn\n- Only use charged shots on enemies\n- Upgrade weapon charge times and inventory slots first\n- Fire fuel dispensers are infinite so always go back for more\n- Explore thoroughly to avoid missing ammo and resources\n- Craft items if you max out resources so you can pick more up\n- Always fight at a distance\n- Don't shoot acid polyps, get close, trigger them, and back off\n- Use stash boxes as much as possible to free up inventory space\n- Clear an area of enemies and resources before triggering objectives\n1. Only use charged shot on enemies to kill them in Cronos\nWhile Cronos casually mentions you can charge your shots, it doesn't really drive home the fact that it's the only way to actually damage enemies. If you fire normally you'll barely hurt them, chew through ammo and only have angrier, closer enemies to show for it. Save normal fire for blowing up gas cans and master aiming a charged shot at opponents heads for max damage and a chance to stagger them.\n2. Focus on upgrading weapon charge times and inventory first\nThere's a lot of upgrades to think about and while damage and health might seem useful, you really want to decrease weapon charge time in Cronos to maximise your damage output against enemies. Using cores to get more inventory slots is also vital, as you barely have enough for the weapons, ammo, and other essential items you need, let alone anything you might find while exploring.\n3. Fire canister dispensers never run out in Cronos, so keep going back to use them\nFire is an incredibly useful tool in Cronos, stunning enemies and burning up the biomass they use to get stronger. However, to start with you can only carry a single fuel canister, making it the sort of thing you end up saving and never using, in case you really need it later. There is no later. Use it now, knowing that the fire fuel dispensers never run out - if you have no fuel, they'll always give you some. So keep going back as long as you can, and use the fire to any clear bodies you find to make later fights easier. It might be a pain to backtrack, but as long as you can reach a dispenser you have infinite fire.\n4. Check every corner for valuable resources and ammo\nBecause Cronos is a survival horror game, ammo, health, crafting resources and all the other stuff you need is in scarce supply. It can also be well hidden in the environment - tucked behind corners and not always showing up unless you get up close. Because of that, get used to wall hugging rooms as you scour them thoroughly to make sure you don't miss anything. You'll nearly always find some extra bullets or a healing patch somewhere you nearly passed by.\n5. Use materials to craft things if you max them out so you don't lose anything\nMaterials occupy a separate part of your inventory, but still have a tight limit. If you find you can't pick up any more chemicals or parts, use them to make something you need. That way you'll get more ammo, health or fuel, and be able to replenish the resources. It's never clear when you'll pass a point of no return, so you don't want to leave anything behind.\n6. Fight at a distance wherever possible in Cronos as you're not built for close combat\nEven if it means awkwardly running away, try to keep a distance between you and any creature you're fighting. Because it takes time to charge your shots up to do any damage, you want a bit of room to get the time you need and line up your aim. You also have all the manoeuvrability of a lead barge, so if enemies get too close you just don't have the mobility to avoid damage easily.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n7. Don't worry about shooting the acid polyps, trigger them by getting close and backing away to save ammo\nIt might be tempting to shoot the acid polyps in Cronos from a distance to avoid the corrosive green goop they spray out everywhere, but you do not have the ammo to spare for that. It might take a few goes to get the timing, but you can totally set them off by getting close and backing away before they explode. Walk up slowly and wait for a change in the noise they make - you'll soon be able to tell when they've passed the point of no return, letting you get out of the way before you take any damage from the blast.\n8. Use stash boxes as much as possible to free up inventory space in Cronos\nBecause you start with barely enough inventory space to carry basic essentials, use the safe room stash boxes as much as possible in Cronos. It's even worth backtracking to dump off things like upgrade cores when you can, rather than lugging them to the next storage box (and also sell off any valuables you find). You can even think about leaving health and ammo behind unless you're desperate, as you'll usually find them, or the resources needed to make more, fairly quickly when you set off into a new area.\n9. If you're near an objective, clear the area of resources and enemies before you trigger anything.\nIf you reach the area of a specific objective, don't do whatever it is straight away - so hold off pressing any buttons, opening any doors or crossing any thresholds, until you've picked up all the resources and cleared any bodies lying around. It's all too easy to trigger an attack and if there's ammo left on the floor, or biomass monsters can use to make themselves more powerful, you're just making things harder for yourself. Check thoroughly for any resources and use fire wherever possible to clear corpses (if you can backtrack to a fire fuel dispenser it's well worth taking the time to do it).\nHopefully, my experience playing Cronos will help you get a little further in The New Dawn. It's the kind of game where it gets easier the more you know, but leaves you to work things out. So, hopefully, a little help from someone who's already worked things out will be useful to you.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

Interest in the game has been rising thanks to the involvement of director Leslie Benzies, who previously had high profile roles in producing the 3D Grand Theft Auto games before leaving Rockstar. To find out more, here's what you need to know about MindsEye and Game Pass.\nIs MindsEye coming to Game Pass on Xbox or PC?\nIf you were hoping to get the game for free as part of your gaming package, then I'm afraid I have some bad news \u2013 MindsEye is not on Game Pass, so will not be coming to Microsoft's subscription service on Xbox or PC. That means if you want to pick it up at launch on June 10, 2025 then you'll need to purchase it, with the price currently set at $59.99 / \u00a354.99. However, if you pre-order MindsEye then you do get the additional deluxe content at no further cost, which includes weapons and skins, a Horde Mode mission, plus access to extra missions and challenges in the future.\nThe offerings available through Microsoft's subscription service are being regularly reviewed and updated, so this isn't to say that MindsEye won't be coming to Game Pass at some point in the future as that may well be possible. However, unless we get a surprise announcement in the next few days, we can say for sure that MindsEye on Game Pass is definitely not happening at launch.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

  "argos_summary": "Cronos: The New Dawn is not currently available on Xbox Game Pass and is unlikely to be added in the near future, as the developer Bloober Team prefers to keep the title behind a paywall. While Bloober has previously released games on Game Pass\u2014such as Blair Witch and The Medium\u2014those were day\u2011one releases, not post\u2011launch additions. The article notes that the game will launch on September 5 with early access for pre\u2011orders, but no Game Pass tier is expected for this year.",
