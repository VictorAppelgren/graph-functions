  "content": "Ikea set to open first Sussex store in Brighton\n\nIkea is set to open the doors to its new store in Brighton in a move which is bringing more than 150 jobs to the city. The new branch - its first in Sussex - opens on Thursday, replacing a former Debenhams unit, with about 6,700 sq m of retail space across two floors. Churchill Square manager Mark Buchanan-Smith said he was \"super excited\" and it was \"brilliant\" to have Ikea as its \"main anchor\". However, one local shopkeeper has spoken of her trepidation at the arrival of the Swedish retail giant.\n\nMartha Tiffin, who co-owns and runs the nearby independent houseware shop, Utility, said: \"Obviously, we cannot compete on price [but] if we can survive this, we can survive anything.\"\n\nIkea's parent company, Ingka, bought Churchill Square shopping centre for an estimated \u00a3145m in November 2023. The new shop is smaller than many Ikea sites so certain furniture items will be delivered or available for click and collect. Previous plans for a full-size shop in Lancing were axed in 2021 with the company blaming changing customer habits. Mr Buchanan-Smith said those wishing to go to Ikea have previously had to travel to Southampton or East Croydon.\n\nMinutes away in the North Laines, George Diplocks, who runs the consignment shop Diplock's Yard, said the new Ikea \"won't make a difference\" to his business. \"Small businesses are going under anyway,\" he said, adding the proliferation of cafes and restaurants around his business meant people were not coming to the area to shop. Meanwhile, Ikea manager Karina Gilpin, said the new store would have \"everything you need for the home under one roof\" as well as food to eat in or take away. \"We're a Swedish company so to be able to share with Brightonians Swedish meatballs and the dime cake, it's very important for us,\" she added.",
