  "title": "\u2018Cheat sheets\u2019 in penalty shootouts: What\u2019s on them, how \u2019keepers make theirs and why they can be controversial",
  "description": "Henderson and Hampton both use different 'cheat sheets' in penalty shootouts. What are they? How do they work? Why are they a battleground?",
  "content": "As Alexis Mac Allister stepped up to take Liverpool\u2019s second penalty of the Community Shield shootout on Sunday, Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson lingered by the post, water bottle in hand. His eyes flicked between Mac Allister, the referee, and the list of shooters taped to the bottle he was holding.\n\nMoments earlier, Mohamed Salah had blazed his attempt over the crossbar and Jean-Philippe Mateta had scored to give Palace the advantage. A save now could be decisive. Henderson glanced once more at his cheat sheet.\n\nBeside Mac Allister\u2019s name, it read simply: \u201cL (left).\u201d\n\nMac Allister approached slowly, head down, avoiding the goalkeeper\u2019s gaze. Henderson waited, reading the rhythm of the run-up, holding his nerve until the last possible moment. Then, just as the Argentinian planted his non-kicking foot, he lunged left, diving low and strong to push the ball around the post.\n\nMac Allister froze in disbelief. Henderson sprang to his feet, ripped off the cap he was using to shield his eyes from the sun and gave a theatrical double tip toward the celebrating Palace fans at the other end of the stadium \u2014 the very picture of a \u2019keeper who had done his homework and was revelling in the rewards.\n\nHenderson also denied Harvey Elliott, helping Palace to a 3-2 shootout win for their second trophy in a matter of months. In May, they beat Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final, another day when Henderson proved decisive at a spot kick, diving low to his right to deny Omar Marmoush what would have been an equaliser shortly before half-time.\n\nTwo weeks before Sunday\u2019s drama at Wembley, another England goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, taped some notes inside her left sleeve; detailed references on Spain\u2019s likely penalty takers in the final of the Women\u2019s European Championship, built from scouting reports and statistical analysis. Yet, this time, it wasn\u2019t just her list that became the talking point, but also the notes from Spanish counterpart Cata Coll, who had details on England\u2019s potential takers plastered to her water bottle.\n\nHampton has claimed since the match that she threw her opponent\u2019s notes \u2014 and the bottle they were stuck to \u2014 into the crowd after spotting it sitting by the goal. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let them have that advantage,\u201d she said. Coll appeared to mock the claim on social media, posting: \u201cOK, OK, calm down, calm down. At least if it were true\u2026\u201d\n\nThe concept of the cheat sheet has been around long enough now to lose its novelty, but at the elite level of the game, it has never been more precise or more public.\n\nJordan Pickford was spotted during the England men\u2019s team\u2019s Euro 2024 quarter-final shootout win against Switzerland with a cheat sheet that contained the Swiss players\u2019 names, the direction he should dive, and sometimes a brief cue, \u201cstay\u201d or \u201cdelay\u201d. The idea behind \u201cdelay\u201d is simple: against takers who stutter or watch the \u2019keeper, holding your position forces them to commit without the early cue they are looking for. By staying balanced and still until the last moment, the goalkeeper still has both sides covered and can even sow doubt in the mind of the taker, increasing the chance of a poor strike.\n\nPickford saved a pivotal penalty from Manuel Akanji that day, after diving the way his research instructed him. It was enough for the win, and England\u2019s men ended up in a second straight Euros final.\n\nBy the time Everton faced Manchester City in the Premier League later that year, Pickford\u2019s notes had evolved into a far richer dataset (see main photo). Alongside each name sat percentages showing where that player had previously placed their penalties, with a simple colour code \u2014 green marking the most likely direction of their shot. Next to Erling Haaland\u2019s name was an illustration highlighting how he put his penalties to the right 55 per cent of the time.\n\nOnce again, Pickford\u2019s cheat sheet proved correct as he went right to keep out Haaland\u2019s penalty in the 53rd minute, saving a valuable point for Everton during their fight to avoid relegation.\n\nThough Pickford\u2019s two sets of notes were different in style, they did share one common theme: they were basic and clear, stripped down to the essentials. The value in that simplicity shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. In a shootout, where heart rate and adrenaline can spike and decision-making windows shrink to a second or less, the clearer the instruction, the easier it is to execute.\n\nPenalty preparation has been steadily building for nearly two decades.\n\nGermany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann\u2019s small slip of paper in his sock during the 2006 World Cup quarter-final shootout against Argentina is often cited as the origin point in the modern game. It contained hand-written notes about Argentina\u2019s likely takers and was theatrically consulted before each attempt. Again, the information was simple, but the act was deliberate \u2014 a blend of preparation and intimidation. Lehmann would go on to save two of the four Argentina penalties as the tournament\u2019s host nation advanced to the semis.\n\nFrom a coaching perspective, analysing the opponents\u2019 penalty history is largely done to provide a series of tactics for your goalkeepers to rely on in a crucial moment when thinking clearly can be one of the hardest things to do under pressure. At its core, a cheat sheet is less about telling you where to dive and more about reducing mental clutter.\n\nIn those moments before a penalty is taken, a \u2019keeper faces sensory overload: crowd noise, the opposing player\u2019s body language, the referee\u2019s whistle, the internal pressure to make a decisive intervention. A printed cue provides an anchor. Even if the taker changes their mind at the last second, the goalkeeper starts from a position of informed readiness rather than guesswork.\n\nThere is also an undeniable psychological layer at play. When a \u2019keeper pauses to study their bottle or wrist, it is as much theatre as it is preparation. The action broadcasts a message to the taker: \u201cI already know where you will shoot.\u201d That alone can be enough to trigger hesitation, a subtly altered run-up, or a mistimed strike.\n\nWhat a goalkeeper includes in these notes ultimately comes down to personal preference. Some want as much data as possible, others prefer a single cue. It\u2019s a personal preference how much information a goalkeeper takes with them on the field.\n\nMatt Freese, a goalkeeper for New York City in MLS who did a research project on penalties at Harvard University, told The Athletic that he begins preparing for opponents days in advance. He saved three FC Cincinnati spot kicks in a shootout in last year\u2019s MLS Cup play-offs to send his team through, \u201cI had no cheat sheet, nothing like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI had all 20 guys on their roster memorised.\u201d\n\nIn most conversations I\u2019ve had with fellow goalkeepers, simpler is better. You want enough to feel prepared, but not so much that you\u2019re overloaded when the whistle blows. And if, in the moment, your instincts tell you something different from the notes, go with your gut. In the game\u2019s most crucial moments, that feeling is often the correct one. Trust it.\n\nThe key is to read the taker\u2019s body cues \u2014 planted foot, hip alignment, shoulders, stride cadence \u2014 and then make a decisive, well-timed move. Combine that with the hours of video studied in preparation, and you have the subtle details that can tip the scales, the details most viewers never notice but goalkeepers live by.\n\nThis year, in my role as goalkeeping coach for Swedish club Malmo\u2019s under-19s side, I prepared a cheat sheet for the Ligacupen final in Sweden \u2014 insurance in case our game with Hammarby went to penalties.\n\nTo give our goalkeeper the best chance of feeling secure, we met on the morning of the match, watched every penalty our opponents had taken, and broke down each shooter\u2019s tendencies. Together, we decided exactly what he wanted printed on his bottle: name, number, dominant foot, and preferred side. Nothing more. It was designed to be read at a glance, because in a shootout, complexity isn\u2019t just unhelpful, it\u2019s the enemy of execution.\n\nIn the end, we didn\u2019t need the cheat sheet. We won 2-0 in normal time to secure our second consecutive cup title, but the exercise became an important reference point. It gave us clarity on how we wanted to scout opposition shooters and the tactics we could trust in the future.\n\nThe evolution of these sheets mirrors the broader data revolution in football. What started as instinct and memory has become a blend of video analysis, statistical profiling and behavioural study. Elite clubs and teams now track every competitive penalty an opposing player has taken, building a database that maps preferred sides, shot heights and strike patterns.\n\nFor the goalkeeper, the challenge is balancing that information with the reality of the moment. Some players will go against their pattern in a final, others will double down on their comfort zone under pressure. The goalkeeper\u2019s job is to read both the data and the person in front of them. That\u2019s why Henderson\u2019s and Hampton\u2019s shootouts were as much about presence as they were about prediction.\n\nAs teams search for even the smallest advantage, this trend shows no sign of slowing.\n\nHampton\u2019s tactics highlight that goalkeepers, coaches, and analysts are already exploring alternative ways to store and reference penalty information discreetly. It\u2019s not hard to imagine other innovations emerging \u2014 a laminated wristband hidden inside a glove or tucked in a sock, or a set of small, colour-coded symbols put on a glove to indicate preferred shooting sides. And while wearable technology, which could send subtle cues by sense of touch, remains off-limits under the Laws of the Game, rapid technological advances mean the possibility lingers in the background.\n\nBut as Hampton demonstrated, even the most creative storage method is only part of the battle. The other half is guarding that information and ensuring your opponent never gets the chance to use it against you.\n\nHenderson\u2019s and Hampton\u2019s moments this summer were, on the surface, just two shootouts. However, they were also snapshots of a broader truth: the penalty is no longer just a duel between taker and \u2019keeper. It\u2019s a contest between preparation models, information security, and psychological nerve.\n\nOne goalkeeper displayed his cues; the other ensured hers (and those of her opponent) remained hidden. They both ended up lifting the trophy. In the fine margins of modern football, that may be the ultimate reminder that in a shootout, it\u2019s the smallest scrap of information that can tip the balance between glory and defeat.",

  "summary": "The use of 'cheat sheets' in penalty shootouts is a key part of the game, particularly in the Community Shield shootout between Crystal Palace and Liverpool, as well as the referee and the potential penalty takers. The use of these notes can be controversial due to their precise knowledge of the player's position, which can influence the performance of the taker and potentially create doubt in their mind. In the past, England goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, was spotted with a cheat sheet that included details on Spain's likely penalty taker in the Women's European Championship final, and notes from Spanish counterpart Cata Coll. Despite these controversies, the importance of these 'cheat sheets should not be underestimated. The importance of this information should be noted, especially in the crucial moments of the shootout.",

      "text": "Whatever your view of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s contribution towards his nation\u2019s tactical cohesion, there is little doubt that his physical profile defies his age.\nPushing past the histrionics from the 39-year-old during the half-time break in extra time, Ronaldo showed a remarkable display of strength to recover from his penalty miss swiftly and step up to take the first spot kick in Portugal\u2019s shootout.\nEven among the most experienced players, you would be forgiven for expecting Ronaldo\u2019s heart to be thudding out of his chest before his shot at redemption. However, data revealed that the Portugal captain\u2019s heart rate was at its lowest as he stepped up to take the high-pressure penalty.\nGO DEEPER\nCristiano Ronaldo: A tale of two penalties at Euro 2024 - and why he changed technique\nThis information was logged using the fitness-tracking wearable device WHOOP, which uses physiological data to monitor an individual\u2019s overall health. The device is commonly worn on the wrist or upper arm and provides daily insight towards an individual\u2019s sleep, strain and recovery metrics.\nRonaldo became a global ambassador and investor in the company in May this year, joining other football ambassadors such as Virgil van Dijk, Katie McCabe and Beth Mead, as well as those in the wider sporting world including Rory McIlroy and Michael Phelps, who regularly wear the device as part of their health monitoring.\nGO DEEPER\nHow the growth of wearable technology is transforming football\nThe graphic below highlights how Ronaldo\u2019s heart rate was logged at more than 170 beats per minute (bpm) by the end of extra time, but Portugal\u2019s captain controlled his physiological state to bring that down to 100 bpm at the moment he took the spot kick. This jumped back to its highest at the crescendo of Portugal\u2019s shootout victory (~170 bpm) as Bernardo Silva\u2019s finish sent Portugal to the quarter-finals.\nFor context, an elite athlete\u2019s resting heart rate is significantly lower \u2014 often ranging closer to 40-60 bpm. It can be even lower: Spanish cyclist Miguel Indurain, who won five Tours de France in the 1990s, had a resting heart rate of 28 bpm during his professional career.\nRonaldo\u2019s data has garnered a lot of media attention in recent days and some might argue that the 39-year-old\u2019s heart rate simply lowered once his physical movement reduced at the end of extra time.\nHowever, the breathing techniques Ronaldo uses to control his autonomic nervous system are intentional. You will have seen it multiple times \u2014 the eyes closed, deep breath in through the nose, and controlled breath out through the mouth.\nWhy is this so effective?\n\u201cBecause it makes you calm,\u201d Ronaldo said in a promotional interview with WHOOP. \u201cWhen I do it, it controls my heart rate and makes my heart rate come down. It\u2019s something that I practise and build into my routine.\n\u201cIt is something that I always do in training, not just in games \u2014 because it is a habit. When you keep doing things the same, it becomes a habit, and that\u2019s why I look to control my breathing every time.\u201d\nAlongside other factors such as good hydration, a healthy diet, and regular sleep patterns, evidence shows that slow-paced breathing is a useful method of reducing heart rate during moments of stress or performance. The idea is that by taking fewer breaths per minute, ideally four to 10, a person\u2019s body moves towards a more relaxed state, which can include increased heart rate variability and lower blood pressure.\nAdvertisement\nThis week, England\u2019s squad have been engaging in a breathing session with expert Stuart Sandeman as a method of improving their physiological and psychological state.\nIt is the latest of multiple attempts to monitor and improve the players\u2019 well-being after Gareth Southgate and his 26-man England squad have each been given an Oura ring to wear during this summer, which provides an additional source of information to monitor health, recovery and sleep \u2014 much like the WHOOP device.\nRest and recovery \ud83d\udcaa pic.twitter.com/OXbU2Es8IE\n\u2014 England (@England) July 2, 2024\nIt is difficult to accurately determine whether Ronaldo was in a \u201cflow state\u201d during the moment of the spot kick as the WHOOP graphic suggests. Still, this term refers to a psychological state of focus on a task \u2014 something highly associated with elite performance. Being in the zone, if you will.\nFunctional MRI studies have found that individuals show less activation in the prefrontal cortex during flow, which is an area of the brain associated with thinking and planning. Instead, areas associated with attention and reward systems play a more prominent role in ensuring that an individual is maximising control and positive performance.\nVisualisation can play an important role in tapping into such a flow state and is a psychological exercise that has become increasingly prominent in recent years.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy Jude Bellingham walks alone on the pitch before matches\n\u201cSometimes I do it to visualise a few points that can happen in the game,\u201d Ronaldo said in an interview. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s my subconscious that does it by itself. It\u2019s nice, you visualise a few things, not even just the game \u2014 even when you\u2019re going to the stadium, warming up, before the game, as well as during the game. It\u2019s fun and I like to do it.\u201d\nAt the elite level, small details matter. The difference between victory and defeat can come down to centimetres, milliseconds, or an inhalation of breath. At first glance, Ronaldo\u2019s heart rate fluctuation during the crucial penalty shootout might have appeared innocuous, but there is scientific evidence to support the relationship between a player\u2019s physiological state and their playing performance.\nOf course, that won\u2019t stop our own heart skipping a beat when watching the drama unfold.\n(Top photo: Robbie Jay Barratt \u2013 AMA/Getty Images)"

      "text": "England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton says she threw penalty notes belonging to her Spanish counterpart, Cata Coll, into the crowd during the European Championship final-deciding shoot-out.\nThe 24-year-old claimed in an interview with TalkSport that she discarded the water bottle which belonged to Spain goalkeeper Coll, and contained notes detailing penalty statistics, into the contingent of English fans, while instead writing her own notes upon her arm to ensure Coll could not do similarly.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe Spanish keeper had it (penalty notes) on her bottle,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cSo I thought when she was going in goal I\u2019ll just pick it up and chuck it into the English fans so she can\u2019t have it.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI never put it on a bottle because anyone can do that, so I put it on my arm.\nHampton saved two spot-kicks while Salma Paralluelo fired her penalty wide as England defended their European title with a 3-1 victory over world champions Spain in the shoot-out. The game had finished 1-1 after goals from Alessia Russo and Spain\u2019s Mariona Caldentey.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard, when she\u2019s gone in the goal it\u2019s on its own isn\u2019t it? You just pick it up,\u201d the England international said. \u201cWhen she saw my bottle in there instead, mine\u2019s blank but it has the same sponsors and stuff so I just put mine in there, chucked hers in with the fans and she had an empty bottle.\n\u201cShe was walking back and I was walking the other way and she was so confused, I was trying so hard not to burst out laughing.\u201d\nThe Chelsea goalkeeper had played a pivotal role in keeping England in the tournament just ten days earlier, saving twice in the 3-2 penalty shoot-out quarter-final win over Sweden despite Sarina Wiegman\u2019s side missing four of their kicks.\nHampton described that shoot-out as \u201ctraumatic\u201d for the England squad, and explained how head coach Wiegman stepped up her team\u2019s penalty preparations for the final two rounds of the tournament in Switzerland.\n\u201cFrom then on Sarina was saying \u2018you\u2019re taking penalties every day whether you like it or not\u2019,\u201d Hampton said.\n\u201cWe were (doing so) before in the small-sided games, we\u2019d have a penalty for each at the start of the games but afterwards it was about taking two or three then after training, Anna (Moorhouse) and Khiara (Keating) faced about 100 penalties a day.\u201d\nHampton was one of five England players listed in the 30-player shortlist for the Women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or on Thursday, and emerged as Wiegman\u2019s No 1 following the international retirement of Mary Earps in May.\n(Photo: MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Crystal Palace won the 2025 Community Shield on Sunday, defeating Liverpool 3-2 on penalties after an enjoyable 2-2 draw at Wembley.\nAn entertaining first half saw goals from Liverpool debutants Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong, with a Jean-Philippe Mateta penalty equaliser sandwiched in between them after Ismaila Sarr had been fouled by Virgil van Dijk.\nAdvertisement\nEkitike continued to combine with the excellent Florian Wirtz after the break, but an improved attacking display from Palace saw Sarr equalise with 13 minutes of the game remaining, before Oliver Glasner\u2019s side had a strong shout for a second penalty \u2014 after the ball hit Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s arm \u2014 turned down.\nBoth sides had chances to win it in the closing stages, but instead the game went to penalties, where Dean Henderson showed his expertise once more, helped by some wayward efforts from Liverpool.\nGregg Evans, Matt Woosnam, Anantaajith Raghuraman, and Will Jeanes analyse the game.\nHow the penalty shootout played out\nMohamed Salah started things on an ominous note for Liverpool, blasting his penalty well over the crossbar even as Henderson dived the wrong way. Mateta, having scored a penalty in the game, then scored from the spot again, finding the bottom-right corner to give Palace the lead despite Alisson diving the right way.\nMac Allister, who replaced Curtis Jones in the second half, then saw his shot saved brilliantly by Henderson. The England goalkeeper celebrated the save by doffing his cap to the Palace supporters at the other end of the crowd. Eberechi Eze couldn\u2019t capitalise, however, jogging, stuttering and giving Alisson the eyes before seeing his shot saved by the Brazilian.\nCody Gakpo finally got Liverpool on the board, slotting into the bottom-right corner. Sarr, Palace\u2019s other goalscorer in regulation, delivered the calmest penalty of them all, taking two steps before stroking the ball just over a diving Alisson to put Palace back ahead.\nAnother Liverpool substitute, Harvey Elliott, in what might prove to be one of his final moments in a Liverpool shirt amid speculation over his future, then saw his penalty, a little too central, saved comfortably by Henderson, too. Borna Sosa, on his Palace debut after replacing Tyrick Mitchell in the second half, could not seal it for Palace, though, seeing his penalty cannon back off the crossbar.\nDominik Szoboszlai handed Liverpool a lifeline by blasting his shot into the top-left corner with a precise strike, leaving it up to 21-year-old Justin Devenny \u2014 who replaced Marc Guehi in second-half stoppage time \u2014 to seal it for Palace with an inch-perfect strike into the top-right corner.\nCRYSTAL PALACE WIN THE COMMUNITY SHIELD! \ud83c\udfc6\n\ud83d\udcfa @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/8j5e2mGSD7\n\u2014 Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) August 10, 2025\nAnantaajith Raghuraman\nFlorian Wirtz injects some fluidity into Liverpool\u2019s attack\n\u201cHe\u2019s really special in tight spaces,\u201d Milos Kerkez said about Wirtz before this match. That quality was on show in front of a packed Wembley Stadium on Sunday afternoon.\nIn the opening three minutes, Wirtz had moved across the width of the attacking third, trying to prise out a gap, but did not receive many passes due to the compactness of Palace\u2019s defence. In the fourth minute, he drifted over to the left to combine with Kerkez before playing a one-two with Ekitike, who received Wirtz\u2019s pass near the edge of the area, cut inside, and scored.\nAdvertisement\nThe Germany international\u2019s involvement steadily grew, as he constantly showed for the ball while combining well with Ekitike and Salah, with all three taking turns to try to feed the others\u2019 runs in behind. Wirtz was defensively switched on, too, at times pushing up with Salah and Ekitike and otherwise falling into the midfield line with Szoboszlai and Jones.\nHe created a fantastic chance for Ekitike in the 52nd minute with a cutback from the left after a neat passing move involving Gakpo, Szoboszlai and Kerkez, but the striker skied his shot. Wirtz also found a pocket in the box to receive a pass from Szoboszlai and shoot on the turn, but he could not direct his effort on target.\nWirtz\u2019s willingness to move across the pitch also fed into the overall fluidity in Liverpool\u2019s attack. Ekitike was willing to drop and receive with his back to goal, interchanging positions with both Wirtz and Gakpo, who assisted Kerkez in dealing with Daniel Munoz\u2019s runs from right wing-back. Frimpong staying high and wide on the right allowed Salah to play as an inside forward, too, with Wirtz operating as a No 10 behind him and Ekitike.\nFew stats will show it, but Wirtz is central to Liverpool\u2019s four-pronged frontline functioning at maximum capacity.\nAnantaajith Raghuraman\nHow impressive was Hugo Ekitike\u2019s start?\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Ekitike to announce himself.\nThe way he converted the opening goal of the game after just four minutes was sublime, linking up wonderfully with fellow new signing Wirtz to raise expectation levels ahead of the Premier League season.\nEkitike was signed as a striker ready to make an immediate impact, but also with one eye on the long-term future. Liverpool believe he has the potential to develop into a prolific, world-class striker and the early signs at his new club are good.\nIt\u2019s not just his sharp-shooting, either. The 23-year-old\u2019s fancy flicks and tricks are both eye-catching and entertaining, and crucially, they make a big difference. There was one moment in the first half where he split the defence with a flick on the turn. On other occasions, he dropped deep to collect and link up play with those around him.\nAdvertisement\nFor a tall, relatively imposing figure, there\u2019s a definite softness to his feet. Defenders Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Guehi didn\u2019t know which way to turn whenever Ekitike was running at them.\nOut of possession, he also roamed in and out of the back three with precision to free up space. He was a nightmare to contain and if this is the Frenchman early in his Liverpool career, still learning the patterns of play and the demands to play in a Slot side, then the future looks exciting.\nGregg Evans\nPalace show attacking promise once more at Wembley\nSarr took a while to come alive for Palace last season after joining from Marseille, but he was integral by the end of it, and he showed his worth again here. He won the penalty from which Mateta scored the equalising goal before finishing adeptly to score Palace\u2019s second equaliser.\nHe also linked well with Munoz in particular and his quick feet and sharp thinking were on show at times here.\nOliver Glasner will be pleased with how his side created ample openings, but there will surely be frustration at the inability to take those chances.\nMunoz was a thorn in Liverpool\u2019s side throughout the first half, given time and space down the right to put crosses in, as he did for Eze\u2019s FA Cup-winning goal. The problem was that either his crosses were too poor or his team-mates failed to predict what he would do sufficiently to make it to them in time.\nEze looked bright in spurts and Mateta, although quieter, made some excellent runs to create space for others to chase down through balls. But Sarr was the star of the show, capped off by the coolest of penalties.\nMatt Woosnam\nWhy was there no Palace tifo?\nThe tifos that covered the Palace end of Wembley for both the FA Cup semi-final and final, and were so striking and poignant, were absent today.\nThe Holmesdale Fanatics (HF), a Palace ultras group, who organised those displays and who raised almost \u00a314,000 for today, say they had \u201carbitrary restrictions\u201d placed on them by Wembley Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nThey were denied access to the stadium in the days preceding the match, there was a significant reduction in the permitted banner size, and only 10 members were allowed access on the morning of the game to set up.\nA statement on behalf of the FA and Wembley Stadium to The Athletic said: \u201cThe FA and Wembley Stadium have implemented additional measures for The FA Community Shield in relation to fan activations. These measures include an increased level of club involvement to ensure the safety of all spectators in attendance.\u201d\nThe restrictions relate to events in the lead-up to and during Palace\u2019s two previous visits to Wembley. For the Community Shield, both clubs were offered the same options for fans to be involved in displays, but some of those would have been required to be delivered by club staff.\nThey sang anti-UEFA songs and displayed banners reading \u201cUEFA Mafia\u201d and lit flares during the game, actions which are unlikely to endear them to the authorities, who may have been wary of what might be displayed, too.\nThe minute\u2019s silence for the late Diogo Jota was abandoned after noise from a mostly respectful and silent Palace end, although many complained of a late arrival into the stadium due to lengthy queues outside and were unaware of what was happening.\nMatt Woosnam\nWhat did Arne Slot learn about his team ahead of Bournemouth?\nLiverpool are in transition, no doubt about it, but Slot should be relatively pleased with the way his new players have settled in.\nThis was a team without five of the regular starters from last season, yet there was still a lot to like, albeit a few concerns defensively.\nChanging both full-backs will take time to get used to and may present initial teething problems. Liverpool also need Van Dijk to put this unusual performance behind him and produce the kind of display that helped carry the defence through last season.\nBringing in another centre-half as cover before the close of the transfer window is another essential. An injury to Van Dijk or Ibrahima Konate will leave the team light, no matter how much Slot talks up Wataru Endo as a backup defender.\nSlot will also feel more comfortable when Ryan Gravenberch \u2014 a star of last season \u2014 is back available, as he sat out of this one to be with his newborn child, and misses the opener against Bournemouth through suspension.\nAdvertisement\nOne positive was having Mac Allister back on the pitch for the final 20 minutes, and the prospect of the midfielder linking up with the new attacking players is exciting.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Liverpool going forward, but there\u2019s still work to be done at the back, especially as their title rivals have all strengthened this summer.\nGregg Evans\nHave Liverpool avoided the Community Shield jinx?\nLiverpool shouldn\u2019t be too disheartened after their loss at Wembley \u2014 victory in the Community Shield is far from a prerequisite for a successful league campaign.\nAs the table below shows, just one of the previous 14 winners of the season curtain-raiser has gone on to win the Premier League the following spring. That was Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City in the 2018-19 season.\n| Season | CS winner | PL winner |\n|---|---|---|\n2011-12 | Manchester United | Manchester City |\n2012-13 | Manchester City | Manchester United |\n2013-14 | Manchester United | Manchester City |\n2014-15 | Arsenal | Chelsea |\n2015-16 | Arsenal | Leicester |\n2016-17 | Manchester United | Chelsea |\n2017-18 | Arsenal | Manchester City |\n2018-19 | Manchester City | Manchester City |\n2019-20 | Manchester City | Liverpool |\n2020-21 | Arsenal | Manchester City |\n2021-22 | Leicester | Manchester City |\n2022-23\n| Liverpool | Manchester City |\n2023-24 | Arsenal | Manchester City |\n2024-25 | Manchester City | Liverpool |\nOverall in the Premier League era, just eight of the 33 winners of the Community (formerly Charity) Shield have gone on to win the title.\nThe last time Liverpool won both in the same season was in 1989-90, when they beat Arsenal 1-0 in the Charity Shield before finishing nine points clear of second-placed Aston Villa in the old First Division. However, they have won the league twice since then; in 2019-20 and 2024-25 \u2014 losing in the Community Shield on penalties to Manchester City at the start of the former campaign.\nWill Jeanes\nWhat did Oliver Glasner say?\nThe Palace boss was delighted his side were able to give their supporters another enjoyable afternoon at Wembley.\n\u201cI showed the players a video before we went to Wembley about the happiness of the fans after winning the (FA) cup, and this the emotional reward, standing here in front of the fans having these emotions. This feeling you can\u2019t buy with any money in the world so you have to deserve it, and the players deserved it today.\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk about other clubs, but what I definitely know is we have a great connection between the team, the club and our fans. I think every Crystal Palace fan is proud of being a Crystal Palace fan.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nGlasner also praised goalkeeper Dean Henderson and Justin Devenny, who took the winning kick. \u201cWe know Dean is a great goalkeeper, he has saved many chances for us and there\u2019s also a lot of work behind the scenes. With the analysts and with the goalkeeping coach he went through all of Liverpool\u2019s penalty takers so he was well-prepared, and confident.\n\u201cOn the other side I\u2019m delighted that Justin Devenny took the decisive penalty. When we were looking for a fifth taker he said he\u2019d do it and that takes a lot of confidence too. This is how we want people to be, to not be scared or worried about making a mistake.\u201d\nWhat did Arne Slot say?\nThe Liverpool manager acknowledged his side\u2019s defensive frailty during this summer\u2019s pre-season, something that was witnessed again against Palace.\n\u201cNow we are better at getting into promising situations than we were in the whole of last season. We are able to create more opportunities, chances and dominate more\u2026but it needs a little bit of an adjustment defensively.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t concede too many chances but we do concede goals at the moment.\u201d\n\u201cWhat made us really strong last year was that when we won by a margin of one goal it was mostly done by keeping a clean sheet,\u201d Slot added.\nWhat next for Crystal Palace?\nSunday, August 17: Chelsea (Away), Premier League, 2pm UK, 9am ET\nWhat next for Liverpool?\nFriday, August 15: Bournemouth (Home), Premier League, 8pm UK, 3pm ET\n(Top photo: Getty Images)"

      "text": "The semi-finals line-up for Euro 2024 is complete.\nWith France and Spain having assured themselves of places in the last four yesterday, England and the Netherlands followed them with victories today.\nBoth quarter-finals were tight and dramatic, in different ways. England once again looked laboured and devoid of imagination for much of their meeting with Switzerland, only to squeeze through thanks to Bukayo Saka\u2019s brilliant individual goal \u2014 which cancelled out Breel Embolo\u2019s opener \u2014 and then some heroics in the penalty shootout.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dutch, meanwhile, came from behind against Turkey to reach their first European Championship semi-final in 20 years, setting up a meeting with England in Dortmund on Wednesday.\nOur writers dissect the major talking points.\nEngland\u2019s penalty secret? It\u2019s all about the bottle\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be much in it at first.\nCole Palmer had just scored England\u2019s first penalty in their shootout with Switzerland and Manuel Akanji was sauntering forward to make his response. Jordan Pickford, the England goalkeeper, began to trot over too, before suddenly doubling back.\nPickford had forgotten something \u2014 his water bottle, which was rather oddly wrapped in a towel. Having picked it up, he moved back to his goal and placed the bottle, still wearing its towel, next to the side netting.\nHaving made Akanji wait a bit longer by moving forward to inspect the penalty spot, Pickford settled back on his goal line. Akanji had a short run-up and struck the ball with his right foot, but Pickford was one step ahead. He plunged to his left, parried the penalty away and England had an advantage they were never to relinquish.\nGood fortune? Not so much. This was actually a triumph of subterfuge for England and their team of analysts who had studied the penalties of all Switzerland\u2019s players, noted where they tended to place them and printed out their findings for Pickford to stick on his water bottle.\nThe analysis was captured by a photographer at the ground but Pickford was taking no chances in the moments before Akanji\u2019s penalty \u2014 hence his decision to wrap the bottle in that towel.\nAnd England\u2019s backroom staff had clearly done their homework well. They had deciphered that Akanji was likely to shoot to his right, so the best way for Pickford to play the percentages was to dive left \u2014 which he duly did.\nHaving got it right first time, it was surprising Pickford did not follow his bottle\u2019s advice on all the penalties.\nFabian Schar took their second one but rather than pretending to dive right before actually diving to his left \u2014 as his bottle instructed \u2014 Pickford did the reverse, faking left and jumping right. Schar\u2019s penalty unfolded as the bottle had predicted, to his right, where the net was vacant.\nAdvertisement\nPickford did follow his bottle for the final two Swiss penalties: Xherdan Shaqiri struck his to the right, but it was too well placed and his shot just evaded Pickford\u2019s fingertips.\nThe only penalty where the bottle was proved wrong was for Zeki Amdouni on the fourth kick. Pickford held his ground and dived low to his left, as he had been briefed, but Amdouni outwitted him by going to his right.\nThankfully for England, that one save was enough. And if their semi-final against the Netherlands on Wednesday also goes the distance, do not be surprised to see Pickford\u2019s bottle and towel make another appearance.\nAndrew Fifield\nSaka stars \u2014 but where is Kane?\nWhen Saka starts well, England start well. He was their best player in the first half against Serbia in their opening match of Euro 2024, when he repeatedly had the beating of marker Andrija Zivkovic, and today he was again.\nIt was no coincidence that the first half today was England\u2019s best since they started the tournament nearly three weeks ago. Pushed high and wide in possession, in a formation that almost looked like a 3-4-3, Saka was up against left wing-back Michel Aebischer. And he easily had the beating of him.\nSo many times in the first half, Saka took advantage of the fact that England were getting the ball to him far faster than they had been against Slovakia in the previous round. Saka got into good positions, put crosses in and forced corners. The only frustration was that England were never able to turn any of those crosses into serious shots on goal.\nStriker Harry Kane, who was prone to dropping deep throughout the match, ending up playing in defence at points in the second half, was unable to get on the end of any of Saka\u2019s deliveries. Kane was substituted in extra time after an accidental touchline collision with England\u2019s manager, Gareth Southgate.\nAdvertisement\nWithout the ball, Saka had to run back and cover Ruben Vargas, but he did that diligently. And when England needed him most, Saka delivered with the crucial equaliser, just when his team looked completely out of ideas.\nJack Pitt-Brooke\nCan the Netherlands go all the way?\nAn unconvincing run, a manager who not many are convinced by, a couple of come-from-behind wins and a feeling that being in the good half of the draw is the only reason they are in the semi-finals\u2026 for England, read the Netherlands.\nBut here they are, in the final four of the Euros for the first time since 2004. So, how good are their prospects of winning just a second major tournament in their history?\nWell, Turkey preyed on their weaknesses in today\u2019s quarter-final, especially via set pieces and crosses, while Austria also took advantage of a badly organised defence when consigning them to third in the group stage. But the Dutch have got plenty going for them too.\nAgain like England, when they\u2019re confident and in full flow, showing composure and intensity, they can be great to watch, as was the case when beating Romania 3-0 in the round of 16.\nTonight, they had to show resolve, spirit\u2026 and some tactical acumen from manager Ronald Koeman with his second-half changes.\nThree-goal Cody Gakpo is an obvious threat (who Turkey dealt with well until he crept in at the back post to take advantage of some dozy defending and help score the winner, via Mert Muldur\u2019s own goal), while if Jerdy Schouten, Tijjani Reijnders and Xavi Simons are given time and space in midfield they can play \u2014 and then some.\nDenzel Dumfries is always a pacy danger from full-back and then there\u2019s big Wout Weghorst to throw into the mix off the bench for some aerial carnage.\nEngland will have plenty to think about.\nOn current form, Wednesday\u2019s semi-final in Dortmund looks too close to call.\nTim Spiers\nGuler departs\u2026 as a star\nWhile a Barcelona teenager \u2014 Spain\u2019s Lamine Yamal \u2014 has rightly been garnering attention throughout the tournament for his sparkling performances, one from their arch-rivals Real Madrid has emerged as someone equally thrilling.\nArda Guler of Turkey may not have played too often for Madrid last season, mostly owing to injury, but he ended his debut year at the Bernabeu in fabulous form (five goals in five games) and brought that momentum to Euro 2024.\nHis second assist of the tournament against the Netherlands today was a beauty. Turkey and Guler, after a slow start, had come into the game via a series of threatening set pieces which the Dutch struggled to cope with, and the opening goal was an extension of that.\nPicking up a cleared corner on the right of the box, Guler was itching to try to work the ball onto his favoured left foot and whip it into the box.\nAdvertisement\nWith no angle to do that, the 19-year-old, who also hit the post with a free kick in the second half, reluctantly took a swish with his right\u2026 and delivered a picture-perfect outswinging cross that completely befuddled goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen, who resembled someone who had half-crossed a road only to recoil and hesitate when seeing a speeding motorbike careering their way.\nVerbruggen neither jumped to claim the ball nor reversed to his goal line. He was helpless. Step forward Samet Akaydin at the back post, only playing because of Merih Demiral\u2019s suspension, and he planted an easy header into the net.\nGuler\u2019s tournament may be over now, but you sense that this is just the start of a glittering career, for club and country.\nTim Spiers\nWhat\u2019s next?\n- Spain vs France (Tuesday, 8pm BST; 3pm ET)\n- Netherlands vs England (Wednesday. 8pm BST; 3pm ET)\n(Top photo: Carl Recine/Getty Images)"

      "text": "This article is part of our My Game In My Words 2025 series, an exclusive set of interviews with USMNT players where they talk us through how they do what they do on a soccer pitch.\nORANGEBURG, N.Y. \u2014 Matt Freese begins his meticulous pregame routine more than 48 hours before kickoff. He starts with meditation \u2014 lights off, stimuli banished, mind blank. Two days later, he ends with Steve Aoki\u2019s \u201cPursuit of Happiness\u201d remix pumping through headphones into his ears, again and again. In between, he does \u201ca lot of weird stuff,\u201d he admits.\nAdvertisement\nBut every quirk is calculated. \u201cEvery second of every day,\u201d Freese tells The Athletic, \u201cis committed to being ready for those few moments a game\u201d \u2014 the moments that have elevated him, in less than two years, from MLS backup to U.S. men\u2019s national team starter.\n\u201cGoalkeeping,\u201d Freese explains, \u201creally is four or five actions throughout a game, totaling 15 seconds.\u201d And several years ago, he dedicated his life to \u201cmaking sure I\u2019m ready for those four or five segments of two seconds [each].\u201d\nSo, he sleeps without his phone in his bedroom. (\u201cAnalog clocks all the way,\u201d he says with a chuckle.)\nWhen he awakes, he must see sunlight, and breathe fresh air, before he sees a screen.\nHe eats scrambled eggs every morning for breakfast. He brushes his teeth with his non-dominant left hand to improve coordination. The night before every game, he eats whole wheat spaghetti with red sauce and chicken, and drinks chamomile tea before bed. The following morning, in addition to the eggs with olive oil, salt, ketchup and sourdough toast, he wolfs down a bowl of Whole Foods granola with almond milk. As kickoff nears, \u201cI\u2019ll have the leftover spaghetti from the night before,\u201d he says, plus \u201cmore toast, and then a banana and peanut butter smoothie.\u201d\nAnd when he arrives at Yankee Stadium, or wherever New York City FC\u2019s grueling schedule takes him, he ties his shoes in a very specific way. When he steps onto the pitch, any pitch, \u201cI touch the grass, make sure it\u2019s wet, get one pair of gloves wet, put my other pair of gloves on,\u201d he says, before delving into his customary warmup.\nBut no, he insists, he is \u201cnot superstitious.\u201d More scientific.\nWith matchday music, for example, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of research about matching certain sounds with confidence,\u201d the Harvard-educated Freese, who graduated in 2022, explains. The \u201cPursuit of Happiness\u201d remix reminds him of Project X, and of when he was \u201can 18-year-old, thinking you\u2019re so cool. It kinda brings back that little bit of confidence that, maybe when you get older and mature, you lose.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAll of it, from the looping song to film study, from visualization to well-rehearsed workouts in the gym, has trained his body and mind to excel in the split seconds that separate international goalkeepers from average ones. It prepared him to seize his chance in New York. It propelled him all the way to the USMNT, to increasingly big moments. And \u201cbig moments,\u201d he says, \u201cis when I really come alive.\u201d\n\u201cBig moments\u201d and 1-v-1s are, to Freese, his two biggest strengths. When I asked him last week for his favorite example of the latter, he recalled the very save that I had queued up on my laptop, ready to project onto the TV mounted at the front of NYCFC\u2019s team meeting room.\nIt was also a big moment, Freese\u2019s first MLS season opener as a starter, 2024 against Charlotte. Four minutes after he\u2019d saved a penalty, Kerwin Vargas bore down on him again. Freese chopped his feet, then timed his charge toward the ball, spread himself, and kept the score at 1-0.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my best save, but it was probably the most momentous for my career,\u201d Freese says. It helped cement him as NYCFC\u2019s No. 1.\nIt was also evidence of what he calls \u201ca pretty unique ability to save 1-on-1s.\u201d\nThere\u2019s \u201ca lot of work and strategic reasoning behind what I do \u2014 in my strategy, technically, in the shapes I make and stuff \u2014 on the field,\u201d he explains.\nIt often starts with intense film sessions two nights before a game. Freese will study opposing forwards, and implant their tendencies in his mind. When they speed toward him on gameday \u2014 or when a cross fizzes into the box, or when a winger rips a shot from 20 yards out \u2014 \u201cyou don\u2019t think,\u201d he explains. \u201cNot only do you not have the time to think, but you shouldn\u2019t think. If you\u2019re thinking, you are going to either make a mistake or you\u2019re gonna be late to react. So all of it is, at that point, instinct.\u201d\nHe trains himself to \u201cwait, wait, until the moment you know you can make a 50-50 challenge\u201d on the forward. If he\u2019d rushed off his line earlier, Vargas could\u2019ve taken his shot a touch earlier, \u201cand then I\u2019m in no-man\u2019s land,\u201d Freese says.\nSo, he waited for that second-to-last touch, then darted to close down the angle. And that\u2019s when the scientist within him takes over.\n\u201cI\u2019m a nerd, so the way I think about it,\u201d Freese explains, \u201cis: I want to maximize my surface area relative to the goal. Whatever shape I need to make to do that is what I do.\u201d\nHow nerdy does he get? \u201cOh, very, very nerdy,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s six different ways I could\u2019ve approached this.\u201d He recalls another 1-v-1, against Cincinnati in last year\u2019s playoffs, where \u201cI [opened] up my body and spread the exact same way as the Charlotte one.\u201d\nOn that occasion, he made the save, but the ball trickled across the six-yard box, and Cincy converted the rebound into a game-winning goal. Freese didn\u2019t necessarily err, but \u201cvery minute details make a big difference,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had spread the other way\u201d \u2014 with his right leg outstretched and left leg trailing, rather than left outstretched and right trailing \u2014 his save could\u2019ve been firmer, and \u201cthe ball goes out for a throw-in.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe optimal body shape can vary from situation to situation, player to player. Freese believes his experience playing goalie in hockey as a kid, when his family moved to Minnesota, has helped him master multiple techniques. \u201cA lot of the internal rotation of the hips, and that type of movement \u2014 drop the knee, getting wide with your feet and stuff \u2014 I learned there,\u201d he says.\nHe even learned from track and field, where he was a hurdler. The 1-v-1 technique he used in Charlotte and Cincinnati (above), with one leg leading and the other trailing, is \u201cvery similar\u201d to that of a hurdler, he says. So it\u2019s \u201ckind of just natural to me athletically.\u201d\nFreese is not just a 1-v-1 specialist. His attention to detail and angles applies to all types of shots and sequences. He walked me through a save last summer against Atlanta, a Xande Silva curler that he tipped onto the post with a full-extension dive and reaching hand.\nSilva\u2019s sideways touch was his cue to anticipate a far-post curler, so he took a tiny hop back toward his goal line. With curling shots, Freese explains, \u201cyou gotta give yourself some more depth to be able to make the save. And if I hadn\u2019t done that, this ball goes in.\u201d\nHis other specialty, of course, is penalties. As U.S. fans and teammates learned this summer, and as Freese said after saving three in a Gold Cup quarterfinal shootout vs. Costa Rica, \u201cpenalties are my thing.\u201d\nPenalties have been Freese\u2019s \u201cthing\u201d for as long as he can remember. But when I began to probe for details of his approach, his openness subsided. In fact, his one pre-interview request was that I not ask about the \u201cvery long research project\u201d he\u2019d done on penalties while in school at Harvard.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to give anything away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done playing, I\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d\nHe said during the Gold Cup, though, that he still relies on the learnings. He knows how to read statistics and strikers\u2019 hips. And his results are irrefutable. Around 30 hours after we spoke, and after he kept his secrets guarded, Freese denied Colombian legend James Rodr\u00edguez in the Leagues Cup.\nMatt Freese denies James Rodriguez from the spot! \ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/3023k9BXNh\n\u2014 Major League Soccer (@MLS) August 1, 2025\nHe begins preparing for opponents multiple days in advance, \u201cbecause in the moment, I want to have rehearsed it so many times in my head that I\u2019m not even thinking,\u201d Freese says. In last year\u2019s playoffs against Cincinnati, when he saved three attempts in a shootout to send NYCFC through, \u201cI had no cheat sheet, nothing like that,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI had all 20 guys on their roster memorized.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSeven months later, he studied Costa Rican penalties on the USMNT\u2019s flight to Minneapolis. What, exactly, was he studying? Film? Statistics? \u201cI kinda look at everything,\u201d he says. In other words, he\u2019d rather not reveal anything.\nWhat he would like to point out is that, no matter how intensively a goalkeeper prepares, \u201cin the moment, you do have to read body language, read the moment, read the timing of everything.\u201d\nAnd he did walk me through the entire shootout.\nCosta Rica\u2019s first penalty, converted by his NYCFC teammate Alonso Martinez? \u201cThis one\u2019s annoying,\u201d he said with a hint of disgust as the footage rolled. \u201cHe did me. He did me dirty.\u201d\nThe second, his first save? \u201cHe was in his [own] head,\u201d Freese said of Costa Rica\u2019s Juan Pablo Vargas.\nAnd the third? \u201cI shoulda had this one,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought he was going higher.\u201d\nThe fourth, he said, spoke to how difficult the Gold Cup balls were to stop. They \u201cwere moving so fast,\u201d he remembered, and this one \u201cbeat me.\u201d\nThe fifth was his favorite save. Francisco Calvo had scored on him from the spot in the first half. Ahead of the shootout, \u201cthere was a whole discussion\u201d with USMNT goalkeeper coach Toni Jimenez about Freese\u2019s plan, he recalled. He chose to stay home, and batted Calvo\u2019s attempt away.\nSome research suggests that goalkeepers should hold their ground in the middle of the goal more often. I asked Freese why they don\u2019t. \u201cI think, from a risk aversion standpoint, it\u2019s difficult to just sit there in the middle for five shots. You look like an idiot,\u201d he said.\nFreese, on the other hand, looked clairvoyant. He guessed correctly on six of Costa Rica\u2019s seven penalties that day.\nHe also talked smack in Spanish, which might sound surprising. Off the field, he presents as a pleasant, polite person. But on it? \u201cOh, I\u2019m a big s***houser. Big time,\u201d he says.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m good at it, by the way. But I do it a lot,\u201d he continues. He takes after NBA and NFL players. And he knew that Costa Rica\u2019s final shooter of the day, 19-year-old Andy Rojas, was ripe for some s***housing.\n\u201cHe plays for the [New York] Red Bulls, so I knew he spoke English,\u201d Freese recalls. \u201cHe had only taken one penalty in his life before. So I really just wanted to get in his head as much as possible. And he\u2019s a young kid. \u2026 I feel bad for him, but that\u2019s my time to s***-talk. In the moment, there\u2019s no feeling bad.\u201d\nWhen he sprang to his right and parried Rojas\u2019 attempt, Freese clenched both fists, and stuck out his tongue, and nodded his head. Six days later, when asked whether the moment gave him confidence that he belongs at this level, he challenged the premise: \u201cThat would rely on me originally questioning my own ability, and my own position there, and the right to be there. That\u2019s never been a question. I know I\u2019ve put in work. I know I\u2019ve had the ability to do that.\u201d\nFrom afar, Freese\u2019s rise into USMNT lore has felt meteoric. A few months ago, he was uncapped. A few years ago, he was stuck behind Andre Blake in Philadelphia. He was riding the bench or playing for the Union reserves. When he did get first-team games, his performances were uneven or unremarkable.\nAll the while, though, \u201cI knew I had it,\u201d Freese says. In training, \u201cI was making the saves, I was making plays.\u201d In games, \u201cI would kind of get overstimulated \u2026 and overthink a dive, or not be present in the moment.\u201d That, he says, is \u201ca large part of the reason\u201d he began to invest in his mind.\nHis solution, his plan to conquer those half-dozen meaningful moments every week, was to \u201cteach myself how to be very present,\u201d he explains. To flourish in those moments, \u201cyou need to be so, so hyper-focused, and so hyper-present,\u201d he says. And to be hyper-focused, he had to get away from social media; \u201cI try to stay off my phone,\u201d Freese says. \u201cI think it is an example of something that takes you out of the present.\u201d\nHe meditates in the morning before checking his phone. He is constantly teaching himself to control his mind. His work, and his trusted routine, ground him in almost any circumstance. \u201cWhen you do the same thing every single time, and it\u2019s worked for you in the past,\u201d he explains, \u201cthen in those hard moments, or in those big games \u2014 when we\u2019re playing Red Bull in the playoffs, or playing in front of 75,000 people in Houston against Mexico \u2014 if I was able to rely on these [habits in the past], then there\u2019s no reason that the atmosphere and the number of people watching, and the importance of the game, [should change anything].\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat\u2019s what Freese comes back to when I ask about competition for the USMNT\u2019s starting role. Even with a World Cup on the horizon next summer, \u201cI don\u2019t think too much about it,\u201d Freese says. \u201cI want to be ready to play 10 games and then the World Cup. But I also need to be ready [for] the case that I\u2019m not even called up, and make sure I still have that fire, still have that hunger to continue earning it and deserving it.\u201d\nIn either scenario, he\u2019ll still have \u201cPursuit of Happiness\u201d on loop. He\u2019ll have the exact same pregame muscle-activation exercises, and yoga two days prior. He\u2019ll have his whole wheat spaghetti. \u201cI have my same stuff I\u2019m doing,\u201d Freese says, \u201cno matter what.\u201d\n(Top illustration: Eamonn Dalton/ The Athletic; John Dorton/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images; Aric Becker/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images)\nThe My Game in My Words series is sponsored by the Active Cash Visa\u00ae Credit Card from Wells Fargo.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence.
