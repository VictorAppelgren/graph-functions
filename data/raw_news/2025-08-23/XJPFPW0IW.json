If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\nAn experienced British skydiver \u2014 who died during a jump earlier this year \u2014 deliberately fell to her death just one day after she and her partner had ended their relationship.\nJade Damarell, 32, of Wales, fell into a field in County Durham, northern England, on April 27 and died of blunt trauma injuries, officials said, according to The Guardian. Coroner Leslie Hamilton ruled the death a suicide during an inquest held on Thursday, the outlet reported.\nDamarell \u2014 who logged more than 500 successful jumps in her career\u2014 intentionally failed to deploy her main parachute and disabled her automatic activation device, which would have released a backup chute at a certain altitude and speed if a skydiver was unable to do so, the Guardian reported. Her equipment was found to be functional after her fall, the outlet added.\nDamarell had been dating Ben Goodfellow, a 26-year-old fellow skydiver, for eight months before breaking up, according to the Daily Mail.\nWOMAN DIES AFTER FALLING AT LEAST 75 FEET WHILE HIKING IN NORTH CAROLINA\nDuring the inquest, Hamilton summarized a note from Goodfellow, which read that the couple had \"ended their relationship the night before\" Damarell took her life, the Guardian said.\n\"The night before Jade died, Ben called off the relationship,\" a friend told the Daily Mail.\nYOUNG CREWMEMBER MURDERED ABOARD LUXURY SUPERYACHT IN PARADISE DESTINATION\n\"He went to work the next day, and that\u2019s when Jade fell to her death,\" the friend added.\nDamarell \u2013 who had completed six skydiving jumps on the day before her death \u2013 typically wore a camera to capture her dives, but did not wear one during her last jump, according to the Daily Mail.\nFATAL SKYDIVING ACCIDENT IN ILLINOIS CLAIMS LIFE OF 40-YEAR-OLD AFTER DIVERS COLLIDE MIDAIR\nHer family accepted the coroner\u2019s ruling and expressed gratitude to the skydiving community for its support, saying they were \"incredibly comforted by how admired, respected and deeply loved she was,\" the Guardian said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThey remembered Damarell as \"brilliant, beautiful, brave and truly extraordinary,\" and added that they want to contribute to a \"culture where mental ill-health is met with kindness and support,\" the outlet added.\nLeslie Hamilton did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital."

The online movement is encouraging people to continue putting up England St. George's Cross and union jack flags.\nLGBTQ CELEBRITIES DIVIDED ON STARS AND STRIPES IN NEW DOCUMENTARY 'RECLAIM THE FLAG'\n\"Raise The Colours!,\" wrote MP for Newark, U.K. and Shadow Lord Chancellor Robert Jenrick on X. \"While Britain-hating councils take down our own flags, we raise them up. We must be one country, under the Union Flag.\"\nTower Hamlets and Birmingham City Council recently decided to tear down English flags that had been hung up in the streets by patriotic supporters of the movement.\nThe government has not taken an official stance on \"Operation Raise the Colours,\" but Downing Street has commented on putting up flags.\n\"Patriotism will always be an important thing to him,\" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said.\nAsked if Sir Keir is supportive of people who put up English flags, the spokesperson said: \"Absolutely, patriotism, putting up English flags. We put up English flags all around Downing Street every time the English football team \u2013 women\u2019s and men\u2019s \u2013 are out trying to win games for us.\"\nSome left-leaning outlets describe the campaign as zealousness, not patriotism. The Guardian cautioned the campaign \"may offer cover for far-right agendas.\"\nTHE LEFT IS CELEBRATING JULY 4 WITH PROTESTS WHILE THE RIGHT SEES A PATRIOTIC REVIVAL\nOne woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity in BBC's reporting described how the campaigners marked a crosswalk with red crosses to look like the St. George's flag as \"pointless\" and said it came across as \"very racist.\"\nA YouGov poll in June showed Reform UK party would be Britain\u2019s largest political party if a general election were held. Farage has always been a longstanding ally of the president and in February hailed Trump's victory as \"an inspiration\".\nHistorically overshadowed by the union jack until the 1990s, St. George's Cross flags now dominate at sports events.\nYouGov polling also shows a majority favorable toward flying the St. George\u2019s Cross, but a sizable minority view it negatively.\nA higher majority shows support for the Union Jack, Scotland's St. Andrew's Cross and Wales' The Red Dragon over the St. George's Cross.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe row over England\u2019s flag is set to intensify ahead of local and national elections, with councils deciding whether to allow the banners.\nFarage did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment."

      "text": "In a striking contrast to the sweltering heat gripping much of the East Coast, a 55-year-old hiker from Texas was rescued in frigid and treacherous conditions Friday evening from the high peaks of New Hampshire's White Mountains.\nCaroline Wilson, 55, of Austin, Texas, was found hypothermic and unresponsive on the Gulfside Trail, approximately one mile north of the Cog Railway tracks, while hiking Mount Washington, New England\u2019s highest peak, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said in a release.\nThe department said Wilson became incapacitated during the hike, prompting her husband to call 911 at 5 p.m. He told authorities that she could no longer move or communicate.\nHIKER DISAPPEARS FROM \u2018EDGE OF THE WORLD\u2019 CAMPGROUND ON TRIP WITH FATHER\nConservation Officer Rachael Stocker told Fox News Digital that she assisted in the rescue mission, and said Wilson was wearing cotton base layers during her trek. She said cotton is not the best to wear during hiking because the material is absorbant to sweat.\nShe noted that on Friday, it was raining intermittently, causing the 55-year-old to succumb to the elements and suffer from severe hypothermia.\n\"The White Mountains can be pretty unforgiving,\" she said. \"Weather changes here in a flash.\" Photos from the scene of the rescue captured the misty environment and steep rocky terrain.\nNew Hampshire Fish and Game Department conservation officers, along with volunteers from Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue, Pemigewassett Valley Search and Rescue, Mountain Rescue Service and personnel from the Mount Washington Cog Railway, mounted a complex response in severe alpine conditions to rescue Wilson.\nDespite a heat wave sweeping cities from Boston to Baltimore, conditions above 5,000 feet in the White Mountains were anything but warm. On the summit of Mount Washington on Friday, temperatures hovered around 20 degrees Fahrenheit, with wind speeds reaching 120 mph and dense cloud cover reducing visibility.\nHIKER FOUND DEAD IN MAINE, SEARCH CONTINUES FOR 28-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER\nSeveral hikers in the region were reported suffering from hypothermia throughout the day, the department noted.\nThe Cog Railway played a crucial role in the rescue operation, transporting rescue teams up the mountain and sparing them a grueling three-mile ascent via the Jewell Trail, the department said.\nThe first rescue team reached the ridgeline at 7 p.m., with a second team arriving an hour later. Rescuers battled high winds and cold as they built a temporary shelter to stabilize Wilson before carrying her back to the waiting train.\nUpon arrival at the base station, Wilson was handed over to a Twin Mountain ambulance crew and transported to Littleton Regional Healthcare for further treatment, the department said.\nOfficials credited the successful outcome to the tireless efforts of rescue volunteers and the Cog Railway\u2019s continued support in emergency efforts.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The weather was not great and the conditions were potentially life-threatening,\" a department said, \"but each group responded to the call for assistance and endured less-than-hospitable weather conditions to save the life of this hiker.\""

      "text": "Rescuers involved in trying to save a woman stuck 22,000ft up a mountain with a broken leg now fear she may have died, after the latest search mission was called off after ten days due to bad weather.\nRussian mountaineer Natalia, also known as Natasha, Nagovitsina, 47, has been trapped at 22,965ft on Victory Peak in Kyrgyzstan, with a summit height of 24,406ft.\nNagovitsina, who is a well-known mountaineer, was reportedly seen moving on drone footage as recently as three days ago.\nShe was injured on August 12, when her climbing partner helped her as best they could before returning further down the mountain to get help.\nBut since then temperatures have sunk to minus 23C and multiple rescue attempts have ended in the tragic death of one rescuer.\nItalian climber Luca Sinigaglia, 49, was one of those who attempted to rescue her and managed to deliver a sleeping bag, tent, food, water and a gas cooker to Nagovitsina.\nBut repeated efforts to bring her down failed, both by climbing and using a helicopter.\nMatters escalated after Sinigaglia himself then died on the mountain from prolonged exposure to low oxygen and hypothermia.\nRussian mountaineer Natalia, also known as Natasha, Nagovitsina, 47, has been trapped at 22,965ft on Victory Peak in Kyrgyzstan, with a summit height of 24,406ft\nDrone footage filmed four days ago showed clear movement from the sleeping bag she has been sheltering in\nNagovitsina went viral in 2021 after she refused to leave her husband Sergei (right), after he suffered a stroke at 22,000ft\nNow Eduard Kubatov, head of the Kyrgyz Mountaineering Federation, has said that it is 'highly likely' that Nagovitsina is no longer alive.\n'Due to severe weather conditions, climbers cannot get to Nagovitsyna,' he told the BBC.\n'She has been at an altitude of seven thousand meters for more than nine days. This is practically incompatible with normal life, because at this altitude the body begins to die by 10% daily due to exhaustion and loss of strength.'\nOn Saturday, a final effort to climb to Nagovitsina was abandoned just 3,600ft below where she is stuck, with the weather set to worsen, as the team were ordered to return to base camp.\nPrevious attempts involved two separate helicopters, including a defence ministry Mi-8 helicopter which crashed as it sought to rescue her.\nAnother helicopter, a Mi-17VM, was sent, but zero visibility again forced rescuers to abandon the attempt.\nDmitry Grekov, rescue leader and head of base camp at Victory Peak, said that experienced mountaineer Vitaly Akimov had led a team seeking to climb to Nagovitsina.\nBut the crew was forced to turn around when started suffering back pain from the helicopter crash and the mission was abandoned.\nSinigagli, who had also been on the helicopter, was hailed a hero on social media after news of his death reached base camp.\n'I turned the whole group around, there were four of them,' said Grekov.\nAsked if Nagovitsina was still alive, he admitted he did not know but said: 'I think not, because she has been there since 12 August - count how much time has passed.\nToday a final effort to climb to Nagovitsina was abandoned just 3,600ft below where Nagovitsina is stuck, with the weather set to worsen, as the team were ordered to return to base\nThe Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed the rescue mission has been called off\n'It is unrealistic. It is unrealistic to survive at such an altitude.'\nThe Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed the rescue mission had been called off.\nNagovitsina shot to fame four years ago when she refused orders to leave her husband alone on another mountain after he suffered a stroke at 22,638ft.\nHe died on the mountain, but she somehow managed to survive the incident in 2021.\nHer radio conversion with base camp went viral as she refused to leave husband Sergei Nagovitsin on the mountain, close to the borders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and China.\n'He can't sit up, falls on his side, his speech is confused,' she told rescuers.\n'Natasha, you need to go down yourself. You won't be able to help him in any way. Do you understand me? Over.'\nShe replied: 'I understand everything, but I will not leave him alone.'\nPrevious rescue efforts for the climber failed due to bad weather\nThe team later told her: 'You need to go down, Natasha, the weather is getting worse, it's almost night.'\n'I won't leave my husband, he's completely helpless, I'm giving him something to drink.'\n'So, your decision is to spend the night next to him?'\n'Yes.'\nRescuers eventually reached the pair and two men tried to move Sergey while she went down.\nBut they could not go far, and secured him with ropes, and left all their warm clothing and food, before cutting a route further down the mountain, to get more help.\nWhen they were able to return, he was nowhere to be found.\nA report on the incident ruled: 'Most likely in delirium he broke out of ropes and crashed to his death. His body has never been found.\n'A year later Natalia once again went to Khan Tengri to install a plaque in memory of her husband.\n'But no one in the new group had any idea what this courageous woman had lived through on that summit a year earlier \u2013 a woman who showed the whole world what love and self-sacrifice mean.'\nHis body was never found."

  "argos_summary": "A rescue mission for Russian climber Natasha Nagovitsina, who broke her leg on Victory Peak in Kyrgyzstan and has been stranded at 22,965 feet since August 12, has been called off after repeated attempts failed and the weather worsened. Italian climber Luca Sinigaglia died of hypothermia while trying to help her, and a defense ministry helicopter crash left four injured. Drone footage last confirmed her presence, but subsequent flights found no signs of life as temperatures dropped to minus 9\u00b0F. Rescue leader Dmitry Grekov stated that survival at that altitude for so long is unrealistic, and the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed the mission was abandoned. The story also notes Nagovitsina\u2019s earlier fame for refusing to leave her husband during a 2021 mountain incident, and mentions related events such as a mammoth discovery and flag controversy, though these are peripheral to the main rescue narrative.",
