  "description": "Focusing on outcomes over hours helps leaders build smarter teams, support Gen Z\u2019s need for flexibility, and eliminate performative busyness.",
  "content": "When I entered the workforce, I remember trying to appear constantly available to my bosses. It was the height of hustle culture, back when phrases like \u201cI\u2019ll sleep when I\u2019m dead\u201d actually sounded cool. Prioritizing work above all else felt like a prerequisite for climbing the corporate ladder. It was also a fast-track to burnout.\n\nNow, as the CEO of my own company, I appreciate when employees and candidates are honest about their boundaries. To me, it signals a well-rounded person who is more likely to thrive and stick around. I\u2019m more interested in how they think, whether they\u2019re solution-oriented, and what kind of energy they bring to the team. For a long time, putting in more hours was the unspoken rule for proving your commitment to your job. But that\u2019s changing. Today\u2019s workplace increasingly values outcomes over hours. The \u201calways-on\u201d era is giving way to something very different. Employees are prioritizing a holistic sense of well-being, and I think that\u2019s a positive shift for individuals and organizations alike. Here\u2019s why. The \u201crocks, pebbles, and sand\u201d metaphor is a useful way to rethink how we measure productivity, for ourselves and for our teams. The rocks are the priorities: the high-impact tasks that inspire employees and energize them. For me, the rocks are writing and strategizing how to simplify our users\u2019 lives through automation. The sand, on the other hand, is the low-value busywork\u2014those draining tasks that clutter the day without moving the needle. Think: expense reports, invoicing, unnecessary meetings, or chasing status updates.\n\nIt\u2019s easier than ever to fill our calendars with sand and convince ourselves we\u2019re being productive. But when our teams are overloaded with the trivial\u2014the sand\u2014there\u2019s no room left for meaningful work. Leaders are tasked with protecting time for the rocks, in our own schedules and across organizations. That means setting an example about clearly and regularly outlining priorities, encouraging employees to streamline or eliminate busywork, and valuing outcomes over hours. Just because someone is still online at 6:30 p.m. doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re being effective. And just because someone has to cut out early doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t had a productive day. Create a culture that values deep and smart work, and you\u2019ll see not only better results but also more energized employees.\n\nConstraints often spark creativity. Deadlines, for example, force us to figure out the most efficient way to get something done. If you\u2019ve ever pulled off a last-minute project under the gun and surprised yourself with how quickly you accomplished it, you know the power of time pressure. You might have even thought afterward: If only I could always work with that kind of momentum. By contrast, when organizations focus on hours worked, with face-time requirements and mandating that employees be \u201con\u201d for a certain number of hours each day, tasks tend to expand to fill the time available. That\u2019s the antithesis of true productivity. Consider law firms, where clients are billed by the hour. Lawyers must track every minute of their day. Those who work quickly and efficiently are often penalized, with fewer hours to bill. It\u2019s a system that rewards time spent over value delivered.\n\nWhen leaders shift the focus to outcomes, employees are naturally motivated to work smarter, not longer. This requires setting clear expectations for what success looks like on a project or task, beyond just the time spent. As Georgia Dawson, senior partner at global law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, puts it: \u201cIt would be ideal for the industry if we can start to move toward more of a focus on outputs and the value that is being delivered by lawyers. That supports a drive toward efficiency, a drive toward the use of technology, and it can help to support a better focus on mental health, well-being, and diversity in the profession as well.\u201d The same logic applies beyond law. Outcome-oriented environments lead to smarter work, better tools, and healthier teams.\n\nRecent research from Deloitte shows that younger generations, especially Gen Z, highly value flexibility in when, where, and how they work. But many aren\u2019t experiencing that flexibility in practice. Instead, they report high levels of anxiety about work-life balance, with long hours being a significant contributor to that stress. Adopting a more outcome-focused approach helps bridge that gap. When employees are trusted to deliver results rather than log hours, they gain the autonomy to structure their schedules around their lives. That flexibility supports higher levels of well-being, stronger performance, and boosted engagement. It creates the kind of work atmosphere that younger employees gravitate toward. I\u2019ve seen firsthand how Gen Z thrives with more flexibility, and it benefits our company too. They\u2019re tech-savvy and automation-minded. Give them a goal, and they\u2019ll often find faster, smarter ways to achieve it. When leaders focus on outcomes instead of hours, they unlock that productivity potential.",

      "text": "New York, NY, USA 15 May 2024\u2014Now in its 13th year, Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Gen Z and Millennial Survey connected with nearly 23,000 respondents across 44 countries, examining the evolving circumstances shaping the workplace and the societal experiences of these generations globally.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s survey spotlights two generations who are grappling with financial insecurity, high stress levels, and mounting climate anxiety. They are also considering how rapidly evolving technology, like GenAI, will impact their jobs and their longer-term career decisions,\u201d says Elizabeth Faber, Deloitte Global Chief People & Purpose Officer. \u201cBut they see reasons for optimism in the year ahead and they continue to push for the changes they want to see, in the workplace and society more broadly.\u201d\nEconomic optimism on the rise despite continued financial concerns\nFor the third year in a row, the cost of living is Gen Zs\u2019 and millennials\u2019 top concern. Roughly six in 10 Gen Zs (56%) and millennials (55%) live paycheck-to-paycheck\u2014up five points for Gen Zs and three points for millennials since last year. And around three in 10 say they do not feel financially secure.\nYet, there is cautious optimism that circumstances may improve. Just under a third of Gen Zs and millennials believe the economic situation in their countries will improve over the next year\u2014the highest percentage since the 2020 Millennial Survey, fielded just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And, nearly half of Gen Zs (48%) and four in 10 millennials (40%) expect their personal financial situations to improve over the next year.\nPurpose is key to job satisfaction\nPurpose is key to workplace satisfaction and well-being, according to nearly nine in 10 Gen Zs (86%) and millennials (89%). And increasingly, these generations are willing to turn down assignments and employers based on their personal ethics or beliefs\u2014half of Gen Zs (50%) and just over four in 10 millennials (43%) have rejected assignments. Nearly as many (44% of Gen Zs and 40% of millennials) said they have rejected employers. Reasons for rejecting an employer or an assignment include factors such as having a negative environmental impact, or contributing to inequality through non-inclusive practices, and more personal factors such as a lack of support for employees\u2019 mental well-being and work/life balance.\nBusinesses have an opportunity and the necessary influence to drive climate action\nProtecting the environment is the societal challenge where Gen Zs and millennials feel businesses have the most opportunity and necessary influence to drive change. And, as roughly six in 10 Gen Zs (62%) and millennials (59%) report feeling anxious or worried about climate change in the past month, Gen Zs and millennials are using their career decisions and consumer behavior to push for action.\nAround half of Gen Zs (54%) and millennials (48%) say they and their colleagues are putting pressure on their employers to take action on climate change, a trend that has increased steadily in recent years. And two in 10 Gen Zs (20%) and millennials (19%) have already changed jobs or industry due to environmental concerns, with another quarter planning to in the future.\nAs consumers, about two-thirds of Gen Zs (64%) and millennials (63%) are willing to pay more to purchase environmentally sustainable products or services. And many are taking personal actions, or plan to in the future, such as avoiding fast fashion, reducing air travel, eating a vegetarian or vegan diet, or purchasing electric vehicles.\nGen Zs and millennials are uncertain about GenAI, but positive perceptions largely increase with frequent use\nGen Zs and millennials believe GenAI will have a significant impact on their career paths and the way in which they work. Nearly six in 10 Gen Zs (59%) and just over half of millennials (52%) believe the prevalence of GenAI will make them look for job opportunities that are less vulnerable to automation, such as skilled trades or manual labor.\nUncertainty is the top emotion Gen Zs and millennials report feeling when they think about GenAI. The survey also finds that women in particular express greater uncertainty about GenAI than men do and are less likely to feel comfortable working alongside it. A lack of familiarity may accentuate feelings of uncertainty. Gen Zs and millennials who use GenAI at work all or most of the time are more likely to feel trust and excitement than uncertainty. They are also more likely to believe GenAI will free up their time, improve the way they work, and improve their work/life balance. But, conversely, frequent users of GenAI are also even more likely to have certain concerns, such as believing that GenAI-driven automation will eliminate jobs and make it harder for young people to enter the workforce.\nIn response to these types of concerns, both generations are focused on reskilling and training. However, only about half of Gen Zs (51%) and millennials (45%) say their employer is sufficiently training them on the capabilities, benefits, and value of GenAI.\nWork/life balance is a top priority\nWork/life balance remains the top priority for both Gen Zs and millennials when choosing an employer. The ability to maintain a positive work/life balance is also the top thing they admire in their peers, well above other traditional markers of success like job titles and material possessions. Yet many are not achieving the balance they seek. Around a third of respondents who regularly feel anxious or stressed say their job and work/life balance contribute a lot to their stress levels, fueled significantly by long working hours (51% of both generations), and a lack of control over how or where they work (44%).\nThe last year has seen a continued shift towards more on-site work, with nearly two-thirds of respondents saying their employers have recently implemented a return-to-office mandate, either bringing people back fully on-site or moving to a hybrid model. These mandates have yielded mixed results, with some reporting benefits like improved engagement, connection and collaboration, while others are experiencing increased stress and decreased productivity.\nDespite a dip this year, stress and workplace mental health stigma remain\nStress levels and mental health continue to be a concern, although there are some signs of improvement this year. Only about half of respondents rate their mental health as good or extremely good. And up to four in 10 Gen Zs (40%) and millennials (35%) say they feel stressed all or most of the time (down from 46% and 39% in 2023). While work is a big driver of this uneasiness, respondents emphasize their finances and the health and welfare of their family as the top stress drivers.\nEmployers are making some progress when it comes to better workplace mental health, but there is still much room for improvement when it comes to speaking openly about mental health. Nearly three in 10 Gen Zs and millennials worry their manager would discriminate against them if they raised stress or other mental health concerns, and roughly three in 10 don\u2019t believe senior leaders are prioritizing mental health in the workplace.\n\u201cGen Zs and millennials expect a lot from their employers, and from business more broadly. But what they are asking for is what most employees in the workforce, regardless of age, likely want: meaningful work within purpose-driven organizations, the flexibility to balance work and personal priorities, supportive workplaces which foster better mental health, and opportunities to learn and grow in their careers,\u201d adds Elizabeth Faber. \u201cEmployers who work to get these things right will have a more satisfied, productive, engaged, and agile workforce who are better prepared to adapt to a rapidly transforming world.\u201d\nTo learn more about the Deloitte Global 2024 Gen Z and Millennial Survey and the Mental Health Deep Dive based on the findings, please visit: www.deloitte.com/genzmillennialsurvey.\nMethodology\nThe Deloitte Global 2024 Gen Z and Millennial Survey reflects the responses of 14,468 Gen Zs and 8,373 millennials (22,841 respondents in total), from 44 countries across North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific.

      "text": "Law firms have measured lawyers' performance based on billable hours for decades. The typical range varies from as low as 800 to as high as 2,000 hours a year, though at some firms it can be even higher.\nCritics of the billable hours model are increasingly questioning the suitability of this model as a measure of performance. Some law firm leaders are advocating for change, and in-house teams are under pressure to cut costs and are asking for greater transparency around billings.\nLexisNexis recently interviewed law firms, lawyers, and clients about the pros and cons of the billable hour. The report provides valuable insights into the ongoing suitability of the billable hour model both from a law firm and a client perspective.\nOne of the problems highlighted with measuring a lawyer's performance based on billable hours is that not all hours worked are billable. According to PwC's Annual Law Firms' Survey 2022, the average recorded hours per lawyer at the top 10 firms currently sits at 1,373. This number drops down to 1,272 chargeable hours for the top 11 to 25 firms, and to 1,167 hours for the top 26 to 50 firms. Although these numbers are thought to have risen in response to recent economic events. The newly-published BigHand 2022 survey found 98% of UK law firms surveyed said they had increased target hours for lawyers, with nearly half (47%) doing so by over 10%.\nA senior lawyer in the UK who has worked in both private practice and in-house points out the most significant problem with the billable hours model. \"People who work more efficiently are unduly penalised because they bill less than someone who maybe took twice as long to do the same piece of work. We should be rewarding people for efficiency, not penalising them.\"\nAccording to Bloomberg, the most common reason for in-house teams to request alternative billing structures such as flat fees is to save costs (81%), followed by cost certainty (65%) and general efficiency (49%).\nWhen interviewed by LexisNexis, Andrew Cooke, general counsel at TravelPerk, a business travel provider, said: \"We're looking for value, not cost\".\nCooke added that he has noticed that working on a fixed-fee model tends to sharpen the mind and reduces the number of unnecessary phone calls and interactions.\nThe message is clear. Law firms should consider how they can better prioritise employee satisfaction and client value for money. Fixed fees, for example, are one way to maintain profits whilst reducing the hours required to complete work.\nHowever, fixed fees may not always be the answer.\n\"If you're a big firm doing debt capital markets transactions, you're probably doing thousands of those, and so you've got a very good idea of what your fixed charge ought to be,\" said Stephen Denyer, director of strategic relationships at The Law Society of England and Wales. \"On the other hand, if you've got a major, multi-party M&A transaction or a restructuring or a bit of litigation that could go in lots of different directions, you've got no realistic way of knowing what elements there are going to be and therefore what you ought to charge for them.\"\nGeorgia Dawson, a senior partner at global law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, says: \"It would be ideal for the industry if we can start to move towards more of a focus on outputs and the value that is being delivered by lawyers. That supports a drive towards efficiency, a drive towards the use of technology, and it can help to support a better focus on mental health, wellbeing and diversity in the profession as well.\"\n\"If you focus on outputs rather than the inputs, then people are able to manage their work in a way where they're completely focused on the quality and the value of the output for the client,\" she added.\nIn addition, switching the focus from hours billed to value delivered can improve client relationships and result in more work, according to several in-house lawyers interviewed.\nMany firms are still deciding how they feel about investing in legal technology that increases productivity. There's concern that it will reduce the number of hours billed and reduce profits. Yet, according to the LexisNexis report, many law firms are investing more in technology, with tech spend this year accelerating at an unprecedented pace.\nLegal technology could be advantageous for firms charging a flat or alternative rate, as they could charge the same or a similar rate but reduce the time spent by their lawyers. In some cases, incorporating new technology could allow firms to charge more by improving the value of their offering. Technology can also help law firms provide more accurate estimates of how much a matter will cost, reducing some of the risks of offering fixed-fee work.\n\"One of the basic aims of law tech is to speed up tasks, which doesn't really help your profitability if you're still sticking to billable hours, so firms are still coming to terms with how to feed in the law tech element,\" said Denyer. \"That is probably going to depend on how special or unique the law tech component is\u2014if you've got something that is really unusual or unique, then obviously you can potentially pitch that to a client as something that will cost more.\"\nTo that end, some firms are developing a tech-as-a-service where clients can access specific tech tools and products that can deliver legal services faster and more efficiently. Freshfields, for example, has an in-house Lab and Innovation team using data sciences and machine learning to create products that combine tech and data analytics to enhance client service delivery.\nDenyer added, \"Part of adopting technology is deepening and broadening relationships with clients and getting the client more dependent on you. Technology can potentially give you real insight into the client's issues, which gives you a chance to pitch for a lot more of their work and also makes the client more wedded to you, which means it's not going to be so easy for them to move away.\"\nBy thinking differently about legal technology (and the billable hour), you can achieve the opposite of what some law firms fear. You can improve efficiency, reduce hours, find ways to generate more client work and ultimately increase profits.\nFor more insight on the future of the billable hour, read the full report here.\n* denotes a required field\n0330 161 1234"
