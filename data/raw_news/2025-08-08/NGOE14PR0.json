  "title": "Rules That Wall Street Hates Add Hours of Paperwork",
  "description": "A wave of bankers, investment managers, and hedge fund bosses have been urging officials for years to revisit the trade-off between the cost of rulemaking and the benefit of safeguarding the financial system, with the rising workload for financial institutions theoretically looking like a net 51 million hours of extra annual paperwork from rules introduced since the Great Financial Crisis. Tom Metcalf has more in today\u2019s \u201cBig Take\u201d on Bloomberg Television. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Regulation since the global financial crisis may have added as many as 51000000 hours of annual financial paperwork for Wall Street. The increased build up has been called a waste of time by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. The estimate comes from new analysis by Bloomberg that is the subject of today's big take. Let's get more from Bloomberg's Tom Metcalf. Tom has more of the attention turned to President Trump's deregulation agenda and how risky is that likely to be in the world of finance? Yeah, look, it's certainly one of the kind of a third leg of what they're trying to do. And I think the question of risk is a fascinating one. You know, as we explore in a big take because it's so hard to know, right? There's unintended consequences. And of course, you've seen plenty of examples of regulations have potentially staved off staved off huge costs. But as you can tell from certainly Jamie Diamond's comments, generally the banking industry feels the regulations have gone too far and they're certainly pushing for a hefty rollback. And that's why this story is so interesting, because often this debate is fairly diffuse and it's, you know, just kind of based on feel. And what learning did was get out there and effectively quantify all these regulations. You're looking at 51000000 hours of additional work. And I think that will help kind of capture debate in terms of perhaps the added workload. Is it worth it? Basically, what's the point of it? Like, what's the point? What's the goal of these new moves from the Trump administration in terms of. Yeah, well, what they've come out and said is look for every new rule you want to put in, we'll take out ten. I mean that's kind of classic Trump administration move. Very dramatic how practical that is. I don't know. I mean, it's the question of, you know, are they looking to completely gut these things or is it basically a rollback? They feel things have gone too far. You know, I think the banking industry, you know, want something more measured in terms of let's roll back some of this without completely throwing everything out. But in terms of, you know, activity, so far, some regulators have already been effectively completely denuded. So it'll be interesting to see as the administration continues just how far they go. And as say, for me is if is unintended consequences is sounds great on paper sounds great to your base. But will they be so happy if a regulator could have stepped in and saved a bunch of money but didn't have the resources to do that?",

This has been called a waste of time by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. The banking industry, who believe the regulations have gone too far, is pushing for a significant rollback. The analysis suggests that the cost of these regulations could exceed $100,000.
