      "feedback": "The draft stays within the 3‑6‑month, S&P 500‑centric focus and ties every claim to the FAN5RYW6T source, but a few tweaks will sharpen its rigor: 1) The sentence about a “stronger dollar tends to weigh on U.S. equities through FX risk and higher discount rates” is a general macro rule that the XTQIQRP5K article does not explicitly support; add a citation from a credible macro source (or remove the specific “higher discount rates” claim) to avoid unsupported inference. 2) The probability language (“0–5 % probability of a 1–3 % pullback”) should be anchored to a concrete data point—e.g., the Fed’s September‑cut probability from futures or the current equity risk‑premium spread—to satisfy the “truth > verbosity” rule. 3) The watch‑list signals are clear, but explicitly link each (e.g., “September FOMC minutes” → Fed policy stance, “July CPI” → inflation trajectory, “Q2 earnings of top tech names” → concentration risk) to the corresponding source ID for traceability. 4) Finally, tighten the paragraph by removing the parenthetical “(XTQIQRP5K)” after the dollar discussion if the link is not directly supporting the equity‑FX claim, or replace it with a proper macro source ID. These edits will ensure every substantive claim is evidence‑backed, causally mapped, and fully cited.",
