  "title": "Hosepipe bans feared for winter: Predicted rainfall will NOT be enough",
  "description": "Yorkshire Water made the announcement to its more than five million customers following the news reservoirs are only a third full - well below the normal level for this time of year.",
  "content": "Hosepipe bans could last up to winter as there is not enough rainfall to let 'everyone have the water they need' despite two weeks of showers forecast this month.\n\nYorkshire Water made the announcement to its more than five million customers following the news reservoirs are only a third full - well below the normal level for this time of year.\n\nDirector Dave Kaye said: 'We're expecting more welcome rainfall over the next few days. While welcome, it is likely to be taken up by plants and the parched ground and countryside with very little making its way into our reservoirs.\n\n'Hosepipe restrictions will remain in place until reservoir stocks have recovered \u2013 this could extend into the winter \u2013 as we are planning for the short-term and to ensure we have adequate supplies heading into the spring and summer of 2026.\n\n'The efforts of customers to reduce water usage, our work to reduce leakage and the drought orders and permits we have in place, as well as others we have applied for, are all helping to reduce demand and protect the water stocks so everyone will have the water they need.'\n\nYorkshire Water's stocks are currently at 35.8 per cent - with 73.4 per cent being the average for this time of year.\n\nThames Water and South East Water also have hosepipe bans in place in some areas following one of the driest springs on record and low reservoir levels.\n\nAs a result of the ban, people may not water plants, clean cars or fill swimming pools using a hosepipe.\n\nYorkshire Water has been condemned following the announcement amid Labour MP for York Outer, Luke Charters' claim it has been 'allowed to preside over one of the leakiest water networks in the country'.\n\nA letter has also since been signed by numerous regional leaders including David Skaith, Mayor of York and North Yorkshire, hitting out at Nicola Shaw, the company's chief executive officer.\n\nIt came amid her receipt of payments of \u00a31.3million from Kelda Holdings, the firm's parent company.\n\nThe joint letter to Vanda Murray, chairman of the board at Yorkshire Water, stated the payments ought to have been 'viewed against Yorkshire Water's consistent pattern of poor performance.'\n\nArrangements were criticised as 'wholly unacceptable' and coming 'at a time when Yorkshire Water customers are facing a 41 per cent alongside environmental failures and customer service shortcomings'.\n\nYorkshire Water say the payments were for work including 'investor engagement, financial oversight and management of the Kelda Group'.\n\nIt added the fee was paid by shareholders rather than bill-payers.\n\nA Yorkshire Water spokesman said: 'We understand the strength of feeling on the items outlined in their letter and welcome the opportunity to meet the local mayors and council leaders to discuss these in more detail.'\n\nThe Met Office's forecast for September 3 to September 12 predicts 'changeable and unsettled weather conditions across the UK with low pressure systems tending to dominate the overall pattern'.\n\n'This will mean showers or longer spells of rain will affect much of the UK at times. Some heavy rain or showers are expected in places, most often in the west,' a spokesman said.",

  "summary": "Yorkshire Water has issued a warning that there is not enough rainfall predicted for the coming weeks due to low reservoir levels. The company's director, Dave Kaye, stated that while the predicted rainfall will be taken up by plants and the parched ground, there is little water making its way into the reservoirs. The ban will continue until reservoir stocks recover and could extend into winter. As a result, people cannot use hose pipes to water plants, clean cars or fill swimming pools. The announcement has been condemned by local leaders and criticised by some as being 'wholly unacceptable' and 'unacceptable'.",

  "argos_summary": "Yorkshire Water announced hosepipe bans that could last into winter as reservoir levels are only 35.8% full, far below the seasonal average. The company cites expected rainfall but warns it will be absorbed by dry ground, extending restrictions until stocks recover. The ban has sparked criticism from local politicians and a letter from regional leaders, accusing the CEO of mismanagement amid a history of leaks and service failures. Other water companies, Thames Water and South East Water, also face bans due to one of the driest springs on record. The Met Office forecasts unsettled weather with sporadic showers across the UK, but the impact on reservoir replenishment remains uncertain.",
