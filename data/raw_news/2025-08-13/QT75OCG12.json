Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2025Size: 5825U 16G/500GVerified PurchaseFirst of all, thank you Beelink for bypassing setting up a Microsoft Account and instead creating a local account at set up. Initial set up was quick and very clean. Wish more manufactures would follow this. The machine boots quickly and the extra PCIe slot is a breeze to add more storage. Lots of I/O ports and the small footprint gives my desk a simple and clean look. I've bought many Beelink mini computers for myself and friends and all are still running strong.\n- Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025Size: 8745HS 32G/1TVerified PurchaseI was extremely skeptical of the whole \"mini PC\" thing. I have been eyeing the Beelink brand computers for a while and decided to pull the trigger on this model. I bought this computer to replace an aging Windows desktop that I have used for music production for the last 15 years. This computer is an absolute powerhouse for what I am using it for. It can handle all of my plugins and VST instruments with ease. No hiccups, no freezing, and no issues running any of my software applications. The Ryzen 7 processor is extremely fast and efficient. The 32 GB of RAM makes everything run flawlessly. I initially bought a different model and ended up returning it before even opening the box because I liked that this model had an external power supply. The other model had an internal power supply and I had read that it struggled under load because of how weak the power supply was.\nI liked this computer enough to purchase the same model for my son for his first computer. He can play all of the games that he likes to play without any issues (Roblox, Minecraft, Mech Arena).\nThe small form factor is nice so that it doesn't take up a ton of space and this PC is extremely quiet and the metal construction is very slick looking. Beelink has a very nice design going with their models. Everything is built into this computer, so I no longer needed to have a wifi adapter or Bluetooth dongle taking up USB ports on the computer. The Wi-Fi is really fast and the number of display options for this computer is really impressive. I have it plugged into an HP docking station that has 2 27-inch displays connected.\nIt is amazing how quiet this thing is and is a major upgrade from my old Dell desktop that I was using. Beelink has made upgrading this computer easy, however, I don't think I will need to upgrade anything anytime soon. 32GB of RAM seems more than enough for what I am using it for. The fact that this computer can handle up to 256GB of RAM is pretty impressive.\nBeelink also did a fantastic job on the presentation and boxing of the unit. The package that came from Amazon was nice and the way everything included was presented when you opened the box made it feel like it was premium.\n9/10 - would buy it again.\nThe only thing I would have liked to see would have been a longer power adapter cable. It was slightly shorter than expected. Maybe an extra foot would have been nice. I use the computer with a standing desk and when you raise the desk to maximum height, it puts tension on the computer.\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2025Size: 5825U 16G/500GVerified PurchaseFast and reliable...I use this primarily to watch streaming video and play games using a 50 screen TV as a monitor. Works great.. takes up very little space on my TV stand.\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2022Very compact and powerful.\nPower cord is short but the cord to the unit is making up for it. Very fast and Windows 11 pro is a plus over the home version. No noise at all. Works perfect and network wise it is fine if used with a rj45 cable.\nWiFi is very slow. Don\u2019t know why yet but it is disappointing. The maximum speed I was able to reach was an avg of 10 mbps download and avg 2 mbps upload. My network should be 200mbps and 40mbps\nIt is a great computer for my purpose\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024Size: 5825U 16G/500GVerified PurchaseI was looking to replace an aging desktop with a Gen1 Ryzen 3 and 1050ti shared between two teenage kids. Saw this and was skeptical at first but took a chance.\nGlad I did since I got two for less than the price of one PC that runs all the games and apps they need. Neither is in to major graphics games biggest being some medium end Steam games or Fortnite and Minecraft but this is quite powerful is very fast, doesn\u2019t as loud or hot alike the old one.\nWindows 11 pro is great to have, plus a Ryzen 7 I was looking at for about double the price of just the processor for the old desktop. Saves desk space and the fan runs very quiet even at full speed. Their games and apps all work it\u2019s way faster than the desktop each replaced best part is I think they really appreciate the gift and each having their own computer that can be quite portable too compared to the desktop.\nLove the SSD drive option, I\u2019ll soon be putting the old SSDs in each of these for extra storage space.\nThe only thing one of the two kids wanted was an RGB fan but I\u2019ll think they\u2019ll be ok without it or worst case I\u2019ll get them an RGB mouse/keyboard.\nThis little PC is a workhorse, it is so good I\u2019m thinking of buying one for myself!\nTop reviews from other countries\n-\nSinanReviewed in Turkey on January 29, 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Canavar\nSize: 8745HS 32G/1TVerified PurchaseHarika bir \u00fcr\u00fcn.
