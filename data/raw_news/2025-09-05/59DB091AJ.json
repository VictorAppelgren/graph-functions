  "content": "Commuters face heavy disruption on their journeys to work after unions announced strikes on the London Underground.\n\nThe scale of the disruption means it will not just affect Tube travellers, as passengers are forced to find alternative ways to get to work.\n\nBarring an eleventh-hour delay, it will be the first time this year that Underground workers have walked out.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the impending disruption.\n\nWhen are the Tube strikes?\n\nThe National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) has announced rolling strikes, which are expected to hit Tube services from Sunday Sept 7 to Thursday Sept 11.\n\nTransport for London (TfL) said the whole of the network on the London Underground will be \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d from Sept 7 to Sept 11.\n\nLittle to no service is expected on those dates. There will be no services at all before 8am.\n\nIn a separate dispute, there will be no services on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) on Tuesday Sept 9 or Thursday Sept 11.\n\nIn a move that will have less impact on passengers, Ruislip depot operational managers will go on strike from 6pm on Friday Sept 5 and 5.59pm on Saturday Sept 6.\n\nUnion members are walking out in a dispute over pay and conditions, including a demand for a 32-hour working week.\n\nThe RMT said management had \u201crefused to engage seriously with union demands\u201d.\n\nIt said it had raised concerns on \u201cpay, fatigue management, extreme shift patterns and a reduction in the working week\u201d.\n\nThe union said management had also failed to honour previous agreements with staff.\n\nIt said: \u201cManagement\u2019s dismissive approach has fuelled widespread anger and distrust among the workforce, who voted in overwhelming numbers to take strike action.\u201d\n\nThe DLR dispute is also over pay and conditions.\n\nAccording to TfL: \u201cSince the ballot was undertaken, London Underground has offered a 3.4pc pay increase in the ongoing pay discussions.\n\n\u201cMembers of the RMT at London Underground have not had a say on the final pay offer, with the 3.4pc pay increase a figure in line with offers accepted by RMT in recent pay discussions across the rail industry.\u201d\n\nClaire Mann, TfL\u2019s chief operating officer, said: \u201cWe are disappointed that the RMT union has announced strike action.\n\n\u201cWe regularly meet with our trade unions to discuss any concerns that they may have, and we recently met with the RMT to discuss some specific points ...\n\n\u201cWe welcome further engagement with our unions about fatigue and rostering across London Underground, but a reduction in the contractual 35-hour working week is neither practical nor affordable.\u201d",
