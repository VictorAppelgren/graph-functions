  "title": "The Fairphone 6 no longer feels like a compromise (except in the US)",
  "description": "All\u2019s fair in love and phone repair",
  "content": "is a news editor with over a decade\u2019s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 arrives almost two years after the 5, a testament to the company\u2019s approach to the upgrade cycle. If anything, I suspect the company would be frustrated if Fairphone 5 owners were considering a new model already \u2014 these are phones to keep, to repair, and to hold on to until the bitter end.\n\nThe newest Fairphone continues the company\u2019s commitment to user-repairability, long-term customer support, and ethical production. That means compromises for the consumer: You\u2019ll find more powerful phones with prettier displays and more capable cameras for less money. But this year those compromises are smaller and easier than ever before, while the phone remains a lot better for the planet \u2014 you can\u2019t say fairer than that.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 is available now across the UK and Europe. It costs \u20ac599 / \u00a3499 for a version running Fairphone\u2019s custom Android software, which is fairly close to the stock experience, or \u20ac50 / \u00a350 more running /e/OS, a privacy-centric, Google-free version of Android made by Murena. If you\u2019re in the US, that\u2019s the only model available, and you\u2019ll have to buy it directly from Murena for $899, a price that Murena founder and CEO Ga\u00ebl Duval told me reflects tariffs on US imports. It\u2019s a substantial price difference that takes the Fairphone 6 from competing with midrangers like the Pixel 9A in Europe to flagships like the Pixel 10 or iPhone 16 in the US, making it significantly harder to justify.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing the privacy-focused /e/OS version of the phone. It might not look a million miles from stock Android, but the out-of-the-box experience is quite different. It has quick access to options to block tracking cookies within apps, fake your geolocation info, or hide your IP address, along with a \u201cWall of Shame\u201d listing your apps by how many times they try to track your activity. Murena describes it as \u201cde-Googled,\u201d which means it\u2019s built on the Android Open Source Project, but doesn\u2019t require a Google account to use, includes no Google apps by default, and should share none of your data with Google.\n\nThe app store also lets you install just about any Android app \u2014 even the Google ones \u2014 but only if you want to. That\u2019s thanks to microG, an open-source alternative to Google Play Services. The only caveats are that Google Wallet won\u2019t work for NFC payments, and that some apps are a little\u2026 janky. Most seem to work, but MyFitnessPal won\u2019t run, and a few others tend to stutter and crash.\n\nOn the hardware side, the Fairphone 6 is smaller and lighter than the 5, with a brighter and smoother 6.31-inch 120Hz display. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset isn\u2019t flagship hardware, but it\u2019s smooth enough most of the time, and with 8GB of RAM, it\u2019s powerful enough for anything except serious gaming. The 4,415mAh battery lasts more than a day, and the 30W wired charging speed is fine but unimpressive, with no wireless option.\n\nThe cameras remain a big downgrade compared to the competition. The 50-megapixel main lens and 13-megapixel ultrawide are fine for the basics \u2014 and exceeded my expectations every now and then \u2014 but they struggle in the dark, in complex lighting, or with fast-moving subjects. If you just need your phone camera to be good enough then these definitely are, but you can get much better cameras for the same money (or less) elsewhere.\n\nMore important is the phone\u2019s ability to last for years. Whether you buy from Fairphone or Murena, you\u2019ll get an extended five-year warranty. Fairphone also commits to eight years of software updates and seven Android version updates, though Murena only promises five years of software support for its version \u2014 worse than the likes of Apple, Google, and Samsung.\n\nThe phone is made from fairly sturdy plastic, with Corning Gorilla Glass 7i on the display, and feels tough. There\u2019s one big durability downside, though: it only has an IP55 rating for dust and water protection \u2014 good, but not great \u2014 which is the drawback of a repairable design that swaps glue for less watertight screws. So while the Fairphone 6 is more repairable than other alternatives, there\u2019s a slightly higher risk of needing that repair in the first place, at least when it comes to sand and water.\n\nSpeaking of: you only need a single Torx T5 screwdriver to strip the phone down to parts, which connect and disconnect with a simple push, clicking into place. You can replace the battery, display, rear cover, each individual camera lens, speaker, earpiece, USB-C port, and SIM tray (which doubles as a microSD slot for expandable storage). Spare parts are sold by Fairphone and iFixit, with a promise to stock them for years. In the US, Murena should stock them, but at the time of writing, the parts aren\u2019t on its site yet.\n\nI wanted to confirm if any idiot could pull off a repair, so I took apart every bit of the phone I could and put it back together again, which took a little over an hour and left me with a perfectly functional phone on the other side. Fairphone has some good YouTube videos to run through any given repair step by step, and it couldn\u2019t be much easier, so long as you pay attention to screwing everything back in the right order (ahem, not a mistake I\u2019d ever make\u2026).\n\nI\u2019ve been cautious to recommend previous Fairphones. The elevator pitch is great, but paying a premium for underpowered hardware is still a hard sell. But pure power isn\u2019t the differentiating factor it once was, so even if the Fairphone 6 is less powerful than its counterparts, it\u2019s still powerful enough for most of us. Still, improvements in software support and durability from other manufacturers have made Fairphone\u2019s offering less unique \u2014 though no one offers repairability like this.",

      "text": "The A-series Pixels have been very good over the past few years. And in the Pixel 9A, Google has taken a good midrange phone and made it great.\nGoogle Pixel 9A review: a midrange phone done right\nA phone for tariff-ying times.\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nIt\u2019s $499, which feels just right for what you get in the 9A. Spend a bit more for the Pixel 9, and you\u2019ll get some upgrades like a better ultrawide camera and more RAM, as well as little touches like Wi-Fi 7 rather than Wi-Fi 6E. But every time I wished for something on the 9A that it doesn\u2019t offer, I kept coming back to that price. At $499, it\u2019s easier to let go of some things than it was with, oh, the $599 iPhone 16E.\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Good\n- Robust IP68 rating\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Brighter, bigger screen\nThe Bad\n- Missing a couple of AI features\n- AI is occasionally handy, usually weird\nMore than just a list of specs, the Pixel 9A behaves like a device in a mature product line. When I transfer a Pixel Watch 2 from another Pixel phone to this one, it just works. When I use fast pair to connect some OnePlus earbuds I used with another Android phone, it just works. That hasn\u2019t always been the case with the Google phones I\u2019ve tested, but the company has done a much better job of connecting the dots in its ecosystem for this generation of Pixels. And for $499? That\u2019s a real sweet deal.\nHardware, screen and battery life\nLast year, when I reviewed the Pixel 8A at home in Seattle, I thought the screen was just fine, but my colleague Vjeran Pavic took the phone on a trip home to Croatia and declared it too dim. Fair point; Seattle\u2019s gray skies aren\u2019t much of a stress test for screen brightness. So I paid extra attention to the 9A\u2019s display, especially since Google claims it\u2019s 35 percent brighter than the previous one. It handled some rare sunny days in March well, and it might even be acceptably bright to someone who lives in a sunnier place than I do. It\u2019s also bigger, at 6.3 inches compared to 6.1 inches, even though the phone is only slightly larger than the 8A, which is a nice bonus.\nThe 9A gets another kind of upgrade in the form of an IP68 rating, which means it\u2019s dustproof and resistant to water immersion. The IP67-rated 8A was water submersible, too, but the 9A can survive in deeper water for up to half an hour. There\u2019s wireless charging, which is appreciated even if it\u2019s just up to 7.5W. And the 9A breaks from the rest of the Pixel series by setting the cameras flush with the phone\u2019s back panel, rather than on a raised bar. It\u2019s a distinct look, and I don\u2019t hate it, but the most striking thing about my review unit is the vibrant pink \u201cpeony\u201d color. This phone isn\u2019t the standard black rectangle, and I appreciate that.\nThe 9A has the biggest battery in the Pixel series with a 5,100mAh cell, and Google claims it has the best battery life of any Pixel when you use extreme battery saver mode. Battery life is good, if not outstanding. A moderate day, mostly spent on cellular data with a healthy dose of streaming video and four hours of screen time, brought the battery down around 50 percent by the end of the day. I tested the phone with the always-on display enabled full time, screen refresh rate at its highest setting, and used light mode rather than dark mode. All those battery-draining settings make the Pixel 9A\u2019s battery a lot more average.\nLike the rest of the Pixel 9 series, the 9A uses Google\u2019s fourth-gen custom Tensor G4 chipset. It\u2019s paired with 8GB of RAM, and it feels snappy. It handled Diablo Immortal without a problem, as our deputy editor Todd Haselton observed. When you remember that this is a $500 phone \u2014 with seven years of software updates at that \u2014 it\u2019s pretty impressive.\nPixel phones have really hit their stride recently\nI feel like Pixel phones have hit their stride recently. Small tweaks over the past couple of generations have added up to a big difference in day-to-day use. When I\u2019m scrambling to log into the Starbucks app while I\u2019m sitting in the drive-through, I can use face recognition to authenticate and autofill my credentials with my password manager rather than scanning my fingerprint. I can tap on a prompt to pair a previously saved set of earbuds and be confident that the process will work without manually connecting them. These small moments add up to a better experience.\nThere\u2019s plenty of AI here, too. There\u2019s the face-swapping Best Take and Add Me camera features, which come in handy every once in a while. I used Gemini Live for a somewhat helpful, if a bit awkward, brainstorming session. Related: if you know how to get a three-year-old to use the bathroom at preschool, let me know. But the 9A is missing some AI features on the other Pixel 9 phones, like the Screenshots app and call notes, which I was bummed about. It runs a smaller version of Google\u2019s on-device AI than the other Pixel 9 phones.\nPixel 9A camera\nThe Pixel 9A has good cameras for a $500 phone. There\u2019s a 48-megapixel main camera with stabilization, a 13-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a decent 13-megapixel selfie camera. Not bad, considering Apple only gives you one rear camera on the $599 16E.\nBut the 9A uses a smaller 1/2-inch sensor than the one used by the other Pixel 9 phones. You\u2019ll hit its limitations in low light, where pricier peers retain more fine detail. Portrait mode isn\u2019t too impressive either \u2014 there\u2019s a smeary look where parts of the subject should be gradually falling out of focus.\nThe 9A produced some of the most intensely flat and over-processed photos of high-contrast scenes \u2014 the kind you associate with bad HDR \u2014 that I\u2019ve seen from a smartphone camera in a while. It\u2019s not every time, and they don\u2019t look quite as bad on the phone screen, where the highlights are brighter thanks to Ultra HDR, but when you export them off your device, you lose that information in a lot of cases. If you\u2019re picky about your photo quality, this is one area where it makes sense to step up to a pricier device.\nAt its best, the Pixel 9A feels like an absolute steal. At its worst, it feels like, well, a $500 phone. Maybe the distance between $499 and $799 \u2014 the Pixel 9\u2019s going rate \u2014 isn\u2019t much if you\u2019re paying for it in installments, but it\u2019s a sizable difference if you\u2019re paying out of pocket.\nThe best endorsement for the Pixel 9A is that there\u2019s a lot you just won\u2019t notice as you use this phone. You won\u2019t notice performance or battery life, because they\u2019re fine. They\u2019re not outstanding, but they\u2019re not noticeably bad. You don\u2019t notice how seamless it is to use face recognition to open your password manager and log into your bank app. On a phone that costs half the going rate of a top-tier flagship, that\u2019s pretty damn good. And that peony pink doesn\u2019t hurt either.\nPhotography by Allison Johnson / The Verge\nAgree to Continue: Google Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, 9 Pro Fold, and 9A\nEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads.

We sometimes even have updates every month.\nCan I switch the operating system to Google stock Android?\nTechnically Yes. Please note that we do not have the means to support Google stock Android as this isn't the default software we offer on this device. In case you install Google stock Android on this phone, you may have a degraded assistance from our customer support team in case you would require service.\nHow can i get support if something goes wrong?\nYou can check our troubleshooting guides, our tutorials, connect with other users to get tips or simply write to our support team who will help you to solve your issue or get your phone fixed.

Please make sure to include your company details in the checkout and your VAT number.\nWhat is this Murena phone with /e/OS?\nMurena is the new brand for phones coming with /e/OS pre-installed. As we aim to reach more and more people looking for smartphones with privacy built-in, it is important to make it simple for people to refer to their phone, mention it to their friends and relatives, etc\u2026\nOvertime, we expect to roll out the Murena brand to more products and services.\n/e/OS remains the name of the operating system.\nWhy Murena?\nMurena is a reference to the project initial name, EELO, we had to drop some time back.\nWhen looking for a new name, we read this reference on wikipedia we liked a lot:\nMurena is a name (cognomen) used by a Roman plebeian family from Lanuvium belonging to the gens Licinia. It is supposed to be derived from the fondness of a family member for lampreys (murenae). The plebs were, in ancient Rome, the general body of free Roman citizens who were not patricians, as determined by the census. The precise origins of the group and the term are unclear, though it may be that they began as a limited political movement in opposition to the elite (patricians) which became more widely applied.\nLike those free Roman citizens who fought for their freedom, Murena aims to free people from the Big Tech control over our personal data."

      "text": "At the risk of oversimplification, I think there are two main types of phone buyers in the world. There are those who are happy to be in the market for a new device, who delight in discovering how phones have improved since they last upgraded and who can\u2019t wait to reap the benefits of better low-light camera performance, a prettier display, and more premium build quality.\nThe Fairphone 5 is less about what comes in the box and more about what you get over the years\nFairphone\u2019s latest repairable device is for people who hate saying goodbye to an old smartphone more than they like buying a new one.\nThen, there are those who hate the process of shopping for a new phone, who see it as all cost and no upside. They\u2019re the people who respond with despair when they\u2019re told that their phone has reached the end of its software support period or that it\u2019s no longer cost-effective to repair a seemingly minor hardware fault.\nFairphone\u2019s devices have traditionally been targeted at this second kind of phone buyer, but the new Fairphone 5 is more of a halfway house. You still get the modular design with a user-replaceable battery, a long warranty, and readily available spare parts. But now the phone comes equipped with technological advancements such as a modern OLED display with a high refresh rate, more robust waterproofing, and a higher-capacity battery.\nWith a starting price of \u20ac699 (\u00a3619 or around $740, though Fairphone currently has no plans to sell the device in the US), the Fairphone 5 still comes at a price premium compared to some of its similarly specced competitors. But it might be a price worth paying if the thought of having to replace your phone after a couple of short years fills you with dread.\n7\nVerge Score\nFairphone Fairphone 5\nThe Good\n- Even more repairable\n- Just as sustainably produced\n- An excellent screen, finally\nThe Bad\n- Occasionally sluggish performance\n- So-so camera\n- Not as dust or water resistant as the competition\nAlthough the Fairphone 5 is available in three colors \u2014 black, blue, and transparent \u2014 I\u2019d argue that the latter is the one every prospective owner should be considering. While the color scheme isn\u2019t as transparent as Nothing\u2019s devices, it\u2019s arguably a much more functional kind of transparency. You\u2019re not just looking at aesthetically pleasing innards; you\u2019re looking at the exposed screws and user-replaceable battery that are (hopefully) going to keep the phone functional long into the future.\nAs well as a transparent back, Fairphone also attempts to be transparent about how its devices are produced. The company pays a living wage bonus to over 2,000 workers on key production lines for the phone and attempts to source raw materials for the phones sustainably. These include Fairtrade gold and recycled aluminum, tin, nickel, zinc, copper, magnesium, indium, and plastics. In total, there are 14 raw materials that Fairphone attempts to sustainably source, and the company says that, of these materials, (which make up around 42 percent of the total weight of the phone), 70 percent come from fair or recycled sources. Fairphone isn\u2019t alone in its attempts to sustainably source more of the raw materials for its phones. Although the figures aren\u2019t directly comparable, Apple says that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is made from 20 percent \u201crecycled or renewable content,\u201d including 100 percent recycled cobalt in its battery.\nActually getting inside the phone is a simple matter of getting your fingernail under the bottom right of the cover and unclipping it. From here, you can lever out the battery without the need for any tools at all (which you\u2019ll need to do to insert a physical SIM or microSD card into the phone) or else remove the phone\u2019s other replaceable modules using a small Phillips-head screwdriver.\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, the reason it\u2019s good that you can easily remove these modules is so that you can replace them if and when they break over time. Fairphone has experimented with selling upgraded modules in the past (you could swap out the cameras on the Fairphone 3 with the improved sensors from the 3 Plus, for example), but here, the focus is on repairability, not upgradability. To that end, there are actually more individually accessible modules this time around, which is nice if you, say, only need to replace one rear camera that\u2019s broken or swap out a faulty SIM card tray.\nFairphone hopes to have spare parts for the Fairphone 5 available for the eight to 10 years it intends to support the phone with software updates and will replace faulty components under warranty for five years after purchase. The company ran out of some Fairphone 2 parts in 2020, five years after that phone\u2019s launch, and spokesperson Anna Jopp tells me the company has gotten better at managing its inventories of spare parts since then. From a hardware perspective, that means it should be possible to keep the phone operational into the next decade.\nFairphone is targeting up to 10 years of software support\nThe downside of making the phone this easy to open and repair is that it only has an IP55 rating for dust and water resistance. That\u2019s better than the IP54 rating of the Fairphone 4 (which was still resilient enough for me to use throughout an exceptionally rainy hike), but it still falls short of allowing you to fully immerse the device in water like you can do with an IP68-rated phone. Most modern phones at the Fairphone 5\u2019s price point and above carry an IP68 rating.\nThe Fairphone 5 is the first of the company\u2019s smartphones to come equipped with an OLED display, which is bright and colorful, with a nice, sharp 1224 x 2700 resolution and a snappy 90Hz refresh rate. You also get a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera this time around rather than a teardrop notch. Just do yourself a favor and head into Settings > Display > Visual Enhancement and set the color mode and temperature to \u201cNatural\u201d; the default \u201cVivid\u201d is overkill.\nAn OLED screen isn\u2019t particularly impressive or unusual for a phone costing \u20ac699 (Samsung and Google sell phones with fast-refreshing OLED screens for hundreds less), but they\u2019re more notable in the context of Fairphone\u2019s previous devices, which have typically lagged behind what\u2019s offered by more mainstream smartphones. Fairphone has successfully caught up in the screen department, and it feels good. Unfortunately, on the audio side, the phone\u2019s stereo speakers sound hollow compared to other devices.\nAlthough the screen looks much more modern, I\u2019m not going to claim the overall construction of the Fairphone 5 feels as premium as that of the competition. Although it\u2019s got an aluminum frame, its back is plastic rather than glass, which does feel less premium, even if it feels good knowing it\u2019s made of 100 percent recycled plastic. Fairphone also boasts that the phone is slimmer and lighter this time around, but it\u2019s still not as svelte as a typical smartphone these days.\nThe Fairphone 5 is powered by a Qualcomm QCM6490 paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is expandable by up to 2TB more via microSD. If that processor name doesn\u2019t sound familiar to you, that\u2019s likely because it\u2019s a chip that\u2019s generally aimed more at industrial hardware rather than consumer devices, and Fairphone says it picked it to allow for a longer support period (since it\u2019s very difficult for smartphone manufacturers to continue to release updates for a device after a chipset\u2019s manufacturer ends support).\nThe result is that Fairphone is guaranteeing \u201cat least\u201d five major Android upgrades after Android 13, which means the Fairphone 5 should be updated to at least 2027\u2019s Android 18 (or whatever it ends up being called). Then, in terms of security patches, as mentioned above, Fairphone is committing to keeping the Fairphone 5 patched until 2031 and is even aiming to extend support to 2033 for a total of 10 years of support.\nTo be clear, this is basically class-leading when it comes to Android manufacturers. Even Google currently only commits to supporting its latest Pixel phones for five years (though there are rumors this could change with the Pixel 8). Apple has historically fared better and only just stopped supporting 2017\u2019s iPhone X with OS upgrades (meaning it received five major iOS updates), but it doesn\u2019t offer any explicit promises about software support periods going forward. Fairphone has a good track record of supporting its older devices. It only recently stopped supporting the Fairphone 2 earlier this year, seven years after it first shipped. That said, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee how well Android 18 will eventually run on this device. All Fairphone is saying is that it\u2019ll run, period.\nAlthough we\u2019ve got Qualcomm\u2019s QCM6490 to thank for this long support period, I\u2019m less sold on its proficiency as a processor in a consumer device. Yes, it\u2019s technically equivalent in power to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 778G, but the Fairphone 5 tended to chug under heavy use. I never experienced a crash, nor was the phone ever unusable, but the occasional stutters when flitting between apps were noticeable on the phone\u2019s 90Hz screen.\nFast charging, if you have the hardware\nI got good battery life out of the Fairphone 5\u2019s removable 4,200mAh battery. I typically put the phone on to charge at night with around 50 percent remaining and averaged around five hours of screen-on time per charge. But you can\u2019t charge the Fairphone 5 wirelessly, which is another feature other phones like the Pixel 7A and iPhone SE offer at, or below, its price point. Fast charging tops out at a respectable 30W, though you don\u2019t get a charging brick or cable in the box.\nThe Fairphone 5 has taken a big step forward in terms of camera quality compared to Fairphone\u2019s previous devices, but the photos I got out of its 50-megapixel main camera and 50-megapixel ultrawide are far from class-leading.\nHold the phone still while taking photos, and it\u2019s possible to get shots that are sharp, clear, and colorful, but the Fairphone 5 can struggle to deal with less ideal shooting situations. If light drops, then detail quickly drops with it, and despite the optical image stabilization, I ended up with several blurry shots where I\u2019d clearly not made enough of an effort to hold the camera still. In low light, the phone produces superficially nice shots, but peer a little closer, and it looks like this is the work of aggressive processing, with a lot of fine detail smoothed out and colors artificially boosted. And despite offering the same 50 megapixels of resolution, shots from the phone\u2019s ultrawide camera end up lacking in detail.\nBut the most overprocessed shots I got out of the Fairphone 5 came from its 50-megapixel selfie camera, which almost had me thinking I had some kind of AI or beautification mode turned on. They all just looked a little too bright and blown out.\nNone of which is to say the Fairphone 5 comes with a bad camera system; I got plenty of usable photos out of it. But there are a lot of very good midrange smartphone cameras out there, and the Fairphone 5 isn\u2019t among them.\nThe Fairphone 5 is a lesson in delayed gratification.\nYes, you can get more features and better performance for less than its \u20ac699 asking price. Both the \u20ac509 Pixel 7A and the \u20ac529 iPhone SE come with speedy flagship processors, support for wireless charging, and a more robust IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. The Pixel 7A, in particular, comes with the best camera system you\u2019re likely to find at its midrange price point. And that\u2019s without mentioning the \u20ac449 Samsung Galaxy A54 and its amazing screen.\nBut the Fairphone 5 isn\u2019t the phone for people who want the best price-to-performance ratio out of the box. It\u2019s the phone for people who want the best price-to-performance ratio over time, who balk at the idea of replacing a phone just because it\u2019s developed a faulty charging port or even replacing a perfectly good phone just because a newer and shinier model is available.\nThe Fairphone 5 is not a phone for people who love buying new phones; it\u2019s for people who hate saying goodbye to their old ones.\nAgree to continue: Fairphone 5\nEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate.\nTo use the Fairphone 5, you must agree to:\n- Google Terms of Service\n- Google Play Terms of Service\n- Google Privacy Policy (included in ToS)\n- Install apps and updates: \u201cYou agree this device may also automatically download and install updates and apps from Google, your carrier, and your device\u2019s manufacturer, possibly using cellular data.\u201d\n- Fairphone Privacy Policy\nThe following agreements are optional:\n- Provide anonymous location data for Google\u2019s services\n- \u201cAllow apps and services to scan for Wi-Fi networks and nearby devices at any time, even when Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is off.\u201d\n- Send usage and diagnostic data to Google\nAdditionally, if you want to use Google Assistant, you must agree to let Google collect app info and contact info from your devices. Other features like Google Pay may require additional agreements.\nFinal tally: five mandatory agreements and at least three optional agreements.\nPhotography by Jon Porter / The Verge"

      "text": "Google has formally announced the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL, and their hardware upgrades can be summed up in two letter/number combinations: G5 and Qi2. Otherwise, there\u2019s not much to see on the outside of the phones. They mostly cost the same as last year\u2019s devices \u2014 $799 for the Pixel 10, $999 for the 10 Pro, and $1,199 for the 256GB 10 Pro XL, though Google got rid of the cheaper 128GB Pro XL variant. They also look an awful lot like last year\u2019s phones, with a few specs tweaked here and there. But we got a look at some of the new features running on these phones, including \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a bunch of AI stuff, and there\u2019s just a whole lot more going on than meets the eye.\nThe Google Pixel 10 and 10 Pro come with magnets, a new chip, and AI everywhere\nG5, Qi2, and lots of AI.\nG5, Qi2, and lots of AI.\nBut let\u2019s start with those top-line updates. In each of these phones is the new Tensor G5 chipset, the first one made by TSMC after four generations of Samsung-made, Google-customized silicon. Google says the CPU is on average 34 percent faster than Tensor G4\u2019s, and claims a 60 percent performance increase for on-device AI tasks handled by the TPU. On-device AI is a real theme across the Pixel 10\u2019s new features, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.\nThen there\u2019s the long-awaited Qi2 charging support. With apologies to the HMD Skyline, we haven\u2019t seen a major Android OEM offer proper Qi2 on a phone until now. That includes the MagSafe-esque ring of magnets on the back panel, which Google is introducing as Pixelsnap. Google will offer a couple of its own accessories at launch: a magnetic stand charger with a detachable wireless charging puck, plus a ring-type grip that also acts as a stand. There are roughly nine million different Magsafe accessories on the market that the Pixel 10 will be compatible with, too. The regular 10 and the 10 Pro will charge at up to 15W with a Qi2 charger, but only the 10 Pro XL supports the top Qi2.2 wireless charging speed of 25W.\nThere\u2019s good and bad news for the regular Pixel 10. The bad: instead of sharing the 10 Pro\u2019s big 50-megapixel main camera sensor as it has in previous years, the regular 10 makes do with a smaller sensor borrowed from the budget-friendly Pixel 9A. It\u2019s a 48-megapixel 1/2\u201d-type sensor, compared to the 50-megapixel 1/1.3\u201d-type sensor that\u2019s now reserved for the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL. The Pixel 10 also gets the 9A\u2019s 13-megapixel ultrawide, while the Pro phones get a bigger 48-megapixel sensor. But the good news is that it has a proper telephoto lens for the first time, though again, its 5x camera is a step down from the hardware offered on the Pro phones. Win some, lose some.\nSpeaking of losses: Google is taking a page out of Apple\u2019s playbook, and the versions of the Pixel 10 phones sold in the US will be eSIM-only. The physical SIM tray is replaced with the ability to use two active eSIMs at once and store eight \u201cor more\u201d eSIM profiles.\nScreens are a little brighter across the board; batteries are a little bigger, too. The Pixel 10 offers a 4970mAh battery compared to 4700mAh in the Pixel 9. The 10 Pro is actually a little lower than the regular 10, at 4870mAh, which is still a slight bump over the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s 4700mAh capacity. The Pixel 10 Pro XL gets a 5200mAh capacity, up from 5060mAh in the previous generation.\nMaybe the most notable new AI feature on the 10 series is called Magic Cue, which proactively suggests text that you might want to paste into an app or a conversation based on context. If a friend texts to ask for the address of the Airbnb you\u2019re sharing, in theory, Magic Cue will grab the address from your email and suggest it above the keyboard without any input from you. You\u2019ll be able to tap and check the email for yourself, or paste it straight into the conversation. If it recognizes that you\u2019re calling the number of a business listed on an email, like an airline you\u2019ve already booked a flight with, it can surface relevant details in the phone app, like your confirmation number. It looks like a kind of turbo-charged autofill for everything.\nMagic Cue works with first-party apps for the most part, including messages, calendar, Gmail, and the phone app, but it\u2019s also built into Gboard, so you may see text suggestions across third-party apps, too. Senior director of product management for Pixel Shenaz Zack confirmed all AI is running on-device, and while it incorporates your very recent phone activity into its suggestions, she says that it\u2019s \u201cephemeral.\u201d Zack adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to remember what you did a week ago,\u201d and that it\u2019s not saving any screen content. Zack wouldn\u2019t say whether this feature would roll out to older Pixel devices. It\u2019s one of those things that, if it works as it should, really could save you time and effort as you bounce between apps on your phone. Or it could be nothing at all! Either way, the Google Now dream lives on.\nThere\u2019s a load of other AI features here, too. On the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, the camera app will use diffusion AI models to improve detail in shots taken above 30x zoom. This isn\u2019t just an algorithm deciding whether a pixel should be red based on the pixels around it \u2014 this is full-on generative AI in the camera app. It happens after you take a picture, it doesn\u2019t work on people, and the results are tagged as being edited using AI in C2PA content credentials, which are now supported by Google Photos. Good! But holy crap is this an extinction-level \u201cwhat is a photo\u201d event. I have more thoughts about it all, but regardless of any philosophical hangups, it looked really effective in the demos I saw. What would normally look like digitally zoomed garbage became an actual usable image. Were they photos? Who can say?\nThis an extinction-level \u201cwhat is a photo\u201d event\nThen there\u2019s the lightning round of AI features. There\u2019s an AI Camera Coach, which gives you step-by-step directions to improve a particular photo you\u2019re trying to compose. Nice idea, but I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s going to use it. You can now use text prompts to edit photos in the AI-powered Magic Editor. There\u2019s also a journal app, because Google and Apple can\u2019t stop copying each other, and this one uses AI to assign a smiley face emoji summing up your daily entries and generates prompts based on what you\u2019ve written about. Creepy!\nFinally, there\u2019s an AI translator in the phone app \u2014 not a new concept. But this version uses AI to mimic the voice of the person you\u2019re talking to, so you\u2019ll hear translations in something closer to their speech rather than a robot. The effect is decent, if not spot on.\nThe Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL are available for preorder today; they\u2019ll be on shelves August 28th. The Pixel 10 starts at $799, and the 10 Pro starts at $999 \u2014 same as last year\u2019s phones. Starting at $1,199, the Pixel 10 Pro XL isn\u2019t technically more expensive than the 9 Pro XL, since it matches the price for last year\u2019s 256GB variant; you just won\u2019t find a $1,099 128GB version this time around.\nPhotography by Allison Johnson / The Verge"

      "text": "How we rate\nThe Verge reviews: how we test and review products\nProduct reviews can be a tricky thing. Every reviewer has a different style and different way of assessing a product, which is why no two reviews of the same product will ever read the same. At The Verge, we have built a reviews program that strives to standardize our reviews without abandoning the uniqueness of each of our reviewers. Below is a short guide to our methods and an explanation of our rating practices.\nGeneral reviewing\nOur reviews are, first and foremost, centered on real-life experience with the product. They are firmly based on the reviewer\u2019s experience of using the product for a substantial amount of time; they are absolutely never written off of a spec sheet or a fleeting experience with the product. Whatever the product is \u2014 a phone, laptop, TV, app, etc. \u2014 we strive to work it into our everyday lives and give the reader a picture of what it\u2019s like to use the product in the real world.\nBenchmarks and battery testing\nIn many cases, we crossbreed that anecdotal experience with systematic (or synthetic) benchmarks, especially in the realm of performance. Many of the tests are used industry-wide, with the exception of how we evaluate battery life.\nOur current battery testing method is entirely based on real-world usage. We use devices as we would use them in the real world and then come up with an evaluation based on how a device performs compared to devices we\u2019ve tested previously. In the case of laptops, we set the screen to 200 nits of brightness (or as close as we can get to that using the laptop\u2019s brightness adjustment tools) and then include what activities we did on the machine while we were evaluating its battery stamina.\nThis form of testing can produce different results for different users (which why we include how we used the device during the test), but we feel that our real-world evaluation of battery life is more indicative of how a device will actually perform when you buy it as opposed to other rundown tests that don\u2019t reflect actual device usage.\nScoring\nEvery reviewed product (unless otherwise noted) is given a score. We score a product based on a variety of performance, value, and subjective criteria. Since the score is not a weighted average, the editor reserves the right to adjust the average to better reflect the overall assessment of the product, including the price and other qualities that aren\u2019t always included in rigid rubrics. A score is best viewed as a snapshot in time that is compared to other devices available at the time the review is published; a device would likely not receive the same score if it were to be reviewed six months later, for example.\nIt\u2019s possible we may change the score in a review after it is published due to software updates or other changes. We\u2019ve only had to do that in exceedingly rare cares, and we will always include our reasoning about why a score changed if and when it happens.\nWe assume the 10-point scale is relatively straightforward, but below is a short guide as to how we view the numbers. All review scores are whole points. We no longer use half points or decimals when scoring a product.\n- Utter garbage and an embarrassment.\n- A product that should be avoided at all costs.\n- Bad \u2014 not something we\u2019d recommend.\n- Mediocre \u2014 has multiple outstanding issues.\n- Just okay. This product works well in some areas but likely has significant issues in others.\n- Good. There are issues but also redeeming qualities.\n- Very good. A solid product with some flaws.\n- Excellent. A superb product with minor or very few flaws.\n- Nearly perfect.\n- The best of the best.\nLast updated August 1st, 2022, by Dan Seifert."

      "text": "Nothing has announced the second phone under its colorful subbrand CMF: the Phone 2 Pro. Just like the first CMF phone, this is a modular handset with extra accessories you can screw into place. And also just like the first CMF phone, it\u2019s not getting an official US release.\nNothing\u2019s second modular phone reinvents the rules\nThe CMF Phone 2 Pro packs performance upgrades and new modules, but it\u2019s only compatible with one existing accessory.\nThe CMF Phone 2 Pro packs performance upgrades and new modules, but it\u2019s only compatible with one existing accessory.\nBuy the Phone 2 Pro by itself and you get a surprisingly well-specced budget Android handset, with a decent triple rear camera system, a bright 120Hz OLED screen, and 128GB of storage. But the real appeal is the array of modular add-ons: a screw-on case, a kickstand-card wallet combo, a bright orange lanyard, and a pair of swappable camera lenses.\nNothing has changed its approach a little since the Phone 1. While owners of that phone could remove its backplate to attach replacements, that\u2019s no longer an option here. Instead, covers \u2014 sold separately \u2014 are screwed on top of the phone\u2019s existing rear, which might be how Nothing made the jump from IP52 to IP54 water-resistance. The new accessories then attach to the cover, the kickstand relying on its built-in magnet and the lenses simply clicking into a plastic ring around the main camera.\nThe lenses are the biggest new addition here. Sold as a pair, you get a fisheye and a macro, each of which simply sit on top of the existing main lens. The fisheye is a little subtler than I expected \u2014 you\u2019ve got to work a bit to find a shot that really accentuates the effect \u2014 so I think the macro will see more use. Macro photography in cheap phones is usually dreadful, relying on the already inferior ultrawide cameras, and I much prefer the results I got from clipping this on.\nThe lanyard is the only accessory from the original Phone 1 that still works with the 2 Pro, and it\u2019s also the only one that doesn\u2019t require the cover to work, instead screwing into the circular accessory cover in the phone\u2019s bottom corner. I am at least 10 years too old to pull off carrying my phone like this, but I did spend a day doing so in the name of science, and felt excruciatingly embarrassed swinging it round to make a contactless payment on the bus.\nEmbarrassment aside, I love everything about the idea of the CMF ecosystem \u2014 modular tech is just fun, damn it, and especially when it\u2019s affordable too \u2014 but I have some qualms about the execution here. Requiring the cover to enable most of the modules makes it an essential purchase if they\u2019re part of the draw to you. But the tech involved is only a magnet and a bit of plastic around the camera, and it could just as easily have been built into the phone itself.\nThere\u2019s a tension between Nothing\u2019s desire to push an interesting modular ecosystem and its need to use CMF as a platform for buyers on a budget, and so the out-of-the-box experience clashes with everything else. Case in point: the Phone 2 Pro ships with a clear plastic protective case, but it\u2019s not compatible with the (less protective) screw-on covers.\nI\u2019m more annoyed by another glaring incompatibility, between the lanyard and the kickstand case. Prop the phone up in portrait mode with the lanyard attached and it raises one corner up, leaving the whole thing wobbly and unbalanced. That might be alright \u2014 it would be reasonable enough if Nothing simply didn\u2019t intend someone to attach every single module at once \u2014 except that the company\u2019s own promotional imagery shows the phone being used just like that, with both corners sitting stably on the ground.\nI also worry about longevity here. In the nine months since the CMF Phone 1\u2019s launch, Nothing hasn\u2019t added to its accessory range at all. And now it\u2019s releasing a follow-up that uses a new system and mostly isn\u2019t interoperable with the original bits. The modular ecosystem demands a range of options Nothing can add to over time, and so far there\u2019s no sign that\u2019s the plan.\nThe good news is that the phone at the heart of this all is impressive in its own right. I\u2019ve only been using it for three days or so, but performance has been smooth, the battery has comfortably lasted until the end of the day, and the cameras, including a 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, are better than I\u2019d expect at this price. There are a few small issues \u2014 especially some strangely muted colors in the viewfinder, which fortunately don\u2019t translate to the final photos \u2014 but there\u2019s not too much to complain about here.\nThe Phone 2 Pro runs the same software as Nothing\u2019s other phones, arriving on Android 15 and promising three years of OS updates along with six years of security patches. It also includes the AI-powered \u201cEssential Space\u201d introduced with the Nothing Phone 3A devices, with the same dedicated key to activate it. You can use it to take screenshots and camera captures and save them to the Essential Space along with optional voice notes and reminders. Does it need a whole button? I don\u2019t know, but it does feel like one of the more practical implementations of AI in a smartphone yet.\nThe Phone 2 Pro is available to preorder now, with an official release on May 6th, starting at \u00a3219 / \u20ac249 in Europe for 128GB of storage, rising to \u00a3249 / \u20ac279 for 256GB. In the US you can only buy it through Nothing\u2019s \u201cbeta program,\u201d which comes with a string of caveats about potential hiccups on US carriers and no after-sales support, and it\u2019ll set you back $279 for the 256GB model. The modular accessories aren\u2019t available in the US at all, and there\u2019ll only be \u201climited quantities\u201d in Europe, starting from \u00a325 / \u20ac25 for the lanyard and rising to \u00a365 / \u20ac65 for a bundle including the cover, kickstand, and lenses.\nAlongside the new phone, Nothing has also revealed a trio of budget earbuds. The Buds 2, 2 Plus, and 2A all borrow the aesthetic of last year\u2019s Buds Pro 2, including a rotatable dial on the case \u2014 though while that \u201csmart dial\u201d could control volume on the Pro 2, here it\u2019s purely decorative. Ranging from $49 / \u00a329 / \u20ac39 for the 2A up to $69 / \u00a349 / \u20ac59 for the 2 Plus, all three models include active noise cancellation and water-resistance, with spatial audio on the 2 and 2 Plus, and Hi-Res LDAC support on the Plus.\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge\nCorrection, April 29th: An earlier version of this article said the new earbuds included \u201csmart dials.\u201d These are decorative dials, not functional ones."

      "text": "Over the past few years, Apple\u2019s standard iPhone looked a little neglected. The Pro models got new chipsets, camera features, and a customizable Action Button, while the standard models made do with the leftovers.\nApple iPhone 16 and 16 Plus review: all caught up\nIt\u2019s a good year for Apple\u2019s basic iPhone, even if its AI is MIA.\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nBut this year, things are different: the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus played catch-up, and the gap between these phones and the Pro models isn\u2019t as wide as it once was.\nThat matters a lot, especially on the more basic models. If you\u2019ve been holding on to an older iPhone for the past couple of generations wondering whether this is the year to upgrade, then I think there\u2019s an easy answer this time around: go for it. It\u2019s a good year for the basic iPhone, and it\u2019s a good year to upgrade.\nBut this iPhone is still very much a work in progress. For starters, Apple Intelligence is supposedly a major component of this phone\u2019s software, and it\u2019s just not available at launch. It\u2019s out in beta now, and some features will begin to ship next month with iOS 18.1 \u2014 still marked as \u201cbeta.\u201d But it\u2019s not on the phone I\u2019m reviewing, which is running 18.0, and therefore, it\u2019s not part of this review.\nApple iPhone 16\nThe Good\n- Reliable camera with versatile photographic styles\n- Handy new Action Button\n- More RAM and a current-gen chipset\nThe Bad\n- Standard refresh rate screen\n- Camera Control is a mixed bag\nThe Good\n- Reliable camera with versatile photographic styles\n- Handy new action button\n- More RAM and a current-gen chipset\n- Big screen for big screen fans\nThe Bad\n- Standard refresh rate screen\n- Camera control is a mixed bag\nI also have mixed feelings about the Camera Control, a new button on both the Pro and regular iPhone 16 models that allows you to launch the camera, take photos, and adjust some settings. I appreciate that it isn\u2019t a Pro-exclusive feature, and boy, do I love a button. But in practice, I find it hard to use and have largely been ignoring it.\nBut the thing is, the foundational stuff is good. This year\u2019s chipset is in the same family as the one on the Pro models, which means they\u2019ll likely be on roughly the same software update schedule. The camera itself is as capable as ever, and the phone hardware itself looks great \u2014 Apple\u2019s using some saturated colors again, thank God. And it still starts at $799, so anything added this year just feels like a nice-to-have. Even if Apple Intelligence never ships, you\u2019d still have a good iPhone in your hands.\nThere\u2019s one particularly conspicuous hardware feature missing from this, a high-end phone in the year 2024: a high refresh rate screen. Only the Pro phones get smoother ProMotion displays that go up to 120Hz, while the 16 and 16 Plus are stuck in 60Hz. By now, it\u2019s a standard feature on modern smartphones from the midrange on up, and the iPhone looks awfully dated without it.\nOn principle, it\u2019s irritating that Apple doesn\u2019t offer this on the basic models, but in reality, how much that bothers you is entirely personal. I use phones with 120Hz screens for most of the rest of the year, and it\u2019s always jarring for the first few minutes when I switch back to a 60Hz screen. But I get used to it pretty quickly, and I only notice the more stuttered scrolling when I think about it. Some people will find this an inexcusable omission, and they\u2019re probably right. Some people will be perfectly happy with a 60Hz screen, and they\u2019re also right. Everyone else exists somewhere between the two.\nThe 16 and 16 Plus also miss out on the always-on display offered on the Pro models. I like being able to glance at my notifications and my wallpaper when the iPhone is idle, so I miss having the always-on display on the 16. Still, I know a lot of people who don\u2019t like it, so on balance, it\u2019s no great loss here.\nNow, if anyone is on the record as a full-fledged button supporter, it\u2019s me. I can\u2019t get enough of \u2018em. So, imagine my delight at having two new buttons on this phone \u2014 the programmable Action Button from the 15 Pro and the new Camera Control. I use the Action Button to open the app I use to sign my kid out of daycare. Usually, I have to fumble around looking for the app while there\u2019s another parent in a rush waiting behind me, so it soothes my anxious brain every time I press that button. You can program it to do all kinds of things if you\u2019re willing to learn the ways of Shortcuts. But for the rest of us, it\u2019s pretty straightforward to map it to open a specific app and leave it at that.\nI wish I had better things to say about the Camera Control. Believe me, I wanted to like it. I\u2019ve used it a bunch, and I plan to keep trying it, just in case I\u2019m missing something. But so far, I\u2019m not impressed. It\u2019s an actual button, and fully pressing it will launch the camera app. Once you\u2019re there, another full press will take a photo. It\u2019s also a capacitive control with haptic feedback \u2014 lightly pressing it will bring up exposure settings that you can adjust by moving your finger along the control.\nA note on Apple Intelligence: it ain\u2019t here. I reviewed this phone with the latest stable software update available to it, iOS 18.0, which doesn\u2019t include Apple\u2019s much-touted AI features. The company says they\u2019re arriving in October with iOS 18.1, and when that happens, I\u2019ll evaluate them and update this review. We review what\u2019s in the box, and Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t in the box.\nSurprisingly, that\u2019s the action I\u2019m most comfortable with. It\u2019s pressing the actual button and firing the shutter I\u2019m struggling with. The mechanism feels too stiff to me, and no matter how hard I try to support the phone, I end up shaking the whole device every time I take a picture. And if I linger on that light press too long, I end up changing the exposure compensation or some other setting inadvertently. I have to take my focus away from the moment and think about pressing a damn button, and at that point, what are we even doing here?\nI do like using it to launch the camera, but once I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ve mostly gone back to using the onscreen shutter. I\u2019m also using the capacitive control for exposure compensation, but I can\u2019t help feeling that I\u2019m underutilizing one of this phone\u2019s fancy new features. If this button had one job instead of two, it would be more intuitive. Still, I now have a dedicated button to launch the camera and a capacitive exposure comp dial for the camera, and I can\u2019t complain about that at all. I just wish the dual functions of this button worked better together.\nI have to take my focus away from the moment and think about pressing a damn button\nAnd while we\u2019re in the camera app, let\u2019s talk about Photographic Styles. Remember those? They\u2019re like filters for the iPhone camera, but they\u2019re applied during capture. On the iPhone 16 series, you\u2019ll have a whole new range of custom settings to help you dial in the photographic style you like. You can go into the weeds of how this works in our iPhone 16 Pro review, but at a high level, they let you adjust color cast \u2014 in service of warmer or cooler skin tones \u2014 as well as brightness and contrast. If you\u2019re one of the many people who think that iPhone photos look overprocessed lately, then this is the feature for you.\nI\u2019ve landed on a style that I like, but it wasn\u2019t easy getting there. To set a photographic style as your new default, you need to go into the system settings menu and go through a setup process where you audition four of your photos in the new style. If you just pick a new style in the camera app itself, it\u2019ll reset to standard when you leave. This is a different behavior than on previous iPhones, and it confused the hell out of me at first.\nAnd here\u2019s the bad news: you need to shoot in HEIF to take full advantage of the new styles. HEIF is a cursed file format that no other company loves as much as Apple. Most of the time, your HEIF images will be converted to JPEG when sending them outside of the Apple ecosystem, but inevitably, one day you\u2019ll have the misfortune of trying to open a .heic file on a non-Apple device and be met with nothing but sadness. I usually avoid shooting in HEIF, but you aren\u2019t able to change styles after the fact if you just shoot JPEG. Having this flexibility with the new styles is so nice that I\u2019m willing to put up with the stray compatibility issue.\nThis level of flexibility makes it kind of hard to evaluate the camera itself. I\u2019ve been shooting with a contrastier photographic style, which dials up shadows in a way I like. Along with the brighter highlights preserved by HDR tone mapping, you get an image with actual highlights and shadows \u2014 not a bunch of gray mush scrunched into a standard dynamic range space. The camera will still go a little intense with blue skies in certain circumstances, but you could play around with the photographic style settings to dial that down. I like my version of the camera app, which may be different from your version.\nMostly, I\u2019m grateful that the iPhone continues to deliver great photos in portrait mode, and I\u2019m always impressed by the video quality in cinematic mode, too. The 2x crop zoom is fine in decent lighting, and it\u2019s a handy focal length for portrait shots. Having macro focus on the ultrawide lens is nice for the occasional close-up shot, too.\nBut the iPhone 16 uses a smaller main image sensor than its Pro peers, and its low-light image quality isn\u2019t quite as good. Image quality is fine if your subjects aren\u2019t moving, but don\u2019t expect to get away with a lot if you\u2019re trying to shoot portraits or moving subjects in dim light. And out of curiosity, I compared the 5x digital zoom on the iPhone 16 with the 5x telephoto lens on the 15 Pro Max. Predictably, the Pro Max blows it out of the water. There\u2019s still no substitute for good \u2018ol optical zoom.\nI have nothing shocking to report about the iPhone 16\u2019s overall performance. The A18 chipset (and some additional RAM \u2014 thanks AI!) handles daily tasks easily. I can fire off portrait mode photos about once a second; each one has a little bit of built-in buffering time, but I never had to wait longer than that for the buffer to clear. Even if you never use the AI features Apple is promising for this phone, getting the newer chipset is a win for the regular iPhones this year and should keep this phone running smoothly well into the next four or five years.\nEven on the smaller model, the battery keeps up all day. On a day of heavier use that included streaming KEXP with Strava using GPS in the background, I still had around 30 percent by bedtime. If you opt for the 16 Plus, with its larger battery, you can stretch a single charge well into a second day. The real question will be how it keeps up a year or two down the line; Apple\u2019s recent track record here isn\u2019t great.\nIt\u2019s a good year for the basic iPhones, and that hasn\u2019t been the case over the past few generations. To be sure, there\u2019s nothing groundbreaking here, and certainly nothing you should trade in your iPhone 15 for. But if you\u2019ve been on the fence for a while about upgrading from an 11 or 12, then I think this is the year to go for it.\nYou\u2019ll get a couple of new buttons to play with, and who knows, maybe you\u2019ll get along better with the Camera Control than I did. And If Apple Intelligence arrives and proves to be the time-saving, stress-easing set of features Apple insists it will be, then this phone will be ready for it. But even if they never arrive, you\u2019re still getting some upgrades that matter in the long run. It\u2019s a catch-up year for the regular iPhone, and that\u2019s a good year to upgrade indeed.\nPhotography by Allison Johnson / The Verge\nCorrection, September 18th: A previous version of this article referred to a 5x telephoto lens on the iPhone 15 Pro; only the 15 Pro Max has a 5x telephoto lens.\nCorrection, September 26th: A previous version of this review incorrectly stated that users need to use the HEIF format to use the new Photographic Styles; in fact, you only need to shoot HEIF to be able to change styles after shooting.\nAgree to continue: Apple iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max\nEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads.
