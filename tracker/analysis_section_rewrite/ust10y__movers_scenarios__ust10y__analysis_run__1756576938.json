      "feedback": "The draft meets the 4‑line format but lacks the required depth, canonical‑handle mapping, explicit magnitude ranges, and catalyst windows; rewrite each line as a single sentence that (1) names the canonical handle (e.g., ust10y, us_mortgage_rates), (2) states the driver with a clear sign and 2‑3‑bp or % range (e.g., “UST10y rise 5‑10 bp”), (3) lists the specific catalyst window (e.g., “Fed minutes 16‑17 Sep 2025”), and (4) justifies the probability with a cited figure (e.g., “89% odds of a 25‑bp cut (97MD1FHW8)”). For the Up items, replace “Fed balance‑sheet contraction widening real‑rate differential” with “Fed balance‑sheet contraction driving UST10y rise 5‑10 bp (LF0UUL917)”; for the Down items, replace “Fed surprise rate cut or asset sale resume compressing spread” with “Fed surprise 25‑bp cut compressing spread, lowering us_mortgage_rates by 0.25‑0.5 % (LF0UUL917)”. Ensure each line’s probability reflects the cited odds (e.g., 89% for the cut, 60% for the yield rise), and include the catalyst (Fed minutes, CPI/PCE releases, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread) in the “What to watch” field. This will satisfy the requirement for explicit causal paths, handle mapping, and catalyst‑driven probabilities.",
