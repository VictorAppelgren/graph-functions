  "title": "Pickleball Paradise: These 6 Resorts Are Great For Traveling Players",
  "description": "Pickleball remains the fastest-growing sport in the U.S. In honor of National Pickleball on Aug. 8, here\u2019s six resorts with fantastic courts catering to the craze.",
  "content": "From infinity pools to rooms with swoon-worthy views, every traveler has their go-to amenities when booking a resort. But for die-hard pickleball players? Access to a good court while on vacation is non-negotiable.\n\nThe pickleball obsession is still going strong: It remains the fastest-growing sport in the United States for the fourth year in a row. While it\u2019s long been beloved by retirees, the average player age is now 34.8, with younger generations picking up paddles and joining the fun. Pickleball-centric travel is even becoming its own thing, with travel agents booking court times, organizing tournaments, and yes, even planning pickleball cruises.\n\nIn honor of National Pickleball Day (it\u2019s Aug. 8), here\u2019s a half dozen resorts that serve up epic pickleball courts and are ideal for booking if you\u2019re the type who never leaves home without your paddle.\n\nAs one of the Caribbean\u2019s premier sporting resorts, Casa de Campo Resort and Villas is a playground for active travelers who can spend their vacation golfing, sailing, fishing, playing polo. But the newly rebranded Casa de Campo Racquet Center makes the 7,000-acre stand out as it bills itself as the largest facility of its kind in the Caribbean. In addition to 11 fast-dry tennis courts and a hard surface tennis court, the center has four pickleball courts.\n\nPickleball-loving guests might also love to try out padel, a sport that\u2019s wildly popular in Europe and is garnering more interest in the United States.\n\nThe resort\u2019s team of 25 pro and junior instructors can lead private or group lessons catered to various levels.\n\nThe Inn at Rancho Santa Fe in Rancho Santa Fe, California\n\nA high-design hideout in the country\u2019s ritziest zip code, there\u2019s many ways to enjoy a leisurely afternoon at The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe. Lounge under green-and-white umbrellas at the tucked-away pool or enjoy lunch before a Mila Moursi spa treatment on the secret garden-like patio. Then, soak up some of that famous Southern California sunshine on the tree-lined pickleball courts that resort guests can reserve for free.\n\nFresh off a renovation, The Scottsdale Resort & Spa added brand-new pickleball courts to accommodate the sport\u2019s boom in popularity. After a friendly match (or a competitive showdown), guests can tee off at the nearby McCormick Ranch Golf Club or wind down at Luna Spa with a Southwest-inspired cactus blossom body wrap or a knot-kneading massage that\u2019s perfect for post-pickleball recovery.\n\nPickleball enthusiasts of all levels will find fun and competition on the courts at Rancho La Puerta, where you can play matches with your travel companions or sharpen your skills on outdoor courts with expert-led instruction. The courts\u2019 exterior lighting means p.m. pickleball matches don\u2019t have to stop when the sun goes down.\n\nSerious pickleball players should especially put this Mexico resort on their radar in 2025. For players rated 2.5 to 4.0, the resort\u2019s Specialty Pickleball Weeks\u2014running December 6\u201313 and December 13\u201320, 2025\u2014offer an immersive experience with 15 hours of small-group coaching led by renowned pros Mario Boschi, Rick Witsken, and other guest instructors.\n\nPickleball weeks will include hands-on instruction, unlimited open play, three spa treatments, on-court refreshments, and a curated welcome gift bag.\n\nA boutique stay tucked in the heart of the city\u2019s buzzing Printer\u2019s Alley, Bobby Nashville brought back a second season of its Rooftop Lounge Dinkville Pickleball in collaboration with the city\u2019s popular Dinkville pickleball community.\n\nThe rooftop court with skyline views is open through October. In between rallies on the customized pickleball court, enjoy cocktails like aptly named Pretty Big Dill tequila drink with pickle brine and habanero.\n\nGather your fellow pickleball pals and plan a stay at San Diego Mission Bay Resort, where eight waterfront courts border Mission Bay and are surrounded by palms. The courts are open to resort guests and members on a daily basis. Pickleball fans can book the Paddle and Play package that comes with two custom resort-branded paddles created in collaboration with On Holiday, plus two fresh-pressed juices and two electrolyte mixes to help you recover from a day of play in sunny San Diego.",
