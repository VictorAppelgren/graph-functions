  "content": "President Donald Trump is taking the nation\u2019s largest banks and what ensues just may affect average Americans. Trump claims that many banks have an unfair bias against political conservatives and businesses that are traditionally aligned with the right wing, such as oil and gas companies and gun manufacturers.\n\nRead Next: 5 Ways Trump\u2019s \u2018Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019 Could Impact Your Wallet\n\nFind Out: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\n\nBut is there any merit to Trump\u2019s claims? And more importantly, could these implications affect you directly? Here\u2019s what could happen to you as Trump takes on the big banks.\n\nWhat Is Trump Really Claiming?\n\nIn an Aug. 5 interview with CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d Trump specifically targeted JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. According to Trump, at some unspecified date, JPMorgan Chase told him he had to move \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in cash\u201d to another bank within 20 days.\n\nAfter that, Trump attempted to \u201cdeposit a billion dollars-plus\u201d with Bank of America, but was denied, with the bank refusing to open an account on his behalf.\n\nAccording to Trump, \u2033[Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan] said, \u2018We can\u2019t do it.\u2019 So, I went to another one, another one, another one. I ended up going to small banks all over the place. I mean, I was putting $10 million here, $10 million there.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has taken on banks. One of his first actions after he took office back in January 2025 was to call out B of A and Chase for refusing to serve conservatives. While speaking about Moynihan, Trump took the chance to call out JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon as well, saying \u201cyou and Jamie and everybody, I hope you\u2019re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\u201d\n\nThis time, however, the rhetoric is moving towards actual policy. On Aug. 7, the president took action, issuing an executive order to combat this so-called \u201cdebanking.\u201d As reported by Reuters, the order is intended to prevent banks from refusing financial services to anyone based on religious or political beliefs. The order gives regulators 180 days to review banks\u2019 practices for unfair, discriminatory practices.\n\nHow Have the Banks Responded?\n\nNot surprisingly, the banks Trump is targeting have fought back, saying that they don\u2019t discriminate in any way when it comes to opening accounts. In fact, they\u2019ve gone the extra step of saying they \u201cwelcome\u201d any type of regulation that makes banking a more even playing field for everyone.\n\nJPMorgan Chase spokesperson Trish Wexler issued a statement responding to Trump\u2019s claims, saying \u201cWe don\u2019t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed. We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.\u201d",

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d which has passed in the House of Representatives, has sparked fierce debate. While the bill promises growth and relief in some areas, it also introduces cuts, cost shifts and structural changes that could impact everything from healthcare premiums to loan payments \u2014 and affect the budgets of everyday Americans.\nHere are five key ways this sweeping legislation could affect your wallet.\nMaking the 2017 Tax Cuts Permanent\nOne of the bill\u2019s most consequential provisions is the move to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Experts said these tax cuts could extend financial relief to many individuals and families, encouraging long-term economic growth.\n\u201cThese tax cuts provide much-needed relief to small businesses and individuals and encouraged billions of dollars in economic activity and investment,\u201d said Javier Palomarez, founder and CEO of the United States Hispanic Business Council. \u201cExtending these cuts would allow businesses to invest and grow at a faster rate.\u201d\nHe explained that these cuts could have a positive impact overall. \u201cExtending these cuts could have a far greater, and a more positive impact than changes to SNAP or Medicaid,\u201d he said.\nRising Mortgage and Loan Rates\nOne overlooked consequence of the bill is how it could quietly raise the cost of borrowing across the board. From home mortgages to car loans, everyday Americans could find themselves paying more to afford basic milestones.\n\u201cThe proposed legislation could increase your expenses by increasing your mortgage payments for a house,\u201d said Steven Conners, founder and president of Conners Wealth Management. \u201cMortgage rates are high but still going up. Furthermore, this doesn\u2019t count higher loan rates for car loans and other purchases that are more significant in price, where we ordinarily buy them through a loan which is based off the bond market.\u201d\nHe added that the bond market is already reacting to the bill, signaling that borrowing costs could keep rising. With national debt on the rise and no clear ceiling for interest rates yet, Conners said that the overall trend points toward more expensive loans.\nReduced Access to Health Subsidies\nAccording to a bill analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, by 2034, about 16 million people could lose health coverage and become uninsured due to a variety of proposals in the bill, including Medicaid cuts.\nMiddle-income families who rely on Affordable Care Act (ACA) support or Medicaid expansion could also be affected. \u201cPremiums will most likely increase,\u201d Conners said. \u201cFor those less fortunate, Medicaid will see less funding, which ultimately puts more pressure on this part of the population.\u201d\nSmaller Food Budgets\nWorking families who rely on SNAP benefits could feel the sting of the bill almost immediately. A combination of benefit reductions and new restrictions could make it more difficult for many households to afford sufficient food.\n\u201cThe most immediate impact will be the reduction of benefits received by those enrolled in SNAP,\u201d Palomarez said. He explained that these cuts, as well as the administration\u2019s push to have states restrict SNAP-eligible items, could result in strained food budgets for many Americans.\nWhile many assume that cutting SNAP benefits would affect only low-income households, the impact can ripple across entire communities and state economies.\nA Commonwealth Fund analysis found that reduced food assistance can lead to job losses and decreased business activity, even in places far from where the cuts occur. For instance, groceries purchased in Georgia might support farmers in Kansas or processors in Tennessee, and a clinic closure in Louisiana could result in a nurse losing her job in Texas, per The Commonwealth Fund.\nPBM Reforms and Lower Drug Prices\nOne of the bill\u2019s measures targets the opaque practices of pharmacy benefit managers.\n\u201cCertain provisions related to pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reform have the potential to significantly lower prescription prices for everyday Americans,\u201d Palomarez said. \u201cUnlike the strict price control measures threatened by the administration earlier this year, the Big Beautiful Bill relies on transparency with consumers and mandated reporting to NADAC to ensure consumers can make the most informed decisions.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

      "text": "Warren Buffett Is Investing In Gas and Oil: Why Cheap Energy Companies Should Be In Your Investment Portfolio\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nOil and gas stocks have been a roller coaster ride lately, with prices dropping during the pandemic. Then, it rose when supply was tightened, and people began moving around again. The unrest in the Middle East has driven prices up of late, but the volatility of that situation points to an uncertain future. The sector also faces competition not only from within but from the producers of sustainable energy like hydrogen, wind and solar, including the electric vehicle production.\nIn keeping with his philosophy of being fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful, Warren Buffet has been buying up traditional oil and gas stocks. Should you follow suit?\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\nOil and Gas Stocks in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Portfolio\nBuffett has significant positions in two major oil and gas companies in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. (He also has investments in several Japanese trading firms that often hold energy imports, among other investments.) Berkshire\u2019s big oil and gas holdings are Chevron Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp.\nChevron Corp.\nBerkshire Hathaway owns $20 billion of Chevron Corp. (CVX) stock, making the conglomerate the third largest shareholder of the energy company. That said, Berkshire Hathaway cut its investment in Chevron by over 20% in the first quarter of 2023.\nChevron refines and sells gasoline, diesel, lubricants, fuel oil additives and more. It owns refineries and a network of service stations under the Chevron and Texaco brand names.\nChevron reported disappointing earnings in the third quarter of 2023, with revenue of $52.77B, down 17% year over year. Net income was down 42% over the same period last year at $6.53B. And diluted EPS was $3.48, down 40% from the third quarter of 2022. The stock dropped over 6% when earnings were announced on October 27, 2023.\nOccidental Petroleum Corp.\nBerkshire Hathaway owns nearly a quarter (24.4%) of stock from Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY). Buffett boosted Berkshire\u2019s holdings to over 210 million shares earlier this year.\nOccidental Petroleum explores, develops, and produces oil, liquid natural gas, natural gas, and condensate. It transports, stores and markets these products, in addition to carbon dioxide and power. It also makes and markets vinyls and basic chemicals.\nOccidental Petroleum had not announced its fourth fiscal quarter earnings as of October 30, 2023, but the estimate was for EPS of $0.89 compared to $0.68 in the prior quarter.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy\nBerkshire Hathaway has a privately held energy subsidiary that includes producers, transporters, and providers of renewable and traditional energy. Its businesses include:\n- PacificCorp, the largest grid owner-operator in the West, with two million customers in six states.\n- MidAmerican Energy Company, a utility that provides wind, coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydro and biomass energy to customers in Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota.\n- NV Energy, which provides electricity to about 90% of the state of Nevada and natural gas to nearly 200,000 customers in the Reno area.\n- Northern Power Grid, a distribution network operator in the U.K.\n- Northern Natural Gas, whose pipelines cross 11 northern U.S. states and provide transportation and storage of natural gas to 83 utility companies.\n- BHE GT&S, a standalone subsidiary with three interstate pipeline systems and other natural gas transportation and storage infrastructure. This business recently purchased a 50% stake in Cove Point LNG, LP, which owns and operates transportation facilities for liquid natural gas.\n- Kern River Gas Transmission Company, which operates 1,400 miles of pipeline between the Rocky Mountains and western markets.\n- BHE Renewables, which develops solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal products.\n- AltaLinkd, which supplies electricity to over 85% of the population of Alberta, Canada.\n- BHE U.S. Transmission owns and acquires existing electric transmission systems.\nThe interesting thing about Buffett\u2019s energy holdings is that although he\u2019s heavily invested in oil and gas, he also has companies within the conglomerate that are in the business of renewable energy production. Buffett\u2019s position seems to be that while oil and gas are moving out of favor due to their negative impact on the climate, they will still be around for a while. As the world moves to more renewable energy sources, some of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s subsidiary companies will be positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for so-called \u201cgreen and clean\u201d energy. Stock positions, which he has in Chevron Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., can be quickly and easily divested, while production and transportation facilities for energy are a longer-term proposition."

It might take more money than you think to reach this income tier. The Pew Research Center defines the middle class, or middle-income households, as those with incomes that are two-thirds to double the U.S. median household income.\nHowever, because the cost of living and average income vary so widely from state to state, the income needed to be \u201cmiddle class\u201d in one state could be much more or less than what it takes to be middle class in another.

      "text": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the two largest American banks previously rejected him as a customer, reviving claims that conservative clients were being unfairly denied accounts.\nTrump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in a wide-ranging interview that JPMorgan Chase informed him he had 20 days to move \"hundreds of millions of dollars in cash\" to another bank. He didn't say when this happened.\nThe president said he then approached Bank of America to \"deposit a billion dollars-plus\" and was told the bank couldn't provide him an account, Trump said.\n\"[Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan] said, 'We can't do it,'\" Trump said. \"So I went to another one, another one, another one. I ended up going to small banks all over the place. I mean, I was putting $10 million here, $10 million there.\"\nShares of the two banks dipped more than 1% in afternoon trading.\nSome conservatives, crypto executives and religious organizations have claimed to be unfairly \"de-banked\" by large U.S. financial institutions. Banks generally deny rejecting clientele based on political or religious beliefs, but say they are required to comply with federal laws aimed at preventing financial crimes, including the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, and have faced regulatory pressure related to crypto and other industries that are considered higher risk for money laundering or fraud.\nThe topic came up again in January, when Trump accused Moynihan of denying services to conservative customers.\nBanks in a bind\nThe issue puts banks in a bind; the companies risk further angering the president as he airs grievances that resonate with his supporters. At the same time, banks have been a major beneficiary of the Trump administration's efforts to roll back Biden-era regulatory rules across a wide swath of financial activities.\nThe Trump administration is preparing an executive order that threatens the industry with fines if they drop customers on political grounds, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. A draft version of the order asks regulators to investigate whether banks violated laws, according to the Journal.\nA trade group for big banks said that \"regulatory overreach\" was the root cause of the de-banking problem.\n\"Banking agencies have already taken steps to address issues like reputational risk, and we're hopeful that any forthcoming executive order will reinforce this progress by directing regulators to confront the flawed regulatory framework that gave rise to these concerns,\" the Bank Policy Institute told CNBC.\nWhile Trump on Tuesday mentioned his business, likely referring to his real estate and hospitality conglomerate, it wasn't clear if the events he described were in reference to personal or business accounts, or both.\nTrump said that he believes banks rejected him and his supporters because regulators during the Biden administration applied pressure to the companies.\nIn a March lawsuit filed against Capital One, the president's company alleged that the bank improperly closed more than 300 accounts a few months after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. The bank denied the accusations.\nJPMorgan denied targeting conservatives or Trump supporters for de-banking.\n\"We don't close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,\" a JPMorgan spokeswoman said Tuesday. \"We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.\"\nIn a broadcast interview later Tuesday, Moynihan told CNBC that Trump was \"after the right thing\" in terms of criticizing an industry that is beholden to a web of regulations.\n\"We bank everybody, but the reality is, we want to make sure that the rules and regulations don't cause decisions we make that then are looked at in the aftermath\" and questioned, Moynihan said."
