  "title": "Washington, DC has only itself to blame for Trump\u2019s law-and-order takeover",
  "description": "The bumbling local government\u2019s failures means that Washington, DC, has never been a worthy seat for the world\u2019s greatest and most powerful nation.",
  "content": "At its best, Washington, DC, is a city of grandeur, of iconic monuments and world-historical centers of power.\n\nAt its worst, it\u2019s a harrowing place where a 14-year-old could steal your Hyundai.\n\nThe confluence of these two truths in the terrible early-morning beating of the DOGE employee Edward Coristine, known by his sobriquet \u201cBig Balls,\u201d has prompted President Donald Trump to federalize the DC police and deploy the National Guard.\n\nThe software engineer played a significant role in the frenetic push to reform the federal government that dominated the beginning of Trump\u2019s second term and, by virtue of being in the wrong place at the wrong time (and protecting a young woman), was violently attacked by teenagers within two miles of the White House.\n\nThe metropolitan government of Washington has never been worthy of the seat of government of the greatest and most powerful nation that has ever existed.\n\nIt\u2019s consistently been an embarrassment and, for decades now, has tolerated \u2014 and, worse, created the conditions for \u2014 disorderly and dangerous streets.\n\nThe late historian Fred Siegel wrote how \u201csocial license and economic restrictions,\u201d what he calls \u201cthe two halves of sixties liberalism,\u201d drained cities like Washington, DC, of their vitality.\n\nOver-regulated and inefficient, they were saddled by a \u201cstate-supported economy of social workers.\u201d\n\nOn top of this, in the 1970s, DC experienced \u201cblack nationalism in power,\u201d especially in the person of the catastrophic, long-time mayoralty of Marion Barry.\n\nThe federal government had to put a financial control board in charge in the 1990s to bring the District back from the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nIndeed, in the scheme of things, Trump\u2019s intervention is more the norm than the exception in DC\u2019s history.\n\nIn the 19th century, Congress governed the district via committees, before trying home rule in 1871 and quickly pulling back after the district was \u2014 yes \u2014 financially mismanaged.\n\nDC has had home rule since 1973, with the financial board exercising significant power from 1995 to 2001.\n\nThe district is better off now than in the bad old days of the 1990s, but remains beset by a soft-minded progressivism on matters of law and order that is an ongoing threat to public safety.\n\nAs usual, Trump is opting for the sledgehammer over the scalpel.\n\nStill, his indictment of DC for allowing lawless young people to blight the city is accurate.\n\nBut, the critics object, violent crime is falling in Washington!\n\nYes, it is, although from an unacceptably high level.\n\nAs of 2024, DC had the fourth-highest homicide rate of all major US cities and a higher homicide rate than all 50 states.\n\nAs Charles Lehman of the Manhattan Institute points out, its homicide rate for young black men has been above the national average for decades now.\n\nThe killings overwhelmingly involve young black men who have already been entangled in the criminal-justice system, with substantial rap sheets and often prison time.\n\nLehman cites a report by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform that found about \u201c500 identifiable people\u201d are in this category, and account for 60% to 70% of all the gun violence in the city.\n\nThe carjackings, meanwhile, tend to be carried out by minors.\n\nAccording to Lehman, DC needs more cops who are more active making stops and arrests, as well as more prosecutions.\n\nIt also should be targeting the relatively small group of people most prone to violence, and the city\u2019s gangs.\n\nAll of this, coupled with cleaning up homeless encampments, could continue the recent favorable crime trends and make the city feel like a better, safer place.\n\nIt\u2019s probably too much to ask Washington, DC\u2019s government to meet the soaring, implicit standard of its most famous buildings.\n\nBut not having to fear roving bands of young thugs would be a step in the right direction.",

  "summary": "The beating of DOGE employee Edward Coristine, known as \"Big Balls,\" has led President Donald Trump to federalize the DC police and deploy the National Guard. This move follows a trend of law-and-order infighting within Washington, DC. The city has been criticized for being overregulated and inefficient, leading to a disorderly and dangerous street. Critics argue that violent crime is falling, but DC still has the highest homicide rate of all major US cities and a higher homicide rate than all 50 states.",
  "shortSummary": "Washington, DC, is a city of grandeur but a dangerous place plagued by violent crime and under-regulation, prompting President Donald Trump's intervention to address it.",

      "text": "Democrats howling at Texas redistrict push should take a look in the mirror\nLet\u2019s take a tour of the 13th Congressional District in Illinois.\nIt starts in East St. Louis and then moves steadily north.\nBy the time it gets to Springfield, home of Abraham Lincoln, about 90 miles away, it takes a sharp turn to the east, reaching Decatur and finally Champaign, itself about 80 miles away from Springfield.\nIt\u2019s a jagged, narrow strip of territory with no obvious rhyme or reason as it traverses six counties.\nIt\u2019s less a congressional district than a road trip, and bears a resemblance to the original gerrymander, a long, salamander-like state Senate district in Massachusetts in 1812.\nThe only point of the new 13th District lines, fashioned in the redistricting after the 2020 Census, was to gather together far-flung Democrats to create another Democratic congressional district.\nMission accomplished: The 13th went from being a competitive district long held by a Republican to flipping to the Democrats in 2022.\nOverall, Illinois lost one district after the 2020 Census and managed to write lines that changed the congressional ratio from a 13-5 Democratic advantage to a 14-3 Democratic advantage.\nThe political analysis website 538 called the new map \u201cthe worst gerrymander in the country drawn by Democrats.\u201d\nThis makes it especially inapt that a contingent of Texas Democrats fleeing the Lone Star State to try to stop what they consider unfair new congressional boundaries found a safe harbor in Illinois.\nNext time, their travel agent should do a hypocrisy check before booking a destination.\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker welcomed the self-exiling Democrats and hailed their courage.\nHe told them that he and other top Democrats in the state were pleased \u201cto stand in solidarity with you and send a clear message to all Americans.\u201d\nHis conscience showed no sign of being pricked by the fact that he signed into law the redistricting that saw Republicans in 2022 win nearly 44% of the popular vote in Illinois congressional races \u2014 and only 18% of the congressional seats.\nA special session of the Texas Legislature is considering new lines that could net Republicans another five House seats.\nGov. Greg Abbott has cited a Department of Justice letter saying that some of the current districts need to be redrawn because they represent unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. (The Biden Justice Department had been fighting Texas because, in its view, the current lines didn\u2019t reflect enough racial gerrymandering.)\nThe Supreme Court is taking up a Louisiana case that should clarify the extent to which states can consider race in drawing so-called majority-minority districts.\nIn the meantime, the partisan effect of the new Texas lines before the 2026 midterms is unmistakable: If Republicans were likely to lose five seats from this redistricting, there\u2019s no doubt that the state\u2019s Republican governor and Republican legislature wouldn\u2019t be undertaking it.\nDrawing district lines is an inherently political enterprise, and parties tend to give themselves the best of it.\nWhen Democrats controlled the Texas Legislature, they maintained congressional lines in their favor.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2002, when Republicans won the statehouse for the first time since Reconstruction, that the GOP could redraw the congressional map \u2014 and Republicans subsequently won a majority of Texas congressional seats in 2004, also for the first time since Reconstruction.\nSince Democrats gerrymander too, they have limited options for retaliating against Texas.\nPritzker says he may redraw his state\u2019s lines, but this would require gerrymandering on top of his current gerrymander.\nGov. Gavin Newsom is making similar noises, but the California map is already tilted toward Democrats: Republicans won nearly 40% of the congressional vote in the Golden State in 2024, but only about 17% of the seats.\nIf the Texas plan goes through and all else remains equal, the Lone Star State will have about the same partisan skew as California.\nLess gerrymandering would be better than more, but Democrats like Pritzker, who blessed his state\u2019s meandering 13th District, have no standing to make the case.\nTwitter: @RichLowry"

      "text": "US military preparing to surge National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to fight local crime and youth violence: report\nThe US military is preparing to activate hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, DC, as a part of President Trump\u2019s sweeping federal crackdown on crime in the nation\u2019s capital, according to authorities.\nTrump has yet to make a final decision about the activation of federal troops, but the National Guard is readying to deploy them, two US officials with knowledge of the operation confirmed to Reuters.\nThe preparation comes as 120 FBI agents from across the country have already begun patrolling DC streets overnight and backing up area cops at carjacking hot spots, despite many lacking local patrol work training, the Washington Post reported.\n\u201cBe prepared! There will be no \u2018MR. NICE GUY.\u2019 We want our Capital BACK,\u201d Trump wrote in a post Sunday on Truth Social ahead of a planned White House press conference Monday morning about the city\u2019s cleanliness and general condition.\nThe possible order follows Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\u201d executive order signed on March 28, which established a task force dedicated to fighting crime and reducing illegal immigration in the city.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong,\u201d Trump wrote in the social media post \u2014 comparing the action to his illegal immigration crackdown at the border.\n\u201cThe Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive,\u201d Trump said in a different post Sunday.\nBowser has since fought back on Trump\u2019s characterization of the city.\n\u201cIf the priority is to show force in an American city, we know he can do that here,\u201d Bowser said on MSNBC Sunday morning. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be because there\u2019s a spike in crime.\u201d\nViolent crime is down 26% compared with this time in 2024, according to DC police data, and there have been roughly 20% fewer juvenile arrests this year, the Washington Post reported.\nHowever, the White House isn\u2019t backing down \u2014 noting that the city\u2019s \u201cbeen plagued by petty and violent crime for far too long,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\nUS Park Police arrested more than half a dozen perps in the capital on charges including possession of stolen firearms and illicit drugs as part of a federal crackdown launched by the Trump administration Thursday to clean up the nation\u2019s capital.\nEight culprits were arrested in the surge and two handguns were confiscated from offenders with prior felony convictions, Park Police Fraternal Order of Police chairman Kenneth Spencer told The Post Friday.\nAt least 30 \u201cfraudulent oxycodone pills\u201d \u2014 which appeared to be fentanyl \u2014 were also seized, along with 210 grams of crack cocaine, 600 grams of marijuana, 64 grams of hashish oil and cash with a total value of $3,600, Spencer added.\nThe show of force was in part sparked by the beating of a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer who was bloodied by a mob of 10 minors last Sunday as he thwarted a carjacking attempt in the nation\u2019s capital, according to DC police.\nEdward Coristine, whose LinkedIn handle earned him the nickname \u201cBig Balls\u201d at DOGE, was with a woman near downtown DC when he saw the group of juveniles approach their car and \u201cmake a comment about taking the vehicle.\u201d\nTrump and Coristine\u2019s former boss Elon Musk shared a photograph of the aftermath of the assault on Coristine early Tuesday afternoon, showing the former DOGE staffer sitting on the ground, bloodied and with his ripped shirt barely hanging on his body.\nCritics and residents have fired back at Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown and removal of the homeless as inhumane.\n\u201cThat money could be better spent getting folks housing and support,\u201d Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center, told the Washington Post.\nIt is not yet clear what exactly federal troops would do, but they could be deployed to protect federal agents or even carry out administrative tasks to free up law enforcement, officials said.\nWith Post wires"

      "text": "Eighty years ago, in one of the most consequential understatements of all time, Emperor Hirohito told the people of Japan that \u201cthe war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan\u2019s advantage.\u201d\nHe was originally going to say that \u201cthe war situation has deteriorated day by day,\u201d but that was considered too strong \u2014 even after the United States had dropped the atom bomb on two Japanese cities.\nWhether it was justified to use the bomb constitutes one of the most controversial historical questions in American history, but it was clearly the right call.\nIt\u2019s nice to think that Imperial Japan would have decided to surrender on the same timeline without Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but there is no evidence of it.\nThe Japanese had a strong strategic commitment to defeating or inflicting a severe blow against a prospective American invasion.\nThen, they\u2019d have the leverage for a negotiated peace on favorable terms.\nThe A-bomb scuppered these plans.\nCritics of President Harry Truman\u2019s decision have suggested it was the start of a Soviet invasion at the end that convinced Imperial Japan to capitulate.\nOr, if only we\u2019d offered more temperate terms rather than demanding unconditional surrender, Tokyo would have been much more reasonable.\nIn his definitive account, \u201cDownfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire,\u201d Richard Frank dismantles these notions, noting that nothing in the record supports them.\n\u201cNot only has no relevant document been recovered from the wartime period, but none of them,\u201d he writes of Japan\u2019s top leaders, \u201ceven as they faced potential death sentences in war-crimes trials, testified that Japan would have surrendered earlier upon an offer of modified terms, coupled to Soviet intervention or some other combination of events, excluding the use of atomic bombs.\u201d\nIn his message, Hirohito said that \u201cthe enemy has begun to employ a new and cruel bomb, causing immense and indiscriminate destruction, the extent of which is beyond all estimation.\u201d\nThe Japanese prime minister at the end of the war, Kantar\u014d Suzuki, recalled in December 1945 that the war cabinet didn\u2019t believe the Americans could win the war based on air power alone.\nThen, the atomic bomb demonstrated that, to the contrary, the United States \u201cneed not land,\u201d and \u201cso at that point they decided that it would be best to sue for peace.\u201d\nEven after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there were divisions in the war cabinet about surrender, which is why the intervention of the emperor was necessary.\nThere was still resistance after he made his decision and a coup attempt.\nThe end of the war made unnecessary a US invasion that could have meant hundreds of thousands of American casualties; saved millions of Japanese lives that would have been lost in combat on the home islands and to starvation; cut short the brief Soviet invasion (that alone accounted for hundreds of thousands of Japanese deaths); and ended the agony that Imperial Japan brought to the region, especially a China that suffered perhaps 20 million casualties.\nBequeathed with untold power by the new weapon, it is telling that we used the bomb to bring an end to a terrible war and didn\u2019t use it to dominate Europe, or for other cynical purposes.\nInstead, our nuclear umbrella became part of a security arrangement that endured for decades, defending the free world from the Soviets and preventing the re-occurrence of world war.\nNow, with further nuclear proliferation in prospect (although thankfully delayed in Iran) and the chances of great power conflict rising, it is becoming more likely that nuclear weapons will be used again.\nThis is why President Donald Trump\u2019s vision of a Golden Dome to protect the U.S. from missile attack is so important, and why we need a robust nuclear force to deter our enemies.\nEighty years ago, the atom bomb was the peacemaker in a horrific conflict that killed millions.\nNext time, it could be an instrument in the hands of an irrational regime, or rival nation bent on the destruction of American power.\nBeware.\nTwitter: @RichLowry"

We are seeing kids as young as nine and ten getting involved in carjackings,\u201d District At-Large Councilmember Robert White Jr. said during a town hall discussion in February 2024.\nDC Mayor Muriel Bowser attempted to address the rising juvenile crime concerns by imposing an 11 p.m. curfew for those under 18 \u2014 with some areas imposing restrictions as early as 7 p.m.\nTrump initially threatened to regain control of DC back in February, telling reporters the feds were needed to help bring down crime and homelessness.\n\u201cI think we should take over Washington, DC \u2014 make it safe,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One at the time.\nThe District was granted the power to elect a mayor and city council by the 1973 Home Rule Act, but Congress does still exercise considerable authority over the inhabitants.\nIn 2023, Congress passed \u2014 and then-President Joe Biden approved \u2014 a law blocking a revision to the DC criminal code that would have lowered maximum penalties for certain violent crimes, including carjacking and armed robbery.\nOn July 24, Trump signed an executive order urging states and cities to place homeless people suffering from drug addiction and mental illness into \u201ctreatment centers.\u201d\nTrump has made similar threats against New York City should democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani win the November mayoral election.\n\u201cIf a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same,\u201d he told The Post during a cabinet meeting last month.\n\u201cBut we have tremendous power at the White House to run places where we have to.\u201d"

Some jurisdictions do not allow for the exclusion of certain warranties or certain limitations on damages and remedies, accordingly some of the exclusions and limitations described in these Terms may not apply to you.\n19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Trump putting more feds on DC streets in response to out-of-control youth violence\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is planning to deploy federal law enforcement on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital as early as Friday to crack down on violence committed by gangs of roaming \u201cyouths,\u201d the White House confirmed to The Post.\n\u201cDC residents can expect to see an increase in federal enforcement starting as early as tomorrow,\u201d an administration official said Thursday, adding that operational details were still being finalized.\nThe move comes after a well-known former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, Edward Coristine \u2014 also known as \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was attacked by teenagers as he intervened to thwart an attempted carjacking near Dupont Circle, about a mile north of the White House.\nCoristine, 19, was beaten up and bloodied by about 10 juveniles at approximately 3 a.m. on Sunday. A picture of the injured staffer was posted by Trump and Coristine\u2019s former supervisor, Elon Musk, earlier this week.\nNational Guard vehicles were spotted outside the DC armory Thursday morning in apparent preparation for Trump\u2019s announcement. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are also preparing to deploy personnel, according to CNN.\n\u201cWashington, DC is an amazing city, but it has sadly been plagued by petty and violent crime for far too long,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump is committed to making our Nation\u2019s capital safer and even more beautiful for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.\u201d\nThe expected order follows Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\u201d executive order signed on March 28, which established a task force dedicated to fighting crime and reducing illegal immigration in the city.\nThe EO calls for the Trump task force to work with the Metropolitan Police Department in recruiting and retaining police officers, collaborate with local entities to reduce fare evasion on the DC metro and deploy more officers in select crime-ridden areas of the capital.\nMayor Muriel Bowser has attempted to curb youth crime by invoking curfews for those under 18 years of age.\nHowever, the apparent lack of progress led Trump to threaten Tuesday to federalize DC if Bowser doesn\u2019t get crime under control.\n\u201cLocal \u2018youths\u2019 and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent Citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released,\u201d the president posted on Truth Social on Tuesday.\nTrump urged city officials to begin charging minors as adults for violent crimes beginning at age 14 \u2014 and \u201clock them up for a long time\u201d."

      "text": "DC crime is out of control \u2014 a federal takeover could be the only solution\nLast year, I first proposed to my husband the idea of allowing our preteen daughter to ride the Washington, DC, Metro alone. She wants to take Irish dance classes in the city, and a weekly drive in from the Maryland suburbs is too much for the family schedule.\nThen came story after story of stabbings, gang violence, and even a shooting on the Metro.\nMy proposal went back on the shelf.\nWe moved to the DC suburbs because of its proximity to the best our nation\u2019s capital has to offer. I frequently take our six kids into the city to explore the Smithsonian museums, attend performances at the Kennedy Center, and soak up the living civics lesson that is Washington, DC.\nBut in recent years, that promise has begun to unravel.\nThe Metro stations that once filled us with civic pride now fill us with unease. City streets feel less predictable, less policed.\nAnd worst of all, none of it feels like an accident.\nSince the pandemic and the 2020 protests, Washington, DC has been spiraling.\nPolice were demoralized. Prosecutions declined. Repeat offenders walked free.\nThe result? Growing lawlessness and a population that no longer feels protected.\nJust this week, a former DOGE employee risked his life to save a woman from being assaulted by a group of a dozen teens in the city. He was beaten so severely that he suffered a concussion, but he prevented what could have been a much more tragic outcome.\nElon Musk shared the story on X and added his own conclusion: \u201cIt is time to federalize DC.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not the only one who feels that way.\nPresident Donald Trump posted a blistering statement on Truth Social, declaring that \u201cCrime in Washington, DC is totally out of control.\u201d\nHe pointed to youth gangs, violent assaults and the lack of consequences for offenders.\n\u201cIf DC doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly,\u201d Trump warned, \u201cwe will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City . . . and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore.\u201d\nCritics will call this authoritarian.\nBut for parents like me, people trying to raise independent, confident children in this area, the idea is simply a relief.\nAnd this isn\u2019t just about families and tourists.\nLeo Terrell, chair of the Justice Department\u2019s task force to combat antisemitism, sent a letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser this week blasting the city\u2019s failure to protect the Israel on Campus Coalition\u2019s recent student conference.\nThe organizers had to spend over a quarter of a million dollars on private security to ensure the safety of Jewish attendees \u2014 what Terrell called a \u201cJewish tax\u201d just to exist peacefully in public.\nIn May, a House staffer was the victim of an armed carjacking in Navy Yard.\nIn July, a congressional intern, 21-year-old Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, was killed in a drive-by shooting that also injured a 16-year-old boy and a woman.\nIf we want the best and brightest to visit our city and serve in government as staffers, civil servants or interns, we need to offer them a capital that is safe to live in.\nRight now, we can\u2019t.\nIf staffers, students and commuters can\u2019t move through this city without fear, what exactly are we doing?\nI\u2019d love to hand my daughter a flip phone and a SmartTrip card and give her a taste of independence.\nBut I can\u2019t.\nNot while Metro attacks happen weekly.\nNot while carjackings plague every neighborhood.\nNot while city leaders stand paralyzed, caught between ideology and inertia.\nWashington, DC, should be a national showcase \u2014 but unless someone restores order, the city will continue its descent into fear and frustration.\nThe message from parents, federal workers and even tech billionaires is the same: Enough is enough.\nWe want our kids to love this city. But more than that, we want them to be safe in it.\nAnd that shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask.\nBethany Mandel writes and podcasts at The Mom Wars and is a homeschooling mother of six in greater Washington, DC."

      "text": "Ex-DOGE staffer nicknamed \u2018Big Balls\u2019 left bloodied after savage DC carjacking attempt by 10 juveniles\nA 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer was beaten and bloodied by a mob of 10 minors early Sunday as he thwarted a carjacking attempt in the nation\u2019s capital, according to DC police.\nEdward Coristine, whose LinkedIn handle earned him the nickname \u201cBig Balls\u201d at DOGE, was with a woman near downtown DC when he saw the group of juveniles approach their car and \u201cmake a comment about taking the vehicle,\u201d according to a Metropolitan Police Department incident report obtained by The Post.\n\u201cAt that point, for her safety, [Coristine] pushed his significant other \u2026 into the vehicle and turned to deal with the suspects,\u201d the dramatic report continues.\n\u201cThe suspects then began to assault [Coristine],\u201d the ex-DOGE staffer told officers, who rolled up on the scene at the same time he was being attacked.\nOfficers patrolling the 1400 block of Swann Street NW \u2014 a popular area with several shops, bars and restaurants about a mile north of the White House \u2014 noticed \u201ca group of approximately ten juveniles surrounding the complainants\u2019 vehicle and assaulting [Coristine],\u201d the report states.\n\u201cThe officers immediately exited their vehicle, and the juveniles began fleeing on foot,\u201d police said.\nDC police were able to nab only two of the young suspects, who were later positively identified by Coristine as being among his attackers.\nA 15-year-old male and a 15-year-old female, both from nearby Hyattsville, Md., were arrested and charged with unarmed carjacking.\nCoristine was treated on scene by DC Fire and EMS for injuries sustained in the assault, according to DC police.\nHe is recovering from a broken nose, concussion and black eye, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nThe group of teenagers \u201cshouted about taking the woman\u2019s car, and then ran across the street,\u201d just before they started to beat Coristine, a source said.\nCoristine then pushed his female companion into the driver\u2019s seat and slammed the door.\n\u201cThe gang tried to open the closed doors and slammed [Coristine] against the car extremely loudly while attacking him,\u201d the source added, noting that the woman called 911 from inside the vehicle while Coristine was being beaten.\nThe software whiz also had his iPhone 16, valued at $1,000, stolen during the attack.\nPresident Trump shared a photograph of the aftermath of the assault on Coristine early Tuesday afternoon, showing the former DOGE staffer sitting on the ground, bloodied and with his ripped shirt barely hanging on his body.\nTrump, 79, raged that \u201ccrime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control\u201d in the post, where he also threatened a federal takeover of the district.\nMarko Elez, a one-time colleague of Coristine\u2019s at DOGE, claimed in a social media post that he snapped the photo of his friend shortly after the assault, and described his actions as heroic.\n\u201cMy friend Big Balls \u2026 is a hero,\u201d Elez wrote on X. \u201cI took this photo after Edward protected a young woman from an attempted carjacking by 8 thugs near Dupont Circle.\u201d\n\u201cViolence like this in the heart of DC is completely unacceptable.\u201d\nFormer DOGE chief Elon Musk also posted about the incident on X, without naming Coristine as the victim.\nCoristine resigned from DOGE in June, according to Fox News, less than a month after Musk departed from the agency."

      "text": "President Donald Trump wants a new census.\nIf by this he means a snap-census before the scheduled 2030 survey, he\u2019s demanding that the federal government undertake a gargantuan task with minimal planning and no discernible source of funding.\nIn statistical terms, it\u2019d be like launching D-Day with a month\u2019s lead time.\nIf the White Queen believes six impossible things before breakfast, that the Census Bureau could pull this off would qualify as one of them.\nThe agency couldn\u2019t even competently conduct the last, regularly scheduled census in 2020.\nGiven that conducting the census is a core function of the federal government \u2014 indeed, mandated by the Constitution \u2014 it is outrageous that the last survey missed so badly.\nIt undercounted Florida and other red states (as well as Illinois) and overcounted New York and a number of blue states (plus, Ohio and Utah).\nBecause the apportionment of congressional seats depends on population as determined by the census, these were highly consequential errors that can\u2019t be allowed to happen again.\nThere\u2019s no legal mechanism for fixing it, though. We just have to do better in 2030.\nTrump is also, understandably, chagrined that illegal immigrants are included in the census and declares that, going forward, they \u201cWILL NOT BE COUNTED.\u201d\nHere he\u2019s going to run smack into the relevant legal texts.\nArticle I Section 2 of the Constitution refers to \u201cthe Whole Number of free Persons,\u201d while the 14th Amendment includes \u201cthe whole number of persons in each State.\u201d\nIn similar fashion, the US code calls for a \u201ctabulation of total population by States.\u201d\nSo it\u2019s hard to see how illegal immigrants can be excluded from the count.\nAs it happens, illegal migrants \u2014 who make up just a small proportion of America\u2019s total immigrant population \u2014 don\u2019t seem to have much of an effect on the partisan breakdown of congressional seats one way or the other.\nAlthough the highest numbers of them live in blue California, they are spread around the country, with large numbers in Texas and Florida as well.\nA change that Trump wanted in the 2020 census was the inclusion, once again, of a citizenship question \u2014 highly relevant information that it\u2019s entirely appropriate to ask.\nThere was a long period from the 19th century through 1950 when the census survey asked about citizenship. Later, it was relegated to the so-called \u201clong form.\u201d\nFinally the long form itself was axed after 2000 \u2014 and today it\u2019s considered a scandal to even think about reviving it.\nTrump\u2019s proposal to ask the question on the 2020 census encountered stiff resistance and the Supreme Court squashed it.\nBut in the big picture, non-citizens who are here legally do have a significant impact on congressional apportionment.\nRecent research by the Center for Immigration Studies found that all immigrants (naturalized citizens as well as all other immigrant categories) shifted 14 congressional seats to Democratic states on net in 2020.\nNon-citizens also distort the composition of congressional districts.\nThe CIS study found the same number of citizens in the 13 congressional districts with the highest share of non-citizens as in the nine districts with the lowest share of non-citizens.\nIn other words, the citizens in those nine low-immigration districts get four fewer representatives than did the citizens in the 13 high-immigration districts.\nIt\u2019s one man, one vote \u2014 with an asterisk.\nTo take an example from Texas, the Democratic-held 33rd district, where non-citizens are nearly 30% of the population, has 208,000 fewer voting-age citizens than the Texas 21st district.\nThat means the citizens of the 33rd district have marginally more clout and representation, thanks to a population tilted toward those who can\u2019t vote.\nUltimately, the way to diminish these effects is to reduce the level of immigration.\nEarly indications are showing a large exodus of illegal immigrants since Trump\u2019s election, and that the United States will have net negative migration this year for the first time in a half-century.\nIf Trump wants to fully capture the changes he\u2019s effecting in immigration policy, he should indeed want a new census \u2014 but let\u2019s wait until 2030.\nTwitter: @RichLowry"

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 while warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor \u2014 and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending his control, which would require a bare majority in the Republican-held House and Senate.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, the Senate-confirmed administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned about making sure that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8. Photos circulating on social media and in the press showed those agents wearing clearly identifying uniforms.\nMPD Chief Pamela Smith confirmed she had a meeting set for later Monday with two federal officials, whom she did not name, about next steps.\nSmith added she was interested in receiving help to enforce outstanding warrants for criminal suspects, saying there are \u201cthings that the federal government is also very useful for.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be an opportunity for us to come together and collaborate on being able to go out and execute warrants,\u201d the police chief said.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s announcement, Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday that \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nDC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton endorsed Trump\u2019s takeover, saying in a Fox News interview: \u201cWe completely agree with the president that crime in the District of Columbia is out of control and something needs to be done with it.\u201d\nNew York, Chicago, LA in crosshairs\nTrump announced at his press conference that other cities may be next, saying at one point that \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while\u201d \u2014 and also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting very strongly with DC, and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly as they say.\u201d\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"

The National Guard will be deployed to assist in patrolling the streets, and Trump has threatened similar actions in other cities like New York and Chicago if crime does not improve. Critics argue that this approach is heavy-handed, while supporters claim it is necessary to restore safety and order in the capital.",
