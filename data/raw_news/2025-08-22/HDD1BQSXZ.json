  "content": "Investing.com - H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Neutral rating on Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ) following the company\u2019s second-quarter 2025 financial results, which showed sequential revenue decline. According to InvestingPro data, the company\u2019s overall financial health score stands at 1.5, indicating a weak position, with revenue declining 11.36% over the last twelve months.\n\nMawson reported Q2 revenue of $9.5 million, down from $13.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to Consensus Technology Group\u2019s withdrawal of miners from the company\u2019s Midland, Pennsylvania facility in April, which negatively impacted co-location revenue. The company\u2019s market capitalization currently stands at $8.73 million, with a beta of 3.9 indicating high stock price volatility.\n\nThe company\u2019s energy management revenue increased to $5.1 million from $3.1 million in the previous quarter, while self-mining revenue rose to $0.7 million from $0.3 million, partially offsetting the co-location revenue decline.\n\nMawson\u2019s near-term recovery strategy centers on executing its 64MW, three-year co-location agreement with Canaan, which the research firm views as the most direct path to restoring contracted revenue, while the company\u2019s flagship 120MW Midland site remains approximately 70% utilized.\n\nThe appointment of a new interim CEO in June could help resolve legal issues more quickly, according to H.C. Wainwright, which remains on the sidelines until positive milestones in legal settlements clear existing overhangs.\n\nIn other recent news, Mawson Infrastructure Group announced the termination of Rahul Mewawalla as Chief Executive Officer and President, effective July 8. The company stated that the termination was for cause, as outlined in Mewawalla\u2019s employment agreement. Following his departure, Mewawalla was required to forfeit 4,548,512 unvested restricted stock units. Additionally, the board of directors requested that Mewawalla resign from his position on the board, which he was deemed to have done immediately. These developments mark a significant change in the company\u2019s leadership. The termination and subsequent legal actions are part of ongoing internal adjustments. The company did not provide further details on the reasons behind these decisions.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",
