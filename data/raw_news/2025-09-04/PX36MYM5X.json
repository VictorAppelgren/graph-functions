  "description": "The Ferrari-licensed steering wheel is available now",
  "content": "\u2022 The low cost of the Thrustmaster T98 is designed with children and entry-level players in mind, according to product marketing manager Xavier Pieuchot\n\u2022 Pieuchot says the T98 is \"everything you need to make your first step into a racing game\"\n\u2022 He also says the low cost meant Thrustmaster couldn't implement force feedback, but that it's more suitable for children\n\nThrustmaster's new, Ferrari-licensed T98 is a low-cost racing wheel designed for kids and wheel newcomers, but this meant the manufacturer couldn't add one key feature.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with TechRadar Gaming at Gamescom 2025, following the T98's announcement, Thrustmaster product marketing manager Xavier Pieuchot explained that the wheel's $100 / \u00a389.99 / \u20ac100 price tag allows first-time wheel users to get started cheaply, particularly children.\n\n\"It's not aimed at sim racers, it's aimed at kids, for first-time steering wheel users,\" Pieuchot said, \"but there is a big market here because all the guys now playing sim racing [games] with pro stuff should start with something cheap at the beginning, so that's why we have launched this one [the T98].\n\n\"Below \u20ac100, most of the time you get very cheap design, very cheap plastic as well. Here we bring [the] Ferrari license, so we can't say that it's a replica because it's not 1:1 scale. But it's very inspired by the GTB.\n\n\"Basically, you have a kind of replica, good-looking steering wheel and everything you need to make your first step into a racing game.\"\n\nHowever, because of T98's low cost, this meant the company couldn't afford to implement force feedback, a common component found in many of the best racing wheels that uses an electric motor to generate realistic resistance.\n\nPieuchot explained that since it's a more budget-friendly product, it couldn't offer the same experience as a wheel with force feedback power, adding that it would be more suitable for small children anyway.\n\n\"You have a product which looks like a steering wheel, so you have a better immersion of driving a car, but we know that at the end it's not the way you start and get serious with sim racing, so that's why,\" he said. \"And, as I said, [the] motor is the most expensive part of the steering wheel.\n\n\"So if we want to achieve the below \u20ac100 target, we just can't afford the feedback,\" he said. \"It's way easier and safer for a family to put a steering wheel like this in a kids' hands.\"\n\nThe Thrustmaster T98 is available now and is compatible with PC, PS4, and PS5.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Best PC racing wheels in 2025: bolster your desktop with a dedicated racing sim setup\n\u2022 007 First Light won't have the same logic as the Bond movies, says dev \u2013 'We really were inspired by some of these classic tropes, and then we adapted them to fit the modern medium'\n\u2022 IOI is planning on adding a wide variety of accessibility options to 007 First Light, says dev \u2013 'It is super, super important for us'",

So the same logic doesn't necessarily apply. Obviously, I'm not saying here that we weren't critical of ourselves and that we didn't finesse ideas to feel great. What I'm saying is the same logic does not apply to games.\"\nPoulsen continued, saying that the team attempted to recreate similar color grading that the older Bond movies are known for, but it didn't look right for the action game.\n\"Another aspect is, for instance, we were exploring color selection and color grading, and so for the car chase [in the demo] and the whole mission in general, we were inspired by color palettes of old movies, and at the same time, the treatment of that... they look sort of compressed and a little gray and a little faded.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nAn excellent all-round console with a fantastic catalog of AAA games, the slimmed down PS4 is better in almost every way compared to the original \u2013 barring one notable exception.\nPros\n- +\nGreat games\n- +\nGood value\n- +\nImproved power efficiency\n- +\nPS Plus still a great deal\n- +\nDualShock 4 better than ever\nCons\n- -\nOptical audio removed\n- -\nNo 4K Blu-ray player\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe PS4 Slim offers the same insides as the original PS4 but benefits from a sleeker design that also conveniently shaves off a few figures from the price tag. It\u2019s a fantastic console, even compared to the PS4 Pro and the next-gen PS5, so even though it may be starting to show its age, it doesn\u2019t stutter for a moment.\nMany models of the PS4 have been discontinued since the PS5 was released, but the PS4 Slim is still one of the remaining being stocked, and Sony intends to keep production going for as long as possible. So, you can find some reasonably priced PS4 bundles in any upcoming sales. But, if you\u2019re looking for something to support 4K gaming, then the PS5 is more than likely up your alley.\nThe PS4 Slim is also the most affordable option for PS4 home consoles, but there are certain compromises because of this. There\u2019s no 4K resolution and no optical audio output, but you can work with these limitations, so the PS4 Slim offers a lot of bang for your buck. The compact size also means the console is quieter and uses less power.\nWith all this in mind, is the PlayStation 4 Slim still a console that\u2019s worth picking up or would those looking to game with Sony be better opting for a PS5? That console does offer a massive jump in power over the PS4 and, though there are shortages, it's going to be easier to find than the now discontinued mid-gen upgrade PS4 Pro.\nOverall, the PS5 is the smart option to save for if you really want to future-proof for the next few years of PlayStation games. Yes, plenty of the latest releases are being released across the generations, so if you pick up a PS4 you won\u2019t immediately be left behind.\nHowever, you might find that some new games aren\u2019t quite up to scratch on the older hardware. Plus, the PS5 is backwards compatible with the best PS4 games, so you won't miss out on the back catalogue. if you're truly looking to weigh up the best option for you, we've got you covered in our head-to-head guide: PS5 vs PS4: should you buy a PlayStation 5 in 2022?\nIf, however, you aren\u2019t all that interested in the latest hardware with its 4K bells and whistles and you just want a machine that\u2019ll help you catch up with the PS4\u2019s fantastic library of games, then the PS4 Slim is an option that might just suit you. Read on for more detailed thoughts on the console.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSony PS4 (Slim): quick questions answered\nWhat's the difference between the PS4 Slim and the PS4 Pro? The PS4 Slim is essentially a slimmer, cheaper and better-looking version of the original PS4. In contrast, the PS4 Pro is more premium and can play games in 4K\nIf you want to dig deeper into the differences between the two PS4 consoles, then check out our head-to-head guide: PS4 Pro vs PS4: what's the difference? Do be aware, though, that the PS4 Pro is no longer widely available.\nIs the PS4 Slim better than the PS4 Pro? When it comes to specs, no. It's the PS4 Pro that's the superior console. It offers you 'true' 4K gaming, which is difficult to get on other devices without compromising. It's also bulkier on the outside and on the inside, the GPU is a great deal faster. Although the CPU is architecturally similar, it's been clocked at a faster speed.\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean you should buy one. The PS4 Pro is better for those who want a premium gaming experience and have a 4K TV. If you don't have a 4K TV or money to spare, the PS4 Slim might be better for you.\nIs the PS4 Slim 4K? No it's not. You won't get 4K with the PS4 Slim, so if you're interested in 4K gaming and a 4K Blu-ray player, you'll need to set your sights on the PS4 Pro or PS5 instead.\nPS4 Slim: design\nCast your mind back to when the original PlayStation 4 hit the scene, and you may remember that its unconventional shape drew quite a bit of attention when it was first revealed. The slimmed down PS4 that debuted in 2016 more-or-less retained the core visual identity of the first PlayStation 4, but made the parallelogram package even more compact, smoothing off some of the edges.\nThe first PlayStation 4 measured 27.5 x 30 x 5.3 cm, whereas the latest PS4 Slim cuts that down to 26.5 x 26.5 x 3.8 cm, roughly a third smaller. The overall weight is comparably lighter too.\nThe first PS4 mixed shiny and matte plastics, but the PS4 Slim extends the matte black finish all over the console. The top-mounted colored light bar indicator \u2013 showing sleep, wake and off statuses \u2013 gets dropped in favor of small illuminated dots over the power button (which are actually harder to see, so take care before unplugging the unit).\nAs before, the disk drive slot is a front-facing affair, above small power and eject buttons. More recent revisions of the PS4 also featured physical buttons on the console, but the launch edition PS4 favored touch-sensitive controls instead. Two USB ports sit on the front of the PlayStation 4 Slim, as was the case on earlier PS4 models, but they're now much further apart and slightly easier to plug into.\nBoth 500GB and 1TB versions of the PS4 Slim are available, though the former is much rarer. If you opt for the smaller of the two you might find your hard drive fills up surprisingly quickly with the console's reliance on mandatory game installs, but thankfully it's fairly easy to upgrade the internal hard drive or install games to an external hard drive.\nAround the back is the power plug socket (no need for an external power brick), a HDMI port, the PlayStation Camera's expansion port (essential for the PlayStation VR) and an Ethernet network jack socket.\nThe only major casualty of the slimmed-down design is the Optical Out port on the rear: HDMI will suit the needs of many gamers for carrying audio signals, but the Optical Out port will be missed by those hooking up older home cinema receivers, or souped-up gaming headsets.\nThe PS4 Slim has plenty of nice design touches dotted around its chassis though. The iconic Square, Triangle, Circle and Cross symbols of the PlayStation brand are stamped into the side of the console (with the Circle acting as a fixture for those wishing to stand the console upright with a base accessory).\nThe same symbols are found stuck to the bottom too, acting as feet to raise the machine off a surface for improved airflow. All in, it's a well-considered design, markedly justifying its \"Slim\" street name.\nPS4 Slim: setup\nSetting up the slim PlayStation 4 is very easy \u2013 especially if you're upgrading from the original PS4 (or even a PS3), because you can use all the same cables, so no need to stretch behind your TV.\nSimply plug in the included HDMI and power cables and connect to the internet to download the console's various patches and updates. Alternatively, you're able to skip Wi-Fi or Ethernet altogether and just pop in a game. Unlike the Xbox One, you can get to the homescreen without initially connecting to the web and patching first.\nOnce you do connect to the internet, you'll need to let the PS4 update before you can make purchases from the store or play online.\nPS4 Slim: media\nSince the very first PlayStation, Sony's home consoles have led the charge when it comes to media playback support. The PS One made for a great CD player, the PS2 was many gamers' first DVD player, and the PS3 introduced a Blu-ray deck and USB playback.\nThe PS4, while not introducing a new format of its own, picked up the baton passed by the PS3, offering wide-ranging streaming service support, Blu-ray and DVD playback, USB media functionality and even banging out the tunes with its own Spotify player. That's been carried over to the PS4 Slim.\nWhat the PS4 Slim doesn't do, however, is offer an answer to the Xbox One S's 4K Blu-ray player, instead sticking with the original PS4's standard full HD Blu-ray player. It's still a strong deck, but anyone looking to show off their 4K TVs with the PS4 Slim will be disappointed (and it's notably absent from the PS4 Pro too).\nYou could argue that with streaming increasingly used to watch media content, it's not a desperately needed feature, especially if it keeps the overall cost down. But it will age the PS4 Slim console, preventing it from being fully future-proofed. What's perhaps more annoying is the complete removal of the optical out audio socket, which could cause headaches for those with older AV equipment.\nHowever, one upgrade that applies to the entire range of PS4s, the PS4 Slim included, is HDR support. This adds greater detail to light sources in an image, and is pretty much a staple in TV tech these days.\nAll the other streaming services and apps featured on the PS4 return for the PS4 Slim, including (but not limited to) Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, as well as BBC iPlayer and TV from Sky in the UK, and HBO Go and Hulu in the US.\nSony's own movie rental platform is available too if you're looking for the latest Hollywood releases. YouTube is here, as is Twitch game streaming, and a Spotify Connect-enabled version of the popular music streaming service, letting you control tunes on your telly from the comfort of your phone.\nGerald is Editor-in-Chief of iMore.com.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe PS5 is a powerful console offering a sublime current-gen gaming experience. Its library of exclusive games makes fantastic use of the DualSense controller, 3D Audio, and the console's lightning-fast SSD. It might be too big for some setups, though, and a handful of issues hold it back from perfection.\nPros\n- +\n4K/120fps gameplay\n- +\nRevolutionary controller haptics\n- +\nBeautiful, fast UI\n- +\nLightning-fast SSD\nCons\n- -\nMassive size\n- -\n825GB SSD fills up quick\n- -\nNo Dolby Vision\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nPS5 two-minute review\nThe PS5 had some pretty high expectations to match following the success of the PS4, but it's safe to say Sony's current-gen console has massively exceeded every standard set by its predecessor. There's a huge amount to talk about when showcasing what makes the console so impressive, including everything that comes alongside the console itself.\nThe DualSense controller is nothing short of a revelation with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. It's a phenomenally clever bit of tech that, in itself, is a selling point for the console. Sony has also since released an upgraded version, named the DualSense Edge, which would've been equally as impressive as its counterpart if not for the eye-watering price.\nWith the combination of a fresh UI, rapid SSD-fuelled load times, immersive 3D audio, and incredibly powerful hardware, the PS5 takes some generational strides over the PS4. For these reasons and more, once you've started playing the PS5, it's hard to stop.\nBut there's no avoiding that the console itself is an eyesore, largely due to its wing-like faceplates and bulky size - although the size has been addressed somewhat with the updated model unofficially known as the PS5 Slim. The plus side to this is that the original PS5's gargantuan size ensures that it's quiet and runs suitably cool. You can still place the console vertically or horizontally, though we really wish it didn't need a stand when on its side. More importantly, we haven't experienced any major hardware issues since launch, like hard crashes or storage corruption.\nOne area where the PS5 has been slow on the uptake is support for the best 120Hz TVs with HDMI 2.1. However, the games that support 120fps is steadily growing, including first and third-party hits like Horizon Forbidden West, Fortnite and Ghostwire Tokyo.\nEqually fantastic is the addition of VRR support to PS5. VRR (or variable refresh rate) keeps the action running smooth on compatible TVs. With PS5 VRR enabled, the console is able to maintain high framerates, without screen tearing, and with little to no hits to overall performance. It's an awesome feature we're very happy to see on PS5.\nHowever, you won't need a top-shelf TV to feel the benefits of the PS5\u2019s substantial horsepower. You can still enjoy unbelievably fast load times, significantly better performance, and a greater level of visual fidelity in new and older games alike.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFrom a simpler setup to a well-thought-out user interface, Sony has also re-imagined the key parts of the user experience with some pleasing extras to boot: PS Plus Essential members can enjoy a curated selection of games straight away, while Plus Extra and Premium can access an additional Game Catalog and Classics Catalog. Backward compatibility also ensures that your old collection of the best PS4 games works on day one.\nThe end result is a console that we're impressed with, which is ultimately strengthened by the PlayStation 5's compelling line-up of exclusive games that continues to grow.\nWe'd love to have seen more first-party games at launch (there were only four if you include pack-in game Astro's Playroom). It would also have been wonderful to see further support for previous generations of PlayStation titles, like PS2 and PS3. Still, the PlayStation 5 feels like a solid investment and with a growing library of the best PS5 games, we're confident this experience will only improve with age.\nThe library of compelling titles has certainly grown since the PS5\u2019s release. Returnal takes full advantage of the console\u2019s feature set, Horizon Forbidden West and Gran Turismo 7 both look stunning on the new-gen hardware, while Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a visual spectacle that needs to be seen to be believed.\nThe original, launch-model, of the PS5 - which our review here considers - has now been fully and officially usurped by the PS5 Slim. As of 2025, you can barely find the original model for sale anymore.\nThis smaller model launched in November 2023 at the same price, but upped the internal storage a little, and swapped one USB-A port for another USB-C port. It still offers the same excellent performance, and you can also swap out the console covers easily, whether you have the disc or digital edition. Read more in our full PS5 Slim review.\nThe PS5 caters to people ready to jump into the new generation of video games, alongside PS4 owners who don\u2019t want to leave their collection of games behind. It's a console that seamlessly bridges the gap between the last generation and the new, so you probably won't need to boot up your PS4 ever again.\nThere's big upgrades like the super-fast NVMe SSD and powerful GPU that enable higher frame rates and ray tracing. But you'll also appreciate the subtle touches like the built-in microphone on the controller that can serve as a quick stand-in for a headset. The PS5 feels like it was built for ease of use as well as pure power.\nThe PS5 Digital Edition is exactly the same as the standard PS5 but removes the 4K Blu-Ray drive to offer a cheaper price point at $399 / \u00a3389.99 / AU$649.95 and a more symmetrical look. We've pitted the two PS5 consoles against each other in this PS5 vs PS5 Digital Edition comparison, so you can determine which one is right for you.\nWhichever PS5 model you choose, though, we can wholeheartedly recommend the console as a welcome upgrade over the PS4, and an exciting portal to new-gen gameplay. Read on for our full PS5 review.\nWatch our PS5 video review below:\nPS5 review: price and release date\n- PS5 release date: Out now (released on November 12/19, 2020)\n- PS5 price: $499.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$799.95\n- PS5 Digital Edition price: $399.99 / \u00a3389.99 / AU$649.95\nThe PS5 was released in North America, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand on November 12, 2020. It came two days after the release of Microsoft\u2019s new-gen consoles, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. For the rest of the world, the console became available one week later on November 19.\nFor the PS5\u2019s price, it originally cost $499.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$749.95 for the standard version of the console with a 4K Blu-ray disc drive. However, if that\u2019s more than you want to spend, there\u2019s also the PS5 Digital Edition, which is exactly the same apart from the fact it removes the disc drive entirely. At launch, that cost $399.99 / \u00a3359.99 / AU$599.95, which is a saving of $100 / \u00a390 / AU$150 over the standard model.\nThe PS5 is more expensive than the launch price of the PS4, PS4 Slim, and PS4 Pro, which both came in at $399.99, but they arrived seven and four years ago respectively now, and you're getting a generational leap in hardware here for $100 more. The PS5 is still expensive, don't get us wrong, but the jump in price does feel warranted for what you\u2019re getting.\nHowever, much like the Oculus Quest 2, we've seen the PS5 get a price hike with Sony blaming this on soaring inflation globally. The US remains unaffected but that's gone up to \u00a3479.99 / \u20ac549.99 / AU$799.95 for the standard PS5, and \u00a3389.99 / \u20ac449.99 / $649.95 for the digital PS5.\nSony isn't the only console maker with new hardware on the block, though \u2013 you also have to consider the Xbox Series X/S, which is the closest competitor to Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5. Priced at $499 / \u00a3479 / $AU749 and $299 /\u00a3249 / $AU499 respectively, this makes PS5 generally more expensive than Microsoft's latest consoles.\nWe\u2019ve delivered our verdict in their respective reviews linked above, so we won't spend much time talking about them here. But if you\u2019re interested in how these two compare, be sure to check out our PS5 vs Xbox Series X breakdown for more details.\nPS5 review: design\n- Huge for a modern gaming console\n- Space-age aesthetic is polarizing\n- But the size means more space for air ventilation and a bigger fan\nIf gaming consoles had weight classes, the PS5 would be in the heavyweight division. We measured the original to be around 39 x 10.4 x 26cm (H x W x D) \u2013 though the curved surfaces make getting an exact measurement difficult. The original PS5 isn\u2019t light, either. It weighs in at 4.5kg, giving it a noticeable heft when you pick it up.\nWith those measurements in mind, it's easy to see how the PlayStation 5 is the largest console Sony has ever made, and it teeters on the brink of being simply too big for a device that's supposed to sit under your TV. Many will have to rethink their current setup to accommodate Sony's new machine, and that's a problem that no one should have to worry about when picking up a new console.\nAs for the colors and shape of the console, well, they can be kind of polarizing, too. Some of us on the team absolutely love the PS5 design, while some of us hate the PS5 design. There's no denying, however, that its gargantuan size and two-tone color scheme demands attention in any home. Thankfully, since launch Sony has allowed us to buy new PS5 console covers, each coming in different colors.\nOne element that's a delightful touch, and universally liked by the TechRadar team, is the system's subtle lighting effect, which creates a soothing hue when the console is in operation or rest mode.\nThe light strip adds to the PS5's space-age look and feel, and represents a nice touch of continuity from the PS4. Much like the PlayStation 4, when the console is in rest mode the light turns orange, and when the PS5 is turned on it changes from blue to white.\nWe\u2019re a bit bemused by Sony's choice to put glossy plastic down the center spine of the console, though, particularly as that's where the front USB ports are located. After over three years of use, we can confirm that the plastic can become scratched over time, even though we were extremely careful when plugging in any devices into the front of the console.\nWe were worried that this might be the case when we first reviewed the PS5, and we\u2019re kind of surprised that Sony didn\u2019t contemplate this happening during development. The glossy finish is also a big dust and fingerprint magnet, which makes the choice all the more bewildering. Thankfully, it's relatively easy to clean your PS5.\nDue to its curves and tall stature, it's not just a case of placing the console down and playing once you pull the PS5 out the box. You'll need to wrap your head around the PS5's attachable stand first, which isn\u2019t exactly the most user-friendly experience.\nThe console can't be placed horizontally without the PS5\u2019s stand, and you risk impeding airflow if you don't use it when the PS5 is standing vertically.\nThe stand, while functional, feels slightly cheap in the hand too. It has a small compartment to hold one lone screw (don\u2019t lose this, as you'll need it when placing the console vertically) and at first glance, it doesn't look like the setup will actually work when laying the console flat.\nTo its credit, though, it does the job in a no-thrills fashion \u2013 however, we found the stand slipped off the small lip that it clamps onto multiple times when we shifted our unit into position.\nIn terms of ports, the front of the PlayStation 5 has a USB-A and USB-C port, while the back sports two USB-A ports, a HDMI 2.1 port, an Ethernet port and a power port. There are no proprietary ports on the console, which is always a bonus if you need to replace the odd cable.\nPS5 review: performance\n- Capable of 4K/120fps gameplay as well as support for 8K/60\n- Faster loading times thanks to new SSD\n- System runs cool and quiet nearly all the time\nWhen it comes to specs, the PS5 is a technically impressive piece of hardware. There's the new custom RDNA 2 GPU that can push 4K resolution at 120 frames per second, and the octa-core AMD Zen 2-based CPU with a 3.5GHz clock speed.\nThrow in 16GB of GDDR6 memory and a 825GB NVMe SSD, and this is a machine with some seriously impressive specs. The PS5 is also capable of outputting 8K resolution, however, we'll need to wait for a firmware update from Sony before it's able to do so.\nCPU: AMD Zen 2-based CPU with 8 cores at 3.5GHz (variable frequency)\nGPU: 10.28 TFLOPs, 36 CUs at 2.23GHz (variable frequency)\nGPU architecture: Custom RDNA 2\nMemory interface: 16GB GDDR6 / 256-bit\nMemory bandwidth: 448GB/s\nInternal storage: Custom 825GB SSD\nUsable storage: 667.2GB\nIO throughput: 5.5GB/s (raw), typical 8-9GB/s (compressed)\nExpandable storage: NVMe SSD slot\nExternal storage: USB HDD support (PS4 games only)\nOptical drive: 4K UHD Blu-ray drive\nIn fact, the only real issue we have with the PlayStation 5's spec sheet is the amount of storage available. It's only using an 825GB SSD instead of, say, a 1TB or 2TB SSD. That decision was clearly made to cut down on the cost of the console, but it means that you can run out of storage quickly if you're not being judicious about which games you keep installed.\nThe console comes with 667.2GB of usable storage, which we found held around 16 games: two PS5 titles, which were Astro's Playroom and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and various PS4 games like God of War and Detroit: Beyond Human. The available space actually went further than we thought, although your mileage will vary depending on the size of the games you have installed.\nIt may have taken over eight months after launch, but it's now possible to upgrade the internal storage with an NVMe SSD. You can pop off the PS5's plastic faceplates to reveal the empty SSD bay and secure a compatible M.2 SSD in place using a screwdriver. We've rounded up the best SSD for PS5 and created a detailed guide showing you how to upgrade your PS5 internal SSD storage.\nAdding more storage via the SSD bay isn't the most intuitive of methods, and feels like a slight oversight on Sony's part - but hopefully, it's only something you'll need to do once. It\u2019s also handy that you'll at least be adding storage onto the existing 667GB, instead of starting from scratch.\nThe good news is that you're also able to use external hard drives and SSDs by plugging them into the USB port. You won't experience the same lightning-fast load times that you get from the built-in SSD and optional (not to mention locked) SSD bay. But if you use an external SSD, you'll still see a massive boost to load time performance over a regular mechanical hard drive.\nWe plugged in an external SSD into one of the PS5's USB ports and the process of getting things set up was effortless. The console detected that an external drive had been connected, and once it was formatted, we were able to store and transfer PS4 games to it. After a PS5 system update in April 2021, you can now also store PS5 games or save data to external storage. However, you\u2019ll need to transfer games back onto the internal drive if you wish to play them.\nWhile few of the launch games really gave the new hardware a run for its money, we can already see the potential in Sony's upgraded hardware. Crucially, more titles designed with PS5 specifically in mind are on the way.\nLoad times are where most new PS5 users will see a stark difference, to begin with. In Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, for example, load times have gone from 15-20 seconds on the PS4 to less than a second on the PS5, and Demon\u2019s Souls takes literally seconds to load entire, sprawling levels. Returnal is another game that benefits greatly from the PS5\u2019s super-fast SSD, with not a load screen in sight as you traverse countless biomes.\nGraphical improvements, particularly when it comes to resolution, are the next immediate highlights when it comes to playing on PS5. Astro's Playroom runs at a rock-solid 60 frames per second at a 4K resolution, and almost every title we\u2019ve played is either playable at 60fps by default or provides a 30fps mode with more visual flourishes. It's a dramatic and pleasing shift from the PS4, where games were often 1080p / 30fps.\nIn the future, more titles will run 4K resolutions at 120 frames per second, too, and there's the potential that less graphically intensive games could reach 8K/60fps. For now, though, we don't expect many games to hit that ambitious target (most will drop the resolution from 4K to achieve a higher frame rate), but there's a chance some titles will be able to achieve that coveted 4K/120fps output down the line.\nA small slice of the PS5 launch library supported 120fps, and included Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Devil May Cry V: Special Edition, Dirt 5, Rainbow Six Siege and WRC 9. It's worth noting that you'll need a HDMI 2.1-compliant TV to display the 120Hz refresh rate at higher than 1080p resolution. Here's how to enable 120Hz on PS5.\nUnfortunately, we haven\u2019t seen as many 120fps enabled games as we\u2019d hoped since the PS5 launched. Still, things are slowly improving, though you'll find far more 120fps games on Xbox Series X|S.\nSo what can you expect if you pick up a PS5 today? For now at least, most games will be capable of delivering 4K resolution at 30fps or 60fps when using a game's Performance Mode (which we'll explain below). Many will also utilize 4K image assets for crisper textures, while HDR support helps to provide better colors and contrast.\nCombine that with ray tracing and improved particle effects that are now possible with the current suite of development tools. Games look leaps and bounds better now than they did a decade ago.\nEven though not every PS5 launch game will have it, most should feature the aforementioned Performance Mode, which prioritizes higher frame rates over resolution and extra graphical features. With many games, this sacrifices various graphically-intensive effects like ray tracing or higher shadow quality, and drops the base resolution, in order to achieve higher frame rates like 60fps instead of 30fps.\nBut why would you want the extra frames at the expense of resolution? Well, higher frame rates make games feel far more responsive \u2013 which is a must for first-person shooters that require twitch-based reflexes and split-second decisions.\nFor some gamers, higher frame rates are the holy grail for consoles \u2013 something that has been hard to achieve for decades due to weaker hardware. To have this finally be an obtainable goal feels like a monumental achievement, even if it comes at the cost of some graphical flourishes.\nIf you'd prefer not to use Performance Mode, you can always choose Resolution Mode. This prioritizes higher resolutions, better rendering techniques like ray tracing, and more detailed graphics. We got a taste of that with Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and we loved what we saw. Lighting was improved substantially: windows glistened in the sunlight and contained realistic reflections, and the particle effects looked stunning.\nWhat you can expect from this new generation of gaming, then, is faster load times, better framerates in Performance Mode, and higher target resolutions everywhere else. Simply choose which option you prefer.\nHow good is PS5's 3D Tempest Audio?\nIf you head into the PS5 settings, you can adjust the 3D audio to suit your preference. There are five levels of height to choose from, so select the option that sounds closest to your ear level. Remember that 3D audio works on any headset, either wirelessly or when plugged into the DualSense controller, and can also be enabled using your TV speakers.\nThe PS5's 3D Tempest Audio is Sony's take on Dolby Atmos, or spatial audio in general. It works on any headset, with 3D audio support for TV speakers now available thanks to a recent update.\nWe've tested various spatial audio solutions in the past, ranging from Windows Sonic to Dolby Atmos, and we've found that PS5's 3D Audio is a comparable experience overall, though it isn\u2019t quite the revelation we hoped it might be.\nWe enjoyed hearing ships fly past and over our head in Astro's Playroom, and appreciated being able to pick out thugs that were closing in on us in Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. It's not as detailed or as realistic as Sony made out, though, at least not at this stage, and it will be up to developers to get the most out of the technology as it matures.\nReturnal has shown that 3D audio can be a powerful tool when it comes to increasing immersion and that it can also be beneficial in fast-paced games where audio cues are just as important as what you see on screen.\nIt\u2019s the best implementation of the technology yet, and we hope Sony continues to support it. Right now, these are the best PS5 headsets for 3D audio. You can expect to experience Tempest 3D audio in all of Sony's first-party titles, like Sackboy: A Big Adventure.\nWhat about heat and noise?\nThe PS5's monstrous footprint gives it one significant advantage over its predecessor in that the console is basically silent \u2013 and heat production is also minimal. We have noticed a bit of coil whine on some units, which is where the console emits a faint electrical noise during certain games, but compared to PS4 it\u2019s a monumental improvement.\nThe PS4 and PS4 Pro were renowned for their ability to kick up the system fans to obnoxious levels and output lots of heat, particularly on the earlier models, so those looking to pick up a PS5 will be relieved to hear that those problems have been eradicated.\nWe held our hand near the system during a long play session, and although the PlayStation 5 was clearly outputting hot air (as it's designed to do) it was emitting far less than what the PS4 Pro would push out.\nVery rarely in our testing did the fans reach an audibly loud level to the degree that the PS4 Pro did when running games like Horizon: Zero Dawn or God of War. However, that could simply be due to the fact that at the time of testing, we hadn't seen any resource-heavy PS5 games yet. Sony has also promised that it plans to optimize the PS5's fans using over-the-air updates, so the machine could get louder, or indeed quieter, when playing certain games later down the line.\nPS5 review: DualSense controller\n- New DualSense Controller feels like a revolution over the DualShock 4\n- Highlights are the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback\n- Mute button can mute your mic or, if your TV has HDMI CEC, your TV\nTo navigate this brave new world of console gaming, you'll need a new gamepad \u2013 namely, the new Sony DualSense controller.\nYou'll be pleased to hear that you get a DualSense controller in the box with your PS5, and the DualSense feels oddly similar in the hand to the DualShock 4 that shipped with the PS4. We found it to be incredibly comfortable to hold for extended periods, and were shocked that when we went back to our trusty DualShock 4, it felt plain wrong to hold after using the DualSense.\nPicking it up for the first time, the DualSense is fairly weighty and balanced, with most of the heft resting in the grips of the controller. While the majority of the controller features a matte white plastic finish, the bottoms of the grips themselves have a slightly rougher texture that actually makes the controller easier to hold, and less likely to slip out of your hands.\nIn fact, if you look closely, the texture is made up of tiny PlayStation face buttons, which is a neat little touch. The two-tone PS5 controller color scheme extends to the four face buttons, which still consist of the classic Triangle, Circle, Square and Cross (or X); however these are now devoid of color, and remind us of the PS Vita's minimalist approach.\nThere's a pop of color around the side of the central touchpad, though, as the PS4 Lightbar has thankfully been moved from the top of the gamepad to a less problematic position \u2013 thanks to its new placement, you won't now see an annoying glow reflecting off your TV.\nWhere early PlayStation controllers sported a convex analog design, the PS5 DualSense controller has concave control sticks, just like the DualShock 4, and they feel noticeably more durable this time around, with a pleasing textured finish on the outer ridge.\nOn early models of the PS4 the rubber analog sticks would sometimes wear away under vigorous gameplay sessions, and we\u2019re pleased to report that even after six months of use, we haven't seen it reoccur with the DualSense. You'll notice a few new buttons you haven't seen before on Sony's new pad, too \u2013 like the mute button that turns off the microphone that\u2019s built into the controller.\nWhen this is held down, it can mute your television speakers or headset, which we found to be a useful quality-of-life feature. When speaking into the mic, we found it worked best when we kept the controller in our usual playing position, instead of holding it towards our mouth. We wouldn\u2019t recommend using the DualSense microphone for voice chat, though \u2013 it isn\u2019t the highest quality and has a tendency to pick up a lot of environmental sounds.\nThe highlights of the new DualSense controller, however, are the adaptive trigger buttons that allow developers to add resistance to certain in-game actions. The adaptive triggers can use resistance to create various sensations that mimic real-life actions, like pushing down on the pedal of a car or pulling back a bow string.\nIt's a huge step forward for haptics in Sony's hardware, and we found that the haptic feedback itself is a vastly superior replacement for the traditional rumble of old. When a character runs across a certain surface, like metal, it manages somehow to replicate that feeling in the palms of your hands \u2013 it's a truly wonderful sensation.\nSo far, we've seen a variation of haptic feedback support integrated into every PS5 game we've played so far, and hope to see it supported by more games in the future; we expect the feature to shine most in first-party titles, though. Returnal uses the DualSense to great effect, mimicking the effect of rainfall using haptic feedback, and the trigger performing two fire types by pressing it either halfway or all the way down.\nAccessibility shouldn't be a concern either, as the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback can be turned off at system level, or adjusted to suit your needs. You can learn how to turn off the DualSense adaptive triggers and haptic feedback here. You can also use a PS5 DualSense controller on PC.\nBattery life, so far, has been a massive improvement over the DualShock 4. We played through a handful of PS5 and PS4 titles during our testing, including Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Astro's Playroom, and the controller eventually ran out of charge after 12 hours and 30 minutes. This will obviously vary depending on the types of games you\u2019re playing and how much they use the DualSense\u2019s features, of course, so that 12 hour figure could end up a lot lower.\nStill, it's an impressive feat when you consider the DualShock 4 lasted around five to eight hours at a stretch. While internal batteries can degrade over time, it's a strong start for Sony's new pad, particularly when you consider how much technology is packed into it. Of course, you can also use the controller wired if you prefer.\nTo charge the DualSense, you have two options: either connect it to the PlayStation 5 itself with the USB-C to USB-A cable that comes inside the box, or shell out for the optional PS5 DualSense Charging Station, which can charge two controllers at a time using the metal conduits on the bottom of the pad near the 3.5mm audio jack.\nYou can also charge the controller, or your USB headset, via the rear USB ports, or opt to use a USB-C to USB-C cable when using the front USB-C port to charge the DualSense controller.\nEither option works well, but the Charging Station does certainly look nicer sitting on the shelf, and more cost-effective third-party charging stations will likely become available in the coming months. We'll also need to test whether charging the controller via a USB-C to USB-C cable is quicker than using the USB-C to USB-A cable that comes with the console.\nStill, if that doesn't sound entirely appealing, there's always the recently announced DualSense Edge, Sony's rival to the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller and the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2. Presenting a more premium build with customizable options and bespoke features, we don't have a release date just yet for this, but we'll keep this updated once we know more.\nPS5 review: features\n- Redesigned user interface with beautiful splash screens for every game\n- PlayStation button has all new features\n- Party chat allows you to screen share\nDesign is one thing, but what can really elevate a console to the next level is its feature set \u2013 and thankfully the PS5 delivers here.\nThe PS5 innovates on what Sony's consoles have done in the past and, as a result, it might take a minute or two to get used to some of the new controls \u2013 pressing and holding the PlayStation button on the controller no longer brings up the quick menu, for example, but instead brings up a new Control Center.\nThis operates in much the same way as the quick menu did, and lets you view various sub-menus such as your Friends list, downloads in progress, notifications and, if you have your account linked, Spotify.\nOne of the more prominent new features is the PS5's Cards, with the most impactful being Activity Cards. Cards have various functions, allowing you to track trophy progress, jump into specific parts of a game like a challenge or multiplayer mode, see how far along you are on a game level, or simply see news from a developer. You can even watch a livestream of your friend\u2019s gameplay using a picture-in-picture mode, which is pretty cool.\nCards are also present as you delve further into a game\u2019s information, which is now displayed beautifully on the home screen.\nBy pressing down on the D-pad or flicking down on the analog stick, you can see the available Cards at a glance, circumventing the need to visit a game's main menu or particular mode to find out what's going on. They should prove useful for gamers of a lesser ability, too, as they can contain in-game hint videos in supported titles that help you overcome specific challenges or find that one last collectible.\nSince launch, we've already seen Sony retiring this PS5 launch feature, Accolades. Designed as a community awards feature to lets players commend fellow gamers for their assistance, Sony revealed that it hasn't received much use as anticipated, so it's now been dropped.\nOverall, we found Cards to be a useful addition, though horizontally scrolling through each one did feel cumbersome at times.\nThere's also a slight delay before they appear, which is at odds with the speed of the system as a whole. But, while not essential by any means, they help to add another layer of next-gen gloss to PlayStation 5 experience that you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nOutside of the interface, you can expect the return of groups and other social-based features from the PS4, like SharePlay, as well as easy video sharing. You'll be able to jump straight into the game your friends are playing from the menu, or invite them to larger groups. Video sharing on the PS5 works similarly to how it did on the PS4, but it's nice to be able to see a preview in Cards.\nSpeaking of social features, if you're tired of typing out messages using a D-pad or analog stick, the PS5 also supports voice dictation for messaging thanks to the DualSense controller's built-in mic. You can also use PS5 voice commands to open games, apps and put the console in Rest Mode.\nWhile your mileage may vary when it comes to the accuracy of the dictation (as with all voice recognition software), it could prove handy when you need to fire off a quick message to a friend. We did find it to be inconsistent in our testing, though, and not as accurate as something like Google Assistant.\nWe also like the fact you can choose system-wide settings for certain aspects on PS5 such as your preferred difficulty level or whether you invert the x or y-axis on your controller during games. You can even choose which graphical mode you prefer games to automatically select: performance or resolution.\nPS5: streaming video services and other apps\nOf course, game consoles can do more than just provide your thumbs with something to do - modern consoles are also full-on streaming video players.\nRight now, you'll find over a dozen supported streaming services on the PS5 including most major services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Peacock and Apple TV, as well as a few more niche services like Twitch, NFL Sunday Ticket, ESPN, Vudu, Tubi, WWE Network and Crunchyroll. The selection here isn't as big as you'd find on, say, a Roku streaming player, but it should be enough for most.\nThe worse news is that, as it stands, there's no support anywhere on the console Dolby Vision. We thought we might it them appear on launch day, but it never materialized. Support was later added for Dolby Atmos, however.\nWhat that means, unfortunately, is that the PS5 is really only a middling media player - it can't best dedicated streamers like the Nvidia Shield, Amazon Fire TV Cube, Apple TV 4K or the new Roku Ultra, and isn't the console we'd recommend to our cinephile friends looking to host movie night with the highest fidelity films.\nPS5 review: game library\n- Every PS5 comes with Astro\u2019s Playroom installed\n- PlayStation Plus Collection is a great introduction to new players\n- Limited backwards compatibility with PS3, PS2 and PS One games\nMost consoles don't launch with a full library of games right off the bat, so the launch bar was pretty low for the PS5. That being said, what you make of the PlayStation 5's current game library largely depends on if you finished the masterpieces from the PS4's era \u2013 games like God of War, The Last of Us Part 2, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.\nIf you haven't finished them, or haven't played them at all, you could have over a dozen excellent games to play from the second you turn on the PS5 via backwards compatibility, a number of which have been improved thanks to a 60fps update, like Ghost of Tsushima and Days Gone.\nIf you have PS Plus, you might also have access to some older games that passed you by. Every PS5 comes pre-installed with Astro's Playroom, too, and it's a thrilling showcase for what the system can do.\nA fully fleshed-out sequel to Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, Astro's Playroom is a platformer that features exotic locales in which are hidden artifacts from Sony's PlayStation hardware catalog. You'll find a PlayStation VR Aim Controller hidden in a snowbank somewhere in one level, for example, while another level might contain a PlayStation Portable for you to discover.\nIt's a nice homage to the PlayStation hardware that's come and gone, but we expect some folks will play through it, then uninstall it to reclaim the 10GB of storage space it takes up on the console. You can always re-download it from your games library or the PlayStation Store should you wish to play it again.\nBut what else is there to play if you pick up a PS5 today? Well, the PS5 library mostly consists of cross-generation titles at the moment and is helped greatly by the fact it\u2019s fully backward compatible with PS4.\nHowever, the list of noteworthy PS5 games is growing and includes some first-party heavy hitters like Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Demon\u2019s Souls, The Last of Us: Part 1, God of War Ragnarok, Horizon Forbidden West, Returnal, and Gran Turismo 7. You can also pick up some big third-party games like Resident Evil Village, Stray, Saints Row, Elden Ring, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\nThere are also various independent games that are worth a shout, like the indie charmer Bugsnax (that one with the infuriatingly catchy theme tune), which was available as the console's first PlayStation Plus downloadable game.\nWe'll continue to keep an eye out for the best PS5 games as the console matures and you can keep track of all the new PS5 games on the way.\nPS5: backward compatibility\nWhat about folks who want to play older games? Well, the PlayStation 5 can play almost any PS4 game but not everything is compatible, though the incompatible games list is miniscule. There's no way to pop in a PS3 disc and have it work or transfer over your PlayStation Classics purchases you made on the PS Vita a few years ago.\nWe're as disappointed as you are with the lack of backward-compatibility support for Sony\u2019s previous generation of games, particularly as Xbox 360 and original Xbox games (physical discs included) work on the Xbox Series X, but it's not uncommon for a new console to only support the last generation of games as manufacturers look to the future.\nIt used to be that you could choose select PS3/PS2 titles via PlayStation Now\u2026 but that's been replaced with a revamped PS Plus service, which also includes PS1 and PSP games. Accessing your old PS4 games is thankfully a cinch on Sony's new system, though. Simply select the Library icon and the PS5 will automatically pull in all your digital purchases and previously installed games, providing you're signed in to your PlayStation Network account.\nYou'll need to redownload them to the console, of course, or insert the physical disc to activate a game's license. Some games have been upgraded to run better than ever on PS5, too, like Days Gone, which now runs at a silky-smooth 60fps, while God of War can now comfortably hit its 60 frames per second target using the game\u2019s performance mode.\nOne thing to note is that you may notice your save file is missing when you boot up a PS4 game that you previously owned for the first time \u2013 that's because you'll need to redownload your save files from the cloud onto your PS5 console first. Here's how to transfer PS4 save data to PS5.\nPS Plus members have access to cloud saves, but if you haven't been backing up your save files over the air, then you may notice your data won\u2019t be there initially. It's not the most seamless system, admittedly, and is bound to confuse some users, but support for carrying over your save files appears to be there for most of the older titles we tested \u2013 however, this will vary on a case by case basis.\nShould I buy the PS5?\nBuy it if...\nYou plan on buying a new game console in the next six months\nThe PS5 is a seriously great next-gen gaming console \u2013 and one we\u2019ll be recommending to our friends and families for a while yet. The new controller is revolutionary, and the whole experience feels fresh, fast, and satisfying to use.\nYou want a taste of current-gen without losing your PS4 games\nOne of the best things about the PlayStation 5 is that it acts as a bridge between generations. Your entire library of digital PS4 games is there from the moment you log into your PSN account, and any great games you missed will likely be part of the PlayStation Plus Collection.\nYou're tired of loading screens and ready for higher frame rates\nThe marquee features of the PS5 are its SSD, which significantly reduces the time it takes for games to start up, and its cutting-edge GPU, which enables ray-traced graphics and resolutions up to 4K at 120fps \u2013 and, possibly, all the way up to 8K/60fps in the future.\nDon't buy if...\nYou're looking for a great Dolby Vision Blu-ray player\nIf you're a home media enthusiast who has a collection of 4K Dolby Vision Blu-rays at home and a Dolby Atmos speaker system, you probably won't love the PS5. Yes, it will be able to play 4K Blu-Ray discs, but because it doesn't support Dolby Vision's cutting-edge format, we won't be recommending it to the audiovisual community.\nYou want to play loads of native PS5 games\nThe PS5's exclusive game catalog is growing, but still a little on the small side. That doesn't mean things won't improve; they most certainly will, but as it stands, don't expect to be overwhelmed with options.\nYour home console setup is cramped already\nIt might not be an issue for some, but it's worth calling attention to how big the original PS5 is one last time. If you're short on space, and you physically don't have room for a gargantuan console on your entertainment center or desk, then you might want to hold off, but this has been somewhat addressed with the slimmer, updated PS5 model.\nAlso consider...\nXbox Series X\nMicrosoft's flagship console is a great alternative to the PS5 if you prefer games like Halo Infinite and Forza. It also offers unique features such as Quick Resume that lets you flick between several games at a time without having to close them.\nXbox Series S\nThe smallest Xbox ever made, if you're looking for a gateway into next-gen gaming, the Xbox Series S offers excellent performance for an affordable price. Make sure you pick up Xbox Game Pass, too.\nNintendo Switch OLED\nNintendo's latest iteration of the Switch is the best one yet. With a gorgeous OLED screen, redesigned kickstand and speakers, the Switch OLED is the perfect second system. You can also play it anywhere, anytime.\nFirst reviewed: November 2020.\nHow we test\nWe pride ourselves on our independence and our rigorous review-testing process, offering up long-term attention to the products we review and making sure our reviews are updated and maintained - regardless of when a device was released, if you can still buy it, it's on our radar.\nAdam was formerly TRG's Hardware Editor.

      "text": "I tested three mid-range sim racing wheels \u2013 and it turns out the cheapest is the best\nMid-range wheels for every budget \u2013 but which offers the best value?\nRacing wheels provide greater immersion and control when playing motorsport sims. They\u2019re a must-have for die-hard fans of the genre, although such players are usually in the market for full-on simulator rigs that can run into the thousands. Thankfully, though, there are plenty of affordable models catering to more casual virtual racers, as well as those wishing to dip their toes in or who want a wheel that won\u2019t take up their entire living space.\nThere are now plenty of reasonably priced examples around, and their numbers continue to grow. Thrustmaster is one of the most prominent wheel vendors in the sector, and is responsible for making some of the best racing wheels, but more and more brands are joining the party.\nTo that end, I recently tested three racing wheels: the Thrustmaster TX, the Thrustmaster T128, and the Hori Force Feedback Racing Wheel DLX. These wheels cover various price points within the wider mid-range racing wheel bracket \u2013 and I\u2019m happy to report, the best of the bunch might just be the cheapest.\nThrustmaster TX\nAs the most expensive of the three, the TX has a lot to live up to. Thankfully, its features and build quality suggest that indeed it can.\nLike many other racing wheels, it comes with a clamping system to fix to your desk, although I found it a little awkward to install when I reviewed it. The central screw can be awkward to tighten, and the whole process isn\u2019t helped by the sheer heft of the wheel base itself; while reassuring, it makes it more difficult to support while attaching the clamp.\nHowever, unlike the other two wheels, the TX has the advantage of being fixable to a racing stand, thanks to the added screw holes underneath the wheel and pedal bases, which will please those after a more refined experience.\nThe overall build quality of the TX is pretty good, too, being the best of the three. The wheel itself is solid and finished in a perforated, soft-grip material that feels comfortable yet hard-wearing. I also liked the flat yet thick rim, fitting my hands well.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe TX is also superior in terms of performance. Turns are very smooth, even when making minimal corrections, lacking the prominent notchiness that can plague other racing wheels. It\u2019s also very responsive, which emphasizes the connection to in-game vehicles.\nThe pedals are similarly tactile, with the brake pedal being a particular highlight in this regard, with the right amount of resistance to provide feedback without being onerous to use repeatedly. The throttle is perhaps a little too light for my liking, but I still found it smooth and accurate enough.\nPlayStation and Xbox variants are available, and thankfully, both are compatible with PC as well.\nHori Force Feedback Racing Wheel DLX\nTrue to its price tag, the build quality of the Hori sits somewhere in between the TX and the T128. I was particularly fond of the wheel itself, with its partially soft-grip material and ergonomic curves in the ten-and-two position that accommodated my thumbs well.\nI was also pleased with the installation process, with its lightweight body and superior clamp to the TX, making it easy to attach. The buttons impressed me too, with a reliable operation and a layout that makes them easy to use blind.\nHowever, the Hori\u2019s paddles have a usability issue: frequently, my thumbs would get caught between them and the rim when turning about 180 degrees and beyond, which is uncomfortable and could potentially cause harm.\nI also experienced inconsistent performance with the Hori. It worked well with Assetto Corsa, offering accurate inputs, but felt at odds with Forza Motorsport, as in-game cars failed to track precisely. The force feedback also left a lot to be desired, kicking in far too suddenly without much finesse or imparting much information, again, feeling disconnected with what was actually happening.\nThe pedals perform more consistently, and the brake pedal again offers a pleasing amount of resistance and feedback. The throttle is less tactile, but still usable, and includes a clutch pedal, just like the TX, which is nice to see at this price point.\nUnlike the other two wheels, the Hori is only compatible with Xbox consoles, which is a shame considering its price tag. The mixed performance is also somewhat of a concern, which means ultimately, the Hori might not be the best value racing wheel you can get.\nThrustmaster T128\nThe T128 is the cheapest wheel here. It\u2019s similarly priced to the T150, which we think is one of the best PS5 racing wheels for those on a budget, so the brand knows how to make a great racing wheel at a relatively modest price.\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t make a particularly auspicious start, as the T128 is perhaps the worst in terms of build quality. The plastics feel cheap in the hand and don\u2019t seem particularly sturdy, owing to their lightness.\nThankfully, there\u2019s nothing outright troubling about its construction, and it suffices for the purposes of light sim racing. Even the paddles feel quite good on the T128, which is usually an area where budget racing wheels can fall down.\nMuch like the wheel, the pedal set of the T128 is made of cheaper-feeling plastics. They also feel very light to press, but they work well in-game, and I was impressed that the base had enough grip on carpeted surfaces to stop it from sliding away, despite how little it weighs.\nThe T128 doesn't have a clutch pedal, but this only works in its favor by keeping its cost and size to a minimum. I could be wrong here, but I reckon most gamers after an affordable racing wheel aren't concerned with having a shifter also. This is usually the preserve of serious sim racers, who'll also likely be after one of the best direct drive racing wheels instead, which are generally much costlier than any of the three here.\nSteering is light but accurate on the T128, which, coupled with its small diameter, can make it a blast to chuck around when tearing up the virtual tarmac or gravel. The aforementioned lightness of the pedals can be a problem in terms of imparting feedback, especially concerning the brake pedal, but they\u2019re still informative enough to allow for control. I didn\u2019t find the layout cramped, either, which I\u2019ve found with other pedal sets I\u2019ve tried, including the Hori\u2019s.\nWhen you consider its price, the T128 delivers much more than you might expect in terms of performance. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s compatible with Windows as well as console platforms, hence its additional inclusion in our best PC racing wheels guide.\nWhich one to buy?\nThe T128 certainly doesn't feel the most premium, especially next to the TX. However, it\u2019s still functional and can withstand the rigors of light sim racing. It might not perform quite so well as the TX, but it\u2019s still very admirable at this price point.\nIt beats the more expensive Hori, too, since it offers a smoother and more user-friendly performance. What\u2019s more, the Hori is also only compatible with Xbox consoles, whereas the T128 works on multiple platforms.\nIf your budget stretches to the TX, then that is probably the one to plumb for, since it\u2019s the superior of the three in terms of design and performance. But in terms of sheer value for the money, the T128 is hard to beat, and I think it\u2019s certainly one of the best budget racing wheels you can buy right now.\nYou might also like...\n- Move over ROG Xbox Ally, the real first portable Xbox is here and it\u2019s a gorgeous VR headset\n- I test Meta Quest 3 games for a living \u2013 here are my 6 favorite deals from Meta's Mega Summer Sale\n- Nacon Revolution X Unlimited vs Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot \u2013 here\u2019s what I learned testing two of the year\u2019s most interesting Xbox controllers\nLewis Maddison is a Reviews Writer for TechRadar.

I previously worked for the UK's Official PlayStation Magazine, and now cover all things gaming at TechRadar.\nGood afternoon gamers!\nThis is the very start of my Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 coverage. If you're just tuning in, then don't worry - you haven't missed anything yet!\nWith the show set to take this evening, I'll be walking you through the build up, sharing the latest news as it happens, and a few of my own personal predictions then bringing you a steady stream of announcements once the broadcast begins.\nICYMI: the latest Nintendo Direct is underway\nIt's not technically part of Gamescom, but the timing of this latest Nintendo Direct is definitely deliberate and likely an attempt by Nintendo to squeeze in their own short presentation before attention shifts to the big Opening Night Live show.\nThe Direct is focused on the upcoming racing game Kirby Air Riders, and is our first real look at the title since its announcement back the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this year.\nThe broadcast is currently live right now, so you can tune in if you're interested in learning all about it.\nIs Hollow Knight: Silksong news on the cards?\nHollow Knight: Silksong is easily one of the most anticipated games right now. A sequel to the 2017 indie hit, fans have been waiting for more news about this upcoming instalment for more than six years.\nCould we hear more about it tonight? It's definitely likely, as presenter Geoff Keighley has been teasing something Silksong related.\nYesterday, he posted a photo of himself wearing a clown nose to his X / Twitter account, captioned \"First time? See you tomorrow for Gamescom ONL.\" It might not seem like much, but it's a reference popular meme featuring the protagonist of Hollow Knight wearing a similar clown costume.\nFirst time? \ud83e\udd21 See you tomorrow for @gamescom ONL. pic.twitter.com/59ef5sFysJAugust 18, 2025\nHe actually posted the original meme last year, alongside clarification that there would be \"no Silksong\", so this seems like an intentional call-back.\nHopefully we're in for some kind of exciting update regarding the game tonight.\nWe're in for a live music performance\nGeoff Keighley has confirmed that we will be in some music tonight.\nIt will be the first ever live performance of music from the popular RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from composers Alice Duport-Percier and Lorien Testard.\nExactly which songs will be performed is currently up in the air, but lovers of the game definitely won't want to miss this...\nShare your own thoughts or predictions\nHave any burning Opening Night Live thoughts or predictions?\nYou can send them my way by posting to X / Twitter and tagging us @techradar! Alternatively, you can email me directly using the handy email button at the top of my author page.\nWhether you have created your own bingo card, have a list of wild hopes and dreams, or just want to offer some comments on the whole Opening Night Show, I'll be sharing the very best contributions here on this page throughout the evening.\nJust remember to keep it PG, or I'll get in big trouble with my boss and we don't want that, do we?\nExpect a Lords of the Fallen 2 reveal\nIt looks like Lords of the Fallen 2 will be revealed later tonight, following a fairly transparent teaser posted by the official Lords of the Fallen X / Twitter account.\nThe image, which shows part of a character in gothic armor, features the word \"tonight\" with the letter \"i\" replaced by the Roman numeral for two.\nThe knightmare looms\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZR1KNE9wa1August 19, 2025\nI was a fan of the latest Lords of the Fallen game, which released back in 2023. In fact, I did a expansive cover feature with a multiple-page preview of the title back when I worked on the UK's PlayStation Magazine, so it's a series that's pretty close to my heart\nDespite the name, Lords of the Fallen 2 would actually be the third Lords of the Fallen game. That's because of 2014's Lords of the Fallen, which is not to be confused with its 2023 successor.\nOur agents on the ground have arrived\nI might be stuck behind a computer screen this year, but that doesn't mean that we don't have some agents on the ground right now.\nMy colleagues Rhys and Rob reached Cologne, Germany, this morning and are currently scouting things out and attending a few early appointments ahead of Opening Night Live.\nThey tell me it's quite quiet over there at the moment, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm expecting all of that to change as the show nears.\nThere will be a ZZZ car at Gamescom 2025\nThis is a bit of a weird one, but I have received confirmation that there will be at least one automobile present in the halls at Gamescom 2025.\nIt's a special version of the Aston Martin Vantage coupe, with custom artwork based on the Victoria Housekeeping Co. faction from Zenless Zone Zero.\nIt will be showed off at the game's booth in Hall 6, booth C-031, where visitors will be able to bask in all of its glory. Those going to the booth will also be able to complete check-in missions, and win prizes including a special 1:18 scale model of the Aston Martin car.\nYou can find full details on the competition via the X / Twitter post below.\nAston Martin \u00d7 Zenless Zone Zero Collab: Gamescom Event AnnouncementDear Proxies, complete missions at the event site to receive exclusive collab merch! You'll also have a chance to win a limited edition 1:18 scale model car of the 2024 Aston Martin Vantage!#zzzero\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6JsKf8qBh7August 18, 2025\nLast year Hoyoverse had a huge booth in the public area, and I expect Gamescom 2025 to be no different.\nThe brand's presence at the trade show also suggests that there will be some interesting announcements during the Opening Night Live show, potentially new seasonal content for games Zenless Zone Zero or Genshin Impact.\nWe're going to learn all things Black Ops 7\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be getting an expansive trailer as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025. The follow-up to the successful Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, this next entry takes the series back to a futuristic setting for the first time in years.\nIt's set in 2035 and will feature a co-op campaign set right after the events of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. As usual, you can expect expect a wealth of multiplayer modes and a separate zombies mode too.\nThe game was first revealed back in the June Xbox Games Showcase, with a trippy cinematic trailer that showed off its dark tone and plenty of futuristic technology.\nWe also know that Black Ops 2 protagonist David Mason will be returning. Leaks also indicate that fan-favorite villain Raul Menendez will play an import role in the plot, which is set to take place across both Japan and Avalon - a fictional European city featured in Black Ops 6.\nThe game is set to release on November 14, 2025, so it's about time we learned more about it.\nWe've finally got some Hollow Knight: Silksong news!\nThis is not a drill - we finally have some official news about Hollow Knight: Silksong!\nDeveloper Team Cherry will be hosting a 'Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement' in just under 48 hours time.\nWhat will this 'special announcement' be? It's too early to say, but I think that it's almost certainly going to be a release date of some kind.\nBloomberg reporter Jason Schreier is claiming that there won't be a Silksong release date tonight, but I wouldn't be surprised if we still see a trailer.\nNot feeling the hype? Check out this sizzle reel\nYou can catch a Gamescom Opening Night Live sizzle reel over on the official Game Awards YouTube channel, potentially giving us some insight into what's in store.\nIt features loads of titles, with some of the most significant being Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Ghost of Yotei, and Resident Evil Requiem. I also spotted some Silent Hill f in there, not to mention a clip from the Fallout TV show.\nJust under three hours to go...\nWe're now just under three hours away from the start of the Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show!\nThat's plenty of time to get anything done that you might want out of the way before the action begins. You're going to want to make sure that you have a clear schedule, as this year's show is shaping up to be massive.\nQueues are starting to form\nGeoff Keighley has posted an update from the Opening Night Live 2025 venue, showing plenty of eager gamers waiting to get in to the show.\nFans have been lining up all day to get into @gamescom ONL tonight -- see you all soon!! pic.twitter.com/RCrwRXajDDAugust 19, 2025\nTickets are currently sold-out, so I'm expecting the hall to be absolutely packed tonight.\nDon't forget about the pre-show!\nThe main Gamescom Opening Night Live stream might be the biggest attraction, but that doesn't mean that you should forget about the pre-show.\nSet to start 30 minutes before the main event, Keighley has already confirmed that it will \"have multiple new game announcements\".\nThey're generally smaller titles than the ones that that are featured in the main event, but if you have an interest in indies you might see something that you really like the look of.\nYou'll be able to watch it via the regular Opening Night Live stream too, so it's the perfect thing to have on in the background before the event begins in full.\nThe cutest gaming hardware of Gamescom?\nRemember those early appointments that I mentioned? My colleague Rob has just been to see ASUS and spotted some absolutely adorable PC hardware.\nIt comes as part of the Asus x Hatsune Miku collection, with special TUF gaming gear based on the design of the iconic virtual singer. All of it looks incredible, and I'd love to have it as part of my PC setup.\nI most like the look of the special edition TUF Gaming H1 Gen 2 headset, not to mention the TUF Gaming Mini Wireless Mouse and TUF Gaming K3 Gen 2 keyboard. Of course, the matching TUF Gaming P1 mouse pad is an essential too.\nCould this be the cutest gaming hardware that we will see over Gamescom? It's a definite possibility.\nWe'll be getting new info on the Fallout TV show\nWe already know that we will be seeing more of the Fallout TV show tonight in a first look at its second season.\nI was a big fan of the original season, which is an Amazon Prime Video exclusive. The storytelling isn't the best around, but it's still an impressively faithful adaptation of the games' world. It's got plenty of action and a surprising amount of gore, but also the franchise's trademark comedic elements to balance it all out.\nI'm hoping that we will see some other Fallout reveals tonight on top of the show, ideally a remaster or remake of one of the older games. With the second season on the way, it would be the perfect time to revisit Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas.\nPlayable Silksong has been sighted!\nFull #SilkSong Nintendo Booth @ Gamescom pic.twitter.com/xMdlIQpfwpAugust 19, 2025\nHere's some big news for anyone waiting for Hollow Knight: Silksong out there.\nThe game will apparently be available to play at a large Gamescom booth in a demo that seems to be running on Nintnedo Switch 2 systems.\nThe information comes from a streamer, who has posted some interesting videos that they claim were taken from inside the halls at Gamescom.\nThe demo stations currently appear to be password protected though, so I don't think we're going to see any real gameplay until the event is fully open.\nJust one hour to go...\nHere's an important time reminder for you!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show is now exactly one hour away with the pre-show set to begin in just 30 minutes.\nGrab some snacks and get comfy, because it will be here before you know it...\nOur on-site team are starting to head to the venue\nI've just received an update from our crew on the ground, who are now busy making their way over to the Opening Night Live venue.\nI'll be able to give you some updates on what the atmosphere is like over there once they arrive!\nThe first Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 images are here!\nThe Xbox store page for Black Ops 7 has been updated ahead of the show, giving us our first look at some in-game screenshots!\nWe see plenty of robots, as you might expect given the futuristic setting, and what are likely some launch multiplayer maps. There are also some soldiers wearing very Black Ops 2 inspired body armor, plus a glimpse of the Zombies crew.\nYou can see them all for yourself here.\nWe've arrived!\nOur team has arrived at Gamescom 2025!\nHere's the current situation outside the convention center. It's not super busy, but we already know from Keighley's posts that lots of people are waiting indoors for Opening Night Live 2025 to begin.\nLook at that lovely clear sky though. I'm a little jealous...\nThe pre-show has officially begun\nHold on to something! The Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 pre-show has officially begun. Now is the time to get the stream open in your browser window (or tune in above), as the announcements start right now.\nThe pre-show is usually home to smaller indie games, with the bigger reveals saved for the main event. That doesn't mean that it isn't worth watching though, as you might see something that you really like the look of.\nFresh photos from the show\nMy team on the ground has been feeding me a steady stream of photos from inside the hall, where the atmosphere looks electric.\nYou can browse some of them above, including a beautiful selfie from both Rob and Rhys. Look how happy they are!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show has started!\nIt's happening folks!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show has now started.\nThe man, the myth, the legend Geoff Keighley is on stage right now, so expect the announcements to start coming thick and fast.\nOf course, I'll be here to keep you up to date with everything as it happens.\nHere's a look at Keighley's outfit for the night - not too shabby. Not sure about the tan shoes, though...\nHe's currently welcoming the audience to the show and has said that \"E3 didn't die, it just moved right here to Germany.\"\nHe has now moved on to the usual talk about the industry, reflecting on the success of indie games Peak and Date Everything...\nWe've now moved onto Hollow Knight: Silksong, which Keighley promises will launch this year! There's some gameplay on screen too!\nWas that it? That was about ten seconds of Silksong action. Hopefully the upcoming Team Cherry stream will shed a lot more light on the game.\nWe're starting with Black Ops 7!\nIt looks like we're going to kick things off properly with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7!\nThe trailer seems to be really focusing on the campaign, showing some absolutely bonkers looking visuals with scenes of twisting skyscrapers and all kinds of strangeness.\nWe're also getting a look at what I assume is the central cast of characters, which makes sense given the apparent co-op focus.\nAnd a quick look at multiplayer too it seems and zombies! Now the developers are on stage to outline some of the themes of the game and explore its 2035 setting.\nOh! Now some more details on the co-op campaign. It will be playable with up to four players, or solo if you prefer.\nIt seems that missions will be quite open this time around, which is reminding me a little too much of the incredibly lacklustre open-world levels in Modern Warfare 3.\nEver wondered if Keighley is reading an auto-cue? Our team on the ground can now officially confirm... yes!\nLords of the Fallen 2 revealed!\nNo we're on to the first proper game reveal of the show!\nIt's Lords of the Fallen 2, in a flashy cinematic trailer that showcases some impressive looking visuals. It's got the same style as its predecessor, but is set 100 years after the previous game.\nKeighley described it as both \"bloodier\" and \"faster\", which is promising! It's set to come out in 2026\nHere's an unexpected reveal!\nAn anime based on Sekiro Shadows Die Twice called Sekiro No Defeat has been unveiled. It will be available on the Crunchyroll streaming service.\nA new Lego Batman game is coming\nA new Lego game has been shown off, and it looks stunning! Lego Batman Legacy of the Dark Knight.\nIt seems to have a massive open world, plus some Arkham series inspired combat. It'll be here in 2026.\nA developer is on stage to tell us that Lego Legacy of the Dark Knight demo will be available on the show floor.\nThe game will track the entire of Bruce Wayne's journey it seems, with plenty of iconic moments and \"deep cut references\".\nAs with previous Lego games, I'm expecting a wide roster of playable characters taken from across the Batman universe.\nOn to the next game, a \"long awaited sequel\" that fans have been eager to see...\nNo, it's not Bloodborne 2.\nIt's a new Warhammer strategy game! Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4!\nIt will be out in 2026!\nSome Monster Hunter Wilds news now! A Final Fantasy 14 collaboration, plus a new Title Update that introduces a new monster.\nBoth are coming in \"late September\" - whatever that means.\nRy\u014dz\u014d Tsujimoto and Naoki Yoshida (or Yoshi-P) from Capcom have taken to the stage to discuss the crossover!\nThis upcoming crossover apparently came about after the success of a similar Final Fantasy crossover in Monster Hunter World.\nOur resident Final Fantasy 14-head Rhys, who is currently sat watching the show in Cologne, is very happy with this news it seems.\nWe've just seen some screenshots of the event in Final Fantasy 14, with a new mount and what looks like a Monster Hunter Wilds quest.\nThat is coming later this year in October.\nWhat the heck is this? Some kind of horror game, I thought it was Resident Evil at first but now I'm not sure if it's another Capcom title or not.\nTurns out it's not a game! It's a trailer for... Gamescom?\nSome Onimusha: Way of the Sword action now!\nIt looks like a lot of fun, with some meaty combat and creepy, undead enemies in an ancient Japanese setting.\nSome kind of anime game now? I think we might be back.\nWe're seeing loads of interesting visuals, it looks like it'll be some kind of factory management game? With some combat thrown in there too.\nHow unique!\nIt's Arknights: Endfield! Off the top of my head, that's one that's been announced for some time, but the fresh look is still appreciated.\nA proper strategy game sequel now!\nEuropa Universalis 5 - fans of staring at maps all day will undoubtedly love this one.\nA fresh Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion trailer! There's a demo available today, if you're interested in trying out a cool-looking mech game.\nA little first-person shooter game now, called Voidbreaker. It's out now!\nWe have actors on stage!\nI repeat, actors on stage. Some of the cast of the Fallout TV show are here, to discuss the upcoming season. It sounds like it will be a direct continuation of the first season, which probably isn't much of a surprise.\nNow it's time for a teaser trailer ahead of the season's release in December!\nHere's a quick look at the posters for that upcoming season!\nNow it's time for some Indiana Jones DLC action\nTime for a proper look at the The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\nIt looks like the perfect continuation of everything that made the base game so good, and it'll be here on September 4.\nWonder what I thought of the original game? Check out my Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review!\nWe also just got confirmation that the game will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026!\nAnother trailer for the Deadpool VR game. It sure looks like a Deadpool game, and it's absolutely in VR.\nIt's coming as a Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusive.\nTime for a fresh world premiere!\nThere's a tank on screen, are we looking at some kind of World of Tanks spinoff? Maybe a strategy game? Let's see...\nI called it! It's World of Tanks 2.0 - the \"biggest update in the game's history\".\nTime for some John Carpenter's Toxic Commando action in an extended gameplay trailer. It's got co-op, it's got shooting, and it's sure got some weird mutant enemies.\nThe game is set to release in \"early 2026\".\nTime for something a bit different, a game called Death by Scrolling.\nIt's a roguelike set in purgatory, with cute pixel graphics. The big feature of this one seems to be that the screen is constantly scrolling upwards as you play, which is pretty unique.\nOh, you'll also be chased by the grim reaper - so look out for that.\nSomething from the Disco Elyisum studio ZA/UM!\nAn espionage RPG, with a weird tone and the same incredible art style as its predecessor. Zero Parades is the name.\nA Neverness to Everness trailer here.\nWow this game looks absolutely stunning. It's one that I've been keeping my eyes on for awhile, so I'll definitely be pre-registering after the show.\nAnother game on my wishlist now!\nUnbeatable, an absolutely gorgeous rhythm adventure that's coming out on November 6 - yippee!\nHonor of Kings: World, a lovely looking spin-off based on the incredibly popular mobile MMO. It's more of an action-RPG, which is good news for me because I'm absolutely hopeless at MMOs.\nDelta Force is out right now on console!\nI was a big fan of this game back at its mobile launch, so I'll be checking out the PS5 release for sure.\nNow on to the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 live performance, which is the emotional song Alicia.\nAnd here's a photo of the performance live from the hall!\nTime for the first gameplay reveal of Cinder City, a shooter MMO set in a post-apocalyptic Seoul.\nI'm seeing lots of multiplayer battles and creepy zombie enemies. Ewww, that's some pretty nasty gore, too.\nSome absolutely wild looking game also from NCSoft now, starring heroes taken from across history battling it out in a really strange world.\nIt's all Time Takers, and I'm liking the look of the character designs.\nA fresh Silent Hill f trailer now, and wow it looks gorgeous!\nThe protagonist might be a young girl, but she seems to be pretty capable with a lead pipe as we see her bludgeoning all kinds of scary creatures.\nOn to a fresh game!\nI'm getting lots of soulslike vibes from the combat here, which has an armored protagonist going head to head with a mystical looking creature.\nIt's called La Divina Commedia, and is presumably something to do with the poem.\nCronos The New Dawn now, with a guy wearing the protagonist's suit on stage plus an all-new trailer showing off its lovely looking Poland setting and raft of horrifying enemies.\nNow it's time for something from Obsidian - The Outer Worlds 2 I suspect.\nNew The Outer Worlds 2 trailer\nAs predicted, it's a new trailer for The Outer Worlds 2 focusing predominantly on its companions.\nThere's a funny robot, a weird assassin, some strange cultist person, another funny robot, and a guy.\nAll bases are covered here, it seems.\nThe trailer also confirmed that you will NOT be able to sleep with any of the companions, and gave us an October 29 release date.\nInzoi Island Getaway on screen as I type this, a new free expansion for Inzoi.\nI didn't really like this game when it launched in early access earlier this year, but maybe this will be enough to get me to give it another shot.\nIt'll be out tomorrow, so I'll sleep on it before I decide.\nAnother anime game now, with guns! This is my kind of thing.\nIt's called Fate Trigger and will be playable in early 2026.\nAn online game based on the The Seven Deadly Sins anime now! I know absolutely nothing about the source material, so this one is a bit lost on me.\nA look at Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, followed by Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2. It's sequel extravaganza!\nThe latter also got a release date at long long last: 21 October 2025.\nAn Enshrouded expansion now - Enshrouded Wake of the Water set to come out in October. Good news for fans of the survival game, not such good news if, like me, you had never heard of it.\nAge of Empires 4 is coming to PS5! Complete with an all-new expansion.\nPre-order now, ahead of a November 4, 2025 release.\nNow here's something more up my street! A Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 expansion: Legacy of the Forge.\nWe've got some Cult of the Lamb news up! Is this going to be a free update, a sequel, or a new expansion? Let's see...\nThat's a \"massive paid expansion\" according to some on-screen text - that answers my question!\nIt's called Woolhaven and will be here in early 2026.\nWorld of Warcraft time!\nIt's time for a cinematic look at World of Warcraft: Midnight, the MMO's 11th expansion!\nThese cinematics are generally really high quality, so I'm looking forward to this.\nThere's been a noticeable lack of Resident Evil Requiem so far. Is something big from that game going to be the final reveal? It's definitely possible.\nA new project from Delta Force developers Team Jade! A tactical shooter this time, with an interesting horror skew.\nAnother title from the Wargaming, the World of Tanks devs.\nI'm seeing tanks, I'm seeing planes. Lots of explosions.\nThe official title is Heat!\nGhost of Yotei trailer time! With plenty of action from our protagonist Atsu and another look at the stunning open-world setting.\nThe combat still looks absolutely fantastic, and the colors on some of these scenes are gorgeous.\nWe've also just had out look at Ghost of Yotei Legends - a free multiplayer DLC that will come later in 2026! That's pretty cool.\nOkay, it's Resident Evil time...\nThe trailer is all about protagonist Grace Ashcroft and has confirmed that her mother Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak is going to be in the game!\nIt looks like we're seeing the hotel where parts of the game are set, presumably some time before her mother's death.\nWell, that guy is very dead.\nIt's almost over, with just one last surprise to go! A \"global announcement\" of some kind?\nA Game Science release! That's the Black Myth: Wukong developers. I suspect we're about to see another soulslike...\nWe've got two guys with comedy British accents on screen, plus a massive tiger. What could this be?\nIt's Black Myth: Zhong Kui! It'll be another single-player action RPG based on another part of Chinese mythology.\nIt's over!\nWhat did you think of the show?\nI thought it was pretty underwhelming, if I'm being honest."

It features in our other racing wheel buying guides for a reason; the sheer quality on offer here matched with a reasonable mid-range price point makes it the best overall choice for racing fans.\nThe Logitech G923 outshines much of its competition in terms of build quality, overall customizability, and in-game performance. You\u2019re getting a set of three pedals here (throttle, brake, and clutch) as well as a wheelbase already attached. These factors alone make the G923 perfect for beginners who just want to plug in and play from the go.\nThe Logitech G923 is also supported by pretty much all of the best racing games that are worth playing today. Be that Forza Horizon 5, EA Sports WRC, F1 24, or even Need for Speed Unbound, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a racer that doesn\u2019t support Logitech\u2019s wheel. Even though it\u2019s a few years old at this point, it still remains an excellent choice and our PC racing wheel recommendation for most players.\nComing in at $399.99 / \u00a3349.99 / AU$799, the Logitech G923 offers great value too but it is also subject to frequent price drops throughout the year. It\u2019s been a stalwart PC racing wheel for a number of years, and it\u2019ll be hard to beat going forward.\n- Read more: Logitech G923 review\nThe best budget PC racing wheel\n2. Thrustmaster T128\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re not looking to spend much: The Thrustmaster T128 provides incredible value for money at its relatively lower asking price and it's packed with great features.\n\u274c You're a stalwart racing simmer: If you want all the racing wheel bells and whistles and better build quality, consider shopping for a pricier wheel if you're able.\nWant an affordable PC racing wheel that\u2019s blissfully simple to set up? Then look no further than the Thrustmaster T128. With superb features that you won\u2019t often find at this price point outside of a sale, the T128 really stands out as a budget option.\nThe Thrustmaster T128 is the PC racing wheel we recommend if you want a quality racing experience while still saving a bit of cash. Coming in cheaper than this list\u2019s Logitech options, it offers a comparable experience with 900-degree rotation and a decent amount of force feedback for more immersive driving. The inclusion of a wheelbase, pedals and a simple layout of action buttons also make it a very approachable racing wheel for players who just want to get stuck in with little fuss.\nWhile we\u2019ve yet to review the Thrustmaster T128, we suggest reading the Thrustmaster T128 review over at our sister site, GamesRadar+, which described it as \u201ca great entry-level rig,\" and one that offers \u201ca taste of what great force-feedback can add to sim racing.\u201d\n- Stay tuned for our full Thrustmaster T128 review coming soon\nThe best premium PC racing wheel\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want robust features and customization: With a quick-release system and a huge amount of action buttons, the T-GT 2 is ideal for sim-heads who frequently adjust their setups.\n\u274c You\u2019re new to PC racing wheels: If you're a first-time purchaser, the T-GT 2 isn't quite ideal with its price tag and overwhelming litany of features.\nWhen it comes to the best PC racing wheels, the Thrustmaster T-GT 2 is an easy pick for the best premium choice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the giant Gran Turismo logo in the center of the wheel; it\u2019s still compatible with PC and makes for a top-flight option.\nThe T-GT 2 puts forward a very impressive feature set, boasting up to 1,080 degrees of rotation (which can be altered within the Thrustmaster PC software), ultra-smooth linear force feedback, a three pedal base and a quick-release system. That last one allows you to unlock the wheel from the servo base for use with other supporting bases. Throw in a whopping 25 action buttons and you\u2019ve got plenty of customization options for in-depth sim racers.\nThe wheel, pedals and servo base as one package comes to $799.99 / \u00a3699.99; about as expensive as a PS5 Pro, actually. But we digress; those with the cash to spend will find a superb, long-lasting premium PC racing wheel in the Thrustmaster T-GT 2.\n- Read more: Thrustmaster T-GT 2 racing wheel review\nThe best PC racing wheel for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a fantastic entry-level wheel: It's a few years old now, but the G920 remains a powerhouse in its price bracket thanks to top-notch build quality, superb force feedback and pin-sharp responsiveness.\n\u274c That brake pedal sounds like trouble: Really the only major downside here is the G920's stiff brake pedal. Sensitivity settings in-game can help alleviate the stress of it, but it will take some serious getting used to still.\nWe\u2019ve picked the Logitech G920 as one of the best PC racing wheels largely for its beginner-friendly nature. Like the G923 above, it\u2019s a plug-and-play wheel that isn\u2019t too large, has superb force feedback and actually comes in cheaper (in the US, at least) than its sibling wheel.\nAs we\u2019ve come to expect from the brand, the G920\u2019s build quality is nothing short of superb, with a leatherette-wrapped wheel providing tight grip and comfort which makes it a great pick for endurance racing and the lengthy grand prix events of F1 24.\nThe only outstanding flaw we discovered with the G920 is its awkwardly stiff brake pedal, which we found to be quite irksome during testing. We recommend downloading the G Hub software on PC and whacking brake sensitivity up, which will reflect universally across all supported games.\nThe Logitech G920 is available for $299.99 / \u00a3349.99 / AU$549.95 but it is worth keeping in mind that it\u2019s often subject to some pretty fantastic discount prices over major sales periods. You\u2019re also getting a set of pedals just like the G923, increasing the value proposition exponentially.\n- Read more: Logitech G920 review\nThe best PC racing wheel accessory\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want immersive manual transmission: For a satisfying and tactile gear shifting experience, this is an absolute must-own racing accessory.\n\u274c You're an F1 player: Codemasters' open-wheel sim racers are great, but not particularly well-suited to the TH8S given their use of eight forward gears.\nOne of the best PC racing wheel accessories for us is certainly the Thrustmaster TH8S gear shifter. It does what it says on the tin and provides a more realistic and tactile way to apply manual transmission to your racing sim sessions. And when it comes to setup, things couldn\u2019t be easier; simply clamp it to your desk, hook it up to your PC via USB-C or DIN and you\u2019re ready to go.\nAt $69.99 / \u00a359.99, we also find it to be a very reasonably priced PC racing wheel accessory. That\u2019s doubly so if you\u2019ve already saved cash by opting for a cheaper wheel like the Thrustmaster T128. Given the branding, you may be tempted to pair the TH8S with a Thrustmaster wheel, but as it connects directly to your PC, it\u2019ll work well with any racing wheel.\nWith seven forward gears and one for reverse, the Thrustmaster TH8S is ideal for racers that primarily feature road cars. It\u2019s a superb option for more casual games like Forza Horizon 5 or The Crew Motorfest, as well as simmers like Assetto Corsa Competizione. We find that it\u2019s not best suited for open-wheel racers like F1 24, given those cars\u2019 reliance on eight forward gears.\n- Read more: Thrustmaster TH8S shifter review\nThe best PC racing controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a more novel racing experience: The eSwap XR Pro's bespoke wheel module is an excellent substitute if you're not interested in a full wheel setup.\n\u274c You're on a tighter budget: Much like the entire eSwap range, the eSwap XR Pro is pretty expensive as far as standard controllers go. You may wish to wait for a sale here.\nWhat\u2019s this? A controller in a list of the best PC racing wheels? It\u2019s true; the Thrustmaster eSwap XR Pro is a gamepad, but it has a unique extra up its sleeve that you may want to consider if you\u2019re after a racing wheel-adjacent experience, but don\u2019t have the room for a full setup.\nThe eSwap XR Pro includes a bespoke racing wheel add-on module that can be swapped into the pad in place of a traditional thumb stick (or d-pad module, depending on what you prefer to swap out). It provides full rotation, making it effectively a miniature steering wheel for use with racing games. It\u2019s an excellent addition and is also brilliantly responsive, making it more than just a throwaway gimmick in our books; Thrustmaster really put some effort in here.\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the eSwap lineup, you\u2019ll be glad to know that all the hallmarks of the brand including swappable stick and d-pad modules are also present and accounted for here. That means you can, for example, adopt PlayStation\u2019s symmetrical stick layout if you\u2019d prefer.\nAt $179.99 / \u00a3179.99 / AU$379 it is a premium wired controller; encroaching on the retail price of the Thrustmaster T128. That said, it\u2019s still a worthwhile option if you like the idea of essentially having a controller and a racing wheel packed into one device.\n- Read more: Thrustmaster eSwap XR Pro review\nThe best PC racing wheels FAQs\nWhat PC racing wheel should I buy if I\u2019m just starting out?\nBeginners to the PC racing wheel scene shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to shell out for the best premium pick. In reality, you\u2019ll be well served opting for the Thrustmaster T128 - our best budget option - thanks to an impressive feature set at its relatively lower price point. Those willing to spend a bit more should consider the Logitech G920, however. This PC racing wheel is exceptionally easy to set up; going from box to desk to game potentially in mere minutes.\nIs a PC racing wheel worth it?\nThis will all depend on how often you play PC racing games, as well as which types. For simpler arcade racers, a standard controller can do the job just fine. However, when it comes to more in-depth sim racers, you often miss out by not making use of a more immersive control style. If you frequent the lobbies of Assetto Corsa Competizione or iRacing, then, having a PC racing wheel will exponentially increase your enjoyment of those titles.\nDo all racing wheels work on PC?\nBroadly speaking, yes, most racing wheels on the market are compatible with PC; some are even only compatible with desktop computers. There may be some edge cases here and there with wheels designed exclusively for console use. But really, any racing wheels worth its price will be out-of-the-box compatible with your gaming PC.\nHow we test the best PC racing wheels\nIn testing the best PC racing wheels, accessories or controllers for review, we dig deep into a number of factors to determine whether or not a product is worth your time and cash; let alone whether it should be considered among the best or not. PC racing wheels are typically expensive peripherals, so knowing you\u2019re getting your money\u2019s worth is paramount.\nOn that note, we take a microscope to elements like build quality, ease of setup, versatility and of course, overall performance. We take into account features like force feedback, rotation, ease of setup, customizability and overall responsiveness during racing sessions. Once we\u2019ve analyzed all that, we put those factors up against the price of the PC racing wheel in question to determine overall value for money.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "At Gamescom 2025, I drifted by gaming hardware manufacturer Turtle Beach\u2019s booth and got to try out the upcoming Turtle Beach Racer wheel. Designed primarily for Xbox Series X, Series S, and PC, it\u2019s a racing wheel on the lower end of the mid-range price spectrum, but one that boasts some pretty impressive features.\nWireless racing wheels aren\u2019t something you see hit the market very often, but the Turtle Beach Racer has this as an option. More serious sim racer players may wince at the idea, but it\u2019s abundantly clear that this is not the target audience for the Turtle Beach Racer. Instead, it leans in a more casual-friendly direction, better suited to sim-lite or arcade-like racing games like Dirt 5, Forza Horizon 5, Tokyo Xtreme Racer, and Fortnite\u2019s Rocket Racing mode.\nIt\u2019s a wheel that has an almost refreshingly laid-back feel to it, which is something I was appreciative of as someone who doesn\u2019t have much room at home for a more fulsome wheel setup. And at launch, I can easily see it being one of the best Xbox racing wheels if its wireless connectivity holds up to scrutiny.\nRidge Racer\nThe first thing that stood out to me about the Turtle Beach Racer is its impressive build quality. While primarily plastic, and certainly not premium-feeling by any means, it\u2019s a sight better than what we see typically in its price bracket of $179.99 / \u00a3139.99.\nThe steering wheel itself is great, with a soft texture that feels light and grippy in the hands. I also like the inclusion of extra remappable buttons on the wheel\u2019s dashboard, lending some customizability for actions like gear shifting and the like.\nBut wait, gear shifting? Isn\u2019t that what those rear paddles are for? Actually, no. In something that will undoubtedly turn sim racers away - but might broaden the Racer\u2019s casual appeal - this racing wheel doesn\u2019t ship with a set of pedals. Instead, throttle and braking are assigned by default to those two rear paddles. This is likely a move to keep the Racer\u2019s price relatively stable, and hey, it\u2019s one less chunk of plastic that might end up in landfill years from now.\nIt\u2019s an impressively compact wheel, then, and that\u2019s also supported by the lap rest the Racer comes with. This is an adjustable rest that helps you sit the unit on your lap if you don\u2019t have a dedicated desk or table space. Again, I do find this quite appealing as someone who often struggles with even basic plug-and-play wheel setups without significantly shifting my existing setup around. It\u2019s something I think all budget to mid-range wheels should consider including moving forward.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLook ma, no wires!\nI was also impressed by the responsiveness of its wireless connectivity. I played a demo of Dirt 5 with the Racer, and I didn\u2019t notice any egregious bouts of input latency. Both 2.4Ghz and Bluetooth connections are supported, though I would certainly recommend the former for a more stable connection overall - even for the most arcade-like racers out there.\nTurtle Beach claims the Racer can last up to 30 hours on a single charge, which would be pretty excellent and outclasses many of the best Xbox controllers in terms of battery life. Naturally, this is something we\u2019d need to test for a full review, but if true, it means the Racer\u2019s portability will be that much more impressive.\nThe Turtle Beach Racer is due to launch on September 9, 2025, and will be compatible with Xbox consoles (including Series X|S and Xbox One), PC, and Android mobile devices. There\u2019s no word on a PlayStation model just yet, but if this first product is successful enough, I could see Turtle Beach producing a follow-up or revision for Sony\u2019s console.\nYou might also like...\n- Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is the perfect example of a superhero game done right, and its brilliant action left me desperate for more\n- I could look at Lego Voyagers for hours, but that's not the only reason why this co-op adventure might be the next Split Fiction\n- High on Life 2 could be the perfect sequel, even if you couldn't stand the first one\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "- Thrustmaster has revealed the T248R racing wheel for PS5, PS4, and PC\n- It'll have adjustable force feedback and a customizable LCD display\n- Its included pedals are also powered by the brand's H.E.A.R.T. tech\nGaming hardware manufacturer Thrustmaster has revealed the T248R racing wheel. A successor to the Thrustmaster T248, this new wheel will be compatible with PS5, PS4, and PC.\nPre-orders begin today at Thrustmaster's website, with the wheel costing $349.99 / \u00a3269.99. It'll then release a couple of weeks later on September 17, 2025. That's cheaper than similar mid-range wheels like the Logitech G923 ($399.99 / \u00a3349.99) and the T248 predecessor (which launched at $399.99 / \u00a3299.99).\nPerhaps the standout feature of the Thrustmaster T248R is its adjustable force feedback. Thrustmaster describes these as 'BOOST' levels, with each offering varying degrees of intensity. This could be helpful if you want a smoother experience for circuit racers like Gran Turismo 7, or a bumpier ride for, say, EA Sports WRC.\nAn updated LCD screen is also featured here, and it's where you can adjust the aforementioned force feedback settings, as well as view real-time race info like lap times and current speed. The display also seems to be quite customizable, with Thrustmaster stating it offers 20 bits of display information that presumably can be cycled through.\nThe T248R also comes with a set of pedals; the T-3PM pedal set. These are powered by Thrustmaster's own H.E.A.R.T. Hall effect technology, meaning they'll have a contactless connection that should avoid any uncomfortable drift or wearing down of internal components. Brake resistance can also be adjusted here to your comfort.\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the T248R will land on our best PS5 racing wheels guide, but Thrustmaster has a strong track record when it comes to the best racing wheels. As such, this could be a solid mid-range option that does at least slightly undercut the competition in terms of pricing.\nYou might also like...\n- Hollow Knight: Silksong players on Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to download a free upgrade pack to unlock 'enhanced features'\n- I spent three hours exploring Silent Hill f\u2019s eerie world and only yelped once\u2026 okay, twice\n- The Outer Worlds 2 let me create a sickly, annoying, and profoundly unintelligent hero, and I wouldn't have it any other way\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "Best racing wheels in 2025: our favorite wheels from Thrustmaster, Logitech and more\nThe best racing wheels across consoles and PC\nThe best racing wheels are the most vital component of any dedicated racing sim setup. Whether you're on console or PC, options for racing wheels are plentiful, with brands like Logitech and Thrustmaster leading the charge on accessible plug-and-play racing wheels that are incredibly easy to set up for first-time owners.\nThis guide compiles what we feel are the very best options available today based on our expert testing and review - whether that be one of the best PC racing wheels for a desktop setup, or the best Xbox racing wheels for F1 24 and Forza Horizon 5. And of course, the best PS5 racing wheels are ideal if you're a Gran Turismo 7 fan. That said, most of the big-name racing games offer support for a wide range of wheels, so your favorite title likely won't leave you wanting.\nNo matter your platform of choice, we've endeavored to include a range of top racing wheel choices. We strive to include options that we've tested and reviewed ourselves, so you can rest assured that the best racing wheels in this list have been given the TechRadar Gaming seal of approval. We'll also be updating the guide with products we deem worthy of your time and money finding their way into the list throughout this year and beyond.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nBest overall\nThe Thrustmaster T248 hits a sweet spot between price and performance, making it our pick for best racing wheel overall.\nBest budget\nBest budget\nThe Hori Apex is certainly an older wheel, but it's one of the most affordable and an excellent choice for beginners.\nBest premium\nBest premium\nThe Thrustmaster T-GT 2 is the priciest wheel on our list, but most definitely has the quality to match its price tag.\nBest mid-range\nBest mid-range\nAlso our pick for the best PS5 racing wheel, the Logitech G923 provides a fantastic experience at a competitive price point.\nBest force feedback\nBest force feedback\nThe Thrustmaster T598 is an excellently customizable direct drive wheel that sports exceptionally satisfying and realistic force feedback.\nBest for Xbox\nBest for Xbox\nLooking for a racing wheel fit for Forza? The Logitech G920 is a superb Xbox-first racing wheel that's our top pick for the console.\nBest racing wheels in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest racing wheel overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a full package racing experience: The T248 acts as a fantastic entry-level wheel, and one you won't need to upgrade from unless you're shooting for something premium.\n\u2705 You'd find an on-board display useful: The T248's digital display is more than a novelty. It offers handy telemetry data for the games that support it.\n\u274c You want something a bit quieter: The gear shifting paddles on the T248 are a bit on the loud side, which can be distracting during longer form endurance races.\nOur pick for the best racing wheel overall is a real jack-of-all-trades in terms of performance, design and price: the Thrustmaster T248. This excellent racing wheel boasts top-notch build quality for both the wheel and pedal modules, as well as n impressive range of features for those who like to customize their experience up to quite a granular degree.\nAt $300 / \u00a3300, the Thrustmaster T248 finds itself costing about the same as the Logitech G923 outside of notable sales periods. It's quite an eye-catching price point if you don't quite have the budget for our premium option below - the Thrustmaster T-GT 2 - or you're looking for something more feature rich than a cheaper wheel without breaking the bank too much.\nYou\u2019re also getting high performance here that\u2019s actually fairly close to competing with the very best Logitech wheels. With the Thrustmaster T248, you're getting 900-degree rotation and strong force feedback for an accurate and immersive experience while racing. We view the T248 as a true sweet spot amongst the best racing wheels you can buy, which is why it sits in our spot for the best overall choice if you're looking for a wheel that has a good bit of everything.\nBest budget racing wheel\n2. Hori Apex\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a strict budget: Racing wheels that are worth your cash don't get much cheaper than this, even if it's still in the triple digits.\n\u2705 You play casual or arcade racers: For less sim-heavy racers like Need for Speed Unbound and Hot Wheels Unleashed 2, the Hori Apex is a quality option.\n\u274c You're a sim racer: Avoid the Hori Apex for more complex racing titles like Gran Turismo 7 or Forza Horizon 5.\nThe Hori Apex looks a lot like the other wheels here, but it\u2019s actually rather different. This isn\u2019t a force feedback wheel, relying on rumble instead. Fire up a game like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 24 and more modern Thrustmaster or Logitech wheels will decimate the Hori for quality of experience.\nHowever, the Hori is perfect for arcade racers, some of which only have rumble effects rather than force feedback programmed in anyway. As a result, the Hori is also much lighter than any other wheel here. You\u2019ll still need something to clamp it to, but this is the one wheel here that won\u2019t seem hard done by if it\u2019s not treated to a proper frame or wheel stand.\nClearly made for racers where you\u2019ll use nitrous every 4.5 seconds, it tries harder than the rest to put all the main PS4 buttons at your fingertips; there\u2019s a pair of them right on the wheel rim itself. You can also alter the D-pad to emulate the DualShock 4 or DualSense's own, or either of the analog sticks.\nThat said, the Hori Apex is easily the most toy-like wheel in this group. It has plastic gear shifters, fairly cheap plastic pedals and no parts to upgrade. It also has very limited rotation compared with all the other wheels here, turning just 270 degrees rather than the 900 or 1080 we see with pricier options. There's some compromises here, then, when compared to the pricier wheels. But as a budget buy for more laid back racing titles, it's a decent pick.\n- Stay tuned for our full review of the Hori Apex racing wheel\nBest premium racing wheel\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a Gran Turismo head: The T-GT 2 works across most racing sims, but is natively designed for Gran Turismo 7, making it an excellent choice for Polyphony's PS5 racer.\n\u2705 You want excellent force feedback: The T-GT 2's powerful force feedback register adds layers of immersion to racing sims that you might not have thought possible if you're new to wheels in general.\n\u274c You're looking for an Xbox wheel: Simply put, the Thrustmaster T-GT 2 is not compatible with Xbox consoles. For that, you'll need a model like the Logitech G920.\nWhat makes the Thrustmaster T-GT 2 the easiest to recommend as a premium option goes beyond its superb build quality. Yes, the wheel is built to justify its high asking price, but there's some crucial design decisions that set it apart. It\u2019s not geared, for one, instead using a series of belts powered by brushless motors.\nThis gives it the perfect combo of power and smoothness, for a sense of realism and immersion you can\u2019t really beat at the price. It leads to incredible-feeling force feedback that's among the best you're going to get from a non-direct drive racing wheel. And while the use of a wheel base means it isn't quite as beginner-friendly as a plug-and-play model like the Logitech G923, on the flipside this offers excellent customizability if, say, you want to swap out the T-GT 2 for a different wheel.\nThe elephant in the room is that the Thrustmaster T-GT 2 is incredibly expensive. At $799.99 / \u00a3699.99 it'll be understandably out of reach for most budgets, sitting in a more suitably enthusiast price bracket. If you're still keen on the T-GT 2, then, we'd highly recommend waiting for a discount, as the wheel does often come down in price over key sales periods.\nBest mid-range racing wheel\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want fantastic build quality: The leather stitching looks premium, the steel pedals are strong even under weighty heel-toe and it just doesn\u2019t feel breakable under heavy steering.\n\u2705 You're after an affordable sim ready steering wheel: The G923 features an innovative force feedback system through Trueforce and tactile pedals that won\u2019t cost the world.\n\u274c You're not into sim racing: Arcade or casual racing fans are perhaps better off with a cheaper, no-frills wheel like the Hori Apex.\nAlso our pick for the best PS5 racing wheel, the Logitech G923 looks almost identical to the G920. The wheel still features the same caliber of materials, from the leather stitching to the metal pedals, incredibly sturdy steering, strong force-feedback and logical button layout all return. Set-up is also fairly easy by-way-of power adapter and USB cable, while button placements and macros are customizable through Logitech\u2019s GHub application to a respectable degree. In fact, most of the fundamentals remain the same as the previous Logitech G920.\nIt's still a healthy improvement, though, that makes the Logitech G923 perfect for PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. But it's just as happy with the Xbox One, PS4 or PC. Make sure you buy the right version, though, as the wheel has two separate products that are console-dependant. There's no one-size-fits-all option here.\nThe G923 makes some vital improvements too though. Primarily, the G923 adds Trueforce, a haptics-based system that transmits the feel of the road through your fingers and palms. Logitech has also upgraded the G923's brake, for more progressive resistance on the depress, while the LED rev indicator and 24-Point selection dial from the Playstation 4 version of the G920 become standard for this wheel.\n- Read more: Logitech G923 racing wheel review\nBest force feedback racing wheel\n5. Thrustmaster T598 force feedback racing wheel\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019ve been on the fence about direct drive wheels: The Thrustmaster T598 is as beginner-friendly as it gets when it comes to direct drive wheels.\n\u2705 You want a solid base to upgrade over time: If you end up loving the T598, then great news! The wheel is easily customizable, allowing you to swap out parts or accessories if you get the taste for it.\n\u274c You\u2019re not a tinkerer: Conversely, if you'd just prefer to plug in and get going, you might consider something a bit more straightforward like the Logitech G923.\nThe Thrustmaster T598 isn't just an excellent force feedback wheel, it's a superb entry point overall into the world of direct drive racing wheels. Fairly priced and sporting satisfyingly smooth performance for sim racing, it's your gateway into direct drive if you're willing to make that jump.\nWhat's especially great about the Thrustmaster T598 is how easy it is to customize. It's a wheel you'll want to buy if you're into direct drive and sim racing for the long haul, as its base provides everything you'll need to swap out or add accessories in the years to come.\n- Read more: Thrustmaster T598 review\nBest racing wheel for Xbox\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You play primarily on Xbox: There's not many Xbox-dedicated racing wheels worth writing home about, but the G920 is a superb choice for Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon.\n\u2705 You want quality similar to the G923: While not quite as impressive as the upgraded G923, the G920 comes in cheaper and is designed for Xbox play.\n\u274c You want an easier time braking: You'll likely need to adjust the brake's sensitivity settings as it's incredibly stiff by default.\nThe Logitech G920 is certainly quite similar to prior Logitech wheels like the G29 or the upgraded G923, but the G920 is designed first and foremost with Xbox Series and Xbox One consoles in mind. It's an excellent choice if you're an entry-level wheel for Xbox with excellent build quality and well-rounded force feedback.\nLike it's PS4 counterpart, the G920 is more affordable than Thrustmaster wheels but still boasts great quality. While an overall fantastic wheel with high-quality materials, 900-degree rotation and immersive force feedback, it's got one fatal flaw. The brake pedal is absurdly stiff for an entry-level wheel, meaning it's incredibly difficult to use without slotting the pedal set into a dedicated racing seat or adjusting its sensitivity settings. Still a superb wheel overall, but this is worth taking into consideration.\n- Read more: Logitech G920 racing wheel review\nWhat you need to know\nThe best racing wheels are typically among the most expensive peripherals you can buy for console or PC. Even budget models, like the Hori Apex, can command upwards of $100 / \u00a3100. As a result, racing wheels are usually bought by genre enthusiasts.\nThat being said, the best racing wheels we've highlighted in our list are feature-rich packages. There's usually robust functionality here, with some options featuring sim racing specific buttons to help with everything from gear shifts to pit crew comms. Furthermore, most of the best racing wheels will also come with a set of pedals included, offering a greater sense of immersion and control during gameplay.\nMany of the best racing wheels are also plug-and-play. That's because the wheel comes pre-attached to an included base, meaning they can be hooked up to a console or PC with minimal fuss.\nThere are some racing wheels, such as the Thrustmaster Ferrari 488 GT3, however, that don't come bundled with a base or pedals. In such a case, you'll need to buy these separately. But because these can command high prices, such setups are strictly for the enthusiast crowd. We've endeavored to include more plug-and-play friendly options that are more cost effective, and will save you tons of setup time.\nBest racing wheels - FAQs\nWhat games support the best racing wheels?\nRacing wheels pair the best with games that feature a level of realistic simulation. On PC, this could be Assetto Corsa Competizione and iRacing. And over on console, games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 24 and Gran Turismo 7 support a wide range of contemporary racing wheels, meaning that you don't need to play them with a more traditional controller.\nWhat is the best racing wheel for beginners?\nWhile racing wheel beginners may have their own preferences, if you're just looking to get immediately stuck in with no fuss, then a mid-range plug-and-play wheel like the Logitech G923 or Thrustmaster T248 will be the way to go. While costly, they offer more features and more detailed force feedback compared to cheaper models. They're also widely supported by many of the best racing sims, with existing presets in-game so you can get started straight away.\nWhat is force feedback?\nForce feedback is a standard feature now, and can be found in most of the best racing wheels. Essentially, the feature aims to provide realistic physical feedback based on on-track events. This could register in the wheel rattling when hugging the apex of a tight corner, or shaking after a collision with a rival driver. Force feedback is largely implemented for the sake of immersion, much like a controller's rumble. However, if you find it distracts you from performing during a race, most games offer the option to switch it off or adjust its intensity.\nWhat is the best budget F1 racing wheel?\nRacing wheels can be expensive, but there are options if you're operating on a stricter budget. While still not necessarily cheap, we'd recommend either the Thrustmaster T150 or the Hori Apex as they're fantastic entry-level wheels that, unlike models like the Thrustmaster T300 RS, won't cost the earth.\nHow we test the best racing wheels\nWe test the best racing wheels with a variety of criteria, first and foremost being ease of setup. If, for example, a wheel is fairly plug-and-play, we can recommend it to beginners as it's often as simple as plugging the device into your console (or PC) of choice. Some wheels, meanwhile, will need to be attached to a wheel base that are often sold separately. These can often be quite expensive and thus would only recommend them to enthusiasts or those familiar with this type of peripheral.\nA number of other factors can determine which racing wheels are truly the best. One standout feature here is force feedback, which aims to provide realistic kick and vibration, reacting to in-game sensations such as gripping tight corners, driving over curbs and shifting gears. Force feedback can provide an extra layer of immersion that you simply won't get from a standard controller.\nWe also look at various design elements such as rotation, comfort, drive type and ancillary buttons to determine a racing wheel's overall quality. The very best will offer a high level of comfort during gameplay, and offer a robust set of features suited to games from the most basic arcade racers all the way up to the most immersive sim racing experiences.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

  "argos_summary": "Thrustmaster\u2019s new Ferrari\u2011licensed T98 steering wheel targets children and first\u2011time users with a $100 price tag, offering a realistic look but no force feedback due to cost constraints.
