  "title": "3 HBO Max Shows to Devour This Weekend (September 5 - 7)",
  "description": "3 HBO Max shows you can get through in a single weekend binge.",
  "content": "Many of the greatest TV series of all time\u2014from Oz to The Sopranos to Game of Thrones and beyond\u2014 were born on HBO Max (well, HBO). The renowned premium cable network-turned streaming service is still pumping them out, making it harder than ever to decide what to watch.\n\nIf you're looking for a show that you can get through in a single weekend, I've got three picks that you're bound to love.\n\nWith only a couple of weeks to go before they hand out the hardware at the 77th Emmy Awards, there's still time for you to binge season one of The Penguin, the second-most nominated show of the year, with a whopping 24 nominations. Two of those nods are well-earned by The Batman spinoff's two lead actors: Colin Farrell, who is chillingly unrecognizable as Oswald \"Oz\" Cobb, aka The Pengiun, and the brilliant Cristin Milioti as the deadly and underestimated crime boss, Sofia Falcone. The series is worth watching for their performances alone.\n\nThe story picks up where 2022's film The Batman left off, and follows Oz as his obsessive ambition to climb to the top has him dangerously playing both sides of the city's warring crime families, the Falcones and Maronis. But it's Sofia's ambition that Oz really has to worry about. Fresh out of Arkham Asylum, the traumatized daughter of Carmine is cunning, dangerous, a bit unhinged, and poses a serious threat to Oz's plans.\n\nMilioti chews up every scene she's in, which is no easy feat when sharing the screen with Farrell, who endured a three-hour makeup routine with prosthetics and a full bodysuit to play the iconic DC villain. Shot with a cohesive, darker aesthetic, in line with Matt Reeves' Batman film, The Penguin isn't your daddy's top-hat-and-monacle-wearing comic book Penguin, but a whole new breed.\n\nNoah Wyle's John Carter was by far my favorite ER character (suck it, Clooney). So when I heard that the actor was returning to the world of hospital dramas in The Pitt, and the team behind ER was responsible for its creation to boot, I was in like an intubation tube (I've clearly watched a lot of this stuff).\n\nI love this show on HBO Max because it gets to provide a much more realistic look inside the breakneck, brutal, and often dire world of a busy hospital emergency room than network shows like ER or Grey's Anatomy ever could.\n\nWylie plays Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, the chief attending doctor in the trauma ward of the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, aka The Pitt. Much of the show's realism can be attributed to its 15 one-hour episodes, which take place in real-time over the course of a single, exhausting 15-hour shift in the ER.\n\nSeason one not only introduces us to Robby's veteran team, who perform miracles, but also a group of young residents, some on their first shifts in the ER, who get thrown into chaos when a shooting at a music festival floods the department with victims. It's bloody, intense, emotional, and produced with such attention to detail that you'll be left exhausted and in awe of them and the real-life medical professionals who do this every day.\n\nIt may not be the most cheerful show to binge over the course of a weekend, but I guarantee that you won't be able to tear yourself away from HBO's acclaimed five-part miniseries Chernobyl\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Created by The Last of Us writer/creator Craig Mazin, the haunting series is a dramatic depiction of the worst nuclear disaster in human history, the meltdown of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Soviet Ukraine in 1986. The show opens by taking viewers inside the plant on the night of the event.\n\nThe disaster unleashed tons of nuclear radiation into the atmosphere, a fact that Soviet chemist Valery Legasov (Jared Harris) puts into perspective to Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telling him that \"It\u2019s giving out the equivalent radiation of two Hiroshima bombs every hour!\"\n\nHarris' performance is chilling to the bone as Legasov, the man charged with handling the travesty, navigates Soviet propaganda, politics, and the gruesome effects the radiation is having on the citizens of the nearby town of Pripyat. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd also stars as Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shcherbina, who butts heads with Legasov as the man in charge of the government's response to the disaster.\n\nWhen the show aired in 2019, it was acclaimed for its stark realism and performances, but it was also controversial, prompting conversations and even arguments about its portrayal of Soviet Russia, socialism, and even the realities of nuclear physics. Chernobyl is a must-watch series if you're at all interested in dramatizations of major historical events. It's a good thing that it's just five episodes, because it's an intense, but worthwhile, ride.\n\nHBO Max is the home of some of the best TV series of all time. And even if you don't go for any of the streamer's most recent shows, like The Last of Us, Peacemaker, or The White Lotus, this well runs so deep that you're not likely to run out of older things to watch.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nHBO is synonymous with top-tier original entertainment. Its streaming service, HBO Max, offers the best of the best. Skipping obvious hits like The Wire, Watchmen, and Game of Thrones, here are the best original HBO shows, new and old.\nBoardwalk Empire\nCreator Terence Winter worked as a writer on The Sopranos, and Boardwalk Empire has a similar gritty, grounded take on flawed mobsters. It's also set in New Jersey, focused on organized crime in Atlantic City during Prohibition, when the city was a haven for illegal gambling and alcohol.\nSteve Buscemi stars as local politician and mob boss Nucky Thompson, whose rule over the city is ruthless but fragile. The cast also includes Michael Shannon, Kelly Macdonald, Shea Whigham, and Michael K. Williams, among others, making up a stellar ensemble of fascinating underworld characters.\nBored to Death\nJason Schwartzman stars in Bored to Death as a writer and Brooklyn hipster who decides to become a private detective despite his lack of experience or skills (or a license). Mostly a hangout comedy co-starring Zach Galifianakis and Ted Danson as the main character's friends and reluctant assistants, Bored to Death captures a specific 2010s Brooklyn vibe, poised between literary pretension and stoner goofiness.\nIt's as much about goofy man-children bumbling toward maturity as it is about solving actual mysteries, even if they eventually manage to do that, too.\nThe Deuce\nLongtime HBO contributor David Simon is best known as the creator of The Wire, but he's produced quite a few other serious examinations of urban subcultures. The Deuce takes on the adult industry of New York City's Times Square in the 1970s and '80s with thoughtfulness and a wide cross-section of characters. Led by James Franco as twin entrepreneurs (one industrious, the other impulsive) and Maggie Gyllenhaal as a prostitute turned porn auteur, The Deuce finds nuance in a world many dismiss as sleazy and distasteful.\nFamily Tree\nFans of Christopher Guest's mockumentary movies like Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show should seek out Family Tree, an under-the-radar one-season comedy series co-created and directed by Guest. Presented in Guest's familiar improvised faux-doc style, Family Tree follows a middle-aged man played by Chris O'Dowd as he explores his heritage and extended family, meeting all sorts of oddball characters along the way. Guest regulars included Ed Begley Jr., Michael McKean, and Fred Willard make appearances in the funny and surprisingly poignant series.\nInsecure\nStar and co-creator Issa Rae catapulted from a beloved web series to mainstream success with her semi-autobiographical dramedy Insecure. Rae plays Issa, a young single woman in LA balancing her career ambitions and her love life, both of which she's unsure and, yes, insecure about. Rae captures the rhythms of life in LA's Black community, as Issa and her best friend Molly (Yvonne Orji) find their comfort zones between their familiar community and the often white-dominated corporate world.\nPerry Mason\nA reboot of the classic legal drama starring Raymond Burr as the title character, this new version of Perry Mason provides an origin story for the freakishly competent defense attorney. Matthew Rhys plays Perry as a rumpled, melancholy private detective in 1930s Los Angeles, whose investigative work eventually leads to his practicing law. The series retains the moral righteousness of the original while allowing for more nuanced character development and a look into the seedier side of Depression-era Southern California.\nRaised by Wolves\nRidley Scott executive produces sci-fi series Raised by Wolves, and it's easy to see echoes of his well-known sci-fi movies, especially Alien and Prometheus. A pair of androids attempt to raise human children on a harsh, distant planet, while locked in battle with a faction of human religious zealots from Earth.\nAmanda Collin gives a chilling performance as the deadly but nurturing android known as Mother, and the unforgiving environment emphasizes the characters' bleak prospects. The show is both contemplative and suspenseful, much like Scott's best sci-fi movies.\nStarstruck\nNew Zealand comedian Rose Matafeo co-created and stars in the charming romantic comedy Starstruck. She plays Jessie, an aimless London singleton working odd jobs and trying to find direction in her life.\nWhen she unexpectedly has a one-night stand with famous actor Tom Kapoor (Nikesh Patel), she finds herself in a potential romantic relationship with the last person she'd imagine. Jessie and Tom navigate their feelings for each other as they both figure out their future plans.\nFlight of the Conchords\nPart musical, part sketch comedy, part story of two folk musicians from New Zealand trying to make it in New York City, the Emmy-winning Flight of the Conchords is a two-season comedy that ran from 2007 to 2009. It chronicles the miserably wonderful adventures of fictionalized versions of the real-life Conchords, played by real-life Kiwis, Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie.\nBecause there are no plans for a Conchords tour any time soon, make sure you don't miss their 2018 reunion show on HBO Max, Flight of the Conchords: Live in London.\nBarry\nAn award-winning dark comedy starring Bill Hader, Barry tells the story of a modern hitman who becomes disenchanted with his current profession when he discovers a new love for acting. Hader himself was the first to doubt his ability the play a former Marine, but his performance and the fantastic writing behind the show blend comedic genius with poignant intimate moments.\nIn terms of original content alone, you might find HBO Max to be well worth the price tag of $14.99 a month, especially if you want to binge all the good stuff now and then rotate your subscription."

      "text": "Medical dramas such as the Emmy-nominated The Pitt are making just as many waves this year as crime dramas are, and I, for one, have been loving it. Over the years, medical shows have seen a big shift from mere procedurals to shows with more realistic and often-controversial perspectives, compelling fictional characters, and unique spins, including comedies!\nI've watched pretty much every new medical show of the past year, and here are seven of my favorites across several streaming services.\n7 Berlin ER\n|\nRelease Date |\nFebruary 26, 2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nEpisodes |\n8 |\n|\nStarring |\nHaley Louise Jones, Slavko Popadic, Aram Tafreshian |\n|\nStatus |\nUnconfirmed |\nAfter facing personal and professional turmoil in Munich, Dr. Parker (Haley Louise Jones) seeks a fresh start in Berlin. This Apple TV+ German-language series follows the talented but troubled doctor as she\u2019s thrust into the chaotic environment of one of the busiest, most overcrowded emergency rooms in the city, where she faces intense cases, resistant colleagues, and her own inner demons.\nBerlin ER is a graphic medical drama with an unsettling narrative arc that\u2019s both engaging and endearing. Its revelation of realistic medical chaos helps draw attention to the interplay between a relentless pace and methodical control while mirroring the dysfunction within the hospital.\nDon\u2019t be deterred because it\u2019s in German.

It was also HBO Max\u2019s most-watched original title globally, and has been nominated for 13 Primetime Emmys.\nThe Pitt provides a realistic look at the functioning of an emergency room and the doctors and nurses who pull off incredible feats there, as well as the hospital administrators who run it.

The place is severely underfunded and understaffed\u2014a common occurrence.\nAs Robby leads his staff through a shift from hell, he\u2019s also battling his own secret trauma and post-traumatic stress from the loss of his mentor during the insanity of the COVID pandemic. It\u2019s impressive to see him on the verge of a nervous breakdown, keeping it together to do what he\u2019s best at: saving lives.\nIntense, emotional, fast-paced, and extremely well-written and performed, The Pitt makes you forget you\u2019re watching a scripted work of fiction.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $10/month\n- Simultaneous streams\n- 2 or 4\nDon't miss the full first season of Max's most-watched original series, The Pitt.\n2 The Trauma Code: Heroes On Call\n|\nRelease Date |\nJanuary 24, 2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nEpisodes |\n8 |\n|\nStarring |\nJu Ji-hoon, Jung Jae-kwang, Ha Young, Choo Young Woo |\n|\nStatus |\nUnconfirmed |\nThere\u2019s something to be said about foreign medical dramas: They know how to bring the tension and trauma.\nKorea has few skilled trauma surgeons and even fewer who do risky, rebellious things like ride a motorcycle into an active war zone to deliver a backpack full of blood and supplies to those in need. Enter war-seasoned surgeon and trauma god Baek Kang-hyeok (Ju Ji-hoon).\nThe Trauma Code: Heroes On Call follows Kang-hyeok as he\u2019s hired to fix a struggling trauma unit inside a major university hospital. He isn\u2019t well-received, due to his blunt attitude and unconventional methods, but that\u2019s expected, given that most of the doctors at Hankuk National University have had little to no trauma training\u2014horrifying, I know.\nThe series highlights the necessity of quick, effective trauma care and features realistic cases, including those involving severe injuries and critical situations, while exploring the tension between the team\u2019s desire to save lives and the hospital\u2019s financial priorities.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $8/month\n- Simultaneous streams\n- Two or four\nThe Trauma Code: Heroes On Call's eight fast-paced episodes will leave you wanting more of this intense Korean medical drama.\n1 Watson\n|\nRelease Date |\nJanuary 26, 2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nEpisodes |\n13 |\n|\nStarring |\nMorris Chestnut, Randall Park, Eve Harlow, Peter Mark Kendall |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nMorris Chestnut stars as Dr. John Watson\u2014yes, that Watson.
