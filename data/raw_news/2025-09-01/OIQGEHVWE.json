  "title": "Why Some In College Mental Health View 2030 As The End OF The Pandemic",
  "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared over, but some experts believe that the ripple effects in higher education won't settle until the class of 2030 graduates.",
  "content": "On May 5, 2023, The United Nation News reported that the global health emergency of COVID-19 was declared over. The ripple effects from the pandemic did not cease with this declaration, and the impact of COVID-19 reverberated throughout college mental health. A 2024 study in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science conducted a review of 32 studies on college mental health during the pandemic, and found increases in anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and other mental health concerns.\n\nResearchers are now suggesting a gradual decline in mental health symptoms among college students. For example, the 2024 Health Minds Study, which included over 100,000 college students from across 200 universities, suggested nationwide decreases in anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide. Despite these decreases, some experts believe that the ripple effects of COVID-19 in higher education will not settle until the class of 2030 graduates. This is because many students in the incoming classes of 2028, 2029, and 2030 were in the formative years of early-stage adolescence during the pandemic.\n\nPossible Impacts Of The Pandemic On The Class Of 2028\n\nA 2024 report on Forbes.com detailed how the class of 2028 holds shifting worldviews and a familiarity with change because of the pandemic. Many students in this cohort were in the last year of middle school when the pandemic hit, experienced stressful transitions during the initial phases of the shutdown, and then started a new high school, all within six months. Because these students experienced unprecedented amounts of change during their formative years, there\u2019s concern about how this familiarity to change might impact university outcomes.\n\nA 2025 report by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center indicated that the transfer rate of college students to new institutions grew by 4.4% in fall 2024. This was the first semester for the class of 2028, meaning that it\u2019s possible that being familiar with change contributed to some students transferring schools. How students view change is an important consideration for mental health professionals. Being averse to change, or using change to cope with normative stressors, can have a significant impact on wellbeing.\n\nPossible Impacts Of The Pandemic On The Class Of 2029\n\nMany in the class of 2029 were in seventh grade when the pandemic hit. These students might have been more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic as compared to both high schoolers and elementary students. Compared to high schoolers, many middle schoolers endured the pandemic with less emotional maturity and developed identities, shorter attention spans, and being less comfortable with technology. Compared to elementary students, middle schoolers generally experienced more academic demands, higher emotional volatility, and suffered more losses regarding developmental/social milestones.\n\nA 2020 report on NPR.org described concerns from a pediatrician about the effects of the pandemic on middle schoolers. Another factor of consideration is the relationship between middle schoolers and their parents during the pandemic. A 2021 report by the United Stated Census Bureau indicated significant increases in homeschooling during the pandemic, and many parents spent more time at home because of the economic shutdown.\n\nThe increased amount of time that parents generally had with their middle schoolers during the pandemic might contribute to some parents being helicopter/snowplowing parents as these students enter college. Thus, there\u2019s concern that families of the class of 2029 might demand more and place unrealistic expectations on schools. There\u2019s also concern some of these parents could be overcontrolling toward students. A 2025 report on Forbes.com discussed the detrimental effects that overcontrolling parents can have.\n\nPossible Impacts Of The Pandemic On The Class Of 2030\n\nMany students in the class of 2030 started middle school when the pandemic hit. As a group, they experienced similar dynamics as students who are now in the classes of 2028 and 2029; however, the class of 2030 had more normative experiences prior to starting college. For example, many of these students enjoyed traditional years throughout high school.\n\nSpecific schools and communities varied greatly in how they were impacted by COVID-19, and some students who were in elementary schools when the pandemic hit will carry lingering effects into college. However, the middle school years are unique in the developmental life span, so it\u2019s important to consider how experiencing the pandemic during these years might impact the wellbeing of current learners.",

The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center\u2019s fall 2024 Transfer Enrollment and Pathways report reveals that transfer enrollment, which comprises 13% of non-freshmen undergraduates, grew for the third straight year.\nThe ability to transfer between institutions provides students with greater flexibility in their postsecondary educational pathways. The Transfer Enrollment and Pathways report, which replaces the previous Transfer and Progress report series, finds that college transfer enrollment is now 7.9% greater than in the fall of 2020.\n\u201cThe growth in transfers this fall is a further indication that students are adjusting postsecondary goals in response to changing education and labor market conditions,\u201d said Doug Shapiro, Executive Director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. \u201cThat\u2019s good news, especially for those who are able to return from stopouts by finding colleges that better meet their needs.\u201d\nNearly 500,000 students transferred from a two-year to a four-year institution this past fall, a number that is now comparable to fall 2020 (-2,300, -0.5%). Although this remains the most common pathway for transfer students, the share of all transfer students that move from a two-year to a four-year institution declined 3.5 percentage points from fall 2020 to fall 2024.\nAdditional report highlights include:\nCommunity College Transfer Enrollment: This past fall, 390,000 students transferred into a community college, an increase of 13.5% from the fall of 2020. However, total community college enrollment still has not recovered from pandemic declines (-52,300, -1.5% from fall 2020).\nContinuing Transfer Students: The fall of 2024 saw the second straight year of enrollment growth for continuing transfer students \u2014 those who were enrolled at a different institution in the spring or summer term immediately prior.\nView the complete Transfer Enrollment and Pathways report.\n\u201cThe growth in transfers this fall is a further indication that students are adjusting postsecondary goals in response to changing education and labor market conditions.

      "text": "Pediatrician Discusses Pandemic's Effects On Middle Schoolers\nPediatrician Discusses Pandemic's Effects On Middle Schoolers\nNPR's Michel Martin speaks with pediatrician Cara Natterson about how the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 and our response to it \u2014 is affecting kids in a key developmental age group: middle school.\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nWe're going to switch gears to talk once again about how the current health and economic crisis is affecting students. And you've probably seen a story or two about adorable little ones making gratitude signs for first responders. And you've probably heard about high school and college seniors graduating without cherished rituals like prom or spring getaways. But what about all the kids in between?\nMiddle school students are usually between the ages of 11 and 14, roughly, and kids go through some pretty important social and physical changes during that time, so we were wondering, how does a global pandemic, particularly social distancing, affect kids during this important time?\nOur next guest, Dr. Cara Natterson, is a pediatrician who's spent a good part of her career guiding parents through one of the trickiest times in a child's life, adolescence and puberty, which usually begins in middle school. Her books include \"The Care And Keeping Of You\" and, most recently, \"Decoding Boys.\" And she's here once again to share her thoughts.\nDr. Natterson, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again.\nCARA NATTERSON: Thank you.\nMARTIN: Well, as we mentioned, middle school - that's generally sixth, seventh and eighth grades - is a time when lots of kids are going through social and physical changes. And so, you know, look - in the best of times - right? - it can be a pretty fraught time - confusing. I was wondering what you - what are your thoughts about the - all the steps that have been taken to address this globally, particularly social distancing? How might someone in this age group be experiencing this in their own kind of way?\nNATTERSON: I think that the biggest piece to this for the middle schoolers is that they, just like their high school counterparts, are starting to break away from their parents. In middle school, what happens is that you have a shift from thinking that your parents are kind of the be-all and end-all, or at least weighing their opinions and their advice most heavily - you shift from that to thinking your friends, your peer group, is the be-all and end-all, and their impressions and ideas and opinions matter more than anything.\nWell, that shift is very palpable in social settings and in school. It's really different when you're talking about having that developmental shift and only interacting virtually.\nMARTIN: Well, what have you - what are you hearing? I know that you're not practicing at the moment. You're consulting. But I'm sure you're still hearing from parents. What are you hearing from parents of middle schoolers during this time about how their kids are coping? And if you're hearing from any kids directly, what are you hearing?\nNATTERSON: I'm hearing - particularly from the girls, who are generally a little bit more articulate or verbal about how they feel - I'm hearing that they're frustrated because the only way they can interact with their friends is either through video chat, through social media or in person with physical distance between them.\nAnd everything's closed. The restaurants are closed. The shops are closed. The malls are closed. So nothing's happening. So there's nothing to talk about. So the things that they would bond over aren't happening, and then there's no fodder for the conversation. So this is tricky. It feels very isolating. And the thing about being in middle school is you don't realize you feel isolated, or if you do, it's hard to articulate.\nMARTIN: Do you worry that there might be some developmental impact for kids not being able to interact with each other in the way that they are accustomed to? I mean, even as much as we've all kind of come to recognize how terrible it is to be that age and how painful it can be, do you ever worry that there might be some developmental impact to kids not being able to go through these things together in the way that they have become accustomed to?\nNATTERSON: I think we're in the middle of the biggest science experiment in the world. I wish I was getting a PhD right now because there'd be a thousand things I could study and look at from this point forward over the next several years as we work through pandemic and then get past pandemic. No one knows what the developmental impact of this pandemic will be because it's so new.\nBut we can postulate. And I think there will be significant negatives, and I think there will be things that we need to then identify and remedy for our kids going forward because during this moment of trying to pull away from parents and pull towards peers, we have basically said, you can't.\nMARTIN: So before we let you go, what - do you have some just sort of general thoughts about how parents can be thinking about these next couple of months with their kids?\nNATTERSON: Middle schoolers - they're not infants. They're hungry for education and information. They want to understand why you are making the decisions you are making or setting the rules you are setting. And frankly, this is - this preceded pandemic, OK? We should be approaching parenting middle schoolers this way whether or not coronavirus is involved.\nWhen we set a rule for our kids, if we educate them as to why, talk to them, engage them in conversation, share articles with them, watch videos with them, they can begin to understand the rationale for our decision-making. What do we think is going to keep them safe and healthy? So I encourage parents because every family's going to do this slightly differently. Talk to your kids. Ask them what they're thinking and feeling. Tell them why you think they should or shouldn't do certain things.\nThat's how you can have this back-and-forth in parenting. It will open up the lines of conversation. And especially if you have a quiet child, especially if you have a boy who has retreated into himself, you will find that those conversations help bridge that gap and bring your child kind of out of their rooms, out behind the screen, out behind the closed doors and into the fold of making a difference, not just in your family but in the whole world.\nMARTIN: That's Dr. Cara Natterson. She's a pediatrician and an author, most recently of \"Decoding Boys: New Science Behind The Subtle Art Of Raising Sons.\"\nDr. Natterson, thanks so much for talking to us once again.\nNATTERSON: Thank you.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

      "text": "Homeschooling is a legal instructional option in all 50 states and national homeschooling rates grew rapidly from 1999 to 2012 but had since remained steady at around 3.3%.\nHowever, the global COVID-19 pandemic has sparked new interest in homeschooling and the appeal of alternative school arrangements has suddenly exploded.\nSo, how significantly have homeschooling rates increased during the pandemic?\nIt\u2019s clear that in an unprecedented environment, families are seeking solutions that will reliably meet their health and safety needs, their childcare needs and the learning and socio-emotional needs of their children.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s experimental Household Pulse Survey, the first data source to offer both a national and state-level look at the impact of COVID-19 on homeschooling rates, shows a substantial increase from last spring \u2014 when the pandemic took hold \u2014 to the start of the 2020-2021 school year.\nUsing a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. households, the survey shows homeschooling is notably higher than the national benchmarks and offers a glimpse of changes in homeschooling patterns during the pandemic.\nWe compare survey results from the spring of the 2019-20 school year to results in the fall of the 2020-21 school year to measure the pandemic's impact on homeschooling.\nIn the first week (April 23-May 5) of Phase 1 of the Household Pulse Survey, about 5.4% of U.S. households with school-aged children reported homeschooling .\nBy fall, 11.1% of households with school-age children reported homeschooling (Sept. 30-Oct. 12). A clarification was added to the school enrollment question to make sure households were reporting true homeschooling rather than virtual learning through a public or private school.\nThat change represents an increase of 5.6 percentage points and a doubling of U.S. households that were homeschooling at the start of the 2020-2021 school year compared to the prior year.\nIt\u2019s clear that in an unprecedented environment, families are seeking solutions that will reliably meet their health and safety needs, their childcare needs and the learning and socio-emotional needs of their children.\nFrom the much-discussed \u201cpandemic pods,\u201d (small groups of students gathering outside a formal school setting for in-person instruction) to a reported influx of parent inquiries about stand-alone virtual schools, private schools and homeschooling organizations, American parents are increasingly open to options beyond the neighborhood school.\nHomeschooling rates are increasing across race groups and ethnicities.\nIn households where respondents identified as Black or African American (Table 1), the proportion homeschooling increased by five times, from 3.3% (April 23-May 5) to 16.1% in the fall (Sept. 30-Oct. 12). The size of the increases for the other Race/Hispanic origin groups were not statistically different from one another.\nSome U.S. states had much larger increases in homeschooling rates for the 2020-2021 school year than others.\nMassachusetts, for example, jumped from 1.5% to 12.1% while many other states did not show a significant change.\nPossible contributing factors include local homeschooling variation that predated the pandemic, local rates of coronavirus infections, and local decisions about how school is being conducted during the pandemic.\nHomeschooling rates vary among metropolitan areas, as well (Table 3).\nAmong the 15 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), for example, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH MSA, went from 0.9% in the spring of 2020 to 8.9% by the fall.\nIn contrast, the rate in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA, MSA was not significantly different (4.2% and 5.2%) for the same period.\nAdditionally, the rates are likely affected by local rates of coronavirus infections and local public school decisions about modes of instruction.\nThe Household Pulse Survey is designed to provide near-real-time information about the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on American households.\nEducation is one of many topics covered by the survey and the data are not designed to provide a highly detailed look at the many different types of educational arrangements and innovations pursued by households in this unusual school year.\nCasey Eggleston is a research mathematical statistician in the Census Bureau\u2019s Center for Behavioral Science Measurement.\nJason Fields is the senior researcher for Demographic Programs and the Survey of Income and Program Participation in the Census Bureau\u2019s Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division.\n2020 Census Demographic Data Map Viewer is a web map application that includes state-, county-, and census tract-level data from the 2020 Census.\nView training resources for 2020 Census data.\nOur email newsletter is sent out on the day we publish a story.

      "text": "The Class of 2028 has been described by Inside Higher Ed as another college cohort disadvantaged by the global pandemic, economic shutdown, and the societal unrest that marked the early 2020s. There are causes for concerns, such as historically low ACT scores, lack of study skills, and classroom participation. These factors have renewed discussions about institutional readiness among national organizations, such as the American Council on Education\u2019s Learner Success Lab. These questions of readiness are not merely academic, and the Class of 2028 has unique developmental characteristics. For example, it\u2019s the first college cohort that was in early-stage adolescence as middle schoolers during the pandemic. It\u2019s also the last cohort before the demographic cliff begins, in which the college-aged population is expected to shrink by 15% over the next 10 years, a Chronicle of Higher Education report explains.\nBecause of these characteristics, innovative ways to engage and support students are needed. Inside Higher Ed published reports on the impact of college on students and found that traditional benchmarks, such as admissions selectivity, student-faculty ratio, or financial resources, might have less of an impact than the quality of interactions on campuses. Furthermore, there\u2019s a greater emphasis among university administrators on retention and protecting the value of seeking a college degree. To engage and support the Class of 2028, schools need to address the following:\nShifting Worldviews\nEarly adolescence is formative for identity development and middle school years are when implicit theories about the self, others, and the world crystalize. Research published by the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research indicate that implicit theories affected how older individuals reacted to the global pandemic. However, for the Class of 2028, the global pandemic affected the development of their implicit theories. This class is arguably without a frame of reference about a time before the culture wars and worldwide conflicts existed, and their first year of college is alongside divisive moments in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Negative and fixed worldviews, such as \u201ca hostile world,\u201d are associated with the increased tension with free speech, cancel culture, and student misconduct cases on campuses. Thus, educating students about positive worldviews should be a primary goal for schools. Not only will this benefit campuses, but society can benefit because higher education can improve these generational perspectives better than any other experience.\nSchools can improve a student\u2019s worldview by providing opportunities for reflection, generating positive interactions with diverse peers, training faculty and staff members on how to relate to this new generation, and fostering optimistic messages about community and conflict resolution. It\u2019s not a matter of simply being optimistic (some might argue that the world is hostile), but rather giving the Class of 2028 a new frame of reference and instilling the belief that they can make the world a better place.\nFamiliarity With Change\nThe Class of 2028 is more familiar with life-altering change than previous cohorts. The economic shutdown and school disruptions occurred while they were in middle school, and many members of this class then transitioned to a new high school soon afterwards. This familiarity with change, and being less averse to change, can significantly impact university outcomes. For example, transfer students now make up about 13% of college students according to the National Student Clearinghouse Center. Time will tell if the Class of 2028 will transfer schools more than previous cohorts, but schools should brace for this possibility with innovative ways to retain and recruit students.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nThe pending demographic shift also creates urgency for schools to become net receivers of college-going students, which are schools who gain students as the population shifts. Providing high levels of student support is a defining characteristic of net receivers; however, this support is more than financial. As reported by Inside Higher Ed, surveys show that students are still reporting that emotional stress and mental health are the greatest challenges in their educational pursuits. In supporting the Class of 2028, it\u2019s imperative that schools emphasize both general support for developmental concerns (such as adjusting to college and loneliness), as well as counseling services to address clinical issues (such as depression and anxiety). Excelling in both types of support can attract and keep students on campus.\nIn addition, there\u2019s a general decline in college enrollment amid public doubts regarding the value of a college degree. This decline is not surprising given the amount of change/disruption in the educational system that recent learning cohorts have experienced. However, it\u2019s important to note that five of the top-rated reasons by Inside Higher Ed for getting a college degree are outside the realm of money and a career, such as \u201cpreparing myself for life.\u201d Furthermore, the majority of high school students and non-enrolled individuals still report seeing value in pursuing a degree. Schools can reaffirm this value by creating supportive and meaningful environments.\nThe Class of 2028 experienced generational stressors at a unique time in their lifespan development. However, with every incoming cohort, there is excitement and opportunities. Higher education can reset generational views about the world while creating learning environments that foster holistic support and robust clinical services. These are longstanding goals for many higher education professionals, but with the start of this new generation of students, it\u2019s imperative that schools consider how distinct this incoming class really is."

      "text": "WHO chief declares end to COVID-19 as a global health emergency\nThe head of the UN World Health Organization (WHO) has declared \u201cwith great hope\u201d an end to COVID-19 as a public health emergency, stressing that it does not mean the disease is no longer a global threat.\n\u201cLast week, COVID-19 claimed a life every three minutes \u2013 and that\u2019s just the deaths we know about\u201d, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, briefing the media at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Geneva.\nAccording to WHO\u2019s Coronavirus Dashboard which has collated key statistics since early in the pandemic, the cumulative cases worldwide now stand at 765,222,932, with nearly seven million deaths: the precise figure currently stands at 6,921,614.\nAs of 30 April, a total of more than 13.3 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide.\n\u2018Still killing, still changing\u2019\nHe said the virus \u2013 first made a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO chief on 30 January, 2020 - was here to stay: \u201cIt is still killing and it is still changing. The risk remains of new variants emerging that cause new surges in cases and deaths.\u201d\nHe said that the decision had not been made lightly. For the past year, the WHO-led Emergency Committee had been carefully examining the data, on the right time to lower the alarm.\nFor over 12 months, the pandemic \u201chas been on a downward trend\u201d, he said, with immunity increasing due to the highly effective vaccines developed in record time to fight the disease, and infections. Death rates have decreased and the pressure on once overwhelmed health systems, has eased.\n\u201cThis trend has allowed most countries to return to life as we knew it before COVID-19\u201d, Tedros added.\n\u2018Torrent of mis- and disinformation\u2019\nBut he reflected that the impact of the pandemic had \u201cexposed political fault lines, within and between nations. It has eroded trust between people, governments and institutions, fuelled by a torrent of mis- and disinformation.\u201d\nCoronavirus Portal & News Updates\nReaders can find information and guidance on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from the UN, World Health Organization and UN agencies here. For daily news updates from UN News, click here.Tedros also noted the enormous damage inflicted on all aspects of global life by the virus, including enormous economic upheaval, \u201cerasing trillions from GDP, disrupting travel and trade, shuttering businesses, and plunging millions into poverty.\u201d\nHe reminded that as he was speaking, thousands around the world continue to fight for their lives in intensive care, and millions more, will live for the foreseeable future, \u201cwith the debilitating effects\u201d of post-COVID conditions, or so-called \u201clong COVID\u201d.\nThe WHO chief said that at one level, the end of the emergency was a moment to celebrate, and he paid tribute to the \u201cincredible skill and selfless dedication of health and care workers\u201d worldwide.\nReflecting on the \u2018deep scars\u2019\nBut at another level, it was a time for deep reflection, with COVID continuing to leave \u201cdeep scars on our world.\u201d\n\u201cThese scars must serve as a permanent reminder of the potential for new viruses to emerge, with devastating consequences\u201d, he said.\nLearn from mistakes\nMany mistakes were made, including a lack of coordination, equity and solidarity, which meant that existing tools and technologies were not best used to combat the virus.\n\u201cWe must promise ourselves and our children and grandchildren, that we will never make those mistakes again\u201d, he said.\n\u201cThis experience must change us all for the better. It must make us more determined to fulfil the vision that nations had when they founded the WHO in 1948: the highest possible standard of health, for all people.\u201d"

      "text": "Starting college is often an important transition within the relationships between students and their parents. A 2024 report on Forbes.com discussed three ways that parents can have unique impacts on college students and highlighted how supportive parents can help students reduce stress and burnout. However, some students present to campus counseling centers and report stressful relationships with their parents. Common examples of these stressful relationships are \u201chelicopter parents.\u201d According to a 2007 report by Boston University, the term helicopter parent emerged as the baby boomer generation had more money and time to spend on their children than previous generations. This resulted in a tendency to be highly active as parents of college students, which included some parents micromanaging their students.\nAs members of Gen X and Millennials became parents, the general trend of having more money and time for children continued, resulting in elaborations of the concept of helicopter parenting. For example, a 2023 report on Parents.com summarized the potential harmful effects of \u201csnowplow parenting,\u201d which describes a tendency of some parents to remove all stressors or challenges that their children might experience. Regardless of the term used to describe these behaviors, or the reasons why these behaviors exist, having parents who are over controlling can have detrimental impacts on students.\nOver Controlling Parents Can Hinder Development And Opportunities\nThe traditional college-aged years are formative for the development of personal values. Instead of specific rules, such as who a child can spend time with outside of school, what time is curfew, and when to do homework, college is a place to establish values such as lifestyle choices, personal development, and academic performance. According to a 2025 study in the journal of Brain Sciences, the establishment of personal values is associated with individual decision-making. Thus, over controlling rules which limit students\u2019 ability to make decisions can hinder the development of long-term values. Furthermore, many colleges and universities have thousands of students on campus. If a student enters the campus community with a set of rules that are more strict than other students, then it\u2019s expected that the student will miss opportunities, such as attending certain social events that could result in having more friends, participating in extracurricular activities that could lead to future internships, or attending campus events that could result in being more excited about college.\nOver Controlling Parents Often Have Limited Influence\nAs detailed in the report on Forbes.com, parents generally have significant influence over college students. This influence is mostly experienced by students as parents being positive role models and giving practical advice; however, such influence can last a lifetime. On the contrary, over controlling rules can influence the behavior of college students, but this type of influence is time limited. As students proceed through their academic careers, most of them will obtain financial independence, and this independence will minimize the impact of any parental rules.\nA 2020 study in the journal of Psychological Reports found that parent-child attachment can also impact the social relationships of college students, including factors such as social anxiety. Consistent with these findings is the fact that many students with over controlling parents attempt to put rules and expectations on peers. This usually has limited influence on peers and can result in these students being rejected by others. In turn, many of these students will start resisting or rejecting their parents, which could produce a vicious cycle of attachment problems and difficulty connecting with others.\nOver Controlling Parents Often Reap What They Sow\nAccording to a 2025 report on HealtyRelationshipsInitiative.org, rules often represent boundaries to children. As such, over controlling rules to college students often represent an over reliance of boundaries during a time of independence. It\u2019s often beneficial for parents to ponder that college students eventually reach a point in lifespan development in which they put boundaries on their parents. Examples include relocating after graduation, getting married, and starting a family. The boundaries that students place on parents later in life often reflect their feelings about the boundaries that parents once placed on them.\nIn closing, it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s no consensus on what constitutes an over controlling parent. Furthermore, students need rules while in college, and some students need more rules than others. However, it\u2019s usually obvious when a student is burdened with rules that are excessive and don\u2019t match the general experience of being in college. Most parents want their children to succeed in college, and they can help foster student success by setting appropriate and normative expectations."

  "argos_summary": "The article reviews the lingering mental\u2011health effects of COVID\u201119 on college students, noting that while anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation rose during the pandemic, recent studies suggest a gradual decline, yet the impact may persist through the 2030 graduating cohort. It highlights increased transfer enrollment (4.4% in fall\u202f2024) and homeschooling rates, linking these shifts to pandemic\u2011induced changes in student mobility and family dynamics. The piece also discusses how pandemic\u2011era middle\u2011schoolers\u2014particularly those in the 2028\u20112030 cohorts\u2014may exhibit heightened adaptability or over\u2011control issues, potentially influencing college outcomes and parental expectations. Overall, the narrative underscores the need for universities to address evolving student mental health, transfer patterns, and parental engagement as part of post\u2011pandemic recovery strategies.",
