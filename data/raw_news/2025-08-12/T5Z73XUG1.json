  "description": "GOP officials point to 500,000 registered Republicans as evidence of political momentum in Mountain State.",
  "content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., drew large crowds over the weekend for his \"Fighting Oligarchy Tour\" in a state that would seem otherwise loath to listen to his democratic socialist message.\n\nSanders spoke to a standing-room-only crowd at a theater in Wheeling \u2013 a city sandwiched between Ohio and Pennsylvania in the Northern Panhandle \u2013 and held two other events in the capital, Charleston, and in Lenore, a coal town of 1,300 just across the Tug Fork River from Kentucky.\n\nSanders said Republicans didn\u2019t win West Virginia in 2024 \u2013 the second-reddest state behind Wyoming \u2013 but that Democrats \"lost it.\"\n\nRepublicans, however, dismissed the left-wing firebrand\u2019s rallies. They said the real evidence of political momentum in the Mountain State is in the numbers the GOP continues to attract in a place where \"bluedog\" Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin and Rep. Nick Joe Rahall dominated politics only a decade ago.\n\nOn social media, Sanders celebrated his Lenore rally as a \"great turnout\" in a place \"where Trump won 74% of the vote.\"\n\n\"The working class here knows that it\u2019s absurd to slash Medicaid & SNAP to give tax breaks to billionaires. Trump didn\u2019t win West Virginia, Dems lost it. Working people want a real alternative.\"\n\nIn Wheeling, where behemoth industrial facilities line the Ohio River southward toward Huntington, Sanders said he came to \"beg\" for public political activism.\n\nWest Virginia Republican Party Chairman Josh Holstein told Fox News Digital in a Monday interview that if voters compared Sanders\u2019 Wheeling rally to his campaign event a decade ago in Huntington, they\u2019d notice that many more came to hear him for the first time than this past weekend.\n\n\"Our party has surpassed 500,000 registered Republicans in West Virginia for the first time ever. And it's a complete reversal from just nine years ago when the Democrats had an almost 200,000 registered voter advantage,\" Holstein said.\n\n\"It's just a remarkable turnaround, it really goes to show \u2013 where are the hearts and minds of the people of West Virginia? They're with us, they are not with the Democrats.\"\n\nWATCH: BERNIE SANDERS REACTS TO TRUMP'S IRAN STRIKES IN REAL TIME AT 'FIGHTING OLIGARCHY' RALLY\n\nHolstein said the progressive movement was at its height when Sanders was its de facto leader when he ran for president, and that his rallies were also a silent indictment of today's Democratic Party.\n\n\"I do find it a little hilarious that the only person that can really draw the crowd in West Virginia \u2013 or anywhere at this point \u2013 for the Democratic base is somebody that's not a Democrat,\" Holstein quipped.\n\nRep. Riley Moore, a Republican from the Eastern Panhandle \u2013 the one part of the state Sanders did not visit \u2013 offered his own irony.\n\n\"A millionaire socialist flying on a private jet to lecture working-class West Virginians about \u2018oligarchy\u2019 is laughable,\" said Moore.\n\n\"But there\u2019s nothing funny about the job and community-destroying green energy policies that Bernie Sanders pushes on behalf of the real [at] ESG-pushing [investment] institutions.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nState Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party, credited Sanders as the first of any federal lawmaker to hold a town hall in the state.\n\n\"Sen. Sanders came to West Virginia and did something our Republican congressional delegation refuses to do \u2013 hold open town hall meetings and take questions directly from the people they represent,\" Pushkin said.\n\n\"Everywhere he went, the crowds were standing-room-only, and they greeted him with real enthusiasm. West Virginians responded to his message loud and clear \u2013 they want to get dark money out of politics, protect Social Security and Medicare, and create real economic opportunity for everyone.\"",

      "text": "President Donald Trump received a rare rebuke from the Catholic Church after the Bishop of Charleston released a lengthy public statement condemning the U.S. immigration system, slamming the president's mass deportation efforts while crediting former President George W. Bush's \"acceptable\" plans.\nBishop Mark Brennan, who presides over the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston encompassing all of West Virginia, said America was \"built on the backs of men and women who came from other countries, whether freely or in chains.\"\n\"Now we see our government adopting harsh measures to deport as many immigrants as possible, often without distinguishing between true criminals and law-abiding persons.\"\n\"A government that says it wants to help families is willing to separate immigrant parents from their children. A government that oversees the economy wants to expel millions of workers upon whom the economy depends,\" Brennan went on.\nThe prelate said some parishioners have spoken to him about their support for Trump during the 2024 campaign over his pledge of a secure border that is now waning due to a \"wholesale assault on the majority of immigrants\u2026\"\n\"You expected a laser beam approach, not a floodlight,\" Brennan said.\nThe bishop compared some immigrants\u2019 plight to Matthew 2, which describes how Mary and Joseph fled Israel with an infant Jesus Christ.\n\"Get up and take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you. For, Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him,\" that Scripture reads.\n\"Our Church looks at the person, not his or her legal status, and, following Christ\u2019s teaching and example, reaches out to help the immigrant,\" Bishop Brennan continued.\nDEMS WANTED TO DRAW EVERY REPUBLICAN OUT OF MARYLAND BUT NOW LAMBAST TEXAS REDISTRICTING\n\"A person is more important than legal status. Even prisoners in jail are fed, clothed and have their health problems addressed, at least in well-run prisons.\"\nHe went on to praise the work Catholic Charities does to help migrants, adding that illegal entry into the U.S. is on the same misdemeanor statutory level as loitering and shoplifting.\nHearkening back to the 19th century, Brennan noted the Fugitive Slave Act had been used to \"calm tensions\" between the states and that the northern states refused to cooperate because they saw it as an unjust law.\n\"It is Catholic teaching that an unjust law does not bind in conscience. But one must be willing to accept the consequences of civil disobedience. Martin Luther King, Jr., was willing to go to jail rather than acquiesce in unjust laws, a willingness shared by pro-life activists and people protesting nuclear arms,\" Brennan added.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe bishop, however, added that both political parties have failed to substantively address immigration reform.\n\"Republican President George W. Bush presented an acceptable if imperfect plan to reform immigration laws, but his own party shot it down,\" he said.\n\"Democratic President Barack Obama said he would act on immigration reform but, with Democrats in control of Congress his first two years, he did not do so,\" Brennan added. \"Our politicians have failed us.\"\nThe White House called the statement \"rife with inaccuracies and misinformation. It\u2019s wrong and offensive to conflate ILLEGAL (sic) immigrants with legal immigrants who have followed the law and entered the country the right way.\"\n\"Anyone who has broken the law and entered the United States illegally is, by definition, not a \u2018law-abiding person.\u2019 President Trump is keeping his promise to the American people to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history, and unlike prior failed leaders like Joe Biden, he is empowering federal law enforcement officers to do their job and enforce the law. And without laws we are not a nation at all,\" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson."

      "text": "To some Senate Democrats facing competitive re-election bids, Chicago is not their kind of town.\nProminent Democrats from battleground states like Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jon Tester of Montana, and Jacky Rosen of Nevada all gave the city of big shoulders the cold shoulder, as their party convenes the Democratic convention in Chicago.\n\"Every candidate's going to make their own decision as to where they should be. And certainly, some candidates would much rather just be in their state talking to voters in their state,\" said Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich. Peters chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), in charge of getting Democrats elected to the Senate.\nDemocrats are trying to cling to their slim Senate majority this fall. There are currently 51 senators who caucus with the Democrats and 49 Republicans. The Senate battlefield favors Republicans with a host of Democrats up for re-election in red or swing states. It\u2019s an uphill climb for Democrats to knock off Republicans who are up this cycle like Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., is retiring. That seat is almost destined to turn red. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., is retiring. The race between Democratic nominee Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and GOP standard-bearer, former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., is tight.\nMICHELLE OBAMA WEARS NEARLY $3K PANTSUIT WHILE CRITICIZING THE WEALTHY AT DNC\nSo Democrats are ducking Vice President Harris and distancing themselves from progressives who take the stage at the convention, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\nBetter to blow off the Windy City when you can campaign back home and not face tough questions from the national press. Or, if you\u2019re a moderate, get your photo snapped with someone who is too far to the left. Or is controversial when it comes to the war in the Middle East. Or get asked about your take on President Biden dropping out, something Harris said, or the military service of Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\nJon Tester scratched Chicago for Pearl Jam.\nThe band\u2019s bassist, Montana native Jeff Ament, headlines a fundraiser for Tester in Missoula in the middle of the convention.\nIf Tester wins, he scores a fourth term in the Senate. Or, as Pearl Jam might sing, \"Come Back.\"\nDemocratic leaders applauded their colleagues who stayed away from Chicago.\n\"I think it will help Jon,\" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill. \"Jon is running as a Montana Democrat. Not a national Democrat.\"\nRosen is keeping her distance from Chicago as she seeks a second term in the swing state of Nevada. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., barely won re-election in 2022 by less than 8,000 votes. Cortez Masto\u2019s race was the last one called. Her victory preserved the Senate Democratic majority. President Biden bested former President Trump in the Silver State in 2020 by fewer than 35,000 votes. Even though Rosen is staying clear of Chicago and Harris, the senator\u2019s allies believe a win by the vice president in Nevada could boost Rosen. The Senate contest tilts slightly in favor of Rosen right now. The Cook Political Report shifted it from a \"toss-up\" to \"lean Democrat.\"\nVP HARRIS STILL HASN\u2019T RELEASED WEBSITE ON POLICY \u2014 SO TRUMP CAMP DID IT FOR HER\nHowever, some Democrats from swing states who are on the November ballot aren\u2019t shunning Chicago.\nRep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., is attending. He\u2019s running for the Senate against GOP nominee Kari Lake. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who caucuses with the Democrats, is retiring.\nAnd then there are sitting Democratic senators from competitive states: Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Bob Casey, D-Pa., surfaced in Chicago.\nThe Keystone State\u2019s other senator, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is not up this fall. But Fetterman skipped the convention. He said he had other things to do. Fetterman has sparred with the left over his positions on immigration, the border and the Middle East.\nHowever, this year's Democratic no-shows aren't the only ones who have skipped their respective party conventions.\nFormer Sen. Clarie McCaskill, D-Mo., faced a competitive re-election bid in 2012 when Democrats convened their convention in Charlotte. Tester and Manchin faced challenging re-election bids that year, too. Same with then-Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. All ducked the convention. And all won their races. Hard to argue with that strategy.\nMany Republicans weren\u2019t enamored with former Trump. So they dodged the GOP\u2019s 2016 convention in Cleveland and the pandemic-curbed convention in 2020.\nFormer Sens. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., weren\u2019t on hand for 2016.\nPOLITICAL PARALLELS BETWEEN 1968 AND 2024 AS THE DEMOCRATS RETURN TO CHICAGO\nSens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, sat out the 2020 show.\nIn some cases, prominent political figures have even spoken at the convention of the opposite party.\nThe late Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., addressed the Republican convention in New York, renominating President George W. Bush for a second term as he tangled with the Democratic nominee, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.\nFormer Republican Ohio Gov. and Congressman John Kasich spoke at the Democrats\u2019 quasi-convention (due to COVID) in 2020. This is especially interesting since Kasich ran for president as a Republican in 2016.\nThe late Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., came to the Senate as a full-fledged Democrat in early 1989. But after losing his 2006 primary \u2013 but winning re-election \u2013 Lieberman declared himself an \"independent Democrat.\" Still, Lieberman caucused with the party at the end of his career. He was Al Gore\u2019s running mate in 2000. But Lieberman spoke on behalf of 2008 Republican nominee and late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., at the GOP convention in St. Paul. The move almost prompted Democrats to bounce Lieberman from the Senate Democratic Caucus. Especially since the nation elected President Obama \u2013 who at the time was Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill.\nTracking the political taxonomy of former Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., is nearly as complicated as that of Lieberman. Crist was elected governor of Florida in 2006 as a Republican. He then lost the GOP Senate nomination to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in 2010. However, Crist still ran for Senate as an independent that year. Rubio won. Crist then spoke to the Democratic convention in Charlotte in 2012. Crist joined the Democratic Party later that year. He ran for governor as a Democrat and lost in 2014. Crist then ran for the House as a Democrat and won in 2016. He then ran again for governor in 2022 as the Democratic nominee. But Crist lost to Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMichael Bloomberg had been a lifelong Democrat but ran as a Republican for mayor of New York in 2001. As mayor, Bloomberg even scored the 2004 GOP convention for New York following 9/11. However, Bloomberg spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. And he ran as a Democrat for president in 2020, losing to President Biden.\nIn another era, it\u2019s possible that the Democratic loyalists attending the convention might send those back home a postcard reading \"wish you were here.\" But if Democrats truly want to hold the Senate, Brown, Tester and Rosen wouldn\u2019t receive one of those \"which you were here\" postcards. Because frankly, the best chance Democrats have to retain the Senate is to keep those lawmakers as far away from Chicago as possible."

      "text": "CHARLES TOWN, W.V. \u2013 A West Virginia state delegate-elect was arrested Thursday after allegedly threatening to kill multiple lawmakers, reportedly after being informed he might be dropped from his GOP caucus position.\nDel-elect Joseph de Soto, a medical doctor from Gerrardstown \u2013 about 100 miles west of Washington, D.C. \u2013 allegedly threatened several other delegates, including the Speaker of the House, on Tuesday, reportedly expressing outrage over being told to step down.\nDe Soto was listed in state jail records for Berkeley County as having been booked as a \"pretrial felon\" for making terroristic threats.\nFox News Digital has learned that De Soto was advised of a vote removing him from a position for \"undisclosed reasons,\" and that \"he was upset\" after hearing the news.\nDe Soto was reportedly being probed for potentially misrepresenting his medical and military information while running for office, and was subjected to a vote of expulsion from the GOP caucus, according to Huntington's CBS affiliate.\nDe Soto had threatened to kill several fellow Eastern Panhandle lawmakers as well as House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay.\n\"I am focused on four people who are evil \u2026 not angry, but at peace what I need to do,\" De Soto said, according to the criminal complaint. When an individual tried to stop de Soto from threatening people, his response was \"I did say I am going to kill people. I said I am going (sic) what is necessary to put them (sic) from office.\"\nDe Soto said he had a vision from the Mormon Angel of Moroni to \"destroy\" Wayne Clark, R-Charles Town, and Dels. Michael Hite, Joe Funkhouser and Charles Horst, all R-Martinsburg. He also claimed to have been told by God to kill another lawmaker from Weirton.\n\"They play stupid games, they are getting stupid awards,\" de Soto wrote in an email to a person who complained to police, according to a law enforcement report obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\"I am upset only with the Eastern Panhandle delegates. I have only begun... and won't stop,\" he said in an email to another individual according to the complaint, which ends with: \"they can all go to Hell. I will send them there as commanded,\"\nIn an interview Friday, one such delegate \u2013 Clark \u2013 said he received a call early in his five-hour commute home from Charleston to Charles Town that his family should relocate immediately due to a threat.\nTRUMP, GOP CELEBRATE JOE MANCHIN RETIREMENT\n\"I was driving straight into a snowstorm. So, I didn't get to meet up with my family until almost 7 p.m., and I got the call at 3 p.m.,\" Clark said.\nClark praised the Charles Town Police Department and the Jefferson and Berkeley County sheriff\u2019s offices for acting quickly to secure his family. He also said he hopes de Soto gets personal help.\n\"He obviously needs some sort of help because of some things that happened in his life prior. I don't know,\" he said.\nThe lawmaker said he understands that running for office means your identity and votes and comments are out in the public, but maintained that one\u2019s family should never be.\n\"Having someone make threats that are now affecting my family, I don't know if you ever had that call: \u2018Hey, Wayne. Get your family in a safe place\u2019. Whoa. Okay. That's a tough one to deal with.\"\nDe Soto had been elected as a Republican in the 91st District, which includes the suburbs of Martinsburg. However, he reportedly filed to change his affiliation to Democratic just before his arrest.\nThat change could set up a partisan or legal fight as to how he is replaced, as West Virginia provides that if a delegate vacancy exists, the outgoing lawmaker's party\u2019s county committee \"shall appoint a member of the party\" to the seat. The West Virginia State House is currently 89-11 Republican.\nDe Soto had reportedly been recently investigated for allegedly falsifying information about his medical career, which led to Republicans' concerns, according to Huntington's CBS affiliate.\nWest Virginia Democratic Party chair Del. Mike Pushkin said the party's thoughts are with the affected delegates and their families.\n\"No one\u2014especially those working in public service\u2014should ever have to fear for their safety or the safety of their loved ones,\" Pushkin, of Kanawha, said in a statement. \"These allegations are deeply serious and should be treated with the full weight of the law.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn a statement, WVGOP Chairman Matt Herridge said the party is aware of the allegations and facts of the case, \"as well as the steps the House GOP Caucus has taken toward [de Soto's] expulsion.\"\n\"Our elected officials sacrifice a lot to serve their communities, and it is a travesty for anyone to face the additional burden of threats made against themselves and their families. The West Virginia Republican Party supports our House leadership and their expulsion efforts.\"\n\"We disavow and condemn the behavior of the former Republican Delegate-elect and continue to thank all those who are willing to serve their communities and state, in spite of the serious challenges it too often poses.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the West Virginia State Police for additional comment on de Soto\u2019s arrest.\nA call to a number listed for de Soto was not returned."

      "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was delivering remarks at a \"Fighting Oligarchy\" rally in Tusla, Okla., on Saturday night when President Donald Trump announced the United States had successfully attacked three nuclear sites in Iran.\nAn aide interrupted Sanders' remarks to deliver the message Trump had just blasted off on Truth Social.\n\"We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,\" Trump said in the post.\nSanders read the piece of paper with Trump's Truth Social post to his supporters, shaking his head as the socialist senator processed what the president had just announced. \"No more wars!\" the crowd chanted.\nTrump added in the post: \"All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors.

The president does not have the right,\" Sanders shouted.\nSanders joins the bipartisan coalition in Congress who have called out the \"unconstitutionality\" of Trump striking Iran without congressional approval.\nA bipartisan War Powers Resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives this week as strikes between Israel and Iran raged on, and the world stood by to see if Trump would strike. Congress has the sole power to declare war under Article I of the Constitution.\nThe War Powers Resolution seeks to \"remove United States Armed Forces from unauthorized hostilities in the Islamic State of Iran\" and directs Trump to \"terminate\" the deployment of American troops against Iran without an \"authorized declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military forces against Iran.\"\n\"The American people do not want more war, more death!\" Sanders said. \"It might be a good idea if we concentrated on the problems that exist in Oklahoma and Vermont rather than getting involved in another war that the American people do not want.\"\nBut Sanders told the crowd not to give up on their vision for America's future.\n\"In this moment in American history, what we have got to do in Vermont and Oklahoma, in Texas, all over this country, is stand up and fight back, and tell them this is our country!\" Sanders said.\nSanders has been a vocal opponent of the United States joining Israel in its war against Iran as Trump weighed striking its nuclear facilities.\n\"Netanyahu is not the President of the United States,\" Sanders said on social media earlier this week.\n\"He should not be determining U.S. foreign and military policy. If the people of Israel support his decision to start a war with Iran, that is their business and their war. The United States must not be a part of it,\" he added.\nThe democratic socialist has been a vocal opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war against Gaza since Israel retaliated following Hamas' terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.\nAfter Israel launched preemptive strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities last week, Sanders said it was \"just his latest violation of international law,\" likening Netanyahu to a \"war criminal.\"\nThe Vermont senator was speaking at his second rally of the day, part of his southern swing of the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour that Sanders started in response to Trump's sweeping second-term agenda.\nRep. Greg Casar, D-Tx., and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Tx., are slated to join the Vermont senator at his rallies in Texas on Sunday.\nAnd Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., joined Sanders on his Western swing of the tour earlier this year.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe tour targets deep red districts currently held by Republicans, a strategy picked up by Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., who hosted town halls in Republican congressional districts, and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) through their \"People's Town Halls\" across the United States.\nSanders also held a rally in House Speaker Mike Johnson's hometown of Shreveport, La., on Saturday."

      "text": "Three Democratic New York City federal lawmakers attempted to gain entry to the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, where as many as 100 illegal immigrants are being held, according to one state lawmaker.\nImages posted Wednesday by the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC) showed Reps. Adriano Espaillat, Nydia Velazquez and Daniel Goldman walking toward the MDC with the Gowanus Expressway in the background.\nThe NYIC said the lawmakers had been refused entry to the prison, which has a history of high-profile inmates, including currently Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs and Luigi Mangione, and formerly ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen and MSNBC host Al Sharpton after he was arrested for trespassing on a Puerto Rican bombing range in 2001.\n\"Masked agents refused [the lawmakers\u2019] oversight access to Sunset Park [MDC] and have now trapped them between a fence and the facility,\" NYIC tweeted.\nSENATOR SAYS BALTIMORE ICE FACILITY HIDES \u2018EVIL PERSISTING IN DARKNESS\u2019 AFTER DEMS TRY NEWARK REDUX\n\"They can\u2019t get out or get in.\"\nA spokesperson for Espaillat told Fox News Digital officials \"closed the gate and ran away for about 20-30 minutes.\"\n\"No one could get in or out \u2013 either way \u2013 locking the members in for that time period.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Goldman and Velazquez for further comment.\nFox News Digital also reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for their accounting of the incident.\nGRAHAM MOCKS DEMOCRATS AS DEA CHIEF PICK CONFIRMS MS-13 GANG TATTOOS\nThe situation marks the third time in recent weeks that lawmakers have attempted to gain entry to otherwise secure federal holding facilities.\nRep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was arrested for allegedly accosting federal agents outside a jail in her home city of Newark.\nDEMOCRATS CELEBRATE RETURN OF SUSPECTED HUMAN TRAFFICKER KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA\nMcIver had been joined by several other lawmakers, including Rep. Robert Menendez Jr., D-N.J., son of the former senator, who is currently imprisoned separately on bribery charges.\nReps. Kweisi Mfume, Sarah Elfreth, Johnny Olzewski Jr. and Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., were all similarly rebuffed at a Baltimore ICE office where a handful of detained immigrants were reportedly being held.\nICE said at the time that the building, near Charles Center in the city\u2019s downtown, is not a true holding facility and only a processing center.\nIn the Brooklyn case, New York Democrats have railed against ICE for some time for their use of the jail as a detention facility for illegal immigrants.\nState Sen. Andrew Gounardes, D-Bay Ridge, said in July that MDC Brooklyn recently began holding more than 100 detainees and claimed that many have no criminal records.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"ICE is disappearing immigrants, many of whom have no criminal records, into a jail that a judge called \u2018contemptuous of human life and dignity.\u2019 That should appall all of us,\" Gounardes said in a statement.\n\"This isn\u2019t about public safety\u2014it\u2019s a show of force meant to instill fear in our communities and keep immigrants in the shadows. It\u2019s incredibly dangerous, disturbing and un-American. It must end now.\"\nPrior to his visit Wednesday, Goldman \u2013 who served as Sen. Adam Schiff\u2019s, D-Calif., lead attorney in the congressional impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump \u2013 lambasted the president for his administration\u2019s decision to utilize the MDC.\n\"Rather than continuing the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to boost staffing and reduce lockdowns at the MDC, the Trump administration has reversed those improvements and is now further overloading an already unsafe and understaffed facility with dozens of immigrants with no criminal history,\" Goldman said.\nAccording to ICE\u2019s Office of Congressional Relations website, members of Congress need only submit a request via email at least seven days in advance of their desired visit.\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson explained to Fox News Digital that the seven-day requirement is meant to \"prevent interference with the President\u2019s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions.\"\nThe spokesperson also noted that \"ICE law enforcement has seen a surge in assaults of 830%, as well as disruptions and obstructions to enforcement, including by politicians themselves,\" in an apparent reference to McIver.\nFox News Digital\u2019s Peter Pinedo contributed to this report."

      "text": "Democrats nationwide are supporting Texas lawmakers who fled the state to block a GOP-led mid-cycle redistricting vote \u2014 a sharp contrast to their stance a decade ago, when Maryland Democrats faced little criticism for a plan that nearly wiped out every Republican congressional seat.\nAfter the Old Line State lost a congressional seat in the 2010 census, Annapolis was tasked with drawing new lines for the now-eight remaining, and then-Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley ultimately testified about his eagerness to box-out the GOP.\nWhile overwhelmingly Democratic, Maryland features conservative strongholds at its geographic extremes \u2014 the Western Panhandle and Eastern Shore \u2014 and a smattering of Republican-majority communities throughout the more densely-populated center of the state.\nOne of the newly-drawn seats \u2014 the 3rd District represented by then-Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., \u2014 resembled what Fourth Circuit federal Judge Paul Niemeyer called a \"broken-winged pterodactyl, lying prostrate across Maryland.\"\n\u2018BUTTER KNIFE TO A GUNFIGHT': DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKER RIPS HIS PARTY'S STRATEGY IN REDISTRICTING BATTLE\nAppearing to painstakingly connect some of the state\u2019s wealthier suburban communities while steering clear of inner-city Baltimore and the military installation at Fort George Meade, the district had the rare distinction of being one that a person would be unable to drive across.\nIt began along I-795 northwest of Baltimore, curved east to form a thread-thin line across the city\u2019s northern border, drew in some northeastern suburbs before returning to linear form southward and again widening to encompass Inner Harbor and suburbs Halethorpe and Arbutus.\nAt one point near US-1 in Elkridge, someone could walk for a few minutes and enter three different congressional districts, including the 3rd as it traversed Ducketts Lane.\nThe \"pterodactyl\" then swung southwest to form its \"body\" north of Washington, D.C., before boomeranging into a different part of Howard and Anne Arundel Counties than it had just passed through \u2014 then shifting south again to trace the disconnected coastline of the Patapsco River and Chesapeake Bay.\nTucked in between Elkridge and Glen Burnie, a distance of only a few miles, was a tendril of another congressional district, the 2nd, otherwise centered east of Baltimore City.\nBetween Gibson Island and Annapolis, the \"pterodactyl\" 3rd crossed peninsulas and islands that precluded people from being able to traverse its entire length without crossing water, while narrowly separating the waterway from another district anchored closer to Washington.\nHOUSE DEMS REVIVE \u2018FOR THE PEOPLE ACT\u2019 WHICH MCCONNELL ONCE CALLED DEMOCRATIC POLITICIAN PROTECTION\nThe third district drew nationwide infamy but was staunchly defended by Maryland Democrats at the time, as they sought to draw out any congressional Republican they could.\nPreviously, Maryland Democrats shifted the boundaries of suburban D.C. districts in 2002 to help force out the last Beltway-area Republican congresswoman, Rep. Connie Morella. That area is now represented by Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\nThe 2010 decennial redraw that created the 3rd also sought to boot the rest of the GOP delegation, and eventually succeeded in making it halfway.\nThen-Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., an eccentric octogenarian who leaned conservative and represented the Western Panhandle\u2019s rural, blue-collar expanse, saw his district shifted to include very liberal, white-collar D.C. suburbs along I-270.\nThe entrenched now-99-year-old lost the following election to Democrat John Delaney by nearly the amount he won his previous race by, and moved far into West Virginia and settled off the grid.\nHERITAGE FOUNDATION SCHOLAR BREAKS DOWN \u2018ABSURD' FEDERALIZATION OF ELECTIONS IN DEMOCRATS' BILL\nRep. Andy Harris, the House Freedom Caucus chair and last remaining congressional Maryland Republican, remained \u2014 but not because his presence was missed.\nAs the Atlantic reported at the time, Maryland Democrats drew up a \"7-1\" map after the 2010 census, in hopes of booting Bartlett, but also briefly theorized an \"8-0\" map that would have forced Harris out.\nThe prospect of stretching safe Democratic districts too thin in hopes of swapping out the staunch conservative in the state\u2019s largest district by size proved too much of a risk, the outlet reported, noting concerns about even worse-looking district lines criss-crossing the Bay.\nBut, after the latest redistricting that proverbially killed the \"pterodactyl\" and other squiggly districts scrutinized in the lawsuit, Harris said it was clear his 1st District was again becoming more competitive.\n\"The Democrats can\u2019t defeat me at the ballot box so they\u2019re going to defeat me on the gerrymander vote, or at least they\u2019re going to attempt to,\" he told WYPR.\nIn a 2017 deposition amid a lawsuit over Maryland\u2019s map, O\u2019Malley admitted to seeking Bartlett\u2019s ouster or better: \"That was my hope.\"\nHe worked with Maryland\u2019s Democratic legislature to craft such a map.\n\"It was my intent to create\u2026 a district where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican.\"\nBartlett said at the time he wanted to work with O\u2019Malley to create a fairer map that also avoided racial gerrymandering around Washington.\nThe Washington Post repeatedly bashed the gerrymandered map, being one of the first to report the judge\u2019s \"pterodactyl\" moniker.\n\"Democratic Party leaders went overboard in carving up territory so that Democratic votes would be deployed to maximum advantage, even if it meant stitching them into districts resembling violently spilled coffee,\" one 2012 editorial read.\nAfter leaving office and taking the reins at the DNC for a time, O\u2019Malley struck a more critical tone against gerrymandering, telling a group at Boston College in 2017 that \"we must, on a state-by-state basis push for an end to gerrymandering\u2026\"\nHe also acknowledged his own history, remarking, \"I held that redistricting pen in my own Democratic hand. I was convinced that we should use our political power to pass a map that was more favorable for the election of Democratic candidates.\""

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: \u2018King Coal\u2019 still reigns as one of the most affordable, reliable and transportable sources of energy \u2013 and the U.S. still has a lot of it, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey told Fox News Digital in an interview at the National Governors Association's winter meeting.\nMorrisey acknowledged America's ongoing race with China to be the most powerful nation in terms of both energy development and AI technology. West Virginia, he said Saturday, seeks to lead the way.\n\"I'm still very hopeful that there's a future for coal,\" Morrisey said. \"Let me explain why: We're right now about to embark on an information technology arms race with China.\"\nMOUNTAIN STATE CRACKDOWN: WV GOV'S ORDER LEADS TO 60 SUSPECTED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMINAL DETENTIONS\n\"And we have to catch up to what they're doing in terms of the Chinese use of coal and many, many different types of fuel sources, because we can't let them get ahead of us as they're building capacity in AI, superintelligence, robotics and advanced manufacturing.\"\nWhile both nations are likely to rely on advances in nuclear energy and hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, there remain the \"resiliency, availability and affordability of coal,\" he said.\n\"I think there's an opportunity \u2026 to increase the capacity of some of the coal-fired power plants that have been slowed down in recent years. Because if we don't do that, we're not going to compete with the Chinese.\"\nThe governor said that one of his top priorities is to bring the Mountain State\u2019s coal infrastructure and industry back to a higher capacity.\n\"I think that it's sorely needed from a national security perspective.\"\nWest Virginia produced 89 million tons of coal in 2021, according to the latest data recorded by the state miners\u2019 office. That figure is down sharply from the 1940s through the late 1990s, when the state averaged upwards of 130 million tons per year.\nWV LAWMAKER ARRESTED AFTER THREATENING TO KILL ENTIRE REGION'S DELEGATION OVER CAUCUS BEEF\nWyoming remains tops in U.S. coal production, followed by West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Illinois.\n\"West Virginia is America's energy state. We're so rich in resources: coal and natural gas and water. And we have a lot of opportunities in front of us,\" Morrisey went on, adding that he was heartened by the substantive bipartisan discussions at the NGA in regard to speeding up the energy-permitting process at the state and federal levels.\n\"So when you're thinking about how to take advantage of those opportunities, you think of transmission, you think of permitting,\" he said, echoing Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro of neighboring energy powerhouse Pennsylvania, who pledged Friday to refund applicants if there are delays or if things go awry.\nIn terms of the Mountain State\u2019s role in what Morrisey and other governors at the NGA called the \"AI arms race\" with China, the state is predicted to build on Morrisey's predecessor, now-Sen. Jim Justice\u2019s efforts to grow the state\u2019s tech industry.\n\"I\u2019ve said over and over that we need to do everything possible to add these kinds of high-tech companies and jobs in West Virginia,\" Justice said in 2019. \"We have so many people in this state who are gifted beyond belief and who will be able to fill these spots and do incredible work. It\u2019s truly a pipeline of talent.\"\nOn Saturday, Morrisey also reflected on his group meeting with President Donald Trump, Cabinet secretaries and his fellow governors at the White House.\n\"They understand that you can't move energy at the speed of slow. And so we're eager to partner with them,\" he said, adding that Trump pledged to the governors that he would seek to eliminate 10 regulations for every one that his administration adds.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I think states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania and many other states have a chance to work closely with the Trump administration. It's going to be a lot easier, because they know how important it is to reassert American energy dominance \u2013 if you get the permitting right.\"\nMorrisey also spoke about his response to the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs across the southern border.\nLast month, Morrisey issued an executive order aimed at illegal immigrants in his state, which led to five dozen people being detained pending immigration status verification in the state's regional jail system.\nThe governor noted West Virginia's unfortunate spot as the state with the most drug overdose deaths per capita and said that both his and Trump's immigration policies are needed to fix that systemic crisis.\n\"We're working hand in hand with ice to identify illegal aliens and make sure that they can get deported. And this is really important to do, because, as President Trump said yesterday, when you actually remove a lot of these illegal aliens from the system, you're going to see a reduction in crime.\"\n\"It takes states working with the federal government to make sure that we're kind of reasserting our position and stopping all the horrific consequences of what happened with the illegal immigrants coming in. I know in West Virginia we really felt the impact of that through the massive amount of death that flowed from fentanyl flood[ing] in from China [via] the Mexican drug cartels.\"\nFox News Digital's Sophia Compton contributed to this report."
