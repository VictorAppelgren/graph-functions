To sign up to receive it via email (it\u2019s free), go here\n\nFrom Kevin Baxter: When the Dodgers arrived in Colorado on Sunday night they had a golden opportunity to pad their narrow division lead against with the worst team in the majors. Unfortunately, even with Thursday\u2019s 9-5 win over the Rockies, the Dodgers only managed a split of the four-game series.\n\nThey now head to San Diego for a crucial three-game-series against the Padres with the division lead once again up for grabs.\n\n\u201cI wish we had won all four, but it just didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way baseball is. So we\u2019ve got to go out there and regardless of the standings, we\u2019ve got to beat those guys.\u201d\n\nThe standings, however, loom large. The margin over the Padres is just a game.\n\nThe Dodgers will have a bit of momentum on their side after scoring 20 runs on 30 hits in the two wins at Coors Field. Thursday\u2019s matinee saw four players finish with multiple hits, including third baseman Alex Freeland, who was a career-best three for five with a run scored and another driven in. Freeland had six hits in the final three games in Denver.\n\nLanding six defensive backs by Christmas, the UCLA secondary coach added two more before the spring transfer portal window closed, making this race appear to be a runaway.\n\nBefore long, a formidable challenger emerged. Closing fast in the battle to become the Bruins\u2019 top recruiter on an almost entirely new coaching staff was Andy Kwon.\n\nHaving helped snag four transfers \u2014 a few of whom committed before his hiring \u2014 the offensive line coach went on to secure verbal commitments from two four-star high school prospects from Florida, the kind of highly coveted out-of-region talent that UCLA had seen go elsewhere in recent years.\n\nThe heated duel to see who could secure the best players, which included every new assistant and holdovers Ikaika Malloe and Jerry Neuheisel, was a welcome surprise to coach DeShaun Foster.\n\nFrom Ryan Kartje: Rising star USC wideout Ja\u2019Kobi Lane suffered a broken foot in May, but was fully cleared this week and will be ready for the Trojans\u2019 season opener against Missouri State, coach Lincoln Riley said Thursday.\n\nThe foot injury kept Lane limited through most of the summer. By the start of preseason camp, he was still being brought along slowly. During the portion of USC\u2019s practices open to reporters, Lane wasn\u2019t even running routes on air.\n\nLane wasn\u2019t deemed fully healthy until the final week of USC\u2019s preseason camp. Riley said that the junior wideout had actually \u201cprogressed a little bit ahead of schedule.\u201d\n\nFrom Gary Klein: As Matthew Stafford got to the podium on Thursday, he joked that he was sure reporters wanted to ask him questions about the paper cut he suffered.\n\nThe Rams star quarterback then fielded inquiries about the subject that clouds all conversation about the Rams: The back injury that sidelined Stafford until this week.\n\nStafford practiced for the fourth day in a row, another small milestone for the 17th-year pro and a team aiming to make a Super Bowl run.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is I feel pretty good,\u201d said Stafford, who practiced for the fourth day in a row. \u201cThe last couple days out there practicing, I was able to do even more than I thought I was going to be able to do the first day, and then I\u2019ve just been trying to stack days.\n\n1851 \u2014 The United States wins the first international yacht race. The schooner named \u201cAmerica\u201d beats 14 British yachts.\n\n1885 \u2014 Richard Sears beats Godfrey M. Brinley, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 to win the U.S. men\u2019s national tennis championship held at the Newport (R.I.) Casino.\n\n1898 \u2014 Malcolm Whitman beats Dwight F. Davis, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 to win the U.S. men\u2019s national tennis championship held at the Newport (R.I.) Casino.\n\n1948 \u2014 The Chicago Cardinals beat the College All-Stars 28-0 in front 101,220 fans at Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field.\n\n1949 \u2014 The Philadelphia Eagles beat the College All-Stars 38-0 at Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field. It\u2019s the largest shutout in the series, later matched by Green Bay in 1966.\n\n1950 \u2014 Althea Gibson becomes the first Black tennis player to be accepted in competition for the national championship.\n\n1957 \u2014 Floyd Patterson knocks out Pete Rademacher in the sixth round to retain his world heavyweight title at Sicks Stadium in Seattle.\n\n1984 \u2014 Evelyn Ashford sets the world record in the 100-meter dash with a clocking of 10.76 seconds in a meet at Zurich, Switzerland.\n\n1987 \u2014 Brazil snaps the 34-game winning streak of the U.S. men\u2019s basketball team with a 120-115 victory in the Pan Am Games. Oscar Schmidt scores 46 points to lead Brazil. Cuba wins a record 10 of 12 gold medals in boxing and beats the U.S. 13-9 in the baseball final.\n\n1999 \u2014 Jenny Thompson breaks Mary T. Meagher\u2019s 18-year-old 100-meter butterfly record at the Pan Pacific swim championships. Thompson with a time of 57.88 seconds lowers the mark of 57.93 set by Meagher.\n\n2004 \u2014 American sprinter Justin Gatlin wins the coveted Olympic 100m gold medal in Athens in 9.85 ahead of Francis Obikwelu of Portugal & American Maurice Greene.\n\n2008 \u2014 Usain Bolt helps Jamaica win the 400-meter relay final in 37.10 seconds for his third gold medal and third world record of the Beijing Games. Bolt becomes only the fourth man, and the first since Carl Lewis in 1984, to win all three Olympic sprint events. Bryan Clay wins the decathlon, the first American to win the 10-discipline event at the Olympics since Dan O\u2019Brien at Atlanta in 1996.\n\n2018 \u2014 Ohio State suspends football coach Urban Meyer three games for mishandling repeated professional and behavioral problems of an assistant coach, with investigators finding Meyer protected his protege for years through domestic violence allegations, a drug problem and poor job performance.\n\n2018 \u2014 The NCAA ditches the RPI for its own evaluation tool to select teams for the NCAA Tournament. The NCAA Evaluation Tool will rely on game results, strength of schedule, game location, scoring margin, net offensive and defensive efficiency and quality of wins and losses. NET will be used for the 2018-19 season by the committee that selects schools and seeds the tournament.\n\n1917 \u2014 Pittsburgh\u2019s Carson Bigbee set a major league record \u2014 since tied \u2014 with 11 at-bats in a 22-inning game against Brooklyn. Pirate Elmer Jacobs pitched 16 2-3 innings in relief. The game was also the fourth consecutive extra-inning game by the Pirates for a total of 59 innings, a National League record.\n\n1934 \u2014 Pitcher Wes Ferrell hit two home runs to give the Boston Red Sox a 3-2 triumph over the Chicago White Sox in 12 innings. Trailing 2-1, Ferrell hit a home run in the eighth inning to tie the score and with two out in the 12th, Ferrell connected again for the game-winner.\n\n1961 \u2014 Roger Maris, en route to his 61-home run season, became the first player to hit his 50th homer in August. He connected off California pitcher Ken McBride in a 4-3 loss to the Angels.\n\n1965 \u2014 In the third inning of a game against the Dodgers, pitcher Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants hit catcher John Roseboro of the Dodgers in the head with his bat. A 14-minute brawl ensued and Roseboro suffered cuts on the head. Marichal thought Roseboro threw too close to his head when returning the ball to Sandy Koufax.\n\n1971 \u2014 The Oakland Athletics opened and closed the game with solo homers to beat the Boston Red Sox 2-1. Boston pitcher Sonny Siebert gave up both, Bert Campaneris lead off the game and Reggie Jackson ended it with two out in the ninth inning.\n\n1984 \u2014 New York Mets right-hander Dwight Gooden, at 19, fanned nine San Diego Padres to become the 11th rookie to strike out 200 batters in one season.\n\n1989 \u2014 Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers became the first pitcher to strike out 5,000 batters. Ryan struck out 13, walked two and allowed only five hits in a 2-0 loss to Oakland. Ryan began the night needing six strikeouts and fanned Rickey Henderson swinging, leading off the fifth inning, for the record.\n\n1999 \u2014 Mark McGwire became the first player to hit 50 homers in four consecutive seasons, hitting Nos. 49 and 50 in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Mets.\n\n2007 \u2014 The Texas Rangers became the first team in 110 years to score 30 runs in a game, setting an American League record in a 30-3 rout of the Baltimore Orioles in the first game of a doubleheader.

      "text": "Jerry Neuheisel feels like he\u2019s home again in his return to UCLA as a graduate assistant\n- Share via\nJerry Neuheisel jogged across UCLA\u2019s practice field, his mop of blond hair flapping with every step.\nHe had happily shed the hat that usually conceals his long, flowing locks to bask in a warm, sunny morning with just a few wispy clouds overhead.\nIt was another reminder that the graduate assistant wasn\u2019t at Texas A&M anymore.\nHe was home.\n\u201cWhen I left Texas, it was 32 degrees, it was cold and I drove 22 straight hours and I got here to L.A. and it was 75 degrees,\u201d Neuheisel said, referring to his departure after one season coaching with the Aggies. \u201cSo on days like this, I can\u2019t wear a hat.\u201d\nHe actually wears quite a few in his return to the school where he played and where his father, Rick, once starred and coached. The younger Neuheisel spent part of a recent practice thwacking receivers with blue pads, simulating the bumps they might absorb in coverage near the line of scrimmage, before lofting several passes and even defending a walk-on during one route.\nThe relentless optimism that\u2019s a well-known family trait was also on display. Constantly. Neuheisel spent so much time applauding players\u2019 efforts that it felt as if he might be starting a new school tradition, the 88-clap.\n\u201cHe\u2019s absolutely giddy to be back in Westwood,\u201d Rick Neuheisel said.\nJerry was born at UCLA Medical Center on the day of the Bruins\u2019 spring game in 1992. His delivery provided an excused absence for the only practice Rick missed during a lengthy coaching career that ended with UCLA in 2011.\n\u201cAll my fellow coaches came over to see him,\u201d Rick, a receivers coach at the time under Terry Donahue, said of his son\u2019s arrival at the hospital. \u201cHe had no choice but to be a Bruin.\u201d\nJerry was a freshman at UCLA when Rick was fired after the 2011 season, but he did not join the team until the following spring. He became the backup quarterback, completing an improbable rally against Texas in September 2014 when he came off the bench after starter Brett Hundley sustained an elbow injury. Neuheisel\u2019s 33-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Payton with three minutes left provided the winning points in a 20-17 victory.\n\u201cSome of the things that happened to him while he was a player there,\u201d Rick said, \u201cwere just fantastic and dream-come-true stuff.\u201d\nThe ending wasn\u2019t storybook. Jerry left UCLA after the 2015 season with a year of eligibility remaining, saying that it hurt too much to remain a backup. He spent a season as the starting quarterback with the Obic Seagulls of Japan\u2019s X League, reaching the championship game, while also coaching quarterbacks at nearby Keiko University.\nThen came a call from Noel Mazzone, his former offensive coordinator at UCLA who had moved on to Texas A&M.\n\u201cHe said, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me, I don\u2019t care what you say,\u2019 \u201d Neuheisel recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018You\u2019re right, I\u2019m coming.\u2019 I got on the next plane to Texas A&M.\u201d\nNeuheisel was on the Aggies\u2019 sideline in September at the Rose Bowl when the Bruins completed the biggest comeback in school history after trailing by 34 points in the third quarter. His allegiances were split.\n\u201cI was dying for our guys because we put so much out there to win that game,\u201d Neuheisel said, \u201cbut part of me was excited because it was something UCLA needed, that fight. To come back and win that game was a big-time moment for this program.\u201d\nBruins coach Chip Kelly had known of Neuheisel long before inviting him to join his staff after replacing Jim Mora in November. Kelly coached against Rick Neuheisel while at Oregon and saw Jerry coach while observing a spring practice last year in College Station, Texas.\n\u201cIt was just a real good fit,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cjust because institutional knowledge, guys that have been around can tell you how to get around campus and he is a great, really, really good young football coach who has a bright future.\u201d\nNeuheisel works primarily with the receivers, including senior Christian Pabico, one of a handful of former Bruins teammates still on the roster. Neuheisel would figure to be the perfect stand-in for a team one quarterback short of the five needed to complete one passing drill it runs each practice, but Kelly, a former high school quarterback, fills that role.\n\u201cI\u2019m the only guy who\u2019s not coaching in that period,\u201d Kelly explained, \u201cso he\u2019s gotta coach.\u201d\nWhenever he speaks, Neuheisel sounds like a coach \u2026 Rick Neuheisel, to be exact. The only difference is that Jerry is more rapid-fire when he talks as opposed to his father, who is more measured and deliberate. Even people who have spent significant time around both sometimes have trouble telling the difference.\n\u201cIf you close your eyes and either one of them is talking, you\u2019re not going to know who\u2019s who,\u201d said Minnesota Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, a teammate of Jerry\u2019s at Los Angeles Loyola High and UCLA. \u201cThey sound the same, a lot of their mannerisms are the same. I mean, he\u2019s his dad\u2019s son. It\u2019s very apparent.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very similar to his dad, very charismatic \u2014 a funny guy, smart guy and people listen when he talks. So he has all the right tools to be a successful football coach.\u201d\nNow Neuheisel is learning from one of the most successful college coaches of the last decade. Rick Neuheisel said he constantly calls his son to find out the latest thing that has wowed him about working for Kelly, who guided Oregon to major bowl games in each of his four seasons (2009-12) with the Ducks.\nRick, who attended UCLA\u2019s practice Saturday and spoke with players, said his biggest advice to his son is to look around and appreciate the coaching climb, even when you\u2019re closer to the bottom than the top.\n\u201cEnjoy every rung on the ladder,\u201d Rick said. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of an eagerness by young coaches to want to climb and get to be a full-time coach and get to be a coordinator and then to be a head coach as fast as is humanly possible, and while we all hope that that can be the case somewhere down the road, you want to make sure that you\u2019re learning and enjoying every step along the way because as the saying goes, you make the big-time where you are.\u201d\nJerry, who will turn 26 later this month, doesn\u2019t want to move his coaching ladder again, making the rest of his ascent at his alma mater.\n\u201cThis is my dream school,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where I want to be. I would never want to leave this place and I still think I owe this place a Rose Bowl at some point, so I\u2019m happy to be back. I was born on the campus and I\u2019ve been here my whole life, so this place feels like home.\u201d"

Unfortunately, even with Thursday\u2019s 9-5 win over the Rockies, the Dodgers only managed a split of the four-game series.\nThey now head to San Diego for a crucial three-game-series against the San Diego Padres with the division lead once again up for grabs.\n\u201cI wish we had won all four, but it just didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way baseball is. So we\u2019ve got to go out there and regardless of the standings, we\u2019ve got to beat those guys.\u201d\nThe standings, however, loom large. On July 7, the Dodgers led the division by six games. The margin is now just a game.\nShohei Ohtani is hit on the leg by a line drive during another poor start, later leaves game, as Dodgers fall to the Rockies.\nThe Padres, who have won 12 of 19 games in August, are the third-hottest team in the National League this month. The Dodgers are a game over .500.\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now and I can\u2019t change it. I feel good about our club going into San Diego.\u201d\nHis club will have a bit of momentum on its side after scoring 20 runs on 30 hits in the two wins at Coors Field. Thursday\u2019s matinee saw four players finish with multiple hits, including third baseman Alex Freeland, who was a career-best three for five with a run scored and another driven in. Freeland had six hits in the final three games in Denver.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like I\u2019m building confidence now,\u201d said Freeland, who entered Thursday hitting .180 since his call-up from triple-A Oklahoma City three weeks ago. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of spent a little time here now and I\u2019m getting comfortable.\u201d\nThe Dodgers also got a fourth straight strong effort from starter Clayton Kershaw (8-2), who gave up three runs in 5\u2154 innings. Kershaw has allowed just five runs over 23 2/3 innings this month, dropping his season ERA nearly 50 points to 3.13.\nThat was also good enough to keep his team in first, something he noted afterward.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take anything for granted in Colorado, obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we\u2019re [one] up going in [to San Diego]. So we feel good about it.\u201d\nFreeland agreed.\n\u201cWe definitely could have produced more. But you know what? We\u2019re going to take this one today and take this momentum and bring it into San Diego,\u201d he said.\nAfter Kershaw won the opener of a three-game series with the Padres at Dodger Stadium a week ago, the teams were even atop the N.L. The Dodgers wound up sweeping that series and have won eight of 10 with the Padres overall this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played well against those guys this year,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to give us everything they have this weekend.\u201d\nThe Dodgers got started early Thursday with Mookie Betts, who reached base four times, opening the game by walking on five pitches. Freddie Freeman followed with a two-run home run, his 16th of the season, to center field.\nJust when you might think Clayton Kershaw has done all he can for the Dodgers, he proves against the San Diego Padres he can still be a dominant force for the team.\nThe Rockies cut the lead in half in the bottom of the inning on a popup that got lost in the sun, a sacrifice bunt, a balk and an RBI groundout. But they would get no closer, with the Dodgers scoring in each of the first five innings to take an 8-2 lead.\nFreeland had his first career triple along with a double and single, falling a homer shy of the cycle. He had six hits in the final three games in Denver. Betts finished two for three with two walks and two runs scoring while Freeman, who was two for five, raised his season average to .304 and is hitting .328 for August.\nShohei Ohtani feeling fine\nRoberts said pitcher/designated hitter Shohei Ohtani is fine after taking a line drive off his right thigh in Wednesday\u2019s game. Ohtani was scheduled to have Thursday off and Roberts said he\u2019ll be back in the lineup Friday.\nTanner Scott and Kirby Yates set to return\nThe Dodgers will activate reliever Tanner Scott before Friday\u2019s game in San Diego and reliever Kirby Yates on Saturday. Scott has been out a month with inflammation in his left elbow while Yates has missed three weeks with lower back pain.\nRoki Sasaki making progress\nRight-hander Roki Sasaki made progress in his second rehab start Wednesday, going 3\u2153 innings and giving up two runs (one earned) on three hits. He walked three and struck out two before leaving after 60 pitches. He will make another rehab start next week before the Dodgers make any decision on his role in September. The team had talked about using Sasaki in a relief role."

      "text": "Times of Troy: Six bold predictions for the USC football team in 2025\n- Share via\nWelcome back to the Times of Troy newsletter, and the happiest of birthdays to my son, Camden, who turns 2 today. Judging by how often he\u2019s pointing at the TV and screaming for me to turn on NFL preseason games, I\u2019d say he is as ready for \u201cball ball\u201d season as anyone.\nFortunately for him \u2014 and us \u2014 we are less than two weeks out from USC\u2019s season opener against Missouri State. There\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know. But before we walk our way through the schedule next week, it\u2019s time to get on the record with a few things I think might happen with USC..\nHere are six bold predictions for the Trojans in 2025:\nJayden Maiava will throw for 30 touchdowns this season. But he\u2019ll also throw 15 interceptions.\nMaiava made a concerted effort over the summer to eliminate the back-breaking mistakes he struggled with last season. He dug deeper into Lincoln Riley\u2019s offense, and he worked on his mechanics with the experts at the 3DQB training academy. But Maiava\u2019s style is always going to lend itself to high variance. He loves to chuck it deep and still seems to throw it too often into coverage. That\u2019s going to yield some thrilling results at times on an offense that should be more conducive to big plays. But 4.3% of his passes last season were deemed turnover-worthy by Pro Football Focus. That was third-highest in the Big Ten and too high for USC\u2019s offense to reach its potential. His big-time throw rate was also third-highest in the Big Ten at 5.1%, though, and that was before he fully grasped the Trojans offense. There\u2019s room to grow here. But I\u2019d caution that his proclivity for throwing caution to the wind might just be a part of the deal with Maiava.\nUSC will be shuffling its offensive line all season.\nUSC hasn\u2019t really had a reliable front since Riley\u2019s first season, and this is by far his most unproven unit yet. The interior is a legitimate concern if DJ Wingfield isn\u2019t deemed eligible. I expect at some point this season we\u2019ll see a former walk-on (Kilian O\u2019Connor) and a preferred walk-on (Kaylon Miller) start a game at center and guard, respectively. And while both should be commended for their development, that\u2019s not a good sign for USC\u2019s offense. The Trojans desperately need Elijah Paige to deliver on his huge potential this season at left tackle, Alani Noa to iron out some of his inconsistencies at right guard, and Tobias Raymond to live up to Riley\u2019s billing of him as one of the best players on the team. That\u2019s a lot to ask. Expect many different combinations up front for USC, with J\u2019Onre Reed, Micah Banuelos and Justin Tauanuu also logging starts throughout. That\u2019s eight different starters on the line, which would be the most since Riley took over at USC.\nUSC will have two 1,000-yard receivers.\nThe last time a duo of Trojan receivers crossed that mark was 2019, so not that long ago, but it\u2019s been pretty rare around college football the past decade. Less than two teams on average per year, to be exact. Still, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say Ja\u2019Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon both cross that mark. Lemon\u2019s last eight games of 2024 put him on pace for more than 1,000 yards already, and that was with a much less potent downfield passing game for most of the season. Lane might be the more unlikely of the two to reach this mark, but I\u2019m betting on talent. He has to see more targets this season. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a target share for the two of them that nears 50%. In the bowl game, the two of them saw a combined 18 targets, a 46% target share.\nWalker Lyons will be USC\u2019s most productive tight end.\nThis is no shade on Lake McRee, who has been a reliable tentpole of the Trojans\u2019 attack for a while now. But Lyons is just the sort of tight end that should thrive in Riley\u2019s offense. More than anyone Riley has worked with yet at USC, Lyons is more in the mold of Mark Andrews, who emerged as one of the top tight ends in college football in Riley\u2019s first season at Oklahoma. Like Andrews, he came to college as more of a skilled receiver learning to play inline. Now it\u2019s clear he\u2019s ready for the next step. A breakout season could be incoming.\nUSC will have three first-round picks next April.\nA look at recent history might suggest that I\u2019m crazy. USC had three players drafted total last spring and haven\u2019t seen three Trojans drafted in the first round since 2009. Alas, I\u2019m still not deterred. Either or both of Lemon and Lane could hear their names called in the first round. Kamari Ramsey might have been a first-round pick last season, if he\u2019d declared, and Gentry has all the tools to make it happen. It\u2019s not crazy to think that others could enter the chat too. With a huge breakout season, Maiava, Paige and defensive tackle Devan Thompkins are intriguing cases to consider. Though, the first round might be a bit too optimistic.\nUSC will rediscover its pass rush.\nCount me as someone who believes USC\u2019s defense takes another step forward. And I expect that progress will be most apparent in the defensive front, where USC could barely conjure a pass rush last season. Braylan Shelby led the 2024 defense with \u2026 three measly sacks. I expect we\u2019ll see five different Trojan pass rushers pass that number this season. Gentry and sophomore Kameryn Fountain are both capable of reaching double-digit sacks, while Shelby, Anthony Lucas and freshman Jahkeem Stewart each are sure to chip in a handful on their own. Judging by early praise, Stewart could very well be the team\u2019s best pass rusher by December.\nHave your own bold takes or predictions that you want to get on the record in the next Times of Troy newsletter? Send them to me at ryan.kartje@latimes.com, and I\u2019ll include some of the best ones next week.\nExtra points\n\u2014The NCAA\u2019s 2010 sanctions of USC only get more insane by the year. This week, the NCAA issued its punishment in the Michigan sign-stealing scandal. Aside from a $20-million fine, which is substantial, the punishment reflected how much has changed societally since 2010, and the reality of how toothless the NCAA has become. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2010, when the NCAA dropped the hammer on USC, taking away 30 scholarships and banning them from bowl games for two seasons amid the Reggie Bush saga, while the BCS stripped the school of its 2004 title. That punishment was devastating primarily to players who had nothing to do with the crime. This latest ruling clearly tried to avoid that, which is a commendable change from the NCAA. But it did understandably upset some USC fans who are still frustrated with how they were treated in a case that had far less of an actual influence on the field.\n\u2014Special teams coach Ryan Dougherty understands USC\u2019s placekicking hasn\u2019t been good enough. Michael Lantz hit just 14 of his 21 attempts (66.7%) last season. Denis Lynch hit 10 of 14 (71%) in 2023 and 15 of 22 in 2022 (68.2%). A few more made field goals last season might have made the difference in some of USC\u2019s narrow losses. This season, Dougherty will put his faith in sophomore Caden Chittenden, who set the Mountain West record last year for a freshman kicker with 26 made field goals. Chittenden seems like a safe bet to be a significant improvement at a position that\u2019s been lacking during Riley\u2019s tenure.\n\u2014Makai Lemon will be USC\u2019s top punt returner. Some of you might wonder why USC would invite the added risk of having Lemon return punts. But Riley wouldn\u2019t even entertain that line of thinking this week. The coach said that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing anyone would do that would keep us from playing them on punt return.\u201d Given how electric Lemon can be in the return game, I get it. USC has just one punt return touchdown during Riley\u2019s entire tenure. That unit needs to be better.\n\u2014Rawlinson Stadium is officially open. Which means the first step of USC\u2019s $200-million Athletics West capital project is complete. Reporters were invited last week on a tour of the Trojans\u2019 gleaming new soccer and lacrosse stadium, and let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a significant improvement on their old home, McAlister Field. McAlister could barely fit 1,000 people, didn\u2019t have lights and didn\u2019t even have locker rooms for the team. Rawlinson has a capacity of 2,500, a press box, viewing decks for fans and a video board, while the lockers are customized based on feedback directly from the players. Women\u2019s soccer coach Jane Alukonis made clear to reporters how much Rawlinson would influence the program\u2019s recruiting efforts. USC invested $38 million to make it happen. Now we can see why.\nIn case you missed it\nMichigan hit with major fine for sign-stealing scheme. Jim Harbaugh\u2019s NCAA exile extended 10 years\nMicah Banuelos works to make up for lost time as USC aims to build its strongest offensive line\nWhy USC is not in the AP Top 25 preseason poll\nWhat I\u2019m reading this week\nSo much has been written about Todd Marinovich over the years, but never has he written about his harrowing journey in his own words until now. In \u201cMarinovich: Outside the Lines of Football, Art, and Addiction\u201d, the former USC quarterback opens up a vein, giving readers an unvarnished look at how he went from child prodigy and \u201cRobo Quarterback\u201d to drug addict and NFL washout. It\u2019s rare that athletes really examine themselves at the level that Marinovich does in this autobiography. He even tries to correct the record about his father, Marv, who he writes was a \u201cthorny scapegoat.\u201d\nIf you find Marinovich and his story of redemption at all interesting, I\u2019d recommend checking it out.\nUntil next time ...\nThat concludes today\u2019s newsletter.

      "text": "- Share via\nSlammed Diego.\nThose pesky rivals from down south staggered away from their weekend stay at Dodger Stadium Sunday with spirits bruised, egos bloodied and Manny Machado flattened.\nCanned Diego.\nArriving here shortly after stealing first place, little brother spent the next three days giving it back to a Dodger team that met the moment while the Padres recoiled from it.\nFanned Diego.\nIt was a sweeping sweep of a sweep, the Dodgers winning their third consecutive game from the Padres Sunday by a 5-4 margin that does not begin to elucidate the difference between these two teams.\nThe Dodgers now lead the National League West by two games, but it feels like 20. Both teams have 38 games remaining in the season, including three next weekend in San Diego, but any sort of real challenge by the Padres feels fabricated.\nThe Dodgers are the deeper team. The Dodgers are the more focused team. The Dodgers are the better team.\nMookie Betts hits a home run in the bottom of the eighth to lift the Dodgers past the Padres and into a two-game lead in the NL West.\nThe final weekend blow was an eighth-inning, game-winning drive into the left-field pavilion by Mookie Betts, but this series wasn\u2019t nearly that close.\nThe Dodgers did everything right, and the Padres did everything dumb.\nThe Dodgers charged, and the Padres choked.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t play as well as we\u2019d like to have, and the series didn\u2019t go like we wanted it to,\u201d Padres manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cBut ... this team is more than in a great place.\u201d\nThat would nonetheless currently be second place, which, after this weekend, seems like an appropriate spot.\nMeanwhile, for one of the few stretches in this curious summer, the Dodgers behaved like the first-place tenants they are.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in that clubhouse doubted our abilities and how good we can be,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cHonestly, it was just good to play a really good series, start to finish.\u201d\nTruly, from start to finish. The injury-prone Dodgers starters allowed just three runs in 17 innings, the much-maligned Dodger bullpen finished with just three allowed runs in 10 innings, and the Padres were bad enough that nothing else mattered.\nJust when you might think Clayton Kershaw has done all he can for the Dodgers, he proves against the San Diego Padres he can still be a dominant force for the team.\nOn Friday, Machado gave the Dodgers a run when he botched a bunt, and later hastily popped out on the first pitch in the eighth inning with two out and the tying and go-ahead runs on base.\nOn Saturday, the Padres were thrown out attempting to steal three times in the first two innings while center fielder Jackson Merrill added to the madness by dropping a fly ball that cost them two runs.\nThen on Sunday, the Padres outhit the Dodgers 10-6 but couldn\u2019t get out of their own way long enough to ever pose a real threat.\nIn the third inning, Freddy Ferm\u00edn ran into an out on a single to right-center, Andy Pages nailing him by a mile. Then, with a runner on third and two out, Machado swung at the second pitch and grounded out to first.\nTwo innings later, Machado stranded two more runners with a groundout, but his humiliation was just beginning. In the seventh, Machado threw his bat and walked toward first on a strike call. After sheepishly returning to home plate amid a taunting roar from the hostile Dodger Stadium crowd, he flied out with a runner on second.\nMachado wasn\u2019t done yet. Appropriately, he was the final out of the game, swinging wildly at an Alex Vesia fastball for a strikeout on a foul tip that left the former Dodger one for 12 for the weekend.\n\u201cWe can blink, and I\u2019m pretty confident within a week or so, we\u2019ll be talking and be like, \u2018Man, Manny\u2019s got eight RBIs in the last five days,\u2019 so we\u2019re not concerned about it,\u201d said Shildt, who claimed his star was stung by bad calls by home plate umpire Jeremie Rehak. \u201cUnfortunately, some pitches that are outside the strike zone got called on him. Which, again, is unfortunate when they\u2019re not trying to throw strikes all the time to him. They\u2019re taking their chances and to get rewarded on balls that are outside the zone is a little frustrating.\u201d\nBefore the series, in the wake of four consecutive dispiriting losses, Roberts called on his team to show more focus and urgency. Their final answer, on a day they could have easily shrugged off after winning the first two games of the series, came quickly and dramatically.\nTyler Glasnow, pitching in his biggest game as a Dodger, struck out three in the top of the first en route to eight strikeouts in five innings.\nThen, in the bottom of the first against the Padres\u2019 Yu Darvish, Shohei Ohtani singled, Betts walked and Freddie Freeman blasted a home run over the right-center field fence. One out later, Pages homered to left and the tone had been set.\n\u201cI think we all know who we are in here, in this team and how good we can be,\u201d said Freeman. \u201cWe just gotta play good baseball like we did this weekend ... we know who we are inside. And gotta keep it going.\u201d\nRoberts was as good as any of them, doing a masterful job all weekend handling his outmanned bullpen, succeeding again Sunday by listening to his most reliable reliever.\nAfter finishing up an eighth inning during which the Padres tied the game on a Jose Iglesias grounder, Vesia was promptly told he was done for the day, as Justin Wrobleski was scheduled to pitch the ninth.\nA solid effort by Blake Snell coupled by several Padres mistakes allow the Dodgers to take a 6-0 win and sole possession of first place in the NL West.\nBut Vesia had a better idea. He told Roberts he wanted the ball if the Dodgers took the lead in the eighth, and when Betts homered, Vesia was ready.\n\u201cSo I told Doc, I walked up to him and said, \u2018Hey, like, if we\u2019re up, I want it.\u2019\u201d Vesia recalled. \u201cHe was like, \u2018OK, you got it.\u2019 Sure enough, Mook, bang, homers. Sweet, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nSweet indeed. Vesia\u2019s hitless ninth was symbolic of a bullpen that spent the weekend making every big pitch ... while the Padres missed every big pitch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the dawg, right?\u201d said Vesia. \u201cWe still have that. That doesn\u2019t just go away. Every single one of us, we\u2019re leaning on each other. And we know as a group how good we are.\u201d\nSo, too, do the Padres.\nDone Diego."

      "text": "A year after stumbling at Big Ten media days, UCLA\u2019s DeShaun Foster is poised and confident\n- Share via\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 It\u2019s easier for everything to go according to script when you have one.\nAs DeShaun Foster strode across the stage inside a convention center here Thursday afternoon, the UCLA football coach clutched several pages of prepared remarks that helped him navigate a lengthy opening monologue with poise and confidence.\nPoking fun at his widely mocked and memed performance from a year ago, when he delivered a short, unrehearsed address filled with awkward pauses and an uneasy smile, Foster indulged reporters in a short recap of the lowlights.\n\u201cLast year I stood up here and reminded everyone that UCLA is in L.A., which looking back might have been the most obvious geography lesson in Big Ten history,\u201d Foster said. \u201cBut you know what? Important things are worth stating clearly. We are in L.A., and we\u2019re proud to be in L.A. This year we\u2019re ready to show the Big Ten what L.A. football looks like when it\u2019s firing on all cylinders.\u201d\nThe Bruins can only hope their turnaround on the field is as stunning as their coach\u2019s transformation onstage.\nA year ago, as UCLA stumbled to a 1-5 start, \u201cWe\u2019re in L.A.\u201d became a catchphrase freely wielded to ridicule a team that often looked as lost as its coach had while delivering his opening remarks inside Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.\nRather than run from his troubles, Foster barreled ahead like a running back who found an opening in a wall of defenders. The rookie coach found his footing with a team that won four of its last six games, narrowly missing an opportunity to play in a bowl game.\nHis offseason was even more impressive. Foster overhauled his staff (only two assistants from last season remain) and redoubled his recruiting efforts, leading to a 2026 high school class ranked No. 21 nationally by 247Sports.com. Landing Nico Iamaleava from the transfer portal after the quarterback\u2019s spring of discontent at Tennessee generated immediate buzz.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just excited to have a playoff quarterback, somebody that was able to lead his team to the playoffs,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThey might not have gotten the outcome that they wanted, but he still was able to play. He showed how tough he was in that game. Just being able to come back home and be comfortable and being in a familiar environment, I think the sky is the limit. We\u2019re excited about this.\u201d\nWhile Iamaleava\u2019s arrival isn\u2019t expected to vault the Bruins into contention for the Big Ten title, much less the College Football Playoff \u2014 UCLA was picked to finish 15th in the 18-team conference by a media poll conducted by Cleveland.com \u2014 there is recent precedent for teams taking a big leap in their coach\u2019s second season.\nColorado finished 9-4 last season after going 4-8 in Deion Sanders\u2019 debut season and Arizona State went 11-3 and made the CFP one year after going 3-9 in Kenny Dillingham\u2019s first season. Foster said he hopes this season goes as well as his second in the NFL, when he helped the Carolina Panthers reach the Super Bowl.\nQuestions abound, particularly on a defense that loses every key playmaker, as the Bruins prepare to open training camp in Costa Mesa on Wednesday. The team will practice off campus for the first time since training in San Bernardino in 2016 because of the installation of a grass field outside the Wasserman Football Center.\nSome changes around the program feel more than cosmetic. UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond said that Foster\u2019s willingness to make wholesale changes on his coaching staff after just one season and the associated recruiting surge are signs that this is a program on the rise.\nUCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson suing the NCAA to restore his eligibility for this season after transferring from Appalachian State.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just brought a vibe back, a buzz and energy about UCLA football that we haven\u2019t had since I\u2019ve been here, quite honestly,\u201d Jarmond said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you want to see.\u201d\nSeveral hours after he spoke in the morning, Foster met with a small group of Los Angeles-based reporters, cheekily standing in front of a USC logo to block it out before taking the first question.\n\u201cYou saw that?\u201d Foster deadpanned to a chuckling reporter.\nAsked how he felt about his opening statement from earlier in the day, Foster playfully cleared his throat.\n\u201cWould you say grand slam or home run?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve got three players here, so I\u2019m going to put them on bases, so that was a grand slam. But no, I just wanted to come out here and just grow. \u2026 I was looking forward to this and I\u2019ve been waiting on this opportunity to come back out here.\u201d\nA few hours before Foster took a few sips of water and dabbed his head with a handkerchief before ascending stairs to the podium inside the Mandalay Bay, his boss predicted that he would have a better showing than he did last year.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just more comfortable,\u201d Jarmond said. \u201cYou know, everybody is new at something and you don\u2019t nail the landing every first time. And so, thankfully, you\u2019re not graded on what you say; you\u2019re graded on how you perform and how you lead, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done exceptionally well. I mean, the last half of the season, we finished 4-2 \u2014 the momentum he had going into the second half of the year and then the recruiting, that\u2019s what matters, what you\u2019re doing with the program.\n\u201cSo I think he\u2019s excited about today. I think he\u2019s going to feel more comfortable because he\u2019s done it before. And that\u2019s just part of the deal. But he\u2019s going to be himself and he\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\nFoster said his verbal stumbles from a year ago taught him a valuable lesson.\nThe agency in charge of regulating NIL deals in college sports sent a letter to schools rejecting some agreements between players and donor-backed collectives.\n\u201cAuthenticity resonates more deeply than perfection,\u201d he said. \u201cOur players saw me being human, and it brought us closer together. We\u2019ve been joking about it for about a year now. The players know that that same genuine approach is how we coach, recruit and build this program.\u201d\nEntering his second season, Foster said he expected significant improvement not just from his team but also from himself.\n\u201cGrowth is part of the process, and we\u2019re all committed to being better than we were last season,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI know there are questions about our progress, expectations and how well we\u2019re performing in this conference. That\u2019s totally fair. We\u2019re here to earn respect, not demand it. However, I can tell you this: My team is ready. They\u2019re confident. They\u2019re prepared, and they\u2019re hungry to show up and show out and redefine what UCLA football can be. So, yes, we\u2019re still in L.A. We\u2019re proud to be Bruins, and we\u2019re ready to make it happen starting now.\u201d\nAnd with that, Foster announced that he was happy to take any questions, having answered a big one about himself."

      "text": "With Dodgers battling more injuries, prospect Alex Freeland called up for MLB debut\n- Share via\nCINCINNATI \u2014 The Dodgers are dealing with more injuries to their lineup.\nAs a result, one of their top prospects will get his first big-league opportunity this week.\nAlex Freeland, the top-ranked infielder in the Dodgers\u2019 farm system, was called up on Tuesday after Hyeseong Kim was placed on the injured list with left shoulder bursitis.\nFreeland\u2019s arrival also comes after Tommy Edman had his lingering ankle injury flare up on him Sunday while rounding the bases.\nOn Monday night, manager Dave Roberts confirmed Freeland was scheduled to join the Dodgers in Cincinnati while they decided which, if either, of Kim or Edman would go on the IL.\nYoshinobu Yamamoto puts on a performance reminiscent of his early-season dominance in the Dodgers\u2019 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to come and we\u2019ll see what direction we go, with who,\u201d Roberts said after the Dodgers\u2019 series-opening win against the Cincinnati Reds. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of trying to figure out ... if we do need to make a move for one of those guys.\u201d\nThe official news came down on Tuesday afternoon. Kim was placed on the IL. Edman, while remaining on the active roster, went through pregame drills on the field with a Dodgers trainer.\nFreeland, a third-round pick in 2022 out of the University of Central Florida, is the team\u2019s No. 3 overall prospect according to MLB Pipeline and the 35th-ranked prospect in baseball.\nThe 23-year-old switch-hitter has spent all season with triple-A Oklahoma City, where he has batted .253 with 12 home runs, 71 RBIs and .799 OPS in 94 games.\nNow, he\u2019ll get his first crack at the big-league roster, trying to help alleviate the Dodgers\u2019 latest injury headache.\nIn the short term, Kim\u2019s shoulder injury was the more pressing issue.\nThe South Korean rookie has struggled mightily at the plate lately, with an 0-for-3 performance Monday leaving him just three for 24 since July 19.\n\u201cYou can just see offensively with the bat, he\u2019s just not himself right now,\u201d Roberts said.\nEdman, however, represents another long-term concern for the Dodgers to manage, with his ankle injury lingering since early May.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of always there,\u201d Edman said. \u201cBut I would say it\u2019s been pretty normal.\u201d\nAt least it was until Sunday, when Edman said he \u201chad a little tweak of it\u201d while running the bases at Fenway Park.\nWhile Edman was not available for Monday\u2019s game, he maintained optimism he could avoid what would be a second injured list this season and be back in the lineup Tuesday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like this is that big a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just at a point where I didn\u2019t feel like I could run full speed today. I got some good treatment today so hopefully I\u2019ll be back available tomorrow.\u201d\nStill, the Dodgers could decide that an extended break for the utilityman is warranted \u2014 especially since he has been unable to play outfield while trying to manage his injury.\n\u201cObviously, if I couldn\u2019t hit him tonight, for him to not to be able to play three innings of defense, isn\u2019t a great feeling,\u201d Roberts said.\nFreeland\u2019s arrival will at least give the Dodgers a different look for the time being.\nThe Dodgers need outfield defensive help, and Minnesota\u2019s Harrison Bader is among the potential players they could target at the MLB trade deadline.\nA native of Louisville, Ken., he made a major jump up the Dodgers\u2019 farm system last year, when he progressed from high A to triple A while batting .260 across three minor-league levels.\nA disciplined hitter with 228 career walks in 345 career minor-league games, Freeland has received high marks for his defense at shortstop and third base. He also has 81 steals over his four minor-league seasons.\nIn addition to Kim and Edman, the Dodgers have spent the last month without Max Muncy (who is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment in his recovery from a knee injury this week) and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (who remains shut down from baseball activity after recently having a couple non-surgical \u201clittle procedures,\u201d as Roberts called them, on an elbow injury that has bothered him since late May).\nHow have the Dodgers toed the line between managing injuries and trying to keep their best players on the field?\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing that, it is a blurred line,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe players obviously feel that they\u2019re not hurt, where they can play and post, which is great. But the line of, are you still hurting the team, hurting yourself, that\u2019s the thing that the organization, the training staff, we\u2019ve got to make that decision.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, they did, shelving Kim and calling up Freeland as they try to navigate another injury-plagued chapter of their season."

      "text": "USC\u2019s Lincoln Riley feeling \u2018refreshed\u2019 as pressure mounts to win in Year 4\n- Share via\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 While the rest of the college football world spent the summer whipped into a frenzy, swept up by the specter of revenue sharing or congressional intervention or one of the many other landscape-altering changes looming over the sport, Lincoln Riley was able to actually step away and take a breath.\nIn four years as USC\u2019s coach, Riley hasn\u2019t had many chances to really unplug. There was the sprint ahead of his first season, and the heavy portal push ahead of his second. The third came with a new conference, new defense, new expectations, new pressure.\nThe fourth, by comparison, is starting on a more relaxed note than Riley is used to. There were no phone calls taking up half a day of his family vacation. His fly fishing went mostly unbothered. He even golfed at Pebble Beach in May.\nThe Trojans\u2019 coach says at Big Ten media day that until the College Football Playoff format is settled, it might be difficult to finalize plans for the rivalry game.\n\u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m feeling as refreshed and recharged as I\u2019ve been in a long time,\u201d Riley said Thursday during Big Ten media days.\nNever mind that the pressure for Riley to win at USC has perhaps never been so high, coming off a 7-6 campaign in which the Trojans needed a comeback bowl win to scrape past .500. The path to winning has arguably never been so uncertain, either, with the advent of revenue sharing completely upending how championship rosters are constructed.\nIn spite of that backdrop, this past summer still felt less daunting to Riley than the rest. He says he didn\u2019t feel the offseason chaos that some of colleagues have described in the wake of the House settlement. Some of that added calm he credits to Chad Bowden, USC\u2019s new general manager, and his handpicked front office, who have taken personnel matters largely off Riley\u2019s plate. Immediately laying claim to the nation\u2019s No. 1 recruiting class for 2026 hasn\u2019t hurt in building that trust, either.\nBut it\u2019s more than that, according to Riley.\n\u201cThere are less big fixes going on right now, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve got the house built, and it\u2019s kind of all about the finishes now. You\u2019re not trying to put up a wall or anything like that.\u201d\nWhether USC is actually that close to being a finished product is up for debate. The Trojans\u2019 win total has declined in each of Riley\u2019s first three seasons, during which his record is worse than that of his predecessor, Clay Helton. Now the Trojans enter his fourth with a raw, unproven commodity at quarterback, a threadbare linebacker room, and an inexperienced offensive line that could already be down a projected starter.\nThere\u2019s also the matter of their fourth-quarter issues last season, which saw the Trojans inexplicably cough up leads in five of their six losses.\nBut Riley looks at it differently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time where we had an opportunity at the end of the game to win every single game that we played,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe really good teams separate in a lot of their games, and they win the close games they end up in. That\u2019s typically how it happens, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to become. And so the way to do it, every part of your program has to be pretty strong.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve graduated from being way behind in this area, and being pretty decent in this area to, like, every right now is either good or pretty darn good. Now it\u2019s just about taking those small steps in all those areas to, I guess, hypothetically push you over the hump.\u201d\nThe biggest leap in that regard could once again be on defense, where USC went from one of the worst units in the nation in 2023 (121st in scoring defense) to respectable (56th) under defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn.\nThat was no small feat, considering where they came from. And the Trojans have added considerable talent to their defense since. The front seven should benefit greatly from the return of linebacker Eric Gentry and defensive end Anthony Lucas from injury. And on the interior, USC brought in two massive transfers on the interior, as well as a five-star freshman.\n\u201cI think the depth, the talent level, and the size of the defensive line, I mean, there\u2019s honestly really no comparison to this time 12 months ago,\u201d Riley said.\nBut the Trojans\u2019 path will inevitably, at some point, come down to their quarterback. Riley reiterated his confidence in Jayden Maiava as the Trojans\u2019 starter, even as he once again heaped praise on five-star freshman Husan Longstreet.\nLeft tackle Elijah Paige said Thursday that he has seen a major change in Maiava since he entered the offseason as the presumptive starter.\nUSC athletics is holding off on cutting any sports and instead has eliminated a dozen jobs as it adapts to new revenue sharing with athletes.\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken a complete 180,\u201d Paige said of USC\u2019s quarterback. \u201c[In the spring,] he commanded the offense, and that\u2019s what this team needs.\u201d\nOf course, everyone is feeling optimistic this time of year, with more than a month still remaining before USC kicks off against Missouri State.\nBut Riley isn\u2019t the only one who feels those finishing touches underway.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone and gotten some of the very best people in the business,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to attach themselves to something where they don\u2019t see the progress.\n\u201cAnd you do not get a recruiting class like this unless there\u2019s a crazy amount of momentum within the program. Like, I don\u2019t care what else you have. If you don\u2019t have momentum, you do not get a class like we have.\u201d"

This is definitely positive progress. \u2026 It certainly is trending in a positive direction for us.\u201d\nStafford, 37, had been sidelined since the start of training camp because of what McVay has described as an aggravated disc. McVay has said that Stafford received an epidural injection a few weeks ago, but on Tuesday he declined to specify if he had received another.\nStafford was not made available to reporters.\nThe Rams\u2019 commitment to investing in SoFi Stadium, along with building a competitive roster, pushed their value to $10.43 billion, according to Sportico.\nRams players welcomed the return of a quarterback who ranks among the NFL\u2019s top 10 in several career passing categories.\n\u201cAny time that man walks into a huddle, he just brings presence,\u201d veteran right tackle Rob Havenstein said Tuesday. \u201cSo it\u2019s great to see him out there doing his thing.\u201d\nStafford has plenty of experience. But \u201crepetition is the mother of learning,\u201d McVay said, so Stafford\u2019s ability to read coverages, feel the pass rush and escape a collapsing pocket at full speed in practice helps him continue to develop.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re Matthew Stafford, whether you\u2019re Steph Curry \u2014 whoever you are,\u201d McVay said. \u201cThese guys get great at their sports by being able to play it.\u201d\nSo McVay is eager for Stafford to take as many reps as possible before the opener.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be just like, I think, a lot of fans and a lot of his teammates and coaches,\u201d McVay said, \u201cthat you\u2019re really hopeful that this is the direction \u2026 so we can build a good foundation and allow him to be the Matthew that we\u2019re accustomed to seeing.\u201d\nEtc.\nLeft tackle Alaric Jackson, who is dealing with blood clot issues, continues to do individual work with trainers. \u201cHis focus and concentration is being ready to go for Week 1,\u201d McVay said, \u201cand that would be a great situation for us if that\u2019s the case.\u201d \u2026 Receiver Davante Adams had a veterans day off from practice."

He participated in a team jogthrough on Wednesday, and then went through a full practice on Thursday.\nThroughout the week, he looked sharp and showed no discernible signs of discomfort or limitations.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a guy that\u2019s gotten better and better,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe looks like the stud that we know.\u201d\nStafford\u2019s availability will be paramount for a team aiming to return to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2021-22 season, when Stafford led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium.\nDuring the offseason, the Rams adjusted Stafford\u2019s contract \u2014 he will carry a salary-cap number of $47.5 million this season, according to Overthecap.com \u2014 because they believe that with the addition of star receiver Davante Adams and a rising defense, they have a shot at another title.\nDuring training camp and joint practices with the Dallas Cowboys and New Orleans Saints, veteran Jimmy Garoppolo took first-team snaps in place of Stafford. Third-year pro Stetson Bennett also made major strides during training camp and two preseason starts.\nYet Stafford\u2019s availability and performance will dictate whether the Rams can improve their performance from last season, when they advanced to the NFC divisional round before losing to the eventual Super Bowl-champion Philadelphia Eagles.\nSo the Rams and Stafford must manage the back issue.\nThe Rams play their final preseason game at Cleveland on Saturday, but Stafford \u2014 and perhaps other veterans \u2014 will not travel, McVay said.\nStafford sounded as if managing this back issue will be nothing new for a quarterback who played through numerous injuries during 12 seasons with the Detroit Lions and four with the Rams.\n\u201cThere\u2019s soreness all over the place, every time I wake up,\u201d he joked. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ll manage like I do a million other things throughout the year.\u201d"

      "text": "Dave Roberts says Dodgers haven\u2019t discussed moving Mookie Betts to right field\n- Share via\nDENVER \u2014 Mookie Betts was back at shortstop and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez remained in right field for the Dodgers on Tuesday, a day after two questionable fielding plays in the outfield led to two runs in a 4-3 walk-off loss to the last-place Colorado Rockies.\nHern\u00e1ndez\u2019s defense has increasingly become a matter of concern for manager Dave Roberts and Monday\u2019s loss was followed by an open-door meeting involving Roberts; Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations; and Betts, who has previously expressed a willingness to move back to right field where he was a six-time Gold Glove winner.\nOn Tuesday, both Betts and Roberts said the discussion was more about Betts\u2019 swing than his defense, characterizing it as nothing out of the ordinary. Roberts said the Dodgers have not discussed moving Betts to right field.\n\u201cI wanted him to check in with me about where he\u2019s at [in] certain checkpoints as we get through the season,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd that was a check in.\u201d\nBut, the manager acknowledged, the Dodgers\u2019 defense remains an issue \u2014 a sacrifice he\u2019s willing to make if it helps the team offensively.\n\u201cAre we playing our best defensive lineup? No,\u201d Roberts continued. \u201cBut I would say there\u2019s very few teams in the big leagues that\u2019s playing their best defensive lineup every night. Even in a postseason race, you\u2019ve still got to score.\u201d\nHern\u00e1ndez is ranked 64th among National League right fielders with a defensive WAR of -0.4 and his two errors are tied for fourth-most in the league.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to get better out there. There\u2019s just no way to put it,\u201d Roberts said after Monday\u2019s game of Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lack of effort. But, you know, we\u2019ve just got to kind of get better. We do.\u201d\nBetts, meanwhile, twice led the American League in fielding average and putouts as the Boston Red Sox\u2019s right fielder. But he\u2019s played shortstop full-time this season.\n\u201cDefense is a big part of postseason baseball and winning baseball,\u201d Roberts said.\nBetts\u2019 move to the infield has arguably weakened the Dodgers in two ways: Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s defense and Betts\u2019 offense. Playing the infield, especially shortstop, is far more taxing mentally than playing in the outfield and Betts is slashing a career-low .242/.312/.370 this season.\nAfter Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez makes two costly mistakes in right field in the Dodgers\u2019 4-3 loss to Colorado, Mookie Betts meets with Dave Roberts and Andrew Friedman.\nIf the Dodgers chose to pursue moving Betts back to right field now, it would likely mean using Alex Freeland or Miguel Rojas at shortstop, at least in the short term. Freeland played nearly 300 games at shortstop in the minors while Rojas has played more than 940 games there in the majors.\nHern\u00e1ndez, second on the team with 74 RBIs and tied for second with 20 home runs, would then move to left field \u2014 a less-demanding position defensively than right field \u2014 in place of Michael Conforto, whose .190 batting average is the worst in the majors among players with at least 300 at-bats.\nMoving Betts back to the outfield could be easier for Roberts when utility players Tommy Edman, Hyeseong Kim and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez return from the injured list, giving the manager more depth and flexibility. Kim, who will begin a rehab assignment this week, is the furthest along and could be back by early next week."

      "text": "\u2018I just don\u2019t want to let down this team\u2019: Ikaika Malloe is driven to fix UCLA\u2019s defense\n- Share via\nIt started as the same unremarkable sequence that materializes dozens of times a season on UCLA\u2019s football practice field, a coach lingering to speak with reporters and engage in the usual give and take.\nQuestions were asked about simplifying the defense and putting more pressure on the quarterback. Answers were given about accountability, attention to detail and putting the right defenders in position to make plays.\nThen the coach started blinking tears, his voice catching, his words a chore. Everything routine about the exchange transformed into something else entirely.\n\u201cYou know, I love this defense because I feel like part of them,\u201d defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe began Tuesday, still holding it together. \u201cThey work so hard to try to give me what I want, you know, and so, on the flip side just, man, I can\u2019t \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve been up since 3 o\u2019clock on Sunday because I just don\u2019t want to let down this team.\nUCLA quarterback Ethan Garbers didn\u2019t practice Monday, but coach DeShaun Foster is somewhat optimistic about Garbers playing against Penn State.\n\u201cThese kids fight hard, man,\u201d Malloe continued, now struggling to keep his composure, \u201cand so I think the love for each other, that\u2019s what keeps us going. But fundamentally, technically, that\u2019s my job. I just got to get these kids better so we can win.\u201d\nAnd with that, Malloe bid farewell and headed back inside the practice facility to continue his efforts to revitalize a defense that\u2019s been a bunch of blah since a talented cast of edge rushers departed for the NFL and the man in charge headed across town to USC.\nThe scene revealed the passion and commitment that made a handful of players champion Malloe as Chip Kelly\u2019s replacement when the Bruins coach bolted for Ohio State in February. Malloe (pronounced mull-OY) happily remained in his new role as defensive coordinator once UCLA pivoted to DeShaun Foster, staying in character for someone who has spent more than a quarter of a century quietly making a name for himself.\n\u201cOnce coach Kelly left,\u201d Malloe said in the spring, \u201cI thought that [Foster] was the best possible answer we could have.\u201d\nFinding solutions for a depleted defense would prove far more difficult. Laiatu Latu went in the first round of the NFL draft to the Indianapolis Colts. Fellow edge rusher Grayson Murphy ended up with the Miami Dolphins and his twin Gabriel Murphy with the Minnesota Vikings. Linebacker Darius Muasau went to the New York Giants.\nThose weren\u2019t the only losses. Defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn took star safety Kamari Ramsey and cornerback John Humphrey with him to USC.\nThat left largely a collection of transfers and career backups to man a defense that has put little pressure on the quarterback. The Bruins (1-3 overall, 0-2 Big Ten) have logged zero sacks over their last three games heading into a Saturday showdown against seventh-ranked Penn State (4-0, 1-0) at Beaver Stadium in State College, Pa.\n\u201cWe had four missed sacks in the last game,\u201d Malloe said, referring to UCLA\u2019s 34-13 loss to Oregon. \u201cPartly it\u2019s due to the athlete that was on the other side of the ball, but partly it\u2019s due to not paying attention to details in terms of executing. So, again, I take full responsibility for that. You know, I gotta find a way to generate a pass rush.\u201d\nMalloe has tinkered with personnel and scheme. He moved Oluwafemi Oladejo from linebacker to edge rusher. He changed Luke Schuermann\u2019s role from more of a run stopper to a pass rusher. He put Cherif Seye on the field as much as possible once the edge rusher had fully rounded into form from an injury.\nNone of it has made an appreciable difference.\nUCLA ranks No. 98 nationally in total defense (398.2 yards allowed per game), No. 104 in scoring defense (an average of 30.8 points given up) and No. 133 \u2014 dead last \u2014 in third-down conversion defense (allowing opponents to succeed on 58.2% of their chances).\nUCLA couldn\u2019t generate a pass rush or do much in the running game, helping No. 8 Oregon run away with a 34-13 win at the Rose Bowl on Saturday night.\nStriking a different tone from his boss, who has pinned the team\u2019s shortcomings on a lack of execution, Malloe said the failures should be traced back to the coaching staff.\n\u201cThe players win games,\u201d Malloe said, \u201cbut if we\u2019re losing that has to come back to us and all the responsibility comes back to us \u2014 from film study to how do we get better, game plan, for sure, and then most importantly, like the eye discipline, the techniques, the fundamentals, we can improve on that. I think that gives us a better chance to win.\u201d\nSurprisingly, given its massive personnel losses, UCLA\u2019s defense hasn\u2019t been the biggest culprit for a team averaging 14.8 points per game, the sixth-lowest figure in major college football. Against Oregon, the Bruins\u2019 defense outscored its offense. Safety Bryan Addison stepped in front of a Dillon Gabriel pass and returned the interception 96 yards for the Bruins\u2019 only touchdown of the game.\nMeanwhile, UCLA\u2019s offense produced two field goals and just as many turnovers.\n\u201cWe kind of put them in a couple of unfortunate situations,\u201d Foster said of his defensive players. \u201cBut I think the defense is doing a good job \u2014 guys are still playing hard. You know, the interception before the half really gave us some juice and some life and hopefully we can continue to build off that.\u201d\nMalloe, who turned 50 last summer, has a history of making the best out of whatever he has to work with. After starting his playing career as a walk-on at Washington, the safety and outside linebacker went on to help Huskies win a share of the Pac-10 title in 1995 by making a team-high five interceptions.\nHis coaching stops have included Texas El-Paso, Hawaii, Yale, Utah State and Portland State, outposts not exactly known as a launching point for careers. After returning to his alma mater as defensive line coach before the 2016 season and immediately helping the Huskies reach the College Football Playoff, he earned a promotion to co-defensive coordinator in 2020.\nMalloe\u2019s reputation as a player\u2019s coach was bolstered when he brought Latu with him to Westwood before the 2022 season, serving not only as a mentor but also a surrogate father to the edge rusher who was waiting to be medically cleared after a serious neck injury.\n\u201cOh, a huge peace of mind,\u201d Latu\u2019s mother, Kerry, told The Times last year when asked what it meant to have Malloe remain near her son, \u201cbecause I know what kind of man coach Malloe is \u2014 he\u2019s a family man and he\u2019s genuine and I know he really, really cares about my son.\u201d\nLatu is among Malloe\u2019s former players who have returned the favor, sending messages of encouragement.\n\u201cThey keep telling me, \u2018Just keep grinding, coach, just keep grinding,\u2019 \u201d Malloe said. \u201cBut that is my work ethic. You know, you always feel like you wish you could get something \u2014 the accomplishments you want \u2014 based on your work ethic. But it doesn\u2019t happen that way in this game, you know, it really doesn\u2019t. You just never know how the ball falls and, for me, the only thing I do know is to try to outwork somebody else. So, that\u2019s what I plan to do.\u201d\nLike a teacher changing his approach for a struggling student, Malloe said he would simplify the way he explained concepts and make sure the fundamentals applied to every situation. He relayed an anecdote involving his son\u2019s baseball coach to illustrate the importance of reminders.\nWhen his son was on first base, Malloe said, the coach always told him to run to second base whenever the ball was put in play on the ground but hold up halfway if the ball was hit into the air. Asking if the players should know that by now, the coach responded that the New York Yankees\u2019 first base coach gave the same reminder to star shortstop Derek Jeter every time he reached first base.\n\u201cI\u2019ve carried that with me,\u201d Malloe said, \u201cthat I don\u2019t think you can say it enough times.\u201d\nCarter Shaw always wanted to play for his father, former Stanford coach David Shaw, but he\u2019s making the most of his college football experience at UCLA.\nPlenty will need to come together for the Bruins to meet the challenge of facing a smashmouth Big Ten team like the Nittany Lions, who average 496.9 yards of offense to rank No. 11 in the nation. Among other things, Malloe said he intended to free star defensive tackle Jay Toia from the double teams he\u2019s faced on a weekly basis so that he can make plays and ensure the Bruins\u2019 coverage can hold up whenever it blitzes.\n\u201cWe gotta put up or shut up, I will say that,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cWe gotta show that we can play the physicality football that is expected from this school entering that conference.\u201d\nWin or lose, his players appear to be sticking with him. Watching Malloe speak from behind the small group of reporters, Addison said he appreciated the devotion to getting better.\n\u201cCoach Malloe\u2019s just one of those coaches that\u2019s easy to play for,\u201d Addison said. \u201cHe\u2019s so passionate about his players and his defense that he takes pride in what he does and what he teaches us, so to see him acting like that and seeing how passionate he is about the game, it just makes me fired up and wanting to go play for him.\u201d"

      "text": "Top USC receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane cleared to play after breaking his foot during offseason\n- Share via\nRising star USC wideout Ja\u2019Kobi Lane suffered a broken foot in May, but was fully cleared this week and will be ready for the Trojans\u2019 season opener against Missouri State, coach Lincoln Riley said Thursday.\nThe foot injury kept Lane limited through most of the summer. By the start of preseason camp, he was still being brought along slowly. During the portion of USC\u2019s practices open to reporters, Lane wasn\u2019t even running routes on air.\nThrough the first two weeks of preseason football camp, he established himself as one of the early standouts in a crowded cornerback group.\nLane wasn\u2019t deemed fully healthy until the final week of USC\u2019s preseason camp. Riley said that the junior wideout had actually \u201cprogressed a little bit ahead of schedule.\u201d\nHis return is a welcomed one on a USC offense that will rely on him to stretch the field this season. Lane was second in the Big Ten in receiving touchdowns last season as a sophomore, with 12 scores on just 43 receptions. He finished the year with six touchdowns across his final two games, a dominant stretch that would put him in the conversation to be a first-round pick in next spring\u2019s NFL draft.\nBut after sitting out for part of the offseason, it may take some time to see that final leap from Lane as a junior. Riley said that Lane is still getting back into shape after being limited by his foot injury, but is progressing nicely with just over a week remaining before USC kicks off at the Coliseum.\n\u201cYou can see some of the rust starting to get knocked off now,\u201d Riley said of his top wideout.\nUSC coach Lincoln Riley is doing all he can to stay relaxed and refreshed as he prepares to enter what will be a critical year for him and the Trojans."

      "text": "- Share via\nDemetrice Martin built an early, practically insurmountable lead.\nLanding six defensive backs by Christmas, the UCLA secondary coach added two more before the spring transfer portal window closed, making this race appear to be a runaway.\nBefore long, a formidable challenger emerged. Closing fast in the battle to become the Bruins\u2019 top recruiter on an almost entirely new coaching staff was Andy Kwon.\nHaving helped snag four transfers \u2014 a few of whom committed before his hiring \u2014 the offensive line coach went on to secure verbal commitments from two four-star high school prospects from Florida, the kind of highly coveted out-of-region talent that UCLA had seen go elsewhere in recent years.\nA judge denies injunction requests from DJ Wingfield and Kaedin Robinson in their NCAA lawsuits, all but blocking them from playing for USC and UCLA this fall.\nThe heated duel to see who could secure the best players, which included every new assistant and holdovers Ikaika Malloe and Jerry Neuheisel, was a welcome surprise to coach DeShaun Foster.\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I didn\u2019t know they were going to compete about the recruiting the way that they\u2019re doing,\u201d Foster said recently of his new assistants. \u201cI knew that they like to recruit, but they\u2019re competing.\u201d\nSo who\u2019s atop the leaderboard?\n\u201cMeat came out of the blocks hot for a little bit,\u201d Foster said, referring to Martin\u2019s nickname, \u201cand then Andy came in, so I\u2019m gonna think right now it\u2019s Andy, and then coach Meat.\u201d\nAlong the way, the assistants understood that crossing the finish line first meant they would be helping everybody win.\nUCLA\u2019s 2026 recruiting class that is ranked No. 22 nationally by 247Sports.com is on pace to become the Bruins\u2019 best since they finished No. 19 in 2018, the latter success largely a result of the efforts of the staff that was in place before coach Chip Kelly\u2019s arrival.\n\u201cIf they win some games this year and look competitive,\u201d said Greg Biggins, a national recruiting analyst for 247Sports.com, \u201cthey could really have a legitimate top-20 recruiting class.\u201d\nKwon and Martin faced plenty of worthy competition in their bid to reach the top. Safeties coach Gabe Lynn offered a huge assist in helping Martin restock the secondary. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Tino Sunseri aided Foster and others in the acquisition of Nico Iamaleava, the biggest catch of the spring. Running backs coach A.J. Steward and wide receivers coach Burl Toler III were part of a combined effort to bring in tailback Jaivian Thomas, the prized transfer tailback from California who knew Toler when Toler was an assistant with the Golden Bears.\nOn it went, the entire staff working to outdo one another in service of the team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome,\u201d said Malloe, the defensive coordinator who helped defensive line coach Jethro Franklin import four transfers. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like the whole, you know, who wants to win the knife set, right? Who\u2019s gonna get that prize? And I think our coaching staff is so competitive that as a byproduct of it, we\u2019re starting to bring in guys that really fit our culture and then talent-wise, we\u2019re bringing in guys that I think we\u2019re thankful for.\u201d\nThe expected payoff from the next high school class is more than a decent season ending in a bowl game; the Bruins are vying for something unprecedented.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to get a playoff run with my class,\u201d said Cooper Javorsky, an offensive lineman from San Juan Hills High who committed in June, \u201cso the image I have being in my head is with my class, we\u2019re going to try to do great things and take it as far as we can.\u201d\nJavorsky is one of three offensive linemen in the class alongside tackle Johnnie Jones and interior offensive lineman Micah Smith, the four-star Floridians. Biggins cautioned that players from the East Coast can be hard to hold onto \u2014 Jones has reportedly scheduled a visit to Florida State for the Seminoles\u2019 season opener against Alabama.\n\u201cI always say that there\u2019s a danger in recruiting out of region because it\u2019s harder to babysit those guys,\u201d Biggins said, \u201cand you\u2019ve got to know that those local schools out there are going to stay on those guys the whole entire year, and if UCLA starts to slip up a little bit, then those schools are going to be all over them.\u201d\nIf Jones and Smith crave honest critiques about what they need to do to live up to their billing, maybe they\u2019ll stick with their commitments. Kwon has developed a reputation as a straight shooter who isn\u2019t afraid to sling some verbal darts in his efforts to maximize players\u2019 talent.\n\u201cHe was very honest with me, you know, he wasn\u2019t lying to me about anything, he spoke to me exactly how it was,\u201d Javorsky said. \u201cLike, when I went on my official [visit], he wasn\u2019t just hyping me up and all that, he was telling me stuff I did wrong and stuff he\u2019s going to help me fix.\u201d\nJavorsky\u2019s to-do list? Staying low in his blocks and developing proper hand placement and footwork will be top priorities upon his enrollment before spring practice in 2026. Guard Julian Armella, a transfer from Florida State who projects as one of at least three new starters on the offensive line, said it\u2019s common for players to stay after practice or meet individually with Kwon to perfect their technique.\nAs part of coach DeShaun Foster\u2019s efforts to connect a team featuring 55 new players and eight new assistant coaches, everyone participated in brotherhood meetings.\nAs far as Martin\u2019s recruiting success goes, these are far from the first wins he\u2019s logged in Westwood. The veteran has nearly attained legendary status after being part of a staff that brought in six consecutive top-20 recruiting classes under coach Jim Mora. A personable demeanor that helps him relate to players, parents and high school coaches is among Martin\u2019s biggest assets.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fun to talk to, he\u2019s high-energy, he\u2019s easy to talk with, he\u2019s very intelligent,\u201d Biggins said. \u201cSo if you want to talk scheme, you can do that. If you want to talk \u2014 coaches nowadays, you always hear kids saying, \u2018Hey, we talked forever and it wasn\u2019t even about football\u2019 \u2014 he can do that, too.\u201d\nUCLA did not make either Martin or Kwon available to discuss their recruiting accomplishments despite repeated requests since the start of training camp July 30. But those who have interacted with the assistants had plenty to say about the root of their success.\nJustin Lewis, a cornerback from Rancho Cucamonga High, credited Martin\u2019s relentlessness.\n\u201cHe was on me nonstop,\u201d said Lewis, who flipped his commitment from North Carolina to UCLA as soon as the Bruins offered him a scholarship, \u201cso it was pretty hard to say no to him with all the things he was telling me with what he was letting me know and how he was telling me they would be able to use me.\u201d\nTransfers and high school recruits alike have also pointed to the family atmosphere cultivated by Foster, who hosted prospects at his home over five weekends in May and June. After sinking a jumper from well beyond the three-point arc on the basketball goal in his yard, Foster took a victory lap around his pool with one finger held aloft as part of a sequence that led to the commitment of high school defensive lineman Yahya Gaad.\n\u201cThey told me if I hit this jumper, I\u2019m gonna get a commit,\u201d said Foster, careful not to mention any unsigned recruits by name. \u201cWent up there, hit the \u2018J\u2019 and he committed.\u201d\nFor the Bruins to have the breakthrough they\u2019re seeking, here are 10 players who must step up for UCLA to succeed in 2025.\nSome might point out that UCLA\u2019s 2026 high school class ranks only seventh in the Big Ten \u2014 behind top-ranked USC, Oregon, Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State and Washington, according to 247Sports.com \u2014 but Biggins said the Bruins\u2019 talent haul is good enough to help them compete with their conference brethren.\n\u201cThe teams with the most talent win the most games and that\u2019s always been proven,\u201d Biggins said. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t win if you have the seventh-ranked recruiting class because it still comes down to coaching and development, and that\u2019s always going to be a huge factor. So you want to have guys that when you put them on the same field, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re playing different sports.\n\u201cI think a couple of years ago, you looked at the sideline and you looked at them and other schools and you\u2019re going, OK, this is like the JV going against the varsity. So I think if you bring in comparable talent, which UCLA is, then you\u2019ve got a chance to win; now it\u2019s scheme and coaching and development.\u201d\nAfter years of seemingly jogging in place, the Bruins could be in the running for something special thanks in large part to the assistants who ran their own race."
