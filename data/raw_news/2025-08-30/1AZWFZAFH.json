      "text": "Sabrina Carpenter reveals alternative album cover \u2018approved by God\u2019 amid backlash\n- Share via\nSabrina Carpenter divided fans earlier this month with her choice of cover art for her forthcoming album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend.\u201d Playing on the title, she poses on all fours like a dog while a faceless man pulls her hair.\nWhile some interpreted the cover as cheeky and ironic \u2014 especially given the themes of the album\u2019s first single, \u201cManchild\u201d \u2014 others accused the former Disney Channel star of promoting sexist stereotypes and setting women\u2018s rights back decades.\nCarpenter has addressed criticism by releasing an alternative cover \u201capproved by God,\u201d the singer revealed Wednesday on Instagram.\nThe black-and-white image seemingly channels Marilyn Monroe as the singer, dressed in an elegant beaded gown, leans against a man in a suit. Carpenter is front and center while the man\u2018s face is partially hidden.\nSabrina Carpenter\u2019s forthcoming album, \u2018Man\u2019s Best Friend,\u2019 is set to be released Aug. 29.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Carpenter has ruffled some feathers.\nIn 2023, she received backlash from the Catholic Church after she filmed parts of her \u201cFeather\u201d music video at the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church. The Diocese of Brooklyn said it was \u201cappalled\u201d by the nature of the video and the priest who allowed her to film there was removed from his administrative duties.\nWhen asked about the incident in an interview with Variety, Carpenter responded, \u201cJesus was a carpenter.\u201d She doubled down during her Coachella debut in 2024, wearing a shirt with the same phrase.\nThe singer has also raised eyebrows on her Short n\u2019 Sweet Tour, which returns to North America this fall. During her sultry performance of \u201cJuno,\u201d she acts out a different sex position every night.\nCarpenter addressed the criticism that she\u2019s shaped her entire brand around sex in her June cover story with Rolling Stone.\nSabrina Carpenter\u2019s music video for \u201cFeather\u201d was shot in a Catholic church in New York City. The priest who allowed the filming was stripped of his administrative duties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always funny to me when people complain,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018All she does is sing about this.\u2019 But those are the songs that you\u2019ve made popular. Clearly you love sex. You\u2019re obsessed with it. It\u2019s in my show. There\u2019s so many more moments than the \u2018Juno\u2019 positions, but those are the ones you post every night and comment on. I can\u2019t control that.\u201d\nIn a since-deleted post, an X user shared the first \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d cover and asked, \u201cDoes she have a personality outside of sex?\u201d Carpenter responded, \u201cGirl yes and it is goooooood.\u201d\nAmong those who came to Carpenter\u2019s defense of the original album art was \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain\u201d singer Carly Simon, who received backlash for the cover of her 1975 album, \u201cPlaying Possum.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not doing anything outrageous,\u201d Simon told Rolling Stone. \u201cIt seems tame. There have been far flashier covers than hers. One of the most startling covers I\u2019ve ever seen was [the Rolling Stones\u2019] \u2018Sticky Fingers.\u2019 That was out there in terms of sexual attitude. So I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s getting such flak.\u201d\n\u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d will be released Aug. 29, a little over a year after Carpenter\u2019s last project, \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet.\u201d Signed editions and copies with the alternative cover are available for preorder on her website."
