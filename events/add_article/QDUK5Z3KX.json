      "summary": "Société Générale strategist Albert Edwards cautions that the tech sector now accounts for 37% of the U.S. market—higher than the dot‑com peak—and that its low free‑cash‑flow and dividend yields signal a bubble. He argues that rising U.S. and Japanese bond yields will eventually erode the rally, while the current low equity risk premium and high CAPE ratio leave the market vulnerable to a pullback. Edwards notes that the end of the yen‑carry trade could trigger capital outflows from U.S. equities, adding to downside risk. Despite his bearish tone, he remains upbeat in person and sees his views as a reality check for investors.",
