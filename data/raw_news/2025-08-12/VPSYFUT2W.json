  "title": "5 AI Stocks Struggle To Hit New Highs: And Fail To Get There",
  "description": "Nvidia and Palantir hit new highs: what's the problem with the stocks in the rest of the AI sector? These ones are underperforming.",
  "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks are said to be the next big thing. That may be true but once you go beyond the successes of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, it\u2019s tougher now than it\u2019s been. With those two hitting new highs today and the Nasdaq 100 hitting new highs, why are these other AI names not quite following the lead lately?\n\nHas the bloom come off the artificial intelligence rose?\n\nIt\u2019s odd to see this AI ETF fail to make a new high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 make it up to their new highs today. Up until August, this price had followed the indexes upward. Not anymore. Following the July 31 stock market sell-off, the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence exchange traded fund is underperforming.\n\nThis OTC-traded stock makes up 3% of the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF portfolio. Market cap is $59.37 billion. The Tokyo-based Advantest makes semiconductors. The tech firm\u2019s annual growth rate over the last five years is reported to be 43%. The red-dotted line indicates \u201clack of new high.\u201d\n\nThe company using the symbol \u201cAI\u201d has one of the sector\u2019s worst looking charts. In December 2024, it traded at above $44 and now goes for $16.91. C3.ai this month took out the previous low from April, designated on this chart by the lower red-dotted line. Earnings this year are down by 23% and down over the past five years by 25%.\n\nAfter trading at above $205 in February and dipping down to $140, the stock that is still commonly referred to as Google, now trades at $203. That\u2019s lower than February even with the gap down now filled (red circled). Market cap is $2462 billion. It\u2019s a component of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, both of which hit new highs today.\n\nFrom the February high of near $66 to the present $46 amounts to a 30% slide. The rally from the April low looked good until the July 31 stock market sell-off. A few days after that Super Micro Computer gapped down after an earnings miss. The company that refers to itself as \u201can AI data center infrastructure total solution\u201d has a market cap of $27.71 billion.\n\nThe stock hit $155 in January, dropped in April to just below $60 and almost recovered in late July with a $153 trading range high. Vertive now trades for $143 making it another AI stock failing to keep up with today\u2019s new highs for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. The company calls itself \u201ca global leader in critical digital infrastructure.\u201d\n\nWhat has happend to all of the previous enthusiasm for this persistently hyped sector? Some former buyers seem to be holding back now.\n\nNo artificial intelligence was used in the writing of this post.\n\nMore analysis and commentary at johnnavin.substack.com.",

      "text": "is for Google\nAs Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, \u201cGoogle is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one\u201d\nAs part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make \u201csmaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.\u201d From the start, we\u2019ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have.\nWe did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven\u2019t stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about.\nWe\u2019ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant.\nOur company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President.\nWhat is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren\u2019t very related.\nAlphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We\u2019ll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we\u2019ll determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.\nThis new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I\u2019ve been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation\u2014continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world\u2019s information. Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress. Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth.\nSergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure.\nAlphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG.\nFor Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google\u2014the birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity\u2019s most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha-bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for! I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products\u2014the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.\nWe are excited about\u2026\n- Getting more ambitious things done.\n- Taking the long-term view.\n- Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish.\n- Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see.\n- Improving the transparency and oversight of what we\u2019re doing.\n- Making Google even better through greater focus.\n- And hopefully\u2026 as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.\nWhat could be better? No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re still getting used to the name too!"
