  "description": "Just over six months in, this Congress has witnessed all-nighters, extra-long votes and flaring personalities.",
  "content": "\u201cI will say again - I am tired of making history. I just want (a) normal Congress,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said.\n\nHis comments to reporters in early July came as the House concluded a more than seven-hour vote, then the longest in the chamber\u2019s history (a milestone hit after the chamber had already broken the record a week earlier).\n\nOf course, the increasingly partisan, combative, and at times, chaotic atmosphere had infiltrated the modern Congress before Johnson or his Senate counterpart, Majority Leader John Thune, took the gavel.\n\nBut more than six months in, the 119th Congress has seen its share of unusual or unprecedented moments, from extraordinarily long votes to all-nighter sessions.\n\nHere's a look at some of the notable moments of the not \"normal\" kickoff for the 119th.\n\nHouse lawmakers this year first surpassed the record for the longest House vote while deliberating President Donald Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d on July 2.\n\nThe vote was held open for seven hours and 23 minutes.\n\nMembers of Congress filtered in and out of the chamber, mostly congregating off the floor for deals and debates. But someone, by rule, had to supervise the chamber.\n\nWomack, a Republican, had the task of presiding over the floor starting at 11:45 a.m. and staying at the dais well into the evening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m told he is very very bored,\u201d NBC\u2019s Melanie Zanona posted at the time, \u201cand singing the Eric Carmen song \u2018ALL BY MYSELF\u2019 to himself.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, had his own way of killing time.\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d Cole said, when a reporter asked him, around 5 p.m., how many cigars he had so far that day.\n\n\u201cIs that a lot or a little?\u201d one reporter followed up.\n\nSenators also have plenty of time-consuming accomplishments to boast about, were such efforts to be lauded.\n\nThe upper chamber kicked off July by barely topping a record set in 2008 for the longest \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d \u2013 Washington parlance for a marathon series of votes on amendments to budget bills.\n\nEarlier this summer, Democrats were responsible for the bulk of the 45 proposals to revise Trump\u2019s sweeping tax, spending and policy bill.\n\nIt was one more amendment than what senators almost two decades ago had spent hours voting on.\n\nThe chamber has had three cases of a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d so far this year.\n\nOften, they mean overnight sessions that stretch more than a dozen hours.\n\nThe series in early July was an unusual daylight occurrence, though, beginning a little after 9 a.m. on a Monday and lasting past noon the next day.\n\nAfter being elected majority leader by his colleagues, Thune promised more working days for a body of government that many Americans accuse of being allergic to work.\n\nThat mostly meant adding Fridays to the work calendar (though the chamber has been about 50-50 on coming in those Fridays).\n\nMore recently, there was talk of scrapping senators\u2019 typical summer break and instead staying in town to plow through a backlogged agenda.\n\nSome congressional correspondents who'd worked through the session thus far weren't so sure about the idea.\n\n\u201cThe Senate really, really needs a recess,\u201d senior HuffPost Igor Bobic wrote online.\n\nBut after a Saturday slog Aug. 2, lawmakers finally called it and fled the capital for their home states.\n\nThe House and Senate are both set to return to town Sept. 2.\n\nAnd with a deadline to keep the government funded looming at the end of the month, a broiling debate over Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s case files ongoing, and overall tensions still simmering, Speaker Johnson and the rest of the legislative branch are not likely to see a \u201cnormal Congress\u201d anytime soon.",

      "text": "Which way will Senate swing in 2026? Here are 11 pivotal races that will decide.\nFrom the South to the Great Lakes, contested primaries and open Senate seat battles will determine who's serving for President Trump's last two years.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's agenda in the second half of his second term will hinge on whether Republicans can maintain control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.\nIn the Senate, where the GOP has a slim 53-47 majority, being the party in charge is vital for the president and his ability to pass key legislation priorities and confirm nominees, including any potential Supreme Court vacancies.\nHeading into 2026, congressional Republicans look to keep their legislative advantage but face the challenge of precedent. Often, the party that does not hold the White House fares better in midterm congressional elections. In need of a pick-me-up after last year\u2019s bruising presidential and congressional elections, Democrats are trying to flip the upper chamber back to blue by winning a handful of states scattered from the South to the Great Lakes.\nFor their part, Republicans trying to defend their majority in next November\u2019s races must first weather some base-splitting primaries in which established GOP incumbents hope to hold on against challengers from inside their own party.\nHere are 11 Senate races to watch across the country heading into the 2026 midterm elections.\n1. North Carolina\nNorth Carolina\u2019s two-term senior senator, Republican Thom Tillis, announced in June that he would not be seeking reelection.\nHis news, which Tillis called \u201cnot a hard choice,\u201d came as debates over Trump\u2019s sweeping tax, spending and policy bill engulfed Congress and pitted Republicans against one another.\nThe news was music to Democrats\u2019 ears.\nAlready a top target for the liberal party in next year\u2019s midterms, the North Carolina race was set to be one of the most competitive Senate battles in 2026, even with Tillis on the ballot.\nNow, the open seat has attracted high-profile contenders on both sides of the aisle.\nFormer North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, announced his campaign formally on July 28 after weeks of speculation.\nOn the Republican side, Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law and former co-chair of the Republican National Committee, said she considered jumping in. But after she announced July 24 that she would not run for the seat, President Trump gave his backing to Republican National Committee chair and former North Carolina GOP Chair Michael Whatley.\nPrimary elections will be held March 3.\n2. Michigan\nIn Michigan, another retiring incumbent has set the stage for a toss-up race next year.\nSen. Gary Peters, a Democrat, announced in January that he would not seek a third term representing the Great Lakes State in the Senate.\nHis absence leaves the race open for either party's taking.\nRepublican Mike Rogers, a former congressman with Trump\u2019s endorsement, is his party\u2019s expected nominee. Rogers ran in 2024 and lost narrowly to Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin.\nAmong Democrats, Rep. Haley Stevens and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow lead the pack of 2026 candidates. Primary elections in the state will be held Aug. 4.\n3. Georgia\nGeorgia\u2019s Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff must fend off a pack of conservative lawmakers to hang on to his seat in 2026.\nAlongside fellow Georgia Democrat Sen. Raphael Warnock, Ossoff won a runnoff election in January 2021 that secured him a first term in Congress and his party a chamber majority.\nOnce again, his race will be key in determining whether Democrats win control of the Senate.\nRepublicans looking to unseat him include Rep. Buddy Carter, a former pharmacist who represents the Savannah area.\nCarter was first to throw his red hat in the ring. But others, including Rep. Mike Collins, have since joined the contest. Carter and Collins are coveting Trump's support, an endorsement that could carry weight with Georgia\u2019s deep-red electorate pockets.\nGeorgia's primary elections are set for May 19.\n4. Texas\nTexas Republican Sen. John Cornyn stands a good chance of winning a fifth term against a Democratic challenger next November in the red-leaning Lone Star State.\nBut first, he must make it through what is promising to be a tough primary against the state\u2019s attorney general, Ken Paxton.\nCornyn has served in the Senate since 2002, but early polls showed him down double digits to Paxton.\nNational Republicans have expressed concern that Paxton, who has faced indictments, impeachment and, more recently, a very public divorce, could cost the GOP their safely held Texas seat in a general election.\nDemocrat and former Rep. Colin Allred, who ran unsuccessfully against Sen. Ted Cruz in 2024, has announced his campaign for 2026. Texas state Rep. James Talarico has said he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a run as well.\nPrimary elections in the Lone Star State are set for March 3.\n5. South Carolina\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, has also drawn a GOP challenger in his 2026 bid for reelection.\nPaul Dans, the original author of Project 2025, a sweeping conservative agenda to overhaul the federal government, announced his candidacy at an event in Charleston July 30.\nThe primary contest will likely pit MAGA voters in the Palmetto State against one another.\nThough Graham has been a regular target of criticism from Trump \u2212 displeased by the lawmaker at times breaking from the GOP leader \u2212 he is now an ally to the president and has already received Trump's \u201ccomplete and total endorsement.\u201d\nDans' primary challenge will be an uphill battle. Should Graham come out on top, he is heavily favored to win a fifth term representing the Palmetto State.\nA pack of Democrats are vying to face Graham or Dans in the general, though South Carolina is generally considered a safely red seat. Both party primaries will be held June 9.\n6. Maine\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is about to wrap her fifth term in the Senate, and while she has yet to formally announce her bid for reelection, many colleagues expect her to run again.\nHer position as one of the upper chamber\u2019s most independent voices has kept her in favor, and in office, with her left-leaning state, though Democrats still see this upcoming race as one of their top pickup opportunities if two-term Gov. Janet Mills decides to run.\nCollins has garnered a reputation for being one of the few congressional Republicans willing to tell Trump no. She voted against two of his major legislative priorities this summer \u2013 a sweeping tax and spending bill, as well as a $9 billion cut to public broadcasting and foreign aid funding \u2013 and has openly criticized some of the president\u2019s nominees.\nWillingness to oppose Trump typically comes with the president\u2019s full public ire \u2013 and often a MAGA-aligned primary opponent.\nBut Collins is the only Republican senator to have won a state in which Democrats won the popular vote in 2024. Her unique position seems to, at least for now, have kept Trump from speaking out against who many view as the GOP\u2019s best chance to keep their seat in Maine.\nSeveral Democratic candidates have announced campaigns against Collins, including David Costello, who ran unsuccessfully against Maine\u2019s Independent Sen. Angus King in 2024. All eyes are most focused on Mills, the state governor who has also tussled with Trump but hasn't yet said whether she will run. Maine will have its primaries on June 9.\n7. Minnesota\nMinnesota's Democratic Sen. Tina Smith announced earlier this year that she plans to retire at the end of her term, calling the decision \"entirely personal.\"\nWith the state's blue tilt, Smith's seat has a good chance of staying in Democrats' hands.\nMinnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Annie Craig are among the front-runners for their party's nomination. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' running mate, opted back in February not to run for the Senate.\nOn the Republican side, former NBA player Royce White is running again after losing his bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar in 2024. Former Navy SEAL Adam Schwarze has also announced his campaign for the GOP nomination. The Minnesota primaries will be held Aug. 11.\n8. Ohio\nThe Buckeye State represents one of Democrats' few pickup opportunities, and even then it will not be an easy flip.\nRepublican Sen. Jon Husted was picked by Ohio's governor to fill the seat vacated by Vice President JD Vance at the start of the year, and Husted will be on the ballot next November to keep his spot.\nOhio has become reliably red in recent years, making the fight to flip it tough for Democrats.\nTheir best shot probably is former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost his bid for reelection last year to Sen. Bernie Moreno. Axios reported that Brown met with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in late July as part of the top Senate Democrat's efforts to lobby Brown to run again.\n9. New Hampshire\nDemocratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire announced she would not be seeking another term in 2026 either.\nDemocratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who launched his campaign in April, is widely seen as a strong contender to succeed Shaheen.\nRepublican Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator and former ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa in Trump's first term, is among a handful of candidates competing on the GOP side.\nLike Minnesota, Cook Political Report has rated New Hampshire's race leaning Democrat.\n10. Iowa\nIn Iowa, Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican, has the advantage, with Cook Political Report rating her race likely Republican.\nThree Democrats so far have launched bids in hopes of beating those odds: Nathan Sage, the former chamber of commerce director from Knoxville; state Rep. J.D. Scholten; and state Sen. Zach Wahls.\nTrump's sweeping tax, spending and policy bill, passed into law earlier this summer, is expected to be a defining issue in Iowa's race.\nErnst was one of 50 Senate Republicans who voted in favor of the legislation, which her Democratic opponents decried as a move \"to gut Medicaid for hundreds of thousands of Iowa children and families.\" Iowa's primary is set for June 2.\n11. Nebraska\nNebraska is widely seen as a Republican stronghold with incumbent GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts, though there could be a surprisingly competitive race in 2026 with Independent candidate Dan Osborn jumping back into a statewide election.\nOsborn came within 7 percentage points of beating Sen. Deb Fischer in 2024, a closer-than-expected margin in the GOP-dominated state.\nOsborn, a former labor leader, is a registered Independent but received campaign contributions from Democrats in his last campaign (money he told NBC he did not ask for). Ricketts, a former Nebraska governor and part owner with his family of the Chicago Cubs, is running for a full term after being appointed to the job in January 2023 upon the resignation of Republican Sen. Ben Sasse."

      "text": "Big Beautiful Bill 101: What you need to know about the new law\nIn the classic Schoolhouse Rock song \u201cI\u2019m Just a Bill,\u201d the bill laments the prospect of waiting with other bills, hoping to become a law. But President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d didn\u2019t have to wait\u2014it sped through Congress in recent days and landed on his desk in time for him to sign it into law by his July 4 deadline.\nAmid the whirlwind on Capitol Hill, you might have missed what\u2019s actually in this massive tax and spending law. Below we've collected some of the most impactful parts for your finances and daily life. The biggest among them:\n\u25fe Extension of the 2017 tax cuts: This is the biggest item, costing about $3.7 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation. That\u2019s money the federal government won\u2019t collect.\n\u25fe Cuts to health care and food programs: These proposed reductions would save about $1.3 trillion, based on a June 17 report from the Congressional Budget Office.\nWhat's in the 'Big Beautiful Bill'\nSkip to: OTHER TAX CUTS, BENEFITS | MORE FUNDING | LESS FUNDING\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model forecasts that the lowest-income households will be left worse off because of cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. Those Americans could lose $27,500 over a lifetime, while the highest-income households would gain more than $65,000. How people at every income level will fare:\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\nBut wait, there's more. Other tax cuts, credits and gifts\nIn addition to extending the tax cuts from the 2017 tax bill, Americans who live in high-tax states such as California, New York and New Jersey will get a bigger income tax deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. That tax break will last only through 2028.\nIn one of the most talked-about provisions and one of Trump's 2024 campaign promises, tips and overtime wages will no longer be taxed \u2212 sort of. The final version of the bill set limits on both. Some of the other tax reductions you can expect:\nWhat areas would get more money from the bill\nWhat areas would get less money from the bill\nHow big is the bill for the tax bill?\nDepending on whom you ask on Capitol Hill, the cost of the bill could be as little as $440 billion, while other, more conventional estimates put the cost at nearly 10 times higher.\nAs Senate Republicans pushed toward passage, they requested that the Joint Committee on Taxation omit the 2017 tax cuts in a new estimate. Without those portions, the bill's total cost falls to $441 billion. Senate Republicans argue that because the bill extends current tax law, those cuts shouldn't be counted. More traditional methods have pegged the cost around $2.7 trillion to $3.3 trillion.\nContributing: Reuters"

      "text": "All work and no play: House heads out while Senate eyes skipping summer break\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The House of Representatives has fled Washington for their annual August recess, but the Senate may be stuck sweltering at work.\nBoth houses of Congress typically take a month off each summer, with many returning to their districts and visiting with constituents.\nThis year, House members were sent home a day early, amid tensions over the Trump administration's refusal to release records from sex offender and former Trump friend Jeffrey Epstein's case.\nMeanwhile, senators have at least one more week before they go on break. But as legislative business hits a series of delays and major deadlines loom, President Donald Trump is pushing the upper chamber to stay in town.\nEither way, both chambers have a tall order waiting for them in September if they want to keep the government doors open.\nHouse heads home\nFollowing the Justice Department's announcement that they had found no evidence of an Epstein list of sex work clients or proof of other conspiracy theories such as the claim that the disgraced financier did not really commit suicide in 2019, Trump has been at odds with some of his high-profile supporters.\nDemocrats and some Republican lawmakers have called for the release of documents related to Epstein\u2019s case. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, is spearheading bipartisan legislation to force the Justice Department\u2019s hand on the matter.\nPressure to address the scandal prompted House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, to cut members loose a day early.\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, called it a \u201cchicken move.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so irresponsible,\u201d she told USA TODAY. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do to take care of people.\u201d\n\u201cBecause they are afraid to buck Donald Trump, they cancel half of the session week and go home for six weeks?\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t (know) what the hell they ran for Congress for, but I ran for Congress to make people\u2019s lives better.\u201d\nNow, lawmakers are heading home, where voters could press their representatives on the issue.\nJim Jordan, R-Ohio, who said he\u2019ll be spending a good portion of his recess visiting and campaigning with colleagues in other areas, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if questions on Epstein come up.\n\u201cConstituents ask all of kinds of questions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I was back home a week or so ago, and we were at the pizza place in Urbana, Ohio, people were coming up to me just excited. \u2018President Trump\u2019s doing great. Thanks for the big, beautiful bill\u2019 ... It was all positive.\u201d\nSenators could stick around\nSenators are set to wrap up their schedule in Washington on Aug. 1. But some would rather forego the break.\n\u201cI\u2019m for staying and doing what we need to do,\u201d Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, told USA TODAY. \u201cThey pay us to work. They don\u2019t pay us to go home and sit for a month.\u201d\nCongress has until Sept. 30 to pass a series of appropriations bills or a temporary funding extension in order to avoid a government shutdown.\nThat major task, along with a backlog of nominations by Trump for the Senate to confirm, has the president calling for the chamber to keep working and Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, considering it.\n\u201cWe're thinking about it,\u201d Thune told Axios on Monday.\nThe decision would be a tough sell to many senators, on both sides of the aisle, who have a fondness for their time back home.\nSen. Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, said that along with meeting voters, he will be spending the weeks away with his children in Georgia.\nAsked about the possibility of recess being canceled, Warnock said, \u201cThat\u2019s above my pay grade.\u201d\nWorking hard or hardly working\nSen. Deb Fischer, R-Nebraska, said she is doing what she usually does during recess, which is travel by car across the state, with her husband at the wheel, visiting communities and constituents.\nHouse members, who have since left the city, say they won\u2019t be slacking over August.\nMembers of Congress will return to their district offices, often holding events, meeting with constituents and discussing legislative business from afar.\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, said when asked if he had any fun recess plans, \u201cUh, no. Working.\u201d\nTennessee\u2019s Republican Rep. Tim Burchett offered a similar response.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do more work when I\u2019m home than I do up here,\u201d he said, adding jokingly, \u201cThese two-hour work weeks up here wear me out.\u201d"

      "text": "Current and former lawmakers know Congress is dysfunctional. Will the infighting stop before the election?\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Looking on from the sidelines, former Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., thinks he retired from Congress at the perfect time.\nThe former long-serving lawmaker left the House just before Republicans took control of the lower chamber last year. He wasn't in office when a handful of House Republicans joined with Democrats to oust their own leader, prompting a 3-week leadership crisis. He also didn't have to address the conservative insurgencies that embarrassed GOP officials and Congress as a whole.\n\u201cEvery day someone asks me, \u2018Aren\u2019t you glad you left when you did?\u2019\u201d Upton told USA TODAY. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d\nThe 118th Congress has been the most dysfunctional in recent memory, current and former lawmakers told USA TODAY. The silver lining is that, until November's general election, the chaos seems to be over. Congress has approved most if not all of the most controversial must-pass legislation that has sparked gridlock and infighting.\nAnd in the House, where much of the disorder originated from the deeply divided GOP majority, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., successfully beat back an ouster threat from conservative agitator Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., last week.\nWith most of the agenda wrapped up (with a few exceptions) and what looks to be one of the greatest defeats for the conservative rebels who have repeatedly thrown the House into turmoil, it appears to be smooth sailing \u2013 at least compared to the past few months \u2013 for the rest of the 118th Congress.\nMost of the bills teed up for a vote for the foreseeable future in the House are primarily aimed at shoring up vulnerable Republican incumbents while dividing the Democratic caucus and putting its most vulnerable swing-district members on the defensive. That includes a bill forcing the Biden administration to continue providing arms to Israel.\nThough House Republicans are hoping to pass a slate of government funding bills to prepare for the next spending deadline, which is at the end of September, Upton says that\u2019s wishful thinking in an election year. The former representative, who served for 36 years and entered Congress during the final years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, said lawmakers are bound to pass a short-term extension for the next Congress to deal with government funding. The 119th Congress will begin in January 2025.\n\u201cYou got bills that are just languishing with nothing done.\u201d Upton said. \u201cThey\u2019ll do a (short-term extension) in September because they won\u2019t have any appropriation bills done ... and then they\u2019ll say, \u2018We\u2019ll let the next Congress deal with it.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019s about it,\u201d that\u2019s left for this Congress, Upton said, calling it \u201cpathetic.\u201d\nCurrent lawmakers also have their doubts that Congress will get a head start on any funding debates.\nThere\u2019s \u201creally (not) anything big we\u2019ve got to do\u201d left, Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., who is in his fifth term, said, before noting that Republicans also have to start the government funding process for the next fiscal year. But \u201cconsidering the recent past,\u201d he said it\u2019s hard to imagine Congress will be able to finish that on time.\nFormer Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who also served in the House from 1981-1992, says \u201cthings have changed in a very dramatic way,\u201d since his tenure, in part chalking up the decline in productivity and the rise in dysfunction to the growing influence of the hard right. North Dakota has also notably shifted to the right, and Republicans now occupy both his old House and Senate seat.\nNevertheless, Dorgan said he couldn\u2019t entirely discredit the ultraconservative lawmakers: \u201cEven the most bizarre people serving in Congress \u2013 and they\u2019re loud and obnoxious \u2013 even those folks were elected. Somebody decided they wanted to send them here.\"\nWhen it comes to passing legislation that actually becomes law, the 118th is in a league of its own. Little more than 60 laws passed by Congress have been signed into law to date, a stark number compared to past Congresses. With less than six months before the election, the 118th won\u2019t be doing much else anymore.\nAmong some of the most embarrassing and strangest moments for the 118th Congress has been in the House, where conservatives have broken tradition by tanking procedural \u201crule\u201d votes for bills that govern debates on the House floor. In the past, the majority would always vote for rules, whether or not they oppose the underlying legislation. But conservatives have brushed aside that norm to protest leadership and freeze the House floor.\nCongress has historically never drawn favorable approval ratings from Americans looking on. But the 118th Congress has reached new depths, receiving an approval rating of 13%, the lowest since 2017 according to a Gallup survey.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about as low as it can get,\u201d Dorgan said. \u201cThe American people watch this, they see it and they\u2019re sick of it.\u201d\nPerhaps nothing underscores the dysfunction in the 118th Congress than a day in November that saw former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., allegedly elbowing Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., calling freshman Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., a \u201csmurf\u201d in the House. On the other side of the Capitol in the Senate, a GOP senator in a hearing challenged a union leader to a fight.\nAnd speaking to the disorder that has frequently roiled the lower chamber, McCarthy, who was on the dais for the 2023 State of the Union address and second in line to the presidency, resigned from Congress entirely last year after he was removed as speaker.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that we haven\u2019t seen fisticuffs on the House floor frankly,\u201d Upton remarked.\n\u201cIf all we\u2019re gonna do is come up here and pass messaging bills that we know are not going anywhere,\u201d then House leaders should shorten workweeks in Washington to allow members to spend more time in their districts, Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a freshman lawmaker, said, describing the agenda as a source of frustration. \u201cI want to get things done.\u201d"

Despite efforts to maintain a normal legislative process, the atmosphere remains combative, with significant challenges ahead, including government funding deadlines and ongoing investigations. As both chambers prepare for the upcoming midterm elections, key Senate races are emerging, particularly in states like North Carolina and Michigan, where incumbents are retiring, setting the stage for competitive contests.",
