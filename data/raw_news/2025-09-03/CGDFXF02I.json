  "title": "The Best Macbook Air Deals You Can Get in 2025",
  "description": "All MacBook Airs are discounted right now. You can get the new M4 MacBook Air starting at $876, the M2 16GB RAM for $699, and the M1 for $599.",
  "content": "Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.\n\n\"Never pay full price for a MacBook Air\" seems to be the takeaway from the latest Apple launches. Apple unveiled its updated lineup of M4-powered MacBook Air laptops in early March, and all the M4s saw their first discounts a few weeks later. The M4, M3, M2, and M1 MacBook Airs are all discounted right now, with some at their lowest prices ever, according to price-tracking tools. If you're on a budget, you can always go for the older M2 and M1 laptops, which are still great laptops in 2025.\n\nThe best deal on the M4 MacBook Air\n\nThe M4 MacBook Air has been such a good value since its release that it made the M3 MacBook Air irrelevant, hence Apple discontinued it after just a year since its release. As our Senior Tech Editor Jake Peterson will tell you, the M4 MacBook Air is the one to buy.\n\nThe starts at $876.40 right now (originally $999), but it has been as low as $799\u2014so keep an eye on it. This is arguably the best option for most people. With 16GB of RAM for even the most basic MacBook Air, you'll be able to take on intensive applications and projects now and for many years to come. The most basic M4 MacBook Air comes with a 13.6-inch \"Liquid Retina\" display, with a resolution of 2,560 by 1,664, a P3 wide color gamut, and a maximum brightness of 500 nits. You'll also get an excellent backlit keyboard with Touch ID, Wi-Fi 6E support, and great speakers and microphones. Apple also decided to bring back MagSafe charging with this laptop.\n\nAll of the M4 MacBook Airs come with a 12MP camera with Center Stage. You might've first seen this feature and , which follows your face as you move around the frame during video calls. The two USB-C ports are Thunderbolt 4, meaning you can extend to up to two 6K external monitors if you buy the equipment separately. You can read more about it in . If you're unsure whether to go for one of these or the Pro, the M4 MacBook Air offers a much better value than the Pro .\n\nThe best deal on the M3 MacBook Air\n\nAs stated above, the M3 MacBook Air has been discontinued since the release of the M4, and you can only find it from big retailers used. The prices don't make sense since the M4 just offers a much better value for the money. Go up for the M4 or down to the M2 if you can't afford the M3.\n\nThe best deal on the M2 MacBook Air\n\n2022's M2 MacBook Air laptop is also on sale; currently $699 (originally $999), the lowest price this laptop has ever been. This is the best M2 you can buy as far as value for your money, and as Lifehacker Senior Tech Editor Jake Peterson explained last year, it could be the last laptop you'll ever buy. It has the same RAM and storage as the M3, but there are some key differences between the two machines you should be aware of. If, however, you have $176 to spare, the upgrade to the M4 is a better value.\n\nThe best deal on the M1 MacBook Air\n\nThe 2020 M1 MacBook Air has also dropped in price and is perhaps the best all-around value for an entry-level laptop right now. Walmart has the for $599 (it cost $999.99 prior to the launch of the M3), which is the lowest price I've seen after checking price-comparison tools.\n\nThis M1 from 2020 has 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage with about 18 hours of battery life. If you're wondering if the M1 is relevant, Jake noted the M1 is still a computer even three years after its release . Yes, its specs pale in comparison to the new M4 chip and all of its new features, but the M1 is still enough for most people.",

There are ways to make search more useful, but they aren't always obvious.\nThat's why I'm curious about Google's latest search addition. Last week, Google announced that its feature, Preferred Sources, is rolling out to all English users in the U.S. and India. If you frequently test features with Google Labs, you might remember trying this one out: Preferred Sources, as the name implies, lets you tell Google which websites you prefer to read news from. The goal, then, is to see pages from those sites in future Google searches about news stories, assuming those sites publish content related to your search.\nHow to choose your preferred news sources in Google search\nHere's how it works: When you search for something covered in the news, Google will display a \"Top stories\" section at the top of the search results page. While you can simply browse the stories that Google curates for you, you can also now click a new button to the right of the \"Top stories\" title. From here, you can search for any website, and click a checkbox next to its name to save it to your list of preferred sources. Google doesn't put a cap on the number of sources you can add, so you can fill your list with as many sites as you want. You'll also see any sources you previously saved here (including during the Labs experiment period) and you can uncheck them as you wish.\nNow, you can refresh your search results, which, with any luck, will populate with more of the sources you added to this list. Not only will they appear more frequently in the \"Top stories\" section going forward, Google may offer you a new \"From your sources\" section as well, which should only contain the websites you've added to your list. As this feature saves your preferences, you do need to be signed into your Google Account, though it seems to work across a variety of browsers. (Safari and Firefox both worked fine for me.)\nIt's not necessarily groundbreaking, but I do see the utility here. Any chance you get to personalize your search experience is probably worth taking advantage of, and with Preferred Sources, you can (and should) improve the odds the websites you know and trust appear alongside any given news story. It's also an interesting juxtaposition alongside other changes to Google Search, such as Web Guide, an AI-powered Search experience that automatically groups links into different categories.\nIt can be difficult to find high-quality information on the web these days, but I have to say, between these two features, Google is making some decent changes here."

      "text": "The new MacBooks for 2024 are finally here, although casual users might be a little disappointed. As expected, the MacBook Pro is getting a whole suite of upgrades, both to specs and the build itself, but the MacBook Air is leaving with just one change.\nM4 comes to the MacBook Pro\nThe biggest upgrade? New chips. This year\u2019s MacBook Pros can be configured with either the base M4 chip released with the iPad Pro earlier this spring, the M4 Pro announced alongside the new Mac Mini just yesterday, or the newly revealed M4 Max. That\u2019s par for the course for Apple at this point. The company also confirmed it\u2019s done with major Mac announcements for now, so it\u2019s likely desktop power users will have to wait until next year for the M4 Ultra and an upgraded Mac Studio or Mac Pro. (Don\u2019t ask me why \u201cultra\u201d is supposed to be more powerful than \u201cmax.\u201d)\nApple gave prospective buyers a small idea of what M4 Pro performance will look like alongside its Mac Mini reveal yesterday, so let\u2019s skip straight to the M4 Max. According to Apple, MacBook Pros equipped with an M4 Max are anywhere between 4.6 to 30.8 times faster than MacBook Pros with an M1 Max in rendering, processing, and building performance, depending on the program. That\u2019s a pretty big delta, and while it isn't compared against the M3 Max, take it to mean Apple is gearing this computer towards hardcore productivity workloads. On that note, the M4 Max can be configured with up to 16 CPU cores and 40 GPU cores, as opposed to the 10/10 core limit on the base M4. More reliable numbers will have to wait until reviewers get their hands on the devices, but generally, Apple says the M4 Max is \u201c2.2 [times] faster than the CPU in M1 Max and up to 2.5 [times] faster than the latest AI PC chip.\u201d\nAlso, while the M4 Max still only supports 128GB of memory (more than most people will need), it has slightly faster memory bandwidth, at 546GB/s vs. 400GB/s on the M3 Max. There\u2019s also Thunderbolt 5 support for faster data transfer speeds on compatible accessories.\nAs for the laptop itself, like on past models, it\u2019s available in 14 inches and 16 inches. Both sizes can be decked out with any of these three M4 chips, so your choice is down to comfort: Do you prefer a bigger screen or a more portable laptop?\nRegardless of what you pick, you\u2019ll get a mini-LED liquid retina XDR display (a shame that there\u2019s no OLED option like on the M4 iPad Pro) and what Apple promises is the \u201clongest ever\u201d battery life in a Mac, with an advertised 24 hours. There\u2019s also a new 12 MP Center Stage webcam, and optionally, you can configure the screen to have an anti-glare \u201cnano-texture\u201d upgrade. MacBook Pros with either an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip will also have Thunderbolt 5 support on all three of their USB-C ports.\nMacBook Air only gets one \"upgrade\"\nAgain, this is generally in line with Apple\u2019s past MacBook Pro strategy, but what\u2019s a bit disappointing is the company\u2019s approach to the Air this time around. The MacBook Air is not getting any M4 chips as of yet, although the M2 and M3 MacBook Air are bumping their memory up to 16GB (with no change in price), to match the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini. Maybe Apple doesn\u2019t want to cut into iPad Pro sales, or maybe we\u2019ll see an M4 MacBook Air later on.\nAt any rate, that extra RAM might be there to support Apple Intelligence, which launched on Mac with macOS Sequoia 15.1 earlier this week, but it could also just be a sign of the times\u20148GB often doesn\u2019t cut it anymore, even for casual web browsing.\nThe 2024 MacBook Pro is available (in black or silver) now and will ship on Nov. 8th, while M2 and M3 Macs with 16GB of memory are already heading out to customers. M4 MacBook Pro models start at $1,599, while a model with an M4 Max will run you at least $3,199. M4 Pro options begin at $1,999. If you go all out with every upgrade available, you\u2019ll wind up paying $7,848, but hey, at least you\u2019ll get Final Cut Pro thrown in."

      "url": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/apples-new-macbook-air-could-be-the-last-laptop-youll-ever-buy",
      "text": "This week, Apple refreshed most of its Mac lineup with the M4 chip. The iMac now runs M4; the Mac mini now runs M4 or M4 Pro; and the MacBook Pro runs the M4, M4 Pro, or M4 Max. One major Mac product that surprisingly didn't get an M4 refresh this time around, however, is the MacBook Air. Apple's entry-level MacBook still comes only in either M2 or M3 options, so if you want an M4 laptop, you have to go Pro.\nThat might sound like grounds for disappointment, but it's not. In fact, the \"new\" MacBook Air Apple rolled out this week is officially my new pick for the best MacBook for most people. Pick one up, and I wager it will be the last laptop you buy for a long time.\nAt first glance, it looks like there's nothing new about the MacBook Air. And in fact, there really isn't. But what has changed is that Apple is no longer selling a model with 8GB of RAM. Now when you shop directly from Apple, the company only offers 16GB of RAM in the base model, but it has kept the old 8GB base model price of $999\u2014and Amazon and Best Buy have already matched the new price and configurations too.\nIn short, a laptop that used to cost a minimum of $1,199 is now $200 less expensive. That, my friends, is what I call a value.\nThe successor to the M1 MacBook Air\nApple launched the M1 MacBook Air back in November of 2020. An efficient, high-performing machine, the $999 price tag made it the laptop to beat. In the following years, Apple rolled out new MacBook Airs with design refreshes and faster chips, but the 2020 M1 Air kept dropping in price, and remained robust enough to satisfy the needs of average users, and then some.\nThe M1 kept the best value crown until earlier this year. As recently as April 2024, three and a half years after it originally launched, I still dubbed it the best MacBook for most people, especially considering you could find it in stores for as low as $699. The M2 MacBook Air (originally released in 2022) really only stole the crown from the M1 once its price started to drop as well. If you were looking for a MacBook Air during October Prime Day, for example, the $749 M2 Air was a great choice.\nBut now with double the RAM, the M2 Air deserves your consideration more than ever.\nWhat makes the \"new\" M2 MacBook Air so great?\nThe M1 Air, while still an excellent machine in late 2024, looks a bit outdated these days, mirroring the design of the 2018 MacBook Air. That includes the screen large bezels, which, while not a deal breaker, contribute to its dated look. The webcam is also lower quality than you might wish, and since the device only comes with two USB ports, you're down to one when you're charging it.\nThe M2 Air, on the other hand, is a \"new\" Mac. It sports Apple's current design language, which means its more squared-off than the M1's (admittedly iconic) tapered design. It also has a larger display for the form-factor: The M1 has a 13.3-inch display, while the M2 has a 13.6-inch display, extending the screen area edge-to-edge, and a more modern look, including the \"notch\" cutting into the display where the webcam is housed.\nSpeaking of the webcam, the M2's webcam is 1080p, a bump up from the M1's 720p camera. And while it also comes with two USB ports, it also supports MagSafe charging, which means you can magnetically charge the MacBook while keeping your two ports free for other devices. (It still supports USB-C charging, if that's what you prefer.)\nOf course, the M2 chip is objectively better than M1, but not by a whole bunch. Comparing base model chips, M1 has an 8-core CPU and a 7-core GPU, while M2 has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU. In benchmarking, that upgrade represents a subtle bump in performance between M1 and M2, but nothing crazy. Most tasks M2 can handle, M1 should be fine with, as well.\nOn paper, the M2 MacBook Air is an all-around better laptop than its M1 predecessor. That's nothing new: The M2 Air has been out for over two years now, so this discussion is quite old. Plus, the price difference was what kept these two machines in stiff competition. Sure, the new features of the M2 model were enticing, but you could save $300 or more by opting for the M1, and that made it easy to recommend for most people.\nFlash forward to October 2024, however, and the story has changed.\nThanks for the memory\nThe last four years have been a great time to be a Mac user. Apple silicon (its M-series chips) have been such a success, it's made many of us forget about the previous four years, during which MacBooks were plagued by serious issues, not least of which was their infamous butterfly keyboards. (I still miss the Touch Bar though.)\nHowever, as great as every Mac has been since the first M1 machine appeared in 2020, there was one fundamental bad habit the company could not shake: including only 8GB of RAM in the standard model. To provide a quick, oversimplified explanation, RAM (or memory) allows you to do more things at once on your computer. If you tend to single-task, you might not notice the limitations of 8GB of RAM. But if you're firing off emails while texting photos to friends while keeping a million browser tabs open in the background (including a YouTube playlist or a Netflix show), even your M1 Mac might struggle to keep up.\nPreviously, the base model for every M-series chip (minus the Pros and Maxes) came with 8GB of RAM. If you were worried about needing more RAM in the future, you were forced to consider upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM, which cost $200 extra. Suddenly, that $999 laptop was looking more like a $1,199 laptop, which wasn't the same value Apple advertised.\nThat's why this week's \"new\" M2 MacBook Air is such a big deal. For the first time since the M1 MacBook Air in 2020, a $999 laptop purchased direct from Apple is an amazing deal. Only 8GB of RAM in 2024 is questionable, but 16GB is a no-brainer. Most people will not need that much RAM for their day-to-day tasks, no, but it insures the machine will serve them well for years. There will come a day when 8GB of memory is simply not enough to run macOS well, or use inefficient apps like Chrome, but the users who bought a MacBook with 16GB of RAM won't suffer for it.\nThat's not just good news for MacBook Air fans: Apple changed the rules for all its Macs this week. The base M4 iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro all now come with 16GB of RAM instead of 8GB. It's just particularly exciting news for Apple's best value Mac.\nThe M2 Mac could last you a long time\nWe're four years into the Apple silicon era, which is long enough to see how well these chips hold up, but also not long enough to know how long Apple plans to support its new hardware. That being said, after nearly half a decade, the M1 is still going strong. My 2021 iMac has no trouble keeping up with my daily multitasking workflow, even if I do notice speed differences between it and my MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip. For most tasks, the M1 is just fine, and I expect that to be the case for the foreseeable future.\nThis is also true of the M2, only more so. It's one generation newer than M1, which means in all likelihood, Apple will support it at least a year longer than M1. In the far future, when Apple does eventually stop shipping new versions of macOS for M2, they will likely still issue security updates for some time after that, so users can continue using their Macs safely even without getting any new features. Even then, there will be third-party options, like OpenCore Legacy Patcher, that will offer ways to install new versions of the macOS on unsupported machines.\nAll that to say, spending $999 on an M2 MacBook Air today is likely one of, if not the best laptop buying decisions most of us can might right now. Sure, you can spend more to get the additional benefits of an M3 MacBook Air, or even an M4 MacBook Pro, those machines will last you as well. But if you have a grand to spend on a computer today, my choice is the M2 MacBook Air, all day, every day. I would be shocked if you needed a new machine before November 2034. As much as I've stressed that 8GB of RAM is a limitation, even M1 machines with that limited memory are working fine in 2024. The M-series Macs are just excellent machines, and this one is possibly the best value MacBook the company has ever produced.\nA final pro tip: If you're tempted to save $100 by buying the 8GB M2 MacBook Air from Amazon, don't. Instead, buy the M2 MacBook Air through Apple's Education Store. Apple will take that $100 off anyway. The deal is open to everyone, so you'll get that extra memory essentially free of charge."

      "text": "If you're in the market for a new MacBook Air, you might think the latest M3 lineup would be your best bet. After all, they're Apple's newest computers, adding dual-monitor support, Wi-Fi 6E compatibility, and a faster base model SSD than previous Apple silicon Airs. And chances are good you'd be well served by one of these machines, considering most of us don't need the additional power and features that come with the much more expensive MacBook Pro line.\nBut here's the thing: Most of us don't even need the additional power and features of the M3 MacBook Airs, either\u2014nor even those offered by the similar M2 lightweight Macs. Most of us will still find the most value in Apple's 2020 M1 MacBook Air\u2014especially now that it only costs $699 new.\nThe M1 MacBook Air is still a powerhouse\nWhile it's years removed from its 2020 debut, the M1 MacBook Air is still a fantastic computer. In fact, any of the M1 machines will still perform just about as well as they did when first released. (I'm typing this up on an M1 iMac, FYI.)\nMuch of that success comes from Apple's end-to-end control of the hardware and software in all of the M-series Macs. Not only is the M1 chip still a capable piece of tech in its own right (it dramatically outperforms i9 Intel Macs), Apple is able to optimize macOS to that chip specifically in a way it wasn't able to do with its Intel machines. So where an Intel Mac started struggling with newer versions of macOS, or losing out on features newer Macs were enjoying, M1 feels like a fresh experience even today.\nOn the software support side of things, the M1 doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. While Apple does have a habit of supporting its machines for a while, it's likely Apple silicon could break records here, assuming the company doesn't drop support for business reasons.\nJust take a look at the features page for macOS Sonoma: There is exactly one feature that requires M2 or newer\u2014the ability to connect hearing devices to your Mac. A MacBook Air that dropped in late 2020 can run every other new macOS Sonoma feature, so you aren't missing out on any of the newest macOS features by sticking with M1. We'll see if Apple introduces more features this year that aren't compatible with M1 (perhaps some of the generative AI options expected in the next version of macOS). For now though, the M1 still appears just about as supported as any other Mac chip.\nIt's at the point where you have to wonder if Apple has any regrets about how well-built the M1 is. The company doesn't even advertise the speed boost from M2 to M3, quietly noting that the M3 MacBook Air is only 1.6 times faster than the M1 MacBook Air. That's probably why the company discontinued the M1 MacBook Air following the M3 MacBook Air's release: It's easier to sell you on the M3 when the excellent M1 isn't from the Apple Store.\nIt's a ridiculously good value\nAll of these benefits come at an exceptional price for a Mac: For a long time, stores like Amazon regularly priced the M1 MacBook Air at $750, $350 cheaper than the base M3 MacBook Air. But today, you can pick up one of these great computers for as little as $699 from stores like Best Buy and Walmart. What I'm saying is, it's a great time to be in the market for a mid-range laptop, because this one will last you years.\nThat savings can be put to any number of uses: Maybe you want to add an iPad 9 to your setup, or a Series 9 Apple Watch. But I'd say if you're looking to burn that gap between device prices, you'd be better off choosing an M1 Air with 16GB of RAM. While you can get by with 8GB of RAM, doubling it will ensure you can keep more tasks running on your Mac without running into hiccups, while likely increasing the overall lifespan of your device.\nIt might be hard to find an M1 Air with 16GB of RAM new, but renewed and refurbished devices can offer the same benefits. For roughly the same price as a M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, you can pick up an M1 Air with double the RAM, and sometimes double, quadruple, or octuple the amount of storage, depending on the seller.\nIf you can swing it, an M1 Air with 16GB of RAM will serve you well for quite some time to come, and will likely be able to handle more tabs and tasks than an M3 Air with 8GB of RAM.\nThe M2 MacBook Airs are a great value, too\nLet's not discredit the M2 MacBook Air. After all, there are perks to buying something a bit newer. For one, the design language is more modern: The M2 MacBook Air is boxier, like the rest of the current MacBook lineup, while the M1 MacBook Air uses the tapered-off look Apple's Airs had for years. The newer Air has a cutout for the upgraded webcam, and a display that pushes close to the edge, while the M1 has a large border. It's not a bad look by any means, but it does look dated compared to newer devices.\nMagSafe could also be a dealbreaker: Why Apple abandoned the charging platform, I'll never understand, but it is back with the M2 MacBook Air. The M1 still uses USB-C only for charging, which is super convenient as most of our devices use the standard. But magnetic chargers just make sense, and it's a great perk the M2 offers over the M1.\nYou also get a chip that's one generation newer. You'll always get at least an eight-core GPU (the base model Airs came with seven), and Apple should, theoretically, support the M2 a bit longer than M1\u2014but we can't predict the future. Plus, if you want a larger laptop, you'll need to go with an M2, as Apple never made a 15-inch M1 MacBook Air. (However, Apple did discontinue the 15-inch M2.) In all, the M2s are more modern, a bit faster, and offer some more choices for certain customers.\nThe M1 is still, in my view, the better overall value when you compare dollars and cents, but now that the M3 is out, the tide is turning a bit. Apple dropped their price for the M2 by $100, so now an M2 Air with 8GB of RAM starts at the classic $999 price point. That cost will go up as you upgrade the machine: You'll spend another $200 to bump up to 16GB of RAM, and any changes to GPU or storage will only raise the price more.\nHowever, keep an eye on third-party retailers and refurbished marketplaces. As M3 takes over as Apple's newest MacBook Air standard, stores are starting to cut the price of M2 MacBook Airs, even if only intermittently. Amazon has a base model 13-inch for $879. That's a great price for the M2 and all its perks, and I imagine it would be worth $130 for some buyers to have MagSafe, a better camera, a more modern design, and a slightly newer chip over the M1 Air.\nLook, if you want the newest and best machines Apple has to offer, you can't go wrong with the M3 MacBook Airs. They're going to be great laptops, and offer the most \"Mac\" you can get at this time\u2014at least, without jumping into \"Pro\" territory. But when it comes to the best value you can get out of your purchase, that little MacBook Air from 2020 is still the gold standard. (Sorry, Apple.)"

      "text": "Apple quietly announced the new M3-powered MacBook Air this week, bringing the M3 chip to the company's most affordable and lightweight computers. But with less than a year since it release, the M2 MacBook Air is still a really solid laptop computer. Here's a rundown of the differences between these two great laptops, plus some pointers on how to choose between them.\nPerformance\nObviously, Apple has added a newer and faster performing chipset to the M3 MacBook Air. It's based on the A17 Pro Chip that's featured in the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it's built on a 3nm node, making it more efficient. It also has 25 billion transistors compared to the 20 billion transistors found in the M2 MacBook Air, and is registered at a 4.05 Ghz CPU clock speed compared to the 3.49 Ghz CPU clock speed on the M2 MacBook Air.\nThe M3 chip in the new MacBook Air also introduces a 15% faster Neural Engine, which Apple says it will be using to power more AI-related things in the future. There's also an improved and new GPU architecture, which makes the M3 chip more efficient and faster than the GPU found in the M2, and it has hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading.\nAll of that comes together to create a chipset that runs smoother and faster than the one found in the M2 MacBook Air. If you want some numbers to look at, the M3 MacBook Air scored a 3,157 in single-core tests and 12,020 in multi-core tests on GeekBench (via NotebookCheck). The M2 MacBook Air, on the other hand, scored 2,610 on single-core, with a score of 10,120 on multi-core. So, while it isn't leaps and bounds faster, there is a measurable difference.\nOf course, benchmarks are just a small factor, and a lot of the performance comes down to what you're doing with your MacBook. The new GPU architecture I mentioned before will also prove useful for some, as it further optimized the memory allocation and utilization that the MacBook air can rely on. This will be particularly helpful in graphics-heavy tasks, like 3D rendering and advanced video editing. However, users who plan to do more of that may find it more useful to upgrade to a higher-powered MacBook Pro anyway.\nThose who feel they will need the highest performing MacBook Air should absolutely go with the M3, though, as its newer chipset comes with some improved features, including the aforementioned ray-tracing.\nFeatures\nOne of the biggest new features included in the M3 MacBook Air is native support for dual monitors, which the new M3 MacBook Air will now support. The previously released M2 MacBook Air only allows for native support of up to one display, though you've been able to jump through hoops and use adapters to get by that in the past.\nThe M3 MacBook Air also comes with support for Wi-Fi 6E, making its wifi options slightly better, though not in a way that will matter for most people. The amount of ports on the M3 MacBook Air hasn't changed from the M2 model, and you'll still get access to the same MagSafe charging features, Touch ID, and built-in headphone jack. The new M3 MacBook Air will also have support for AV1 decoding, which is something that some users may find appealing.\nIn terms of aesthetics, the new M3 MacBook Air has an anodization seal to help reduce the amount of fingerprints left on the Midnight color, which was a big complaint on the M2 model. (For what it's worth, The Verge said the M3 model they tested was still pretty fingerprint-y.)\nUltimately, there aren't a lot of new features to sway you from the M2 to the M3 just yet. Once Apple starts releasing new AI features, though, the faster Neural Engine in the M3 MacBook Air may prove useful, so keep that in mind if you're interested in Apple's upcoming AI applications.\nPrice\nThe new M3 MacBook Air starts at $1,099 for the base 13-inch model. If you want the larger 15-inch model, prices start at $1,299. Keep in mind that these prices will also vary based on how much RAM and storage you choose, so going with 16GB of RAM or a larger internal storage drive will cost you more.\nThe M2 MacBook Air, on the other hand, has received a price cut, making it just $999 for the base 13-inch model. It doesn't look like Apple is selling the 15-inch MacBook Air with M2 on its website anymore, but you may still be able to get it from some third-party retailers.\nShould you upgrade?\nUltimately, the M3 MacBook Air is impressive, but if you're already running an M2 MacBook Air, there isn't much reason to upgrade. In fact, I'd argue that that the M1 MacBook Air is still a really great value, and a great option for most people out there.\nIf you haven't upgraded to a MacBook with an Apple Silicon chip yet, though, and you're still running an older Intel-based MacBook, then the new M3 MacBook Air could be a really great upgrade, especially since Apple now sells the MacBook Air in a 15-inch model."

      "text": "Earlier this week, I proclaimed the brand new M4 MacBook Air the best MacBook for most people. In short, that's because Apple packages everything that's already great about modern MacBook Airs with its latest M4 chip, all for a fantastic MSRP of $999.\nThe thing is, the M4 chip itself isn't brand new: Apple first rolled it out with the iPad Pro last May, before introducing the M4 MacBook Pro in October. Before this week, Apple had cemented the MacBook Air as the previous generation brand: If you want an entry-level Apple computer, you could buy the M2 MacBook Air for $999, or the M3 MacBook Air for a little more. If you wanted M4, well, that's \"Pro\" territory.\nM4 vs. M4\nNo longer: Whether you buy a new MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, you're getting the M4 chip. These chips are almost identical between Air and Pro, but with one caveat. The SoC (System on Chip) comes with a 10-core CPU (four performance cores and six efficiency cores) and a 16-core Neural Engine on all models, and a 10-core GPU on the Pro. You can get a 10-core GPU on the Air, but only if you pay extra. If you buy the entry-level $999 machine, you get an eight-core GPU. Those additional two GPU cores will cost you $100.\nIt's a small difference, but a difference that, on paper, suggests better performance from the M4 MacBook Pro\u2014especially for graphics-intensive tasks. If you work with animation or high-resolution video, or play AAA games, those two GPU cores on the Pro could come in handy. However, paper specs mean very little for real-world use: It's when you see how these machines actually perform when put to the test do you know how big (or small) these differences really are.\nWe'll need to wait for Apple to release the M4 MacBook Air before we see those real-world tests in action. But in the meantime, we do have some evidence that goes beyond the spec sheet. As reported by Wccftech, testers have uploaded Geekbench Metal benchmarks for the M4 MacBook Air to the internet\u2014and the results are illuminating. This test examines a chip's GPU performance via Apple's Metal API. The eight-core M4 MacBook Air scored 54,864 on the test, while the 10-core M4 MacBook Pro scored 57,788. That's a 5% gain for the MacBook Pro, which, while certainly nice to have, is not the huge jump you might expect from an additional two GPU cores\u2014especially when you consider the Pro starts at $1,599.\nAgain, benchmarks don't necessarily reflect real-world usage. Those two cores might push the Pro more than these results imply. Plus, the Pro has internal fans to keep the M4 chip cool under pressure. The Air doesn't have fans, which means it may slow down performance if things get too hot sooner than the Pro would. We'll simply need to see how these two machines stack up side-by-side when review units arrive.\nPower and price\nRegardless, the M4 MacBook Air is shaping up to be a powerhouse of a machine\u2014especially for the price. The M4 MacBook Pro, for example, costs $600 more, and while you gain additional perks like a brighter, higher-quality display, double the storage, an HDMI port, and SDXC card slot, you might find you prefer the extra $600 in your wallet. Ignoring these perks, if you're someone who is buying a Mac with power in mind, you no longer need to count out the Air. In fact, it should probably be your first choice, only ruled out if the work you do requires the extra \"oomph\" the Pro can offer.\nTo be clear, this comparison is between the M4 chip, not the M4 Pro chip. You can only get the M4 Pro in the MacBook Pro, and that model starts at $1,999. At that point, it's a very different discussion."

      "text": "Apple has discontinued the M2 and M3 MacBook Air following the introduction of the new M4 MacBook Air.\nApple previously sold the M2 MacBook Air for $999 and M3 MacBook Air for $1099. The new M4 MacBook Air includes a $100 price reduction, replacing both the M2 and M3 models with a starting price of $999 (or $899 for education customers).\nApple also reduced the price of the 15-inch MacBook Air model. The new M4 version starts at $1199 compared to $1299. Just a few years ago, the cheapest Mac laptop larger than 14-inches would run you at least $2500.\nShopping for a cheaper Mac laptop? Walmart continues to sell the M1 MacBook Air for $629 (reg. $699).\nOther retailers will likely continue to sell through M2 and M3 MacBook Air inventory. However, the lower starting price for the M4 MacBook Air means older MacBook Air models will need to be even cheaper to be a good value.\nEnhance your iPhone experience\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "When you\u2019re on video calls for hours a day, sitting squarely in front of the iPad\u2019s screen can get tiring. But if you want to move around (say, you want to show something, or if you\u2019re cooking), it\u2019s essentially impossible unless you have someone to follow you around.\nThe Center Stage feature on the iPad takes care of that. When enabled, the iPad\u2019s camera will automatically pan and zoom to follow you around.\nHow does Center Stage on iPad work?\nApple is using some clever machine-learning tricks to automatically zoom and pan the camera. The supported iPads all have a wide-angle camera lens, and by default, the iPad only shows a cropped view (the one focused on your face).\nBut as you move around, the camera view will also pan and zoom to focus on you. If someone else comes into the view, the camera will zoom out (to its actual wide-angle view) to cover more people. All of this happens automatically, so you don\u2019t need to worry about it.\nHow to enable Center Stage on iPad\nCenter Stage is built into the FaceTime app, but it also works in third-party apps that support the feature. Apps like Zoom, Google Meet, WebEx, Skype, Microsoft Teams, and Filmic Pro have Center Stage built-in.\nFaceTime actually has the Center Stage feature enabled by default, but if it\u2019s not, you can enable it from the \u201cSettings\u201d app. Go to the \u201cFaceTime\u201d section, and enable the \u201cCenter Stage\u201d feature.\nThen, when you\u2019re in a FaceTime call, bring up the options menu. From there you can enable or disable the \u201cCenter Stage\u201d feature for the call.\nIt\u2019s the same deal for third-party apps as well. Open the \u201cSettings\u201d app and find the app in question (it can be Zoom or Google Meet). Then, enable \u201cCenter Stage.\u201d You\u2019ll find a new Center Stage button in the app\u2019s video-calling interface, and from there you can enable or disable the Center Stage feature for the call.\nWhich iPads support Center Stage?\nWhile Center Stage is a software feature, it relies on newer high-quality wide-angle cameras, and those are only available on certain iPad and iPad Pro models. Here\u2019s a list of iPads that are compatible with Center Stage:\n5th Generation iPad Pro 12.9 inch (released 2021)\n3rd Generation iPad Pro 11-inch (released 2021)\n9th Generation iPad 10.2-inch (released 2021)\n6th Generation iPad mini 8.3-inch (released 2021)\nAs of 2021, four out of latest five iPads have the Center Stage feature. The only iPad that\u2019s missing from the list is the 2020 iPad Air."

      "text": "If you\u2019ve ever felt like you were duped by overpaying for something that was advertised as a \u201cgreat deal,\u201d you\u2019re in the right place. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in frenzied online shopping holidays like the upcoming Prime Day sale, with competition from Best Buy, Target, and Walmart\u2014 especially when these retailers sometimes sneak price hikes before major \u201csales\u201d or deceive shoppers with tricks to spend more than you intended to.\nFiguring out the best time to buy something requires constant watch over ever-fluctuating online prices and some knowledge of how prices have changed in the past. As a shopping and deals writer, that is what I do for a living, and I know how time-consuming it can be. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to figure it all out yourself: Here are the best websites and extensions I've been using for years to check price history and track prices so that you can be sure you\u2019re getting the best deal possible.\nThe best Amazon price tracker: Camelcamelcamel\nCamelCamelCamel is among the best ways to track prices on Amazon products. You can install the browser extension (on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Safari) to get access to the site\u2019s features without leaving Amazon, or you can just copy and paste an Amazon link or product name to the website\u2019s search bar. CamelCamelCamel shows you how the price of the item has gone up or down over time, how prices have changed through Amazon directly, and the fluctuations from third-party Amazon sellers who list new and used items.\nIf you sign up for a free account, you can set up alerts so the site can notify you by email when the price of an item drops below a certain amount, if you can get it used for a given price, or if it\u2019s at an all-time low and now is a good time to buy. You can even see previous historic highs and lows and try to map out the best time to strike.\nThe best price tracker for most online retailers and to compare prices: Honey\nYou've probably already heard of the \"Honey influencer scam\" that blew up in December of 2024. Essentially, Honey hijacked affiliate links from influencers who were sponsoring them. Also, in many instances, it deliberately chose not to give the best coupons to users who used the extension (going completely against its business model). Honey is not alone in this behavior. Many coupon aggregator companies hijack affiliate links; Honey just happens to be in the spotlight because it's the biggest one. Use your own judgment if you choose to use any of its services.\nThe bad news for those looking for a price-tracking tool that can be used for most online retailers is that Honey is the only option. The good news is that Honey's price-tracking tool can't scam you or give you subpar coupons. The Honey browser extension compares prices from a whole bunch of retailers, not just Amazon. You can create a Droplist, which notifies you if the prices drop for an item on your list if you\u2019re willing to wait for a deal. Here is what creating a Droplist can do for you:\nFirst, it\u2019ll keep the items you want to keep tabs on organized and easily accessible. Second, it\u2019ll track the prices of those products and alert you when they go on sale at any major retailer. You can see how much those prices cost leading up to the sale to see if they are, in fact, good deals or a trick from retailers to take advantage of you, and even compare them with other major retailers to see who has the best deal. You can see how to set up your droplist here.\nAs long as you don't buy the products using a Honey link, you won't be giving money to the service. You can still use their tool to your advantage without giving them any of the affiliate revenue. Until there's a better alternative, Honey is the only option that can instantly pull up price histories and track prices for multiple retailers with a browser extension (for now).\nThe best tool to compare prices: Capital One Shopping\nCapital One Shopping, previously known as Wikibuy, compares prices from other sellers when you shop on Amazon. The browser extension will notify you if a product you are looking at is cheaper somewhere else, and offers a summary of pricing history, estimated delivery time, and total price, including tax and shipping. If you can apply a coupon, it\u2019ll add that as well. When the price drops for a product you\u2019ve viewed, Capital One Shopping will notify you. When you shop, you can earn credits for your purchases at some websites, like Walmart and eBay, that Capital One Shopping has partnered with. You can trade that credit for gift cards or put it toward purchases through Capital One Shopping\u2019s site.\nThe extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and an iOS app allows you to scan barcodes and search products to do price comparisons from your phone.\nThe best price tracker tool for gamers: CheapShark\nWhile most of the others in the roundup focus on products like electronics, apparel, household goods, and appliances, CheapShark is a great option for those looking to save money on video games. CheapShark combines all of the great places to get discounts on games in one place, one easily searchable directory and database of current prices from sites including Steam, GoG, Green Man Gaming, GameStop, Amazon, and more. Of course, it\u2019s limited to video games, but you can search a game name not just to see how much it\u2019ll cost you to buy, but even if you can buy it at all\u2014and which retailer has it available. If you want, you can even filter by games currently on sale at their selected stores.\nWhen you search for a specific game, CheapShark tells you what the cheapest-ever price was, when it hit that price, and gives you the choice to either go ahead and buy it from your choice of retailer or to sign up for a price notification if it drops again.\nHonorable mentions\nKeepa: Practical price-tracking tool for Amazon and eBay\nKeepa works very similarly to Camelcamelcamel, but instead of clicking on the extension to see the price history, it'll be automatically displayed below the image of the product. This helps if clicking on the extension or installing is one click too much for you. Keepa also lets you track specific products and sends you notifications when they go below a specific price that you set. It also works on eBay. You can download the extension for Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, and Safari.\nSlickDeals: Great for finding deals and checking prices\nSlickDeals is known for bringing you up-to-the-minute discounts, coupons, and other deals from around the web, but its web-based price tracker is also great for watching prices on just about any item on Amazon and on a ton of other popular shopping sites, like Newegg, Gamestop, Chewy, Home Depot, and others.\nThe service doesn\u2019t give you a detailed price history like some of the others in the roundup\u2014it only shows a \u201cdeal history\u201d under the \u201cprice intelligence\u201d section for a few popular products. However, it will track the price of your item from when you create an alert and send you an email if the price drops below a threshold that you set. You can also return to the price tracker at any time, log in to your account, and see all of your tracked items on the same screen."

      "text": "So, you want to buy a MacBook? You have no shortage of options. If you go directly through Apple, you can pick between the Air or the Pro, in two different sizes, across a seemingly endless number of configurations. If you're shopping from a third party retailer, the issue only compounds. There are a lot of MacBooks out there.\nWhich machine you should purchase is entirely up to you and your unique needs. However, unless you have demanding or specialized work to do, there is one model that makes more sense than most. Before today, I recommended the M2 MacBook Air to most people. Its combination of price, portability, and power made it not just the best MacBook for most people, but the best laptop overall. (Sorry, PCs.) There were and are cheaper options out there, but that M2 MacBook Air was simply, in my opinion, the best overall value on the market.\nI no longer think this, because Apple just dropped a new MacBook Air, and it's my new pick for the best MacBook for most customers. Here's why.\nThe price is right\nLet's kick things off with what makes the MacBook Air great: the price. The MacBook Air has been Apple's entry-level machine for a long time, presenting a very clear trade\u2014you spend $999, you get a solid Mac. You could pay more to acquire additional features and a power boost, but you didn't have to. A cool grand was all you needed.\nApple changed that deal a bit starting with the launch of the M2 MacBook Air. Rather than offer it as the $999 entry-level model, it kept the previous generation M1 in that spot, and priced the newer model a few hundred dollars higher. Now, the \"old\" MacBook Air was your entry into the Mac line, and if you wanted the latest MacBook Air, you needed to spend more.\nLucky for consumers, the M1 MacBook Air was great. It's still pretty great, in fact. Despite Apple continuing to release new Macs with new chips, I argued the M1 MacBook Air was the best MacBook for most people up until early 2024. It was only when Apple replaced the M1 with the now \"old\" M2 MacBook Air, pricing it at $999, that I proclaimed that to be the best option.\nThe M4 MacBook Air only continues that tradition, but with a bit of a twist. The M4 is brand new, and yet it's also the entry-level machine in Apple's lineup. That $999 doesn't get you the model from last year, or the year before that: This is the freshest MacBook Air you can buy. It doesn't feel like any kind of compromise, and that makes it easy to recommend to just about anyone looking for a great MacBook for a reasonable price.\nThe M4 chip\nIf the argument was just about money, it wouldn't hold water. Now that Apple has dropped both the M2 and M3 MacBook Airs from its lineup, those machines are likely going to be on sale from other retailers. If the M2 MacBook Air was the best Mac for most people yesterday for $999, shouldn't it definitely be the best Mac for most people if they can pick it up for? That's part of my argument against buying the latest iPad Air after all\u2014it's a great tablet, but so are the older Airs that are now likely going to be less expensive than ever.\nYes, a discounted M2 MacBook Air is a fantastic value, and I wouldn't stop anyone from buying it. But I feel that $999 is an even better value for the M4 MacBook Air. For that price, you get Apple's latest chip\u2014the M4\u2014which represents the highest performing chip in Apple's laptop lineup. The M4 in the MacBook Air has 10 CPU cores, compared to eight in the M2, and its NPU (the chip responsible for running AI tasks) has a 120GB/s memory bandwidth, versus 100GB/s on the M2. The M2 is still a very capable chip, and you won't notice as big of a difference between the two as you would between the M1 and M4 (Apple says the M4 Air is up to twice as fast as an M1 Air) but there will be gains, as evidenced by independent benchmarking of other M4 chips. We won't know exactly how well the M4 Air performs until reviewers put it through its paces, but it will undoubtedly run better than a chip that came out in 2022.\nBeyond performance, Apple will almost assuredly support the M4 chip longer than the M2. I have no doubts that M2 still has many years of support ahead of it, but when the time does come for Apple to eventually stop issuing updates for these machines, the M4 will likely receive them for at least an extra year or two\u2014if not longer.\nApple is also continuing the trend of starting each MacBook off with at least 16GB of RAM. Previously, Apple's base MacBooks included 8GB of RAM, which, while enough for simple tasks, wasn't always enough for more intensive applications\u2014and didn't bode well for their longevity. You needed to spend an extra $200 to upgrade to 16GB, which completely erased the value aspect of the MacBook Air. Last year, Apple made the decision to bump all Macs up to 16GB of RAM to start, without raising the price. Maybe $999 for a laptop with 8GB of RAM is a tough pill to swallow, but for one with 16GB? It's an excellent value.\nThe perks you expect from a MacBook Air\nApple hasn't broken the mold with the M4 MacBook Air, and that's a good thing. This design is functionally identical to both the M2 and M3 MacBook Airs\u2014which is to say, it's excellent.\nThe base M4 MacBook Air still comes with a 13.6-inch \"Liquid Retina\" display, with a resolution of 2560x1664, a P3 wide color gamut, and a maximum brightness of 500 nits. It weighs the same 2.7 pounds, comes with the same great speakers and microphones, and ships with an excellent backlit keyboard with Touch ID. (The days of the butterfly keyboard are long gone.) Like the M3 MacBook Air, this M4 comes with Wi-Fi 6E support (one generation newer than the M2's Wi-Fi 6 support).\nYou also get MagSafe charging, which is among the best MacBook features. Why Apple ever rid itself of magnetic chargers, I'll never understand, but at least it has corrected itself in recent years.\nVarious smaller advantages\nWhat the company did change from previous MacBooks are minor, but notable. First up, the camera. The M4 sports a 12MP camera, which should improve the quality of video calls. However, the bigger perk with this higher megapixel count is the addition of Center Stage. This feature, introduced on iPad and found on the M4 MacBook Pro, follows your face as you move around the frame during calls. That lets you walk and talk in front of your MacBook Air, while still remaining in focus.\nThe M4 MacBook Air still comes with two USB-C ports, but they're different than the two found on previous MacBook Airs. These ports are Thunderbolt 4, not USB-4, which means there are higher minimum speed requirements here. That enables the M4 MacBook Air to extend to up to two 6K external monitors.\nThe colors have shifted a bit this go around, too. Gone is the iconic Space Gray option that many know and love, which isn't necessarily a \"small advantage.\" However, the new Sky Blue color looks great. Ever since Apple revamped the iMac line with fun new colors back in 2021, I've wanted them to adopt the same with their laptops. This is the closest we've come yet, and I hope they keep it up with future models.\nOlder MacBooks are still an excellent value (with a caveat)\nApple will let you preorder an M4 MacBook Air today, and the machine will go on sale on Wednesday, March 12. But if you have any interest in an older Mac, I'd recommend waiting to buy it if you can: Once this new MacBook is out, the discounts on older machines should follow.\nApple won't be selling new M2 and M3 MacBook Airs, but outlets like Amazon and Best Buy certainly will. If you're looking to pick up a new MacBook Air for under $999, that's the way to do it. I imagine these companies will take $100 or $200 off these models at least, if not more. If Apple is selling new M4s for $999, these stores can't justify keeping older models at the same price. Apple will likely sell used M2 and M3 models in its refurbished store, too, so keep an eye out there.\nLike I said above, the M2 and M3 chips are still excellent, and Apple will likely support them for years. No matter which of these three machines you buy, they'll feel functionality the same, since the design hasn't changed, so you'll snag a modern MacBook experience for a great price.\nCheck your RAM\nMy one caveat is to watch out for the RAM: You will likely find deals on MacBooks with 8GB of RAM, which I can't recommend in 2025. These Macs will generally work well, and may run the tasks you need to run, but you will hit limitations with that amount of memory sooner rather than later. Your Mac won't work as well as machine with 16GB of RAM, and, in all likelihood, Apple will drop support for it sooner than the models with more memory. These machines aren't worthless by any means (Apple currently fully supports all M-series Macs with 8GB of RAM) but if you're looking to buy a new MacBook this year, it's important to prioritize that 16GB of RAM."
