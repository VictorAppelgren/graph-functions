      "summary": "Taco Bell’s chief marketing officer Taylor Montgomery highlighted the importance of listening to fans, citing a recent Decades Y2K launch event that drew diehard fans to celebrate Crunchwrap’s 20th birthday. The event, held at West Hollywood’s Zouk nightclub, showcased re‑released menu items and live performances, underscoring the brand’s cult‑like popularity. Montgomery stressed that true listening goes beyond market research to include social media chatter and real‑world feedback, arguing that brands must stay authentic to avoid missteps. He noted Taco Bell’s resilient same‑store sales amid inflationary pressures, attributing success to a deep understanding of its core audience. The article contrasts Taco Bell’s fan‑centric approach with Cracker Barrel’s logo rollout backlash, emphasizing the need for brands to balance consumer input with brand identity.",
