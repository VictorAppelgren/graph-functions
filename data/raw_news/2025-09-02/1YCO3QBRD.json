  "description": "",
  "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said the U.S. is revoking its authorization to freely ship key equipment to its main Chinese chip-making site, a move that will make it harder for the company to operate in China.\n\nThe U.S. government informed TSMC of the removal of its \"validated end user\" status for its Nanjing site effective Dec. 31, the company said in a statement. The status allows TSMC to import American chip-making equipment for its existing China-based facilities without having to seek separate U.S. approval.\n\n\"While we are evaluating the situation and taking appropriate measures, including communicating with the U.S. government, we remain fully committed to ensuring the uninterrupted operation of TSMC Nanjing,\" the company said.\n\nThe Commerce Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe move to curb shipments will have limited impact on TSMC's earnings, analysts say. \"The bigger story is Washington's intent--this isn't about today's profits, it's about freezing China's chip capacity over the long term,\" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Singapore.\n\nThe Biden administration first granted the waivers to foreign chip makers operating in China, including TSMC, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, after imposing restrictions on China's semiconductor industry in 2022.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Friday that the authorization for Samsung's and SK Hynix's China plants will be revoked effective Dec. 31.\n\nFormer participants of the VEU program \"will need to obtain licenses to export their technology, putting them on par with their competitors,\" it said.\n\nThe Commerce Department added that it intends to grant export licenses to allow the companies to operate their existing facilities in China, but doesn't intend to grant licenses to expand capacity or upgrade the plants' technology.\n\nThe department estimated that the removal of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix from the VEU program will result in an additional 1,000 license applications a year.\n\nThe three companies are among the few foreign chip makers with sizable China-based production sites. The U.S. move could make it harder for them to operate effectively in China over time, analysts said.\n\nTSMC's U.S.-listed shares slipped as much as 2.3% overnight before closing 1.1% lower, while its Taiwan-listed shares fell 1.3% early Wednesday before paring losses to close flat.\n\n\"If license approvals are delayed, fabs may run into shortages that could disrupt operations within months,\" said Arthur Lai, Macquarie Capital's Asia head of technology research, in a note. Still, the group-level impact will be minimal given the low revenue contribution, Lai said.\n\nTSMC's Nanjing facility only accounts for 3% of its production capacity and the company doesn't plan to expand operations there, while the facility's revenue contribution is even lower as it makes lower-priced chips, said Morningstar senior equity analyst Phelix Lee.\n\nTSMC might redirect equipment orders originally for Japan to Nanjing instead, to stock up on spare parts ahead of the December deadline, Lee added.\n\nThe curb would further limit China's access to semiconductors made by foreign vendors, with Chinese memory makers benefiting from an upside in demand, Citi Research analyst Kevin Chen said in a recent note.\n\n\"Each new restriction forces China to double down on homegrown innovation,\" Saxo's Chanana said.\n\n\"The risk for the U.S. is that the very pressure meant to constrain Beijing may end up accelerating the race for self-sufficiency in chips,\" Chanana added.",
