  "content": "5 Of The Best Free Streaming Apps For Your Smart TV\n\nSmart TVs come with a lot of apps that you can use to stream shows and movies. Unfortunately, many services come with a subscription fee attached. There's an idea that free content is usually boring or filled with unwanted content that couldn't make it to the main studios. However, the price tag does not always signify quality or the amount of content that you get, and there is a goldmine of free programming and media that is guaranteed to keep you hooked. You might find your next favorite show is hidden in a library of free content. Keep in mind that a lot of content is exclusive to certain studios, and so some free apps will have certain shows, but others will not. Looking for alternatives is a great way to find new media that you may not have considered or known about. So this is not just a way to avoid spending more money on subscriptions, but a way to broaden your horizons while also finding some content that is familiar to you. The following list was crafted based on the extensive experience of the writer in researching, using, and reporting on streaming apps of all kinds.\n\nThe Roku Channel has been free since it started in 2017. A common myth about this channel is that it is only available on Roku devices. However, you can use the Roku app on many other devices like Samsung Smart TVs, LG Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV devices, web browsers on computers, and mobile phones. It's a lot like old school digital cable was, because it gives you a general guide and lets you surf through channels, but doesn't provide much information on those channels. However, having this free app is better than managing your subscriptions on a Roku TV. In early 2025, Roku became the second most used app on Roku in the U.S. based on user engagement. By June 2025, it made up 5.4% of all streaming TV time in the United States. This means it has the numbers to prove it's a good app to have on your smart TV. The Roku Channel has over 500 channels, which are all live and have commercials. This includes classic movies, popular TV series, live news, and kids' shows, so there is something for everyone. Second, it offers Roku Originals, which are exclusive shows and movies made by Roku. These were expanded when Roku bought the content library from Quibi. It doesn't require a subscription or even an account to start watching, though creating a free Roku account lets you pause and resume shows and save favorites.\n\nAmazon Prime Video has a lot of free content that comes with ads. Although it is mainly known for its subscription model, it has also become a major platform for free, ad-supported content, especially after merging with Amazon Freevee's library. Prime has over 200 million subscribers, but you don't need a subscription to watch the free content. While a subscription does come with perks, you only need an Amazon account to watch any of the free shows and movies on the app. One thing to keep in mind is that there are four to six minutes of ads per hour when streaming the free content on Prime Video. One of the biggest benefits of the app is that it is compatible with many smart TVs, including popular brands like Samsung, Sony, LG, Vizio, Philips, and Panasonic, and TVs with Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku. It often comes preinstalled but can be easily downloaded from the TV's app store. Many of these devices support high-quality streaming, like 4K Ultra HD and HDR, for a better viewing experience. Thanks to the merger, the free content now has original shows that were previously on Freevee, like \"Bosch: Legacy\" and \"Jury Duty,\" as well as a regularly updated collection of movies and classic TV series like \"Mad Men\" and \"Lost.\" What's cool is that Prime comes with live streams from more than 150 local PBS stations and the PBS Kids Channel without ads.\n\nI don't normally see much praise for the PBS app, despite it offering a lot of strong content. One of the best things about the PBS app is that it does not cost any money or require creating an account to start watching. PBS also normally adjusts to where you are, so if you live in Las Vegas, it will highlight documentaries and shows that are set in the city. The PBS comes with a lot of shows and movies, including popular shows like \"PBS NewsHour\" and \"Frontline\", well-known Ken Burns documentaries, and many other shows about culture, science, history, and nature. It also lets you watch live streams from more than 100 local PBS stations across the United States, so you can see local news, sports, and cultural content from your area. PBS is a great Netflix alternative if you're trying to cut services, and it works on many different smart TV platforms. The PBS app works on Samsung Smart TVs (specifically 2017 models and newer), Roku, Apple TV HD and 4K, Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick, Android TV, Google TV, Chromecast, and Vizio SmartCast TV. This means you can use the app without any trouble on most smart TVs.\n\nKanopy is one of the few free apps that does not show any ads, thanks to its partnerships. This is great for regular shows, but also for people who like educational and independent movies. Kanopy works with more than 4,000 public libraries and universities around the world, so the only prerequisite is a library card. There are some libraries that do not offer partnerships with Kanopy, but luckily, you can get a library card online for free through your state's public library system. Kanopy offers more than 30,000 movies, which include documentaries, educational movies, foreign films, and independent cinema. The main benefit is how many shows and movies it offers for kids, so anyone with a family should jump on this chance. Kanopy comes with educational and fun videos for children ages two and up, including movies, TV shows, and animated storybooks. You can also set up PIN-based controls to make sure your kids only see age-appropriate content. Kanopy works with almost all smart TVs, and is available on 2017 or newer Samsung Smart TVs, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Google TV, Chromecast, and Vizio SmartCast TV. While there is no native app for some Smart TVs, you can still stream Kanopy using Apple AirPlay on compatible Samsung TVs.\n\nYouTube isn't just a home for user-generated content and YouTube TV \u2014 it has a lot of movies and TV shows, too. While many need to be paid for, offerings in the free selection are supported by ads. The selection includes comedies, documentaries, classic films, and popular shows like \"Hell's Kitchen\" and \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" The YouTube app is also easy to fix if any problems pop up, making it a great choice for those who only want to sit down and watch. YouTube is one of the best choices on this list because it is optimized for large screens thanks to constant updates. This design, made for bigger TVs, makes content easy to see and makes navigation simpler with faster loading times. This makes using a remote control feel natural. It also supports high-quality video playback, including 4K and 8K resolution, for outstanding picture quality. YouTube is compatible with many smart TV platforms, including Android TV, Google TV, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, and Roku OS. It also works with popular streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Chromecast. The app also has voice search built in, so you can quickly find what you want by speaking into your voice-enabled remote. It relies on machine learning to suggest movies and shows based on your viewing habits, making it easier to discover new favorites.",

      "text": "How To Find & Manage Subscriptions On Your Roku Device\nAcross its line of streaming-ready devices, Roku connects users with the subscription services needed to dive into the latest TV hits and Hollywood blockbusters. Unfortunately, finding and managing individual subscriptions to the many available streaming apps can become tiresome. Do you have Hulu, or was that Netflix you subscribed to? Who even remembers anymore? Since it's rare for streaming services to be bundled together, canceling your Disney+ subscription and changing the payment method on your Discovery+ account in the same night is an obnoxious multistep process.\nThe annoyance is compounded when you consider there are more than 200 streaming services. Even if you narrow your selection down to the eight best streaming options, that's still a lot of individual accounts to manage. Thankfully, Roku has made it easier for users to not only find and access each of these services but also subscribe or unsubscribe from a specific platform. Streaming providers intentionally make it difficult to cancel a service. Some don't even let you fully manage your account on their dedicated mobile app, instead requiring you to use a web browser.\nOne of the best app management features Roku offers is a simple popup warning you that a free trial is about to end. This gives you the opportunity to cancel a subscription and avoid unwanted charges (though there are a few things to know before canceling Netflix). Beyond that, you'll need to dig a little to find and manage subscriptions. The steps that follow were performed on a Roku TV, but should be similar on other Roku devices.\nFinding active subscriptions on your Roku device\nThere are typically multiple ways you can subscribe to premium streaming services. The traditional way is to subscribe directly through the service's website, but your Roku device is also capable of managing your streaming subscriptions. To manage these accounts through Roku, you'll have to determine if you initially signed up via Roku. If a subscription wasn't started through Roku, you'll need to access the account via the service's website.\nThe quickest way to determine if a subscription is managed through Roku is by finding the app (or channel) on the home screen of your device. Using the included remote:\n- Navigate to the app icon\n- Press the Star button\n- Select \"Manage subscription\"\nIf renewal and pricing information is displayed, then your subscription is managed via Roku. If it's managed through Roku, you'll also see an option to \"Turn off auto-renew.\" Select this if you want to cancel your subscription. If you're switching to a new Roku device and can't remember if a subscription was started on your old device, you may first need to add the app to your home screen. To do this:\n- Press the Home button on your remote\n- Navigate to the sidebar menu\n- Select \"Search\"\n- Search for the app name\n- Find the appropriate app under \"Channels\"\n- Select \"Add Channel\" to add it to your device\nOnce the channel is added to your Roku device, it should remain there until you either remove it or reset your Roku TV or streaming stick.\nStarting new subscriptions on your Roku device\nJust as easily as you can cancel a subscription through your Roku device, you can also start a new one. Premium services you can subscribe to can be accessed via the pre-loaded Roku Channel on the home screen. Once you've accessed the Roku Channel:\n- Scroll to \"Browse Premium Subscriptions\"\n- Find the service you want to subscribe to\n- Press the Star button\n- Choose the subscription you want to activate\nTo subscribe to any service on your Roku device, you will need to have a payment method on file. This can be added by going to the home screen, scrolling to and selecting \"Settings,\" then selecting \"Payment Method.\" Here, you can add a new or update an old payment method.\nIt's possible that the app doesn't open a prompt after pressing the Star button; you may need to open the app directly from the home screen. Different streaming services have different menus to navigate, so starting new subscriptions can differ between services. For example, when you open the AMC+ app, it brings you to a page with subscription plans to choose from.\nOther apps with free content may display this screen only when you try to access premium shows or movies. Some may hide the new subscription prompt behind verbiage like Get Access. Regardless, so long as the subscription is started on your Roku device, you will be able to manage the account directly on the device."

      "text": "Here's Why Amazon Is Discontinuing Its FreeVee Streaming TV Service\nAmazon has several brands and services under its belt. For instance, there are platforms like Audible and Amazon Music where you can listen to books and enjoy your favorite tracks, respectively. The company also owns two streaming platforms, Prime Video and Freevee. While Prime Video is over a decade old, Freevee is comparatively new, launched only in 2019. However, Amazon has decided to shut down Freevee and focus solely on Prime Video.\nAmazon recently started showing a notice in the Freevee app informing all its users that the platform will only be accessible until August 2025. Fortunately, Amazon is not dumping the Freevee content. According to the notice, all the Freevee originals, movies, shows, and live TV content will be accessible via Prime Video for free. That means you don't need to purchase the Prime Video subscription to watch Freevee content on it. But the main question here is why Amazon is discontinuing its Freevee streaming TV service. Here's everything you need to know.\nWhy is Amazon discontinuing the Freevee streaming TV service?\nOne of the major differences between Prime Video and Freevee is that the former is a subscription-based platform, whereas the latter is completely free. You might now think that Amazon must be facing huge financial loss because of Freevee, as the platform also has a vast library of original content. But that's not true. Amazon has been able to offer Freevee for free because the platform supports ads.\nHowever, Amazon introduced ads to Prime Video as well in 2024 with the intention to generate over $7.1 billion per year by 2026. Following this decision, there was no difference left between Prime Video and Freevee other than their content. That's why, to deliver a simpler and one-stop viewing experience for users, Amazon decided to close Freevee permanently and migrate all its content to Prime Video.\nAll the Freevee content will be available under the \"Watch for Free\" section in the Prime Video app. Once Freevee viewers start using the Prime Video app, they may be tempted to watch its premium content, such as The Boys, Lord of the Rings, and more. For this, they will need to purchase the Prime Video subscription, which will eventually help Amazon generate more revenue. Overall, it's a win-win situation for Amazon, as its revenue is set to receive a boost not only through Prime Video ads but also through Freevee viewers who may consider purchasing a Prime Video subscription after viewing its premium content.\nThat said, the Freevee in-app notice doesn't mention any particular date in August after which the service will become inaccessible. Additionally, the Watch for Free section will only be visible to Prime Video users residing in the US, UK, Germany, and Austria, as Freevee is currently only available in these regions."

      "text": "What Kind Of Movies Does Kanopy Have Available & Is The Streaming Service Actually Free?\nIf you're looking for a streaming alternative that's easy on the wallet, you may be eligible for Kanopy \u2014 an app that offers plenty of movies and TV shows and won't cost you a dime. Kanopy is an on-demand streaming platform similar to Netflix, Hulu, and the like \u2014 but that's pretty much where the similarities end. The company, which was founded in 2008, is the 21st-century way to rent videos from your local library. If you're old enough, you may remember what that was like, going to the branch nearest you and checking out VHS tapes or DVDs just like you would library books before returning them a few days or weeks later. Kanopy also pairs with certain university libraries, as well.\nIn order to use Kanopy, you'll need an active library card or student ID for an eligible branch. Once you sign up with your library card, you'll have access to the app. Because Kanopy is geared toward library users, you'll find a lot of educational titles and documentaries that can be useful for research projects or personal learning. Kanopy also partners with The Great Courses, which includes college lectures and other educational materials.\nHowever, there are a bunch of movies and TV shows available that are geared more toward entertainment purposes. If you use the best major streaming services to watch Hollywood blockbusters and action movies, and haven't signed up with Kanopy because you're expecting an elitist app that only has \"Masterpiece Theater\" and Jean-Luc Godard films, then you could be missing out on some of the same fun movies you'd need to pay for on other platforms.\nKanopy offers everything from classic films to comedies\nOn Kanopy, there is no shortage of high-art content that may be hard to come by on mainstream apps. There are classic movies, Oscar-nominated and -winning films, foreign-language works, and filmed stage plays. Options include \"Parasite,\" \"Memento,\" \"Charade,\" \"The Graduate,\" and \"All About My Mother.\" Kanopy also offers titles from The Criterion Collection, known for its selection of particularly high-quality films. The Criterion Collection has its own platform, which is one of the best streaming services for movie buffs, but you need to pay for it. With Kanopy, you can watch several titles for free.\nBut, sometimes you want to turn your brain off and just watch something fun. Fortunately, Kanopy also has plenty of movies and TV shows that have nothing to do with education. Just as you could rent the latest Stallone action film from your local library back in the '90s, you can use Kanopy to watch popcorn flicks like \"Mission: Impossible,\" \"Terminator 2,\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog.\" There are horror movies like \"Longlegs\" and \"The Babadook\" and comedies like \"Anchorman,\" \"Clueless,\" \"The Naked Gun,\" and stand-up specials too. You can also find television shows, including ones from Britain and other countries.\nAdditionally, you can find a ton of child-oriented content in its Kanopy Kids section. Just as with other apps like Netflix, you can enable parental controls and let children safely use the platform to watch popular titles like \"Arthur,\" \"Blippi,\" and \"Bob the Builder.\" Of course, being a library app, you'll also get more educational content and read-along storybooks \u2014 this may be one of its most unique and best features.\nIs Kanopy actually free or is there a catch?\nIf all this appeals to you, you may be wondering if there's a catch. Most libraries are free to join, and, with a library card you can access Kanopy, which means you won't need to hand over your credit card information or sign up for a paid subscription. In that sense, Kanopy is completely free. However, the libraries and educational institutions themselves must pay to have access to Kanopy \u2014 in some cases some pretty steep fees.\nYou also don't get unlimited access to Kanopy's content as you would from Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. Kanopy uses a ticket system \u2014 and the amount of tickets you have each month will depend on your local library. Some titles may cost one ticket while others could cost three or four. Once you use your tickets, you'll need to wait until they refresh at the start of the next month. Unused tickets don't roll over either. Because you're renting films, you also get a limited time to watch a title once you spend your tickets on it \u2014 this could be something like 72 hours. Fortunately, the Kanopy Kids section doesn't use tickets and young children can watch as much as they'd like.\nOther downsides to Kanopy are that \u2014 as with other services \u2014 available titles change depending on what your library has access to. Not every library will have the same options, either \u2014 the titles mentioned above are currently available for Los Angeles Public Library users but may not be elsewhere. You also don't get all the bells and whistles from paid apps like 4K resolution. However, you'll never need to worry about streaming price hikes with Kanopy.\nHow to sign up for Kanopy to watch free streaming content\nAnother drawback to Kanopy is that your library may not pay for Kanopy, which means you won't be able to use your library card to access it. Because libraries can pay as much as $350 for streaming rights to a single title, some libraries simply don't have the budget to partner with Kanopy \u2014 especially as governments slash funding for libraries. One of the biggest public libraries in the world \u2014 the New York Public Library \u2014 had to end its partnership with Kanopy in 2019. However, other major libraries such as the Los Angeles Public Library still use Kanopy, as well as many educational institutions across the globe. Here's how you can sign up for Kanopy:\n- You can check to see if your local library or school has access to Kanopy.\n- If it's available, go to kanopy.com using a supported browser. (Kanopy is available on many \u2014 but not all \u2014 browsers, operating systems, smart TVs, and other app platforms.)\n- Select Get started.\n- Select Find your library. Share your location or manually search for your library.\n- Find your library's name from the list or map, then click Select this library.\n- Enter your library card number. You may also need to provide your library PIN or password.\n- Select Continue and create your Kanopy account. You can sign up by providing a name, email, and password or use the Sign Up with Apple or Sign Up with Google features.\nOnce you've signed up with an eligible account, you can use the app on your TV, computer, or phone just as you would like Paramount+ or Hulu. Some libraries may require you to log in through their websites, however."

      "text": "5 Possible Fixes To Try If Your YouTube App Stops Working\nYouTube was created in 2005 and quickly went from having a handful of uploaded videos to hundreds of thousands, amounting to billions of hours of content. YouTube has become the most popular video hosting platform, to the point where most people don't even have a Vimeo account. And yet, despite this success, not every change from the early days has been welcomed by users. Controversial decisions like YouTube hiding video dislike counts and locking higher-quality bitrates behind a paywall certainly didn't earn them any points. The biggest blow in recent memory, though, has been YouTube's global crackdown on ad blockers.\nIt's clear the platform is making an aggressive push for YouTube Premium, forcing users to pay or else watch an endless slog of ads. We wouldn't be surprised if Google were to close all remaining loopholes and killed third-party YouTube front-ends, like NewPipe and FreeTube. Soon, you might be stuck using the YouTube app, but what if that stops working, too? This app is far from perfect, and I've experienced some of its bugs myself. The YouTube app constantly loses track of which videos I'm watching, and tends to defaults to low resolutions even on a strong connection. It often messes up captions, adds unwanted auto-dubbing, and sometimes stops working altogether. While we don't know what broke your YouTube app, we know that there are five possible fixes you should try.\nRestart the app and reboot\nIt's tiring, and perhaps even a little patronizing, to be asked if you've tried turning something off and on again. Regardless, restarts are the first thing tech support recommends for a good reason. You should be restarting your iPhone more in addition to your tablet and computer, and you might even want to reboot your router, but we digress. To quit YouTube completely on iPhone, go to the app switcher and swipe up on the app to remove it from the carousel. On Android, open the app switcher and swipe it away to close it. YouTube also recommends restarting your device. If your device has an update pending, try that as well. If that doesn't work, try switching between your mobile data and Wi-Fi, to check if it's a connection-specific issue. Toggle Wi-Fi and data on and off individually to see if anything changes.\nAnother alternative is to enable airplane mode, wait 10 seconds, and then switch it off. If you're noticing issues for other apps as well, you might try changing your device's network settings to their default values. For iPhone, go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings. For Android, it will depend on your manufacturer, though on stock Android it's in Settings > System > Reset Options. If nothing changes, try opening the YouTube app on another device. If it's not working on your iPad, either, then it might be an issue on YouTube's end. Check downdetector.com/status/youtube/ to see if YouTube's servers are experiencing any outages in your region.\nCheck your internet\nIf it's not the app or device, it's probably just you. Connectivity issues more than likely are a result of something wrong with your internet connection. First, try moving to a different place in your house where the Wi-Fi has a stronger connection, particularly if there are several obstructions (walls, fish tanks, metal decor, and other signal-blocking items) between you and the router. Nearby electronic devices, like baby monitors and microwaves, can produce interferences. It never hurts to try another Wi-Fi network, assuming there's one available. That said, you should know that your university or workplace Wi-Fi could be blocking YouTube intentionally, along with other websites and apps.\nConsider using Wi-Fi analyzing tools to diagnose your home internet issues, especially if it's not just the YouTube app that's misbehaving. Try an internet speed test like speedtest.net, and keep in mind that you need at least 0.7 Mbps to watch a YouTube video on low-quality. Try completely restarting your router by unplugging it from the wall, waiting 30 seconds, and plugging it back in. Check to make sure Ethernet cables are properly plugged in, and that there are no kinks, frays, or other visible damage to the cables. Who knows, it might be something simple like your Wi-Fi router antenna pointed the wrong way.\nIf push comes to shove, contact your ISP and see if they can diagnose any issues from their end. Your ISP may be throttling your connection, especially as if you're using a lot of bandwidth, or you've surpassed your monthly data cap. Keep in mind that your ISP may be throttling you for other reasons, like using a VPN.\nUpdate the YouTube app\nWhile it could be you, there's always a chance that the problem is with YouTube. If it's not a server outage, then in some rare situations it may be a bug in the app. One of Google's troubleshooting recommendations is to update the app. Your phone's automatic update settings may not push updates as soon as they come out, even critical ones, so here's how to manually update YouTube to rule out bugs.\nOn iPhone, go to the App Store and tap on your account picture at the top right of the screen. Pull down until you get the refresh wheel and then scroll down to the section that says \"Upcoming Automatic Updates.\" If there's an update for YouTube, it will show up here. Tap the \"Update\" button to update the app. Note, you can also just search for YouTube on the App Store. If there's an update, the \"Open\" button will change to an \"Update\" button.\nOn Android, open the Google Play Store. Find your profile picture on the top right. Then navigate to the section called Manage Apps and Device and click on Updates available. Look for the YouTube icon and, if present, tap \"Update\". Google suggests restarting your phone after an update if that update doesn't immediately fix the problem. Alternatively, you can try clearing YouTube's app data by going to Settings > Apps > Storage and choosing \"Clear cache\" and/or \"Clear data.\" As a last-ditch effort, in the event that updating the app doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Google says that doing so might clear out any lingering issues that can't be fixed with the previous methods.\nSign out and back in again\nAnother simple troubleshooting fix might be to sign out and back in again. Google recommends this, especially if you aren't using the YouTube app with an account. According to their support page, \"some features may not work correctly if you're not signed in.\" For example, age-restricted content may not be viewable without an account that has the age set to 18 years or older.\nTo sign out on iPhone, tap on your profile picture, then Switch account > Use YouTube signed out. Or, you can remove your account entirely by going to your profile picture, then Switch account > Manage accounts on this device > Remove from this device. To sign in to the YouTube app (if you've been using it account-free) tap on the Account button, then Sign in. Any account that you've previously signed in to on this device will appear on a list.\nOn Android, the process is similar. Hit your profile picture, then your account name, then Manage Accounts. Choose the account you want to sign out of, and then hit Remove Account. Google warns that on Android, signing out of the YouTube app automatically signs you out of all your Google apps. Keep this in mind if you usually use Google prompts on Android to log into your accounts, as you may now need to rely on a fallback method of two-factor authentication. If you're just using a password, Google says your account may not be secure enough, so take this as a cue to add two-factor authentication.\nTurn off DNS and VPN ad blockers\nRecent online reports in Google's war on ad blockers may explain issues that you're having with a non-Premium YouTube account. One of YouTube's newest punitive tactics against ad block users has been to slow down their videos. Now, these reports come from desktop users who use an ad blocker in their browser, not the YouTube app. Since you can't install ad blockers in the app, it would seem YouTube doesn't need to worry about lost ad revenue on mobile. However, there are methods to block ads on smartphones \u2014 and those methods could become a target for more of Google's punitive measures.\nOne of the best Mac apps that will improve your Apple experience is AdGuard, a Safari ad blocker. Its mobile version is excellent, and uses a clever method of blocking ads: denying them at the DNS level. Basically, AdGuard runs as a VPN on your phone and filters unwanted ad domains from your mobile and Wi-Fi connection. Apps, which are otherwise free to serve you all the ads they like, are often helpless against this technique. The same effect can be achieved with the best VPN services available; NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and more have a built-in ad blocker toggle.\nSo, what do DNS and VPN ad blockers have to do with YouTube app issues? It's possible that YouTube could punish non-Premium users of the YouTube app who deploy these ad blocking services. To be clear, there is no evidence that this is happening. Given Google's track record, though, this is something to try if you experience YouTube issues that can't be explained by anything else on this list."

      "text": "The Best Free Netflix Alternatives You've Never Heard Of (mid-2017)\nSomewhere in the vast expanse between Netflix and piracy lies a slew of free, legal streaming services, some more appealing than others. These free services are supported by advertisements \u2014 there's no free lunch, after all \u2014 but they're a solid option for anyone who wants to ditch cable without racking up a similar bill. You've probably heard of the most popular ad-supported service, Crackle, but how about these options?\nTubi TV\nTubi TV launched in 2014 and is the single largest collection of free, legal, ad-supported movies and TV shows available. The service has apps for all the major platforms, including Roku, Fire TV, PS4, Xbox One/360, Samsung Smart TV, Apple TV, iTunes, and Android. Of course, it can also be watched on Chromecast via the mobile app.\nTubi TV is upfront about how it competes with the major streaming services, and it even includes a section of content called 'Not on Netflix,' a special category of videos you can't watch on Netflix. Despite being free, the platform has a modern, high-quality interface, one that queues up titles, keeps track of your viewing history, and synchronizes content between devices.\nTubi TV has more than 200 content partners and says that its video library is updated every week. These content partners include MGM, Starz, Lionsgate, Conde Nast, The Jim Henson Company, The Weinstein Company, Sky, iTV, and more. The library, meanwhile, has notable items like 'Gladiator,' 'Igor,' 'Mad Max,' 'School of Rock,' and hundreds more.\nSnagFilms\nSnagFilms is another free streaming service that is well-made and updated regularly, though it doesn't have the same quality of content as Tubi TV. This service is home to a bunch of documentaries, a bunch of classics, older award-winning movies, plus television shows including a bunch of National Geographic shows, some history content, and more.\nThis service is available on some major streaming devices and platforms, including Roku, Xbox 360, Android, iOS, and Windows.\nPopcornflix\nThe name 'popcorn' in association with free streaming services is generally synonymous with 'pirated,' but that's not the case here. Popcornflix is a free and legal service that is supported by advertisements, and it has arguably better content than SnagFilms \u2014 or, at least, more popular and recognizable content.\nMovies include things like the new 'True Grit,' 'The Honeymooners,' 'The Girl Who Kick the Hornet's Nest,' and 'Iron Man.' The serivce also boasts a bunch of TV shows, among them being a ton of cartoons like 'Inspector Gadget' and 'Sonic the Hedgehog.'\nSupported platforms include Roku, Xbox, PS4, Fire TV, Android, iOS, and even YouTube, where you can find a bunch of movies in their entirety.\nDramaFever\nIf you like Korean television and movies, DramaFever is the place to be. This service is free and offers entertainment from South Korea across every genre imaginable, including reality television, comedies, romance, thrillers, and more. Content is free and available on all the major devices and platforms, including Roku, Android, iOS, Samsung Smart TVs, PS3/PS4, Fire TV, Apple TV, and Chromecast.\nPBS Kids\nIf you have young children, PBS offers a bunch of its kids shows through its PBS Kids app and website for free. The website and apps are designed in a way that makes them kid-friendly, meaning young children can navigate them on their own without ending up somewhere they shouldn't be.\nFull-length content is available for a bunch of shows, including long-running favorite 'Arthur' and newer shows. In addition to providing free on-demand episodes, PBS Kids also has free access to its live-streaming channel content.\nThe easiest way to watch free PBS Kids content on a television is to download the iOS or Android app and then cast it to a TV using Google Chromecast.\nWrap-up\nWhile you're still going to have to pay for the newest and hottest content, there's no shortage of free movies and TV shows available, and most of it is only a couple taps or button presses away. Some things, like PBS Kids, is dedicated to a young age group, while others like Tubi TV and Popcornflix span all age groups and genres."

      "text": "Every Perk You Get With An Amazon Prime Subscription\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nAmazon Prime has been around for nearly 20 years now, offering a wide variety of benefits to shoppers all over the globe. While many buyers can get by just fine without it, over 200 million people have found themselves making use of the service in their day-to-day lives. Even if you've been subscribed for years, there are likely many perks of your Amazon Prime membership you don't know about. Not only that, a lot of the services you do use might not be living up to their full potential.\nWhile there are plenty of stores with their own Amazon Prime alternatives with free shipping and other bonus perks, few of them offer the same range of benefits that Amazon does. While not every benefit is relevant for every customer, there are some that could be very useful if you haven't looked at them before. It's not a bad idea taking a closer look at everything included with Amazon Prime, especially if some of its bonuses are worthwhile to you \u2014 or to someone you know.\nFast and free delivery\nYou're probably already familiar with how Prime offers free shipping on its orders, but this is something available to every Amazon buyer, not just those with a membership. Where Prime makes a difference is with speed, as it allows you to get items within two days, and possibly even the very same day you order. This is one of the biggest reasons why Prime is an Amazon feature that entirely changes the way you shop online, as you don't have to plan ahead to account for longer shipping times.\nOf course, though, this benefit can vary depending on multiple factors, including where you live and what specific item you've purchased. While you probably can't expect everything to show up immediately, it's not impossible to get items early without a Prime membership, and free shipping is common enough on its own if you order in bulk. In other words, one of the biggest reasons to get Prime might be entirely irrelevant if you live in a big city or close to an Amazon warehouse.\nCustomized delivery\nOne feature that's unique to Prime members is the ability to customize your deliveries. With a membership, you're able to give more instructions to the company as it delivers your package, including the opportunity to have them deliver it inside your garage. You can also pick a specific \"Amazon Day\" each week for when you want your items delivered, making sure you get everything at once. For anyone living in a dangerous area or with a busy schedule, this is probably the biggest reason for you to have a Prime membership of your own.\nEven this extra feature might be subject to outside circumstances. For example, garage delivery isn't an option if you don't have a garage, and it requires smart technology to work. Similary, Amazon Day only applies to eligible items, so if something is going to take a particularly long time to arrive no matter what, you might not get it at the same time as everything else.\nExclusive deals\nSeparate from the aforementioned Amazon Day, Prime members can also take advantage of Prime Day. There are two major shopping events \u2013 one in July (Amazon Prime Day) and the other in October (Prime Big Deal Days). In both, customers with a membership gain access to exclusive discounts on popular items, allowing buyers to save money during these days. Access to these discounts is only available to those with an active Prime membership.\nWhile not everything on the website is discounted during Prime Day, you'll probably be able to find something you could use anyway. We recently detailed the best deals on our favorite tech for October Prime Day 2024, which included extremely popular monitors and headphones. It's worth keeping an eye on if you're a long-time subscriber, especially considering how the October date didn't even exist until 2022. More changes \u2014 and possibly more Prime Days \u2014 could come around in the future, which should let you get a bit more value out of your account when they arrive.\nPrime streaming services\nAmazon Prime doesn't just provide benefits for those willing to spend more money. It also grants access to a large library of media, including videos, books, music, and games. These all come with unique benefits for members, with Prime Video showcasing Amazon-original shows, Prime Gaming offering special in-game rewards, and Amazon Music giving Prime customers a discount on its \"unlimited\" subscription. You might not be using any of these services as often as you could be, especially if you haven't kept up-to-date with their latest offerings.\nThese perks do come with some limitations. Back in 2023, Amazon Prime Video Streaming started getting ads, requiring an additional cost for an ad-free experience. A lot of titles offered by Prime Gaming are also only available for a limited time, meaning you'll lose out on anything there if you neglect to claim it. These services are mostly helpful for long-term members rather than those dipping into a Prime subscription for one month at a time.\nUnique kid-friendly content\nUnlike the aforementioned services, Amazon Kids+ is meant for the children of Amazon account holders rather than the account holders themselves. This service consists of ad-free content including educational shows and family-friendly video games. It syncs up with specially designed devices (like the Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet) so you don't have to bother learning how to kid-proof an Amazon Fire tablet yourself. It even categorizes content by age groups, making it useful until your child reaches their teenage years.\nUnfortunately, you can't get Kids+ completely free even if you have a Prime account. But with a membership, you're able to get a discount, reducing the cost by around $30 for an annual subscription. The kid-friendly content is also somewhat difficult to navigate, and it's not a major help if you already have an existing service like YouTube Kids. Still, if Amazon is pretty much your primary website, your family can get a lot of use out of this service.\nPhoto and video storage\nWhile Prime offers a lot of content from Amazon itself, it also enhances how you manage the content you already own. Amazon Photos offers Prime members the chance to store just about every photo they've ever taken, as well as an extra 5 GB of videos. This cloud-based storage allows you to access images across multiple devices and at any time, with extra storage options being available at a few extra dollars a month. Even if you don't have a Prime subscription, you'll still have a baseline of 5 GB available for both photos and videos.\nYou should keep in mind that there's a big caveat with Amazon Prime Photos' unlimited storage. If you ever leave Amazon Prime and go over your storage quota, or you let your account sit for two years, the company will start automatically deleting whatever you uploaded. This might not be relevant for those who use Amazon every single day, but it could be something you easily forget about after a long enough period. For that reason, you shouldn't use Amazon Photos as the primary storage location for anything that you can't live without.\nOn-demand health care\nEven though it isn't free to members, Amazon One Medical is a service that isn't easy to access without a Prime subscription. This service includes a wide plethora of medical benefits including on-demand health care and prescription renewal, all lasting as long as you're subscribed. Non-Prime members can at least take advantage of a pay-per-visit option or an annual subscription purchased outside of Amazon. But these are extremely expensive, with the annual subscription costing twice as much as a Prime member's.\nPrime members also get access to extra benefits like RxPass, offering all the medication you need for just $5 a month. Some might question how well Amazon can provide this sort of health care, especially considering how it discontinued Halo devices as its controversial health business struggled last year. But if you don't have easy access to any sort of medical alternative, Amazon's health care is at least a decent option with a Prime membership.\nFuel savings\nAmazon might be more useful for those who are stuck at home, but customers who constantly drive for in-person shopping can still make use of Prime benefits. With the help of select partners like bp and Amoco, you can use your subscription to save money on every gallon of gas you pump from these companies. It actually works by linking to another app, earnify, and combining its own discount, leading to a total of 10 cents saved on each gallon. This isn't a particularly massive discount, but if you own a massive gas-guzzler of a vehicle, the membership might end up paying for itself in the long run.\nAs mentioned, you get this sort of benefit at very specific gas stations, so you might not always be able to make use of it. You can only use this deal by linking to earnify, so you won't get any discount without it \u2014 even if you have a Prime membership. Luckily, the app itself doesn't cost a dime, and it also gives you some extra bonuses you can use at gas stations for further savings. It's nothing but a win-win if you don't mind having to manage multiple accounts at once.\nBenefits with other services\nThere are plenty of other services partnered with Amazon to provide savings beyond fuel. Grubhub is one such service, offering Grubhub+ for free to Prime members. This allows you to get discounts on food from select locations and avoid delivery fees entirely, with advertised average savings of around $300. If delivery benefits happen to be one of your biggest reasons for having a Prime subscription, the extra savings from Grubhub+ might be particularly appealing, too.\nQuite a few other Amazon-owned companies take advantage of a membership as well. Many Prime shipping benefits can be used on Woot!, an alternative online store focused on special discounts. Those making use of Prime Gaming can also get a free subscription to a Twitch channel, which is especially helpful if that channel utilizes Twitch subscriber-only streams. Pretty much every company owned by Amazon will give you some sort of bonus with a Prime membership, so it might be worth looking into a subscription even if you don't use Amazon itself all that often.\nShareable Prime benefits\nEven with all of these benefits, it's possible that none of them are all that appealing to you specifically. If that's the case, you still have the option of sharing these benefits with your friends or family by taking advantage of Amazon Households. These will allow two adults to link their accounts, granting both of them access to all the Prime bonuses while only one actually has to pay. Teenager accounts can also access Prime's digital content, including Prime Video and Amazon Music, further extending the value of a subscription.\nYou'll probably want to make sure these benefits are only shared with people you trust. There also isn't very much preventing you from simply sharing a single account since you can add payment methods and addresses without many restrictions, so using Households is mostly just a precaution. Still, if you want to be especially careful with your own personal account, it's a fine way to take advantage of Amazon's benefits at a reduced cost. Even if you don't need everything offered by Prime, if you have the money to spare, you can at least help out someone who can actually make use of it all."
