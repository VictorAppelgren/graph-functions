  "title": "Homan vows to continue ICE arrests after 'Alligator Alcatraz' shutdown order",
  "description": "Homan addressed the decision for the first time on Saturday, largely appearing unconcerned about it potentially hampering the administration's mass deportation plans.",
  "content": "Border czar Tom Homan said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations would continue after Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d immigration detention facility was ordered to be shut down within 60 days.\n\nThe Trump administration was handed a legal setback on Thursday after a federal judge ordered the shutdown of the large-scale detention facility, saying it violated a federal law that requires an environmental review before any major federal construction project. Florida immediately appealed the decision, which requires the removal of all migrants housed at the facility, as well as generators, fencing, and other construction materials.\n\nHoman addressed the decision for the first time on Saturday, largely appearing unconcerned about it potentially hampering the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation plans, especially as more facilities like \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d are in the works.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop us doing what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ll follow the judge\u2019s order and we\u2019ll litigate and we\u2019ll appeal it. But [the] bottom line is, we\u2019re going to continue to arrest public safety threats and national security threats every day across this country,\u201d he said in an interview with NewsNation.\n\nHoman added that migrants could simply be moved to another facility, though he did not specify where that would be.\n\n\u201cIf we have to send them to another facility. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. That\u2019s why the president has asked for 100,000 beds in the \u2018big, beautiful bill.\u2019 So, we\u2019re going to build 100,000 beds, so we\u2019re not going to have a lack of bed space,\u201d the border czar said.\n\nHe also slammed Judge Kathleen M. Williams, who issued the order, as \u201cradical,\u201d echoing other remarks from Florida officials including Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), who blasted Williams as an \u201cactivist judge that is trying to do policy from the bench.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has been optimistic that the state\u2019s appeal will succeed, however.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be deterred; we\u2019re totally in the right on this,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cThis is not going to deter us. We\u2019re going to continue working on the deportations, advancing that mission.\u201d\n\nThe case will play out in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, with a court date not yet set.",

      "text": "A federal judge late Thursday ordered Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d immigration detention facility to be shut down within 60 days.\nDetainees currently housed at the facility must be moved out within the time frame, as well as generators, fencing, and other construction materials.\nJudge Kathleen M. Williams of the Federal District Court in Miami criticized the federal and state governments for not considering the facility\u2019s environmental impacts.\nWilliams said the governments violated a federal law that requires an environmental review before any major federal construction project. She added that it damages the surrounding wetlands and communities that rely on the Everglades for their water supply.\n\u201cThe project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased mortality to endangered species in the area,\u201d she wrote.\nThe judge partly granted a preliminary injunction to environmentalists and the local Miccosukee Tribe.\nThe ruling is preliminary, and the state is expected to ask for a stay of the ruling. The Trump administration argued that the National Environmental Policy Act did not apply because the facility houses federal immigration detainees and is run by the state.\nGov. Ron DeSantis\u2018s (R-FL) administration said some of its authority to operate the center came from the federal government delegating its immigration enforcement powers to the state.\nWilliams concluded that because the center is subject to federal funding, standards, and direction, it is also subject to federal environmental laws. She wrote that the court will \u201cadhere to the time-tested adage: If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it\u2019s a duck.\u201d\nDOZENS OF DEMOCRATS DEMAND INFORMATION FROM DHS ON \u2018ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ\u2019\nDeSantis was pessimistic that Williams would rule in their favor. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\nSeveral other federal immigration camps have cropped up across the nation as the Trump administration seeks housing for its mass deportation agenda."

Border czar Tom Homan said the shutdown would not halt mass deportations and that migrants could be moved to other facilities, citing a planned 100,000-bed expansion. Governor Ron DeSantis criticized the judge as \u201cradical\u201d and said the state\u2019s appeal would succeed, while the case moves to the 11th Circuit. The judge cited damage to wetlands and endangered species, noting the center\u2019s federal funding made it subject to the National Environmental Policy Act. The decision highlights tensions between federal immigration enforcement and environmental regulations.",
