  "title": "First look at Narwal's new robot vacuum: The Freo Z10 Ultra is millennial gray and makes game-time decisions",
  "description": "There's a $400 early bird discount if you order between Sept. 12 and 28.",
  "content": "ORDER AND SAVE ON SEPT. 12: Narwal announced the Freo Z10 Ultra robot vacuum and mop combo on Sept. 4. It will be available to purchase at early bird pricing of $899 starting Sept. 12, but will eventually retail for $1,299 after Sept. 28.\n\nA gray self-emptying robot vacuum is huge news for anyone who's trying to match stainless steel appliances. But the new Narwal robot vacuum and mop combo is advertising more than living space cohesion. Officially announced on Sept. 4 (less than a month after Dreame unveiled several new robot vacuums), the Narwal Freo Z10 Ultra will be available to buy for $899 on Sept. 12. That price will bump up to its true MSRP of $1,299 after Sept. 28. My test unit arrived the night before the announcement \u2014 here are my first thoughts to spark your consideration until then.\n\nAside from one cheap Shark robot vacuum I tested last year, I rarely come across robot vacuums that aren't white or black \u2014 Narwal was smart to bet on millennial gray. The rotundness of the dock is mostly due to massive water tanks for extended self-maintenance, but that probably takes this model out of the running for the best robot vacuums for small spaces (and because it'd take herculean effort to drag up a walk-up). The touchscreen on the lid is a nice touch for those who don't want to use an app all the time.\n\nThe Z10 Ultra seems to focus heavily on adaptive cleaning, a theme I first appreciated about the last Narwal robot vacuum I tested: the CleanTok darling Freo X Ultra. One of my favorite tips to make a robot vacuum work better is to send it for two cleaning passes instead of one. This might seem obvious, but many apps require too much toggling to find that setting. However, the Narwal Freo Z10 Ultra shouldn't even require that. Its whole thing is game-time decisions, calling on dual RGB sensors and dual AI chips to read the room in real time and approach messes and obstacles accordingly. For instance, if a liquid spill is detected, the Freo Z10 Ultra will allegedly alter its mopping and water flow strategy.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by the triangular spinning mopping pads here. They extend out from under the vacuum like several other mopping robot vacuums out there, but will this wonky shape actually mop corners better than, say, the Roborock Saros 10R?\n\nThe Freo Z10 Ultra's 18,000 Pa of suction power isn't groundbreaking, but it is in line with the other best robot vacuums of the $1,000+ price range. The Roborock Saros 10 and Saros 10R that I always recommend hit 22,000 Pa and 20,000 Pa, respectively, and both retail for $300 more than the Freo Z10 Ultra. It also beats the regular Freo Z10's 15,000 Pa and destroys the Freo X Ultra's 8,200 Pa. To me, a vacuum doesn't need the absolute best stats on paper to be a worthwhile purchase. Consistent attention to detail is just as crucial to the automated experience, and the Freo Z10 Ultra could be a pretty value-packed vacuum cleaner for picky people like me.",

      "text": "I found the most impressive robot vacuum under $500. You've never heard of it.\nI originally wanted to test the 3i G10+ robot vacuum because I heard about its debris compression feature, something I had on the brain after my disappointment with the Roomba 205 DustCompactor. The G10+ also compacts dust, sparing you from dustbin emptying for a few months and freeing you from the self-empty dock. I was curious, but what I wasn't expecting was the G10+ to deliver such a high-level experience overall, especially for less than $500.\nThe first sign of the G10+'s brainpower came during its initial mapping run of my apartment. It successfully divided every single room, aside from my very open-concept kitchen and living room. The LiDAR-powered smart mapping was even perceptive enough to label certain rooms as bedrooms and bathrooms, because it recognized beds and toilets.\nThe G10+ also steered around socks and fake pet waste (clumps of brown sugar). While it did identify most phone and laptop chargers in the app, it drove over some of them anyway. But even the most advanced robot vacuums I've ever tested don't have a perfect track record with cords. The Roomba 205 DustCompactor could barely make it to the right room without getting lost or stuck on a rug corner, so.\nBut the most surprising feature that 3i tucked in here has gotta be the livestream camera. I've never seen one of these on a robot vacuum that costs less than $1,000, let alone $500. It sounds ridiculously unnecessary at first, but I know pet parents understand the appeal of being able to remotely check on their pets.\nI'm used to managing expectations hard when testing a cheap robot vacuum. But somehow, the G10+'s 18,000 Pa of suction power puts it in the highest percentile of all robot vacuums on the market right now \u2014 that's literally only 2,000 Pa less than my favorite robot vacuum of 2025 so far, the $1,599.99 Roborock Saros 10R. There are also multiple suction settings, and you can hear the motor ramp up and see the vacuum move more slowly and carefully over carpets. The G10+ also vacuumed my bath mats without upturning them at all, and that almost never happens.\nDuring zone cleanings, the G10+ automatically cleans in a grid pattern like the Shark Matrix vacuums. The only time I really saw debris left behind was when I intentionally spilled a giant pile of rice on the kitchen floor, and the G10+ cleared about 90 percent of it in two passes.\nThe G10+ also mops. IMO, the singular, flat mopping pad design doesn't scrub as well as robot mops with spinning pads, especially along edges. But the G10+ does have a small spinning edge mop that extends to get a little closer to the wall (similar to the Roborock Saros 10). It actually detailed the wall where my bathroom floor meets the shower quite well.\nThe only \"complaint\" I could scrounge up about the 3i G10+ so far is superficial. The design is reminiscent of an antique robot vacuum from the early 2000s \u2014 it's just not nearly as sleek as most robot vacuums are nowadays. But its debris compression setup renders its curb appeal irrelevant. Because the G10+ doesn't need a self-empty dock, it can be stored under furniture (I put mine under the TV stand).\nFrom reliable small obstacle avoidance technology to a livestream camera to wickedly high suction power for this price range, the 3i G10+ has more going on under the hood than any other budget robot vacuum I've tested. Simply framing it as a Roomba 205 dupe would just be disrespectful.\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "Dreame's summer vacuum launch is the biggest vacuum drop of 2025 so far\nThe biggest vacuum drop so far this year has just happened \u2014 over half a year after CES. Dreame unveiled a total of 16 new vacuums at a press event on Aug. 6, doubling iRobot's March drop of eight new Roombas.\nDreame's summer 2025 drop officially consists of the following: Seven robot vacuums (the Matrix10 Ultra, Aqua10 Roller, Aqua10 Ultra Roller, L50s Ultra, L40s Ultra, L40s Ultra AE, and L40s Ultra CE), four wet/dry vacuums (the H15 Pro CarpetFlex, H15 Pro Heat, H12 Pro FlexReach, and G10 Pro), and five stick vacuums (the R10 Pure, R20 Pure, Z30, Z30 Station, and Z30 Essential). Shipping will begin in September for some and October for others, with pricing info on the way. I'll update this guide with prices once they're announced.\nSeveral of the vacuums fall under the same \"series\" and have small differences, like docking stations. But amid all of these enigmatic names are some pretty cool features that could make several tricky aspects of floor cleaning more practical on a daily basis.\nWhile I wait to get my hands on these new vacuums for at-home testing, let\u2019s take a quick look at my four standouts from this dreamy drop:\nDreame Aqua 10 Roller and Aqua 10 Ultra Roller\nThe most unique addition to the Dreame robotic vacuum cleaner family is the Aqua10 Roller series. Here, Dreame ditched the spinning mopping pads (that just about every hybrid vacuum and their mother have nowadays) for a paint roller-esque roller mop that rinses itself as it cleans. This is meant to mitigate any possible spreading of a spill while the vacuum goes back and forth over the whole floor \u2014 exciting news for someone (me) who has watched a robot vacuum drag ranch dressing across the entire kitchen. This feels like an even more sanitary approach than the robotic mops that go back to the dock mid-cleaning session to rinse their mops, and should cut mopping time down significantly. To me, this is a much more practical fancy flex than the robotic arm on the Roborock Saros Z70.\nDreame Matrix10 Ultra\nThe Matrix10 Ultra is another new flagship in the lineup. Its claim to fame has to do with mopping pad maintenance: The Multi-Mop Switching Dock can store three sets of double spinning mopping pads of varying textures, which the robot vacuum can switch between depending on the floor it's about to clean. The two rotating mops can also be lifted and pressed down at different heights simultaneously, ensuring closer scrubbing of uneven flooring (like the thresholds in doorways where hardwood changes to tile or carpet).\nBoth of these new flagship robot vacuums clean with 30,000 Pa of suction power, beating the 20,000 and 22,000 Pa of my beloved Roborock Saros 10 and Saros 10R. And, speaking of thresholds between floor types, several of the new robot vacuums are outfitted with Dreame's ProLeap system: A set of retractable legs on either side of the vacuum that hoist it over obstacles a few inches tall (up to 3.15 inches with the Aqua10 Roller series). I first experienced ProLeap when testing the Dreame X50 Ultra that was announced at CES 2025, and to be fully transparent, the use case felt quite limited. Actual stair climbing is still out of the question, but it could be helpful if your floors have any height changes, or if you need a robot vacuum to cross sliding door tracks.\nDreame H15 Pro CarpetFlex\nIf you're strictly in the \"I'll do it myself\" camp when it comes to cleaning, the H15 Pro CarpetFlex is a... well, dream. It's Dreame's first hard floor and carpet cleaning combo vacuum, which adds heated wet roller mops to the traditional vacuum cleaning head for carpet stain liquefaction. Inside the vacuum head also lies the TangleCut system to prevent hair from wrapping around the roller. The H15 Pro CarpetFlex even washes and dries its wet cleaning system on the charging dock.\nDreame Z30\nWhile Dreame gives Roborock a run for its money in the premium robot vacuum department, it's coming for Dyson with these new cordless stick vacuums. The Dreame Z30, in particular, has strong potential to make the next cut of my best cordless vacuums list. Why? Because, on paper at least, it's more powerful than the most powerful Dyson \u2014 it shells out 310AW of suction power compared to the Dyson Gen5outsize's 250AW.\nDreame's new CelesTect Dust Reveal Technology also poses another inevitable Dyson comparison. Dreame describes the illumination on the Z30's cleaning head as LEDs on the multi-surface brush that \"effectively detect and expose tiny dust particles in hard-to-reach corners or dimly lit areas.\" I'll be pumped if another vacuum brand finally gets on the level of Dyson's green dust-highlighting laser, but the mention of LEDs is just giving lightbulbs. Time (and testing in my apartment) will tell.\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards O\ufb00er. RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nThe conversation surrounding the best robot vacuums is a multi-faceted one in which four or five brands have a word at any given moment, fluctuating very few months as someone releases yet another new model. But regardless of the stiff competition that the Roborocks and Eufys of the world continue to pose, the Shark vs. Roomba debate is forever a heated one \u2014 exemplified when even a generic search of \"robot vacuum\" on Google triggers the \"People also ask\" box to populate with \"Is Shark or iRobot better?\"\nCementing a definitive answer on the better robot vacuum brand is tricky when \"better\" is a subjective term swayed by what a shopper needs their robot vacuum to excel at. Some may consider the better robot vacuum to have more advanced navigation that leads to less babysitting, while others may classify the one that squeezes out a sufficiently thorough clean for less money as the better value.\nThe new 2025 Roombas just changed everything\nThis would have been a very different article to read had you stopped by any time before March 2025. Before then, iRobot and Shark were both kind of plateauing in terms of the variety of their respective lineups. It was like a competition to see who could be the most mid \u2014 especially compared to the robot vacuums announced at CES.\nBut the lukewarm rivalry got interesting when iRobot went rogue and overhauled the whole Roomba fleet outside of its typical schedule (the company had previously been saving its big product drops for late summer). The new batch consists of eight new Roombas falling under four different umbrellas: the Roomba 105 or 205, or Roomba Plus 405 or 505, ranging in price from $299 to $999. (This may or may not be a last ditch effort to save the company from a reportedly bleak financial situation.)\nThese Roombas are so new that I haven't gotten to test them out at home yet. But just based off of descriptions and prices, iRobot seems to have patched up several weak spots in the lineup and prioritized budget friendliness without skimping on features that consumers really care about, like smart mapping in even the cheapest models.\nAnd up until iRobot's March 2025 announcement, neither iRobot nor Shark measured suction power in Pascals (Pa) like most of their competitors do. iRobot finally made the switch, but Shark still insists on keeping an air of mystery by solely comparing suction power to other vacuums in its own family tree. (That's what iRobot was doing with its older models, too.) Shark has also been known to make claims like \"50% better suction than the best-selling iRobot. Whatever that means \u2014 the weakest Roomba is probably technically one of its best sellers.\nWhere iRobot and Shark agree: Being weird about suction power disclosure\nPinning down whether iRobot or Shark robot vacuums are stronger is always a challenge, and not just because each offers multiple different vacs with different levels of power at different prices. The two longstanding brands aren't keen on using the standard unit of Pascals (Pa) to measure suction power like the Roborock and Eufys of the world are \u2014 an effort that could only be perceived as a secret pact to make my life as a robot vacuum reviewer more difficult than it needs to be.\nInstead, both Shark and iRobot like to keep their suction power comparisons within their own families. For instance, they might say a new model offers \"x times the suction power\" that an older or more basic model of theirs does. iRobot did originally float the idea of switching over to Pa with its March 2025 releases, but actual Pa numbers are still hard to track down online.\nWhere Roomba wins: Small obstacle avoidance and more models to fit more needs\niRobot simply has more robot vacuums, and that variety alone gives it a leg up on Shark. More models to choose from means more opportunities to customize the features and budget to a shopper's main goals for automated cleaning.\nLet's say you're willing to pay a little extra for a premium robot vacuum that achieves the most hands-off experience possible. iRobot has several options with features that make a robot vacuum increasingly self-sufficient, including mopping pads that automatically lift over carpet, self-empty docks that also wash and dry the mopping pads, and small obstacle avoidance cameras.\nBut floor type is far from the most impressive thing the smarter Roombas recognize. All j series Roombas, the Roomba Combo 10 Max, and the Roomba Plus 505 Combo all have small obstacle avoidance technology, which solves the main gripe that many robot vacuum non-believers have: robot vacuums get stuck so often that they're more trouble than they're worth. These Roombas use a special camera system to help them recognize and avoid small obstacles that less-advanced robot vacuums would typically eat, like a phone charger, extension cord, rogue sock, or pet waste.\nI first experienced this sense of relief when reviewing the Roomba j7+ and Combo j7+, and it was never easy to get back into the habit of pre-tidying when trying another robot vacuum that didn't have that. I'd easily sacrifice more intense cleaning for a robot vacuum to have the brain cells to do that.\nOne of the coolest parts about the Roomba lineup is that you can mix and match several of these features to stay within a certain budget. You can skip all of the other fancy features while still bringing home small obstacle avoidance with the standalone Roomba j7 for as little as $299 on sale, or try out the space-saving DustCompactor design with or without mopping for under $500. Even the cheapest 2025 Roombas guarantee LiDAR-powered smart mapping and 70 times (read that again) the suction power of the 600 series Roombas, which were the go-to base tier Roombas two years ago.\nI'd just like to say that I basically called iRobot's most recent move in an older version of this piece from spring 2024, saying that \"iRobot would also be wise to drop a more budget-friendly option with carpet-centric suction power.\" People sticking to a certain budget shouldn't inherently have to settle for a rinky-dink cleaner, and iRobot finally realized that that's the piece that was missing in its entry-level tier.\nWhere Roomba loses: The ultra-affordable end of the spectrum\nPlummeting earnings one month, a random revamp of the entire Roomba line the next month \u2014 if we're trying to read between the lines, I'd say it became glaringly obvious that people were getting sick of Roombas costing a lot but not doing enough.\nWhile the 2025 Roomba releases do show that iRobot is pandering to the value-minded crowd harder than ever before, the cost-per-feature situation is still stiff in the $400-and-under category. Is it too overpriced, too late for iRobot?\nFor instance, I think that the perfect starter robot vacuum is one with smart mapping and self-emptying \u2014 suction can be pretty basic. In Roomba world, the cheapest option for this is the Roomba 105 + AutoEmpty Dock, going for $449.99. In Shark world, the same capabilities can be secured for $329 at full price.\nThen, iRobot's $200 to $300 assortment is almost comically Not Worth It. In April 2024, iRobot fumbled a low-hanging opportunity to right the disappointments of its budget section. Admittedly, the $249.99 Vac Essential, $274.99 mopping Roomba Combo Essential, and slightly more expensive self-emptying versions do provide a more powerful clean than the older 600 series. But the cheap Roomba's fatal flaw remains: they still don't have smart mapping, a feature I feel is ~Essential~ in any robot vacuum. A handful of Sharks at the same prices with comparable suction power do smart map.\nSure, all of these base-tier Roombas do go on sale often. You could technically score the absolute cheapest Roomba for around $130 or a mopping, self-emptying Roomba for $280. But settling for no specific room cleaning just isn't worth it, especially when a similar wad of cash could get you way further if you were buying a Shark (or a Eufy or a Dreame model).\nIn my experience, just hitting \"go\" and letting a robot vacuum clean aimlessly is a recipe for coming home to a robot vacuum lost under the bed. The zigzag pattern feels like a hit-or-miss guessing game made more annoying by getting stuck and missing spots on the floor that I'd rather just hit with my Dyson stick vacuum, anyway.\nWhere Shark wins: Spot cleaning and affordability\nShark has been much more in tune with what the average person is willing to spend on a robot vacuum. The brand consistently offers core capabilities like smart mapping and mopping at lower prices than its Roomba counterparts \u2014 a level of cost-effectiveness that should be particularly enticing to strict budget shoppers or first-time robot vacuum owners.\nShark's more approachable price points don't necessarily mean it skimps on cleaning performance, though.\nI have both my beloved cordless Dyson and, for Mashable testing purposes, at least one robot vacuum at my fingertips at all times. I get a true sense of any given robot vacuum's value when an unexpected mess within a room in my apartment needs to be taken care of right now. So my favorite thing that I've noticed about Shark robot vacuums is that they make spot cleaning easier than Roombas do. While the iRobot app insists that you create and name an official cleaning zone, even if this is a one-time thing, Shark lets you skip the labeling charade to drag and drop a square on your map in the designated spot cleaning tab. It's just one step, but there's something to be said for streamlining.\nShark also gets a bit more nitty gritty with the spot cleaning itself. This all started with its Matrix line from 2023, which introduced Matrix mode. These Sharks clean in a grid pattern, approaching the area several times from multiple angles to grab anything it may have missed in the first pass or two. iRobot and Shark can duke it out over suction power on paper all they want, but in my testing, I found the low and mid-range Shark models (like the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 and Shark Detect Pro) to be much less likely to leave a rogue crumb or pile of hair behind than the 600 series, Essential series, and lower-end j series Roombas.\nDuring regular vacuuming, Sharks in Matrix mode dish out 30 percent better carpet cleaning than the older RV Shark models. For the 2-in-1 Shark models, Matrix mode also works with mopping when the mopping pad vibrates 100 times per minute to scrub at stains that would likely not budge when wiped with a stationary cloth. Matrix mopping came in clutch for keeping up with the constant layer of shoe prints by my front door.\nShark even extends the Matrix cleaning mechanism to its cheapest robot vacuum, making it one of our favorite \u2014 if not the favorite \u2014 budget-friendly robot vacuums in 2024. The Shark RV2310 and Walmart-exclusive Shark Matrix RV2300 and RV2300S are incredibly reliable robot vacuums for the price, often on sale for $199.99 for the standalone version and $299.99 for the self-emptying version. (If this model is sold and shipped by a third party rather than Walmart when you click, we'd advise waiting until more stock from Shark itself comes in.)\nI experienced no noteworthy issues with navigational accuracy when sending the Shark RV2300 to specifically sweep my bathroom or Matrix clean the floor surrounding the kitchen counter, which is an area I dragged and dropped in the app on a case-by-case basis. Though the suction power is expectedly just OK, it was enough for surface-level daily upkeep of the big, visible debris.\nIn September 2024, Shark finally caught on to the whole \"self-sustaining mopping pads\" thing with the release of the Shark PowerDetect line. And naturally, even the most premium Sharks debuted at $1,199.99 and $999.99 \u2014 several hundred less than the Roomba with self-washing and drying mopping pads (at the time).\nThis is the first mopping Shark that knows to stop mopping on carpeted areas without you having to specifically designate so. For good measure, the PowerDetect is also equipped with large wheels that hoist the vac over carpet to keep it dry during mopping mode. Those hydraulics also helped the PowerDetect to be one of the only robot vacs I've tested to not swirl my bath rugs up every single time.\nWhere Shark loses: Small obstacle avoidance\nShark's shortcomings stem from sparseness in its family tree and a long wait period between product drops that often have it playing catch up with other brands. The existing Shark models are also a little more basic than some of the Roombas, especially mid-tier ones.\nFor instance, the one big thing Shark was missing forever was a premium hybrid robot vacuum that could wash and dry its own mopping pads. That gap was finally closed when Shark released the Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro in September 2024. But small obstacle avoidance is the other premium robot vac feature that's come to simply be expected in vacs near the $1,000 point, and Shark's NeverStuck technology still hasn't mastered it yet. A handful of Roombas, most of them reasonably priced (at least when on sale), do check the small obstacle avoidance box.\nThis means that things like cords, pet toys, laundry, and slippers aren't really on a Shark vac's radar yet. And you have to be around to clear the floor of those before sending a Shark out. Maybe you don't mind that, maybe you do \u2014 depending on how seriously you're taking the hands-off approach in your robot vacuum search.\nOne Roomba counterpart, the $649.99 (or $499 on sale) Roomba Combo j5+, also self-empties, mops, and maps, and does the last part with small obstacle avoidance built in to take on a job even if the floor is a little chaotic. Compared to the other main brands like iRobot, Roborock, Eufy, and Dreame, who all have more than one botvac with small obstacle avoidance tech, it wouldn't hurt Shark to prioritize small obstacle avoidance across multiple models in its next product drop.\nSimilarly, only one hybrid Sharks automatically stops mopping when carpet is sensed. This means vacuum and mop mode aren't possible at the same time in the other 2-in-1 Shark Matrix models, and a person needs to manually attach the water tank to switch to mopping mode. With Matrix Mopping being such a solid feature, it's a bummer that it can't be deployed more freely.\nThough I was satisfied with the floor coverage, thoroughness, and mapping accuracy when testing the $599.99 Shark Detect Pro, it seems overpriced for the negligible differences between it and a regular old self-emptying Shark. \"Detect\" sounds like it should refer to the capability to detect phone chargers or socks, but alas, it's actually talking about a feature that increases suction when an edge, corner, or extra dirty spot is detected. This is nice, but heightened corner coverage isn't major enough to justify $600, especially when there are several Roombas in this price range that also work harder on dirtier spots, as well as mop and avoid small obstacles.\nOur winner\nRoomba\nAfter years of struggling for relevancy in the booming robot vacuum market, Shark is finally a viable Roomba contender with its value-packed Matrix line. Roomba sure as hell isn't standing still either, though, and both brands are at a point where they offer several solid options that excel at at least one bullet point of the feature trifecta that makes a robot vacuum worthwhile in 2025 (past the actual cleaning performance itself): self-emptying, smart mapping, and mopping.\nThat's where their overlap ends. Both Shark and Roomba still have blind spots, just on opposing ends of the spectrum of cost and advanced (or not) features. This is where your personal cleaning needs and budget will come into play.\nShark unequivocally packs more value into the budget-friendly end of the spectrum. All of its Matrix robot vacuums have smart mapping and can enter Matrix cleaning mode, which entails vacuuming or scrubbing in a crosshatch pattern over several passes. It's a particularly reliable feature during spot cleaning, and generally offers more thoroughness than the similarly-priced i Series Roombas. Plus, you can almost always find one of the low-end Matrix models on sale for less than $200.\nThe cheap Roombas haven't aged well, and no Roomba that'll go on sale for less than $200 can map your home or clean as thoroughly as the Matrix system.\nBut iRobot does make up for that oversight with its new 105, 205, 405, and 505 series Roombas, as well as its older j series Roombas. Ranging between $299 (on sale) and $999 (on sale), all j Series Roombas can avoid small obstacles like cords and pet waste. Two of these j Series Roombas push the hands-off experience even further with a built-in mopping arm that never needs to be removed or attached. The new Roombas from 2025 cover a ton of ground in the $400 to $1,000 range, offering a much broader range for folks to customize their purchase with the robot vacuum features they care about.\nAll pros and cons considered, we're still crowning iRobot as the better robot vacuum brand for most people. There's simply a bigger variety of Roombas to choose from, which allows for customizing your robot vacuum purchase to your budget and cleaning priorities without settling.\nWhile Shark does do more under a certain price point, small obstacle avoidance \u2014 and presumably, less babysitting \u2014 will be major for the robot vacuum skeptics who need a bot that's truly autonomous for it to seem worthwhile."

      "text": "How to make your robot vacuum work better: 3 setup tips to do right now\nHorror stories from robot vacuum owners mostly stem from two fixable mishaps: They accidentally bought a dinky robot vacuum or merely haven't set their very capable robot vacuum up for success in the settings.\nFor those who resonate with the first statement \u2014 you need to upgrade from your ancient five-year-old Roomba, for example \u2014 I've vetted a handful of good robot vacuum recommendations. (I've even curated a list of cheap robot vacuums that actually work well, if you still want to pay a price similar to your current clunker.)\nBut for those who purchased a robot vacuum more recently \u2014 as in, you did your research and know your model has more potential than you're seeing \u2014 there may be some robot vacuum features that you're just not fully taking advantage of. These settings, like suction power adjustment or customizable cleaning zones, are kind of hidden in plain sight in most robot vacuum apps. We knew they were there at one point, but it's easy for our conscious mind to go full hands-off mode and expect a robotic vacuum to do everything right, right off the bat.\nThroughout my years of testing robot vacuums in my own various apartments, I've developed a pretty solid strategy for customizing robot vacuum settings to work for various home sizes, number of rooms, and floor types. These obvious robot vacuum tips are the ones many people blow off, but they make a huge difference.\nGet detailed with mapping and zone cleaning\nA big component of how proficiently a robot vacuum does its job is how intimately it knows your living space. Much of this comes from the robot vacuum's initial mapping run of your home \u2014 and while many robot vacuums actually create a fairly accurate map on the first try, it probably won't be perfect. The first step is to split or merge rooms, and even that's easy to be lazy about. There was a period of time where I'd simply use the map a robot vacuum created even if it incorrectly mushed two rooms together. Then, I realized my life didn't have to involve so much dragging and dropping. Editing and labeling all the rooms off the bat makes the chore much more streamlined in the future.\nMy personal favorite strategy is to get super extra with customizing cleaning zones within those rooms. Some apps don't offer recurring zones, so I just create a room like \"front door.\" Others do let you add permanent cleaning zones to the map, which I always use to designate the areas that get dirty faster, like the area around a litter box. These let the robot vacuum get in and out quicker on days that you're not conducting a whole-home clean.\nYes, smart mapping is valuable even in small apartments with only two or three rooms. Without it, you won't get the luxury of virtual boundaries with zone cleaning. You'll still want to be able to say \"mop in this square, but don't mop in this square,\" or draw a keep-out zone near the pile of cords by the TV stand.\nSub-tip: If you're reading this in your preliminary shopping phase, rule out robot vacuums that don't have smart mapping at all. Bumping around and hoping for the best just isn't worth it when smart mapping is a present feature in so many budget robot vacuums. Not all robot vacuum brands will phrase this in the same way, but look for key phrases like \"home mapping\" or \"clean by room.\" After all, cleaning performance can't even come into play unless the robot vacuum makes it to the right spot in the first place.\nSend it for two cleaning passes instead of one\nWatching other people watch a robot vacuum clean for the first time is always entertaining. There's almost guaranteed to be a shit talking session about the vac missing a spot. While some junky robotic vacuum cleaners are simply bad at cleaning, a lot of people don't realize the app has a built-in backup plan: Toggle two passes instead of one.\nThe first round can be a fluke sometimes, especially if the side brushes accidentally swept a crumb the wrong way. There have been countless times when I've watched a robot vacuum do a mediocre job the first time around, turn away for a second, and look back to see the same area sparkling clean after a second pass.\nAlso, remember that many robot vacuums clean the edges of the room first, and then go back to sweep in rows down the middle. Don't get frustrated right away if your robot vacuum \"misses\" something within the first few minutes of cleaning. It's very possible that that droplet or piece of debris will be grabbed in the latter half of cleaning.\nAdjust suction and water settings on a case-by-case basis\nNot all messes on the floor are created equal. Many of your robot vacuum's cleaning sessions won't be much more than a daily skim for new dust and hair that's accumulated in the past 24 hours. But other times, your robot vacuum actually will be tackling legitimate spills, or extra-furry spots on the carpet \u2014 messes that require more oomph than the default setting you use daily. Most robot vacuum apps have a settings tab where you can scale suction power up or down (and water flow, if it's a robot vacuum that mops), so you can adjust the cleaning intensity based on how soiled the floor is.\nFor instance, I make sure to use heavy water flow when a robot vacuum is mopping the gross shoe area near the front door, or if I've sent it to wipe up a liquid splatter. I settle for moderate suction power for bathroom cleanings to avoid the botvac sucking up my bath mats, but I'm sure to crank it up to the highest suction setting for rooms with rugs covered in cat hair.\nSome premium robot vacuums have the option to let AI decide the cleaning settings for the room or zone you've selected. While I do appreciate robot vacuums that automatically boost suction power whenever carpet is sensed, I still prefer to tweak the settings myself \u2014 I know my cleaning preferences better than a machine.\nManage your expectations, like actually\nWhile customizing the above settings can expand the variety (or severity) of messes a robot vacuum can tackle, they're not always all-powerful. Even the most powerful robot vacuums have limits due to the compact motor that their slim build requires. It's impractical to send it over a catastrophic mess, like a giant pile of spilled powdered sugar or a spilled full glass of juice, and expect spotless results on the first try. If you're expecting a heavy-duty clean like that, you should probably just buy a heavy-duty stick vacuum instead.\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "How to choose a robot vacuum in 2025: Don't buy one before considering these features\nTable of Contents\nMaking the call to buy a robot vacuum instead of a stick vacuum now isn't the risk that it was half a decade ago. Not when you have a grasp on the robot vacuum features to look for.\nBack then, lazy suction power and even lazier attempts to return to the dock had many robot vacuum lemons collecting dust while their embittered owners reverted to vacuuming by hand. But in 2025, the best robot vacuum brands like iRobot, Roborock, Shark, and Eufy have robust lineups of robot vacuums that actually make life easier \u2014 not harder. And as more and more robot vacuums adapt to the changing expectations from consumers, features that were once considered premium are much easier to afford nowadays.\nDespite the less intimidating cost spectrum, it's still possible to underpay or overpay for a robot vacuum. The question isn't whether or not a robot vacuum is worth it in your home at all \u2014 it's about which features are worth it in your home. So many brands offering affordable premium features can make it hard to know how to choose a robot vacuum that'll best suit you. I can yap about all of my learned tips on how to make your robot vacuum work better once you already have it. But for those still in the shopping phase, here's a straightforward buyer's guide on the most important factors to consider before buying a robot vacuum.\nDo I need a self-emptying robot vacuum?\nSelf-emptying robot vacuums are definitely worth the convenience, regardless of how big your space is. If you're already trying to absolve yourself of vacuuming responsibilities, chances are that you also won't feel like dealing with the dust bin multiple times per week.\nWhen cleaning is automated, your floors are probably going to be swept more often, anyway, filling up a robot vacuum's onboard dustbin faster. Larger homes and homes with pets will expedite dustbin fullness as well. A self-emptying robot vacuum will come in clutch here, which automatically empties its debris into the same dock it charges on. This leaves you off the hook from any dustbin maintenance for at least a month or two.\nAutomatic emptying docks do require more floor space than the toaster-sized docks of standalone models. But there are many compact self-emptying robot vacuums that would fit in a small space.\nWhat is a smart mapping robot vacuum?\nIf there's one robot feature that you don't skip, make it this. Smart mapping is a type of navigational tech that enables a robot vacuum to scope out and remember a copy of your home's floor plan. The map drawn during the vacuum's initial mapping run will pop up in the corresponding smartphone app, where you tweak it by dragging and dropping borders, merging or splitting rooms, and adding labels. Then, the robot vacuum can clean specific rooms that need attention that day, or complete a whole-home clean.\nRobot vacuums with smart mapping are usually far more agile when it comes to maneuvering around furniture. The bump-and-go approach that most early robot vacuums rely on just can't perceive a jungle of chair legs until it's too late. I'll die on the hill that smart mapping is the baseline brain power that any robot vacuum worth your money should have. If you think about it, actual cleaning skills don't even come into play if a robot vacuum can't successfully get itself to the spots that need to be cleaned.\nLuckily, smart mapping isn't an expensive ask nowadays. A budget cap of $200 is more than enough to secure room-to-room mapping from reliable brands like Shark or Roborock.\nSpot cleaning and virtual no-go zone\nMost robot vacuums that can remember the different rooms in your home can also adhere to app-drawn barriers around smaller zones within those rooms, like around a pile of Lego bricks or your pet's water bowl. This capability is crucial if you purchase a robot vacuum that does mop but doesn't recognize the difference between tile and a bath mat (more on this in the mopping section below).\nSmall obstacle avoidance\nThis navigational prowess would mean you shouldn't have to set keep-out zones in the app at all. Robot vacuums with small obstacle avoidance can detect and avoid problem-causers like cords, laundry, and even pet waste \u2014 things that are bound to show up on the floor on one day or another. The freedom that comes with skipping the pre-tidying routine is far too convenient.\nWhile the cameras used to perceive obstacles in front of them aren't exactly the kind that take pictures, some fancier robot vacuums legitimately have livestream cameras. These give you a floor-level view of whatever the vacuum sees as it's roving your home, making it a pretty comforting tool for pet parents when they're away. Some cameras are even accompanied by two-way microphones to talk to your pets or call another person who's at home.\nWhat robot vacuum works best on hardwood floors?\nRobot vacuums have a much easier time sweeping free-floating debris off hardwood or tile than carpet. However, crumbs and hair don't have anything to grab onto on hard floors like they do on carpet, so debris often gets blown into corners. If you're picky about the cleanliness of the outskirts of the room like I am, look for a robot vacuum with a dedicated extendable edge sweeping brush. These go further than the lousy side brush affixed to cheap robot vacuums \u2014 they actually reach out a few inches past the robot vacuum's circular shape to push debris out of 90-degree angles and edges, like along the kitchen counter. Roborock's FlexiArm, seen on the Saros 10 and Saros 10R vacuums, is my favorite example.\nCan robot vacuums go from hardwood to carpet?\nYes, just about any modern robot vacuum can switch between floor types without a hiccup. However, if your home has a heavy rug situation (including those pesky fluffy bath rugs), look for a robot vacuum with large wheels that can hoist it over various thresholds and carpet piles.\nIf your home has a pretty even mix of hard floors and carpet or rugs, floor type sensors will make your life easier. With these, a botvac can tell the difference between hard floors and soft ones, adjusting its suction method (and sometimes even how high it's hovering over the floor) accordingly. This looks like suction that's automatically boosted when the robot vacuum encounters carpet or, lifting mopping pads when the vac approaches a rug.\nDo I need a robot vacuum that mops?\nIt's definitely worth getting a robot vacuum and mop combo if your home has a lot of hard flooring. If you don't feel like doing your own vacuuming, you're probably even more severely depleted of the motivation to do your own mopping.\nMopping intensity varies greatly from vacuum to vacuum. While nearly any 2-in-1 model can probably reliably wipe up a fresh juice spill with its wet cloth, a mopping mechanism like sonic mopping (which vibrates) or dual pressurized mopping pads (which spin) exert the elbow grease needed to penetrate dried stains or shoe prints. Many flagship hybrid models released in 2023 or later can also mop with a cleaning solution rather than just plain water \u2014 if you're big on true barefoot-ready sanitation. You could even shop for a soap based on your floor type, like hardwood cleaning solution or pet-safe ingredients.\nSelf-cleaning mopping pads\nWhen deciding on a robot vacuums that mop, you have two options: models that can go from vacuuming to mopping by themselves, or models that need you to be home to physically make the switch to mopping mode. Cheaper 2-in-1 robot vacuums require a person to attach a water tank or mopping pad to switch to mopping mode, while more advanced models permanently have their mopping gear onboard and are ready to start mopping whenever called upon.\nThe first approach is typically more affordable, but your robot vacuum won't be able to complete a full vacuum and mop session if you're not home to ditch the water tank. These docks also tend to get smelly if not tended to regularly enough, along with mildewy mopping pads if you don't toss them in the laundry often enough. This level of manual involvement is more annoying than it's worth to some people \u2014 a lot of folks on Reddit ask for vacuum-only robot vacuum recommendations to avoid dealing with it altogether.\nYou can get out of this by opting for a robot vacuum and mop that can wash and dry its own mopping pads. Their self-empty dock also houses two water tanks \u2014 one for rinsing and refilling clean water, and one to hold the dirty water \u2014 plus fans beneath the vacuum for drying. If you're worried about bacteria or mildew, look for a self-cleaning dock that dries with hot hair.\nThe ideal robot vacuum and mop combo for pet hair will have this feature to mitigate the amount of fur that builds up on a mopping pad.\nAutomated mop washing isn't what it was during its initial breakout in 2024. Now, you have plenty of opportunities to score a self-washing and -drying hybrid model for as low as $500, especially during a sale event.\nWhat robot vacuums work well on carpet?\nVacuuming gets trickier on carpet, where debris clings to carpet like velcro after being stepped on all the time.\nI'll get into suction power in a second, but the brushroll system can make or break a robot vacuum's carpet performance just as much as the power under the hood. The best robot vacuums for carpet wield dual spinning brushrolls. On some robot vacs, these brushrolls sit parallel and spin toward each other to pinch debris and yank it from the carpet fibers. If your one non-negotiable is a robot vacuum that works on pet hair, you might consider a setup where the brushrolls are arranged beside each other \u2014 it'll kind of look like one big brushroll, but with a break in the middle. That opening shoot prevents hair wrapping by pulling hair up into the dust bin instead of pooling it at the sides of the roll.\nWhat is good suction power for a robot vacuum?\nMost robot vacuum brands measure suction power in pascals (Pa). As of August 2025, the strongest robot vacuum you can buy hits 22,000 Pa, though a new Dreame robot vacuum is set to clock 30,000 Pa when it comes out in the fall. Such intense cyclonic oomph isn't necessary in all homes, though I would generally advise against settling for anything less than 5,500 Pa.\nWhat is a good robot vacuum battery life?\nA 90- to 100-minute battery life is sufficient for a robot vacuum to cover an apartment on one charge. This is also fine if most of your cleaning will be done on a room-by-room basis. Battery life of more than 150 minutes isn't hard to find and is ideal for square footage surpassing 2,000.\nWhen battery is low, the robot vacuum will head back to its dock to juice up. Even the cheapest robot vacuums nowadays are self-charging and should automatically resume cleaning afterwards \u2014 meaning you won't have to pick them up and escort them back to the base.\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nFrequently Asked Questions\nLiDAR is a laser-based detection system that scans different points in your home to determine where walls are. LiDAR is quick and accurate, and has solidified its spot as the most prominent form of detection tech in the robot vacuum realm.\nOther robot vacuums map with VSLAM technology, which uses cameras rather than lasers to perceive your home's floor plan. The downside of most VSLAM systems is that they need light to operate, meaning less-advanced robot vacs using VSLAM may struggle to get around in the dark. iRobot, however, has figured out an advanced camera system that incorporates an LED to light the way, not only accurately picking up on walls, but super small obstacles, even in low lighting.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks. Her ever-evolving experience in these categories comes in clutch when making recommendations on how to spend your money during shopping holidays like Black Friday, which Leah has been covering for Mashable since 2017."

      "text": "Table of Contents\nOne Roborock Saros robot vacuum, the Saros Z70 that has a mechanical arm, has gone slightly viral on the internet. But it's not even the Saros model that most people should be considering.\nThe real Roborock showdown of 2025 is actually between the Roborock Saros 10 and Saros 10R \u2014 the two more practical CES 2025 releases that have robot vacuum threads on Reddit in a chokehold.\nAfter testing both of them in my apartment for three months, I'll say this: Roborock made two of the best robot vacuums of the year here, but absolutely fumbled naming them. The addition of a single letter to an otherwise identical title almost insinuates that one is the diet version of the other, and that's far from the case. If you're confused about the difference between them, that's valid. They have the exact same $1,599.99 price, after all.\nAfter testing both in my apartment on a near-daily basis for three months, here are my thoughts on the Roborock Saros 10 vs. Saros 10R debate.\nSaros 10 vs. 10R: Design\nRoborock was impressively able to squeeze a whole lot of brains into these super-slim robot vacuums. Both the Saros 10 and Saros 10R are barely more than three inches tall, and can fit under low-hanging appliances like the refrigerator and more low-clearance furniture than thicker robot vacuums I've tested.\nUnderneath, though, the Saros 10 and 10R have one huge difference: the mopping pad situation. And this ended up being my deciding factor between the two.\nWinner: Saros 10R\nSaros 10 vs. 10R: Vacuuming skills\nThe Roborock Saros 10 and 10R are two of the most powerful robot vacuums in 2025. The Saros 10R hits 20,000 Pa, while the Saros 10 cranks it up to 22,000 Pa. To be real, both of those figures are wicked \u2014 only a few other robot vacuums on the market match 20,000 Pa. So you're getting a pretty top-notch clean with either model.\nI personally don't think the Saros 10's extra 2,000 Pa of suction power makes that much of a difference. It did offer slightly better pet hair pick-up on a few rugs, as proven by a self-emptying Shark stick vacuum that starts every cleaning session with an empty dust bin. Once a robot vacuum has finished cleaning a rug, I run the super-strong Shark over it to see how much cat hair the vacuum missed. The Saros 10 fared slightly better in this test than the Saros 10R did.\nOther debris on rugs, like crumbs in the living room or spilled rice on the kitchen runner, was rarely left behind by either vacuum.\nThe Saros 10 and 10R share the same divided brush roll system, and it's an absolutely stellar design for preventing tangling. Instead of one long brush roll across the bottom of the vacuum, an opening in the middle of two smaller brush rolls gives pet hair and long human hairs somewhere to go before they can get tangled around the brush. I haven't ever had to take scissors to a nest of hair built up under either vacuum.\nOn hard floors, both the Saros 10 and 10R pick up between 90 and 95 percent of the debris, including the mess in front of two litter boxes, loose kibble by the food bowls, crumbs from different snacks, dirt, and dust bunnies. Roborock's FlexiArm is also present on both Saros models, which extends out from under each vacuum to push hidden edge debris into the cleaning path more intentionally than a traditional stationary side brush.\nBut the Saros 10R's edge precision consistently boosts its overall debris pickup rate on hard floors. In an unfair way, the Saros 10R's mopping pad design makes it a better vacuumer. Its hinged spinning side mop slides out to lap up dust and fine debris (like salt pushed off the counter) that the Saros 10's pure force alone can't suck up, especially against a wall.\nOn several occasions, I sent the Saros 10R into a room that the Saros 10 had just been in \u2014 the Saros 10R reliably scooped up almost all of the rogue crumbs or pieces of kitty litter that the Saros 10 left in the edges of the room. If you have fully carpeted rooms, this will obviously not be as helpful.\nWinner: On paper? The Saros 10. In my experience? Saros 10 on pet hair, Saros 10R on dry debris\nSaros 10 vs. 10 R: Mopping skills\nThe Saros 10R is inarguably better at mopping than the Saros 10.\nThe Saros 10's one large, pressurized mopping pad just doesn't provide the same intensity of physical agitation as the Saros 10R's dual spinning mopping pads. In my testing, the rotating design was less likely to leave streaks of spills like wine or ranch dressing behind \u2014 it kind of mimics the movement of a hand scrubbing with a sponge rather than the singular wipe that only magically works in paper towel commercials.\nThough the Saros 10's vibrating pad isn't exactly stationary, the scrubbing diameter is still limited to the circumference of the robot vacuum. That makes the Saros 10 (frustratingly) miss a lot of dust and droplets close to wall edges or in corners. The tiny circular pad that Roborock added as a supplement to the large pad is comically small \u2014 like the size of a quarter \u2014 and borderline worthless.\nMeanwhile, the Saros 10R has completely mastered corner mopping and edge mopping. When a corner or hard edge is sensed, one of those spinning mopping pads flexes out on a hinge to scrub past where the round edge of the vacuum can reach. I'm talking nearly two inches of extra coverage compared to the quarter-sized spinning pad on the Saros 10.\nWinner: Saros 10R\nSaros 10 vs. 10R: Smart mapping and navigation\nThe type of small obstacle avoidance technology is another main difference between the Roborock Saros 10 and 10R. The Saros 10 uses Roborock's established Reactive AI technology, which recognizes and steers clear of objects in real time. The Saros 10R gets a little fancier using StarSight 2.0, which uses technology that collects more data points from around the room and allows for more predictive obstacle avoidance.\nThe level of detail the Saros 10 and 10R achieved in the map of my home is wild. They know that a shoe is a shoe and a cord is a cord \u2014 they could even differentiate between a litter box, a cat tree, and other assorted pieces of furniture, and automatically label everything as such in the app.\nI don't think the Saros 10R's system is any better at avoiding obstacles than the Saros 10's. Socks and hand towels were safe 100 percent of the time around these two vacuums, with pet toys like stuffed mice and crinkle balls coming in around 85 percent. Thin white cords, like iPhone or laptop chargers, were eaten more often than not, unfortunately.\nBut both are light years ahead of any robot vacuums that get stuck in table legs or under a bed. The Saros 10 and 10R are super nimble around furniture and simply know where they're going, making the chances of coming home to a lost or stuck botvac slim to none.\nMy bigger gripe navigationally stems from the room limit that the Saros 10R randomly imposes on the home map. Contrary to everything Mean Girls taught me, the limit does exist, and it's annoying.\nSure, this would be a non-issue in small spaces with just a handful of rooms. But in larger one-story homes or multi-bedroom and bathroom apartments like mine, it's so clutch to be able to split up and label rooms according to your preferred cleaning schedule \u2014 it's kind of the whole point of smart mapping and specific room cleaning.\nAt any rate, the Saros and the Saros 10R both have an impeccable sense of direction. Neither got lost at all during my testing and always made it to the room or zone I selected in the app.\nThe Saros 10 and 10R both have a camera that can livestream everything the robot vacuum sees in the Roborock app \u2014 a feature that sounds comically extra until you're away from home and wondering what your pets are doing. (No, literally, the Saros robot vacuums have a \"Search for the pet\" feature.) You can also \"call\" someone at home from the Roborock app.\nWinner: Saros 10 (narrowly)\nSaros 10 vs. 10R: Dock\nThe Saros 10 and 10R charging docks are, functionally, nearly identical. Both auto-empty the dust bins, wash and dry the mops, and automatically dispense detergent. Both have a clean water tank for refilling the onboard tank, and a dirty water tank to hold the gross water rinsed out of the dirty mopping pad. Compared to some other eardrum bursters I've tested, the auto-emptying noise of both Saros models is pretty tolerable.\nBut aesthetically, I'd rather have the Saros 10 out in the open in my home. I appreciate that its water tanks are covered by a lid \u2014 this makes the Saros 10 dock flat on top in case you want to decorate it a bit. I don't even care that you have to move that vase or stack of books for a second when the tanks need to be filled or refilled.\nOn the other hand, the exposed water tanks of the Saros 10R are just rounded enough for decor to potentially slide off. Though the mirrored exterior of the Saros 10R has a ton of curb appeal, the visible tank situation just loses chic points.\nRoborock also made an odd decision with color variety here. The Saros 10 is available in black and white, but the Saros 10R is only available in black. That ultimately didn't sway my decision, but I can't say that the lack of a white Saros 10R option doesn't sour my pick a bit. When you rent an apartment that fully plays into the whole \"minimalist all white everything\" design, a robot vacuum in the middle of the room is much less abrasive when it blends in with the walls.\nWinner: Saros 10\nSaros 10 vs. 10R: Cost\nThe Roborock Saros 10 and 10R both cost $1,599.99 \u2014 not sure if that makes your decision easier or harder. The scales could tip if one gets its first big discount before the other.\nWinner: Tie\nOur winner: Roborock Saros 10R\nIf you're really going to make me pick between them, I would pick the Saros 10R over the Saros 10. At the end of the day, if I needed a vacuum to reliably clean up the litter box area or deal with a wet or dry spill near the kitchen counter, I'd send the Saros 10R every time.\nThe slight edge that the Saros 10 has in suction power isn't nearly as game-changing as the edge that the Saros 10R has in mopping. If you're a finicky clean freak like I am, the Saros 10R is going to get your floors to a more comforting level of barefoot-ready, including the nasty edges and corners that keep you awake at night.\nYou're in good hands either way \u2014 the Saros 10 and Saros 10R are two of the best robot vacuums I've ever tested. They're keeping some respect on the Saros legacy amid the Saros Z70's flop of a release. If Roborock wisely combines the best features of the Saros 10 and 10R next year, that beast will be hard to beat. But as of mid-2025, either is a fantastic choice \u2014 and a better value than the Saros Z70 by a long shot."

      "text": "What's the best robot vacuum and mop? I have 5 top picks and 1 clear winner.\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nDespite the enthusiasm of actors in Swiffer commercials, few people are smiling when the time comes to mop their hardwood and tile floors. So if you're already considering buying a robot vacuum because it'll take one major chore off your to-do list, then you can probably see why the best robot vacuum and mop would be doubly worth it.\nI'm not saying that you can expect every robot vacuum that mops to scrub your kitchen grout with the same tenacity as you could by hand with a toothbrush. But the best mopping robot vacuums have gotten much better over the past few years. Many have smart mopping settings that unleash deeper scrubbing on specified spills or stains, and some even use AI sensors to assess whether a mess has been sufficiently cleaned. You can also set your robot vacuum to take multiple passes over dirty floors in the app's settings \u2014 one of my go-to tips for making your vacuum work better.\nHybrid robot vacuums' self-emptying docks are also getting far more advanced. The best robot mop combos will also automatically wash and dry their mopping pads, self-dispense cleaning liquid, and then refill themselves with clean water from the dock. In theory, mopping pad maintenance should be nearly as automated as the cleaning itself.\nI've personally tested more than 25 robot vacuum and mop combos in my own apartment, and I've narrowed your options down to just five robovacs.\nSo if you want to walk around barefoot, make pet hair disappear, and keep hardwood floors shiny and clean, then these are the best robot vacuum and mop combos to buy in 2025.\nI've been testing robot vacuums for Mashable since 2019 \u2014 most recently in a three-bedroom, two-cat apartment.\nAll of these vacuums were tested for at least four weeks. I put them through a series of standardized tests that cover the four main pillars of robot vacuum competence, while also considering overall bang for your buck.\nEach vacuum tackles various spills, debris, levels of pet hair, and floor types. I also tested hybrid vacuum and mop combo models on various stains and spills.\nI keep tabs on navigational accuracy when it comes to smart mapping my home, finding specific rooms and zones, and identifying small obstacles using LiDAR or cameras.\nYour new robot vacuum should be a polite houseguest. I make sure each vacuum isn't too loud, an eyesore, or generally a pain to use.\nMany robot vacuums automate their own dust bin emptying, mopping pad washing, and more \u2014 the more self-sufficient they are, the better.\nRoborock Saros 10R\nBest overall\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Barely over three inches tall\n- Dual spinning mopping pads scrub corners and edges closely\n- Self-emptying and mop washing are quieter than competitors\n- Barely ever gets lost\n- Doesn't usually upturn small rugs and bath mats\n- Auto-dispenses detergent\n- Livestream pet camera is actually pretty useful\n- Very slow mopping\n- Clean water tank drains quickly\n- Small obstacle avoidance still isn't perfect\n- Pet hair pickup on low pile could be better\n- Dock's slightly curved top prevents things from being set on it\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Roborock Saros 10R or my comparison piece of the Roborock Saros 10 vs. Saros 10R.\nWho it's for\nThis isn't just the best robot vacuum and mop. It's the best robot vacuum I've ever tested, period. If you have pets or combination flooring, you won't find a better floor cleaner.\nThe 2025 Roborock Saros 10R will satisfy people who prioritize true wall-to-wall cleaning with literally no corners cut. The flexible spinning mopping pads on the Saros 10R make it one of the rare robot mop combos that can actually mop in 90-degree angles and along edges. So if your high standards for barefoot readiness extend to the outskirts of your hard floors, the Saros 10R's hefty price tag could feel worth it to you.\nWith other premium features like way-above-average suction power, self-washing and drying mopping pads, and a livestream pet camera, the Saros 10R is an exhaustive floor suite that would flourish in lived-in homes with complex furniture, hardwood-to-rug layouts, heavy foot traffic, or paw traffic. If your home is fully carpeted except for the kitchen and a bathroom, it's probably overkill.\nWhy we picked this\nRoborock's expertise in the automated mopping sphere has evolved to corner cleaning, which I first experienced with the 2024 Qrevo Master and now with the 2025 Saros 10R. This 90-degree and edge detailing is performed by a hinged spinning mopping pad that reaches out from under the robot vacuum to scoot into corners where the circular bot otherwise can't fit.\nCompared to many hybrid models I've tested that just kind of mop aimlessly, I've watched the Saros 10R wipe spills under my kitchen counter and diligently lap up fine dust and hairs that always float to the outskirts of rooms. This flexible mopping pad design is also the main reason why I'd recommend the Saros 10R over the Saros 10, whose singular mopping pad was more likely to smear spills in my testing.\nThe Saros 10R also does a great job on spots that need to be simultaneously vacuumed and mopped. Its impressive 20,000 Pa of suction power and double spinning mops work together to create a balance of sweeping and scrubbing, which worked wonders on messes like a giant pile of soil left after re-potting a plant in my living room. As one of the most powerful options on the market, the Saros 10R can really ensure dry pet-related debris is cleared before wet cleaning comes through, making it the best robot vacuum and mop for pet hair that I've ever tested.\nMy cats also love making similar messes when digging in those same plants \u2014 and with the Saros 10R's livestream pet camera, I can keep an eye on them when I'm not home.\nDetails\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nAffordable self-washing and drying station\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Often on sale for under $700\n- Automatic water refill and mop pad washing/drying\n- 8,000 Pa suction power is pretty strong for this price range\n- Multiple suction power and water level modes\n- Affordable small obstacle avoidance\n- Initial mapping run is quite accurate on first try\n- Loud automatic emptying\n- Sometimes mistakes small rugs for obstacles\n- Only has a single roller brush\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Eufy X10 Pro Omni.\nWho it's for\nAs the best budget robot vacuum and mop (relatively speaking), the Eufy X10 Pro Omni will appeal to a specific group of people \u2014 those doing a balancing act between budget and automation. If you're down to splurge past a few hundred dollars to outsource not only mopping, but also cleaning those soggy mopping pads, Eufy's flagship model from 2024 is the rare option that'll bring that home for less than $700.\nFor large homes where a majority of the flooring demands both mopping and vacuuming, the exceptional battery life here will really sweeten the deal. It's well-suited for homes with multiple stories or just a lot of square footage. And thanks to its advanced self-empty dock, the X10 Pro Omni will be able to clean in a variety of intensity modes for at least two hours without needing to charge.\nWhy we picked this\nEufy's first stab at the fully self-sufficient tank and mopping system \u2014 the main thing that separates average hybrids from premium hybrids \u2014 was a major win. Past the self-cleaning dock, I was surprised to see a hybrid in this price range with dual spinning mopping pads, which scrub a little more ferociously than stationary pads. Eufy's new hybrid had no issues wiping up splatters of buffalo sauce, dusty paw prints, and small chunks of wet cat food off of hardwood floor.\nSuccess on the tiled bathroom floor was hindered by overly cautious obstacle avoidance that mistook a bath mat for a towel and refused to even vacuum the area. Even so, having small obstacle avoidance at all is still crucial for confidently sending the robot vacuum out to clean when you're not home to get it unstuck. No laptop chargers or socks were harmed in my apartment, even when set directly in front of the X10 Pro Omni's cleaning path on purpose.\nDetails\nRoomba Plus 505 Combo\nBest Roomba vacuum and mop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Finally, a Roomba with spinning mops\n- iRobot's mall obstacle avoidance is the most accurate I've tried\n- LiDAR mapping correctly identifies specific rooms\n- Lifts mop pads when rugs are sensed\n- Frequently returns to dock to wash mops mid-session\n- Auto-emptying sound is painfully loud\n- Pad washing cycle is also louder than most\n- Sometimes still dampens edges of rugs\n- Single brush roll is a downgrade from two on the Combo 10 Max\nWho it's for\nFor those who are set on getting a Roomba over any other top vacuum brand, the Roomba Plus 505 Combo is the best Roomba value on the market right now. Compared to other mopping Roombas, it's one of the only models with spinning mopping pads.\niRobot also has the most accurate small obstacle avoidance technology that I've tested to date \u2014 a huge relief if you're concerned about your vacuum tripping on things like cords, socks, or pet waste if you haven't tidied up beforehand. If your budget is firmly capped at $1,000, this is probably the smartest robot vacuum you'll find in that price range.\nWhy we picked this\nThis the most well-rounded Roomba I've seen in years with the most practical price tag I've ever seen on a premium Roomba. iRobot finally read the room and realized that people don't care so much about the cool-looking lifting mop arm of the Roomba Combo j7 or Combo 10 Max \u2014 they just want legitimate scrubbing, which most reliably comes from a dual spinning mop pad setup (over a singular flat pad). iRobot estimates that this helps the 505 reach 18 percent closer edge cleaning than that of former mopping Roombas, and I've seen it play out in real time as the 505 swung one of those pads right up against my kitchen counters, along the bathtub wall, and even the edge of the litter box.\nIf you're not in a rush, iRobot's SmartScrub feature also really shines with the double pad design. Here, the Roomba will do a double take over stickier messes that probably wouldn't be sufficiently wiped up in one pass. I've also noticed that the 505 goes back to the dock to rinse its mops mid-cleaning session more often than other robot mops. I'd rather cleaning take longer than for ranch or wine to be accidentally dragged across my entire kitchen.\nIn a never-before-seen design change, most of the new Roombas have a circular tower on top. That indicates that Roombas are finally using LiDAR for smart mapping, making room-to-room navigation more accurate (despite the fact that the new Roomba Home app somehow looks more antiquated than the older app). But I'm just happy that iRobot's small obstacle avoidance is just as solid as it's always been. The Roomba 505 successfully dodged all of the socks and cords I threw at it \u2014 tests that even the most advanced Roborocks I've tried still fail from time to time.\nDetails\nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum & Mop\nBest Shark robot vacuum and mop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $400\n- Matrix Mode crosshatch pattern is great for spot cleaning\n- Sonic scrubbing is pretty advanced for a budget vacuum\n- Mops with cleaning solution, which is included\n- Very quick LiDAR mapping\n- Can't vacuum and mop at the same time\n- Requires rug verification run to avoid mopping rugs\n- Sometimes takes forever to find dock\n- Since been replaced by flagship PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1.\nWho it's for\nWe first reviewed this hybrid robot vacuum and 2023, and we just can't quit it. It still spot cleans and mops better than vacuums two or three times as expensive. Though, we should note that if you're looking for the best Shark robot vacuum and mop, the company's flagship PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro is technically the more advanced cleaning machine.\nBut if you can live without a fancy self-cleaning dock that deals with soggy mopping pads so long as your robot mop actually scrubs the floor well, then consider the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1. This budget hybrid vacuum and mop will do a more meticulous job than other hybrids in the same price range.\nWhile the Shark Matrix 2-in-1 is safe to send into fully carpeted rooms, you also have to manually draw a no-mopping box around every single rug on the map. People in homes with a complex rug situation may want to opt for a more advanced bot that automatically stops mopping when it senses soft floors.\nWhy we picked this\nYou can think of the Matrix Clean system as the robot vacuum embodiment of the \"and one for good measure\" approach when it comes to cleaning. Despite its entry-level price point, the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 proved itself in my at-home cleaning tests, particularly when it came to spot cleaning. Activating Matrix cleaning mode while mopping triggers the mopping pad to vibrate 100 times per minute and go over the desired area multiple times. When I'm wiping up a spill with a paper towel by hand, I wouldn't settle for a single, initial wipe. Why should my robot vacuum?\nIn Matrix mode during regular vacuuming, these Shark models dish out 30 percent better carpet cleaning than the older RV Shark models by vacuuming in a crosshatch pattern to loosen and grab debris from multiple angles.\nThough the cleaning obviously wasn't as deep as the more premium Shark PowerDetect that came out more than a year later, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 always did a sufficient job at light daily upkeep of kitty litter in my bathroom or minor drops on my hardwood kitchen floor. In fact, I found myself reaching for this Shark over the similarly-priced Roombas that I was testing at the same time \u2014 they were missing stuff way more often.\nDetails\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro\nBest to buy on sale\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Regularly goes on sale for under $700\n- Large wheels let it navigate over rugs\n- Mopping pads automatically lift up over carpets\n- Features Shark's signature spot cleaning\n- Very reliable suction on hard floors, carpets, and area rugs\n- Floor cleaning solution included\n- Uses a lot of water during the mopping process, leaving floors damp\n- The dock announces what it's doing, which can be annoying\nWho it's for\nThese days, every vacuum brand has to have a 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop that can wash and dry its own mopping pads, and the PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro is Shark's answer to this industry trend. When it's on sale for $699, it's one of the more affordable vacuums with this technology.\nWhile it's more expensive, this Shark robot vacuum and mop combo is a big step up from the brand's mid-range vacuums, which can't vacuum and mop at the same time. It also uses spinning mopping pads for a deeper clean than its predecessors, and without getting your carpets wet. You can let it run for 60 days without needing to empty or refill it.\nIf you have a larger home with a lot of hardwood floors \u2014 or if you really hate the idea of spending $1,000 or more on a vacuum \u2014 then grab Shark's flagship robovac the next time it's on sale.\nWhy we picked this\nMashable recently named this product the best Shark robot vacuum and mop. Yes, the Matrix 2-in-1 will be a smarter pick for smaller homes and shoppers on a budget, but it can't touch the more modern feature set of this hybrid. It can self-empty, self-clean, self-dry, refill its water tank, and use cleaning solution for an extra deep clean.\nThere's a lot more to love about this vacuum. First, it carries over Shark's incredible spot cleaning tech from the Matrix robot vacuum series. It also lifts its behind up high, high above carpets to avoid leaving your rugs soggy. Finally, Shark outfitted this cleaner with its \"Never Stuck\" feature, and it's a capable navigator that can handle a large floor plan with ease.\nDetails\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nOther robot vacuums I've tested recently\nI've tested several other robot vacuum hybrids that didn't make the cut. Some, like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra, Roborock Qrevo Master, Narwal Freo X Ultra were top picks in this list at one point, but were merely upstaged in power and price tag value by newer models.\nI've also tested some 2025 robot vacuum releases that were OK, but weren't contenders for this list. The Dreame X50 Ultra grabbed attention during its CES 2025 debut for its ability to \"climb,\" though the fine print is that it can't scale thresholds taller than 6 millimeters (about 2.36 inches). The Roborock Saros 10 and 10R were able to hoist over the few thick doorway thresholds in my apartment just as well as the X50 Ultra. Its mopping and vacuuming capabilities are better than most mid-range robot vacuums, of course, but they weren't impressive enough for me to suggest the X50 Ultra in this list over either Saros model.\nI'm also in the process of testing the new fleet of 2025 Roombas. The Roomba Combo 205 DustCompactor wouldn't be a bad pick if you absolutely can't spare floor space for a self-empty dock. But for being one of iRobot's newest vacuums, I expected it to be a much smoother, smarter navigator.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes, if you get one with pressurized, vibrating, or spinning mopping pads.\nIn the early days of robotic vacuum mop combos, the automatic \"mopping\" wasn't much more than lightly dragging a damp cloth across the floor \u2014 I wouldn't exactly call it \"scrubbing.\" While that simplified approach is still present in the average budget robot vacuum and mop, the more premium robotic hybrid cleaners use advanced mechanics that better mimic the elbow grease that a human using a manual mop could provide.\nSince 2020-ish, most top robot vacuum brands have added a few automatic moppers to their lineup, spanning the pricing spectrum from as affordable as $200 to well over $1,000. Expectedly, the mopping technique gets more meticulous as the price goes up, so the soil level of your floors on any given day will play a big part in how much you should be spending on a 2-in-1 robotic cleaner. Are you mostly concerned with wiping up dust or easy spills, or will you be a stickler about dried-on stains or edge cleaning that call for more heavy-duty scrubbing?\nAt their core, robot vacuum mop combos are really just robot vacuums with an attached water reservoir and scrubbing pad. Thus, they work identically to regular robot vacuums on dry debris like crumbs and pet hair, but also dispense water or cleaning solution for mopping when on a hard floor.\nThe mopping mechanism can look a little different from there. Cheaper hybrid models require a person to manually attach a water tank or mopping pad to switch to mopping mode, while more advanced models always have mopping gear on board and are ready to start mopping whenever called upon. When the water tank is built in like that, these hybrid models are typically equipped with heightened floor type sensors and are smart enough to stay away from carpet or rugs while mopping while the hybrids that require manual swapping often need you to denote spots that they shouldn't mop through the app.\nOnce mopping is complete, there's a spectrum of maintenance that could be involved. The more basic budget hybrid models will require you to manually wash the mopping pad and refill the water tank after every cleaning session or two. More advanced combo models come with self-cleaning stations that wash and dry their own mopping pads and automatically refill its water tank each time the bot returns to the dock. You'll have to refill the clean water tank and empty the dirty water tank once every week or two, but most times, the robovac is ready to mop again immediately without human intervention.\nTrue 2-in-1 robot vacuums aren't to be confused with dedicated robot mops like iRobot's Braava Jet, which is often sold in a bundle with a Roomba. Rather, true hybrids are robot vacuums with a water reservoir and mopping pad attached somewhere. Some mop more intensely than others, but the bottom line is the same: They vacuum identically to their non-mopping counterparts, but also dispense water to wipe hard floors.\nFor instance, when eyeing a Roomba mop, it wouldn't make sense to choose the iRobot Braava Jet m6 over the similarly-priced Roomba Combo i5+ or Combo j5+. The Braava Jet m6 isn't a hybrid cleaner \u2014 it's just a mop that doesn't vacuum. In that case, you'd need to already have a robot vacuum, buy one, or do the vacuuming yourself before sending it out to mop. The Roomba, on the other hand, can do both, as well as empty itself and use small obstacle detection tech to avoid cords and pet waste. While either Combo's scrubbing may be slightly less meticulous than that of the Braava Jet m6, the discrepancy isn't enough to buy a standalone robotic mop.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "These 6 self-emptying robot vacuums were the most hands-off during my testing\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nThe best self-emptying robot vacuums speak to the life hack seeker in you. If vacuuming every day is something you don't feel like doing manually, you probably also don't feel like manually dumping a vac's dustbin into the trash every day. Such is the natural pipeline of being spoiled with technology.\nLet's set the scene: When you outsource vacuuming to a robotic vacuum cleaner, your floors get cleaned way more often, right? There's just one little downside to that extra attention: The more gunk picked up off the floor, the faster the dust bin fills up \u2014 especially if you have pets. You could either empty the dustbin yourself multiple times a week, or just get a robot vacuum that empties itself. These vacuum cleaners take care of vacuuming and bin maintenance on their own, storing the debris collected on each trip in a larger compartment that's located in the charging dock.\nMost brands claim capacities between six to eight weeks, but almost every auto-empty vacuum I've tried is self-sufficient for much longer than that. The feature is so core to the hands-off cleaning experience nowadays that it's rare for any new robot vacuum release to arrive to market without a self-emptying dock. Automatic emptying is the precursor to any of my tips for making your robot vacuum work better in general, and people on Reddit seem to agree that self-emptying vacuums are worth the convenience.\nThe best robot vacuum and mop combo models that auto-empty even take it a step further with auto-washing and -drying mopping pads and self-refilling water tanks, and it all goes down in the same dock where the robot vac empties itself. If your home's a tight squeeze, you certainly don't need such a full-fledged auto-empty dock (you don't even need to skip self-emptying altogether). I've tested a ton of solid self-emptying robot vacuums for small spaces in my own apartment.\nI've been testing the latest and greatest self-emptying robot vacuums from 2025 against the top vacs from years prior. Three-quarters of the way through 2025, these top six picks offered the most efficient automated cleaning experience in my home.\nI've been testing robot vacuums for Mashable since 2019 \u2014 most recently in a three-bedroom, two-cat apartment.\nAll of these vacuums were tested for at least four weeks. I put them through a series of standardized tests that cover the four main pillars of robot vacuum competence, while also considering overall bang for your buck.\nEach vacuum tackles various spills, debris, levels of pet hair, and floor types. I also tested hybrid vacuum and mop combo models on various stains and spills.\nI keep tabs on navigational accuracy when it comes to smart mapping my home, finding specific rooms and zones, and identifying small obstacles using LiDAR or cameras.\nYour new robot vacuum should be a polite houseguest. I make sure each vacuum isn't too loud, an eyesore, or generally a pain to use.\nMany robot vacuums automate their own dust bin emptying, mopping pad washing, and more \u2014 the more self-sufficient they are, the better.\nRoborock Saros 10R\nBest robot vacuum right now\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Vacuum itself is very slim\n- Washes and dries its mopping pads\n- 20,000 Pa suction is destroys others in this list\n- Self-emptying noise is quieter than most\n- Impeccable edge and corner mopping\n- Barely ever gets lost\n- Livestream pet camera is actually pretty useful\n- Very slow mopping\n- Clean water tank drains quickly\n- Small obstacle avoidance still isn't perfect\n- Pet hair pickup on low pile could be better\n- Dock's slightly curved top prevents things from being set on it\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Roborock Saros 10 or my comparison piece of the Roborock Saros 10 vs. Saros 10R.\nWho it's for\nThe 2025 Roborock Saros 10R would make the most sense for people who are serious about barefoot readiness and the hands-off cleaning experience as a whole \u2014 serious enough to invest in one of the priciest vacuums on the market. If you've ever cringed watching a robot vacuum lazily attempt and fail to sweep up the ball of crumbs and pet hair that blew into the corner, this is the attention to detail you're craving.\nWith way-above-average suction power, self-sustaining mopping pads, and a livestream pet camera, the Saros 10R is an exhaustive floor suite that would flourish in lived-in homes with complex room layouts, heavy foot traffic (or paw traffic), and a high possibility of stuff on the floor at any given time. Otherwise, it's probably overkill.\nWhy we picked this\nRoborock finally diverted from the pass\u00e9 matte plastic dock that we're used to and instead went with a chic mirrored finish. That's not fully why I chose the Saros 10R, but it's definitely a selling point if you prioritize harmony within your decor. Plus, the noise the dock makes during automatic emptying is undoubtedly the least painful I've heard.\nFirst off, the Saros 10R's 20,000 Pa of suction power simply runs laps around most of the competition, even doubling the suction power of my previous top pick, the Roborock Qrevo Master. This proved highly effective in fully sucking up debris from kitty litter to kibble to large Goldfish crackers to a large pile of soil after re-potting a plant. For those concerned with pet hair pickup, my Saros 10R actually performed significantly better on higher-pile rugs than it did on low pile.\nBut I personally like the Saros 10R because of its mopping skills. Specifically, I'm referring to corner mopping. Scrubbing corners and wiping up splatters along the edges of my kitchen has been a consistent struggle with almost all of the hybrids I've tested, but the 10R's retractable spinning side mop actually reaches out past the edge of the circular vacuum.\nDetails\n3i G10+\nBest robot vacuum for small spaces\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Occasionally on sale for under $400\n- 18,000 Pa suction power is wicked at any price point\n- Deals with dust for 60+ days without an auto-empty dock\n- Reliable small obstacle avoidance\n- Live stream pet camera is so rare at this price\n- Smart mapping is incredibly accurate and detailed\n- Can be stored under furniture\n- Physical design isn't exactly chic\n- Mopping is pretty basic\nOur review\nRead my review of the 3i G10+.\nWho it's for\nIf you're set on spending less than $500 on a robot vacuum, there are few reasons to not go with the 3i G10+. Between its ability to get around in small, cluttered spaces and its dust-compacting, space-saving design, the 3i G10+ would particularly be a great pick for apartments.\nThis niche, inexpensive pick also eclipses any other robot vacuum under $500 in the pet hair department \u2014 and even has stronger suction power than many premium robot vacuums. While it'd be a great pick for homes with a lot of carpeting or rugs, it can be ruled out for large homes with lots of hard floors and heavy-duty mopping needs.\nWhy we picked this\nAfter my underwhelming experience with the Roomba 205 DustCompactor, I was itching to find a smarter robot vacuum with the same dust-compacting element. And 3i nailed it. While the 3i G10+'s is cool because it saves you the floor space a self-empty dock would take up, that's hardly the G10+'s only monumental feature.\nFor such an inexpensive robot vacuum I was thoroughly impressed by the G10+'s perceptive navigation around my apartment. Its initial mapping run of the rooms was almost 100% accurate \u2014it even recognized beds, credenzas, and toilets all on its own, and automatically remembered where all of the rugs were. The 3i G10+ is also the incredibly rare budget option with small obstacle avoidance that can steer clear of cords or socks, plus pet waste (I tested this with fake brown sugar). But small obstacle avoidance isn't the only high-end feature 3i squeezed in here here \u2014 there's also a livestream pet camera. That was firmly a $1,000+ robot vacuum feature until now.\nAll of that brainpower isn't just fluff, either. The G10+ is a beast at cleaning. Its 18,000 Pa of suction power is super high for this price range, and you can tell that the G10+ is working hard as it moves extra meticulously when carpet is sensed, or during zone cleaning.\nDetails\nEufy E20 3-in-1\nBest if you also want a stick vacuum\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $400\n- Shockingly affordable for a robot and stick vacuum combo\n- Suction power of both vacuums is powerful for the price\n- 75 day self-empty dust capacity\n- Room by room smart mapping is quite accurate\n- Dock is very compact\n- Doesn't mop\n- A bit loud\n- Exposed motor isn't the most aesthetically appealing design\n- Have to come up with storage for the stick vacuum piece\n- Can't avoid chargers or other cables\nOur review\nRead my review of the Eufy E20 3-in-1.\nWho it's for\nMost of us know, deep down, that the ideal home cleaning setup involves both the daily hands-off convenience of a robot vacuum and the detail-oriented freedom of an upright vacuum. If you're having trouble choosing between them, the Eufy E20 3-in-1 is a really strategic way to maximize space and a mid-range budget. It'll get serious daily use if your idea of a clean home goes past the floors to crevices like windowsills, car seats, staircases, and couch cushions.\nThe Eufy E20 is a robot vacuum that doesn't mop, so the target buyer should consider the number of high-traffic hard floors in their home. If it's mostly carpeting and rugs, you might settle for skipping mopping to secure the self-emptying robot-turned-stick vacuum setup.\nWhy we picked this\nThe package Eufy brought to the CES 2025 table has turned out to be the most underrated robot vacuum of 2025 so far. At $649.99, the Eufy E20 3-in-1 is several hundred dollars less than most of its mid-tier competitors coming out this year \u2014 and less than half the price of the high-end Dreame and Roborock models released alongside it at CES. That price would be decent for any self-emptying robot vacuum with smart mapping by itself, let alone the fact that it's technically also a self-emptying cordless stick vacuum. No Dyson vacuum can say that.\nSwitching between them just involves pulling the motor out of the robot vacuum body and clicking it onto one of the included attachments. After the robot vac returns from a cleaning or the motor is secured back into the vacuum after handheld use, the dock automatically empties the dust bin for up to 75 days before you need to step in. I appreciate the fact that the dustbin is transparent and that every cleaning run is started with a clean slate \u2014 it provides unequivocal proof of how much either vacuum was able to scrounge up off my floors.\nNo one's claiming that the Eufy E20 in robot vacuum mode or cordless stick mode will be the most powerful that you can buy. We already know that its real power lies in the range of cleaning it offers. But for the price, its suction specs aren't too shabby: At 8,000 Pa, it vacuums with the same amount of suction power as the 2024 Eufy X10 Pro Omni that thoroughly impressed me during testing. Pickup rate of fine debris along edges and long hairs on rugs could be better, but the E20 reliably took care of all visible crumbs, rocks, and loose dust bunnies on my flat rugs, hardwood, and tile. I tended to switch to the upright cleaning head and its 30,000 Pa of suction power to tackle rugs with heavy layers of cat hair.\nOn the smart mapping front, the Eufy E20 excels at getting to the right spot. It created a near-perfect map of my three-bedroom, three-bath apartment on the first try. After I added an extra border or two in the app, the E20 accurately made its way to selected spots on a daily basis without getting stuck on a bath mat or under a bed.\nDetails\nRoborock Q10 S5+\nQuietest robot vacuum\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for $379.99\n- Very quiet when vacuuming and self-emptying\n- Five-digit suction power is rare in this price range\n- Affordable small obstacle avoidance for cords and pet waste\n- Sonic mopping actually scrubs with pressure\n- LiDAR smart mapping is quick, accurate, and color-coded\n- Mopping is thorough, but pad gets gross quickly\n- Not very slim\nWho it's for\nThis Roborock model is ideal for budget shoppers with low-intensity cleaning needs \u2014 it's often on sale for less than $400. It'd be best in a low-foot-traffic home or an apartment that doesn't have a ton of pet hair, and is a great vacuum for hardwood floors. Its self-empty dock is easily the most compact in this list, taking up less than two feet of floor space.\nWhy we picked this\nIf you've ever stood beside a particularly loud robot vacuum while it empties the dust bin, you know the jump scare it can be. (If you haven't, be thankful.) Roborock has managed to perfect the muffled auto-empty whoosh, the quietest I've tested being the Roborock Q10 S5+. The self-emptying dock is so compact that I could set it up under my couch's chaise, and the noise level is low enough not to disturb the person watching TV right beside it.\nRoborock has confirmed that the Q10 S5+ is the 2025 version of the popular Roborock Q8 Max+ from a few years ago. The main upgrade lies in doubled suction power, reaching 10,000 Pa \u2014 the same as the 2024 flagship Roborock Qrevo Master that I loved. Despite the stronger suction, the Q10 S5+ isn't a loud vacuum, either. I can barely hear it if I walk out of the room, but always come back to proof that it did, in fact, clean in there. It has left both litter box areas in my apartment spotless on multiple occasions and wiped away hard floor stains and spills that other cheap robot vacuum and mop combos leave behind.\nThe color-coded home map in the Roborock app also shows the exact cleaning path that its robot vacs take. It's the most intuitive robot vacuum app that I've tried, and I have yet to struggle with the Q10 S5+ not navigating to the correct room or spot cleaning zone. Small obstacle avoidance and automatic carpet detection when mopping are two bonuses for a budget-friendly vacuum.\nDetails\niRobot Roomba Plus 505 Combo\nBest self-emptying Roomba\nThe Good & The Bad\n- A rare Roomba with spinning mops\n- iRobot's small obstacle avoidance is the most accurate I've tried\n- LiDAR mapping correctly identifies specific rooms\n- Lifts mop pads when rugs are sensed\n- Frequently returns to dock to wash mops mid-session\n- Auto-emptying sound is painfully loud\n- Pad washing cycle is also louder than most\n- Sometimes still dampens edges of rugs\nWho it's for\nFor those doing brand-specific shopping, the Roomba Plus 505 Combo is one of the best bangs for your buck that iRobot has dropped in a long time. It would be ideal for homes with varying floor types and multiple rooms that require thorough, frequent mopping. Because iRobot's small obstacle avoidance is the most accurate I've tried, you may take the Roomba route if a main concern is avoiding tricky roadblocks like pet waste or cords.\nI wouldn't recommend the Roomba Plus 505 Combo for tight-knit spaces with thin walls. Not because it's overly bulky, but because iRobot still hasn't figured out how to make its auto-empty noise quieter.\nWhy we picked this\niRobot was one of the first brands to pull up to the self-emptying scene back in 2019 \u2014 in fact, the Roomba s9+ was the first self-emptying robot vacuum I ever tested. For a few years after that, though, the premium high-end Roombas were too expensive for their feature list. But iRobot came back down to earth with its latest Roomba drop from 2025, and I've been particularly impressed with the Plus 505 Combo \u2014 especially considering the fact that it goes on sale for $599.99.\nIt's uncharacteristic for a Roomba to have a double mopping pad setup, but iRobot was smart to make that shift here. I'm not alone in thinking that spinning mopping pads scrub more thoroughly than a flat pad, and the lifting cloth seen on the Roomba j7 series wasn't thick enough to put a real dent in large messes. The Plus 505 Combo does a much better job at mopping in corners and along edges, specifically (I witnessed it several times under my kitchen counters and along hall walls).\nThe close edge cleaning could also be attributed to this Roomba having a better idea of what the room looks like in the first place, thanks to iRobot's surprising switch to LiDAR-based smart mapping. However, iRobot's real navigational win has always been dodging small obstacles like pet waste, cords, small toys, and socks. In my experience, any Roomba's small obstacle avoidance is just unbeatably accurate, successfully pinpointing thin iPhone chargers that even the most expensive Roborock vacuums sometimes run over.\nDetails\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nBudget pick with self-washing and drying mopping pads\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $700\n- 8,000 Pa suction power wows in this price range\n- Affordable AI obstacle avoidance\n- Automatic water refill and mop pad washing/drying\n- Can mop while vacuuming with multiple intensity modes\n- Loud automatic emptying\n- Mistakes small rugs for obstacles\n- Still only has a single roller brush\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Eufy X10 Pro Omni.\nWho it's for\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is a seriously clutch find for shoppers who prioritize a \"set it and forget it\" robot vacuum experience and are willing to pay more than $500 \u2014 but not toe the $1,000 mark \u2014 for that peace of mind. The hands-off experience here includes automatic avoidance of small obstacles like cords and a self-washing and drying mopping pad system. The fanciest-ever Eufy vac offers both these features for as low as $679.99 on sale.\nBetween the large water tank and a battery life that outruns (sometimes even doubles) many pricier competitors, the X10 Pro Omni is a smart choice for large homes with multiple stories. You can squeeze hours of cleaning out of the X10 Pro without it returning to the dock to refill or recharge. A substantial chunk of that square footage would ideally be hard floors, as this Eufy's dual pressurized mopping pad system doesn't deserve to collect dust (cleaning pun definitely intended).\nWhy we picked this\nThis is the first time any Eufy robot vacuum's self-emptying dock can also self-refill the bot's water tank and self-wash and dry the mop pads. The self-washing and drying aspect, especially, is a bullet point that's rarely seen in the sub-$1,000 price range \u2014 the other robot vacuums that debuted at CES 2024 are evidence of that. Even iRobot's $1,399 Roomba Combo j9+ doesn't do that.\nAs impressive as the all-in-one station is, the X10 Pro Omni's cleaning proficiency is also noteworthy. In terms of suction power, 8,000 Pa is quite high, not just in this price range but in general. The power proved itself in my testing, successfully removing matted-down cat hair from a low-pile rug and spilled rice from a medium-pile rug and surrounding hardwood flooring, including against the wall. During mopping, the spinning mopping pads were able to wipe up spilled wine that had been drying for several hours, as well as visibly remove dusty cat paw prints near the litter box.\nThe presence of small obstacle avoidance seals the X10 Pro Omni's bang for your buck status. It's another feature rarely seen at this price point. I cherish this feature a little extra, as there's bound to be a phone charger, catnip mouse, or blanket tufts on my floor at any given moment. Aside from a blip involving a bath mat mistaken for a towel (and an annoying quirk in the Eufy app that doesn't let you dismiss an incorrectly-pinged obstacle), the X10 Pro Omni accurately identified and avoided most cords and socks in my home.\nDetails\nTopics Robot Vacuums Vacuums\nOther robot vacuums I've tested recently\nI've tested several other robot vacuums that auto-empty that didn't make the cut. Some, like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra, Roborock Qrevo Master, Narwal Freo X Ultra, and Roomba j7+ were top picks in this list at one point, but were merely upstaged in power and price tag value by newer models.\nI've also tested some 2025 robot vacuum releases that were OK, but didn't wow enough to be contenders for this list. The Dreame X50 Ultra grabbed attention during its CES 2025 debut for its ability to \"climb,\" though the fine print is that it can't scale thresholds taller than 6 millimeters (about 2.36 inches). A slew of new Dreame robot vacuums are slated to come out in fall 2025, among them a model with improved climbing abilities and a model whose self-empty dock can hold three sets of mopping pads. I'll be getting my hands on these as soon as possible and updating my top picks for this list accordingly.\nAre self-emptying robot vacuums worth it?\nA robot vacuum that can empty its own dust bin is for sure worth it in just about every home \u2014 no one should have to settle for an add-on task related to the gadget they just bought to automate another chore. However, automatic emptying is particularly valuable in homes with pets. Daily pet hair pickup could easily fill up a vacuum's tiny onboard dustbin after just a few rooms, but that capacity is significantly expanded when there's a large alternate dustbin on the dock. If they get full mid-cleaning session, self-emptying vacuums know to head back to the dock to unload, then finish the rest of the session with a clean slate.\nNot for nothing, even the most ergonomic upright vacuums are a pain to wrestle out of the closet sometimes. In a pinch, it's inarguably worthwhile to have the option to start sweeping with a click on an app.\nFor people with allergies, auto-emptying also spares you from inhaling the inevitable puff of dust that emerges when dumping a dustbin into the trash. Speaking of avoiding the grosser parts of the job, if you're specifically seeking a robot vacuum that mops, many self-emptying docks also take it upon themselves to wash and dry the dirty mopping pads after the job is done.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nSelf-emptying robot vacuums clean just like regular robot vacuums, returning to their docks to charge without your involvement. The dock they're coming back to is where things get fancy: You should be able to run your robot vacuum for weeks at a time without worrying about emptying anything.\nBecause robot vacuums typically aren't more than four inches tall, there's not room inside to fit a dust bin as large as the ones on an cordless stick vacuum. Naturally, the smaller the dust bin, the faster it fills up \u2014 most dustbins onboard a robot vacuum don't exceed a half liter and require manual emptying every few sweeping sessions (or every single time if you have pets).\nThere are two main ways to empty a self-empty robot vacuum bin when it's finally full, and you can shop for your self-emptying robot vacuum based on personal preference. Some have disposable bags that can be thrown away and replaced with a new one, while others are bagless and will require dumping into the trash. The first is a little more hygienic and a little less triggering to allergies, while the latter is more eco-friendly and won't require paying for replacements on a regular basis.\nAmazon actually didn't end up buying iRobot \u2014 the two ditched the acquisition at the beginning of 2024. While the dud of a deal does have people wondering if iRobot as a business is still sustainable for the long haul, it surely isn't affecting the attention Roombas get at Amazon: Amazon puts the top Roombas on sale for up to 50% off frequently throughout the year.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "Best robot vacuums for apartments, tested in my apartment\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nThe 10 minutes it takes to manually vacuum a tight space probably isn't enough to send someone over the edge as far as chores are concerned. While the time-saving factor may be a moot point here, it doesn't completely diminish the appeal of getting a robot vacuum for a small apartment.\nBut don't automatically assume that less floor to cover means that the cheapest vacuum you can find will suffice. Cramped furniture arrangements and quick changes between floor types actually call for a robot vacuum that's relatively good at navigating, or you'll risk coming home to a vacuum that got stuck in kitchen chair legs during the first five minutes of cleaning.\nAre robot vacuums worth it in apartments?\nYes, there are several quiet, compact robot vacuums that would assimilate smoothly into apartment life. One could even argue that spaces with less square footage get dirty faster because virtually every spot is a high-traffic spot. If your small apartment has hard floors, a robot vacuum and mop combo is a genius way to downsize chore supplies.\nLastly, I'll die on the hill that smart mapping is still a non-negotiable feature in a space with just a few rooms. The ability to clean just the bathroom or just the kitchen is a level of customization that anyone would appreciate, especially if multiple floor types are involved. And without smart mapping technology, a robot vacuum won't be able to spot clean specific zones within those few rooms \u2014 you'd essentially be sending the robot vacuum out to clean the entire place just because your dog made a mess by the food bowl.\nNot sure which robot vacuum would be worth it in your small space? I've hands-on tested a ton of options in my own apartments over the years and have handpicked the three best robot vacuums for apartments, studios, and other one-story homes for 2025 so far.\nAs a senior shopping reporter, I have been testing popular robot vacuums for Mashable in the various apartments I've lived in since 2019 \u2014 most recently, a three-bedroom apartment where three people and two cats reside.\nOver the course of at least four weeks, each robot vacuum is put through a series of standardized tests that I\u2019ve laid out to exemplify all factors of trusting a robot vacuum in your home on a daily basis. In addition to overall bang for your buck, those tests cover four main pillars of robot vacuum competence:\nCleaning thoroughness: To encapsulate the full spectrum of messes a robot vacuum might encounter, each one is sent out to tackle various spills, debris, levels of pet hair, and more on multiple floor types. The vacs that mop perform extra tests on stains and spills.\nA robot vacuum\u2019s ability to get to the right spot in the first place is arguably as important as the cleaning itself. I keep tabs on navigational accuracy when it comes to smart mapping my home, finding specific rooms and zones, and identifying small obstacles.\nThe ideal robot vacuum will be a relatively seamless addition to your household. Because if it\u2019s loud, an eyesore, or generally a pain to use, you're not going to want it in your house at all.\nAnyone aiming to avoid manual sweeping may also want to avoid manual upkeep of a vacuum. Many robot vacuums automate their own dust bin emptying, mopping pad washing, and more \u2014 the more self-sufficient they are, the better.\n3i G10+\nBest budget robot vacuum for pet hair\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Occasionally on sale for under $400\n- 18,000 Pa suction power is wicked at any price point\n- Deals with dust for 60+ days without an auto-empty dock\n- Reliable small obstacle avoidance\n- Live stream pet camera is so rare at this price\n- Smart mapping is incredibly accurate and detailed\n- Can be stored under furniture\n- Physical design isn't the chicest\n- Mopping is pretty basic\nWho it's for\nSome one-bedroom and studio apartments are too tight of a squeeze to spare floor space for a self-empty dock (I've been there), but that doesn't mean you should be stuck with a robot vacuum that doesn't empty itself. The 3i G10+ is one of the few robot vacuums on the market that compacts its dust inside of itself, still leaving you off the hook from emptying for around two months. This feature would be great in small spaces where pets that shed a lot also reside \u2014 that, and the fact that the 3i G10+ has the most powerful suction power on this list by a long shot. While it'd be a great pick for homes with a lot of carpeting or rugs, it can be ruled out for large homes with lots of hard floors and heavy-duty mopping needs.\nIf you're particularly worried that your home is too cluttered for a robot vacuum to not get stuck, the 3i G10+'s ultra-perceptive smart mapping and small obstacle avoidance tech should be a relief.\nWhy we picked this\nI originally wanted to test the 3i G10+ because it \"self empties\" without a big dock hogging the floor. It's an undoubtedly cool space-saving hack, but the G10+ is so much more than a Roomba 205 dupe. In the few months that I've known it existed, I've already recommended it in far more situations than just small spaces.\nBefore cleaning even started, the G10+'s smart mapping provided a level of detail I know is crucial in small spaces with cramped room layouts. In my apartment, it differentiated between beds, couches, storage pieces like TV stands and credenzas, and even toilets \u2014 then cleaned around those obstacles accordingly (and under, when possible). It was also cool to watch the G10+ decipher between smaller obstacles live while cleaning, like socks and makeshift pet waste (brown sugar). But small obstacle avoidance isn't the only high-end feature generously included at such an accessible price point \u2014 there's also a livestream pet camera, which I've never seen in a robot vacuum for less than $1,000.\nWhen the G10+ makes it to the right spot (and it always does, in my experience), it is a beast at cleaning. Its 18,000 Pa of suction power is steep for this price range, and I appreciated watching the bot work more slowly when it sensed carpet \u2014 a great sign if you're dealing with pet hair. It mops too. Though the scrubbing itself isn't anything super intense, the small spinning corner mop is a nice touch that cheap robotic mops don't typically feature.\nDetails\nEufy E20 3-in-1\nBest for carpet and pet hair\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $400\n- Shockingly affordable for a robot and stick vacuum combo\n- Suction power of both vacuums is powerful for the price\n- 75-day self-empty dust capacity\n- Room by room smart mapping is quite accurate\n- Dock is very compact\n- Handheld attachment is stored right in the vacuum\n- Doesn't mop\n- A bit loud\n- Exposed motor isn't the most aesthetically appealing design\n- No built-in storage for the stick vacuum extender or cleaning head\n- Can't avoid chargers or other cables\nWho it's for\nIf you're picky about crevice cleaning, such as windowsills, couch cushions, or crumby desktops, your ideal vacuum setup probably involves a cordless vacuum to complement a robot vacuum's automated floor cleaning. If your home's storage space is proportionally as tight as your square footage, the Eufy E20 3-in-1 is a strategic way to maximize space on a mid-range budget.\nUnlike most other big 2025 robot vacuum releases, the Eufy E20 doesn't mop. So, the target buyer should consider the amount of high-traffic hard floors their home has. If a small bathroom and kitchen are the only non-carpeted rooms, you might settle for skipping mopping to secure the space-saving power of a self-emptying robot-turned-stick vacuum setup.\nWhy we picked this\nAny robot vacuum that can convert to a handheld and stick vacuum would probably be a bang for your buck at any price. The Eufy E20 is generously priced at $649.99 (and even less on sale) \u2014 that's less than half the price of the high-end Dreame and Roborock models released alongside it at CES 2025. $649.99 is also the MSRP of my favorite Dyson vacuum, which doesn't come with a self-empty dock.\nAt 8,000 Pa, it vacuums with the same amount of suction power as the 2024 Eufy X10 Pro Omni that thoroughly impressed me during testing. Pickup rate of fine debris along edges and long hairs on rugs could be better, but the E20 reliably took care of all visible crumbs, rocks, and loose dust bunnies on my flat rugs, hardwood, and tile. I tended to switch to the upright cleaning head and its 30,000 Pa of suction power to tackle rugs with heavy layers of pet hair, which only really responds to robot vacuums with 10,000 Pa or higher. I personally appreciate the fact that the dustbin is transparent and that every cleaning run is started with a clean slate \u2014 it provides unequivocal proof of how much either vacuum was able to scrounge up off my floors.\nOn the smart mapping front, the Eufy E20 excels at getting to the right spot. It created a near-perfect map of my three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment on the first try. I had to rework a few borders, but after that, the E20 accurately completed multiple spot cleanings on a daily basis without getting stuck under furniture or on a rug.\nDetails\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nBest compact self-cleaning station\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Often on sale for under $700\n- 8,000 Pa suction power is extraordinary in this price range\n- Affordable AI obstacle avoidance\n- Automatic water refill and mop pad washing/drying\n- Loud automatic emptying\n- Mistakes small rugs for obstacles\n- Still only has a single roller brush\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Eufy X10 Pro Omni.\nWho it's for\nSo you have enough hardwood or tile to justify a robot mop, and you really don't want to touch the soggy mopping pads all the time. Fair. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni has one of the most compact mop washing stations I've tested, and is on the more affordable side for a do-all dock \u2014 it goes for under $700 on sale.\nWhy we picked this\nEufy's most premium robot vacuum cleaner boasts potent suction power for this price range, an effective double mopping pad system, small object avoidance, and a self-emptying dock that also washes and dries the mopping pads. You typically won't see a robot vacuum and mop combo that checks off all of those boxes for less than $1,000, so Eufy deserves some serious credit for squeezing it all in at such a digestible price point.\nWhat's equally as impressive is that Eufy didn't cut corners on the performance of any of those features just to get them all on the list. It's one of the few hybrids armed with dual spinning mopping pads for more robust scrubbing than that of a single stationary pad, complete with an up-and-down mechanism that applies pressure during mopping and accurately lifts the pads completely above the surface when rugs or carpet are sensed. The 8,000 Pa suction power performed satisfactorily in multiple cleaning tests in my own apartment, including soaking up small wine and sauce spills, picking up crumbs of various sizes, and sweeping around the litter box daily.\nIn a small or crowded space, the X10 Pro Omni won't constantly get stuck. I had next to no issues when sending the X10 Pro Omni to specific rooms or zones for spot cleaning on the app, and Eufy's small obstacle avoidance was about 90 percent accurate when avoiding things like phone chargers and shoes. Bath mats were one thing the X10 Pro Omni was a little too cautious about, refusing to clean them because it thought they were towels (and the app doesn't let you dismiss incorrectly identified obstacles).\nDetails\nRoomba j7\nBest Roomba for small apartments\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Often on sale for under $300\n- Accurately avoids phone chargers and pet waste\n- Better obstacle avoidance than Roomba j6+\n- Maneuvers effectively in tight furniture setups\n- Option to buy j7+ or Combo j7+, which adds compact self-empty dock or mop\n- Reliably memorizes different rooms and zones\n- Have to create a zone for spot cleaning\n- Won't deep clean thick carpet\n- Clean Base emptying is wickedly loud (if you buy it)\nOur review\nRead my full review of the iRobot Roomba Combo j7+ (the self-emptying, mopping version of the j7).\nWho it's for\nRobot vacuums that require you to tidy up the floor before they can safely complete a cleaning run miss the point of automatic cleaning completely. In a small space, where the chance of rogue clutter being on the floor is high, a robot vacuum with reliable small obstacle avoidance will be game-changing.\nWhy we picked this\nI think iRobot's small obstacle avoidance is the best on the market, and the Roomba j7 is the most affordable way to bring that home in standalone form if you don't have a free corner to house a self-empty dock. (If you stumble across it on sale at Amazon, you'll likely be able to snag it for 50% off.) The j7 successfully avoided every charging cord, slipper, and laundry pile in my home \u2014 a helping hand I appreciate every time I decide on a last-minute clean and don't have time to run around and grab stuff off the floor.\nThe j7's broader navigation in terms of maneuvering around furniture and accurately mapping rooms (or non-walled areas like the entryway) is similarly reliable. Its cleaning prowess is enough for light daily upkeep, but if one of your main cleaning concerns has to do with the thick mound of pet hair that's taking over your small space, you may want to check out the more powerful models in my list of robot vacuums that are specifically great for carpet.\nDetails\nShark Matrix RV2300\nBest Shark robot vacuum for small spaces\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Often on sale for under $200\n- Tiny dock can wedge into very small free space\n- Compact self-emptying version available for $299 on sale\n- Super affordable and accurate LiDAR\n- Matrix Cleaning goes over extra soiled spots from multiple angles\n- Onboard dust bin occasionally leaks crumbs\n- Might wrestle with small rugs\n- Simply isn't going to deep clean carpet\nWho it's for\nBudget shoppers trying to stick near $200 still don't have to settle for a botvac that's perpetually disoriented. The Shark Matrix RV2300 maps incredibly accurately and in my experience, is an extremely reliable spot cleaner in terms of navigating to the selected area on the map as well as the vacuuming itself.\nBecause this compact standalone version doesn't have an auto-empty dock (the self-emptying one is still budget-friendly at $329), the ideal buyer won't mind manually emptying as long as navigation is seamless.\nWhy we picked this\nThe standalone version of the base-tier Shark Matrix goes further than most robot vacuums in the under-$200-on-sale price range. Like the similarly-priced Eufy L60, the Shark Matrix RV2300 packs essential features like LiDAR-guided smart mapping used to send the robovac to specific spots or rooms, which I really do find to be a crucial feature even if you're only dealing with a few rooms. (Smart mapping is such a normalized feature nowadays that it's harder to find a vac without it than with it, anyway.)\nCompared to, say, the cheapest-of-cheap Roombas in the sub-$200 price range, the Shark RV2300 goes further with Matrix cleaning: a back-and-forth crosshatch technique that gives the vacuum more opportunities to grab debris it may have missed on the first pass. This seriously upped the reliability of this vacuum in my eyes \u2014 and even though it wasn't the suction needed to dig cat hair out of my living room or bedroom rugs, it was more than enough to keep visible food crumbs out of the kitchen and kitty litter off the bathroom floor on a daily basis.\nDetails\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nOther robot vacuums I've tested\nI have tested several other compact robot vacuums in the past that didn't make the most recent cut for this list. These include older models like the Eufy L60, Roomba 694, and the Roomba Combo Essential 2, which have simply been overshadowed by other (often newer) vacuums that offer more suction power and smarter features in the same budget price range.\nOne comparison that sticks out is the Roomba 205 DustCompactor versus the 3i G10+, which both \"self-empty\" without a self-emptying dock. However, I wasn't psyched on my experience with the Roomba 205 \u2014 it got stuck on rug corners and got lost too often. Plus, the 3i G10+ offers more advanced features like small obstacle and pet waste avoidance and a livestream pet camera, whereas the Roomba 205 doesn't.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe slimmest robot vacuums in 2025 include the Eufy C10 at 2.85 inches, and for a much more powerful option, the Roborock Saros 10R at 3.1 inches. In general, the average height of a robot vacuum with a decent dust bin and brush roll system is between three and 3.5 inches. (Robot vacuums with a water tank and mopping pads will be taller.)\nEven if you don't pick one that short, almost every option on the market sits well below four inches. Be sure to measure the clearance under your lowest-hanging furniture, like the couch or the bed, to assure that your robovac can scoot under the entire way under.\nNo, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav isn't worth the cost, and would be particularly frustrating in a crowded living situation. Dyson claims that its first robot vacuum in almost a decade has twice the suction power of any robot vacuum on the market. While vacuuming was decent in testing done at senior shopping reporter Leah Stodart's home, she wasn't as blown away by the results as she expected \u2014 and was full-on disappointed by the 360 Vis Nav's edge cleaning, despite Dyson asserting that the 360 Vis Nav uses a special side duct to reach into corners and along walls better than competitors.The 360 Vis Nav's build isn't slim or chic, either \u2014 and with such a loud color scheme and chunky design, it wouldn't exactly blend in in a small space.\nAnd without a self-emptying dock, mopping capabilities, or small obstacle sensors that detect cords or pet waste (an absolute must in this price range), the Dyson 360 Vis Nav isn't worth $1,199.99. There are more reliable options that have a much more robust list of features, whether you're down to spend over a grand or not.\nNo, battery life doesn't matter a ton here \u2014 less square feet to cover in one cleaning session means battery life isn't the determining factor that it is when buying a botvac for a big house. But think of it this way: While minutes of runtime on one charge may not matter here, good battery life in a small house would allow your robot vacuum to deploy max suction power on its whole route instead of sacrificing power to conserve battery. This way, you're not deciding between sacrificing cleaning speed or cleaning performance.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "I've tested 25+ robot vacuums. Here are 6 I'd actually recommend buying in 2025.\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nThere's definitely something to be said for the crisp handheld control of a powerful cordless Dyson. But if you're not one to classify cleaning as cathartic, why not outsource that tedious task? The best robot vacuums patrol your home to clear away dust, crumbs, pet hair, and sometimes even spills or stains on hard floors \u2014 no elbow grease required.\nAnd after testing 25+ robot vacuums on my own personal floors (my apartment is very clean), I can confidently call out the top robotic vacuum cleaners that'll make your life easier.\nAre Roombas the best robot vacuums?\nThough some Roombas are really good robot vacuums, they're far from the only good robot vacuums.\niRobot dominated the robot vacuum realm from the early 2000s up until a few years ago, so it's no surprise that much of the general public forgets that \"Roomba\" isn't simply a generic term for any robotic vacuum.\nBut Roombas aren't in a league of their own anymore. I mean, you can't even Google \"Roomba\" without a question comparing Roombas to Shark robot vacuums popping up. I'm also here to put some respect on names like Roborock and Eufy \u2014 they're continuously releasing new contenders that are often a better value than Roombas in the same price range.\nI'm regularly testing the top robot vacuums at multiple price points and comparing them to top performers from previous years, with all my evaluations taking place in my own home on various rugs, tile, and hardwood floors. As I test each robot vacuum, I keep notes on their overall suction power, scrubbing efficacy (if it's a robot vacuum that mops), pet hair pickup, self-emptying docks and self-washing mopping pads, smart mapping and navigation, obstacle avoidance, and the overall user experience. All of that is considered through the lens of cost efficiency. I'll be the first one to point out when a budget vacuum cleaner is solid for the price, or when a premium robot vacuum is actually worth the splurge \u2014 or not worth the splurge, in the case of Roborock's $2,599.99 robot vacuum with an arm.\nThroughout my continuous testing, I've narrowed down your shopping list to six options. Here is the best robot vacuum for every home and budget in 2025.\nAs a senior shopping reporter, I have been testing popular robot vacuums for Mashable in the various apartments I've lived in since 2019 \u2014 most recently, a three-bedroom apartment where three people and two cats reside. I tested a dozen top robot vacuums in 2024, went hands-on with CES 2025 releases at home, and am in the process of reviewing the latest Roombas.\nOver the course of at least four weeks, each robot vacuum is put through a series of standardized tests that I\u2019ve laid out to exemplify all factors of trusting a robot vacuum in your home on a daily basis. Those tests cover four main pillars of robot vacuum competence:\nCleaning thoroughness: To encapsulate the full spectrum of messes a robot vacuum might encounter, each one is sent out to tackle various spills, debris, levels of pet hair, and more on multiple floor types. The vacs that mop perform extra tests on stains and spills.\nNavigation: A robot vacuum\u2019s ability to get to the right spot in the first place is arguably as important as the cleaning itself. I keep tabs on navigational accuracy when it comes to smart mapping my home, finding specific rooms and zones, and identifying small obstacles.\nUser-friendliness and politeness as a house guest: The ideal robot vacuum will be a relatively seamless addition to your household. Because if it\u2019s loud, an eyesore, or generally a pain to use, you're not going to want it in your house at all.\nMaintenance: Anyone aiming to avoid manual sweeping may also want to avoid manual upkeep of a vacuum. Many robot vacuums automate their own dust bin emptying, mopping pad washing, and more \u2014 the more self-sufficient they are, the better.\nFinally, I can't not consider the overall bang for your buck for each robot vacuum. Are its features on paper and actual cleaning competence worth the price tag, and how practical is that cost for the average household?\nRoborock Saros 10R\nBest robot vacuum right now\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Barely three inches tall\n- Dual spinning mopping pads scrub corners and edges closely\n- Relatively quiet when cleaning, self-emptying, and mop washing\n- Brush rolls really are anti-tangle, for once\n- Barely ever gets lost\n- Auto-dispenses detergent\n- Livestream pet camera is actually pretty useful\n- Phone charger avoidance still isn't perfect\n- Pet hair pickup on low-pile carpet could be better\n- Dock's slightly curved top is annoying\n- Takes forever to mop\n- I wish it came in white like the Saros 10\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Roborock Saros 10R.\nWho it's for\nThe new Roborock Saros 10R is a worthwhile investment for people who are picky about their floors and are willing to pay for the most reliable, hands-off cleaning experience. With the Saros 10R, you get literal wall-to-wall cleaning (edges and corners included), true barefoot-ready sanitation on floors, and a full self-cleaning dock that deals with dust, mopping pads, and dirty water on its own.\nThe Saros 10R would particularly flourish in lived-in homes with complex furniture, complex hardwood-to-rug layouts, or heavy foot traffic or paw traffic. If your home is fully carpeted aside from the kitchen and a bathroom, it's probably overkill.\nWhy we picked this\nYou probably wouldn't initially peg one of the thinnest robot vacuums on the market as one of the most powerful. But Roborock somehow squeezed an incredible amount of power under the slim hood of the Saros 10R, and it ended up being the most well-rounded robot vacuum that I've ever tested.\nIts 20,000 Pa of suction power nears the strongest you can get in 2025, and doubles the 10,000 Pa that the Roborock Qrevo Master, my top pick from 2024, had. While it didn't fully ace pulling pet hair off of every pile of rug in my home, it still overall had a great track record with debris from protein powder, to kitty litter, to long human hairs, to whole goldfish crackers. Even on Max mode, it's not very loud, either.\nBut the Saros 10R really shone during mopping. I firmly back the dual spinning mopping pad setup like this one over the single flat pad design \u2014 I always feel like the double movement provides more opportunity to fully wipe up spills and scrub at stains. One of those mops is hinged and can swing out a few inches past the vac's circular body, allowing the Saros 10R to get more detailed along wall edges and in corners than most hybrid robovacs can. Imagine the satisfaction of watching the Saros 10R squeeze into a low-clearance sticky spot, like under the fridge, and then diligently mop that crevice. This flexible mopping pad design is also the main reason why I'd recommend the Saros 10R over the Saros 10, whose singular mopping pad was more likely to smear spills in my testing.\nFinishing touches include small obstacle avoidance that was about 85 percent reliable around cords, laundry, and shoes in my home, as well as a livestream pet camera that I actually used a lot when I wasn't home.\nDetails\nEufy E20 3-in-1\nBest if you also want a stick vacuum\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $400\n- Shockingly affordable for a robot and stick vacuum combo\n- Suction power of both vacuums is powerful for the price\n- 75 day self-empty dust capacity\n- Room by room smart mapping is quite accurate\n- Dock is very compact\n- Doesn't mop\n- A bit loud\n- Exposed motor isn't the most aesthetically appealing design\nWho it's for\nThe percentage of homes that would benefit from having both a robot vacuum and a manual stick vacuum is probably 100 percent. In a perfect world, right? If you don't have the space, budget, or patience for that, the Eufy E20 3-in-1 is a really strategic way to maximize a mid-range budget. The E20 would have serious daily usability if your idea of a clean home goes past the floors to crevices like windowsills, car seats, staircases, or the pit of despair between couch cushions.\nWhy we like it\nIn a sea of $1,500+ vacuums, Eufy was genius to take the \"bang for your buck\" approach with its CES 2025 contender. At $649.99, the Eufy E20 3-in-1 isn't all that steep for a self-emptying, smart mapping robot vacuum, let alone the bonus cordless vacuum it brings along. Here, 3-in-1 refers to the robot vacuum, cordless stick vacuum, and handheld modes. Switching between these modes just involves pulling the motor out of the robot vacuum body and clicking it onto one of the included attachments.\nThe Eufy E20 definitely isn't the most powerful robot vacuum I've tested, nor is it as powerful as my favorite Dyson vacuum, which I should note has an identical price tag. We already know that its real power lies in its range, but for the value, its robotic and handheld cleaning capabilities would actually suffice for any casual cleaner. At 8,000 Pa, it vacuums with the same amount of suction power as last year's Eufy X10 Pro Omni, which also impressed me during testing. Its pickup rate of fine debris along edges and long hairs on rugs could be better, but the E20 reliably took care of all visible crumbs and loose tufts of pet hair on most rugs, hardwood, and tile.\nWhile the Eufy E20 can avoid items like toys over 15 millimeters or pet food bowls, its obstacle avoidance doesn't extend to flatter items like cords or socks. Its navigation to specific rooms and zones, however, was nearly perfect in my apartment. It surveyed the three bedrooms and bathrooms extremely accurately on the first try, and after I added an extra border or two, the E20 reliably made its way to selected spots on a daily basis \u2014 and without getting stuck on a bath mat or under a bed.\nDetails\n3i G10+\nBest budget robot vacuum\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Occasionally on sale for under $400\n- 18,000 Pa suction power is wicked at any price point\n- Deals with dust for 60+ days without an auto-empty dock\n- Reliable small obstacle avoidance\n- Live stream pet camera is so rare at this price\n- Smart mapping is incredibly accurate and detailed\n- Can be stored under furniture\n- Physical design isn't exactly chic\n- Mopping is pretty basic\nOur review\nRead my review of the 3i G10+.\nWho it's for\nIf you're set on spending less than $500 on a robot vacuum, there are few reasons to not go with the 3i G10+. Between its ability to get around in small, cluttered spaces and its dust-compacting, space-saving design, the 3i G10+ would particularly be a great pick for apartments.\nThis niche, inexpensive pick also eclipses any other robot vacuum under $500 in the pet hair department \u2014 and even has stronger suction power than many premium robot vacuums. While it'd be a great pick for homes with a lot of carpeting or rugs, it can be ruled out for large homes with lots of hard floors and heavy-duty mopping needs.\nWhy we picked this\nThis is the first robot vacuum I've ever tested from 3i, and I already know it's going to be one of my most recommended robot vacuums of the year. While its dust-compacting element is cool because it saves you the space a self-empty dock would take up, it's hardly the G10+'s only monumental feature.\nFor such an inexpensive robot vacuum I was thoroughly impressed by the G10+'s perceptive navigation around my apartment. Its initial mapping run of the rooms was almost 100% accurate \u2014it even recognized beds, credenzas, and toilets all on its own, and automatically remembered where all of the rugs were. The 3i G10+ is also the incredibly rare budget option with small obstacle avoidance that can steer clear of cords or socks, plus pet waste (I tested this with fake brown sugar). But small obstacle avoidance isn't the only high-end feature 3i squeezed in here here \u2014 there's also a livestream pet camera. That was firmly a $1,000+ robot vacuum feature until now.\nAll of that brainpower isn't just fluff, either. The G10+ is a beast at cleaning. Its 18,000 Pa of suction power is super high for this price range, and you can tell that the G10+ is working hard as it moves extra meticulously when carpet is sensed, or during zone cleaning.\nDetails\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nBest budget self-washing and drying mopping pads\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $700\n- 8,000 Pa suction power wows in this price range\n- Affordable AI obstacle avoidance\n- Automatic water refill and mop pad washing/drying\n- Loud automatic emptying\n- Mistakes small rugs for obstacles\n- Still only has a single roller brush\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Eufy X10 Pro Omni.\nWho it's for\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is a stellar find for shoppers who can spend more than a few hundred bucks but who still draw the line at $1,000. With small obstacle avoidance and a self-washing and drying mopping system, this Eufy offers more bang for your buck than the similarly priced Roomba Combo j7+ or Roborock Q8 Max+. This particular Eufy robovac also has some of the best battery life on the market (even on its highest suction setting), making it an even easier choice for homes with lots of square footage or multiple stories.\nOf all the X10 Pro Omni's advanced features, the small obstacle avoidance can't be understated, especially in homes that are, let's say, well lived in. If you could bet money that there's a rogue sock, kid or pet toy, or phone charger on the ground at any given moment (it's the mountain of crap shoved under my bed for me), you'll appreciate the AI-powered small obstacle avoidance, which lets you confidently run the robot vac when you're not home to tidy up first.\nWhy we picked this\nEufy's most elaborate robot vacuum (it's the brand's first self-emptying hybrid that self-refills the water tank and self-washes and dries the mopping pads) was also somehow the most affordable robot vacuum that debuted at CES 2024. That plus small obstacle avoidance are features we usually see in only the priciest vacs in the competition, so the fact that the X10 Pro Omni's resum\u00e9 has both is seriously impressive.\nProps to Eufy for not skimping on wet or dry floor cleaning here. Its official suction power ranking of 8,000 Pa is beastly on paper and proved proficient IRL on messes like spilled dry rice on both medium and flat piles. For wet or sticky messes, it's a rare sub-$800 model with dual spinning mopping pads to actually scrub more than gloss.\nDetails\nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1\nBest budget robot mop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $400\n- Matrix Mode crosshatch pattern is great for spot cleaning\n- Sonic scrubbing is pretty advanced for a budget vacuum\n- Mops with cleaning solution, which is included\n- Very quick LiDAR mapping\n- Can mop with water or included cleaning solution\n- Pretty quiet when cleaning\n- Can't vacuum and mop at the same time\n- Requires rug verification run to avoid mopping rugs\n- Sometimes takes forever to find dock\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 (previously called the Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1).\nWho it's for\nToo many robot vacuums make impromptu spot cleaning much harder than it needs to be. If that's a pain point on your radar, you'll appreciate the straightforward approach of Shark's Matrix line. In particular, the model that mops is one of the best for quick tackling of spills or daily upkeep of a certain high-traffic spot, like near a door, with no clicking around in the app required past simply dragging a box to the desired area. Groundbreaking.\nWhile the Shark Matrix 2-in-1 would be fine in fully carpeted rooms, it's probably best for homes without a heavy rug situation, as the bot requires you to manually point out rugs or carpets in the app and can't vacuum while the water tank is attached.\nWhy we picked this\nNo tea, no shade: Shark wasn't a huge threat in the robot vacuum market until it strapped all of its affordable robot vacuums with Matrix cleaning mode. The wet and dry cleaning of the Shark Matrix Plus is the best way to experience it without paying for Shark's absolute fanciest robot vacuum. Though the cleaning obviously wasn't as deep as the more premium Shark PowerDetect that came out more than a year later, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 always did a sufficient job at light daily upkeep of kitty litter and long hairs on my bathroom floor and crushed crumbs on my low pile living room rug. In fact, I found myself reaching for this Shark over the similarly-priced Roombas that I was testing at the same time \u2014 they were missing debris way more often.\nLike the other Matrix model mentioned above, this Shark Matrix Plus embodies the \"and one for good measure\" approach by cleaning the targeted area from multiple angles. Unlike the other Matrix model mentioned above, this one also mops. In Matrix mode, the pad vibrates 100 times per minute to scrub at droplets that more basic 2-in-1 robot vacuums with stationary clothes kind of just gloss over.\nDetails\nRoomba 105 + AutoEmpty Dock\nBest Roomba value\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $300\n- Better suction power than the Roomba i5 or Roomba 694\n- LiDAR mapping correctly identifies specific rooms\n- Four versions mix and match mopping and automatic emptying\n- Doesn't always smoothly get over rugs\n- No small obstacle avoidance technology\n- Not enough suction power for shedding from multiple pets\nWho it's for\nIf you absolutely must have the iRobot name under your roof, the Roomba 105 series vacuums are iRobot's most advanced and fairly-priced entry-level robot vacuums to date. They'd be ideal for the crowd who is totally fine with settling for a not-amazing-but-decent clean if it affordably lightens their chore load. It'd be a fine addition to an apartment or small space with low foot traffic and relatively simple layouts.\nIt's also nice that you can customize your choice to the features you need in your house \u2014 and how much you want to spend. There are four versions of the Roomba 105: a standalone mopping and non-mopping version, and a self-emptying mopping and non-mopping version. They all have huge discounts quite often, dropping both standalone models below $200 and both self-emptying models below $300.\nWhy we picked this\nTo be real, any random Roomba you could pick out is probably being upstaged by a different brand's robot vacuum with the same price tag. But if you insist on trying a Roomba, the 2025 Roomba 105 series vacuums definitely offer better bang for your buck over any of the low-budget Roombas.\nThe most impactful upgrade from the i5 to the 105 lies in suction power: The Roomba 105 offers 60 times the suction of 600 series Roombas like the Roomba 694 or Roomba 675, while the Roomba i5 offers just 10 times the power of the 600 series. This translates to 7,000 Pa in suction power for the 105 (a metric that iRobot hadn't used until this 2025 round of Roombas.) On my apartment's hard floors, the 105 had a commendable track record for the price \u2014 it sucked up most tracked kitty litter and spilled protein powder, and grabbed all but one or two heavy pieces of dry cat food. On rugs, most loose crumbs and visible fuzzies were taken care of, though matted down cat fur required a second pass from a stick vacuum.\niRobot also finally shifted to LiDAR-based smart mapping with its 2025 Roombas, which ultimately just means faster, more precise room mapping. The Roomba 105 successfully made it to the selected rooms and zones in my apartment 95 percent of the time, despite the new Roomba Home app being significantly more basic than the old one.\nDetails\nTopics Robot Vacuums Vacuums\nOther robot vacuums I've tested recently\nI tested several other top robot vacuums in the past that didn't make the most recent cut for this list. Some, like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra, Roborock Qrevo Master, Narwal Freo X Ultra, and various versions of the Roomba j7 were my top recommendations at one point, but have since been overshadowed by newer, more powerful models that are a better bang for your buck.\nI've also tested some 2025 robot vacuum releases that were OK, but ultimately aren't a top pick for me. The Dreame X50 Ultra grabbed attention during its CES 2025 debut for its ability to \"climb,\" though the fine print is that it can't scale thresholds taller than 6 millimeters (about 2.36 inches). The Roborock Saros 10 and 10R were able to hoist over the few thick doorway thresholds in my apartment just as well as the X50 Ultra. Its mopping and vacuuming capabilities are better than most mid-range robot vacuums, of course, but they weren't impressive enough for me to suggest the X50 Ultra in this list over either Saros 10 model.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nI say yes, but whether robot vacuums are worth it or not comes with a caveat: It can't be just any robot vacuum. A cheap robot vacuum that acts drunk \u2014 scattering crumbs rather than sucking them up, bumping into walls, getting stuck on area rugs \u2014 is completely missing that convenience factor that draws people to automated cleaning in the first place.\nThe robot vacuum market is crowded. Consider the following nitty-gritty criteria to help narrow your options:\nSmart mapping: This is a non-negotiable at this point, considering robot vacuums with smart mapping can be scored for under $200 if you find them on sale. Often LiDAR (laser) based, smart mapping refers to the navigational tech that allows a robot vacuum to create and remember your home's layout. This is how it can clean specific rooms on demand, or spot clean a certain zone within a room that you've selected in the mobile app. Small obstacle avoidance is a slightly pricier, but seriously worthwhile extension of navigational technology. It helps the robot vacuum detect and avoid items on the floor that other robot vacs would get stuck on, like phone chargers or shoes. For a robot vacuum to be worthwhile, it needs to get to the right place \u2014 just saying.\nSuction power: A vacuum is the one purchase that you hope sucks a lot. Suction power is typically measured in Pascals (Pa), averaging between 5,000 to 8,000 Pa for any decent contender since around 2022. The ante is being upped, though: Multiple 2024 flagship models clocked between 10,000 Pa and 12,000 Pa, and several 2025 flagships are casually hitting between 20,000 Pa and 22,000 Pa. Stronger suction will be needed to pick up heavier pieces of debris like pellet cat litter or popcorn (be sure to set a barrier around Lego pieces) and to yank patted-down pet hair from carpet or rug fibers.\nFloor type: Expanding on the point above, carpeting and rugs require stronger suction than hard floors, as well as an extra-wide or self-cleaning brush roll to prevent hair from wrapping. Folks in homes with multiple floor types might consider a bigger, sturdier robovac with large wheels and floor type sensors that can hoist itself over door mats, rugs of varying piles, and transitions from carpet to hard floors.\nAutomatic emptying: Because robot vacuums are typically under four inches tall, their onboard dust bins are also small \u2014 which means they frequently require emptying. (Dust bins fill up particularly quickly in homes with pets.) A self-emptying vacuum takes that job out of your hands, emptying itself into a larger dust bin in its charging dock. These larger bins can typically hold weeks of dirt without needing to be cleaned or dumped out.\nSelf-washing and drying mopping pads: If you're sending your robot vacuum mop combo out to mop almost every day, your life will be much easier if the robot vac's self-empty dock also deals with the dirty mopping pads, too. After mopping, the vac will wash and dry its pads and dispense new, clean water into the tank, so they're ready to go any time you need to start a new cleaning. The dock will also hold the dirty water for up to a week at a time.\nHome layout: Every robot vacuum is equipped with sensors and drop detection. But if your home has lots of rooms, lots of turns, or lots of close-together furniture, you'll have far fewer navigation issues with a model that uses LiDAR laser technology or vSLAM camera technology to map exactly how your home is laid out, including labeling of specific rooms, mental notes of furniture and twists and turns, and the ability to follow zones set by you in the app. In 2024, smart mapping is so common and so affordable that you'd actually be more hard-pressed to find a robot vacuum that doesn't have this capability \u2014 and if you happen to stumble across one, there's definitely a better option for your money.\nApp control: Any robot vacuum that we'll recommend at this point is WiFi-enabled, which means it will be synced with a smartphone app to control scheduling and remote start, map and virtual boundary editing, and suction or mopping levels, as well as occasional more advanced features. WiFi compatibility also typically brings voice control via Alexa or Google integration.\nBattery life and square footage: One of the main complaints people have about their robot vacuum is that it craps out in the middle of the floor. Larger spaces or homes with multiple stories obviously require more time to clean, and how much you prioritize battery life depends on how annoyed you'll be if your robot vac has to take a time out during its queue to charge. Average run times for the list below range between 90 and 150 minutes, which translates to about 500 and 2,600 square feet covered on one charge. Some ultra-efficient models can clock over 200 minutes on one charge, which would only really matter in homes exceeding 3,000 square feet.\nHeight and low-profile furniture: No one should have to be scared about what's accumulated under their couch over the past year. A robot vacuum measuring three inches or less in height should be able to scoot under most low-hanging couches and beds. Robot vacuums with mopping gear and a water tank on board are slightly bulkier, but many manage to stay below 3.5 inches.\nSadly, no, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav doesn't live up to the hype. Dyson claims that its first robot vacuum in almost a decade has twice the suction power of any robot vacuum on the market. While vacuuming was decent in testing done at senior shopping reporter Leah Stodart's home, she wasn't as blown away by the results as she expected \u2014 and was full-on disappointed by the 360 Vis Nav's edge cleaning, despite Dyson asserting that the 360 Vis Nav uses a special side duct to reach into corners and along walls better than competitors.\nAnd without a self-emptying dock, mopping capabilities, or small obstacle sensors that detect cords or pet waste (an absolute must in this price range), the Dyson 360 Vis Nav isn't worth $1,199.99. There are more reliable options that have a much more robust list of features, whether you're down to spend over a grand or not.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nThe robot vacuum with a grabby arm from Roborock's showing at CES 2025 has been hogging all of the attention, but that one wasn't the new Roborock vacuum that I wanted to test the most.\nThough I'll still get my hands on the Roborock Saros Z70 at some point, I was personally more interested in the Roborock Saros 10R: a way more practical robot vacuum from the 2025 fleet that still goes hard on premium upgrades.\nWhat's special about the Roborock Saros 10R?\nAs Roborock's thinnest robot vacuum ever, the Roborock Saros 10R may not seem like it has room for a big navigational tech upgrade \u2014 or Roborock's second-most powerful suction power yet. But somehow, both of those are packed into a body that's barely more than three inches tall.\nThe Saros 10R clocks 20,000 Pa of suction power, only to be beaten by its sibling, the Saros 10's 22,000 Pa. Still, 20,000 Pa is a level that very few other robot vacs in the market even come close to. To put it in perspective, that's double the whoosh of my favorite robot vacuum from 2024, the Roborock Qrevo Master.\nThe other main grab here applies to how perceptive the vac is as it's maneuvering around your home. Compared to the typical LiDAR system, the Saros 10R axes the circular laser tower atop most robot vacs you're probably picturing. Instead, the Saros 10R is able to have that thin, flat top design due to its implementation of StarSight 2.0 with 3D ToF (Time of Flight) technology. That's some fancy NASA-coded terminology for a more precise sense of location within your walls and more precise detection of small objects.\nRather than just relying on laser sensors as traditional LiDAR does, StarSight takes it a step further with 3D scanning of 21,600 sensor points around the room. With that, the Saros 10R can sniff out upwards of 108 different objects (that's up from the 73 objects that the first version of Starsight could detect). With the upgrade to the 2.0 version also comes Vertibeam Lateral Obstacle Avoidance to aid in delicately cleaning around irregular walls and furniture.\nNow, this isn't the first time we've seen StarSight 2.0 \u2014 the 2024 Roborock Qrevo Slim also uses it. But the Qrevo Slim's 11,000 Pa of suction power pales in comparison to the Saros 10R's 20,000 Pa. Another Saros model, the Saros Z70, also has StarSight 2.0 technology, but it's expected to cost around $2,000 when it finally comes out. So impressively, the Saros 10R is the only StarSight model that hits 20,000 Pa without hitting the $2,000 price point.\nAlso, a little commotion for the Saros 10R's chic dock, please.\nAfter years of testing robot vacuums that basically strictly exist in plasticky black or plasticky white designs, this dock's sleek mirrored face with rounded corners is a welcomed glow-up. (The fingerprints it easily attracts? Slightly less chic.) I still fully stand by my formal plea for robot vacuums to start coming in chrome gray to match stainless steel kitchen appliances, but I digress \u2014 the Roborock Saros 10R is a self-emptying dock you won't mind sitting out in your living room. At 19 inches tall x 15 inches wide x 12 inches deep, it's also on the compact side \u2014 it's smaller than Dreame X50 Ultra and Roborock Qrevo Master's docks.\nCleaning performance: Mopping and corner cleaning are the standouts\nI want to talk about the 20,000 Pa of suction power first. On paper, that's the strongest robot vacuum I've had under my roof to date \u2014 incredible news for a person with barefoot standards as high as mine.\nThe suction power bump was most palpable when simply taking care of everyday debris that keeps me up at night if not cleaned: crumbs and rogue pieces of shredded cheese near the kitchen counter, kibble near the cat food bowls, kitty litter spread in a two-foot radius around both litter boxes, and strands of long hair everywhere. I sent the Saros 10R to tidy all of this on a daily basis (occasionally twice a day) and was almost always welcomed back into a pretty spotless room. The cleaning was incredibly consistent on dry debris of various sizes and textures, and I wasn't constantly feeling like using the robot vacuum was just a Band-Aid until I had time to actually go in with my trusty Dyson V12 Detect Slim.\nSpeaking of my Dyson, I will use its green laser to prove a point about the Saros 10R's competency on kitty litter (or any other small, crunchy remnants that will probably pop up in most people's homes).\nCoverage on rugs was slightly more hit-or-miss than on hardwood or tile. The Saros 10R had about a 90 percent pickup rate on my medium-pile rugs, taking care of spilled chip crumbs and full Goldfish crackers, layers of shedding from my two cats, and long hair that I pulled directly out of my brush and threw on the floor (for science).\nUnfortunately, the pickup percentage dwindled a bit on lower pile rugs. My cats sunbathe on the one in my room on a daily basis, so it's usually covered in a layer of cat hair not super visible unless you look at the bottom of your socks. One surefire way I can see how well a robot vacuum is doing on pet hair is to use my Shark PowerDetect stick vacuum afterward. The key here is that that Shark self-empties its dustbin into a larger dock each time I hang it back up, which means it's always starting with a completely empty, clear dustbin \u2014 and that means I can quickly pinpoint just how much gunk is being sucked up during the cleaning session at hand.\nThat Shark's dustbin should just not be that full after a robot vacuum dished out 20,000 Pa of suction power across it. Granted, I will say that I also did the Shark test on that gray rug a few paragraphs up, and the Saros 10R had clearly done a much more thorough job there. Higher pile is typically the trickier length for robot vacuums to comb through, but oddly enough, it seems backwards for the Saros 10R \u2014 I'm not sure if that has something to do with the side-by-side brushrolls versus the typically parallel ones or what.\nThis edge cleaning absolutely eats\nI will say, though, that I'm not super mad about the mediocrity on low pile rugs because of how the Saros 10R aced one problem area that robot vacs always seem to struggle with: corner cleaning. Aside from heightened suction power all around, that level of detail in right angles and along edges can likely be attributed to both the flexible corner arms and upgraded StarSight that allows the bot to better assess walls, furniture, objects, and how close it can get to them.\nMore impressively, the close corner cleaning also applies to mopping. Robot mops that only have one large, mostly stationary singular pad just don't have much range of motion, whereas the side-by-side spinning mopping pads on the Saros 10R do. One swings on a hinge and extends out from under the robot vacuum to hit edges and 90-degree angles that a circular vacuum would fumble otherwise.\nThis is another crucial factor for the picky barefoot crowd who need to know a floor is actually being scrubbed from multiple angles. In my experience, the dual spinning design just provides more versatile physical agitation to thoroughly scrub at stains or wipe up stickiness \u2014 the big singular pad just feels like a glorified once-over with a washcloth.\nI had no complaints about the Saros 10R's mopping performance on thin consistences like wine and soy sauce spills. Thicker drops like ranch and marinara sauce did risk getting pushed around before the Saros 10R had a chance to return to the dock to wash the pads, but overall, remnants weren't really left behind. Syrup was a struggle \u2014 the area around the original syrup incident was slightly sticky and smelled like syrup before I cleaned it by hand. Two cleaning passes are probably necessary for thicker, peskier spills like that.\nAutomated mopping with actually good edge mopping has really come in handy for random droplets under the kitchen counter and for the upkeep of our front door situation. Usually, there are two stools plus a million pairs of shoes piled up under this island, and the whole area is just constantly covered in footprints, little rocks, hair, and other stuff like that. It's been nice to simply push everything out of the way, let the Saros 10R get all up in there, and then put everything back. It was particularly delicious to watch the Saros 10R successfully lap up the visible dust, crumbs, and hair that gather under that edge that a stick vacuum is too thick to reach.\nBut I think my favorite example of the Saros 10R's cleaning exhaustiveness comes when it has to vacuum and mop at the same time \u2014 for certain messes, that'll only go well if both parts are doing their job well. For instance, I decided to re-pot a snake plant (IDK what I did to kill it, don't come for me) in the middle of my living room. I made an absolute mess of moist potting soil on the hardwood, then sent the Saros 10R to vacuum and mop it at the same time. Just vacuuming would still leave a brown dusty film that isn't really the consistency to be sucked up, but just mopping would just turn that dirt into mud.\nI was seriously impressed at how spotless that area was after the Saros 10R came through. I did send it for two passes because I assumed it'd miss some pieces the first time. The second trip covered any lingering pieces on the outskirts of the zone, with the mopping pads coming through and eliminating that brown dusty film. A cheap Roomba trying to tackle a pile of dirt would literally just make the mess bigger.\nNavigation: Gets to the right spot without question\nThe few minutes that it took to unbox and set up the Saros 10R took longer than the Saros 10R did to complete its first mapping run of my apartment. That speediness didn't dog its accuracy \u2014 a majority of its room designations were correct, complete with notches already marked for large obstacles like turns in the wall or big pieces of furniture. All I had to do was drag some lines to split the very open-concept kitchen, living room, and entryway up. (The fact that the app has a room limit is weird, but OK.)\nDuring over a month of testing and use multiple times a day, the Saros 10R literally never got lost. I was almost always either doing a specific room or zone cleaning (rather than letting a full home cleaning rip), and I never had to give a second thought to whether it'd make it to the right spot, whether it'd actually cover the entire selected area, or whether it'd take extra long going on side missions that I didn't assign.\nThere wasn't really any getting stuck, either. The Saros 10R carefully weaved in and out of various table and chair legs, around cat food and water bowls, and under a bed with a chaotic storage situation underneath. My bathroom layout is a little tight, with a toilet, a litter box, and an egg-shaped hamper, and many robot vacuums give up instead of cleaning in between all of that stuff. The Saros 10R carved around all of them safely, even picking up most hairs and kitty litter by the wall.\nPast smart mapping, small obstacle avoidance is the other factor playing into a robot vacuum's navigation. It's definitely a crucial feature to have if there are cords or other random crap on the floor from time to time. While the Saros 10R's track record was good in my apartment, there were still some blips on small cat toys, one charger, and wiry string lights dangling on the floor. I don't expect perfection even from a top Roomba (my most trusted small obstacle avoidance tech), but I'm not sure that the whole StarSight upgrade is any more accurate than traditional LiDAR.\nUser-friendliness: A relatively quiet, pet-friendly addition to your home\nVolume during cleaning obviously varies based on the suction level, which gets up to 68 decibels on max. I was impressed by how unobtrusive the automatic emptying whoosh is \u2014 around 73 decibels, which is a similar level to the rumble of a washing machine. It's much more muffled than I'm used to and does not scare the shit out of me every time.\nIf you have pets, the Saros 10R's livestream pet camera is yet another feature that helps this vacuum blend in with your home life. Like some older flagship Roborocks, the camera tab in the app allows you to see whatever the robot sees as it's driving, including an option to \"search for the pet.\"\nIs it a completely necessary feature? Probably not. But if you're a pet parent and you say you wouldn't use this, you're lying. A ton of people have standalone security cameras to keep tabs on their pets when they're not home, so adding that pet sitter-like feature to an appliance that's already roving your house is actually pretty practical.\nMaintenance: Hands-off and competent, as expected\nAs expected from any top robot vacuum brand's premium models nowadays, the Saros 10R comes with a full self-cleaning dock that includes automatic dustbin emptying and automatic mopping pad washing and heated drying, as well as water tank refilling.\nI personally find the autonomous mopping pad maintenance system to be so worth it if you, well, actually want to use the mop on a regular basis. When testing mopping robot vacuums that don't have the auto wash and dry system, I found myself not using mopping mode simply because I didn't feel like dealing with washing a soggy mopping pad every day. The Saros 10R made that part super easy and, as with most self-cleaning docks, also maintained its mops during mopping by returning to rinse them mid-clean.\nOne tiny thing I've noticed is that it feels like the clean water tank is always empty or the dirty water tank is always full. The tanks are definitely smaller than others in self-cleaning docks that I've seen, probably to keep the dock compact. Granted, I do send the Saros 10R out to mop a lot \u2014 my large 22-foot x 10-foot hardwood kitchen gets mopped almost every day, and my tile bathroom and the apartment entryway get it about every other day. The red light to refill the clean water tank comes on once every few days. Though it's more often than most of the robot vacs I've tested in the past, it's not outlandish. Plus, the dirty water is pretty damn gross every time I dump it, and that's just proof that the vac's scrubbing thoroughly. And when a robot mop is so reliable that building it into a daily routine becomes a reflex, more frequent refilling just comes with the territory.\nWhen it comes to maintaining the brush roll, the Saros 10R doesn't really require regular upkeep of tangled hair. This is thanks to its side-by-side DuoDivide brush rolls that spin independently and pull hair toward the middle and up into the dustbin. After about two weeks of using the Saros 10R every day, I got my scissors out, expecting to need to cut some wrapped hairballs out of the bottom. To my surprise, next to no hair was wrapped around, marking the first robot vacuum I've ever tried that actually follows through on its \"anti-tangle\" claims.\nDownsides: A few quirks for being so expensive\nThe Roborock Saros 10R is one of the most expensive robot vacuums on the market in 2025. It is the norm for a brand's high-enders to near or topple the $1,500 price point, and the Saros 10R is quite advanced. Still, many people would probably laugh out loud at the thought of spending that much on a vacuum.\nBut FWIW, the $1,599.99 is actually quite modest when you consider that Roborock's most expensive flagship from 2024, the S8 MaxV Ultra, also debuted at $1,599.99. That vacuum only has 8,000 Pa of suction power (compared to 20,000) and obviously doesn't use the upgraded obstacle avoidance system that the Saros 10R does, yet debuted at the same price. So the Saros 10R gets credit there.\nHowever, the argument could be made that a robot vacuum this expensive should operate pretty much perfectly, and the Saros 10R doesn't. Firstly, though the whole StarSight thing was supposed to be a big selling point, I'm not sure if it's necessarily better than other small obstacle avoidance tech out there, like Roborock's Reactive AI or iRobot's camera-based PrecisionVision navigation. My Saros 10R did run over some cat toys and a white phone charger once (granted, it was kind of blending in with a rug with white swirls) and completely ate a wiry string of twinkle lights. Even the smartest botvacs are bound to slip up every once in a while, but still.\nThe clean water tank draining and the dirty water tank filling \"quickly\" can't even fully be classified as a downside, in my opinion, because I do think it's a testament to how often I'm opting to have this thing mop. For the price, I do think the Saros 10R should automatically dispense detergent into the clean water tank from inside the dock.\nIt's also possible that the water runs out so often because the Saros 10R takes forever to mop. Surely it's expending more water than necessary. It's not typically an issue unless I'm in a hurry for whatever reason, but sometimes, I'm like, \"PLEASE be done soon.\"\nOne other minor thing about the dock is that the auto-empty suction doesn't always \"work\" the whole way. I frequently see a dust bunny hanging out the back of the robot vacuum itself where it connects to the dock. That's not a huge deal.\nAnd while I don't expect every dock to be front accessible so that the top can be used like a side table (like the Roomba Combo Max 10), I do like when the water buckets are flat so that I can at least set decor on them that can be moved when the tanks need to be refilled.\nThe competition\nOverall, it just makes the most sense to simply pit the Saros 10R against other robot vacuums in the same price range. The main competitor is the Roborock Saros 10 (no R), named nearly identically for reasons unbeknownst to man. (Roborock did the same thing with the million Qrevo models from last year.) While the Saros 10 does squeeze out 2,000 Pa more suction power than the 10R, that's a negligible difference when you're already at 20,000. The mopping pad setup would be my main deciding factor, as I've witnessed more thorough results from a dual spinning pad design (like the 10R's) over the outdated, singular D-shaped pad (like the Saros 10's) that can't really scootch out from under the vacuum into corners. I'll keep you posted on whether the regular Saros 10's Reactive AI obstacle avoidance is any better or worse than the 10R's StarSight.\nFor a cheaper-but-still-top-notch Roborock pick, I still think the Qrevo Master would be excellent in most households. Though it has half the suction power as the Saros 10R, its 10,000 Pa still fared well in my apartment. It has the same spinning mopping pads, self-cleaning dock, and pet camera, and is frequently on sale for as low as $899.99.\nThe other Saros model dropped at CES 2025 was the Z70, but the difference between the Saros 10R and the Saros Z70 is easier to spot: one has an arm, and one doesn't. While it sounds cool upon first read, the Saros Z70's practicality dwindles quickly when you learn that it'll probably cost around $2,000 for cleaning capabilities not much more powerful than the 10R. The Saros 10R certainly isn't about to be running over little items any more than the Z10 is \u2014 it just won't be putting them in a nearby basket. In the words of my fellow Senior Shopping Reporter Haley Henschel, if you can afford a $2,000 robot vacuum with an arm, \"why not just hire a maid?\"\nIn terms of non-Roborock models, iRobot's best fighter would be the Roomba Combo 10 Max. It's the only Roomba that washes and dries its mopping pads and refills its own water tank, and could be a good bit more affordable than the Saros 10R if you can find it on sale for $899 or $999. While I'm slightly more confident in iRobot's obstacle avoidance, the Combo 10 Max kept missing debris along edges and in corners of my apartment. It also uses a singular flat mop pad that doesn't cover a lot of ground on one pass.\nThe Saros 10R's biggest competition from the class of CES 2025 is the $1,699.99 Dreame X50 Ultra, whose claim to fame is climbing \u2014 over small obstacles and thresholds, not up and down stairs. Like my take on the robotic arm thing, I personally don't care about these fancier physical methods of avoiding obstacles as long as nothing is being eaten. Despite matching 20,000 Pa suction power, the X50 Ultra I'm testing has left some rolled-up hairballs and fuzzies on more of my rugs than the 10R has. It also has a plasticky build and a not-so-compact dock.\nIs the Roborock Saros 10R worth it?\nWhen it costs $1,600, a botvac like the Roborock Saros 10R should be completing damn near every single task flawlessly. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that it does.\nBut I still think the Saros 10R is a wickedly well-rounded robot vacuum that would be a totally satisfactory upgrade in a lot of homes, especially ones with a lot of hard floors. Its suction power and mopping work together in tandem to achieve results more reliable than what I've ever experienced, even if its work on low pile rugs hasn't been as exceptional as I'd expect for a premium vac. If you've been frustrated specifically with corner cleaning, scrubbing, or low-clearance furniture with other vacuums, I'd say the Saros 10R will piss you off way less.\nBut would I wait for the verdict on the other blockbuster CES 2025 robot vacuums, or the verdict on one of the fancier Roombas that were just announced. If you still decide to go for the Saros 10R, that'll at least give you time to wait for a sale.\nTopics Robot Vacuums"

      "text": "The 3 best Shark robot vacuums beat Roomba competitors\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nIn an unspoken sort of way, Roomba has been crowned \"the best\" robot vacuum simply because it's the most established brand in the market. But Shark has always had competitive street cred when it comes to vacuums, and its newest rounds of robot vacuums finally make Shark a force to be reckoned with among Roombas and Roborocks.\nHaving personally tested the top robot vacuums from Shark and Roomba and botvacs from the other big robot vacuum brands, I've become quite familiar with Shark robot vacuums' advantages and disadvantages.\nShark really shines at spot cleaning, but has one major blind spot\nSometimes, there's an unexpected mess that you want to clean without messing around with a map on the app. In those cases, Shark Matrix robot vacuums make spot cleaning much easier than Roombas do. Setting a zone for a one-time clean in the Shark app is as easy as dragging a square in the designated spot cleaning tab, compared to having to create and name an official cleaning zone in the iRobot app. Most modern Shark robot vacuums also have a physical cleaning button if you want to pick the robot up and place it in the right area \u2014 an underrated feature that modern Roombas completely skip.\nOn the other hand, Shark's one big blind spot \u2014 literally \u2014 is small obstacle avoidance technology. While Roombas at several price points can steer clear of phone chargers, cords, socks, and pet waste, Shark hasn't mastered this coveted skill yet.\nBased on home testing through my personal standardized obstacle course, here are the three best Shark robot vacuums you can buy in 2025:\nAs a senior shopping reporter, I have been testing popular robot vacuums for Mashable in the various apartments I've lived in since 2019 \u2014 most recently, a three-bedroom apartment where three people and two cats reside.\nOver the course of at least four weeks, each robot vacuum is put through a series of standardized tests. Those tests cover four main pillars of robot vacuum competence:\nCleaning thoroughness: Cleaning thoroughness: To encapsulate the full spectrum of messes a robot vacuum might encounter, each one is sent out to tackle various spills, debris, levels of pet hair, and more on multiple floor types. The vacs that mop perform extra tests on stains and spills.\nNavigation: A robot vacuum\u2019s ability to get to the right spot in the first place is arguably as important as the cleaning itself. I keep tabs on navigational accuracy when it comes to smart mapping my home, finding specific rooms and zones, and identifying small obstacles.\nUser-friendliness and politeness as a house guest: The ideal robot vacuum will be a relatively seamless addition to your household. Because if it\u2019s loud, an eyesore, or generally a pain to use, you're not going to want it in your house at all.\nMaintenance: Anyone aiming to avoid manual sweeping may also want to avoid manual upkeep of a vacuum. Many robot vacuums automate their own dust bin emptying, mopping pad washing, and more \u2014 the more self-sufficient they are, the better.\nFinally, I have to consider the overall bang for your buck for each robot vacuum. Are its features on paper and actual cleaning performance worth the price tag, and how practical is that cost for the average household?\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro\nBest overall\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Goes on sale for under $700 throughout the year\n- Large wheels help it to navigate over rugs\n- The mopping pads lift high over carpet to keep them dry\n- Drag and drop spot cleaning process is painless and accurate\n- Very reliable suction on hard floors and varying rug piles\n- Comes with bottle of hard floor cleaner\n- Still runs over cords, which shouldn't happen at this price point\n- Dock and vacuum announce everything they're doing out loud\n- Floor almost gets too wet during mopping\nWho it's for\nThe most expensive Shark robot vacuum would best appease the crowd that expects the full hands-off robot vacuum experience \u2014 not just as in automation of the cleaning itself, but in automation of dustbin and mopping pad maintenance. As the only Shark that can wash and dry its own mopping pad and refill its own water tank, the PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro would be really handy in larger homes that have a significant amount of hard floors that would probably require a fresh mopping pad on a daily basis.\nWhy we picked this\nA self-washing and drying mopping pad situation is the current gold standard for hybrid robot vacuums, and Shark offering a premium model that hands-off solves my biggest gripe with Shark's previous fanciest hybrid, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1. While I enjoyed the Matrix Plus 2-in-1's thoroughness in taking double passes when vacuuming or scrubbing, the manual intervention the mopping pad and water tank required was so frequent that it made me want to skip mopping altogether. Now, the PowerDetect refills its own water tank from a larger tank in its dock and clicks its pad on and off by itself according to its upcoming task, so it's always on call to do either. I also appreciate how Shark rigged the PowerDetect with large wheels that fully hoist the vac over carpet to keep it dry during mopping mode. It does this by itself, too \u2014 no need to designate carpeted areas by hand in the map.\nSpeaking of those wheels, these hydraulics did not come to play. With their help, the PowerDetect has been one of the only (if not the only) robot vacuums to actually be able to get up and over a fluffy rug or bath mat and vacuum them without leaving them looking like a small tornado went through the room. Shark calls it \"NeverStuck\" technology, and so far, that's been accurate. Corner cleaning has been just as surprising, considering many premium bots I've tested can't seem to nail that \u2014 the PowerDetect reliably scoops up kitty litter lodged against the wall and crumbs lodged under the cabinets. Throw Shark's iconic \"no bullshit\" spot cleaning in the mix, and this self-cleaning self-care suite is so reliable otherwise that I don't even care that it hasn't mastered the art of dodging phone chargers.\nOther versions of the PowerDetect NeverTouch\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch (self-refilling but no self-washing or drying mopping pad): $899.99 or as low as $549.99 on sale\nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro AV2800ZE (extra floor sensor): $1,199.99 or as low as $699.99 on sale\nDetails\nShark Matrix RV2320S\nBudget pick\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale between $250 and $330\n- Accurate smart mapping\n- Reliable spot cleaning is crucial in any home size\n- Very compact self-empty dock\n- Matrix Cleaning goes over extra soiled spots from multiple angles\n- Decent edge cleaning for the price\n- Loud and rickety when cleaning\n- No live tracking of vacuum's cleaning path in app\n- No small object avoidance\n- Suction isn't strong enough for multi-pet household\nWho it's for\nThis Shark Matrix model is ideal for budget shoppers with low-intensity cleaning needs \u2014 Best Buy almost always has this Shark Matrix on sale for between $249.99 and $329.99. It'd be a great contender for a first time robot vacuum purchase, or an elevated entry-level upgrade from a ditsy outdated robot vacuum.\nThis charging base is one of the more compact self-emptying docks out there. The whole setup takes up less than two square feet of floor space and would work well in a tight apartment.\nWhy we picked this\nThe entry-level Matrix line is the go-to solid cheap Shark option now that the older Shark ION vacuums are basically obsolete. Shark Matrix models use LiDAR-based smart mapping to clean specific rooms or zones that you select in the app. During my testing, the Matrix RV2320S made it to the correct room or zone without fail. Surprisingly, navigation wasn't hindered by the bare bones map in the borderline clunky SharkClean app, which is far less detailed than other robot vacuum apps I've used.\nAs for actual cleaning performance, this Shark Matrix cleans circles around any cheap Roomba I've tried. When in Matrix Mode, the Shark will automatically vacuum from multiple angles in attempts to grab any debris missed on the first pass. (This is the default mode for spot cleaning, but can be set to use for entire rooms.) For the price, pet hair pickup was pretty thorough on low-pile and a fluffy area rug in my home, and scattered crumbs or pieces of kitty litter were rarely left behind. The RV2320S cleaned edges more closely than most basic bots do \u2014 though it's so hellbent on getting to the wall that it completely bulldozed my cats' food and water bowls a few times.\nThe Matrix RV2320S is also one of the most affordable Matrix models to come with a self-empty base.\nDetails\nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1\nBest budget robot mop\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Goes on sale for $349.99 for events like Black Friday\n- Affordable for a LiDAR-equipped hybrid with advanced mopping\n- Sonic scrubbing vibrates 1,000 times per minute\n- Matrix Cleaning goes over extra soiled spots from multiple angles\n- Includes a bottle of Shark's cleaning solution\n- Requires manual rug verification run to avoid mopping rugs\n- LiDAR still makes odd navigational choices\n- Only available with self-emptying\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1.\nWho it's for\nThe Matrix Plus 2-in-1 is one of two main Shark contenders for anyone who wants a robot vacuum that can mop. Price is the obvious factor that might make you opt for this one over my favorite Shark hybrid, the new PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro \u2014 the self-emptying version of the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 can almost always be found on sale while the PowerDetect rarely drops below $899.99 (if you can find it on sale at all).\nYour expected level of automation of your Shark's mopping pad will also play a huge role in choosing between these Sharks. If your home is mostly carpeted with only a few rooms that would need to be mopped, like a bathroom and kitchen-only type of situation, you may not mind having to physically attach the mopping pad or fill the water tank to enable mopping mode. The price difference may also be stark enough to convince you that having to manually wash the mopping pad after each run isn't that bad. Alternatively, the pricey PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro washes and dries its own mopping pad and refills its own water tank.\nCircling back to floor type, the Matrix Plus probably wouldn't be the best choice for homes with a heavy rug situation, as the bot requires you to manually highlight rugs or carpets in the app and can't vacuum while the water tank is attached.\nWhy we picked this\nShark became relevant in the robot vacuum game again when it introduced its Matrix cleaning mode in 2022. I first experienced it when testing the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 and was pumped by the simplicity and reliability of its spot cleaning in particular. Though the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 has since been surpassed as the fanciest Shark hybrid, its combination of affordability, straightforward mapping, and meticulous cleaning keep it as a top pick.\nShark's Matrix mode cleans better in selected rooms or zones in the app by going over the target area from multiple angles to suck up or scrub anything that may have been missed on the first pass. During regular vacuuming, Matrix mode cleans carpet 30 percent more thoroughly than the older RV Shark models, and during mopping, the mopping pad vibrates 1,000 times per second to put in a little more work on larger spills that need an extra wipe, or light dried-on stains.\nIn my testing, I watched the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 successfully clear crumbs near the kitchen counter, kitty litter in my bathroom, and minor drops on hardwood or tile several times \u2014 messes that similarly-priced Roombas I tested couldn't conquer in one pass.\nDetails\nTopics Robot Vacuums Gadgets\nAre Shark robot vacuums as good as Roomba?\nThe short answer? It's complicated. That's not the definitive one-word answer you were hoping for, but making an unequivocal call between the two brands just wouldn't make sense. Both vacuum brands are constantly improving their product lineups and introducing new features. Both brands have several options with mopping, smart room mapping, and automatic emptying, including vacs that can do all three or offer some mix-and-match combo of those features.\nSo, where does Shark outperform the best Roombas? While Shark has way fewer options to choose from after iRobot randomly overhauled its Roomba lineup in March 2025, Sharks are more likely to be a bang for your buck than Roombas. Shark consistently puts out more budget-friendly robot vacuums, often without skimping on the most crucial features. If you were capping yourself at $300, the $300 Shark vacuum is going to be more competent than the $300 Roomba (unless you're finding a premium Roomba on sale for that price).\nAdmittedly, Shark takes a little longer to roll out new features and doesn't have product drops very often. (For instance, it was late to self-emptying, self-washing, and self-drying compared to iRobot \u2014 and everyone else, for that matter.) But when Shark does release a model with new in-demand features, it's typically at a much more digestible price than the competition. Even Shark's most premium robot vacuum, the Shark PowerDetect 2-in-1 with NeverTouch Pro Base, debuted at around $400 less than the most premium Roomba, the Roomba Combo 10 Max + AutoWash Dock, despite them being nearly identical in capabilities.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nShark robot vacuums are classified in a few different ways, which manifest as random jumbles of numbers and letters in each robot vacuum's official name. IQ versus AI and RV versus AV were the main ones for several years, but new terminology like Matrix, PowerDetect, and Ultra have entered the Shark glossary as of 2025.\nThe difference between Shark IQ and AI is that Shark AI vacuums use 360-degree LiDAR mapping that allows the robot vacuum to create a map of your home and remember each room for more specified cleaning runs when necessary. Shark IQ vacuums, however, do not have smart mapping capabilities, and clean in a methodical row-by-row pattern created as the robot senses walls and large obstacles in each room.\nAnother main difference between Shark AI and IQ is that the newer AI models \u2014 now referred to as Shark Matrix Plus \u2014 have improved edge cleaning (called CleanEdge) that Shark says yields 50% better edge cleaning than the IQ models that do not have this technology.\nMatrix also refers to Shark's more thorough cleaning system for both wet and dry cleaning. During regular vacuuming, Matrix mode delivers 30% better carpet cleaning (compared to the older RV Shark models) by digging deeper into carpet and taking multiple passes in a crosshatch pattern to loosen and grab debris from multiple angles. During mopping, \"Matrix\" mode scrubs by vibrating 100 times per minute (rather than lightly dragging a wet cloth across hard floors). The self-emptying docks that come with Matrix Plus models also have a HEPA anti-allergen seal.\nThe difference between Shark RV and AV is one extra floor sensor that AV models have, making them slightly more perceptive. Sometimes, RV and AV models also come in different color options.\nTo tell the difference between two aesthetically-similar models, you can look at features like the type of brushroll built into the vacuum to decide which will supply the best debris pickup for your home. For instance, the RV2300S Matrix features a multi-surface brusholl, which would be the better choice for homes with one or no pets and widely varying floor types, while the RV2320S has a self-cleaning brushroll, which features anti-hair wrap technology and would be the better choice for pet hair pickup.\nShark EZ and Shark VacMop are older, less advanced product lines that now see limited distribution.\nThe newest Shark release doesn't exactly follow any of these classification rules. Its title simply describes what it does, and what it does sets it apart from all of the other models: Shark PowerDetect (technology that works harder on dirtier spots) NeverTouch Pro (a dock that you'll never have to touch, because the base deals with the dustbin and mopping pads on its own) Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo (it does both, and does them better than any Shark robot vacuums before it.)\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "Robot vacuums vs. stick vacuums: Shopping advice from someone who has both\nTable of Contents\nDetermining whether you should buy a stick vacuum or a robot vacuum requires more than a surface-level comparison of suction power or battery life. It involves a cold, hard look in the mirror and some introspection: How often would you realistically do the cleaning yourself?\nFactors like the size of your home and whether you have pets do matter, of course. But the stick vacuum vs. robot vacuum conversation really comes down to how picky you are about cleanliness and whether or not you care enough to ensure the vacuuming job is done thoroughly by doing it manually. I have both types of vacuums in my apartment, and have tested dozens of models of each variety over the past few years. I'm breaking down the pros and cons of each below.\nThe case for a robot vacuum\n\"The only way my house is going to get vacuumed every day is if a robot does it.\" I've heard that sentiment from more than one person when they ask me for a vacuum recommendation. If that resonates, you should definitely choose a robot vacuum.\nIt's also much easier to find a robot vacuum that mops than a stick vacuum that mops. Is the scrubbing as thorough as what you may be able to do with a manual mop? No, but automated mopping is more sanitary than forgetting to mop your floor for months on end. My favorite robot vacuum of 2025, the Roborock Saros 10R, is actually really good at mopping in corners, too.\nRobot vacuums are typically less work to maintain as well. It's more common than not for robot vacuums to auto-empty nowadays. Self-emptying robot vacuums deal with their own dustbins for several weeks (up to a few months) at a time. Many mopping robot vacuums can also refill their own water tanks and wash and dry their own mopping pads after each use. Parents or folks with busy schedules would probably appreciate the ability to set a robot vac to clean before they even get home, even if the clean isn't 100 percent as meticulous as a human wielding a cordless vacuum.\nSome robot vacuums take automation further with features like small obstacle avoidance and livestream pet cameras. These take the hands-off-ness of it all up a notch \u2014 you're less likely to come home to a robot vacuum stuck on a sucked-up sock, or can check in on your pets when you're not home. However, it's important to keep in mind that you'd be paying a lot more to keep your robot vacuum out of trouble than you would if you were simply the one at home cleaning. The most advanced robot vacuums are generally much more expensive than the most advanced stick vacuums, costing between several hundred to even $1,000 or more for full automation.\nThe case for a stick vacuum\nNo one can argue with the fact that humans are just smarter cleaners than robotic vacuums. We can visualize the spots that need to be cleaned more scrupulously than a robot vacuum can, and sneak stick vacuums into tight spots that even the smartest robot vacuums can't figure out. There's a lot of furniture that's too low clearance for even the slimmest robot vacuums. The 2.85-inch Roborock Saros 10R that I love can't clean under my dresser or nightstand, but my Dyson V12 Detect Slim can.\nPhysically speaking, there are also a ton of spots where robot vacuums quite literally cannot clean, like furniture, staircases, ceiling corners, or car seats. If you have pets that hang out on (and shed on) your couch or bed, a stick vacuum that converts into a handheld is crucial.\nSuction power-wise, it's true that upright stick vacuums are generally more powerful than robot vacuums. I mean, there could be an instance where a really high-end robot vacuum with 22,000 Pa suction is more powerful than a cheap stick vacuum. But in general, if you're comparing models at similar price points, the cordless stick vacuum is probably going to have better suction. Some Dysons, in particular, also enhance cleaning thoroughness with a laser that illuminates microscopic dust or hair that you wouldn't have seen otherwise. My brain chemistry was altered when I first experienced the laser on my Dyson V12 Detect Slim, and I've never been able to go back.\nA few years ago, if you really wanted a vacuum that could empty itself, you'd be pretty firmly in robot vacuum territory. But now there are a ton of self-emptying cordless stick vacuums \u2014 I can't stop recommending the $549.99 Shark PowerDetect to people. Each time I hang it back up after cleaning, it automatically sucks the contents of its dust bin into the dock it charges on. That means I start every new cleaning session with an empty dust bin, and can literally see how much cat hair is coming off of the rug in one specific room. Dyson is the only main cordless vacuum brand that doesn't make a self-emptying vacuum yet.\nDepending on the storage situation in your home, a stick vacuum might be awkward to keep out of sight. For example, if you live in an apartment with limited closet space, storing a stick vacuum could be a pain. You'd either have to drill holes to hang it on the wall, shove it under a couch, or let it lean in the corner full time.\nThe case for getting both\nBut the answer I really want to give here is probably the most annoying one: Instead of choosing between a robot vacuum or a stick vacuum, just get both.\nThat sounds like a really expensive, really extra solution on its face. But it doesn't have to be. Let's say your budget was between $500 and $600 \u2014 a very common price point for a lot of mid-range vacuums of the robot and stick variety. Instead of going all in on one type of vacuum, you could be strategic and buy a $300 version of each (I've tested a ton of good, cheap robot vacuums, and Shark has several solid, affordable cordless vacuums). That way, you're securing hands-free light upkeep on a day-to-day basis, but have the option to do a more detailed manual cleaning when you have time.\n(Splitting the cost won't exactly work if you're not trying to spend more than, say, $200. In that case, refer to my arguments above.)\nI also think there's a real future for vacuums that are both. The affordable Eufy E20 3-in-1 is a robot vacuum that turns into a stick vacuum (a pretty powerful one at that), and that's exactly why it's my pick for the most underrated vacuum of 2025 so far. I'm convinced that practical versatility like that is quickly going to prove more valuable to the average person than super high-tech vacuum concepts like the $2,599 Roborock robot vacuum with a robotic arm... that misses half the time.\nTopics Robot Vacuums Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.
