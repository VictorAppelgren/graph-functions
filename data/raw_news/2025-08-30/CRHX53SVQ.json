      "text": "Former Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz has built a reputation for his off-the-cuff comments.\nThe Democratic Minnesota governor made no exception during a Center for American Progress (CAP) event on Friday morning called, \"What\u2019s Next: Conversations on the Path Forward.\"\nWalz said China might be the voice of \"moral authority\" following Israel's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and military leaders.\n\"Now, who is the voice in the world that can negotiate some type of agreement in this? Who holds the moral authority? Who holds the ability to do that? Because we are not seen as a neutral actor, and we maybe never were,\" Walz said of the U.S.' role in de-escalating tensions in the Middle East.\nTIM WALZ HOPES IT RAINS ON TRUMP'S MILITARY PARADE: 'I'M JUST GOING TO CONFESS'\nAccording to Walz, the U.S. once attempted \"to be somewhat of the arbitrator\" in those negotiations during the Iran Nuclear Deal, but he said Americans must face the reality that the \"neutral actor\" with the \"moral authority\" to lead negotiations in the Middle East \"might be the Chinese.\"\nTIM WALZ FLOATS CHINA AS 'NEUTRAL ACTOR' WITH 'MORAL AUTHORITY' TO NEGOTIATE MIDDLE EAST PEACE\nWalz didn't elaborate on why China would be that world leader.\nThe Minnesota Democrat also admitted he is hoping for rain during President Donald Trump's military parade.\n\"I have never so hoped for rain in my life,\" Walz said.\nTrump is hosting a massive Flag Day military parade on Saturday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to gather in the nation\u2019s capital to witness the historic parade, which also coincides with the president's 79th birthday.\n\"This is not Pyongyang on a Saturday,\" Walz said, referring to the capital of North Korea, which is a communist, totalitarian dictatorship. Walz has joined many Democrats, including those planning to protest on Saturday, in criticizing Trump's military parade by drawing comparisons to China and North Korea's military parades.\nTrump's military parade on Saturday comes amid escalated conflict in the Middle East, after Israel launched air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and military leaders, and Iran responded by launching missiles toward Israeli territory.\nWalz was ridiculed earlier this year for celebrating Tesla's stock drop as protests raged on, rejecting Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\"On the iPhone, they\u2019ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day \u2014 $225 and dropping,\" Walz said at the time.\nWalz on Friday said that speaking out against Musk and Tesla \"worked\" because it started to hurt the billionaire personally.\nThe Democrat, who rose to the national stage as former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during her brief 2024 presidential campaign, criticized Trump along his usual attack lines on Friday.\nWalz said Trump is \"incompetent at governing,\" and America is in a \"dangerous time\" under Trump's leadership, which he said is \"marching towards authoritarianism\" following the chaotic incident in which authorities forcibly removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., at a Department of Homeland Security press conference on Thursday.\nThe former vice presidential candidate also said he was successful in labeling Trump \"weird\" during the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\"I thought instead of making him a scary authoritarian wannabe who is incredibly dangerous, which I believe he is, I just thought, what a weird dude doing some of this stuff,\" Walz said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWalz added he \"got a bunch of heat\" for \"inciting violence because I said we should bully the c--- out of Donald Trump.\"\nEarlier this year, the Minnesota governor said Harris chose him as her running mate, in part, because, \"I could code talk to White guys watching football, fixing their truck\" and \"put them at ease,\" describing himself as the \"permission structure\" for White men from rural America to vote for Democrats.\n\"I think I'll give you pretty good stuff, but I'll also give you 10% problematic,\" he added.\nWalz laughed off criticism over inconsistencies in his background on the 2024 campaign trail, describing himself as a \"knucklehead.\""

      "text": "A new book on the end of Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign and the birth of Kamala Harris' sheds light on the process behind the vice president choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, a decision widely panned by pundits in retrospect.\n\"2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,\" released Tuesday by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, described a vetting process that came down to three finalists: Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\nAll three candidates did a final interview with Harris at her residence, the book explains, adding that when asked what they wanted to drink, Shapiro and Kelly chose water while Walz chose Diet Mountain Dew.\nAppeal with rural voters was a top priority for the Harris ticket and the book states that Harris\u2019s advisors felt that Walz was the best candidate to do that.\nTIKTOKER KNOCKS HARRIS' 'WEIRD' TAKE ON NEVER RELEASED INTERVIEW: 'NOT GOOD'\n\"Pelosi privately pushed for him too, because she\u2019d worked with him in Congress,\" the book said about the former House speaker. \"The pitch for Walz was straightforward: He could appeal to white voters across the Blue Wall states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) and hopefully help Harris with male voters. He\u2019d never lost election.\"\nWhile most political experts felt Shapiro, governor of a key swing state, was the most logical choice, the book states that the interview with Harris and Shapiro \"revealed the two were not a perfect match.\"\n\"He came across as overly ambitious, pushing Harris to define what his role would be. He also conceded it would not be natural for him to serve as someone\u2019s number two, leaving Harris with a bad impression,\" the book states.\nConversely, the authors explain that Walz was \"deferential\" while \"showing no interest in himself\" and \"flatly denied any interest in running for president.\"\nNANCY MACE BLASTS TIM WALZ AFTER HE FAILS TO DEFINE WHAT A WOMAN IS\n\"He went so far as to proactively volunteer reasons why she might not want to pick him,\" the book says. \"In his interview that Friday, he said he had never used a teleprompter before. On Sunday, he told Harris, \u2018I would understand if you went with someone else because I\u2019m really nervous about the debate, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do well.\u2019 Still, the vetting team did not fully appreciate his tendency to misspeak, his folksiness sometimes tipping into factual imprecision.\"\nWalz would ultimately draw intense scrutiny on the campaign trail for his \"folksiness\" with a series of blunders, including his characterization of his military service and a claim he was present at the Tiananmen Square massacre.\nThe book says Harris \"struggled\" deciding between Shapiro and Walz, believing that she had a better \"rapport\" with Walz but understood the importance of Pennsylvania. Harris\u2019 team, according to the book, told her that polling did not offer a clear answer as to which of the two candidates would help the ticket more.\n\"There was no empirical evidence that Shapiro would deliver Pennsylvania and with it the White House,\" the book said.\nAs Shapiro was being considered, many pundits speculated that his staunch support of Israel could be an issue given the progressive wing of the Democratic Party being vocally pro-Palestinian, resulting in protests, sometimes violent, across the country after Oct. 7.\nThe book said the Harris campaign was aware of that issue.\n\"Much of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party declared war on Shapiro, largely because of his support of Israel,\" the book said. \"Some Shapiro allies saw the criticism as deeply unfair and borderline antisemitic, since the governor was an observant Jew, but his positions on the Palestinian conflict broadly aligned with the Biden administration and the other vice presidential contenders. The lawyers vetting Shapiro did flag some comments they viewed as more incendiary, particularly as it related to pro- Palestinian protests on college campuses after the October 7 attacks.\"\n\"One that caught their attention was his commentary on CNN from April: \u2018We have to query whether or not we would tolerate this, if this were people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia, making comments about people who are African American in our communities.\u2019\"\nUltimately, the book says Harris \"went with her gut\" and chose Walz believing he was the \"better fit\" in a decision her staff was \"unanimously behind.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Walz's office and Shapiro's office declined to comment.\nAfter losing every battleground state and ultimately the presidency to Donald Trump, critics were quick to judge the Walz pick as a misstep by Harris.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The choice of Walz was only one of many disastrous mistakes but symptomatic of one larger problem \u2013 the Democratic Party leadership is too scared to say no to the hard-left progressive wing of the party,\" Julian Epstein, longtime Democratic operative and former chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital shortly after the election.\nRob Bluey, president and executive editor of The Daily Signal, told Fox News Digital in November that Harris picking Walz \"proved to be a disastrous decision that doomed Kamala Harris from the moment she made it.\"\n\"Not only was Walz ill-prepared for the national spotlight and media scrutiny, but Harris passed over several better options,\" Bluey said. \"Given how little Americans knew about Harris or her policy positions, they were right to question her judgment on this big decision.\""

      "text": "Former Democratic vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized the media for reporting on rifts within the Democratic Party amidst what he called a \"fascist\" takeover of the country by President Donald Trump.\nWalz gave a fiery speech on Monday in front of Democrats gathered for the party\u2019s summer strategy meetings in Minneapolis, where Democratic leadership is attempting to unify a party riddled with internal division.\nDuring the speech, Walz, a progressive who served as former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate in 2024, opined about his and Harris\u2019 2024 election loss, saying, \"We know [Harris] was the most qualified and would have been a fantastic president.\"\n\"We wouldn't wake up every day to a bunch of s--- on TV and a bunch of nonsense,\" he asserted. \"We would wake up to an adult with compassion and dignity and vision and leadership doing the work. Not a man child crying about whatever's wrong with him.\"\nDNC CHAIR DEMANDS DEMS STOP 'BRINGING A PENCIL TO A KNIFE FIGHT' AT FIERY SUMMER MEETING\nHe doubled down on some of the Democratic Party\u2019s more controversial platforms, saying, \"We're not shying away from diversity as a strength and equity as a goal and inclusion being the air we breathe. That's what we should be doing.\"\nThough doubling down on DEI, Walz criticized the media for reporting on Democratic infighting. He urged Democrats, \"Don't take the bait.\"\n\"It boggles my d--- mind that in the midst of a military takeover of our cities and the attempt to go into others, their flaunting of the rule of law, the cruelness and the unconstitutional nature of the way they're attacking our neighbors, that the press finds the need to talk about, \u2018Oh, there's a division in the Democratic Party,\u2019\" he railed, adding, \"There's a division in my d--- house and we're still married, and things are good. That's life!\"\n\"We can have our internal decision-making, our internal healthy debates. But \u2013 I refuse to believe \u2013 we do not have the luxury to fight amongst ourselves while that thing sits in the White House,\" said Walz as the crowd broke into cheers.\nTIM WALZ LEADING DEM EFFORT TO TURN BIPARTISAN GROUP AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP: REPORT\nHe asserted that Democrats \"are strong because we're held accountable,\" while he lamented it is easy to be a Republican.\n\"Think of how easy it would be to be a d--- Republican. Oh, what should I wear today? This stupid fricking red hat? What should I say today? I don't know, just make sure it's cruel. Who do we listen to? That guy? Oh, the felon in the White House? Yeah, I listen to him, and that will be fine,\" he said.\nHe went on to accuse Trump of unleashing fascist policies on the U.S., saying, \"I always get in trouble for it, I'll continue to say it. I don't think we do any favors when we don't name it. These are fascist policies\u2026 That is what they are.\"\nCommenting on Trump signing an executive order to crack down on the burning of the American flag, he accused the president of being concerned about flags with his face on them.\n\"Now he's talking about burning flags. He's going to have flag burning or whatever, because he knows there's a hell of a lot of flags with his picture on it that are going to get burned. There's a whole lot of that kind of crap that people are sick of,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nConcluding his remarks, Walz urged Democrats to start \"running to a better future.\"\n\"A future that includes everyone, a future where our children are valued and lifted up, a future where immigrants are celebrated just like our grandparents and parents were, a future where we ask people to pay their fair share while we make life a little bit easier for others, and we find joy in the things that you find personally joyful and I don't give a d--- what your neighbor thinks about those things,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we are here for.\""

      "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, MN. - As the Democratic National Committee (DNC) holds its annual summer meeting, party leaders and officials face a multitude of problems as they try to escape the political wilderness.\n\"There's no doubt that \u2026 we have work to do,\" DNC chair Ken Martin acknowledged in a sit-down interview this summer with Fox News Digital.\nMartin, who was elected DNC chair in February, noted that the party has continued to \"lose ground with many parts of our coalition.\"\nMartin addressed the more than 400 elected party officials from all 50 states and several territories, as the summer meeting kicked off at a downtown hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Monday morning.\nDNC CHAIR TELLS FOX NEWS PARTY HAS HIT \u2018ROCK BOTTOM\u2019\nThe party is trying to escape the political wilderness after last year's elections, when Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate and fell short in their bid to win back the House majority. And Republicans made gains with voters who make up key parts of the Democratic Party's base.\nBut the situation has only worsened for the Democrats in the 10 months since last year's election setbacks.\nThe Democrats' brand is deeply unpopular, especially with younger voters, as the party's poll numbers continue to drop to all-time lows in national surveys.\nDNC CHAIR TELLS FOX NEWS \u2018WE WANT EVERYONE\u2019 INCLUDING \u2018LEFTISTS\u2019 LIKE MAMDANI\nThe DNC faces a massive fundraising deficit at the hands of the rival Republican National Committee (RNC), fueled in part by major party donors cutting back their contributions as they express their frustrations with the national party committee.\nNew voter data first reported last week by the New York Times showed Democratic Party registration plunging while GOP sign-ups were on the rise in the 30 states that register voters by party.\nAnd while Democrats appear energized to fight the sweeping and controversial moves by President Donald Trump during his first seven months in office, they seem to be divided on how hard to push back against the new administration.\nThere's also a party divide over Israel's nearly two-year-old war with Hamas in Gaza, with dueling resolutions being the latest sign of the Democrats' once unshakeable support for the Jewish State fracturing.\nLONGTIME TRUMP ALLY TAKES OVER CHAIRING REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE\nDespite the DNC chair admitting they have issues, he saw a silver lining.\n\"When you hit rock bottom, there's only one direction to go, and that's up, and that's what we're doing,\" Martin said.\nMartin, in his speech on Monday in his home state, reiterated \"I'm sick and tired of this Democratic Party bringing a pencil to a knife fight. We cannot be the only party that plays by the rules anymore.\"\nAnd he repeatedly criticized Trump, calling him a \"dictator-in-chief\" and describing the president's second administration as \"facisim dressed in a red tie.\"\n\"We are the only things standing in his way,\" Martin emphasized. \"We are unified in stopping Donald Trump and putting this country back on track.\"\nFormer RNC chair Michael Whatley, who formally stepped down last week as he runs for the Senate, argued in a Fox News Digital interview that the Democrats \"are moving further and further and farther to the left. They are walking away from Main Street right now. They are beholden to left-wing radical woke policies.\"\n\"They haven't learned a single thing from their election losses in 2024,\" Whatley claimed.\nBut despite all the problems and setbacks facing the Democrats, they have enjoyed some victories of late.\nDemocrats have scored a slew of off-year and special election wins, ahead of next year's midterm elections, when the GOP will be defending its majorities in the House and Senate as the party in power will likely face historical political headwinds.\nDemocrats have also landed some top recruits - former Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina and former Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, in two of the most crucial 2026 Senate races.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnd while the Democratic Party's poll numbers are in the gutter, the approval and favorable ratings for Trump and the GOP are nothing to brag about. Plus, polls indicate that the so-called \u2018Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019 which is the Trump-inspired massive Republican domestic policy, tax cuts and spending law, remains unpopular with Americans.\nDespite the poll numbers, new RNC chair Joe Gruters told Fox News Digital last week that \"we have the momentum on our side, we have the issues on our side, and we have a president who cares about every single American. And we're gonna take that vision and push it all the way through the midterms.\"\nBut as he looks ahead to next year's midterm elections, Martin sees the GOP agenda as ammunition.\n\"We welcome the debate because this is the debate that's going to actually help us, as a Democratic Party, build our coalition again and win elections,\" the DNC chair insisted."
