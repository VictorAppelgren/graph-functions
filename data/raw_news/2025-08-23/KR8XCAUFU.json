  "title": "Review: Showing humanity at its worst, 'Eden' has gorgeous actors getting uncivilized on a remote island",
  "description": "A cast that includes Jude Law, Ana de Armas and Sydney Sweeney assembles for an occasionally campy survival-of-the-fittest thriller directed by, of all people, Ron Howard.",
  "content": "Ron Howard\u2019s new film \u201cEden\u201d is a true story about disenchanted Europeans, who, in the 1930s, escaped from their society and decamped on a lonely rock in the Galapagos, only to see their handmade utopia devolve into petty power struggles and murder. It\u2019s also lurid proof that Charles Darwin missed out on the truly juicy survival-of-the-fittest action by about a hundred years.\n\nThis is certainly unusual material for a mainstream stalwart like Howard, who knows his way around heroic problem-solving narratives (\u201cApollo 13,\u201d the Thai cave rescue movie \u201cThirteen Lives\u201d). But in screenwriter Noah Pink\u2019s melodramatic imagining of incidents both well-documented and mysterious, one can see this Hollywood veteran on a mission to loosen the shackles of his reputation and have some nasty, brutish fun. To wit: A perma-sneering Jude Law greets intruders naked; a wild-eyed Ana de Armas insults and tries to seduce everyone; Vanessa Kirby lets foreplay include the pulling of her diseased tooth; Sydney Sweeney gives birth alone while growling at a pack of wild dogs.\n\nThe result may not be terribly illuminating about the (sub)human condition, despite the shout-outs to Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. \u201cEden\u201d is probably closer to an expensive reality show about mismatched survivalists. But as August fare goes, it\u2019s a sticky, sweaty hoot, well cast and paced like a disreputable beach read, even if you might sporadically wish Werner Herzog had gotten first crack at this material. (It was also covered in a 2013 documentary.)\n\nThe first transplants to the uninhabited island of Floreana were German botanist Dr. Friedrich Ritter (Law) and his devoted, ailing partner, Dore (Kirby). Scolds who glorified suffering against the world\u2019s wrong turns, the pair sought a radical reboot of society in rugged isolation, save the inconvenient fact that Ritter\u2019s grandstanding philosophical missives back home were published in newspapers, turning them into eccentric folk heroes. Soon, their precious suffering took the form of new neighbors: idealistic war veteran Heinz Wittmer (Daniel Br\u00fchl) and his wide-eyed young wife Margret (Sweeney), who are looking for a new, self-sufficient way of life for their budding family.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine a worse addition to this oil-and-water mix of high-minded nonconformist cranks and hard-toiling middle-class settlers than a capitalist sybarite. Enter the grandiose Baroness Eloise (De Armas), carried like Cleopatra onto the beach by her male lovers (Toby Wallace and Felix Klammerer), and ready to claim Floreana as the future site of an exclusive luxury resort called Hacienda Paradiso. Her first order of business, however, is pitting the scowling Ritter and bland, industrious Wittmers, who had managed a bearable distance so far, against each other.\n\nThe island, given an appropriately sickly, uninviting sheen by cinematographer Mathias Herndl, clearly wasn\u2019t big enough for all of these new-world experimenters. But the movie\u2019s two hours offer plenty of room for their portrayers. Howard\u2019s generosity with his actors keeps this ensemble a charged group of clashing molecules. You wouldn\u2019t mistake anybody\u2019s turn for a full-throated or, conversely, subtle characterization \u2014 there\u2019s a messiness to the cutting that prioritizes motion over stillness \u2014 but the broad strokes of personality are fun.\n\nAt its most raw (or is it overcooked?), when de Armas\u2019 loaded-gun vibe veers toward camp or Law peacocks his pomposity with a hint of desperation, the situation may remind you of some insane pre-Code potboiler like 1932 \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game,\u201d when a tale of people at their worst seemed all the more fascinating for unfurling in an exotic locale. Just because this corrupting pity party doesn\u2019t crescendo so much as peter out isn\u2019t any more of a reason to dismiss \u201cEden.\u201d A little time spent with the farcical maneuverings of isolated megalomaniacs means you can skip reading the news that day.",

      "text": "Sundance waves goodbye with stories pitched between fame and obsession\n- Share via\nPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 Park City got a hot blast of star power when Jennifer Lopez arrived Jan. 26 to launch Bill Condon\u2019s blazingly emotional adaptation of the Tony-winning stage musical \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman.\u201d Lopez plays dual roles as a movie actor and an arachnoid goddess and she sauntered into the Sundance Film Festival premiere channeling the power of both. Jeans and snow boots? Acceptable attire for mere mortals. Lopez wore a cobweb-and-lace see-through gown and heels. Her weather-defying glamour was so dazzling that everyone in my shuttle the next morning was talking about it \u2014 while also being boggled that Lopez\u2019s little-known co-star, the monomonikered Tonatiuh, somehow stole his share of the spotlight.\nSundance was created to launch talents like Tonatiuh, a young actor from Los Angeles, who\u2019s fantastic as a prison inmate who papers his cell with posters of Lopez\u2019s fantasy icon. I\u2019d seen his face once before in the background of the Netflix action movie \u201cCarry-On.\u201d Now, I\u2019ll watch a movie just because he\u2019s in it. This festival is where stars are born, even if it\u2019s gotten harder for an indie film to get financed without at least one recognizable name.\nThat\u2019s always been a little true. If a certain video-store clerk hadn\u2019t gotten his producer\u2019s acting teacher\u2019s wife to pass a script to Harvey Keitel, \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d might not have secured the cash, cast or clout to premiere at Sundance in 1992. How different would today\u2019s Hollywood look if no one had ever seen that dizzying opening scene in which a breakfast table of crooks debates Madonna? How many potential Quentin Tarantinos never met their Keitel?\nFandom is a word more associated with glossy superhero blockbusters, but it was one of the through lines of this year\u2019s festival. Film after film tugged at the fragile balance between object and admirer, the vital symbiosis between artist and audience, the vulnerability of knowing that any towering career \u2014 even Lopez\u2019s \u2014 could topple over without anyone there to applaud. In \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman,\u201d Tonatiuh functions as both Lopez\u2019s disciple and her defender. When his cynical cellmate (Diego Luna) suggests that Lopez\u2019s character suffers from childhood trauma, Tonatiuh groans, \u201cUgh, let her be.\u201d\nI adored \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman.\u201d That it left Sundance without distribution is a shock. At least director James Griffiths\u2019 \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island,\u201d a major crowd-pleaser, will be in theaters by the end of the next month. It\u2019s about a socially awkward lottery winner named Charles (Tim Key), a chatterbox with the patter of a Borscht Belt comic, who offers his favorite folk duo nearly $1 million to play a reunion show. (Devotees of the British game show \u201cTaskmaster\u201d will recognize Key from Season 1.) There\u2019s a catch: The gig is on a remote beach for an audience of one. Worse, the bandmates, Herb (Tom Basden) and Nell (Carey Mulligan), are estranged exes. Herb sold out and got famous; Nell quit the business to sell artisanal jam. Neither is able to ignore a briefcase of money dangled by their No. 1 fan.\nHerb spends most of the movie scowling, as he suspects that Charles wants the duo to reunite on stage and in bed. Eventually, Herb snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re like a cut-price Geppetto,\u201d he snarls. Yet, whenever Key\u2019s lonely widower drops his desperation to amuse, there\u2019s years of pain on his face. Key, Basden and Griffiths have been trying to expand their original BAFTA-nominated short, \u201cThe One and Only Herb McGwyer Plays Wallis Island,\u201d for 18 years. The feature needed a star of Mulligan\u2019s scale to get made. I\u2019m glad it did.\nThat Geppetto insult was dangling over my head when I sat down for \u201cLurker,\u201d yet another fraught comedy about artists and fans. An underground musician (Archie Madekwe) risks his own rise to fame when a manipulative Instagram stalker (Th\u00e9odore Pellerin) hitches his own future to the singer\u2019s ascent. Tense, uncomfortable and choke-on-your-own-anxiety funny, this first feature by Alex Russell, a writer on \u201cBeef\u201d and \u201cThe Bear,\u201d was one of most skillful delights of the festival, even if the movie itself seems on the fence about whether it believes in talent or opportunism. At its most on-the-nose, \u201cLurker\u201d repeatedly plays the same song: the tinkling 1960s R&B ballad \u201cI\u2019m Your Puppet.\u201d But every time you hear it, someone else is yanking the strings.\n\u201cOpus\u201d heightens the stakes by pitting a pop megastar named Moretti (John Malkovich) against a magazine journalist, Ariel (Ayo Edibiri). A debut horror film by the former GQ writer Mark Anthony Green, it had a sprinkling of wit and insight plus a surprising amount of Malkovich sex appeal. Still, it didn\u2019t seize the moment to say much of anything. Does Moretti start knocking off Ariel\u2019s colleagues because they\u2019re too obsequious or not slavish enough? The movie opened strong but came to feel like a tribute band that exists only because they came up with the perfect punny name. (Not you, burger-themed metal band Mac Sabbath \u2014 you\u2019re perfect.)\nWe came to Park City, Utah, with huge appetites for the 41st annual Sundance Film Festival. But we\u2019re trimming down our top picks to the very best of the best.\nThere\u2019s more death and saxophones in Gala del Sol\u2019s \u201cRains Over Babel,\u201d a mythological fantasia set in a Colombia nightclub that doubles as a portal to heaven (and hell). One track of the plot follows the bar\u2019s owner\u2019s son (Jose Mojica) and a luckless gambler (Celina Biurrun) on a dangerous mission to rescue the town\u2019s most popular jazz-band leader (Jacobo Velez) from a maze of bondage mask-clad Minotaurs. Meanwhile, back on the dance floor, a diva named La Flaca (Saray Rebolledo) has the power to control death itself. One puke-smeared drug overdose victim refuses to accept that this is his last party.\nIt\u2019s a lot of movie, even without the sassy talking lizard or the drag performer (William Hurtado) who disobeys his pastor father by yanking on a light-up afro wig and strutting onstage to slay. The film, a sequined hat on a hat on a hat, can feel a bit overburdened by literary allusions. (There\u2019s a character named Dante.) Still, from costumes to makeup to ambition, the razzle-dazzle is impressive.\nIn Argentine filmmaker Laura Casab\u00e9\u2019s \u201cThe Virgin of Quarry Lake,\u201d a name-dropper incites violence just being adjacent to celebrity. This glancingly supernatural teen nightmare gets grisly when a social climber named Silvia (Fernanda Echevarr\u00eda) barges into a small clique and claims to have all sorts of famous friends. Silvia\u2019s braggadocio wins her the attention of a heartthrob named Diego (Agust\u00edn Sosa) \u2014 and the wrath of local beauty Natalia (Dolores Oliverio), who has always believed that Diego was hers. Imagine \u201cCarrie\u201d with a spoiled girl.\nSet in 2001, the movie hangs out in the internet cafes that are just coming into popular use. Yet, there\u2019s already a sense that this new millennium is collapsing. The electricity won\u2019t stay on, the water is permanently off, the bloodstain in front of Natalia\u2019s house gets bigger by the day. If you don\u2019t like gore, I\u2019d close your eyes for the bludgeoning that takes place during the first five minutes. The film ends in a rush, simply dropping the mic and running off. Before it does, however, \u201cQuarry Lake\u201d is confident and gripping.\nThe most mortal tale of hero worship was Sophie Hyde\u2019s semi-autobiographical \u201cJimpa,\u201d an endearing family drama about an iconic gay-rights activist, Jim (John Lithgow), and his non-binary grandchild Frances (Aud Mason-Hyde), whom he affectionately calls his \u201cgrandthing.\u201d Jim lives in Amsterdam; Frances was raised in Australia with their mom, Hannah (Olivia Colman), who was left behind when her dad set out to be his truest self.\nThe film starts with both Frances and Hannah rhapsodizing about Jim from a distance, saying all the things you\u2019re supposed to say about marginalized people who have lived their lives courageously. They leave out that Jim is also selfish, close-minded and flaky: a conversational tyrant who controls the volume of every chat. Frances simply doesn\u2019t know him that well. Mason-Hyde, the director\u2019s own child, is a natural performer, while Colman\u2019s Hannah has decades of experience suppressing her resentments. Playing a filmmaker based on Hyde herself, she claims it\u2019s possible to make a movie that celebrates her iconic father\u2019s life without any conflict.\nTo Hyde\u2019s credit, her script zags away from sentimentality as much as it zigs. Things drag a little in \u201cJimpa\u2019s\u201d last stretch, but you come away believing that an uplifting sermon is no way to honor your idol. That kind of fanboy speech shuts down difficult questions. Good movies ask them."

      "text": "- Share via\nIn just the past few months, Sydney Sweeney has changed. Already a two-time Emmy nominee for her roles on \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cThe White Lotus,\u201d she starred in and produced the worldwide box-office hit \u201cAnyone but You.\u201d\nSuch is Sweeney\u2019s current career trajectory that she is unfazed by the severe, mocking response to the recent disappointment \u201cMadame Web,\u201d saying, \u201cI was just hired as an actress in it, so I was just along for the ride for whatever was going to happen.\u201d\nNow comes her intense horror film \u201cImmaculate,\u201d premiering Tuesday night at the South by Southwest Film and TV Festival, with Sweeney again starring and producing. The thriller reunites her with director Michael Mohan, the two having previously worked together on the Netflix high school dramedy series \u201cEverything Sucks\u201d and the Prime Video erotic thriller \u201cThe Voyeurs.\u201d\n\u201cImmaculate,\u201d with a screenplay credited to Andrew Lobel, follows a devout American woman, Cecilia, who makes her way to a remote Italian convent. She becomes pregnant while still a virgin \u2014 a seemingly miraculous event that soon takes a sinister turn. Mohan cites classics such as \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 \u201cThe Devils\u201d as inspirations; his film also features a supporting cast of European talent such as \u201cMoney Heist\u2019s\u201d \u00c1lvaro Morte, \u201cWhite Lotus\u2019 \u201d Simona Tabasco and \u201cAmanda\u2019s\u201d Benedetta Porcaroli.\nSweeney, 26, recently hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d, only to be in Paris by Tuesday for a Miu Miu fashion show and then back in New York on Wednesday to join Mohan, 44, via Zoom for our joint interview. Just a few days later she was in Los Angeles for the Vanity Fair post-Oscars party, where she wore a dress previously worn by Angelina Jolie to the 2004 Academy Awards.\n\u201cImmaculate\u201d will be released later this month by Neon. Though the following conversation does touch on the movie\u2019s startling ending, there are no spoilers beyond anything that\u2019s already in the film\u2019s trailer.\nSydney, it\u2019s already part of the origin story of \u201cImmaculate\u201d that you auditioned for this 10 years ago and then revived the project. What was it about this story that stuck with you?\nSWEENEY: Originally the script was vastly different. Once I got my hands on it and we hired Michael, we drastically revised it so that it could fit who I am today and the world today. But the through line of the story always has stayed the same. And I think one of the reasons I loved it so much was that some of the scariest and most raw, guttural moments in this movie are in real life.\nYou and Michael had a working relationship already, but what made you turn to him to be involved?\nSWEENEY: I feel like we have grown up in this industry together. Michael was one of the first filmmakers to actually believe in me to be able to have a regular role on a TV show. And I was 19 years old. After working on \u201cEverything Sucks\u201d and \u201cVoyeurs,\u201d you can just communicate with someone differently. Mike and I can just look at each other and we know what we\u2019re thinking. We know what needs to be fixed. We know what\u2019s working without even having to say a word. And having a filmmaker like that on your team is so beneficial to having a project just flow. And it was also my baby and I knew that he wasn\u2019t going to come on and then push me aside.\nNow shooting Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man universe action film, \u201cMadame Web,\u201d the young actor has shed her early struggles and self-doubts.\nMichael, what was your reaction when you first got the script?\nMOHAN: I was terrified to read it. I knew Syd was making this movie with or without me. And we had shared some scripts before and some of the scripts that I had read I didn\u2019t feel like I was uniquely suited to. And I didn\u2019t want to just sign on just to sign on. I wanted to feel like I could elevate what was there. And when I read the script, the concept just felt so plausible and it felt very terrifying and prescient. The twist that the narrative takes I didn\u2019t see coming. As someone who writes movies with twist endings, that\u2019s a big deal.\nBut also, I just really wanted to work with Syd again. It\u2019s just so easy. I don\u2019t want to deconstruct it too much. It\u2019s this appreciation for the craft of our crew and what they bring to it.\nHow did the script change from what it originally was?\nSWEENEY: It drastically changed \u2014 location, age, characters, a lot of it.\nMOHAN: The main thing was, in the early draft, she was a high school student. And so by changing the character to a nun, it gave us a much broader character arc to play. Even though the movie\u2019s really short, she starts in one place that is so vastly different from where we leave her. And knowing that you\u2019ve got an actor as good as Syd in your back pocket to perform it, she\u2019s going to be able to accomplish it effortlessly. I just have to keep her in focus.\nAnytime I would come up with a new idea, they would just immediately go, \u201cBut is it scary?\u201d And their whole thing was just: This needs to be really scary. And I give them all the credit for pushing me in all the right ways.\nSydney, talk about your move into producing. Is this about you taking more control of the material you\u2019re agreeing to be a part of?\nSWEENEY: I am a very hands-on collaborator. I like being able to give ideas, be a part of it, help come up with solutions. It just changes the whole process. It\u2019s so hard for me now to be on a set and not be able to help in any type of way and be able to take action. And being able to actually have a voice and have a valued opinion \u2014 it means so much.\nAnd I still have a billion things to learn, but I love being able to be a part of the process from the beginning to the end. I\u2019ve always built my characters from the ground up. And so I feel like I\u2019m getting to do that on an entire script-level.\nMOHAN: I also think that, quite frankly, Syd has her finger on the pulse of what her generation wants to see. And so you understand that: Hey, there aren\u2019t rom-coms out there, so you know what? I\u2019m going to find one, I\u2019m going to make it my own. I\u2019m going to make it as cinematic as I can. And of course, it was successful. You knew that.\nDo you see it that way, Sydney?\nSWEENEY: I mean, it definitely helps when you\u2019re the same age as the audience.\nMichael, what has it been like for you to see Sydney evolve as a performer and as a persona, a celebrity, since you first met her?\nMOHAN: It\u2019s unsurprising, to be honest. We sort of knew when we cast her in \u201cEverything Sucks.\u201d This is a born leader. Even back then, Syd really helped us in terms of the morale of the cast. She was the camp counselor to the rest of the kids, the actors who were younger than her. The fact that she\u2019s doing everything right now and is everywhere and all over the place, it\u2019s just like, of course.\nI\u2019m just glad that you\u2019re getting roles that are even more challenging. To me, that\u2019s the fun part, catching a movie like \u201cReality\u201d or even seeing that scene in \u201cAnyone but You\u201d where you climb over the armrest \u2014 the physical-comedy thing where your butt is in his face. It\u2019s just so funny. I\u2019d never seen you do that before. And so it\u2019s really \u2014\nSWEEENEY: How much of a dork I am. That\u2019s the thing. I am actually super dorky. I make very sarcastic dry remarks, and everyone close to me knows in real life I\u2019m more of a comedian than a dramatic person.\nYou seem really unafraid of using your body in your performances, including taking off your clothes. And this role feels different. For the most part, it\u2019s more contained and buttoned-up. How conscious a decision was that for you?\nSWEENEY: It didn\u2019t serve the character. It\u2019s always whether it serves the character or not. I\u2019m living someone else\u2019s life. So if it serves to the development or the emotional state of a character, then it makes sense. But she was a nun. It didn\u2019t make sense.\nMichael, was that something you thought about \u2014 how much you were going to lean into the exploitation side of a nunsploitation movie?\nMOHAN: Well, I don\u2019t want to be known as the guy who makes movies where Sydney gets naked. I don\u2019t want that reputation. However, I will say, Syd, when we decided to stage the scene with you and Benedetta in a bathhouse, we knew that would have a sensual feeling to it.\nSWEENEY: And it\u2019s just like if she was in the bathhouse, she would just be wearing her overdress, her bathing dress, and no bra. And so it\u2019s truthfully just whatever the character would do. I never think about it. I mean, the character wouldn\u2019t wear a bra in most of the stuff, so I didn\u2019t wear a bra. It just depends on the character. I truly just look at everything like that.\nMohan: I was probably more concerned about it than you because I remember after we shot that first take, I was like, \u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s so sheer. Is this OK?\u201d And you were like, \u201cNo, this is beautiful. Don\u2019t overthink it.\u201d\nNow I want to ask you about some of what happens in the movie, but I don\u2019t want you to feel like we\u2019re spoiling anything. How are you talking about the film?\nMOHAN: This is the first interview we\u2019ve done together, so I think we\u2019re figuring it out.\nSWEENEY: We definitely don\u2019t want to spoil the ending. We really want people to discover it for themselves. Granted, people write reviews and that\u2019ll be out there, but we\u2019re trying really hard not to spoil the ending. I will say that was the first take. That was one take.\nMOHAN: We did shoot alternates. We covered ourselves in case audiences rejected the execution that we went for. But when we did the take, it was undeniable. We saw it and we were just like: This is unbelievable. This is what it is. And thankfully, everybody supported us.\nThe only thing I can say is whenever you\u2019re on set and you see Syd do this, it\u2019s genuinely like watching someone do a magic trick, because the instant I call cut, it\u2019s just like, boom, back to Syd. And it\u2019s like nothing. Sometimes as a director, the best direction you can give is to stay the f\u2014 out of someone\u2019s way.\nSydney, where does that come from, that ability to turn a character on and off like that?\nSWEENEY: When I was first starting, I had \u2014 I don\u2019t even know that you would call him a life coach or not, not quite an acting coach, but it was my friend\u2019s dad. So Kodi Smit-McPhee [of \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d], his dad, Andy McPhee, would help Kodi build his characters. And so I started working with Andy and we would just talk character work. It wouldn\u2019t be rehearsing, wouldn\u2019t be running lines, it would be truly just talking about the characters and building who they were.\nAnd the number one thing he always told me was to make sure that I separated myself as much as possible from my characters. Don\u2019t put any of my own memories, emotions, feelings, people, relationships, anything in the thoughts of my characters, so that I can jump in and out.\nSydney, even just within the last couple weeks, it seems like your fame has grown. Does it feel to you like things are accelerating too fast?\nSWEENEY: I am such a homebody that life kind of stays the same for me. I just hang out with my dog and my family and my close friends. There\u2019s just more people who say hi to me when I go outside. That\u2019s all.\nDoes it all just seem normal to you now?\nSWEENEY: Nothing about this industry is normal. And I think it\u2019s really important to remember that."

      "text": "Apollo 13 moon mission leader James Lovell dies at 97\n- Share via\nCHICAGO \u2014 James Lovell \u2014 the commander of Apollo 13 who helped turn a failed moon mission into a triumph of on-the-fly, can-do engineering \u2014 has died. He was 97.\nLovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Ill., NASA said in a statement on Friday.\n\u201cJim\u2019s character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,\u201d NASA said. \u201cWe mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.\u201d\nOne of NASA\u2019s most traveled astronauts in the agency\u2019s first decade, Lovell flew four times \u2014 Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 \u2014 with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth.\nIn 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth\u2019s orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. They could not land there, but the mission put the U.S. ahead of the Soviets in the space race. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew\u2019s Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968.\nBut the big rescue mission was still to come. That was during the harrowing Apollo 13 flight in April 1970. Lovell was supposed to be the fifth man to walk on the moon. But Apollo 13\u2019s service module, carrying Lovell and two others, experienced a sudden oxygen tank explosion on its way to the moon. The astronauts barely survived, spending four cold and clammy days in the cramped lunar module as a lifeboat.\n\u2018\u2019The thing that I want most people to remember is [that] in some sense it was very much of a success,\u2019\u2019 Lovell said during a 1994 interview. \u2018\u2019Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of [NASA] personnel.\u2019\u2019\nA retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about crises any longer,\u201d he said in 1999. Whenever he has a problem, \u201cI say, \u2018I could have been gone back in 1970. I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still breathing.\u2019 So, I don\u2019t worry about crises.\u201d\nAnd the mission\u2019s retelling in the 1995 movie \u201cApollo 13\u201d brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame \u2014 thanks in part to Lovell\u2019s movie persona reporting: \u201cHouston, we have a problem\u201d \u2014 a phrase he didn\u2019t exactly utter.\nLovell had ice water in his veins like other astronauts, but he didn\u2019t display the swagger some had, just quiet confidence, said Smithsonian Institution historian Roger Launius. He called Lovell \u201ca very personable, very down-to-earth type of person who says: \u2018This is what I do. Yes, there\u2019s risk involved. I measure risk.\u2019\u201d\nIn all, Lovell flew four space missions \u2014 and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds.\nAboard Apollo 8, Lovell described the oceans and land masses of Earth. \u201cWhat I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not,\u201d he remarked.\nThat mission may be as important as the historic Apollo 11 moon landing, a flight made possible by Apollo 8, Launius said.\n\u201cI think in the history of spaceflight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program,\u201d Gene Kranz, NASA\u2019s legendary flight director, once said.\nBut if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell\u2019s last mission \u2014 immortalized by the film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell \u2014 that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut.\nThe Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on its way to the moon when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth.\nThat, Lovell recalled, was \u201cthe most frightening moment in this whole thing.\u201d Then oxygen began escaping and \u201cwe didn\u2019t have solutions to get home.\u201d\n\u201cWe knew we were in deep, deep trouble,\u201d he told NASA\u2019s historian.\nFour-fifths of the way to the moon, NASA scrapped the mission. Suddenly, their only goal was to survive.\nLovell\u2019s \u201cHouston, we\u2019ve had a problem\u201d \u2014 a variation of a comment Swigert had radioed moments before \u2014 became famous. In Hanks\u2019 version, it became \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d\nWhat unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission.\nWith Lovell commanding the spacecraft, Kranz led hundreds of flight controllers and engineers in a furious rescue plan.\nThe plan involved the astronauts moving from the service module, which was hemorrhaging oxygen, into the cramped, dark and frigid lunar lander while they rationed their dwindling oxygen, water and electricity. Using the lunar module as a lifeboat, they swung around the moon, aimed for Earth and raced home.\nBy coolly solving the problems under the most intense pressure imaginable, the astronauts and the crew on the ground became heroes. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA\u2019s finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong\u2019s and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s walks on the moon nine months earlier.\n\u201cThey demonstrated to the world they could handle truly horrific problems and bring them back alive,\u201d said Launius.\nThe loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon \u201cis my one regret,\u201d Lovell said in a 1995 interview.\nPresident Clinton agreed when he awarded Lovell the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1995. \u201cWhile you may have lost the moon ... you gained something that is far more important perhaps: the abiding respect and gratitude of the American people,\u201d he said.\nLovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, \u201cthe mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction.\u201d\nAnd Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal.\n\u201cGoing to the moon, if everything works right, it\u2019s like following a cookbook. It\u2019s not that big a deal,\u201d he said in 2004. \u201cIf something goes wrong, that\u2019s what separates the men from the boys.\u201d\nJames A. Lovell was born March 25, 1928, in Cleveland. He attended the University of Wisconsin before transferring to the U.S. Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Md.\nA test pilot at the Navy Test Center in Patuxent River, Md., Lovell was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1962. He was the last of that second group of astronauts \u2014 called \u201cthe Next Nine\u201d \u2014 alive and thus had been an astronaut longer than any other person alive.\nLovell retired from the Navy and from the space program in 1973, and went into private business. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote \u201cLost Moon,\u201d the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film \u201cApollo 13.\u201d In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.\nHe and his family ran a now-closed restaurant in suburban Chicago, Lovell\u2019s of Lake Forest.\nHis wife, Marilynn, died in 2023. Survivors include four children.\nIn a statement, his family hailed him as their \u201chero.\u201d\n\u201cWe will miss his unshakable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible,\u201d his family said. \u201cHe was truly one of a kind.\u201d\nBabwin is a former Associated Press writer.

It\u2019s been created, mostly written and directed in part by Noah Hawley, who helmed the successful televisionization of \u201cFargo\u201d and the marvelous Marvel-based \u201cLegion.\u201d As with \u201cFargo,\u201d he\u2019s made something true to the spirit of the original yet colored by his own goofy predilections. Hawley has a penchant for poetic concepts, literary references, political inferences and out-of-the-mainstream ideas that may not always make perfect sense, but his ambition shows through. He knows how to keep things interesting over a long series, and he understands the assignment here.\n\u201cAlien: Earth\u201d is darker \u2014 or, I should say, more relentlessly dark \u2014 than either of those series, and a sensitive viewer might want to consider the wear and tear eight hours of body horror and rarely relieved tension might have on a human. Even when the mood is relatively light for a moment, you know what\u2019s coming. And it comes.\nWatch our exclusive follow-along with the cast of FX\u2019s \u2018Alien: Earth\u2019 cast at San Diego Comic-Con as they sign autographs, visit the show\u2019s immersive activation and more.\nIt\u2019s rare that a newcomer joins the ranks of the famous monsters of Filmland \u2014 Frankenstein\u2019s creature, Dracula, the Wolfman, King Kong, Godzilla, that lot \u2014 but the H.R. Giger-designed Alien, or Xenomorph, has definitely made the cut. A big vulpine armored lizard with a mouth inside a mouth, the better to eat you with \u2014 and it is a very messy eater \u2014 it is perhaps the most disturbing member of this club. At the same time, after nine films, we know its tricks pretty well, so that when a baby Alien pops out of someone\u2019s chest, as famously happened in the first picture, it\u2019s more a matter of, \u201cWell, they finally got around to that\u201d than, \u201cOh my God, can you believe what just happened?\u201d In recognition of the need for novel scares, the TV series offers a little tentacled eyeball monster, shaped and smart like an octopus, that zombifies its hosts.\nThe series begins in space, appropriately, aboard the USCSS Maginot. USCSS stands for United States Commercial Star Ship, though in the future that \u201cAlien: Earth\u201d posits, the world having been completely corporatized, \u201cunited states\u201d must be a vestigial concept, like the vermiform appendix or democracy. The year is 2120, just before the events of \u201cAlien,\u201d if you are interested in chronological order, and the ship belongs to the Weyland-Yutani corporation, which controls North and South America. Naming the ship Maginot, after a famously failed French defense in World War I, is clearly a little joke for history buffs, and also apt.\nThe crew, who are near the end of a 65-year mission \u2014 suspended animation keeps them young and pretty \u2014 are transporting an extraterrestrial bestiary back to Earth. Given the typical body count in these films, I declare it Not a Spoiler to tell you that only one of them, a security-officer cyborg named Morrow (Babou Ceesay), will survive to the second episode and that the ship itself will come crashing to Earth in New Siam, territory controlled by the Prodigy corporation and its bathrobe-wearing CEO, 22nd century tech dude Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), the \u201cyoungest trillionaire ever\u201d \u2014 just that description makes me want to see him eaten. (\u201cI don\u2019t know how things are done here in Bureaucracyville,\u201d he\u2019ll say in a meeting with rival corporate head Yutani, played by Sandra Yi Sencindiver, \u201cbut in the future, where I live, we move fast and we make trillions,\u201d and if that doesn\u2019t sound familiar, you\u2019re not listening hard enough to 2025.) The aliens, of course, will emerge intact to become the focus of industrial competition and skulduggery.\nAlan Tudyk scored his first starring role with \u2018Resident Alien,\u2019 but he\u2019s long been celebrated in genre circles, and for good reason.\nTo the usual agglomeration of humans, half-humans, humanoid robots and outer space beasts, \u201cAlien: Earth\u201d adds a new variety of beings, upon which it builds the series\u2019 central metaphor/literary reference: J.M. Barrie\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d not subtextual but explicit, spread all over the screen. In a brand new unexplained technology, Kavalier uploads the consciousness of terminally ill children into adult synthetic bodies, creating a human-robot hybrid. He seems to identify himself with Pan, whose narcissism he shares; he has named his secret \u201cresearch island\u201d Neverland, reads passages from Barrie\u2019s book and shows his young subjects a clip from the 1953 Disney film before their transfer. (The actual process is the work of a wife and husband team played by Essie Davis and David Rysdahl, who have differing ideas about family; it\u2019s a theme.)\nThe initial subjects are children because, says Marcy (Sydney Chandler, making a strong impression), our heroine and the first to go, because \u201cgrown-up minds are too stiff \u2014 they can\u2019t make the trip yet.\u201d To hammer home a point, she will become Wendy (because her new self \u201clooks like a Wendy\u201d), while the kids who follow her, and who are not nearly as smart, brave or competent as she, will be referred to as the Lost Boys (though there are girls among them) and given their names: Tootles (Kit Young), Nibs (Lily Newmark), Slightly (Adarsh Gourav), Curly (Erana James) and, stealing a moniker from Hook\u2019s crew, Smee (Jonathan Ajayi). Just why these particular kids have been chosen is not mentioned, possibly because there is no reason other than their individual usefulness to the plot, but the cognitive dissonance of being kids in grown-up bodies \u2014 often the stuff of comedy \u2014 is one of the more intriguing aspects of the series, if not as deeply explored as it might have been. But there are monsters fighting for screen time; they cause a lot of exciting havoc \u2014 and fair enough, they didn\u2019t ask to be kidnapped \u2014 but they\u2019re fairly one-note dramatically speaking.\nAs usually happens when robots or androids or other artificial people with personalities are in the picture, questions arise as to A) what makes a human and B) what\u2019s so great about being human, anyway, which form the emotional core of the series. (It does have one.) \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation,\u201d \u201cA.I.\u201d\u2014 it goes all the way back to Karel \u010capek\u2019s 1920 play \u201cR.U.R.,\u201d which I mention particularly for the fun fact that it is the source of the word \u201crobot,\u201d from the Czech \u201crobota,\u201d meaning \u201cforced labor,\u201d if you\u2019d care to think about that. (They kill all the humans.)\nNot even completing this cast of characters are Alex Lawther as Marcy/Wendy\u2019s brother Joe, an army medic with whom she will reunite, and Timothy Olyphant as Kirsh, a synthetic person who is her mentor, a cynical realist but not unkind, and the only funny character in the show; they have conflicting ideas about what\u2019s best for Wendy, who has her own ideas about that as well. Olyphant, who has dyed his hair and eyebrows white for the part, manages to be expressive while hardly changing his expression and funny without saying anything funny at all. Someone has to be."

      "text": "Thai cave rescue proves to be affecting drama in tension-filled \u2018Thirteen Lives\u2019\n- Share via\nAn extraordinary story of nerve-wracking heroism gets an appealingly straightforward, propulsive retelling in Ron Howard\u2019s \u201cThirteen Lives,\u201d which dutifully dramatizes the risky 2018 operation that saved a dozen boys and their soccer coach from the deepest recesses of the flooded Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Thailand.\nAs real-life cases of ticking-clock peril go, this one had everyone by the heart and throat as it unfolded, a monsoon season misadventure that spurred a remarkable coalition, locally and globally, of steadfast, industrious and ingenious souls: sacrificing farmers, rain diverters, Thai Navy SEALS and cave divers. Howard, comfortable with canvases big and small, knows from this kind of all-hands-on-deck story \u2014 its dramatic contours and gritty details \u2014 having made one of the great averting-disaster movies with \u201cApollo 13.\u201d\nFor your safety\nThe Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials.\nWhat\u2019s trickier, however, about getting \u201cThirteen Lives\u201d right is that a less conscientious filmmaker might have foregrounded a white-savior chronicle, considering the significant technical expertise of British divers Richard Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) and John Volanthen (Colin Farrell) and Australian anesthetist Richard Harris (Joel Edgerton), whose extraction method was, literally and figuratively, a shot in the dark.\nThe life-affirming reality of what transpired is, of course, a bigger narrative, and thankfully, Howard and screenwriter William Nicholson understand that. They\u2019ve smartly crafted a chronologically precise, wide-view version emphasizing the community of problem-solvers on hand \u2014 including a pressured Gov. Narongsak (Sahajak Boonthanakit), groundwater engineer Thanet Natisr (Nophand Boonyai), intrepid soldier Saman (Weir Sukollawat Kanarot), and literally thousands of helpers \u2014 whose efforts lay the groundwork for the success of a band of hobbyist explorers who happened to be white male foreigners.\nThere\u2019s a diversity of temperament too, when you factor in the nicked pride of Thai Navy SEAL leader Capt. Arnont Sureewong (Tui Thiraphat Sajakul) who must widen his notion of teamwork, and Mortensen\u2019s convincing portrayal of a cultural outsider whose irritableness when dealing with others is never terribly far from the surface. (Are we surprised a dude who chooses exploring remote, cramped underwater worlds as a leisure pursuit might prefer solitude to socializing?)\nHoward\u2019s version of this incredible story is also having to compete with the fact that it\u2019s not the only one made by an Oscar-winning filmmaker. \u201cThirteen Lives\u201d follows last year\u2019s documentary \u201cThe Rescue,\u201d from \u201cFree Solo\u201d directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, which was an illuminating, pulse-pounding knockout, built around key players\u2019 riveting first-person accounts (except, due to rights issues, that of the kids).\nInvariably, the carefully naturalistic approach that \u201cThirteen Lives\u201d takes keeps it from being as pointedly, emotionally walloping as \u201cThe Rescue.\u201d But what Howard does with his solid cast, steady pacing and seamless mix of location verisimilitude and Molly Hughes\u2019 cave-recreated production design is still plenty powerful whether you\u2019re familiar with the operation\u2019s details or not: he drops us right into a charged, time-sensitive atmosphere of hope and focus, and lets the unvarnished tension of a mission with no room for error play across everyone\u2019s faces as the story propels forward. On that visceral level too, it\u2019s possibly the wettest movie in recent memory, from first torrential downpour to last, with cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom\u2019s claustrophobic, lamplit cave tunnel sequences suitably thick with dank and darkness.\nHoward may never put his thumb on the scale to juice the emotions, but affecting moments of vulnerability still pierce the selflessness: the sense of guilt the boys\u2019 coach touchingly expresses, one mother\u2019s fear that her family\u2019s statelessness will be an issue and the reasonable worry across all the main players \u2014 especially when the daring rescue is set in motion \u2014 that\u2019s like a hot potato nobody wants to hold for too long.\nThere\u2019s even room for subtle spirituality in how the specifics of the boys\u2019 passage to safety relates to the mythical sleeping princess shown being prayed to by locals and believed to hold power over the mountain. \u201cThirteen Lives\u201d may be a vivid rescue procedural first and foremost, but it\u2019s also a testament to the guardian spirit possible in any of us.\n'Thirteen Lives'\nIn English and Thai with English subtitles\nRunning time: 2 hours, 27 minutes\nRated: PG-13, for some strong language and unsettling images\nPlaying: Starts July 29, AMC The Grove; available Aug. 5 on Amazon Prime Video"

      "text": "Joshua Rothkopf is film editor of the Los Angeles Times. He most recently served as senior movies editor at Entertainment Weekly. Before then, Rothkopf spent 16 years at Time Out New York, where he was film editor and senior film critic. His writing has appeared in the New York Times, Sight and Sound, Empire, Rolling Stone and In These Times, where he was chief film critic from 1999 to 2003.\n- Share via\n1\nGazing out of \u201cNapoleon\u201d (in wide release today) with sly, cat-eyed calculation, Vanessa Kirby turns the whole movie into a power game, one that eclipses the more brutal expressions of might on the battlefield. Of course, the epic contains cavalry campaigns at Austerlitz and Waterloo, a burning Moscow and an unfortunate Great Pyramid used for cannon target practice \u2014 it prints the facts and the legend both.\nBut take us back to Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s drawing room, where dom-versus-dom dynamics result in a showdown that could have filled several seasons of reality TV, with Kirby\u2019s purr often carrying the day. She gets the film\u2019s final word, haunting Napoleon from beyond the grave, just as she reportedly colonized his last gasp on his deathbed.\nKirby\u2019s Jos\u00e9phine joins the sisterhood of director Ridley Scott\u2019s women, characters marked by strength and savvy, overtly in \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d and \u201cG.I. Jane,\u201d but just as palpably in scene-stealing turns from Lorraine Bracco in 1987\u2019s \u201cSomeone to Watch Over Me,\u201d Jodie Comer in \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d and Lady Gaga in the deep-dish-of-crazy \u201cHouse of Gucci.\u201d Though his choice in scripts can sometimes be suspect, Scott may be the movies\u2019 most consistent stealth feminist.\n\u201cRipley was such a reference for me,\u201d Kirby says via video call of Scott\u2019s most iconic female creation, brought to life by Sigourney Weaver in the 1979 classic \u201cAlien.\u201d Clad in black and in a thoughtful mood, Kirby is game to indulge my pet theory \u2014 up to a point.\n\u201cThe film didn\u2019t signal endlessly that she was a woman,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was just a human. She happened to be female. And I think that, to me, is what radical female filmmaking should do. I would much rather it be less gendered. I want to play a human being that men can relate to because it\u2019s a human experience that she\u2019s going through, and that feels like the next frontier of filmmaking we need to get more of.\u201d\nAside from her mischievous flashes in the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d films, the Wimbledon-born Kirby, 35, is best known for her two-season turn as a decidedly human Princess Margaret in \u201cThe Crown,\u201d composed of equal parts flintiness and heartache. To Kirby, it\u2019s these \u201cmessy, contradictory, anti-heroine-type parts\u201d (she mentions Gena Rowlands\u2019 work with John Cassavetes) that inspire her. It\u2019s also what drew her to Jos\u00e9phine.\n\u201cThere must have been something inherently unknowable about her, something that he couldn\u2019t possess,\u201d Kirby offers as a window into Napoleon\u2019s obsession with the ex-courtesan (especially visible in Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s humorous take, bordering on adolescent frustration). \u201cHe could go and conquer all these lands but he couldn\u2019t hold her. She had to navigate an extremely difficult world to survive. And he could never own her.\u201d\nMuch of that enigmatic quality comes through in \u201cNapoleon\u2019s\u201d wordless passages, touching on Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s internal craftiness and then, later, her loneliness. These windswept moments are unlike any in Scott\u2019s career, suggestive of an entirely different Austen-like narrative unfolding off-camera. Scott, per his nature, has teased a director\u2019s cut, one that\u2019s an hour-and-a-half longer and Kirby-heavy.\n\u201cA brilliant listener,\u201d says Scott, 85, calling from London, of Kirby. \u201cI love Vanessa because the relationship, while never aggressive, is always fun. She\u2019s full of ideas, which I love.\u201d\nHe wouldn\u2019t call it coyness but rather a type of creativity. \u201cI\u2019m attracted to that kind of woman who says what she thinks,\u201d Scott says. For the record, he can roll with being called a feminist (\u201cabsolutely\u201d), which he tracks back to his mother, the \u201cdominating force\u201d in a domestic situation in which his father, a career military officer, was always away. \u201cHe was a sweetheart,\u201d Scott says. \u201cMy mum was always the boss.\u201d\nKirby, meanwhile, has her own reasons for those tip-lipped smiles.\n\u201cShe used to suck sugarcane as a child and lost most of her teeth,\u201d the actor says, relating an insight into the Caribbean-born Jos\u00e9phine that doesn\u2019t even get mentioned in the film. \u201cI mean, notoriously bad teeth, which meant that she never smiled with her teeth, but she was very playful by all accounts. So she did smile a lot. I actually wore a mouth guard with rotting teeth, but in the end, those scenes weren\u2019t in it.\u201d\nHer deep-dive prep into the voluminous scholarship on Jos\u00e9phine \u2014 much of which \u201cdidn\u2019t add up,\u201d in Kirby\u2019s view, a clue to her mercurial nature \u2014 came late during the pre-production after Comer left the role because of a scheduling conflict. (The 61-day shoot needed to move earlier.) Kirby seized on physicality to get to an interior place, an instinct that served her well during her early, celebrated years on stage doing Isben, Chekhov and even a Stella Kowalski in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d\nIt also suited Scott\u2019s shooting style: long takes, not a lot of notes, multiple cameras and a prankish sense of humor. Legendary for catching his actors off-guard since springing the famous \u201cchestbuster\u201d scene on an unknowing cast in \u201cAlien,\u201d Scott had a surprise in store for Kirby, aided by a playful Phoenix.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t tell her in that breakfast scene that he was going to say, \u2018I want to make a baby now,\u2019 and crawl down under the table,\u201d says Scott. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know that was going to happen. I said, \u2018Whatever happens, just keep going.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why I laughed!\u201d Kirby says, smiling at the memory. Another scene, one of the most mesmerizing in \u201cNapoleon,\u201d is a lengthy sofa snit-turned-seduction that she recalls was captured in nine-minute-long takes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, the amount we had to shoot,\u201d Kirby says. \u201cWe did everything in that scene. I mean, we were screaming at each other, we were kissing. There was so much in that scene, and I couldn\u2019t remember those nine minutes.\u201d\nKirby is just about to shoot \u201cEden,\u201d a Gal\u00e1pagos Islands-set survival thriller with Ana de Armas and Sydney Sweeney, directed by Ron Howard. Marvelites are pre-freaking out over rumors of her doing a Sue Storm in a new \u201cFantastic Four.\u201d (As if Kirby could ever play an invisible woman.) Bigness, you sense, is coming for her. It\u2019s a pivot her fans may want to stave off for a few more films. Unless, of course, she can reunite with Scott, who knows how to wear it lightly. \u201cI\u2019m asking him all the time,\u201d Kirby admits.\nFor now, though, there\u2019s the oasis she created with Phoenix, which sounds like the work she really wants to do. \u201cWe knew we had to create something that was unusual and not conventional because they weren\u2019t at all,\u201d Kirby says, noting that both Napoleon and Jos\u00e9phine were outsiders who rose and fell in Parisian society together.\n\u201cIt was almost like a recognition of: I see you, I know you,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wanted their first meeting to have that kind of strange knowingness between them that\u2019s almost incomparable: My essence understands yours in the most unlikely of ways. And we will always be drawn to each other.\u201d\nShe\u2019s articulate about how she does them, but there\u2019s a mystery to Kirby\u2019s best performances, an in-joke only she gets. Let\u2019s hope her Jos\u00e9phine sticks around for a while."

      "text": "- Share via\nWhen Jude Law and Justin Kurzel set out to make \u201cThe Order,\u201d a period piece about neo-Nazis in the Pacific Northwest, they couldn\u2019t have known that the events of the early 1980s would be as timely as they are today. Yes, groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers had been in the news from the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Va., through the Jan. 6 insurrection in 2021, but the idea of an energized white power movement with tacit presidential approval had faded \u2014 until Donald Trump was reelected.\n\u201cWe started developing the script, and then January 6 happened, and I\u2019m seeing nooses outside the Capitol building, and there were pictures of people holding \u2018The Turner Diaries,\u2019\u201d says director-producer Kurzel, referring to the 1978 novel that became a foundational text for white nationalists. \u201cAs we filmed and edited, and as the film played at festivals, it is interesting how it\u2019s sort of sharpened up in terms of how much it\u2019s speaking to the temperature at the moment.\u201d\nDuring the campaign, Trump himself vowed to fight what he calls \u201canti-white feeling\u201d in the U.S., and shortly after the election, the FBI said it was investigating threatening text messages sent to Black Americans, Latinos and people in the LGBTQ+ community around the country.\nBased on a true story, \u201cThe Order\u201d stars Law as Terry Husk, an FBI agent sent to Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, in 1983 to investigate a string of bank robberies. He soon discovers they\u2019re tied to a group called the Order, a splinter sect of the Aryan Nations led by Bob Mathews (Nicholas Hoult), a firebrand bent on a takeover of the U.S. government.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to say it didn\u2019t start with Bob Mathews,\u201d notes Law, who produced the film through his Riff Raff Entertainment banner. \u201cNor did it end with him. This is a social issue that\u2019s been going on for years and years and years. How do we deconstruct a world to stop it from happening? Is there a way? What does it take to defy them, to break them down? You can start with basic answers like education and employment. It usually starts with the blame game and one side having what others don\u2019t and who has more money.\u201d\nHusk is a composite of the many law enforcement officials who took part in the investigation, a fictional character with whom the filmmakers could paint a portrait that would dramatically contrast with the real-life Mathews.\n\u201cWe talked about damaging him and having him be under par,\u201d Law says about Husk\u2019s surgical scars, nosebleeds, prescription drugs and heavy drinking. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Mathews underestimate him. And to do that, I wanted him to be busted, like, \u2018Is this guy going to make it through the afternoon, let alone solve the case?\u2019\u201d\nAs Mathews, Hoult sports an unseemly Dutch-boy haircut masking steely determination. With leading-man good looks and sharp comedic timing, Hoult has only recently turned to his inner demons for inspiration, playing Lex Luthor in James Gunn\u2019s upcoming reimagined \u201cSuperman.\u201d As Mathews, he displays a charismatic pull that draws disaffected young men into the Order.\n\u201cWe understand the danger in him. But why is he surrounded by kids?\u201d wonders Kurzel. \u201cWhy is he surrounded by people that gravitate to him? Why is he having barbecues, what is that pull?\u201d\n\u2018What I enjoy doing is trying to disappear and not do the same thing over and over again,\u2019 says the actor with three recent releases: \u2018Juror #2,\u2019 \u2018The Order\u2019 and \u2018Nosferatu.\u2019\nIt\u2019s a question that resonates today as young men are increasingly drawn toward toxic male figures. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago [when] it was a heavily male-dominated society,\u201d says Law. \u201cWomen would probably say it still is, and it probably still is, unfairly, but it\u2019s left young men feeling vulnerable. And vulnerable minds and hearts and bodies are easy to prey on. We\u2019re driven by testosterone, which is easier to trigger. You set up a climate of haves and have-nots, and there\u2019s a natural male need to have and to provide.\u201d\nA two-time Oscar nominee (\u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley\u201d and \u201cCold Mountain\u201d), Law has several projects in the works: Upcoming films include \u201cEden,\u201d co-starring Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas and Sydney Sweeney, and he\u2019s currently in preproduction on Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d with Alicia Vikander, as well as \u201cSherlock Holmes 3,\u201d in which he\u2019ll reprise his role of Watson. He can be seen now in \u201cStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\u201d on Disney+, and next year in \u201cBlack Rabbit,\u201d a Netflix miniseries Riff Raff produced. It was through that project that he met \u201cThe Order\u201d screenwriter Zach Baylin and his wife, Kate Susman, who are its showrunners. (Kurzel directed two episodes of \u201cBlack Rabbit.\u201d)\n\u201cThe last couple of things I had that came out recently were delayed because of the [actors\u2019] strike,\u201d says Law about the sudden flurry of activity. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be asked to do some interesting work, and \u2018Black Rabbit\u2019 was something that came out of my production company. So I was excited to also be able to steer a piece I really believed in and wanted it to happen.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nGraciously illuminated by the midafternoon California sun, Ana de Armas tries to recall when or how she first became aware of Marilyn Monroe. The fast-rising star can\u2019t pinpoint when their paths first crossed.\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think I remember the first time I saw her,\u201d she said during a recent chat from her home in Los Angeles.\nIt may have been decades ago in Santa Cruz del Norte, Cuba \u2014 perhaps one of Monroe\u2019s movies played on a television screen that a young Ana Celia de Armas Caso glimpsed without yet registering her relevance.\nBut it\u2019s more likely, she believes, that she truly engaged with Monroe\u2019s indelible image only after leaving her Caribbean homeland for Spain at 18, when her world opened up to films previously inaccessible.\nAt once ever-present and elusive in our collective consciousness, Monroe remains an emblematic figure from a seemingly bygone Hollywood era \u2014 when exploitative industry practices prevailed unquestioned \u2014 and a pop culture mainstay since her untimely passing in 1962.\nHer troubled life story has inspired numerous scripted and nonfiction productions, including the 1996 HBO movie \u201cNorma Jean and Marilyn,\u201d Michelle Williams\u2019 Oscar-nominated turn in \u201cMy Week With Marilyn\u201d and Liz Garbus\u2019 2012 documentary \u201cLove, Marilyn.\u201d\nNow, De Armas, 34, adds to the canon as a fictionalized version of the \u201cSome Like It Hot\u201d star \u2014 and, more importantly, of the woman born Norma Jeane Mortenson \u2014 in director Andrew Dominik\u2019s \u201cBlonde,\u201d adapted from Joyce Carol Oates\u2019 1999 novel.\nFilmed over nine weeks in 2019 and then delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 as well as a reportedly contentious back-and-forth between Dominik and Netflix as the filmmaker stayed resolute on his vision for the film\u2019s length and substance \u2014 \u201cBlonde\u201d has its long-awaited bow next week in competition at the Venice Film Festival.\nThe film then hits select theaters Sept. 16 and launches Sept. 28 on Netflix. It will become one of the streaming giant\u2019s few NC-17 rated offerings, a label attributed to \u201csome sexual content\u201d and one reason it has stirred significant online chatter about its depiction of traumatic events. So far, most of the talk has come from those who have not seen any footage beyond promotional material.\nOver the course of its nearly three-hour runtime of fluid and cinematically imaginative vignettes, \u201cBlonde\u201d chronicles Monroe\u2019s abandonment issues, her mother\u2019s mental illness, a sexual assault, a series of volatile relationships, her loss of agency \u2014 both of her body and her career \u2014 and the expectations she endured from the studio, the men who circled her, and the public at large; all to denounce how Norma Jeane\u2019s personhood was commodified and her pain ignored.\nFor De Armas, earning the role of an American icon seemed nearly unfathomable.\n\u201cOn paper I was not supposed to be playing Marilyn Monroe. I\u2019m a Cuban actress. In what world could I have imagined that this was going to happen? Never,\u201d De Armas said, still somewhat incredulous. \u201cThe fact that I got this opportunity was just something out of the ordinary.\u201d\nThe Oscars are seven months away but it\u2019s not too early to take stock of the fall\u2019s early arriving contenders.\nDominik first witnessed De Armas\u2019 onscreen allure in Eli Roth\u2019s 2015 home-invasion horror flick \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d where she played a murderous visitor opposite Keanu Reeves. It was then that he noticed both her physical resemblance to Monroe and the je ne sais quoi of her screen presence.\nDuring the audition process, De Armas chose to approach the role as not a venerated legend but rather a relatable person undergoing extraordinary situations with familiar emotions.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re talking about Marilyn, a famous actress, or not, she\u2019s still a woman,\u201d said De Armas. \u201cAnd I knew I could understand that part at least.\u201d\n\u201cWhen she read for it, you could feel her \u2014 the world revolved around her onscreen,\u201d Dominik recalled via email. \u201cThe film didn\u2019t really come to life until Ana appeared.\u201d\nOnce officially cast, De Armas began preparing for \u201cBlonde\u201d while still shooting the darkly comedic mystery \u201cKnives Out\u201d for writer-director Rian Johnson. In the eventual sleeper hit, De Armas\u2019 Marta is a quiet Latina nurse working for a wealthy family who unexpectedly finds herself at the center of a whodunit and a fierce battle for a sizable inheritance. It was the film that would elevate her status in Hollywood beyond supporting roles.\n\u201cPart of the reason you are rooting for the character throughout is because Ana doesn\u2019t play Marta as a shrinking violet or as somebody who is going to step away. She plays her as someone very much going to go toe-to-toe with the family holding her own,\u201d noted Johnson. \u201cShe made the movie work.\u201d\nWhile tackling 12-hour days on the set of \u201cKnives Out,\u201d De Armas would still find the time and energy to Zoom three hours a day with her \u201cBlonde\u201d vocal coach. That unwavering commitment resulted in a detailed examination of Monroe\u2019s speech.\n\u201cIt was about observing her facial expressions, her mouth, the roundedness of her lips, how she showed her lower teeth, and why the \u2018o\u2019s were like that,\u201d explained De Armas. \u201cSomeone\u2019s voice is more than just a specific accent. It says so much more about a person.\u201d\nDominik points out that Monroe\u2019s onscreen voice changed over the years depending on who was coaching her. There was a period under coach Natasha Lytess when Monroe would over-emphasize every consonant; then, in the mid 1950s, she transitioned into a baby-like tone, and later into a more naturalistic delivery under mentor Lee Strasberg.\nYet, the voice that most concerned Dominik, and in turn De Armas, was Monroe\u2019s offscreen persona. Dominik cites an interview with Life magazine associate editor Richard Meryman, where Monroe appeared \u201cdrunk and quite shrill and brassy,\u201d as one of the few references to her \u201ctrue\u201d sound.\nDe Armas came to believe Monroe\u2019s affectations were manifestations of her unmet emotional needs and distress, but the vocal range was only one aspect of her task. She was after a more meaningful pursuit: getting to know Norma Jeane.\n\u201cTo me, it was more important to understand where she was at emotionally every time, with every line, what was she thinking, what was she feeling, more than anything else,\u201d said De Armas. \u201cThat was my goal, to understand.\u201d\nAsked if he had any apprehension in casting De Armas given her own inherent accent as someone for whom English is a recently learned second language, Dominik said: \u201cI had concerns, until I saw her act, then I forgot what I was supposed to be concerned about.\n\u201cWe felt that we were dealing with Norma Jeane and Norma should sound less like a cartoon of Marilyn Monroe,\u201d he added. \u201cAna spent a year listening to all the Marilyns and arrived to something which felt real.\u201d\nAs part of her research, De Armas learned that Monroe took personal speech classes and felt rather insecure about how her voice influenced perceptions of her and her work. Without putting nearly as much pressure on herself as Monroe did, De Armas said she relates to the desire to improve and to be seen as a multilayered artist.\n\u201cShe associated that with being taken seriously. She struggled with that her entire life,\u201d she said. \u201cShe wanted to be considered a serious actress. But that\u2019s not what people asked of her.\u201d\nThe cornerstone of De Armas\u2019 performance, and of the film\u2019s ethos, is the marked separation between Norma Jeane and Marilyn Monroe. De Armas\u2019 job was to take on a character, Norma, who at times plays Monroe.\n\u201cShe would talk about Marilyn as if it was someone else, something that she didn\u2019t prepare for. It just happened to her,\u201d De Armas said. \u201cBut she had to carry on with it. And it was a love-hate relationship that she had with Marilyn. She couldn\u2019t stand being this image and what was expected from her anymore, at the same time it was what she needed to survive.\u201d\nEarly on, De Armas instinctively reacted with defensiveness and rage in scenes depicting the many injustices and abuses committed against Norma, until one specific instruction from Dominik helped her comprehend how Norma walked through the world.\n\u201cAndrew told me, \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to ever express anger \u2014 that is not in her survival kit. She cannot afford that. You have to find other ways to get out of the situation, other ways to survive,\u2019\u201d De Armas recalled. \u201cHow do you navigate a normal life, let alone being her and living in that world, without being able to express anger or have boundaries?\u201d\nDe Armas had to grapple with how Norma used a demeanor of defenselessness as a defense mechanism. Since she couldn\u2019t fight back against the male-dominated systems that controlled her existence, she relied on finding protectors to rescue her. That in turn guided her physicality and how she interacted with the world.\n\u201cEverything in the way she moved, the way she spoke, her tone, her breathiness, her facial expressions, her lips and her sensuality, it was all connected to her emotions,\u201d said De Armas. \u201cIt was not a calculated thing. When you don\u2019t have the support that you need around you, when you\u2019re alone, completely alone, what do you do? Well, the best you can.\u201d\nHarry Styles is ready for his big screen breakthrough but he\u2019s not the only actor set to make a big impact this fall.\nAs De Armas worked to nail the interior of her character, a similar effort went into re-creating her exterior appearance. Concerned that simply mimicking Monroe\u2019s makeup on De Armas wouldn\u2019t produce the desired results, Dominik\u2019s direction to the hair and makeup team was, \u201cYou cannot do Marilyn\u2019s makeup on Ana. You have to make Ana look like Marilyn.\u201d No prosthetics were employed, only subtle touches to capture Monroe\u2019s most essential features.\n\u201cAna De Armas seems to have captured the quicksilver commingling of emotions that characterized Marilyn Monroe \u2014 an air of childlike expectation and yearning,\u201d said Oates via email, offering high praise for her turn. \u201cNo one of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s numerous imitators \u2014 like Jayne Mansfield\u2014 came close to capturing her vulnerability as Ana de Armas has.\u201d\nCo-star Bobby Cannavale, whose character is inspired by Monroe\u2019s short-time husband and baseball player Joe DiMaggio, met De Armas for the first time while she was in full costume, right before shooting one of their intense scenes together.\n\u201cThe physical transformation was astonishing, but the fragility with which she walked through the room, and her attempt to put on a kind of armor while maintaining that fragility, was really striking to me,\u201d Cannavale said by phone. \u201cWhatever it was that she was emanating, it very strongly came through.\u201d\nOne of Cannavale\u2019s scenes with De Armas features an act of physical violence \u2014 which, according to Dominik, was executed with strict boundaries discussed prior to the shooting. It\u2019s one of a handful of mostly implied moments where the heroine endures abusive behavior from men, and despite some concerns already expressed by Monroe fans that the film will exploit what the actor went through, both the star and auteur of \u201cBlonde\u201d stand by their intent.\n\u201cWe made a movie about Norma Jeane. Otherwise, Norma would\u2019ve remained invisible. We\u2019re talking about the opposite of Marilyn Monroe. We\u2019re talking about humanizing this person who hasn\u2019t been seen and who was going through all of this, and she didn\u2019t have anybody there for her to help her who didn\u2019t have an agenda or didn\u2019t need something from her,\u201d said De Armas. \u201cMy hope is that people feel more respect for her now that they can know her struggles and what she went through.\u201d\n\u201cDepicting traumatic events is the opposite of exploitation,\u201d added Dominik. \u201cShowing a glamorous surface without acknowledging trauma is the very definition of exploitation.\u201d\nIn addition to the private turmoil she experienced, Monroe was the victim of public scrutiny. Every element of her life seemed up for grabs for the era\u2019s tabloids. Today, De Armas empathizes with the feeling of violation that comes from having her intimacy exposed, as she experienced in her romantic relationship with actor Ben Affleck.\nFall arts and entertainment picks from music, books, TV, arts and movies.\nThough she was never naive about the side effects of notable fame, De Armas said that making \u201cBlonde\u201d reinforced her ferocious stance on protecting her privacy at all costs. She confessed that while she has an Instagram account, she often questions its use and value.\n\u201cNowadays the studios might not own actors, but the media does, and it\u2019s pretty sad and very scary. I try as much as I can to not be a part of that and to live the life that I want to live and share what I want to share,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s not always in my control and it\u2019s just the world that we\u2019re living in now.\u201d\nDe Armas, certain that most days she still speaks more Spanish than English when not doing interviews, explains that the difference is that unlike Norma Jeane, she has people around her who prevent her from ever dwelling on navel-gazing thoughts or frustration.\n\u201cYou know what it\u2019s like, you always get on the phone with your people. You always hear about what I call \u2018real-life problems.\u2019 There\u2019s no way for me to not be connected to that because it\u2019s my daily life. They\u2019re here all the time,\u201d she said, holding up her cellphone, the vehicle that preserves her bonds across the globe in Cuba, Spain and Los Angeles.\n\u201cI feel like my essence is still where it\u2019s supposed to be. It\u2019s still there, full on, untouched. I feel pretty grounded,\u201d said De Armas. \u201cSometimes I have to do things for my job like going on a press tour and promote movies and do red carpets. It\u2019s part of the job, but I want to keep those reminders of who I am close to me.\u201d\nGiven that the journey for \u201cBlonde\u201d to reach the screen started several years ago, De Armas has let go of the initial pressure she felt about playing Monroe. She trusts her work and says she\u2019s not worried about audience reception. That the film exists, and she defied the odds to be a part of it, is enough.\n\u201cWhatever happens with the movie, it doesn\u2019t matter. It matters that we told a story that we believed in. It matters that I played a character that I was not supposed to play, that I challenged myself, that I grew as an actress and as a person,\u201d said De Armas. \u201cThat\u2019s what I take with me.\u201d\nOn the other side of the most demanding feat of her flourishing career, De Armas reflected on how Hollywood represents \u2014 or, more consistently, misrepresents \u2014 the many groups that comprise the diverse Latino ethnicity, often reducing specific experiences to broad generalizations.\n\u201cAbout the opportunities that are out there today for us Latinos, I can tell you from my perspective, they\u2019re not enough,\u201d De Armas said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t feel like the parts that are there very well capture our essence, who we are, our communities, what we like, how we do things and our stories.\u201d\nWith that in mind, De Armas still cherishes the three films she made as a teenage theater student in her native Cuba before migrating to Europe: \u201cUna rosa de Francia,\u201d \u201cMadrigal\u201d and \u201cEl ed\u00e9n perdido.\u201d These early opportunities provided her with a foundation and a hands-on education that defined the actor she would become.\n\u201cThose movies, they meant everything to me. They were the confirmation that this is what I want to do, these are the people I want to be with. This is where I\u2019m the happiest. This is where I feel the most creative,\u201d De Armas said. \u201cThey were so much fun without me even understanding yet what making a movie was.\u201d\nVisibly emotional, De Armas recalled a recent Facebook post from one of her former classmates in Cuba, who shared a photo with memories of their younger days and congratulations on her accomplishments.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when you realize that the opportunity is for you, but it\u2019s bigger than you. It reflects on your people. It shows them that the impossible is possible. Whether it\u2019s my former classmate or the new kids in the first grade of drama school, they can now believe they can get roles like Marilyn Monroe,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I did it. Maybe subconsciously I didn\u2019t know people would feel that way about me taking this on, but deep inside, I did it for them.\u201d\nThe 2021-22 Oscar season ended in disaster; the summer was a mixed bag. As the industry shakes off COVID\u2019s effects, our critic urges caution \u2014 and optimism."
