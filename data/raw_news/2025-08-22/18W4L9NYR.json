      "text": "Nvidia reportedly orders halt to H20 production amid Chinese scrutiny, shares slip\n- Tesla stock has had a rollercoaster year.\n- Musk\u2019s brief stint in the U.S. government and disappointing earnings weighed heavily on the shares.\n- Is the recent pullback in Tesla a buying opportunity?\n- Find undervalued opportunities across global markets for less than $9 a month with InvestingPro.\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have been on a turbulent ride since the start of the year. The stock spent roughly the first four months in a downtrend before finding a floor in April, followed by a modest rebound that quickly ran out of steam.\nSince May, Tesla has mostly traded sideways, hovering around a pivot point near $320. As of Monday\u2019s close at $339.03, the stock was still down 16% year-to-date.\nPlenty of Reasons to Be Cautious on Tesla in 2025\nInvestors have had no shortage of reasons to tread carefully with Tesla this year. The steep decline in the early months of 2025 was largely triggered by Elon Musk\u2019s entry into the Trump administration.\nHis new government role pulled him away from Tesla, with the CEO reportedly spending only a fraction of his time managing the EV maker\u2014a concern that rattled shareholders.\nMoreover, some of Musk\u2019s highly polarizing stances in his official capacity took a toll on Tesla\u2019s brand image. Reports emerged of vandalized Teslas, and sales took a noticeable hit.\nAware of the damage to Tesla and under shareholder pressure, Musk began distancing himself from his government duties in April and officially stepped down at the end of May. However, this was not enough to spark a meaningful recovery in the stock.\nTo make matters worse, Musk\u2019s divided attention wasn\u2019t the only drag this year. Earnings have been far from stellar. Tesla\u2019s Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 results, released on January 29 and April 23, disappointed on both profit and sales.\nThe Q2 2025 numbers, published last month, met expectations but still showed a 23% year-over-year drop in EPS and a nearly 12% decline in revenue.\nThe Simpler Explanation: Tesla Was Overvalued\nBeyond these headlines, there may be a more straightforward explanation for Tesla\u2019s performance in 2025\u2014it was simply overvalued.\nOur Fair Value model\u2014an aggregate of up to 17 respected valuation methods\u2014flagged this as early as December 2024, before Donald Trump even took office. At that time, Tesla was overvalued by more than 30%.\nOn December 18, 2024, with Tesla trading near record highs at around $465, the InvestingPro Fair Value estimate pointed to a potential 33.54% downside.\nIn other words, Fair Value was warning that Tesla\u2019s price had far overshot its fundamental worth. Sure enough, the stock began to slide, recording a drop of more than\u2014you guessed it\u201430% from that December alert.\n- Already an InvestingPro member? Then check out which stocks are the most overvalued in the market right now.\nIf not, then here\u2019s your chance to subscribe for half the price as part of our summer sale. This means you can access the list of picks for less than $9 a month for a limited time only.\nHow Much Is the EV Giant Really Worth Now?\nToday, with shares back at $339.03 and the latest Fair Value estimate for Tesla at $256.83, the stock still appears overvalued by more than 24%.\nSource: InvestingPro\nThis suggests that Tesla\u2019s troubles may not be over, and it\u2019s still too soon\u2014at least from a fundamental perspective\u2014to bet on a sustained rebound.\nHow to Spot the Best Undervalued Stocks with Fair Value\nFor investors hunting for the next big opportunities, there are plenty of undervalued stocks to choose from right now.\nThe Investing.com screener currently identifies 258 U.S. stocks with an upside potential of over 50%, according to the InvestingPro Fair Value model.\n- Are you an InvestingPro (Pro+ plan) member? Discover these 258 stocks on the screener by clicking here.\nIn addition to the screener, the Undervalued Stocks page on Investing.com features a constantly updated list of stocks flagged by InvestingPro Fair Value as having significant upside, along with solid financial health.\nRight now, that page highlights 10 U.S. stocks with more than 30% upside potential and strong balance sheets.\nNote: This list is available exclusively to InvestingPro members.\nBottom Line\nInvestingPro Fair Value could have helped many investors sidestep Tesla\u2019s slide this year\u2014not through any magic formula, but by providing a practical way to assess whether a stock is over or undervalued using respected financial models.\nBeyond helping investors know when to take profits (or which stocks to avoid), Fair Value is also a powerful tool for spotting undervalued stocks that could turn into strong buying opportunities."

Meanwhile, Tesla's stock has faced significant challenges this year, attributed to Elon Musk's government role and disappointing earnings, leading to a valuation that still appears overvalued by more than 24%.",
