  "content": "Maura Higgins has given fans a sneak peek inside her plush \u00a31.25million Essex mansion - unveiling a dramatic living room transformation.\n\nThe Love Island favourite, 34, shared a before-and-after look with her 3.7million Instagram followers on Monday on her new home Instagram account.\n\nMaura showed how the once sparse space, pictured with just two slouchy white beanbags and a boxed-up TV, has been completely transformed into a snug lounge.\n\nGone were the empty walls and floors and in their place, a plush white and cream sofa, a matching ottoman, soft rugs, candles and warm lighting.\n\nThe Irish beauty, who first shot to fame in 2019, has finally fulfilled her dream of upgrading from her modest one-bed flat to a five-bedroom home.\n\nThe upgrade comes after Maura's meteoric rise to fame, from her breakout stint on Love Island to presenting Love Island USA, starring in I'm A Celebrity, and bagging her latest role in The Traitors US.\n\nSpeaking about her ambitions, Maura previously said she always knew she wasn't destined to stay in rural County Longford, marry her teenage boyfriend and open a hair salon. 'That wasn't my dream, I wanted more,' she once declared.\n\nEarlier this year, she splashed her hard-earned \u00a33.2million fortune on the luxury pad, which boasts an en-suite master bedroom, four further bedrooms, an expansive kitchen with an island, and black French doors leading to a landscaped garden.\n\nOverjoyed, Maura shared to her Instagram followers a picture of her new kitchen with a chandelier and grey floors, which she bought in October, with the caption 'Bought my dream house'.\n\nMaura's previous home was raided by three-masked men and so the Love Island star has ensured her new home was in a gated development which provides privacy and security.\n\nAfter first sharing the news of her new home in October, Maura had barely gotten the keys to her new house when she entered the jungle in November for a four-week stint in Australia.\n\nMaura entered the Love Island villa in 2019 and after almost six years in the spotlight with lucrative brand deals, she has amassed a fortune of an estimated \u00a33.2million.\n\nMaura recently shared how she escaped working in a hair salon in Ireland to become a ring girl for the brand Monster against the wishes of her then-boyfriend and dad.\n\nThe influencer said: 'I wanted to do more and travel the world. I'm young, why not?'\n\nHer time with Monster caught the eye of ITV recruiters for Love Island, who approached Maura multiple times before she finally accepted as revenge against her boyfriend, which has now landed her a multi-million-pound fortune.\n\nHer big home purchase came after she treated herself to a new \u00a360,000 Porsche just before heading into the I'm A Celebrity jungle in November.\n\nMaura became the proud owner of a Porsche Macan, which typically ranges in price from \u00a360,000 to \u00a398,00.\n\nSharing a photo from inside her new car, she showed off its luxurious all-white leather interior.\n\nMaura captioned the post: 'My baby has arrived finally,' along with a white heart emoji.\n\nIt comes after Maura displayed her toned physique in a summer minidress on the weekend as she shared a glimpse of her lavish lifestyle in an Instagram post.\n\nThe former Love Island star, 34, stunned as she enjoyed a picnic in the sun while wearing an ivory and pink milkmaids dress.\n\nIn a second image she looked happier than ever after pulling on a pair of thigh-skimming shorts and fedora hat for a bike ride.\n\nAnother snap captures Maura enjoying a mint ice cream, while wearing a ruffled dress in a similar colour.\n\nShe also shared a glimpse of herself in more casual attire, including a bright pink T-shirt dress branded with the Love Island logo.\n\nThe brunette later posed for a fun snap with her pals as they made funny faces for a photo collage.",

Love Island viewers took to Twitter on Monday night to criticise Maura for blasting her friend Elma over breaking girl code by expressing an interest in new boy Tom - despite having done the same to Mollie-Mae over Tommy\n'I wouldn't do it to any of the other girls. I wouldn't do it!', the brunette beauty lamented to an amused Mollie-Mae, who remained tight-lipped on the matter.\nViewers took to Twitter in their droves to point out how ridiculous her allegations were.\nOne tweeted: 'Watching Maura have the AUDACITY to moan about Elma after her own recent behaviour #loveisland'.\nAnother posted: 'How can Maura sit there 'raging' cos the only other guy interested in her is interested in Elma too...'I would never steal a guy off a friend I'm a girls girl' Hun what did you do when you walked in there...!! #DoubleStandards #lovelsland'.\nDrama: She was seen moaning about her close pal Elma expressing an interest in new boy Tom (pictured together), despite her being coupled up with Anton\nFan reaction: Amused viewers couldn't believe the 'audacity' Maura showed by complaining\nA third amused fan shared a meme of a smug rabbit, writing, 'my face if I was #MollyMae when #Maura started ranting about ##Elma #lovelsland'.\nDuring the latest episode, Maura was seen shooting daggers at Elma when she confessed to the girls in the dressing room that she was open to getting to know model Tom.\nMaura took Lucie aside to rage at her co-star's comments.\nUpset: Maura declared she was 'f***ing raging' when Elma showed interest in newcomer Tom\nShe said: 'What f***ing annoys me the most is that she's coupled up with Anton, she has the chance. I'm not coupled up with anyone! I haven't had the chance to couple up with anyone.\n'She's supposed to be my f***ing friend, and now am I going to have to fight for him as well? Talk about destroying my confidence!'\nMaura continued her rant later in the Beach Hut, where she declared: 'I'm f***ing raging'.\nGoing on a rant: Maura took Lucie aside to rage at her co-star's comments\nMaura's outburst comes as Ofcom has received around 500 complaints about her 'predatory' behaviour towards boxer Tommy Fury - in just two days.\nThe media watchdog has received 794 complaints since Friday alone, 486 of which relate to Maura's actions as she attempted to plant a kiss on Tommy while lying on top of him which many viewers branded 'desperate' and 'crossing a line' on Twitter.\nOn Friday viewers saw Maura climb on top of Tommy and try and kiss him, despite him rebuffing her advances out of respect for partner Mollie.\nComplaints: Since Friday the watchdog received a total of 794 complaints, 486 of which were related to Maura's display with Tommy Fury, which many viewers branded 'desperate' and 'crossing a line'\nThe undeterred model later stared directly into his eyes and asked him if she 'turned him on', and later suggestively sucked on a popsicle while gazing into his eyes.\nWhen contacted by MailOnline a spokesperson for Love Island said: 'We take the emotional well-being of all the Islanders extremely seriously.\n'We have dedicated welfare producers and psychological support on hand at all times who monitor and regularly speak to all of the Islanders in private and off camera, especially if someone appears to be upset.\n'All the Islanders are therefore fully supported by the professionals on site and by their friends in the villa. This means Islanders are always able to reach out and talk to someone if they feel the need.\n'We will of course continue to monitor all of our Islanders in line with our robust protocols. Love Island holds a mirror up to relationships and all the different dynamics that go with them.'\nA source close to Joe added: 'Joe is a great guy and you can tell how much he genuinely likes Lucie. Any suggestion online that he has been ''gaslighting'' is unfair, you can see he only wants the best for Lucie and their time together in Love Island.\"\nA representative for Ofcom said: 'We will assess these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'\nOfcom holds the power to fine broadcasters who breach its rules and say the fine is dependent on the size and turnover of the firm - fines can reach an upper limit of 10% of the broadcaster's turnover.\nITV was issued the largest fine of any broadcaster in 2008 when Ofcom charged them \u00a35.68m for their abuse of premium phone lines on shows including Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Ant and Dec's Gameshow Marathon.\nCompetition: Tom, who entered the villa with Jordan, admitted to liking both Maura and Elma when the group were chatting around the fire pit in a new clip\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Biblical flooding hits Wisconsin leaving residents trapped in homes\n- Moment 'dine and dashers' run out on \u00a3200 bill at Indian restaurant\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground"
