      "feedback": "The draft touches all four themes, but its 0–3 week framing is too diffuse and the causal chain isn’t tight or quantified enough to support tactical reads; to upgrade to world‑class, rewrite as a single, tight horizon note with a three‑lane causal spine (Beasley/cap-space dynamics; Shopify earnings and forward guidance; geopolitical risk/off‑wall sentiment) and explicit triggers, invalidations, and monitoring levels. Concrete edits: 1) structure the piece around a crisp base case and two near‑term catalysts, then a short risk overlay, with each node anchored to verifiable numbers and dates (Beasley: Detroit’s non‑tax MLE is exhausted by LeVert; Beasley max re‑sign under non‑Bird rights is $7.2m this year; Pistons pivoted to LeVert for $28.9m over two years; Nets/Wizards/Bulls/Kings cap-room potential remain—XB5ZRN1VP; NBX9RA9WX). 2) quantify cap mechanics and thresholds: cite Nets cap space (>$20m) and the remaining non‑tax MLE around $14.1m for many teams from Spotrac’s signing‑exception data (Spotrac NBA Signing Exceptions) to bound outbid potential and timing (Spotrac 6); tie Beasley’s value ceiling to Early Bird/non‑Bird scenarios (XB5ZRN1VP) and a clear invalidation if Beasley remains in Detroit only on a short one‑year deal versus a bid‑heavy market. 3) sharpen Shopify: lock in the Q2 facts (GMV ~$163B, revenue ~$5B in H1 2025; growth mid/high‑20s; P/E ~70, P/S ~18) and translate them into a near‑term reaction function: if Q3 guidance maintains mid‑to‑high‑20s revenue growth and improving margins, expect continued upside; if guidance softens or margins compress, anticipate 10–20% near‑term multiple compression (QGXA2WQJ3; 19NO2GMNF). 4) trim peripheral risk voices and keep the focus on near‑term catalysts; the BigBear.ai piece (OB27SL8WU) can be mentioned as a cautionary AI‑hype proxy but avoid conflating its insolvency risk with the Beasley/Shopify narrative, since the time horizon is 0–3 weeks. 5) consolidate the risk‑off channel: the Moscow gas‑cylinder blast (NBX9RA9WX) as a geopolitical risk overlay that could magnify risk‑off flows if sentiment deteriorates, but treat it as a backdrop rather than a dominant driver unless there’s an immediate escalation. 6) make the monitoring list explicit and threshold‑driven: Shopify Q3 guidance and real‑time GMV signals; Beasley probe status and in‑market cap space movements; in‑market cap‑sensitivity and any in‑season cap â€”trade‑exception activity; and any spillover from Moscow into risk premia. 7) fix citation hygiene and consistency: attach each clause to the exact IDs (XB5ZRN1VP and NBX9RA9WX for Beasley/cap, QGXA2WQJ3 and 19NO2GMNF for Shopify, OB27SL8WU for BigBear.ai, NBX9RA9WX again for the Moscow update) and avoid duplicative or irrelevant sources (RealGM/ESPN pieces can be cited only where they carry distinct, decision‑relevant facts). 8) deliver a tight, single‑paragraph read with explicit “watch levels” and an invalidation line (e.g., if Beasley reopens negotiations at a higher start, or Shopify guides to a sub‑mid‑20s growth, or the Moscow event escalates beyond a risk‑off impulse). This will yield a world‑class, decision‑oriented 0–3 week view that stacks concrete numbers against clear catalysts and invalidation points.",
