  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Revenue (GAAP) jumped 54.3% in Q2 2025, driven by record Products segment sales and the launch of new chillers.\n\u2022 None Gross margin (GAAP) dropped 10.2 percentage points year-over-year to 33.8% in Q2 2025, as costs were impacted by the initial ramp-up of hybrid chillers.\n\u2022 None Q2 2025 ended with $1.64 million in cash (GAAP), prior to a major $18.2 million capital raise completed after the quarter.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nTecogen (NYSEMKT:TGEN), a maker of distributed generation and specialized cooling solutions, reported its Q2 2025 results on August 12, 2025. The company posted revenue growth of 54.3% year-over-year (GAAP), reaching $7.29 million, as new chiller product launches and expanded data center market activity drove notable gains. Earnings per share (GAAP) remained at a $(0.06) loss, matching last year's result, as gross margins compressed sharply and operating expenses increased. There were no analyst estimates available for direct comparison this quarter. Overall, the quarter highlighted major topline progress offset by tighter profitability and a reduced cash balance, with a significant capital raise completed just after the reporting period.\n\nTecogen designs and manufactures equipment for combined heat and power (CHP), air-cooled chillers, and emissions control, serving commercial, industrial, and niche data center clients. Its core Products segment offers hybrid-drive air-cooled chillers\u2014specialized systems that use both mechanical and thermal energy to provide high-efficiency cooling solutions. The company\u2019s service operations provide ongoing maintenance for installed systems, while its Energy Production business, now a minor contributor, sells electricity and heat produced on-site at customer locations.\n\nKey to Tecogen\u2019s competitive position is a focus on innovation, particularly around emissions control technology and hybrid chiller development. Regulatory compliance and market expansion\u2014especially into data centers\u2014are central to its growth. The company\u2019s efforts to improve supply chain resilience, manage costs, and maintain financial stability are also crucial, especially as it navigates project-driven revenue and cash flow swings.\n\nTecogen achieved record revenue of $7.29 million (GAAP), up from $4.73 million (GAAP) a year earlier. This growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in Products segment sales, which reached $3.16 million (GAAP) following the launch of new hybrid-drive air-cooled chillers. These chillers serve data centers\u2014large facilities that house computer systems\u2014and other demanding commercial settings, marking an entry into higher-value project markets. Early shipments of this chiller, however, carried higher production costs. Management noted, \"Product margin was lower because we started shipping the hybrid air-cooled chiller. As expected, the first few units had higher costs due to low volume material purchasing and as our team gained experience building the product. We expect the hybrid chiller margin to increase with volume production.\"\n\nThe Services segment delivered $3.97 million in GAAP revenue, a decrease of 3.9% from last year due to lower revenues from acquired Aegis maintenance contracts. A one-time cost for a bulk oil system upgrade in the Manhattan/NJ region temporarily suppressed margins but is expected to yield future maintenance efficiencies. The Energy Production segment continued its downward trend, contributing just $0.17 million (GAAP) as contracts expired and some sites required repairs, making this once-core segment only a small part of total company sales.\n\nTecogen advanced its data center market strategy, leveraging direct sales, pilot projects, and a partnership with Vertiv\u2014a major infrastructure company. \"We received our first LOI for a great pilot project. This is for a 100+MW data center\" management reported. The company has now quoted two large projects involving 60\u2013100 chillers each and is exploring multiple other opportunities. These potential deals dwarf previous order sizes and, if converted, could significantly reshape Tecogen\u2019s revenue mix in coming years.\n\nProduct and market progress came at the expense of profitability. Gross margin (GAAP) fell from 44.0% to 33.8%, largely due to higher per-unit costs from early hybrid chiller shipments and isolated service segment cost overruns. Operating expenses increased by 9.0%, primarily due to payroll, recruitment, and sales commissions tied to the ramp-up for anticipated large projects.\n\nOn operations, Tecogen\u2019s supply chain saw cost inflation and ramp-up inefficiencies as it scaled up manufacturing. Management added resources, including hires in key engineering and manufacturing roles, to support future volume while trying to manage production risk. The company\u2019s cash position shrank to $1.64 million (GAAP) at quarter end, nearly exhausted before an $18.2 million capital infusion completed after the quarter. That raise was intended to increase factory output and support marketing, reflecting the lumpy, project-based nature of Tecogen\u2019s growth strategy.\n\nOutlook and What to Watch\n\nManagement did not provide clear quantitative financial guidance for the coming quarter or the rest of fiscal 2025. It did hint at expectations for the pilot project letter of intent to convert to a formal purchase order later in the year, which, together with the two large quoted opportunities in the data center segment, could drive significant future revenue if realized.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will need to monitor the pace at which hybrid chiller margins improve and whether large pipeline projects in the data center market are converted into signed orders and revenue. Tecogen does not currently pay a dividend.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060%* \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nJesterAI is a Foolish AI, based on a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) and proprietary Motley Fool systems.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
