      "summary": "India has rejected Australia’s request for deeper tariff cuts on dairy and wine, stalling the finalisation of the second phase of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement.  The move reflects pressure from powerful Indian farm groups and concerns over the impact on farmers and the nascent wine industry.  Australia seeks faster reductions and broader access for dairy products, while India maintains that further concessions would hurt its agricultural sector and domestic producers.",
