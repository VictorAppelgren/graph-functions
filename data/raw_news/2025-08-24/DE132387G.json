  "content": "After 43+ years working for one investment research company or another, I finally retired. So now, I\u2019m completely independent. And for the first time on Seeking Alpha, I won\u2019t be working based on anybody else\u2019s product agenda. I have only one goal now\u2026 to give you the best actionable investment insights I can.I have long specialized in rules/factor-based equity investing strategies. But I\u2019m different from others who share such backgrounds. I don\u2019t serve the numbers. Instead, the numbers serve me\u2026 to inspire HI (Human Intelligence) generated investment stories. I definitely understand quant investing, including factors and what not (AI before it was called AI). But I don't agree with what other quants do. Rather than be obsessed with statistical studies that are no good for any time periods other than the ones studied, I combine factor work with the underlying theories of finance including classic fundamental analysis to get the true story of a company and its stock. Investing is about the future. So numbers (which necessarily live in the past) can take us just so far. They\u2019re at their best when they cue us into stories that shed light on what\u2019s likely to happen in the future. And that\u2019s how I use them,I\u2019ve had a pretty colorful career. Besides a full range of experience covering stocks from lots of different groups (large cap, small cap, micro cap, value, growth, income, special situations \u2026 you name it, I covered it) I\u2019ve developed and worked with many different quant models. In addition, I formerly managed a high-yield fixed-income (\u201cjunk bond\u201d) fund and conducted research involving quantitative asset allocation strategies such as are at the foundation of what today has come to be known as Robo Advising. I formerly edited and or wrote several stock newsletters, the most noteworthy having been the Forbes Low Priced Stock Report. I previously served as an assistant research director at Value Line.I also have long had a passion for investor education, which has resulted in my having conducted numerous seminars on stock selection and analysis, and the authoring of two books: Screening The Market and The Value Connection.I\u2019m looking forward to my new incarnation on Seeking Alpha. I hope you enjoy what I offer. But if you don\u2019t, feel free to tell me why in the comment sections. I\u2019m a big boy. I can handle criticism. (But please don\u2019t call me \u201cstupid.\u201d That\u2019s my wife\u2019s job!)",
