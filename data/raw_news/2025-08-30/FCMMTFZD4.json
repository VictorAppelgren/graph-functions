  "description": "Consumer Reports gathers information on various cars to determine which one is the least reliable, and this year's is a surprisingly well-known make.",
  "content": "Who Makes The Least Reliable Car In 2025, According To Consumer Reports?\n\nWhen we are looking for a new vehicle to buy, we often look for the most reliable car brands on the market. New vehicles cost a lot of money, and you want your investment in this machine to pay off in the long run. That being said, it's also important to know what drivers consider to be the least reliable vehicles out there. That way, you know what to avoid when buying that new car. A great resource for this is Consumer Reports, which surveys actual owners of just about every vehicle you could imagine. While most of the publication's findings are for people who actually pay for the magazine or website, Consumer Reports did publish its list of what it has found to be the least reliable vehicles of the 2025 model year, and it turns out that if you are looking to get yourself a 2025 Ford F-150 Hybrid, you should probably think twice. This model is dead last on the publication's ranking. It has a stunningly low reliability rating of 7 out of 100, making it the sole entry on the list with a single-digit reliability rating. It should be noted that Consumer Reports labels this as \"predicted reliability.\" This takes into account the opinions of drivers, yes, but it also takes into account the vehicle's previous model years, charting the downward trend of its reliability ratings. It singles out the transmission, drive system, hybrid battery, electronics, and more as trouble spots, which are almost every important thing in a vehicle. Even with our own glowingly positive review of the truck, Consumer Reports clearly has a different opinion on the 2025 F-150 Hybrid.\n\nFord has other unreliable models too The 2025 Ford F-150 Hybrid is not the only entry on the Consumer Reports list of the least reliable vehicles from the Ford Motor Company. The list features 12 models in total, and three of them come from Ford. Making up one-quarter of any worst list is not where you want to be. One of the other two Ford models is another eco-friendly variation of the most popular pickup truck in the United States, the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning. This is the all-electric version of the truck, and Consumer Reports gives it a predicted reliability score of 28 out of 100. Two of its biggest trouble spots are the EV battery and EV charging, and those are incredibly important features for having a successful, reliable electric vehicle. The 2025 F-150 Lightning Pro was another model we here at SlashGear gave a very positive review to, but Consumer Reports sees things very differently. The other Ford model that makes this list is another hybrid. In this case, it's the 2025 Ford Escape Hybrid, the compact SUV that is among the 25 best-selling vehicles in the United States. This model ranks even lower than the F-150 Lightning on the Consumer Reports list, thanks to its 21 out of 100 predicted reliability rating. The publication notes that the brakes, in-car electronics, and the engine's electrical systems cause issues. Along with that, it is prone to noises and leaks, along with needing to possibly replace your entire hybrid battery. Ford may be trying to create more eco-friendly vehicles with these three models, but it still needs to figure out how to make them more reliable.\n\nFord is not alone when it comes to making up a significant percentage of the 2025 Consumer Reports unreliability ranking. Jeep also has three different models on the list. The lowest rated are the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L models. Both have a predicted reliability score of 22 out of 100. As they are very similar vehicles, they share many of the same issues, including with the drive system, brakes, steering/suspension, and more. The 2025 Jeep Wrangler is not too far behind these two with a predicted reliability score of 27 out of 100, which shares several of those same issues as the Grand Cherokee models, as well as the engine. Three other American-made vehicles are featured, meaning that American productions make up three-quarters of the list. The second-least reliable is the 2025 GMC Canyon, only earning a predicted reliability score of 15 out of 100. That is tied with the 2025 GMC Chevrolet Colorado. These two are sister vehicles and mechanically identical, so it makes sense that they'd have the same predicted reliability rating from drivers. The other American vehicle on the list is the 2025 Rivian R1T pickup truck with a 20 out of 100 predicted reliability rating. The internationally-produced vehicles on the list come from Japan, South Korea, and Germany. From Japan, we have the 2025 Nissan Frontier with a 27 out of 100 rating. The South Korean vehicle is the luxury 2025 Genesis G70 \u2014 the only sedan to make this list \u2014 thanks to a 29 out of 100 rating. Lastly, there's the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4 from Germany, also with a 29 rating.",

      "text": "The Most Reliable Car Brands You Can Buy In 2025\nBuying a car is a massive investment. Not only does the average American hold onto their cars for well over a decade, but cars depreciate in value from the moment they're driven off the lot. That means you'll never get out what you put in financially. For those reasons, it's important to buy a reliable vehicle that'll go the distance. After all, nothing feels worse than spending tens of thousands of dollars on a car and then having to fix it every year.\nThis is harder said than done because there are dozens of vehicle models on the market, and they are not all made the same. One brand may have excellent, reliable SUVs that stand the test of time while simultaneously selling cars that no new driver should buy. Even then, model years matter, and some years are better than others for virtually all vehicles, so it's worth taking a look every year to see where brands are when it comes to the overall reliability of their product lineup.\nIf you're car shopping in 2025, here's a list of brands that pass the test in terms of reliability. It is worth noting that most authorities on the matter consider today's vehicles to be a little less reliable than ones from years ago. Per JD Power, the main reason for this is basically a holdover from the pandemic when materials were out of sorts and the increasing number of infotainment problems customers have. With that said, let's talk about reliable car brands.\nNissan\nWe start our list with Nissan. In terms of overall reliability, Nissan is fairly average, scoring decent marks from JD Power, RepairPal, and other sources. That means that you have pretty good odds of getting a Nissan vehicle that'll last you for quite a while, but there are clearly better options out there in terms of reliability. That includes the entire lineup, from Nissan's insanely popular Nissan Rogue to the Frontier and everything in between.\nFor the most part, it seems the authorities on the matter like Nissan. JD Power gives most vehicles in the lineup favorable reliability ratings but does tend to be sweeter on vehicles with larger engines like the Frontier and Murano. Those larger engines tend to be naturally aspirated, which also tends to be more reliable overall. RepairPal says that Nissan vehicles can expect to break down less frequently than many other brands but does note that the severity of the breakdowns tends to be slightly higher than average.\nWith that said, the brand isn't without its controversies. A couple of Nissan's engines included in some Nissan Rogues and Altima models had a defect that caused premature engine failure. It seems the brand has cleaned up the mess, so 2025 models shouldn't be affected by the defect. Still, it's worth inquiring about before purchasing a new Nissan.\nInfiniti\nInfiniti is Nissan's luxury brand. As such, the two commonly share parts under the hood, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that the two are fairly close together in the rankings. In fact, you could swap Infiniti for Nissan, and it would still be accurate as the two are virtually tied. JD Power is a little sweeter on Infiniti than it is on Nissan, but RepairPal likes Nissan a little more. Take that for what you will.\nIn any case, the same logic that these authorities have with Nissan holds true for Infiniti. The vehicles with the highest reliability ratings tend to be the brand's larger vehicles with larger engines. For example, JD Power says that the Infiniti QX80 is quite a bit more reliable than the smaller QX60. With that said, the predicted reliability of the brand's lineup is mostly positive or at least average, so Infiniti does okay overall. The big news here, though, is that Infiniti and Nissan are about the same.\nWith its close relationship with Nissan, Infiniti also had to deal with the three and four-cylinder engine issues in the brand's QX50 and QX55. The engines have since been cleaned up, but we might stick with the larger engines for Infiniti just to make sure.\nGenesis\nGenesis is in a similar spot as Nissan. None of the authorities on reliability rank the brand particularly high, but they also don't rank the brand as low either. It appears as though the powers that be consider Genesis average when it comes to overall reliability. Part of that is likely because Genesis is Hyundai's luxury brand, and luxury vehicles are judged a little harsher. The reason why varies, but it tends to stem from the fact that repairs and maintenance are more expensive on luxury models.\nGenesis doesn't have a ton of cars in its lineup so determining the best ones is pretty simple. Most authorities agree that the brand's sedans are more reliable than the SUVs. During our research, we found that the sedans like the G80 were considered noticeably more reliable than the GV80. There could be any number of reasons for this but most of the blame likely comes from the higher number of options like the Genesis GV80's electronically controlled suspension system that doesn't make an appearance in the G80. More moving parts usually means more problems.\nUnlike Nissan, Genesis lacks recent controversies. Indeed, by most accounts we could find, there are plenty of happy Genesis owners out there who have had little to no problems with their cars.\nBuick\nConsidering that GM brands tend to do poorly on predicted reliability rankings, it's kind of a surprise that Buick is here at all. Based on our research, it is the most reliable GM brand on the market and it's not particularly close. JD Power is the happiest with Buick's offerings, giving it 2nd place overall in its 2025 predicted reliability report. RepairPal and other authorities consider Buick slightly above average overall, which is a lot better than its corporate stablemates. We're not entirely sure why since all of GM's brands use similar parts.\nOur theory is that it's because Buick doesn't have that many models to bring down the average. Buick also bucks the trend of its larger vehicles having better-predicted reliability than the smaller ones. In fact, its Encore GX SUV is the brand's highest-rated Buick vehicle on JD Power despite being the smallest. Overall, all vehicles in Buick's lineup scored within a few points of each other, making it one of the most consistent brands on the list.\nGM has some of the biggest engine recalls in U.S. history, but none of the recent ones have affected Buick. In one instance, GM had to recall 500,000 vehicles for diesel engine woes. Buick doesn't use diesel engines, which is why they're here and the other GM products aren't.\nSubaru\nSubaru is much in the same position as Buick. Some reliability websites rank Subaru quite highly, while others are a little more lukewarm on the auto brand. However, Subaru scored above average everywhere and is definitely worthy of being on the list. Per RepairPal, Subarus have the same deal as Nissan. They tend to break down less frequently, but repairs tend to be more costly.\nWe don't know if it's Subaru's excellent boxer engines or what, but the brand has a pretty good track record overall. The Outback and Forester both score quite well, with the Crosstrek being among the highest rated vehicles in Subaru's lineup. The question mark appears to be the Subaru WRX. We're not sure if it's because people tend to drive WRX models more aggressively or if it's because modding is fairly commonplace, but they have historically not been the most reliable vehicles. This drags Subaru's score on some websites, even if the WRX isn't the brand's most popular car.\nThe short answer is this. If you want a reliable Subaru, you should probably stick with the more mainstream options or refrain from driving your WRX like you stole it.\nHyundai\nAh yes, the Hyundai and Kia twins. It wasn't long ago that both brands were considered toward the bottom of the reliability stack, either due to their former low-cost nature or because of the brand's hilariously unsuccessful Theta II engine. Regardless, both brands seem to have shed those old woes and are doing quite well these days. For Hyundai, the brand ranks above average on just about every website with RepairPal calling them a top 10 brand in terms of reliability.\nThere doesn't appear to be a reason for Hyundai's turnaround. In general, Hyundai's big-ticket items like the Tucson, Elantra, and Palisade all score high marks on all the reliability websites we looked at. There doesn't seem to be a pattern or reason for it. They are just solid vehicles. In fact, just a few years ago, Hyundai may have scored even higher on our list. However, EVs do not rank well in reliability ratings in general and the brand's Ioniq 6 definitely drags it down a bit in the rankings.\nOur advice is get the EV if you don't mind a few more repair shop trips, but most of the rest of the brand's lineup should be good, especially with Hyundai's long warranty.\nKia\nKia's ranking is virtually identical to Hyundai's. Generally speaking, we saw only minor differences on the various reliability websites. JD Power and RepairPal both like Kia a hair more than Hyundai. In all honesty, you could flip-flop Kia and Hyundai on any list you see them on, and it would still be accurate. Both companies use virtually the same architectures, engines, and other components, with most of the differences being in interior and exterior styling.\nThus, it should be no surprise that Kia's most reliable vehicles are just their versions of the same Hyundai vehicles. The Telluride, Kia K5, and Sportage all score high marks just like their Hyundai counterparts. The low points in terms of reliability are Kia's EV vehicles, such as the EV6, just like Hyundai's Ioniq. You see where this is going. The brands are nearly identical in terms of reliability because their vehicles are nearly identical where it counts.\nWith that said, the vehicles do look and behave differently. Hyundai tends to lean more luxury while Kia tends to lean sportier, resulting in different engine and suspension tunings. It's best to test drive both before making any decisions.\nAcura\nAcura is Honda's luxury brand and, as such, shares the same relationship that Nissan and Infiniti do. Acura is a darling on the reliability charts, scoring quite high nearly everywhere we looked. Only JD Power seemed a little sour on the brand, stating that their metrics showed that Acura was in the shop more often than other brands. Acura's lineup is quite small, so part of its advantage on a list like this is that there are fewer bad vehicles to drag down the averages.\nThat isn't to say Acura is perfect. Its RDX and MDX SUVs are the apple in Acura's eye when it comes to reliability, scoring well on every website we checked. Meanwhile, the sedans did a little bit worse than their SUV counterparts, which prevented Acura from climbing even further up the list. Additionally, Acura revived its ZDX badge for use in its new electric vehicle. It's too new to find trustworthy reliability numbers but EVs in general tend to score worse on these things anyway, which doesn't help Acura here.\nWe advise sticking with the SUVs since they are Acura's bread and butter, and you should be fine. The cars are still good, just slightly less so.\nHonda\nHonda has some of the most reliable vehicles ever built, and some of their engines have proven that they can stand the test of time. As such, it should be no surprise that Honda trends to the top of the leaderboards here. All reliability authorities scored Honda above average, with RepairPal scoring Honda as the most reliable brand according to its metrics. RepairPal says its metrics show that Honda not only goes to the mechanic less often, but its issues are generally not severe, leading to overall lower ownership costs.\nTo the surprise of no one, the CR-V is Honda's best-rated vehicle when it comes to reliability. The HR-V and Ridgeline also score well. Much like Acura, the sedans are a little less favorable, with the Accord scoring a merely average rating. Like Acura, Hyundai, and Kia \u2014 the inclusion of the Honda Prologue as an EV skews the ratings a little bit here. It's simply too new to get reliable data at this time but we already know that EVs tend to be less reliable.\nOverall, Honda is a solid brand, and its EVs are likely better than most. Even so, the CR-V is an easy choice for something functional and reliable.\nMazda\nMazda is an interesting case. It's the first brand on the list that has scored in the top 10 on every reliability list we looked through. In fact, it's one of only three automakers that can boast that distinction. Its highest ranking comes from JD Power, which ranks it third overall on its leaderboards, followed by RepairPal's fifth-place ranking. RepairPal says that Mazda's breakdown frequency is about average but that the severity of those breakdowns is rarely severe.\nMazda may fall down a few slots next year as it continues to phase out old products in place of new ones. As it stands, legacy products like the CX-5, Mazda3, and CX-30 carry the rankings with the highest marks among Mazda's lineup. The CX-50 and CX-90 are at the bottom but still garner at least average ratings overall.\nThe big thing working against Mazda is that they've introduced a few new cars in recent years. The CX-50 is only a few years old while the CX-90 was introduced in 2024. The middle child \u2014 the CX 70 \u2014 is new for the 2025 model year. None of those have a ton of historical reliability data yet, so we'll have to wait and see how they will do over the long term.\nToyota\nToyota is the second automaker to have top-10 finishes on every reliability list we sorted through. In fact, only RepairPal's 7th place rating kept Toyota from being the first automaker with top five placements all around. This shouldn't come as a surprise. Toyota has long been hailed as being a little bit boring but about as bulletproof as an auto brand can get. It seems 2025 won't be much different from the last couple of years for Toyota,\nToyota has a bunch of vehicles in its lineup. The Rav4, Highlander, Camry, and Corolla all score well on reliability metrics, which is surprising because Toyota sells hybrid models of all of those, and the electrification didn't lower the reliability scores by much. Among the hybrids, Toyota's recently redesigned Prius sits at the bottom but still scores higher than many hybrids. Only Toyota's bZ4X scored anything other than above average. It's the EV in the lineup, so that makes sense.\nThe short answer is that you can buy a Toyota with confidence. While their cars are often referred to as appliances for how boring they are, they'll get you and your family from point A to point B for years to come.\nLexus\nLexus is the highest-rated individual automaker on the list by every metric we could find. It scored top marks on JD Power, was in the top three on most other reliability ratings, and scored 6th on RepairPal. It's slightly lower score on RepairPal is almost certainly because it's a luxury brand, which is intrinsically more expensive as its breakdown rates and severity on RepairPal rivaled other top three automakers. In short, the only thing keeping Lexus down is technicalities.\nLet's break it down: The brand is held up by its RX 350 and ES 350 models, with the ES 350 having the highest predicted reliability of any model we've mentioned in this article. Its NX models also do quite well and even the hybrids do better than most. The bad mark on an otherwise excellent report card is the RZ, which is Lexus' EV. There simply wasn't enough reliability data since the badge is still so new, but we imagine it's not far off from other EVs.\nLexus is a luxury brand, so it's quite a bit more expensive than most of the other automakers on the list. That'll keep most folks from buying one, but those that do have good odds of getting a reliable car.\nMethodology\nFor the most part, this list was written using the process of elimination. We looked at predicted reliability from sites like JD Power and historical data from sites like RepairPal and started pruning the metaphorical bush from there. For example, BMW rated highly on many predicted reliability lists but was among the worst on RepairPal's list, so it was excluded. Meanwhile, other brands like Audi, Ford, most GMC brands, and all Stellantis brands ranked below average on every list we found, so they were also excluded.\nMeanwhile, EVs all ranked poorly on every list we found, canceling out Rivian, Tesla, and similar brands. The data is there and it can't be ignored as it also dragged down the score of every automaker that has one in their lineup. However, this makes sense because EVs are a new car technology, and it takes a while to work out the various bugs and issues. EVs will become more reliable as the years go but they're still in their infancy relative to the internal combustion engine.\nWe also want to point out that lists like this are intrinsically inexact. You can move the list around in a few different ways depending on how you look at the data and it'll still be accurate. However, we are confident that the automakers above have the best odds of pumping out a reliable vehicle."

      "text": "2025 Ford F-150 Review: Hybrid V6 And New BlueCruise Help Find The Sweet Spot\nI could tell you how well the Ford F-150 has sold over the years but, at this point, that seems fairly redundant. Life at the bleeding (sales) edge of pickups in the U.S. gives Ford a perennial marketing boast, but it also puts the F-150 in the sights of every would-be challenger, whether storied or startup. A big bed and some nice seats are no longer enough to be truck royalty: these days you need technology, and useful technology, to hold on to your crown.\nOfficially, Ford wanted me to test out the latest iteration of BlueCruise, its hands-free driving assistance system for highways. In fact, the F-150 is the first to get the very latest update to the tech, version 1.4, though other models in the automaker's range will follow shortly after.\nThe truth of it, though, is that nobody is going to buy an F-150 solely for BlueCruise. And, equally true, the F-150 line-up has expanded over the years into a fairly arcane \u2014 and unarguably confusing \u2014 array of options, beyond just bed and cab size. With the EcoBoost Full Hybrid also in the mix, just where does the pickup sweet spot now lie?\nThe V6 hybrid is the one to have\nThough the knee-jerk reaction to not picking a V8 isn't quite so strong \u2014 just like Ford's decision to switch to aluminum for the F-150's body now seems prescient, not preposterous \u2014 and the truck's various EcoBoost options are sound, I'd still spend my own money on the hybrid. Available on the XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum trims, it's a $1,900 option on this 2025 F-150 SuperCrew Lariat.\nIt bumps the regular 3.5-liter turbo V6's 400 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque to 430 hp and 570 lb-ft, respectively, and includes both 4x4 and a 10-speed automatic transmission as standard. More important, from behind the wheel, it leaves the F-150 feeling more enthusiastic around town. The regular EcoBoost isn't especially prone to turbo lag, but adding electrification gives a welcome shove that helps you ignore the fact you're driving a hefty full-size truck.\nAlso present on this particular F-150 was the $1,095 FX4 Off-Road Package. It adds Hill Descent Control and Rock Crawl Mode, off-road tuned front shocks and monotube rear shocks, and extra protection to the fuel tank, front diff, and transfer case. I'm not sure it made much difference to me in the Michigan snow and ice, but the Ford never felt less than sure-footed (and the 4A mode handled all-wheel drive transitions seamlessly).\nBlueCruise v1.4 raises its hands-free driving game\nThe 2025 F-150 is the first of Ford's fleet to support BlueCruise 1.4, the automaker's hands-off highway driving assistant. Resolutely not self-driving (regardless of what other automakers might claim of their similarly Level 2 systems), BlueCruise expects drivers to pay attention to the road ahead and be poised to retake the wheel should issues arise. However, on stretches of pre-mapped highway, it can maintain lane position, speed and distance from the vehicle in front, and change lanes for you on demand.\nVersion 1.4 has a number of improvements, with Ford suggesting better performance in tight curves and narrow lanes \u2014 BlueCruise will already offset its lane positioning, if a larger vehicle like a truck is looming alongside \u2014 along with more resilience to sun reflecting into the sensors, and during periods of inclement weather. The success of the latter was my biggest question, given the snowy conditions in the Midwest winter that coincided with my loan.\nWhile nature declined to supply me with anything close to a whiteout or blizzard, the F-150 handled snowy and slushy lanes just fine, as well as reduced visibility. Quite honestly, I wouldn't want my ADAS to be active during weather conditions more tricky: BlueCruise's assisted lane changes (launched in v1.2), which are triggered by tapping the turn signal stalk, are reasonably conservative, but there were still a couple of times when the system would've been content to pull across even though a higher-speed car was approaching on the semi-slippery asphalt. Just as with retaking manual steering control, deciding when is \u2014 and isn't \u2014 a safe time and stretch of highway to use BlueCruise is down to the human driver.\nHands-off, but not quite pulling ahead\nGenerally, I'm a fan of BlueCruise: though there are always a few miles of hesitancy, on my part, with any of these hands-off systems, Ford's tech is a confident and fairly reserved driver. I never had to weigh in for a bad decision, and \u2014 though far from scientific \u2014 it felt like the system deactivated less frequently due to road conditions, too.\nThere's still room for improvement, mind. Unlike GM's SuperCruise, which can automatically initiate a lane-change if the vehicle ahead is slower than the speed the system is set to, Ford's version currently won't do that. BlueCruise will suggest you change lane if you're traveling below your set speed for a period \u2014 I got the notification after a fairly long stretch at around 64 mph, when I'd set it to 70 mph \u2014 but we'll need to wait until BlueCruise 1.5 (likely to arrive later this year, and on the 2025 Mustang Mach-E first) for automatic lane changes.\nThat, of course, highlights one of the strengths of these systems, with Ford able to push out new versions to vehicles already on the road. The downside is the subscription fee. Lariat and Tremor trim buyers get a 90-day trial of BlueCruise on the F-150, while King Ranch and Platinum get a full year of use. After that, it's $495 annually, or $49.99 per month.\nMore potent Pro Power is the hybrid's wildcard\nThere are more reasons to like the hybrid F-150 than just its on-road performance. Ford's Pro Power system basically turns the pickup into a mobile generator, capable of powering work sites, homes experiencing outages, and campsites.\nWhile the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 \u2014 standard on the King Ranch, Platinum, Tremor, and Raptor trims \u2014 gets Pro Power with 2kW output, the more potent versions are saved for the hybrid engine. That means 2.4 kW standard (or 7.2 kW optional) is available on the XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, or Platinum trims with that engine. Now, an all-electric F-150 Lightning can deliver more juice \u2014 up to 9.6 kW \u2014 and tie into Ford's special home backup system that automatically switches over to the EV's battery if the grid goes down, but that doesn't make the hybrid systems disappointing.\nIn the case of the 7.2 kW version on this F-150 Lariat, for $850 you get two 120V/20A outlets in the bed, capable of 2.4 kW apiece. Or, you can plug into the 240V/30A outlet, to get the full 7.2 KW. That's enough to run proper workshop equipment or, with a generator interlock kit or similar, keep the essentials in your home running during a power outage. It's a huge advantage, especially given most full EVs still don't have 240V output support yet. Ford also adds a number of 120V outlets in the cabin.\nLariat straddles comfort and practicality\nInside, the middle-of-the-trim-walk Lariat straddles the worlds of work truck and a little luxury. The seats are clad in sturdy faux-leather, but they're still heated and ventilated in the front, paired with a heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel. There's a 12-inch touchscreen running SYNC4, dual-zone climate control, an embedded 5G modem with optional Wi-Fi hotspot, and a 360-degree camera, together with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support. Power-adjustable pedals, an 8-speaker B&O audio system, remote start and remote tailgate release, and a power-sliding rear window are also included on the Lariat.\nThis particular example had the $7,725 Lariat High Equipment Group (502A), too. It adds a head-up display, an upgraded B&O audio system with 14 speakers, heated second row seats, and the Mobile Office Package. Press a button to lower the transmission shifter \u2014 it slowly whirs down flush with the console, like a Transformer taking a cold plunge \u2014 and you can unfold the front center armrest into a flat desk.\nApparently F-150 drivers still like the reassurance of a physical shifter, hence Ford not replacing it with buttons, though I can't say I found its action forward and backward particularly satisfying.\nFord is, at least, liberal with its cubbies and storage bins. In the back, the split rear bench folds up; the resulting floor isn't entirely flat, though. A twin-panel moonroof is $1,495, while the Pro Access tailgate is part of the $1,620 Bed Utility Package. $430 adds a retractable rear center step, while the FX4 Off-Road Package sensibly swaps the Lariat's carpets for tailored (and easy to clean) rubber floor mats.\nJust where is the F-150 sweet spot in 2025?\nRoaming higher through the F-150 trims certainly gets you a more lavish truck (or, in the case of the Raptor, a more aggressive one), but I can't help but feel like the Lariat is the sweet spot. It's not exactly cheap \u2014 frankly, no full-size pickup is cheap these days, unless it's in barebones work truck spec \u2014 but it's the cheapest way to get both the full hybrid drivetrain and BlueCruise.\nWith the electrification, a year of the hands-off driving assistance, and the 7.2 kW Pro Power Onboard upgrade, you're at $70,065 including destination. Ford's current incentives slice that down to just shy of $68k. Weather conditions over the week meant I couldn't do my usual gauge of economy, but the EPA's quoted 23 mpg combined comfortably nudges the hybrid V6 ahead of even the smallest 2.7-liter EcoBoost and the 5.0-liter V8 (20 and 19 mpg combined, respectively, in their 4WD forms).\nChevrolet, meanwhile, will only sell you its Super Cruise option (currently around $6k after promotions) on a top-spec Silverado High Country (from $67,990 plus destination). While there's an all-electric Silverado EV, Chevy doesn't have a hybrid engine for the regular pickup.\n2025 Ford F-150 Verdict\nFor many truck buyers, what Chevrolet (or Ram, or anybody else) is doing in their dealerships won't make a jot of difference: brand loyalty arguably sells as many F-150 as the pickup's own talents might. The real question, then, might be whether Ford's updates on the tech side for 2025 leave this a more appealing vehicle, regardless of whether you're using it for work or play.\nI continue to find BlueCruise \u2014 and similar hands-off highway assistance systems \u2014 compelling, though as always there's the important note of being thoroughly aware of just what the tech can, and can't do. For now, with its ability to automatically perform lane-changes in response to slower traffic ahead, GM's Super Cruise still has a practicality edge. However, the fact that Ford makes its system far more available across the F-150 line-up, and that its roadmap includes adding that functionality, means this particular horse race is far from a done-deal.\nCombined with the full hybrid EcoBoost, though, it's a struggle not to recommend the F-150. Short of going for a fully-electric truck (at which point the F-150 Lightning wades into the fight), its combination of on-road enhancements and power features when parked are very nearly enough to have me wondering if I need a full-size pickup in my life (spoiler: I don't, but that doesn't stop me wanting one)."

      "text": "2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro Review: Skip XLT And Spend On Range Instead\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning was a big deal when it was first released in 2022. It was billed as a real work truck that just happened to be electric, as opposed to pickups like the Rivian R1T where most of the focus on the truck itself is the fact it's electric. Other electric versions of American trucks, like the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, bear a slight resemblance to their internal combustion counterparts, but those similarities are entirely superficial.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, monstrosities like the Tesla Cybertruck barely even look like a truck. From most angles, in contrast, the F-150 Lightning could be mistaken for any other regular F-150.\nI grew up with Chevy trucks, so I don't have a lot of experience on the Ford side of the Force, but my family did briefly own a very tired 1990 F-150 with exactly no features in the cabin, so really anything that moves under its own power would be a positive. So, when I was offered an F-150 Lightning, I was eager to see what Ford has done to electrify the its pickup mainstay.\nUtilitarian for a reason\nThe Lightning that arrived in my driveway was painted contractor white and fitted with vinyl seats that look like they were taken right out of the back of a police car. The only line items on the window sticker that could be considered \"features\" were dual-zone air conditioning and heated seats. Other than Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the creature comforts are basically non-existent.\nThis wasn't a mistake at the factory and it's not a result of Ford dropping the ball in marketing the Lightning. This 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning is in the \"PRO\" series that's focused on fleet use or for trade/contracting work. As a result, you won't find it on Ford's regular website; pricing and configuration options are listed Ford's own Pro site.\nIt's bare bones for a reason. You don't want a bunch of features that clutter up the interior when you're on the job site. A premium sound-system doesn't help much when you need to hop in and sprint across the lot ensure that the concrete truck doesn't pour in the wrong place again.\nPower where it's needed\nIgnore the feature-lite nature of the interior, since the mechanical bits are where it shines the most. Under the familiar styling are two electric motors that generate a beefy 452 horsepower and a pretty astonishing 775 pound-feet of torque. I can neither confirm nor deny that I was able to chirp the tires taking off from a stop sign.\nThis Lightning was fitted with the 131 kilowatt-hour Extended Range battery that gave it a maximum range of 320 miles when all charged up (and up to 19.2 kW Level 2 charging support); commercial customers can have the Standard Range version's 98 kWh pack, rated for 240 miles, while the 123 kWh Extended Range battery that's standard on the retail Pro promises 300 miles (and has up to 11.5 kW Level 2 charging).\nWith the biggest pack I was able to get around 300 miles of driving, but it was also well over 90 degrees for most of the week, so that likely adversely impacted the range.\nFor truck people, this Pro was equipped with a Max Trailer Tow Package, which gives it a towing capacity of 7,700 pounds, over the 5,000 pounds of the base model. Lariat-trimmed Lightnings can tow up to 10,000 pounds. It's worth noting that the Rivian R1T can tow up to 11,000 pounds.\nFord's electric muscle truck\nAs for actually driving the Lightning, it was nothing short of a blast. I have the same entertainment sensibilities as a particularly clever ape, so a huge truck with almost 500 horsepower and instant torque is really fun to drive. It's a muscle car that can go to Home Depot. Everyone who says that electric cars are boring have never whipped around an empty parking lot in a Lightning in the rain. It's a lot of fun to drive, dispute its workman-like appearance. I had to run a few errands in downtown Baltimore and it never felt too unwieldy to drive, at least any more than a regular full-size truck. I was even able to parallel park it without much issue.\nAll versions of the Lightning have Pro Power Onboard, which makes sense as they're essentially a rolling battery. In the case of the Pro, the bed, cab, and frunk all feature 120V power outlets: a total of eight as standard, capable of 2.4 kW at 20 amps. A $1,200 upgrade to Pro Power Onboard 9.6 kW not only adds two further outlets, but one in the bed is 240V.\nThat's more than enough juice to run angle grinders, circular saws, and a lot of other job site hardware. Tools with needier power demands like welders would need more external power, but if you're a welder who is reading this and are in the market for an F-150 Lightning, you probably already know that.\nNot a lot going on in the cabin\nThe interior is arguably where the Pro cost-savings are most obvious. Since it has vinyl seats, it got a little sticky-feeling when the temperature reached triple digits occasionally. It never felt stifling on the inside thanks to the freezing cold A/C that was always blasting, but it certainly wasn't ideal when you first get in the car after it's been sitting for a while. My first car was a 1985 Chrysler LeBaron convertible with fake-leather vinyl seats, and getting in the F-150 reminded me a lot of that experience. It's been a while since I sat in a car that had only plastic seats.\nStill, if I was working in a more dirt or grime-centric career, I could see how the vinyl seats would be a lifesaver for keeping the truck clean. Just spray some Clorox, wipe it down, and you'll be fine. I don't think that's the truck's fault, then, it just has a very specific audience.\nA cost-cutting EV\nWhen ordered, this particular 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro started at $47,780 for the 240 mile version intended for commercial customers. Add $6,500 more for the largest, 131 kWh battery; $1,200 for Pro Power Onboard 9.6 kW; $1,100 for the Max Trailer Tow package; $430 for a tailgate that folds down into a work surface and has an integrated step and fold out handle; and $595 for the spray-in bedliner.\nA Ford-branded charging cord is $600, and a spare wheel (remember those?) is $175. Throw in a destination charge of $2,195 and you arrive at the final price of $60,575 for commercial buyers. Currently, the same truck starts at $49,780 before destination, and matching this configuration lands slightly higher overall, at $62,430.\nFord sells the Pro to retail customers, but not with the smallest battery. The cheapest retail version is $54,780 with the 128 kWh (300 mile) battery, $6,500 more for the largest battery with the fastest Level 2 charging. To match this overall spec, though, you're looking at about the same total price.\nThe least expensive Rivian might have a little bit more in the creature comforts department than the Lightning, but it also starts at $70,990 and it's pretty easy to inflate that price to six-figures with the right options. Other trucks, like the GMC Sierra EV, have no issue with high price tags either. The base-model Lightning also has the $55,000 commercial use Silverado EV beat on price, at least for non-retail buyers (though to be fair to the Silverado, it does have much more range).\n2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro Verdict\nIf I had any qualms about the Lightning in this Pro form, I would say that the options list is a little incongruous. It has gloss-black wheels standard, when steel wheels (or at least wheels that look like steel wheels) would fit the work vibe a little bit better. It also could have benefitted from a bench seat in the front.\nThe 12-inch infotainment screen feels incongruous with the rest of the barebones interior. I also think Ford should extend the cost saving options like vinyl seats/floor to the \"civilian\" F-150 Lightning lineup, which has a base price of $63,345 for the XLT with the smallest, 98 kWh battery.\nThe 2025 Ford F-150 really is not only a great EV \u2014 maybe one of my favorites this year \u2014 but it's a great truck in general. It's fun to drive, the interior is as functional as it needs to be, and it has power where it counts. What's not to like?"
