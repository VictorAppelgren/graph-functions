  "description": "There's been a notable change in appetite for EBOS Group Limited ( NZSE:EBO ) shares in the week since its yearly...",
  "content": "There's been a notable change in appetite for EBOS Group Limited (NZSE:EBO) shares in the week since its yearly report, with the stock down 19% to NZ$32.61. Revenues were in line with forecasts, at AU$12b, although statutory earnings per share came in 15% below what the analysts expected, at AU$1.13 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nAfter the latest results, the eleven analysts covering EBOS Group are now predicting revenues of AU$13.0b in 2026. If met, this would reflect a modest 6.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 24% to AU$1.31. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$12.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$1.55 in 2026. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a substantial drop in EPS estimates.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for EBOS Group\n\nThe average price target fell 6.5% to NZ$37.96, with reduced earnings forecasts clearly tied to a lower valuation estimate. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic EBOS Group analyst has a price target of NZ$41.99 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at NZ$32.00. Even so, with a relatively close grouping of estimates, it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations, suggesting EBOS Group is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that EBOS Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 6.1% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 8.6% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 7.9% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that EBOS Group is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.",
