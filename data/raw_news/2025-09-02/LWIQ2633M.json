  "description": "SpaceX is emailing the offer to former customers in Australia, Europe, Canada, and the US.",
  "content": "Don't miss out on our latest stories. as a preferred source on Google.\n\nIf you subscribed to but later dropped Starlink , SpaceX might try to lure you back with a freebie.\n\nThe company is offering one month of free Starlink service to select customers who cancelled their satellite internet subscription. \u201cWe're inviting you to try Starlink again\u2014free until September 30,\u201d says a SpaceX email that went out this weekend to subscribers in Australia, Europe, Canada, and the US.\n\nThe email adds: \u201cThis free service applies only to your canceled service line(s).\u201d An official Starlink support page also notes : \"This free service until September 30th is only available to canceled or suspended Starlink service lines (UTs) that received an official email from Starlink.\"\n\nAlthough Starlink is known for bringing high-speed broadband to rural and remote areas, there can be a variety of reasons why a user drops the service. For some, the pause is only temporary because their Starlink dish is used intermittently for RV or camping trips.\n\nOther users might have quit for alternatives because Starlink has drawbacks . In the US, the Starlink residential plan is a pricey $120 per month, and the network can experience congestion if your area is already full of existing subscribers.\n\nHowever, the email from SpaceX notes that SpaceX has launched over 2,300 new satellites over the past year to help Starlink deliver faster speeds and lower latency. The message also points out new upgrades, including a recent \u201c beam switching technology \u201d update that can help a Starlink dish work better under tree cover.\n\nSpaceX is offering the free month of service as it looks to attract more users \u2014 often through discounts. Last month, SpaceX took the rare step of reducing the monthly fee for Starlink for new subscribers in the US. Prior to this, the company was offering the dish hardware for free to customers in certain areas.\n\nIn July, SpaceX revealed that Starlink had increased to over 2 million active customers in the US, up from 1.4 million about a year ago, when its growth showed signs of slowing. Globally, the satellite internet service hit a new milestone last month, reaching 7 million users. Starlink is available in over 150 countries.",

You can view previous months' charges in the billing tab of your Starlink account. For specific details you can download invoices for review.

Please note, we experience high demand during the first two weeks of each month so there may be a 3-4 day delay until you receive your e-invoice.\nIf your device was damaged or defective and you were offline, you may be eligible for a credit for the period you were offline. First check if you have already been issued a credit as this will typically happen at time of replacement. If you have not, please contact support to determine if you are eligible.\nThe 30-day trial mentioned on the Starlink website does not indicate the first month of service being free, as it is not a 30-day free trial but just a trial of the Starlink hardware.\nInstead, it refers to how, if you are unhappy with the service or product within the first 30 days of using the service after billing has begun, you can return the hardware for a full refund.\nWhen returning your hardware to a retailer within the 30 day return window, make sure to cancel your Starlink service through your Starlink account. Service refunds are processed by us only after the customer's service line has been canceled. Retailers handle only hardware returns and refunds.\nA payment that is shown as pending means that the payment has been initiated but is not yet complete. Some payment methods like ACH (Direct Debit / Sepa / Sofort) as well as Mobile Money may take up to 5 business days for fully process at which point they will be marked as complete or failed. We appreicate your patience during this time as there is nothing that can done to shorten this time.\nIf you have a pending payment and no payable balance you will be unable to intiate another payment until after the pending payment fails or succeeds. In the meantime, you are still able to update your payment method - though this will affect future payments and not the one that is currently pending.\nSometimes a payment can be applied to multiple invoices. This is usually the case when a payment for a previous invoice failed. It can be helpful to look at the service periods, invoice due dates, and subscription types for the corresponding invoices for more information.\nYour Starlink subscription service is a month to month service which is not contingent on usage.\nMuch like other monthly subscriptions or a cell phone carrier, services are still being provided regardless of the amount data used as we're maintaining your dish's spot within our network.\nTo determine if you have successfully cancelled service, your service line will have an end date. If the end date is in the future that means your service end on that day. If it is in the past that means you previously cancelled service.\nPlease note, billing cycles are in UTC so all changes must be made before midnight UTC on your billing day of the month to take effect before the next billing cycle.\nAdditionally, if you opted-in for additional roam or priority data, you may still be billed after ending service as these charges are post-paid.\nFor customers on a 12-month Residential service contract, any of the following actions will result in a Change Fee:\nYou can view your existing service credits at the bottom of the Billing page on your Starlink account. Credits have a type (service, hardware, generic) which dicates to what types of invoices they can be applied. Credits also have a total amount and an available amount. The total amount refers to the total amount of the credit. The available amount refers to the amount of the credit that is remaining. The difference is the amount that has already been applied. You can download recent invoices to see on which a credit has been applied.\nIf you are still suspended after making a payment it is important to check if the payment is still pending. Past-due payments must be fully captured before you are reactivated. Credit card payments at typically pending for less than a minute but can take up to an hour. Direct debit or Mobile Money payments can take up to 5 business days to fully capture.\nIf you are required to register additional information, please make sure to submit your information through the alert in your Starlink account. After submitting, allow for up to 24 hours for your information to be verified. Once verified, you will be automatically reactivated.\nTo confirm that your information has been submitted and verification is in progress, look for an open support ticket titled: \"Registration of your Identification Information\".\nWe\u2019ve given canceled and suspended Starlink terminals free, high-speed service until September 30 so you can experience our improved network. Over the past year, SpaceX has launched more than 2,300 new satellites, delivering faster speeds, lower latency, and more reliable service worldwide.\nStarlink has provided you with a free month of service. If you wish not to take advantage of this, simply do nothing. On September 30th, the service will no longer be able to be activated for free. Even if you choose to use the service, you would not be charged unless you take action to subscribe to a paid plan.\nDoes this free service apply to all my service lines? No. This free service until September 30th applies only to your canceled or suspended service line(s).\nDo I need to do anything to activate the free service?

If you\u2019re ready to move to a paid plan, we recommend waiting until September 30 to make the switch in your account. That way, you\u2019ll get the full benefit of your free month before billing begins.\nWhen does my new billing date start? If you activate a paid plan on September 30th, you\u2019ll be charged a pro-rated amount from that day until your original billing date. After that, billing continues on your original billing date as usual.\nExample: If your billing date was the 15th and you switch to a new plan on September 30, you\u2019ll receive a pro-rated charge for September 30\u2013October 15. Going forward, you\u2019ll continue to be billed on the 15th of each month.\nWhat type of plan am I on until September 30th? During this one-time window until September 30th, you\u2019re receiving free access to Starlink\u2019s high-speed service. When your free service ends, you can choose the paid plan that works best for you. Learn more about service plans.\nHow do I know if I\u2019m eligible? This free service until September 30th is only available to canceled or suspended Starlink service lines (UTs) that received an official email from Starlink.
