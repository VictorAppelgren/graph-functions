  "content": "GUANGZHOU, China, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XPENG Motors (\"XPENG\" or the \"Company\"; NYSE: XPEV, HKEX: 9868), a leading China-based high-tech company, announced that starting August 25, it will roll out the global OTA upgrade of XOS 5.8.0.\n\nThis update is far more than a routine enhancement, it represents a thoughtfully localized, insight-driven integration of XPENG's core strengths in intelligent driving and smart cabin technologies, delivering a truly elevated experience for our users worldwide.\n\nBuilding on a legacy of intelligent innovation, XPENG remains dedicated to placing user experience at the heart of its operations. With XOS 5.8.0, the third major OTA release of 2025 following the widely acclaimed versions XOS 5.4.5 in January and XOS 5.6.0 in May. Each of these releases raised application standards in safety, personalization, and driving assistance.\n\nThe XOS 5.8.0 OTA upgrade powerfully demonstrates XPENG's promise: to listen closely to user feedback and respond quickly to market expectations. As XPENG continues to expand the suite of intelligent features, XPENG is pioneering new pathways for the global electric vehicle industry.\n\nWith XOS 5.8.0, XPENG becomes the first and only automaker in Europe to offer standard Human-Machine Co-Driving.\n\nWhen Lane Centering Control (LCC) is active, the system now shares control with the driver. Rather than disengaging when the driver steers, LCC remains active, resulting in smoother, more natural driving assistance. LCC also demonstrates improved performance in complex scenarios such as highway merges and exits, with reduced steering oscillation.\n\nApart from that, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) has been significantly enhanced for higher cornering speeds and more comfortable deceleration.\n\nDesigned for pet-loving families, the new Pet Mode, ensures safety and comfort when pets are left unattended briefly. Windows close automatically, doors lock, and the climate system maintains a comfortable temperature and air circulation.\n\nThe AUTO Climate Control Mode with external air circulation prevents overheating or excessive cold. Owners will receive real-time alerts via the XPENG app and can remotely activate or deactivate the mode. This feature enhances safety for users who need to briefly leave their pets in the car.\n\nThis OTA upgrade brings the new KaraFun feature. Users can simply download KaraFun from the in-car App Store to start enjoying it.",
