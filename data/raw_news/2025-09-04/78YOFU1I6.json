The company saw its momentum flag when higher interest rates began to crimp startup funding.\n\nBrex has been involved in an aggressive turnaround effort in the last two years, described by one investor as \u201ca torturous journey\u201d that involved \u201crepositioning the company, firing a bunch of people, getting people back in the office and shedding the excess from 2020/2021,\u201d per the report.\n\nNow, the company is on the verge of making more than it spends for the first time, according to the report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen in the next two quarters, at this point it\u2019s sort of inevitable,\u201d Franceschi said, per the report.\n\nIn January, Brex secured a $235 million credit facility provided by senior lender Citi and participating lender TPG Angelo Gordon.\n\nCorporate credit cards stand out as the preferred choice for 52% of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that are seeking alternative financing, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cOne-Quarter of SMBs Plan to Increase Corporate Card Usage This Year.\u201d\n\nNearly 92% of the surveyed businesses said they went with corporate cards as a working capital tool because of the ability to cover predictable expenses, while nearly 80% mentioned using business cards to address unexpected expenses.\n\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.",

      "text": "The company, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) for financial automation, achieved that valuation after raising $500 million in its latest funding round, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Wednesday (July 30).\nThe funds will help Ramp hire engineers, product experts and marketing and sales staff who focus on building and selling Ramp\u2019s AI agents, Co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman told the WSJ. Those agents help corporate finance teams automate things like expense report compliance, with future versions set to assist with procurement and bookkeeping, Glyman said.\n\u201cFunctionally, we\u2019re teaching software to think like people,\u201d he said, adding that the future of corporate finance will feature significantly more automation.\nThe WSJ report notes that the funding round is happening in tandem with the rapid growth of AI agents, autonomous bots that can carry out tasks on behalf of humans. Ramp deployed its first AI agent earlier this month, and says thousands of customers have since signed on to try it.\nAmong them is Richard Gobea, a finance manager at Quora, who said the question-and-answer website uses the agent to automate the work of an entry-level accountant or clerk who normally checks worker expenses against a corporate policy document.\n\u201cI\u2019m spending my time digging in a little more on the expenses the AI agent is flagging,\u201d he said.\nDespite the potential benefits of using AI agents, the risks are even starker, PYMNTS wrote recently. A growing number of voices are calling for restraint in agents\u2019 deployment, including Trustly Chief Legal and Compliance Officer Kathryn McCall.\n\u201cYou\u2019re messing with people\u2019s money here,\u201d she said in a recent for the June edition of the \u201cWhat\u2019s Next in Payments\u201d series, \u201cWhat\u2019s Next in Payments: Secret Agent.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a lot different from using an AI agent to plan your vacation in Paris,\u201d McCall added.\nMeanwhile, research by PYMNTS Intelligence finds trust issues are holding back businesses from using agentic AI, with 80% of high-automation enterprises citing data security and privacy as their chief concern with the technology.\n\u201cUnlike traditional automation tools, agentic systems may involve dynamic decision-making across multiple systems, requiring permissions and credentials that can span departments or functions,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cMisconfigurations, insufficient access controls, or opaque decision paths can elevate the likelihood of a data breach or policy violation.\u201d\nRamp\u2019s Series E-2 funding round was led by Iconiq, which is also reportedly leading Anthropic\u2019s latest fundraising effort which would value that AI startup at $170 billion.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "With ongoing inflation and rising costs taking their toll, many small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) face increasing business costs. Many SMBs look to outside financing to address their needs to run their business and position themselves for growth. Despite the availability of multiple options, access to credit remains a challenge, leaving many vulnerable to closure.\nAs of July 2023, 47% of SMBs generating annual revenues of $10 million or less they had access to business or personal financing. The share with access to financing varies depending on the market sector. These businesses are most likely to use corporate credit cards, yet just 28% can access them. Access to corporate cards also varies by industry, though rates are low across all sectors we studied. Currently, one-quarter hope to increase their use of credit products. Thirty-five percent use corporate cards to help grow their businesses. This suggests that financial institutions (FIs) that meet their desire for more credit products, including corporate cards, could also benefit.\nChallenges related to accessing corporate credit cards affect SMBs of different sizes. To better understand the scope of these challenges, we look at smaller SMBs \u2014 those generating $10 million or less in annual revenues \u2014 and larger SMBs, which annually generate between $50 million and $250 million.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Next in Credit: Why SMBs Prefer Corporate Credit Cards for Short-Term Financing,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence and Cross River collaboration, examines the challenges SMBs face in accessing credit to support and grow their businesses. This study explores SMBs\u2019 preference for corporate credit cards for short-term financing.\nWe sourced data from Main Street Health Q2 2023: Credit\u2019s Key Role in SMBs\u2019 Plans, Main Street Health Q3 2023 and the Growth Corporates Working Capital Index. For Main Street Health Q2 2023, we surveyed 514 firms generating $10 million or less in annual revenue between April 10 and April 28. In Main Street Health Q3 2023, we surveyed 509 firms generating $10 million or less between July 5 and July 21. For the Growth Corporates Working Capital Index, we surveyed 873 firms generating between $50 million and $1 billion between March 9 and June 12.\nKey Findings\nWith just 47% of smaller SMBs having readily available financing sources, insufficient access to credit represents a key challenge and leaves them vulnerable.\nAccessing the financing needed to run and grow their businesses remains challenging. It often puts these businesses in danger of closure. As of July 2023, just 47% of SMBs had access to business or personal financing. Moreover, the share with access varies depending on the market sector. For example, the professional services and personal and consumer services sectors are less likely than the average to have access to financing. Just 43% of professional services SMBs have ready access to financing, as do 38% of personal and consumer services SMBs.\nMeanwhile, 48% in the construction or utilities industry have access to business or personal financing. Forty-five percent in hospitality have access. This difference suggests that those providing services are less likely to need funds to purchase products compared to sectors such as construction or utilities and hospitality.\nEven though corporate cards are the most common business financing, just 28% of smaller SMBs can access them.\nSmaller SMBs have access to multiple sources of personal and business financing. These businesses use corporate cards the most often \u2014 but just slightly more than personal credit cards. Even so, the share that have access to or use corporate cards is small, as just 28% do so. Twenty-seven percent say the same about personal credit cards. Access to corporate cards varies substantially by industry, with rates low across all market sectors. Construction or utilities SMBs, at 32%, have higher rates of corporate card usage than average. The same goes for retail firms, at 29%. Again, personal and consumer services and professional services firms have lower rates than average, at 20% and 24%, respectively.\nRelatively few smaller SMBs have access to other types of business financing. While 13% have access to business loans from online vendors, 11% have access to working capital loans from banks. Just 6.6% have access to equipment financing. That so few SMBs can access business financing suggests it may be difficult to qualify in today\u2019s economic environment.\nTwenty-five percent of SMBs hope to increase the use of credit products soon, but many challenges stand in their way.\nDespite the low usage of corporate credit cards among SMBs today, card issuers have a growing market opportunity. In fact, 25% of SMBs plan to increase their use of credit products in the next year. Moreover, 52% consider business credit cards when thinking about potential sources of financing to use. This share is more than other possible sources, such as business loans from online lenders, at 22%, or working capital loans from banks, at 21%.\nFinally, 41% say corporate credit cards are the financing source they will most likely to use in the next year. This sentiment indicates that many of these businesses want to avoid relying on personal credit cards for growth.\nA variety of obstacles stand between SMBs and increased corporate card usage, however. For instance, 49% of SMBs generating annual revenues between $50 million and $250 million said the top reason they have not used a corporate or virtual card in the last 12 months was cost. Ten percent of these firms cited eligibility criteria as the top obstacle, while 5.7% cited the length of the approval process. For 6.7% of these larger SMBs, the greatest barrier to corporate card use was the complicated application process. That SMBs face such frictions when accessing business credit indicates that card issuers are missing out on this opportunity by not easing SMBs\u2019 access.\nIncreasing access would help FIs take advantage of SMBs\u2019 desire for more corporate cards. This access would benefit these firms, as 35% of SMBs using corporate cards do so to help grow their businesses.\nUsing corporate credit cards as a working capital solution helps SMBs cover expected and unexpected expenses. In fact, 92% of larger SMBs that used corporate or virtual credit cards as a working capital solution in the last 12 months did so to pay for predictable expenses, while 78% did so to pay for unexpected expenses. When considering unexpected expenses, 43% use corporate cards to cover emergency expenses, 27% do so to cover payable shortfalls and 19% to cover receivable shortfalls. Among predictable expenses, 54% used corporate cards to meet cash flow needs, while 30% did so to buy inventory or services.\nCorporate credit card usage as working capital can provide countless benefits. For instance, those using cards to pay suppliers or for services can get interest-free access to working capital, with payments lagging behind spending by 30 to 60 days. They can also carry a revolving balance if cash flows are tight. Those on the supplier side can instantly receive their payments, avoiding inefficient accounts payable processes and lag with typical net 30 days or longer payment terms. Suppliers also benefit from nearly instant access to funds and relevant transaction data.\nThirty-five percent also use corporate cards to grow their businesses \u2014 a sign that corporate cards are crucial to long-term success, providing FIs with a not-to-be-missed business opportunity.\nConclusion\nSMBs in all market sectors continue to face serious challenges when accessing the credit that is so crucial for their success. In the current economic environment, the risk of closure remains an all-too-common reality for many. Because they have difficulty accessing the business financing they need, some rely on corporate credit cards. However, this financing option is out of reach for many due to the cost and frictions faced when applying for corporate cards. This is unfortunate, as they rely on corporate cards to cover expected and unexpected expenses and grow their businesses. In fact, FIs that issue corporate credit cards are missing out on a huge business opportunity.\nAs SMBs have been less able to access funding from traditional banks, FinTech has an opportunity to step up and fill the gap. Such alternative business credit sources can be nimble enough to improve these businesses\u2019 access to financing solutions while managing risk.\nMethodology\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Next in Credit: Why SMBs Prefer Corporate Credit Cards for Short-Term Financing,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence and Cross River collaboration, examines the challenges SMBs face when accessing lines of credit to support and grow their businesses.\nWe sourced data from \u201cMain Street Health Q2 2023: Credit\u2019s Key Role in SMBs\u2019 Plans,\u201d \u201cMain Street Health Q3 2023\u201d and \u201cThe Growth Corporates Working Capital Index.\u201d For Main Street Health Q2 2023, we surveyed 514 firms generating $10 million or less in annual revenue between April 10 and April 28. For Main Street Health Q3 2023, we surveyed 509 firms generating $10 million or less in annual revenue between July 5 and July 21. For the Growth Corporates Working Capital Index, we surveyed 873 firms generating between $50 million and $1 billion in annual revenue between March 9 and June 12."

As part of the revamp, the Brex Accounting Partnership Program added new product experiences, services and dedicated programs for accounting professionals.\nBrex also teamed up with Navan in October to launch a new joint offering for enterprises that streamlines travel payments into one workflow when using the Navan travel management system. With the combination of Navan\u2019s travel services and Brex\u2019s global corporate cards, BrexPay for Navan provides an integrated business travel and payments solution.\nIn September, Brex launched an embedded payments solution designed to make it easy for B2B software vendors to accelerate customer workflows with Brex virtual cards.

Its comprehensive approach has all of these cloud security solutions built in.\nWhen Wiz says it's\ncritical \u2014 it actually is.\nWiz security graph\nBlock your most critical attack paths and protect your sensitive assets\nThe Wiz Security Graph provides straightforward, context-driven insights into critical exposure.\nfeedback\nSee what our users think about Wiz\nWiz Code helps us make decisions based on contextualized data and takes the guesswork out of secure development.\nWe had a very smooth experience and easy implementation process, starting from the initial contact up, through understanding our needs, up to configuring the services to adress exactly the specific needs that we had. It integrated flawlessly with our tech stack. We use the services every day. Fully recommend!\nIt does exactly what it promises to do. Simple and agentless to set up and integrate, zero operational impact when using it, amazing metrics out of the box and all issues found are explained well and concisly, allowing any secureity team member to use the info effectively. Also, it is continually being improved.\nIt is indeed a remarkable success story! In a short period of time we achieved a transformational impact on the security posture of the entire public cloud ecosystem. That was supercharged by consistent automation, streamlined processes and communication. We are excited to continue this partnership and drive further innovation in the future!\nThe integrated view and attack path analysis capabilities Wiz provides helps enable our security and development teams to narrow down which areas they should focus on, avoiding alert fatigue. These insights help them collaborate effectively on prioritizing and remediating risks to secure our growing cloud estate.\nBy streamlining our security operations with Wiz, we\u2019ve successfully achieved a 0 failure of remediation SLA while still maintaining developer velocity.\nWiz allowed us to give solid proof to the regulator auditors, clients, and investors, proving that we actually are as good as we say we are. We can illustrate that we meet requirements around security.\nWiz is a rare tool that delivers more value than what is promised, without needing a complex set up or expensive professional services to get right. Take 5 minutes to set up, and you are getting visibility no other tool in the market can give.\nUsing Wiz you can focus on the most important vulnerabilities, those that are exposed to Internet and have an exploit in the wild. And you can do that with only few clicks using Graph Explorer.\nYou never know what the next Log4J is going to be. With Wiz, I can monitor patterns before they get too big to handle. I can review top emerging vulnerabilities, see how many systems we have that may be impacted, and share my findings with our security champions through internal Slack channels to get ahead of threats\nWiz has proven to be an invaluable asset in our cybersecurity toolkit.\nMulti-cloud enablement is at the heart of our transformation strategy and security is paramount. Wiz helps us visualize our entire cloud environment and drive actionable insights, in minutes. They\u2019ve made cloud security an enabler for Morgan Stanley and helped us break down the barriers between security and development teams.\nThere's a really damn good reason they blast off the edges up-and right on quadrants in their space -- it's not even close out there in practice. From documentation, to UX, to feature deployment, to sales, to support, and beyond, the Wiz team is crushing it every day for us and isn't just one of the best vendors I have today, but have ever had.\nThere was no technology in the industry that could provide the level of detail that Wiz does.\nWiz\u2019s agentless solution was able to get us 100% coverage quickly and at scale. Wiz gives us the contextual view of risks in our environment so we can properly understand and prioritize them based on our knowledge of what\u2019s critical.\nFinally a tool that actually gives you the data you need and functional processes.\nA \"MUST HAVE\" Tool in any CISO Stack: Holistic approach, high-quality visibility, reliable and effective. I consider it the most effective tool in my security stack.\nWiz stands out in the crowded CNAAP and CSPM market due to its innovative graph-based approach to security, ruthless prioritization of critical risks, and ability to provide comprehensive visibility across numerous cloud environments. Not only do these key features allow us to identify and remediate vulnerabilities more efficiently than with traditional tools, but Wiz's agentless architecture and intuitive interface make it remarkably easy to deploy and manage across our complex infrastructure. Within a short time frame, we achieved full visibility without any operational overhead, allowing our security team to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities and address them promptly.\nWiz enables us to get more visibility to more teams with more context than we\u2019ve ever had.\nWiz is beyond impressive -- it is a game changer.\nWIZ is changing the play ground, allowing great visibility, and consistent proactiveness to support required new challenges and threats with a solid supporting team.\nWiz has changed the definition of a fine cloud security tool. I have not seen any cloud security tools capable of doing what wiz does with maximum accuracy. Wiz is straightforward to deploy and presents the findings in a way which makes it really easier for us to focus on severe and critical issues first.\nI think Wiz is changing the industry. If you use clouds and you\u2019re scaling, and you don\u2019t have Wiz, you\u2019re in trouble.\nI\u2019ve never posted about a product before, but the amount of visibility Wiz can give you with almost no set up is game changing.\nWiz has paid for the five years subscription in a matter of one week.\nEvery single person we\u2019ve worked with at Wiz has been helpful, personable, and responsive. Wiz\u2019s team has been invaluable in our success, and the support has been excellent.\nI like Wiz because it elevates my security to the next level. Its advanced features and user-friendly interface provide comprehensive protection and ensure that my data and systems are always secure. With Wiz, I have peace of mind knowing that my security measures are robust and reliable.\nWiz gives us a common language between security and engineering. It's one tool that everybody has access to, it\u2019s super intuitive, and it\u2019s easy to leverage because the context we need to work together and do our jobs is all in one place.\nWiz has been a game-changer for our hospital's cloud security strategy. Its comprehensive visibility, real-time alerting capabilities, and user-friendly interface have markedly improved our ability to secure our cloud infrastructure.\nWiz gives us visibility across our entire cloud stack and provides deeper and broader context on the risks in our environment to prioritize addressing the issues that matter.\nOne of the best security solutions I have ever used.\nWiz - much better than the rest!\nWiz provides me as a CISO a clear risk-based view of the product lines and divisions I protect. When I advise security leaders of cloud-native / cloud-reliant companies I implore them to explore Wiz, from my perspective this is a required tool in every CISOs toolkit.\nSharing research... \ud83d\udc4f ...results \ud83d\ude0d ...methodology Thank you @wiz_io , you rock!\nWiz is leading the way! Happy customer.\nWiz is allowing our organization to make sense of the highly dynamic and extremely complex multi-cloud environment that is at the base of our infrastructure. Without Wiz, we could never hope to continuously and automatically detect security issues and vulnerabilities as they materialize in our environment.\nI am able to prioritize with Wiz with no effort from my part and most importantly I can customize the rules to fit my organization perfectly with unmatched granularity.\nWe were able to get 100+ findings from Wiz within 2 days of deployment, compared to an individual needing 6 months to deliver that type of information. The time to value and saving at least one headcount is a huge ROI for us.\nAmazing job @wiz_io First CosmosDB and now PostgreSQL ! \ud83d\udd25\nChaosDB vulnerability from @wiz_io team is such an amazing bug, you guys should get more than 100k bounty for this level of severity. Thanks for the clear explanation and the walk through of your researcher mindset. Admirable!!! \ud83d\udc4f\nNew Sheriff in Town: Wiz makes addressing cloud security issues much easier than any other tool I have ever utilized.\nI firmly believe that Wiz is worth the hype. The product has given us significantly improved visibility into our cloud security posture - and after only a few conversations/demos, it was clear that Wiz was at least two years ahead of other products in the market (including the native cloud vendor tools!)\nWiz strikes the right balance between providing high-level visibility into our whole cloud posture and giving engineers the hands-on capabilities to resolve issues on the ground. Wiz allows us to scale the cybersecurity team's reach through technology.\nNobody beats the wiz!\nOne of the best Cloud Security products on the market: Their customer success teams are fantastic and are always very responsive and helpful.\nWiz demonstrates the future of cloud security tools. Wiz avoids the pitfalls of overt complexity, providing a best-in-class security risk management platform that is simple to deploy, easy to navigate and affordable, whilst at the same time providing complete visibility of your cloud technology stack.\nSeeing the risks and findings mapped to the different certifications in Wiz really helps me focus and prioritize my work.\nThe most valued goal for cybersecurity is first frictionless visibility, That one sentence describes Wiz extremely well. Well done Wiz!\nWiz stands on top of the CSPM mountain!\nIf you have a sizeable cloud presence, you should be considering @wiz_io\nIn the competitive environment, Wiz has no real competitors. We migrated from first-generation CSPM into wiz with the combined CSPM, CIEM and Vulnerability management and were hugely impressed. The fidelity of the results was a big organizational win and allowed us to prioritize what matters.\nWiz has helped us identify some of the poor practices and approaches we have been taking when using cloud services. Since using wiz, we have been able to address significant concerns, educate our engineering teams on best practices, and take a more secure approach to leverage the cloud for our needs.\nWhat stood out about Wiz for me was it has a very intuitive interface and a really simple dashboard. The fact that it's cloud native and agentless meant we could have it up and running in a matter of minutes and have clear, actionable information\nSometimes, ignorance is bliss\u2014say, deliberately not checking this week's performance of your retirement account \ud83d\udcb8. When it comes to cloud computing \u2601\ufe0f and protecting Stanford data \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcbb however, it can be devastating. You just can't not know. Our team will soon be putting powerful tools \u26a1\ufe0f with actionable insights \ud83d\udea8 in the hands of our campus cloud technologists. \ud83c\udf32\nEveryone's time is valuable. Don't let your security posture suffer while trying to sort through a spreadsheet export with 3500 rows. Wiz measures risk along multiple dimensions: vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, clear-text secrets, internet exposure, and available script-kiddie exploits to help you zero in on the most important items to resolve immediately.\nAfter using similar systems and leading tools in the market to protect our cloud, we moved to this tool and we can't stop admiring its endless capabilities. It centers several tools under it in an amazingly easy user-friendly and clear way and one of its great pros is that it's agentless. Excellent and available support and perfect documentation.\nWiz was really the first platform we saw where getting visibility across our entire environment was a one and done set up.\nWiz is the fastest SaaS company to $100M in ARR and $200M in ARR, and has changed how security intelligence is acted upon with a unique data architecture. When you impress Igor Tsyganskiy, you're doing something very right\nWiz is the clear leader in CNAPP/CSPM\nn the realm of cloud security, finding a tool that combines both power and simplicity is paramount. My favourite tool, Wiz, exemplifies this by offering an exceptional feature known as Security Graphs. This innovative feature sets Wiz apart in the cybersecurity landscape, offering an intuitive yet profoundly effective way to visualize and manage cloud security.\nDon't just take our word for it\n\u201c There was no technology in the industry that could provide the level of detail that Wiz does. \u201d\nDon't just take our word for it\n\u201c Because of Wiz, we\u2019ve been able to democratize our approach to cybersecurity.
