      "text": "My late mother-in-law, Grace, loved crossword puzzles. I absolutely believe it helped keep her mind active well into her 80s. I don't have the patience to do her favorite, the full-on New York Times crossword puzzle, most days, but I always have time for the Mini Crossword. It's super satisfying to finish off a puzzle and hear the little triumphant music, and see how long it took you to complete it.\nMy fastest completion so far is 14 seconds. I nailed that because I knew all the ACROSS answers instantly, and the way the grid was designed that day, simply answering them filled in the DOWN squares. Now, I make it a goal to finish the puzzle in under a minute whenever I can -- though I feel most proud when I do it in under 30 seconds! That's only happened a few times.\nIf you're stumped, click here for today's Mini Crossword hints, as well as our daily answers and hints for The New York Times Wordle, Strands, Connections, and Connections: Sports Edition puzzles.\nHere are some tips and tricks for solving The New York Times Mini Crossword.\nRead more: Wordle Player Cheat Sheet: Most Popular Letters\nSolve out of order\nGlance at the clues and go straight for the ones you definitely know. As with any crossword puzzle, once you fill in a few answers, you'll have letters to help you solve the more difficult ones.\nLook for repeated or related clues\nThe New York Times Mini Crossword loves related clues, just like the big crossword puzzle does. Example: a recent Mini Crossword had two clues that were both \"Apple product.\" But one related to apples that you eat (CIDER) and the other to computer products (MAC). When you see a repeated clue, open up your mind to all the meanings.\nRead more: Everything I Learned Playing Wordle for 1 Year\nDesktop over mobile\nI do most everything on my phone, but I'm just going to say it: It's much easier to do The New York Times Mini Crossword on a large laptop or desktop screen than on a small phone screen.\nRead more: Learn From the 5 Toughest Connections Puzzles So Far\nOne-answer-only clues are your friend\nSome crossword clues are real stumpers. They're vague enough that numerous words could fit the bill. (\"Best of the best\" turned out to be \"elite\" recently, but it could have been \"champ\" or something similar.) But others have only one possible answer -- look for clues like that. Example: \"Author of The Shining\" can only be STEPHEN or KING.\nRead more: Hints to Win at Strands\nDon't be afraid of wrong answers\nEven though I recommend going for the easy clues first, if you aren't sure of an answer, fill in your guess. Just always be aware that it's a guess. Once the other answers around it start to fill in, it's easy enough to change it -- there's no eraser needed online.\nNot all answers are one word\nYou'll soon pick up on some of the Mini Crossword's own little oddities. One example: Not all answers are a single word. In a recent puzzle, the clue was \"am not!\" and the answer, of course, was also two words. And don't get stuck on one answer. I assumed the response to \"am not!\" was \"are too!\" but instead, it was \"are so!\"\nGoogle if you must\nYes, you can Google answers if you're stuck. Maybe you can't remember the title of the third Game of Thrones book, because honestly, most readers know the titles but not in the exact order. There's no honor code in puzzles, except whatever code you set up for yourself."
