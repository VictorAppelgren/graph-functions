      "summary": "The average advertised rent in the UK hit a record £1,577 per month in August, up 3% from a year earlier, driven by constrained supply and a 27% drop in available homes since 2019. London remains the most expensive market, while the North East is the cheapest. Rent growth is fastest in the north‑west, rising about 10% YoY, and slowest in London at 2%.",
