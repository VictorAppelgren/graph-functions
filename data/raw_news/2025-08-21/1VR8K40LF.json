  "content": "Feel that pit in your stomach? It may be the stress of \"The Pitt\" Season 2's impending return.\n\nThe adrenaline-pumping medical show, which charmed fans with its \"ER\" reminiscent style, is back for more after its inaugural season. A new teaser, out Aug. 21, shows lead doctor Michael \"Robby\" Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) clocking in for a new shift at the fictional Pittsburgh hospital that serves as backdrop for \"The Pitt.\"\n\nWithout giving away much plot, the trailer offers a series of quickly strung together scenes, showing the staff dealing with various medical emergencies as pressure mounts.\n\nSeason 2 of the series, which streams on HBO Max, will drop in January.\n\nLauded as a realistic portrait of the challenging circumstances American medical workers face post-pandemic, \"The Pitt\" is a strong Emmy contender this year. Rather than chronicle months in its characters' lives, the show's entire first season took place over the course of one day.\n\nWyle, who also starred in \"ER,\" previously told USA TODAY that putting the stethoscope back around his neck for \"The Pitt\" felt nostalgic.\n\n\"I didn't know that a prop could ever be endowed with as much muscle memory and history as a stethoscope for me,\" he said. \"But it's true. It's just weird.\"",

      "text": "George Clooney gives his real thoughts of former 'ER' costar Noah Wyle's 'The Pitt'\n\"The Pitt\" officially has the Doug Ross seal of approval.\nIn an appearance on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" George Clooney shared his thoughts on the acclaimed medical drama series from Max, which stars his former \"ER\" colleague Noah Wyle.\n\"It's so good,\" Clooney said of \"The Pitt,\" going on to heap praise on Wyle.\n\"I have to say, we've been really dear friends since the show, since we did the pilot of the show. He is just the most honorable, talented young man \u2014 I get to say, because I'm an old man \u2014 and I cannot be happier for his success on the show. The show is just a beautiful show, and he does a great job with it.\"\nWyle stars as Dr. Michael \"Robby\" Robinavitch on \"The Pitt,\" a medical drama set in a Pittsburgh hospital's emergency room. Every episode chronicles one hour in the hospital, with the full first season telling the story of one shift. The series was created by former \"ER\" writer R. Scott Gemmill and is produced by former \"ER\" producer John Wells.\nIn 2024, the estate of \"ER\" creator Michael Crichton sued Warner Bros. over the show, alleging that it originated as an \"ER\" reboot that was rebranded as \"The Pitt\" following unsuccessful negotiations with the estate. Warner Bros. Television slammed the lawsuit as \"baseless,\" describing \"The Pitt\" as a \"new and original show.\" The series has been renewed for a second season.\nSpeaking to USA TODAY in January, Wyle said \"The Pitt\" was intentionally made to be distinct from \"ER,\" explaining, \"Once we weren't going to remake 'ER,' nobody wanted to remake 'ER.' It was that simple. Not for litigious reasons but for creative reasons. If we can't do it, then let's not, and let's see what that leads us to.\"\nClooney famously starred as Doug Ross on \"ER,\" which aired from 1994 to 2009 and also starred Wyle as John Carter. Clooney, who left the show in 1999, earned two Emmy nominations for the role.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Tonight in March, Wyle said he and his former \"ER\" costars \"all do keep in touch.\" In April, Wyle and \"ER\" alums Julianna Margulies and Anthony Edwards turned out to support Clooney at the opening night of his Broadway show \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\""

We're discussing key plot points in the latest episode of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d (streaming now), so beware if you haven\u2019t seen it.\nModern television is saturated with medical dramas.\nIn a craze kicked off by shows like \"E.R.\" and \"St. Elsewhere\" and elevated to a fever pitch by \"Grey's Anatomy,\" it may seem hard for any of the scrubbed-in series to offer new shock value. But last night's episode of \"The Pitt\" proved otherwise.\nThe emergency room drama, which has hooked audiences from its premiere in January, stunned fans with Episode 10. After new revelations led to Dr. Frank Langdon's ouster, loyal viewers reacted with shock and dismay.\nDr. Langdon's secret on 'The Pitt,' social media reacts\nDr. Langdon, a fan-favorite principal on the show, was revealed to be self-medicating in the latest episode, stealing prescription painkillers from his own patients.\n\"Last episode they showed us Langdon was being overly aggressive and it was still excused by viewers as 'necessary.'\" one X user wrote in response to the revelation. \"They showed us the vial was suspicious and we excused it as Santos holding a grudge when she's clearly had experience around addicts. I'm so gagged.\"\n\"I wanted Dr Santos to be wrong soooo bad omg. Dr Langdon nooooooo,\" another post read.\nIn a play on a viral \"America's Next Top Model\" moment, another X user also took aim at Dr. Langdon. \"I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU! I WAS ON YOUR SIDE!!!! I WAS STARTING TO THINK SANTOS WAS CRAZY!!!\" they wrote. \"LANGDON I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!!!!!\"\n\"How dare #ThePitt make me fall in love with the most beautiful man I have ever seen in the entire world and then make me hate him?!\" one user wrote.\nDr. Langdon's reveal surprised 'Pitt' cast, too\nTurns out, fans weren't the only ones shocked by that Dr. Langdon reveal.\nPatrick Ball, who plays Langdon, revealed show writers kept the secret even from him, in an interview with Deadline published Thursday.\n\"Langdon was described to me as this doctor everybody loves,\" Ball told the outlet. \"And then it was brought to my attention later in the process what Langdon might be carrying secretly, what he might be going through secretly.\"\n\"It was cool that I didn't start with that information, I didn't start off by trying to create a character who was trying to send up signals of addiction or trauma or anxiety or whatever,\" he continued. \"I started discovering Langdon through his sense of play and his sense of fun and his sense that he loves this job. The underbelly came in later.\""

      "text": "Noah Wyle: I play a doctor on 'The Pitt.' Real health care workers need our help.\nSince 'The Pitt' premiered, I've heard from health care workers who said they finally feel seen. Their stories echo the same themes: Exhaustion, compassion and a system that threatens their work.\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of my life wearing scrubs, although I never passed Anatomy 101.\nOn \"The Pitt,\" I play an attending physician in a high-intensity emergency department. It\u2019s fiction, but it\u2019s grounded in real stories \u2013 shaped by medical advisers who've lived them and delivered with reverence for the professionals we\u2019re honored to represent.\nStill, it wasn\u2019t until my mother, a retired nurse, watched a scene where my character lists the names of patients he couldn\u2019t save that I truly grasped the emotional weight of this work, as she shared a flood of stories she\u2019s carried silently for decades. I\u2019ve never seen her respond that way to something I\u2019ve acted in.\nAnd she\u2019s not alone. Since the show premiered, I\u2019ve heard from countless health care workers who\u2019ve told me they finally feel seen. Their stories echo the same themes: exhaustion, compassion and a system that threatens to make their life\u2019s work unsustainable.\nTheir stories have stayed with me. And that\u2019s why I jumped at the chance when I was approached by FIGS, a health care apparel company with a history of standing up for the health care workforce, to go to Capitol Hill with them this week. While on Capitol Hill, I will advocate alongside a group of FIGS ambassadors made up of 18 extraordinary nurses, doctors, students and other health care professionals.\nHealth care workers need help from Congress\nAs part of this grassroots effort, we\u2019re urging lawmakers to act on three urgent, bipartisan issues that are making health care workers\u2019 jobs, and their lives, harder than they need to be: lack of mental health support, crushing administrative burden and financial strain.\nOur message is simple: Without a supported, protected and fairly treated workforce, there is no patient care. Whatever other important issues are being debated, this has to be a priority.\nHealth care workers are experiencing burnout at staggering levels. Half of physicians and nurses report being burned out, and health care workers face a 32% higher risk of suicide than the general population. Even when support exists, many fear that seeking help could jeopardize their license, career or reputation.\nThat issue has hit home for many of the health care professionals who will join me in Washington. One nurse said she struggled with depression and anxiety due to the conditions at work and came close to taking her own life. A doctor described dental students whose teeth were ground away by stress. And an oncology nurse shared the heartbreaking story of a young cancer patient who died because of the paperwork delays in getting him the lifesaving medication he needed.\nThat\u2019s why one of our priorities is reauthorization and funding of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which includes federal mental health programs for health care workers as well as grants for peer support, training and institutional culture change, especially in rural and underserved areas.\nThe law was enacted in 2022 on a nearly unanimous bipartisan basis. But unfortunately, it expired in 2024. It should now be reauthorized with just as much support as it received initially.\nPrior authorization threatens patients' health\nAt the same time, administrative red tape is strangling the system. Physicians and their staff spend nearly two full business days each week dealing with prior authorization \u2013 essentially asking insurance companies for permission to treat their patients.\nOne ambassador, a primary care provider, told us she spends nearly half her day fighting insurance denials and filling out duplicative forms \u2013 far more time than she spends with patients.\nThese delays don\u2019t just cause frustration: 1 in 4 physicians say prior authorization has led to serious patient harm. We\u2019re urging Congress to move forward with reforms that help put clinical judgment back where it belongs: in the hands of trained professionals.\nAnd then there\u2019s pay. Fewer than 6 in 10 health care workers feel fairly compensated, and only 38% see any link between their performance and their paycheck.\nThat disconnect is pushing people out of the field and fueling dangerous shortages.\nAnother ambassador, a resident physician, described working 80-hour weeks while struggling to afford groceries. Stories like hers are why FIGS is championing the Awesome Humans Act, a proposed federal tax credit to provide frontline health care workers with meaningful financial relief.\nThese aren\u2019t partisan issues. They\u2019re practical ones. And they\u2019re urgent. Because when our health care professionals are burned out, buried in paperwork or forced to leave the field altogether, we all pay the price.\nI\u2019m not a policymaker. I\u2019m not a clinician. But I\u2019ve spent my career listening to those who are, and I\u2019ve seen the difference they make when it matters most: after a car accident, during cancer treatment, in delivery rooms and at the end of life.\nThis week, I\u2019ll stand with them in the halls of Congress, and I\u2019ll be proud to do it with my mom and 18 other amazing health care workers.\nTo anyone who\u2019s ever benefited from the knowledge, care and courage of a health care professional, now\u2019s the time to show up for them and take action. They\u2019ve had our backs. It\u2019s time we have theirs.\nNoah Wyle is an actor, writer, producer and director who currently stars in \u201cThe Pitt.\u201d"

      "text": "Michael Crichton estate sues Warner Bros., claims new show 'The Pitt' is an 'ER' ripoff\nWarner Bros. Television has been hit with a lawsuit that claims its upcoming medical drama \"The Pitt\" is essentially an unofficial \"ER\" reboot.\nThe estate of late author Michael Crichton, who created the medical drama series \"ER,\" has filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. Television in California, according to a copy of the complaint provided to USA TODAY. The suit alleges the studio attempted to negotiate with Crichton's estate to develop a reboot of \"ER\" but that when these talks were unsuccessful, producers \"simply moved the show from Chicago to Pittsburgh, rebranded it 'The Pitt,'\" and \"plowed ahead without any attribution or compensation for Crichton and his heirs.\"\nThe lawsuit alleges breach of contract and also names Noah Wyle, who is set to star in \"The Pitt,\" and producers John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill as defendants.\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY, Warner Bros. Television described the lawsuit as \"baseless,\" saying that \"The Pitt\" is a \"new and original show\" and that \"any suggestion otherwise is false, and Warner Bros. Television intends to vigorously defend against these meritless claims.\"\nThe complaint states that when Crichton sold Warner Bros. the screenplay for the pilot episode of \"ER,\" the studio agreed that no productions derived from the show would go forward without his consent. This provision \"ensured that Crichton would receive appropriate credit, and that he and his heirs would receive compensation commensurate with the ultimate success of 'ER,' in connection with any future productions,\" the suit said.\nThis is why widow of Michael Crichton chose James Patterson to finish his 'Eruption' book\nAccording to the lawsuit, the defendants began developing a reboot of \"ER\" in 2020 that would air on HBO Max, which has since been renamed Max. During subsequent negotiations, Warner Bros. Television allegedly \"reneged\" on certain terms, leading the estate to refuse to proceed. In lieu of an actual \"ER\" reboot, the suit alleges that Warner Bros. then began developing \"precisely the same series\" under a different title.\n20 years ago, 'ER' gave Clooney's career shot in the arm\nIn March, Max gave a straight-to-series order to \"The Pitt,\" a medical drama series described as a \"realistic examination of the challenges facing healthcare workers in today's America as seen through the lens of the frontline heroes working in a modern-day hospital in Pittsburgh.\" \"ER\" was set at a hospital in Chicago. \"The Pitt\" will star Wyle and be produced by R. Scott Gemmill and John Wells, all of whom worked on \"ER.\"\n\"'The Pitt' is 'ER,'\" the suit alleges. \"It's not like 'ER,' it's not kind of 'ER,' it's not sort of 'ER.' It is 'ER' complete with the same executive producer, writer, star, production companies, studio, and network as the planned 'ER' reboot.\"\nThe lawsuit also alleges that this was part of an attempt to deny Crichton a \"created by\" credit and profit from his creation \"without paying his heirs a single penny,\" claiming, \"Defendants seek not to bury Crichton's credit but to erase him altogether and to rob his heirs of the fruits of one of his greatest creations.\"\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY, a spokesperson for Sherri Crichton, the author's widow and guardian of the estate, accused Warner Bros. of \"bullying tactics and complete disregard for its legal obligations, Crichton, and his fans,\" adding, \"If Warner Bros. can do this to Michael Crichton, one of the industry's most successful and prolific creators who made the studio billions over the course of their partnership, no creator is safe.\"\n\"ER\" ran on NBC from 1994 to 2009 and was based on a 1974 screenplay written by Crichton titled \"Emergency Ward.\" The author, who was credited as the creator of \"ER,\" died from cancer in 2008 at age 66. More than a decade later, James Patterson finished a manuscript by Crichton, which was published as the novel \"Eruption\" earlier this year."

      "text": "\u2018The Pitt\u2019 Season 2 will take on Trump policy changes such as Medicaid cuts, ICE raids\nWith Season 2 production already underway, the creative team behind \"The Pitt\" is promising that the acclaimed medical drama will continue to tackle real-world situations faced by patients and healthcare workers including ICE raids and new cuts to Medicaid spending imposed by the Trump administration.\nIn an interview with Variety published Aug. 7, series star Noah Wyle and executive producers John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill confirmed that the sophomore season will integrate the passing of President Donald Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" into storylines.\nSigned into law on July 4, the legislation cuts nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending and is expected to eliminate insurance coverage for 11.8 million people over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nWells defended the decision adding that writers do not need to take a political stance to discuss how the changes to Medicaid are going to impact the healthcare industry, Variety reported. He acknowleged that changes have been critcized by some GOP officials like Republican U.S. Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri, who on July 15 introduced a bill that would repeal some of the cuts to rural hospitals.\n\"I don\u2019t want to have an argument about whether or not they\u2019re appropriate, what Congress did or didn\u2019t do. But they\u2019re going to have on-the-ground, immediate consequences in emergency rooms, and nobody\u2019s arguing with that. That\u2019s a bipartisan agreement,\" Wells told the outlet. \"You\u2019ve got very Republican senators from Missouri like Josh Hawley agreeing that this is going to be a problem.\"\nWells added that he believes many are apathetic toward healthcare workers due to a lack of awareness about the pressures they regularly face in the medical system. Both Wyle and Gemmill argued that the \"ignorance\" toward healthcare workers comes from \"the highest levels\" of the U.S. government, the outlet reported.\nTeam spoke with hundreds of medical professionals\nThe show's creative team has spoke with hundreds of medical professionals to predict the immediate concerns hospitals can start facing as soon as next year, Variety reported.\nWyle said that by portraying the real intricacies of the medical system, viewers can determine for themselves whether it is \"untenable, unfair and skewed towards one population over another.\"\n\"We have a certain safety net in just being a realistic drama by trying to depict what it looks like in a hospital,\" he told the outlet. \"You\u2019re not making value judgments. You\u2019re just painting a picture, and if it\u2019s accurate enough and it\u2019s representative enough, it becomes a bit of a Rorschach test. You see what you want to see in it and you draw your own conclusions from it.\"\nSeason to also portray treatment of undocumented families\nIn addition to Medicaid cuts, Season 2 also plans to delve into the Trump administration's border crackdown and recent ICE deportations with the treatment of undocumented and immigrant families in storylines, Wyle, Wells and Gemmill told Variety.\nGemmill said the creative team feel a sense of responsibility over the content they release knowing that their first season reached an audience of more than 10 million people.\n\"We take our platform very seriously,\" he added. \"You have to be responsible for what you put out there.\"\nThe first season, which premiered in early January, tackled various social issues that healthcare workers witness in the profession from abortion, human trafficking, hate crimes, drug addiction and gun violence.\nThe series \u2013 all 15 Season 1 episodes are available for streaming \u2013 has become among HBO Max's most-watched titles globally and landed 13 Emmy nominations including one for Wyle in the best lead actor in a drama series category."

      "text": "Our obsession with 'The Pitt' and other medical shows, explained\nDr. Michael \"Robby\" Robinavitch can't save everyone in his overcrowded Pittsburgh emergency room, but maybe he can save all of us watching at home.\nPlayed with a gruff smolder by longtime medical drama veteran Noah Wyle, the hero of Max's new series \"The Pitt\" (Season 1 now streaming) stitches up wounds, pumps donated blood into veins and prescribes medicine, but inevitably he doesn't heal anything. Certainly not the broken system in which he is stuck. But there is so much solace in watching him try nonetheless.\nA \"real-time\" medical drama set over 15 hours on one very long emergency room shift, \"The Pitt\" has caught on: Fans are swooning over TikTok clips, style website The Cut is promoting fan fiction about the show and real doctors are feeling seen and validated.\nIt's not the only new medical series trying to \"stat!\" its way into our hearts this year. The TV season offers a slew of other new shows, including \"Watson\" (CBS), \"Doc\" (Fox), \"Doctor Odyssey\" (ABC), \"Brilliant Minds\" (NBC), \"St. Denis Medical\" (NBC) and \"Pulse\" (Netflix). You've got everything to go with the gritty realism of \"The Pitt,\" from a medical mystery Sherlock Holmes take (\"Watson\"), to a sitcom (\"St. Denis\"), to a ludicrous Ryan Murphy drama set on a cruise ship (\"Odyssey\").\nOf course, Hollywood trends are cyclical. For a while, there were too many vampires or zombies, and a few years ago, all the \"Game of Thrones\" wannabes drowned us in high fantasy. But the Big Three of TV procedurals \u2212 cop, lawyer and doctor shows \u2212 come around like clockwork. For the past decade or so, it's been an overload of cop shows. Now the docs are getting their turn again.\nBut it's more than just a coincidence of network bigwigs all picking up new medical shows at the same time: They've shown up at the right time to heal ailing viewers.\nAmericans have been living in unprecedented times \u2013 a very nice euphemism for constant crisis \u2013 for nearly a decade. The COVID-19 pandemic, contested elections, political chaos, natural disasters, violence, inflation, climate change: It all adds up to a burned-out population looking for some ease and comfort. And despite the blood and the gore, medical shows are distinctly comforting.\nWhen a new patient walks into Grey Sloan Memorial (on ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy\") or a Miami hospital during a hurricane (\"Pulse\") or even the infirmary on a massive cruise ship (\"Odyssey\"), professional, experienced and calm people are there to try and save them. The emergencies in these shows are contained and often solvable. There is order and procedure and grown-ups in the room to tell everyone what to do. The best thing about these medical emergencies? They're fictional. They take us away from the very real problems we don't have any idea how to solve.\nDoctors have been rushing around hospitals on TV since the 1950s, and as the camera follows them to scrub in, it can feel like going home. A whole generation of millennials is primed to be nostalgic for the medical shows of the 1990s and early 2000s, when \"ER\" and \"Grey's\" dominated our watch schedules (yes, \"Grey's\" has been on the air long enough to generate nostalgia for its early years). There is seemingly a show for each subgenre for fans of all those great 2000s series. If you liked \"ER,\" watch \"The Pitt.\" If you liked \"Grey's,\" go for romance and melodrama-heavy \"Pulse.\" If you liked the wacky medical mysteries in \"House,\" try \"Watson.\" If you want giggles like \"Scrubs,\" try \"St. Denis.\"\nMany of these shows are admirable and watchable: \"St. Denis\" is fun, \"Odyssey\" is silly, \"Watson\" is absurd and \"Pulse\" has an exciting young cast. But \"The Pitt\" is the most exciting reinvention of the genre (despite its many similarities to \"ER,\" which are too many, according to a lawsuit from the estate of \"ER\" creator Michael Crichton).\nThe \"real-time\" gimmick of \"The Pitt\" (seen earlier on Fox's \"24\") makes it even more unrelenting than all the other unrelenting shows in this genre, leaving viewers scant time to catch their breath than the fictional doctors and nurses. It's not concerned with intra-office romance so much as it is with something far more existential. Season 1's 15-hour shift (the show has already been renewed) gives us a too-perfect image of what it's like to live in America right now: Fentanyl overdoses, mass shootings, vaccine denial, the \"manosphere,\" bigotry, burnout, violence and anger. It's all wrapped up in primary colored slap bracelets to triage our national maladies from green to red: survivable to critical.\n\"The Pitt\" offers no answers, and there are moments when its overworked and underpaid health care workers want to give up hope for the souls of the patients they're treating. But they don't. They keep trying. They keep CPR compressions going. Zachary Quinto's enigmatic \"Minds\" neurologist never gives up on a patient, either, and the same goes for the cruising and handsome Dr. Max Bankman (Joshua Jackson) on \"Odyssey.\" Because while watching \"The Pitt\" or \"Watson\" or any other medical show, we want to know that there are people left in this world who will try to help even when all hope seems to be lost.\nMaybe if we see them on TV, we can find them in real life, too."

      "text": "Noah Wyle felt 'liberated' leaving 'ER' doctor John Carter behind in 'The Pitt'\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which negotiations for an \u201cER\u201d reboot ended.\nNoah Wyle is back in the emergency room for Max's \"The Pitt.\" But times have changed.\nIt's been over three decades since Wyle, 53, starred as his famed \"ER\" character Dr. John Carter, the baby-faced third-year medical student who was part of the original crew at Chicago's fictional Cook County General Hospital in NBC's 1994 premiere. At 23, he was the youngest cast member, alongside breakout stars like George Clooney, Anthony Edwards and Eriq La Salle.\nEven as Wyle left the pulse-pounding medical drama in 2005 after its 11th season, Carter \u2012 by then an attending physician \u2012 remained fresh-faced and optimistic. In \"The Pitt,\" Wyle's Dr. Michael \"Robby\" Robinavitch teeters on the edge of a breakdown as the head doctor at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. Robby's unkempt beard has flecks of gray, he wears a worn sweatshirt over scrubs, and his hair is more Supercuts than '90s superstar.\nYet every time Robby wraps that stethoscope around his neck, it's a bit of medical-drama nostalgia in a chaotic new setting. \"I didn't know that a prop could ever be endowed with as much muscle memory and history as a stethoscope for me,\" Wyle says ahead of Thursday's fourth episode (streaming at 9 EST/PST), which he wrote. \"But it's true. It's just weird.\"\nA proposed \"ER\" reboot, which included Wyle and executive producer John Wells, fell through in 2023. Wyle says he was already inspired by medical professionals reaching out during the COVID-19 pandemic to discuss their traumatic emergency room horrors. He says he \"pivoted,\" suggesting a different kind of medical show to Wells and former \"ER\" writer R. Scott Gemmill.\n\"I said, 'Hey, I know you don't really want to do the show again. I don't, either. But there's another story,'\" Wyle says. \"We recognized what we had to lose, a legacy we'd built up over 15 long years. What we had to gain was, at our ages, seeing if we could dig deep and reinvent the genre one more time.\"\n\"The Pitt\" follows Robby, inundated by patients, in real-time like Fox's \"24.\" Each episode covers one hour of a 15-hour ER shift so intense that he gets pulled away from an unfinished men's room visit for emergencies. Robby runs an airtight ship but increasingly has trouble compartmentalizing the grief from his fateful medical decisions that led to the death of his mentor during the COVID-19 crisis.\nIs Dr. Robby in 'The Pitt' related to 'ER' Dr. John Carter?\nWyle says the new show avoids links to his former role. \"It was almost counterproductive to what we were trying to do,\" he says. \"The exercise became, how can we make it even more different? I felt liberated in some ways.\"\nYet the estate of \"ER\" creator Michael Crichton filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Warner Bros. Television in August, claiming that \"The Pitt\" is \"precisely the same series\" as \"ER.\"\nThere are no Easter eggs or \"ER\" cameos in the series. Wyle \u2015 whose in-between roles included alien drama \"Falling Skies\" and a series of \"Librarian\" movies \u2015 says there's no connection between the medical dramas beyond \"John (Wells), Scott (Gemmill), me and a hospital.\"\nThe two medical shows also put \"a spotlight on this community that picks up our broken pieces every day and gets very little credit,\" Wyle says.\nAt a November media event, HBO and Max chief Casey Bloys said \"the idea that a show can\u2019t be set in an ER seems kind of unrealistic on its face.\u201d\nWyle says the differences between the two shows were made distinct for story reasons. \"Once we weren't going to remake 'ER,' nobody wanted to remake 'ER.' It was that simple,\" he says. \"Not for litigious reasons but for creative reasons. If we can't do it, then let's not, and let's see what that leads us to.\"\nShow producers have even held back from casting one actor who played a former \"ER\" paramedic from future episodes to avoid the perception of a connection. \"We all like this actor very much, and it would have been great to work again,\" says Wyle. \"But why poke the bear? It's unfortunate. And if this (lawsuit) gets cleared, and we are allowed to, then I'm sure we'd explore it.\"\nWhat happens in the episode of 'The Pitt' Noah Wyle wrote?\nWyle tapped into sentiments from a bestselling author with an Episode 4 storyline involving two adult children struggling during the final moments of their father's life. In the scene, Robby passes on the four phrases his beloved mentor taught him for end-of-life discussions: \"I love you,\" \"Thank you,\" \"I forgive you\" and \"Please forgive me.\" The inspiration came from palliative care physician and author Ira Byock, who featured the Hawaiian reconciliation practice in his 2014 book, \"The Four Things That Matter Most.\"\n\"These four simple phrases have great profundity,\" he says. \"It was lovely to weave them into the show fabric.\"\nWhen depicting the patient's emotional final moment with his grieving children, Wyle found guidance from his own mother, Marjorie Speer, a former registered orthopedic nurse.\n\"A very similar event had played out with my mother and her brother when saying goodbye to my grandfather,\" says Wyle. \"After she shared this with me, I just said 'Thank you,' went right back to my typewriter and wrote the scene. It's an homage to my mother, my uncle and my grandfather.\""
