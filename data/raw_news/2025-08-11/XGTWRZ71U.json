  "content": "ATLANTA, Aug. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- UC Asset Limited Partnership (OTCQB: UCASU) has issued a statement applauding the latest policy development from President Trump's office, as reported in an exclusive article by The Wall Street Journal on Saturday.\n\nThe report, titled \"Trump Weighs Reclassifying Marijuana as Less Dangerous Drug,\" states that \"The president told donors earlier this month he was interested in reclassifying the drug.\" This refers to the potential reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance. While this change would not fully legalize marijuana, it would significantly ease restrictions, enable tax breaks for certain cannabis companies, and open the door to expanded medical research.\n\n\"Since the beginning of this year, UC Asset has anticipated a potential policy breakthrough in the cannabis industry, and developed and executed an investment plan based on that projection,\" said Larry Wu, founder and managing partner of UC Asset.\n\nEarlier this year, UC Asset acquired more equity in cannabis properties, nearly doubled its cannabis property portfolio\u2014from $1.6 million to $3.1 million.\n\nThe company has also filed with the SEC for a $5.0 million Secondary Public Offering (SPO), with the majority of the capital earmarked for acquiring two additional cannabis properties. The offering statement has undergone two rounds of SEC review, and management remains optimistic that it will be qualified within the next few months.\n\nIn its amended Form 1-A, UC Asset reports a 14.4% Return on Investment (ROI) for its cannabis portfolio\u2014significantly above the industry average and outperforming similar portfolios held by other public companies.\n\n\"For example, Players Club Capital stated in January 2025 that 'Cap rates for (cannabis cultivation) properties typically range from 7\u201310%,'\" explained Wu.\n\n\"We also analyzed SEC filings from other public companies and estimated their ROI ranged between 11\u201312% in 2024. Based on this, our 14.4% ROI stands out.\"\n\nWu cautioned, however, that the company's interpretation of peer filings may not be exact and strongly encourages investors to conduct their own research.\n\n3. Anticipated Policy Shift Could Spark Second Wave of Industry Growth\n\nSince early 2025, UC Asset has been forecasting a second wave of growth in the cannabis industry, citing low market penetration and the sector's distance from maturity. Despite continued year-over-year growth, the industry has lost 95% of its investment equity value, as measured by the cannabis ETF index MSOS. As unfortunate a fact as it is, it also leaves huge room for the next wave of growth, once the trend gets reversed.",
