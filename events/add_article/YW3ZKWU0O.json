      "summary": "Oil prices held steady in Asian trading, maintaining gains from U.S. sanctions on a network of shipping companies linked to Iranian oil smuggling. Brent and WTI prices were largely unchanged, with Brent at $69.13 and WTI at $65.63 per barrel. Market sentiment was tempered by expectations of falling U.S. crude inventories and weak manufacturing data, which dampened demand outlook. Investors are awaiting the September 7 OPEC+ meeting, where no production cuts are expected, while U.S. tariffs continue to weigh on economic activity.",
