  "title": "Nintendo reportedly kept delaying Switch 2 because first-party devs wanted more time to perfect games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza",
  "description": "The publisher apparently wanted to give its first-party devs time to cook no matter how much it annoyed fans and third-party publishers",
  "content": "The wait for Switch 2 was nearly interminable for some Nintendo fans, especially as rumors continued trickling in that it was nearly, almost, just about ready for launch for years before it was even officially announced. A new report suggests that Nintendo repeatedly delayed its own launch plans for the new console because first-party devs wanted more time to make their games.\n\nThat's according to a new report from Bloomberg (paid article link), citing anonymous sources familiar with Nintendo's pre-launch plans for Switch 2. \"The company decided that aiming for perfection was more important\" than launching the console as soon as possible, as Bloomberg puts it, despite frustrations from both fans and third-party developers.\n\nThe specific games that devs wanted more time for aren't named here, but it's tough to imagine they can be anything but Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, the two biggest Switch 2 titles so far. While there are plenty of substantial upcoming Switch 2 games on the calendar, neither cross-gen upgrades like Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 or third-party co-developed titles like Kir Air Riders and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment can quite match the importance of a fully first-party Nintendo game.\n\nThe Bloomberg report goes on to note that Nintendo keeps an unusually high amount of cash in reserve compared to other Japanese companies, despite pressure to use that cash for stock buybacks and dividends. Nonetheless, the extra bank has helped Nintendo weather failures like the Wii U, and \"also provided a safety cushion for creators to undertake long-term projects.\"\n\nThere remain some concerns about what Nintendo's software lineup is going to look like in the near future, and even former employees have some big questions about why the company's been so reticent to provide release information on this year's major games. But if releases like Donkey Kong Bananza are any indication, the wait is probably going to be worthwhile.\n\nDon't miss any of the best Switch 2 games so far.",

      "text": "Everything we know about Nintendo Switch 2\nAll the news and details surrounding the brand-new Nintendo Switch 2\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 launch day came and went on June 5, 2025. After years of speculation, leaks, and rumors, Ninty's latest machine was finally unleashed onto the world and managed to sell 3.5 million units in the subsequent four days of release. Now, the Switch 2 has become Nintendo's fastest-selling console to date, and its new lifespan has just begun.\nThe Switch 2 has an MSRP of $450 / \u00a3395.99, and was available at launch with a Mario Kart World bundle available for $499.99 / \u00a3429.99, where it introduced 256GB of internal storage, magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers, a GameCube NSO game library, mouse controls, a bigger 7.9 inch 1080p 120Hz LCD display, and a wealth of new games, including Switch 2 Enhanced versions of older releases.\nOur hardware team's own Tabitha Baker shared in her Nintendo Switch 2 review that we're in for an \"excellent generation\" with the new handheld, and that while its battery life isn't ideal and its HDR needs a little tuning, the device is a \"leap\" from the previous Switch. Many more of us now finally have a Switch 2 of our own too, and are getting to grips with the changes from its predecessors. But with more upcoming Switch 2 games being announced all the time, we're continuing to gather every bit of news and details about the Switch 2 so you can find out the latest about Nintendo's newest machine, or decide if buying a Switch 2 is right for you.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 launch date & price\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 released worldwide on Thursday, June 5, 2025, for $450 / \u00a3395.99. At launch, both the standard console and a Mario Kart World bundle (with a digital copy of the game) were available to purchase, with the bundle costing $499.99 / \u00a3429.99, respectively.\nThe release date for the upcoming handheld was unveiled during the April 2 Nintendo Switch Direct presentation, with the price shared through official channels shortly afterward. Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders went live in the UK on April 8, 2025, just days after the April 2 Direct from the official Nintendo website and selected retailers.\nIn a likely bid to prevent resellers getting hold of the new console across the globe, the opportunity to pre-order the Switch 2 from the official My Nintendo Store was initially limited and offered on an invite-only basis to selected Nintendo Switch Online members. To be one of those lucky few, you had to match a series of criteria, which included being a Nintendo Switch Online member for at least two years continuously by March 31, 2025, and having an active NSO subscription on the day of pre-orders.\nNintendo Switch 2 Specs\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is a monumental upgrade from its predecessor inside and out, but using what we know from past Nintendo Switch 2-centered Directs, supplementary tech specs provided officially by the Nintendo website, and information provided by those directly involved in its manufacture, like Nvidia, the overall specs are:\n- 401g weight (534g with Joy-Cons attached)\n- Custom NVIDIA Ampere GPU\n- 128-bit/LPDDR5\n- 256GB internal storage\n- 7.9-inch LCD 1080p 120Hz display with 120Hz refresh rate\n- Dock with 4K and HDR (in TV mode) support\n- Magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers with mouse controls\n- MicroSD Express card reader (compatible up to 2TB)\n- Built-in microphone (with noise and echo cancellation, and auto gain control)\n- 2 \u2013 6.5 hours battery life\nOn June 2, 2025, just days before launch, Nintendo of America dropped a special edition of Creator\u2019s Voice video on its YouTube Channel, featuring Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Huang stated that the launch of the Switch 2 was a \"big moment\" for everyone at Nvidia, and that they had to \"reinvent everything\" for the brand new handheld. According to Huang, the Switch 2 chip is \"unlike anything\" they've built before, and features the most \"advanced graphics ever in a mobile device\" which includes full ray-tracing, HDR for brighter highlights and deeper shadows, and a backwards compatibility supporting architecture.\nHuang also shared that the Switch 2's chip had dedicated AI processors to sharpen and enhance gameplay in real-time, and that Nvidia optimized its semiconductor processing tech to ensure high-performance in the brand-new handheld.\nThe Digital Foundry YouTube Channel released a deeper dive into the specs of the new Switch 2, confirming that the handheld is integrated with a custom Nvidia T239 chip with an Ampere-based GPU. Digital Foundry also revealed that VRR is only available in handheld mode. As of now, the tech, which helps synchronize the frame rate of your display with the frame rate of your Switch, won't work with your gaming monitor or smart TV. The handheld also features a custom file decompression engine, designed to help improve the load times of games.\nIf you're into the nitty and gritty details, the Switch 2 CPU has a clock of 998MHz in docked mode and a 1101MHz clock in handheld mode. Meanwhile, the GPU is rated for 1007MHz docked and 561MHz in handheld mode.\nDisplay\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is armed with a larger 7.9-inch 1080p 120Hz screen with HDR abilities, while its docking station allows players to ramp things up to 4K on external gaming TV and monitors. To pull off those enhanced resolutions, the dock also has a built-in fan to keep the system cool, which makes sense, seeing as even the Steam Deck OLED and Asus ROG Ally will struggle to deliver UHD visuals in newer games.\nJust like the OLED Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 features a film layer that acts as a screen protector. Its existence on the new handheld was discovered by The Verge, and as per Nintendo's instructions in the official Switch 2 manual.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nStorage\nThe Switch 2 has 256GB of storage (with around 7GB of that being used for the operating system), which Nintendo claims is faster than the 32GB flash memory used by the original system.\nIt helps improve load times in more demanding games or existing adventures like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom Enhanced Edition. It also opens the door for bigger, bolder outings since the handheld will be able to pull data much faster than before. The caveat is that the new game cards are now simply keys that allow you access to a download, which ties in the idea of faster memory beyond the old cartridges.\nWhen it comes to additional storage, the best Nintendo Switch SD cards are not compatible with the new device, and instead, you'll have to grab one of the best Nintendo Switch 2 microSD Express cards for $49.99 / \u00a349.99 to get an additional 256GB worth of storage. Officially licensed Samsung and SanDisk 256GB Express Card available through the official Nintendo website and other retailers, which feature red Super Mario branding. However, iconic storage brands Lexar and SanDisk have 128GB and 256GB compatible cards available to purchase from select retailers.\nThe official Nintendo website states that inserting a microSD card that has been previously used on a Nintendo Switch into a Nintendo Switch 2 console will not allow you to save or load digital games or save data. That being said, you can transfer over screenshots and game captures with an older microSD card, generally, and through the system transfer process.\nJoy-Con\nThe brand new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Switch 2 are very similar to their predecessors, but feature all-black colorways with dabs of the iconic blue and red iconic Switch-branded colors poking out from around the sticks and magnetically connecting edges.\nThe new controllers are the same width as before but are now half an inch taller and feature a brand new 'C' button (on the right Joy-Con 2) to activate the new 'GameChat' feature - a Discord-like chat system that allows Switch 2 users to chat to their friends and share gameplay footage. This new C button will be a paid-for feature in the future, though. Players can use it via a free trial that expires on March 31, 2026, after which they'll need to have a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use it. Without a membership, the C button will be useless and provide no function.\nOne of the biggest changes with the new Joy-Con controllers is that they can be used upside down and are integrated with mouse gameplay mechanics. These brand-new mouse controls are included in both controllers and, when held on their side against a flat surface, can be dragged just like a gaming mouse. Within the Ask the Developer Vol. 16: Nintendo Switch 2 \u2014 Part 2 blog post, producer Kawamoto stated that the mouse controls can be used to \"move your character around with the control stick, while using the right Joy-Con 2 as a mouse to aim and shoot\" in games like Metroid Prime 4 Beyond.\nDespite not using stick-drift eliminating tech like hall effect sticks, the brand-new sticks are larger and more durable, with \"smoother movement\", according to producer Kawamoto, and the L and R buttons have also been lengthened for comfort. They can also be customized by purchasing replacement color panels, however, as of typing, only third-party accessory manufacturers currently have different colored panels available for the new controllers.\namiibo\nNintendo released brand-new Street Fighter 6 and The Legend of Zelda amiibo figures on June 5, 2025.\nFighters Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly received their own amiibo figures, which launched alongside the Switch 2 version of Street Fighter 6 Fighters Edition and unlock \"exclusive in-game content\" and the ability to save and load your favorite character's outfit, control style, and button settings.\nAlongside the figures, 22 amiibo cards featuring a range of Street Fighter 6 characters are also available. The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom also received more amiibos of its own, with figures based on Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, and Sidon. These launched on June 5 too, and unlock fabric for Link\u2019s paraglider, as well as weapons and materials like previously existing Zelda amiibos.\nThe fifth brand-new Zelda amiibo, Mineru's Construct, will be released in the future, however, a release date and price haven't yet been announced.\nNintendo Switch 2 design\nThe design and overall look of the Nintendo Switch 2 are similar to that of the original Switch. The brand-new console features an all-black colorway, with hints of the original blue and red design visible on the side of the controllers and around their sticks.\nThe Switch 2 is still 13.9mm thick, just like the original, but it now wields a 7.9-inch screen. It also has longer gamepads (known as the Joy-Con 2 controllers) that connect magnetically to the side of the device, although there are connecting pins - which hopefully won't be subject to damage in the long run like the mounting rails of the original console. The new Switch also features an updated kickstand design, which, similar to that of the Nintendo Switch OLED, is a lot bigger than the classic Switch and offers up more angles for its tabletop gaming mode.\nNintendo Switch 2 backwards compatibility\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with original Switch games, including physical game carts, digital downloads, and the official Nintendo Switch Online game libraries.\nHowever, the official Nintendo website states that due to the difference in hardware between the two consoles, \"some Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2\" but that the tech giant is continuing to improve compatibilty including by \" working with publishing and developing partners.\"\nYou can check the official Nintendo backwards compatibility list full an in-depth look at every game that's affected by the change of hardware. Additionally, some original Nintendo Switch games still require the use of the older Joy-Con controllers, and we've gathered them all below:\n- Ring Fit Adventure\n- 1-2-Switch\n- Everybody 1-2-Switch\n- Game Builder Garage\n- Nintendo Switch Sports\n- WarioWare Move It!\n- Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 01: Variety Kit\n- Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 02: Robot Kit\n- Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 03: Vehicle Kit\nJust as we suspected, games like Ring Fit Adventure and Nintendo Labo are effected, namely as of their reliance on the old Joy-Con controllers. Ring Fit Adventure is only playable by using an existing Joy-Con controller, as the Joy-Con 2 is not compatible with the Ring Con, and is too large for the leg strap. The new controllers also don't feature an IR Motion Camera, so the older versions of the Joy-Con are required to play games like 1-2-Switch and Everybody 1-2-Switch.\nOn the positive side, a number of original Switch games received free upgrades to \"enhance the gameplay experience\" on the Switch 2. This included ARMS, Big Brain Academy Brain vs. Brain, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, Clubhouse Games 51 Worldwide Classics, Game Builder Garage, New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, Pokemon Scarlet, Pokemon Violet, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, Super Mario Odyssey, and Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom and Link's Awakening.\nThese free upgrades include everything from HDR support, the ability to share locally and online via GameChat, and visual optimizations and frame rate improvements. For example, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which were infamous for their performance on the original Switch, will have \"improved and smoother movement\" on the Switch 2, along with more optimized resolutions to help improve performance.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 also features a new Virtual Game Card system. These new virtual game cards replace the icons of digital Switch games with icons that look more visually like physical game cards. With these digital game cards, you can lend Switch games to any members of your Nintendo family group.\nNintendo Switch 2 games\nThere were a number of Nintendo Switch 2 launch games available to play on day one, and we've gathered them all below:\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour\n- Mario Kart World\n- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Split Fiction\n- Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition\n- Street Fighter 6\n- Sid Meier's Civilization 7 (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Hogwarts Legacy\n- Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster\n- Yakuza 0 Director's Cut\n- Sonic X Shadow Generations\n- Fortnite\n- Hitman World of Assassination \u2013 Signature Edition\n- Deltarune\n- Survival Kids\n- Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess\n- Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S\n- Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma\n- Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition\n- Fast Fusion\n- Arcade Archives 2 Ridge Racer\n- Suikoden I & II HD Remaster for Nintendo Switch 2 Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars\nOut of these launch party titles, we first got a look at Mario Kart World during the big April 2 Nintendo Direct. The latest iteration of the iconic kart racer takes things up a notch by being the first open-world Mario Kart game to date, and it was available on launch day, 2025. The latest kart racer is host to a ton of new tracks, new modes, and even new characters like the Moo Moo Meadows Cow, and a series first with 24 racers hitting the track all at once. The game was available separately for $79.99 / \u00a374.99, and as part of a Nintendo Switch 2 bundle at launch, with a digital copy packed inside.\nThere are a plethora of first-party games planned for the Switch 2, including Super Mario Party Jamboree, which will be receiving its own Switch 2 edition, with Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV. Other than being a mouthful of a title, the game will have opportunities to use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera (sold separately), the new Joy-Con 2 controller's mouse mechanics, and a ton of new modes and features.\nAdditionally, Metroid Prime 4, and Pokemon Legends Z-A will also be making their way onto the Switch 2. Originally, these games were set to release on the current Switch, as shown off during the March game-focused Nintendo Direct presentation. And they are, but Switch 2 owners will be able to grab 'Enhanced Switch 2' versions of the games by buying upgrade packs. These upgrade packs are also available for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, however, the Legend of Zelda upgrades are also included as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.\nAs far as brand-new Switch 2 exclusives, we also got a look at a return of the big man himself, Donkey Kong, in Donkey Kong Bananza set to release on July 17, 2025, and everyone's favorite pink puffball, Kirby, is returning in Kirby AirRiders, directed by Masahiro Sakurai and due for release on the new handheld later this year.\nThere's also a ton of games set to release on the Nintendo Switch 2 shortly after launch, including some of the biggest upcoming releases originally shown off in the April 2 Nintendo Direct. So far, those with confirmed release dates include:\n- Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army (19 June)\n- Tamagotchi Plaza (27 June)\n- Donkey Kong Bananza (17 July)\n- Shadow Labyrinth (18 July)\n- No Sleep For Kaname Date (25 July)\n- Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar (27 August)\n- Wild Hearts S (25 July)\n- Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 (11 July)\n- Daemon x Machina Titanic Scion (5 September)\n- Pokemon Legends Z-A (16 October)\nWhen it comes to physical games, the carts for the Switch 2 are the same size as the original Switch games - however, now, they're red instead of black to distinguish themselves from what came before. The disgusting taste of the previous Switch game carts has also returned.\nNintendo Switch 2 Accessories\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 has a plethora of official (and licensed) accessories, and we've listed them and their pricing (where available) below:\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Camera ( $54.99 / \u00a349.99)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller ($84.99 / \u00a374.99)\n- Nintendo GameCube (GCN) Controller - Nintendo Classics (\u00a358.99)\n- Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip ($34.99 / \u00a329.99)\n- Nintendo Switch microSD Express Card 256GB for Nintendo Switch 2 ( $59.99 / \u00a349.99)\n- Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case ($84.99 / \u00a366.99)\n- Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector ( $39.99 / \u00a320.99)\n- Joy-Con 2 Wheel (set of two) ( $24.99 / \u00a316.99)\n- Piranha Plant Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 (\u00a334.99)\n- Joy-Con 2 (L) and Joy-Con 2 (R) Controller Set ($94.99 / \u00a374.99)\n- Joy-Con 2 Strap ($13.99)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter ($34.99 / \u00a324.99)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set ($119.99)\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller, Switch 2 camera, and the GameCube controller were released on June 5, 2025, the same day as the console. Alongside these brand-new peripherals, an official Joy-Con 2 charging grip, Joy-Con 2 wheel (set of two), Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector, and Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case were also released on launch day.\nThe prices of first-party Switch 2 accessories in the US and Canada rose in April 2025, which Nintendo explained is \"due to changes in market conditions.\" The Joy-Con 2 controllers, Switch 2 Pro controller, and the Switch 2 camera all received a $5 price hike. Meanwhile, even the Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set and Joy-Con charging grip also increased in price by $5, while the official Joy-Con 2 strap increased by just $1. Not all accessories were affected, as the prices of the officially licensed microSD Express cards remain unchanged.\nThough there are some exceptions, a lot of original Switch accessories can be used with the upcoming Switch 2, including the original Joy-Con controllers, which can be \"paired wirelessly\" to the Switch 2, which is the same case as the original Switch Pro controller.

      "text": "Upcoming Switch 2 games for 2025 and beyond\nSeptember is here, meaning plenty of upcoming Switch 2 games are just around the corner\nWith so many upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games coming up now we're in September, it's a great chance to take stock of what goodies we've gotten our hands on already.\nThe host of fantastic Switch 2 launch games included the long-awaited Mario Kart World, with Donkey Kong Bananza releasing weeks later.

      "text": "Kirby Air Riders should be delayed to 2026 if anything is \"not going perfectly,\" former Nintendo marketing leads say, because it's not worth burning out Smash Bros creator Masahiro Sakurai\nPlus Mario Kart World and Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds are pretty heavy competition\nFormer Nintendo marketing managers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang say the best move for Kirby Air Riders may be to delay it to 2026.\nNintendo has a pretty stacked rest of 2025 all things considered, but outside of Drag X Drive in August and Pokemon Legends Z-A in October, we don't know when any of it is coming out, and last week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase didn't shine any light on that (obviously, being a Partner Showcase and all).\nHowever, you can kind of infer that Metroid Prime 4 will probably be first up the plate, having been playable at events as far back as April, with Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment later on since gameplay footage and a \"winter 2025\" release is out there, and then there's Kirby Air Riders, which has a minute and a half long CGI trailer.\nDespite being confirmed for \"2025,\" Ellis and Yang \u2013 who previously served as Nintendo of America's director of social media marketing and original content, and senior manager of creator relations and original content, respectively \u2013reckon Nintendo's best move may be to push Kirby Air Riders to 2026. This follows on from Ellis's own comments that it's \"not normal\" that we don't have release dates for big 2025 Switch 2 games like the first-party trio and arguably the two biggest third-party releases with Elden Ring and Final Fantasy 7 Remake.\nThe duo have released a new YouTube video titled \"Why Nintendo Should Delay Kirby Air Riders to 2026.\" In the video, they go over three reasons why a push to 2026 may benefit Kirby, first being a reiteration of the previous point that \"it's now August\" and major games don't have release dates. Yang says, \"The days of these packed release calendars for games. I don't think that's happening any more for this generation,\" citing Nintendo's game-a-month strategy when the original Switch launched back in 2017.\nThen there's the fact that the Switch 2 has a lot of racing games already; Mario Kart World had an attach-rate of almost 1:1 with Switch 2, with only 190,000 console owners not picking up the game in the first month. Not only that, but even if you ignore available racing games with a different vibe like Fast Fusion, F Zero GX on GameCube online, and Ridge Racer, there's still Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds arriving in September to take another chunk of the mascot racing game market.\nTheir third reason is more interesting however. Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai is directing Kirby Air Riders, and Sakurai has expressed doubt that he could top Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. There's ongoing speculation that Kirby Air Riders is a passion project, with YouTube interviewer KiwiTalkz previously claiming that Sakurai \"as a negotiating tactic offered to do another Smash if he could do Kirby Air Riders first.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nEllis and Yang both mention that you would want to keep Sakurai happy, and that unlike most cases with Nintendo, Yang says, \"Sakurai holds the cards in this equation.\" So if Sakurai (who Yang refers to as a \"perfectionist\") thinks development on Air Riders needs a little more time in the oven, it's probably best to delay it rather than have a crunch that could impact his desire to work on a new Smash Bros game.\nEllis adds: \"If there's anything about this game that's not going perfectly, this is not the game to burn him out on.\"\nScott has been freelancing for over three years across a number of different gaming publications, first appearing on GamesRadar+ in 2024. He has also written for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, VG247, Play, TechRadar, and others. He's typically rambling about Metal Gear Solid, God Hand, or any other PS2-era titles that rarely (if ever) get sequels.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "The 15 best Switch 2 games to play right now in 2025\nDive into Nintendo's new console with the best Nintendo Switch 2 games, from Mario Kart World to Street Fighter 6\nNintendo's new console may have only recently released, but there's already a strong selection of the best Switch 2 games so far. In fact, since June, we've had shiny remasters, specialized versions of some of the best games of 2025, exciting new titles, and more to add to our gaming libraries.\nHowever, before you start reaching for those gold coins and filling up your carts on the Nintendo e-Shop, let's be honest, the Switch 2 isn't exactly cheap. You may also have your heart set on some upcoming Switch 2 games set to release later in the year, like Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A or Octopath Traveler 0. So, with that in mind, we've taken stock of all the games currently available to download and play on the Switch 2 right now and have made a round-up of the 15 greatest picks that are well worth your hard-earned cash. Below, you'll find everything from Switch 2 exclusives, to Switch 2 game upgrades that bring something new to some of the best Switch games, and the standout Switch 2 launch games.\nWe keep this list updated with every new Switch 2 release, so be sure to check in regularly each month for any new additions. But for now, let's make like Mario Kart and race through the best Switch 2 games to play as of August 2025.\nThe 15 best Switch 2 games to play in 2025\n15. Hitman World of Assassination: Signature Edition\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\nReleased: 2025\nHitman World of Assassination: Signature Edition is a brand new iteration of Hitman World of Assassination specially for the Switch 2 that adds 100-plus hours of content to the already massive base game. And trust us, you'll likely want to play through it all. Taking on the role of Agent 47, Hitman World of Assassination isn't just a fun game that gives you targets to take out and goals to achieve in each level.\nIt's an experience that promotes glorious chaos and creativity, all wrapped up in stunning locations and refined stealth gameplay that make it impossible to put down. Not only does this title include the Hitman 2 Expansion Pack, but it also comes with the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack and the Seven Deadly Sins Pack as well. This means out of all the entries on our list of the best Switch 2 games, this one has one of the best price-value points, especially if you're looking for bargains after paying for the new console.\n14. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma\nDeveloper: Marvelous Inc.\nReleased: 2025\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nSet in the kingdom of Azuma (an East Asian inspired world), Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma is the newest entry in the iconic cozy RPG series and is the perfect pick for a relaxing handheld experience on the Switch 2. While the story isn't as gripping as Rune Factory 4 or 5, Guardians of Azuma has a ton to do and will have you hooked with its cozy gameplay loop and charming RPG elements.\nLike with previous Rune Factory games, you can farm, fight, tame monsters, and even romance one of the characters you'll meet throughout the story. But what really sets Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma apart from other titles in the series is the new city-building-esque mechanics available. Not only will you manage your room and farm, but you can also build shops and assign workers to them as well. It's a cool addition to the typical Rune Factory formula, and helps capture that cozy game feel.\n13. Sonic X Shadow Generations\nDeveloper: Sonic Team\nReleased: 2024\nMario isn't the only iconic mascot on the Switch 2, folks! Sega's famous speedy hedgehog and his edgy counterpart race onto Nintendo's new console with the acclaimed collection Sonic X Shadow Generations. This bundle will give you the remaster of Sonic Generations (aka one of the best Sonic games ever released) and the paraquel 2024 title Shadow Generations, which sees Shadow the Hedgehog face off against Black Doom.\nWhen it comes to polished, fast-paced platformers, few titles can hold a candle to Sonic X Shadow Generations. The game curates and improves on some of the best levels in Sonic history, while also giving us fresh Shadow levels that highlight his unique abilities. Get ready to feel the thrill of unlocking the Chaos Dash and the joy of flying across levels with Shadow's Doom Wings. Shadow's campaign also offers five additional hours of gameplay, which, when paired with the graphical and performance improvements from the Switch 2, make this an absolute steal.\n12. Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess\nDeveloper: Capcom\nReleased: 2024\nPlaying as the warrior Soh, it's up to you to protect the divine maiden named Yoshiro, as she purges the evil rot from villages and works to restore Mt. Kafuku to peace. You'll have to defeat hordes of supernatural enemies, cleanse rot around the map, rescue villagers, and juggle a number of other tasks too. The gameplay in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is fast-paced but also tactical, rewarding you with satisfying sharp sword swings and strategic plays. This release even comes with the Otherworldly Ventures update (which will be on all platforms), adding even more wave-based replayability.\nThe visuals and world-building are also stunning, with strong Japanese and mythological influences leading the charge. Our Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess review mentions how the game feels like a \"throwback to a now-classic era of Capcom\", back when titles such as Okami had us all in a chokehold. It's truly one of the best games of 2024 and is a worthwhile addition to your Switch 2 library.\n11. Deltarune Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4\nDeveloper: tobyfox\nReleased: 2025\nDeltarune is a \"sort of\" Undertale prequel, and has just as much charm and heart as Toby Fox's breakout success. While this new game features some characters and features from Undertale, Deltarune centers around a new human child called Chris, who is transported into a new dark world. Chris must make their way through this new magical setting to find a way back home.\nYou'll have to explore, solve puzzles, and fight enemies in turn-based combat. Whether you kill your foes or choose to spare them is up to you. Deltarune has been releasing episodic chapters for years now. However, chapters three and four are brand new! New chapters will be released in the future as well, but for now, we can play through what's available with this delightfully comical story and even discover a secret room that uses exclusive Switch 2 controls.\n10. Fantasy Life I: The Girl Who Steals Time (Switch 2 Edition)\nDeveloper: LEVEL5 Inc.\nReleased: 2025\nFantasy Life I: The Girl Who Steals Time is one of the best cozy games to release in 2025, and it's the perfect Switch 2 game to crack on with if you're looking for an Animal Crossing meets Zelda kind of experience. The sequel to the 2014 title Fantasy Life (aka one of the best 3DS games of all time), Fantasy Life I: The Girl Who Steals Time revolves around a hero who finds themselves in the fantasy world of Reveria after a run-in with some dragons.\nIt'll be up to you to choose between fourteen jobs known as \"life classes\" and level them up as you progress through the story. Fantasy Life I: The Girl Who Steals Time is a laid-back RPG that is addictive, rewarding, and offers tons of gameplay. You can focus on combat, decorating, crafting, or all of the above. The Switch 2 version also offers faster loading times and better graphics. It's an all-around winner!\n9. Split Fiction\nDeveloper: Hazelight Studios\nReleased: 2025\nIf you want to experience one of the best co-op games of all time on the Switch 2, then Split Fiction is the title for you. You and your player two will play as either Mio or Zoe (two aspiring authors who specialize in sci-fi and fantasy, respectively). You'll have to team up and make your way through each other's stories as you try to escape a machine that is hell bent on extracting all your ideas. Not only is Split Fiction visually stunning and emotionally touching, but its level design is heaps of fun.\nEach new world you explore has its own creative mechanics, from shooting robots, flying dragons, or playing a rhythm mini-game with a bunch of monkeys. As our Split Fiction review states, the game \"perfectly straddles two genres simultaneously and consistently introduces one good idea after another.\" With a free friend pass and local co-op available, this is the best two-player experience on the Switch 2 so far.\n8. Yakuza 0 Director's Cut\nDeveloper: Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio\nReleased: 2025\nYakuza 0 is the best Yakuza game ever made (just check out our Yakuza 0 review for more on that), so of course, the new Director's Cut edition of this iconic title made our list of the best Switch 2 games. Set during Japan's '80s economic boom, Yakuza 0 marks the start of the story in terms of the long-running franchise. You'll follow a young Kiryu and Majima, and play through their interconnected stories surrounding their paths in the criminal world, set against a gripping real estate plot.\nYakuza 0 has an amazing story, but is also filled with charming and silly side-quests that keep you smiling in between heavy story reveals. The beat 'em up gameplay is also uber satisfying as you hit combos and plummet enemies into the dirt. However, the big standout here is that the Director's Cut offers new cut scenes and English voice-overs. For Yakuza veterans and series newcomers, this is a Switch 2 must-play.\n7. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch 2 Edition)\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2025\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a masterpiece. So, its new Switch 2 version is an easy addition to our list. Link is back, and Princess Zelda needs rescuing again. Much like the first game, there's a sense of wonder and polish during every questline and discovery. However, the story feels grander and the world is more captivating too. The Switch 2 edition also offers improved graphics and supports the Zelda Notes App, which provides numerous interactive features to enhance your game.\nIn our The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, we write: \"Tears of the Kingdom manages to keep focus and provide a rich, robust experience that builds on what came before.\" However, it's still a sequel at the end of the day, and for that reason, we didn't rank it higher on this list. Breath of the Wild (which we'll get more into later) is still the best starting point to revisit Link's journey on the Switch 2. However, Tears of the Kingdom is a follow-up that you don't want to miss.\n6. Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red\nReleased: 2025\nCyberpunk 2077 is one of the best RPGs of all time. It's also a pretty taxing game to run with all of its realistic graphics. However, the Switch 2 runs this futuristic story like a dream. Developed by CD Projekt Red, Cyberpunk 2077 is set in the dystopian metropolis Night City, where you take on the role of a mercenary called V. After getting stuck with a cybernetic \"bio-chip\", you'll have to work to save your life and separate from a Keanu Reeves-shaped engram.\nWith FPS elements mixed with action-RPG mechanics, Cyberpunk 2077 offers a detailed open world and some of the best quest lines in modern gaming, period. In our Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 hands-on preview, we note that the game feels as if we're running the title on a PC with settings ranging from \"Medium\" to \"High\". So, don't worry, the Switch 2 does this title justice. It also includes all DLC, so it's a great bargain for new players, especially.\n5. Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster\nDeveloper: Cattle Call Inc\nReleased: 2025\nBravely Default Flying Fairy is widely considered to be one of the best JRPGs to ever hit Nintendo since it first released in 2012. So, it makes sense that we'd get a shiny remaster to celebrate the launch of the Switch 2. Luckily for us, despite being over a decade old, Bravely Default Flying Fairy is still as charming and captivating as it was back in the day.\nSet in Luxendarc and following four heroes who must reclaim elemental crystals from the forces of darkness to save their world, Bravely Default Flying Fairy is a classic turn-based RPG. However, it's Brave and Default system offers a fun twist to the typical combat seen in JRPGs. Gathering Brave points to take multiple actions against a strong enemy never gets old! So, while its story isn't as revolutionary as it once was, Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster gives a classic a modern makeover and is still worth your time.\n4. Street Fighter 6 (Switch 2 Edition)\nDeveloper: Capcom\nReleased: 2025\nIn our five-star Street Fighter 6 review, we call it \"the best overall fighting game package ever made\". So, yeah, it's an easy addition to our list of the best Switch 2 games and should be on every gamer's radar, for sure. Complete with an 18-character roster with new and returning fighters, Capcom's latest entry to its iconic competitive fighting series is polished, massive, and the perfect addition to add to your Switch 2 library.\nNot only are there tons of modes (such as one of the best online battle hubs ever made), but the Switch 2 exclusive modes like Gyro Battle and Calorie Contest are pure fire co-op hits, that will have your heart pounding and friendships put to the test in the best way possible. Basically, even if you've played Street Fighter 6 before, there is a ton of new content to explore with Nintendo's fresh version of this 2023 masterpiece.\n3. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Switch 2 Edition)\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2025\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the best games ever made, and now you can play it on the Nintendo Switch 2. While its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, is also available (and should be played if possible as well), Breath of the Wild is still one of the best open-world games around and should be your starting point if you want to experience Link's journey all over again as he sets out to rescue Princess Zelda and save the world from Calamity Ganon.\nThe Switch 2 Edition of the game feels rewarding to play through. Thanks to the new Zelda Notes app via the Nintendo Switch App, your progress feels more involved, as you can experience Voice Memories from characters, have a handy navigation tool at the ready, and even engage in item sharing. It truly feels like we're experiencing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild all over again, and it's still just as mesmerizing as it was back in 2017. Read our Breath of the Wild review for more details on this must-play!\n2. Mario Kart World\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2025\nAt this point, Mario Kart is an institution, and Mario Kart World is hands down the best racing game that we've had from the beloved series in a long time. Taking a new Forza Horizon-style approach to gameplay, Mario Kart World expands the tried and tested formula to give players more freedom to explore, take pictures, and just drive for the fun of it in between races, thanks to the new Free Roam mode.\nBut on the competitive side of things, things have also been cranked up a notch. There are 24 drivers that you'll have to beat, secret characters to unlock, and a battle royale style mode called Knockout Tour that will 1000% cause a few screaming matches in your household. In our Mario Kart World preview, our competitive spirits were pushed to the max, and we couldn't wait to get our hands on the console for another round.\n1. Donkey Kong Bananza\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2025\nDonkey Kong Bananza officially landed to take the top spot among the very best Switch 2 games around right now. As we detailed in our Donkey Kong Bananza review, the destruction DK is able to unleash really is a smashing good time, and with a story packed full of charm, the adventure is topped off with a variety of different levels that keep the experience feeling fresh and varied throughout.\nThere's a lot of Super Mario Odyssey DNA on display, with vast areas to work your way through and plenty of collectibles to find, but the pairing of DK and a young Pauline really shines as they work together to reach the center of the earth, where they hope to fulfill their dreams. If there's one Switch 2 game to tuck into right now, it's undoubtedly Donkey Kong Bananza. Hopefully, this is just the beginning of fresh new Switch 2 exclusives that we can look forward to as well.\nFor more exciting releases, check out our roundup of all the new games heading our way this year.\nAfter reviewing films throughout University and being a cosy game expert for years, I realised that entertainment journalism was my true calling in 2019.

      "text": "Pokemon Legends Z-A: Everything we know so far about the upcoming Nintendo game\nPokemon Legends Z-A has been confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2 and is launching later this year!\nPokemon Legends Z-A is officially coming this year, with The Pokemon Company at last confirming an October release date for the RPG. This news comes after we got a hearty helping of gameplay footage earlier this year, with showcases revealing we'll be venturing back to the single-city setting of Lumiose, which previously appeared in Pokemon X and Y.\nFrom open-zone areas to real-time dodges and commands, and the return of Mega Evolutions for the first time in seven years, the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct also confirmed the new adventure will be landing on the new-gen console as one of the many upcoming Switch 2 games. And excitingly, (thanks to the July Pokemon Presents showcase), we've also recently learned some story details and new features, such as Pokemon grooming, as well. It's all coming together, but with so much news, it's hard to keep on track with one of the most anticipated new games for 2025, not to mention one of the biggest upcoming Switch games on the horizon.\nTo make your life easier, we've gathered all the details into one handy guide for you. So, read on below as we take you through an overview of everything we know so far about Pokemon Legends Z-A.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A release date confirmed\nThe Pokemon Company has confirmed that Pokemon Z-A Legends release date will be October 16, 2025.\nThe official release date came in a press release from Nintendo, which at least gives us a concrete time frame following the \"late 2025\" window that was revealed previously.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A platforms\nPokemon Legends: Z-A will launch on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, with the Switch 2 version being an Enhanced Edition, according to the March 2025 Nintendo Direct.\nIt's worth noting that The Pokemon Company has used slightly confusing language across its social channels, stating that Z-A is coming to \"Nintendo Switch systems.\" Following the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, a recent Nintendo Direct showcase confirmed that the upcoming Pokemon game will indeed be launching on past and current generations of its flagship console. Great news for anyone not looking to upgrade just yet!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nPokemon Legends: Z-A trailer\nWe got our first proper trailer for Pokemon Legends: Z-A during the 2025 Pokemon Day showcase on February 27. In the clip, we see scenes of Pokemon having fun throughout Lumiose City - which is currently undergoing redevelopment to be a home for both trainers and Pokemon alike.\nWe also see the designated \"Wild Zones\" that exist in the metropolis, marked by green gates. Of course, we also see some battles, critter catching, and world exploration. It's classic Pokemon here, and we are excited to see more trailers drop in the future!\nYou can watch the Pokemon Legends: Z-A trailer above.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A gameplay\nThanks to the Pokemon Legends: Z-A trailers, we've now gotten multiple looks at the expected gameplay for the upcoming title. This includes its setting, which will be entirely within Lumiose City. This means that you're likely going to be unable to explore the wider Kalos Region. That's no doubt going to be a bit of a letdown for some of you Pokemon X and Y fans out there, but it does make sense, given the smaller scope of the Pokemon Legends series of titles.\nHowever, don't worry, there's still plenty to do. While in Lumiose City, your player character will be staying at a hotel named Hotel Z, which will be your base of operations as you tackle all sorts of incidents that will occur in the city. You'll be joining a team dedicated to protecting the city known as Team MZ. During the day, you can explore the city, diving into lush \"wild zones\" where you can catch some new party members and battle wild Pokemon.\nThe city is also filled with side-quests, including research objectives to complete for resident scientist Mable and detective quests to fulfill with the returning X and Y character Emma. The city is filled with customization options to such as Pokemon grooming and relaxation spots. However, during nighttime, you'll have to battle other trainers in the \"Z-A Royale\" system and make your way up through the ranks to progress the story. This comes with significant changes to the battling mechanics as well.\nAccording to the Pokemon website, in Pokemon Legends: Z\u2011A, \"Trainers and their Pokemon will move around in real-time during battles.\" There are also new features to consider when battling, such as the precise timing for swapping out your Pokemon, the different lengths of time moves will take, and how big an area the moves will impact.\" This will be the first battle system of its kind in a Pokemon game and will make combat a lot more of a strategic affair.\nNintendo also revealed that the title of the game actually references the new ranking system that's linked to the competitive battle zones. As trainers, we'll start out at rank Z and rise up to rank A, hence Z-A.\nPokemon Legends Z-A starters\nThe three Pokemon Legends Z-A starters are Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile.\nChikorita is the grass-type starter that was first introduced in Generation II. It is also one of the first three starters in Pokemon of Johto seen during Pokemon Gold and Silver. This grass type is described as having a gentle personality who loves sunbathing. So, if you love cozy, cute things, it'll be the perfect starter for you. Chikorita also evolves into Bayleef starting at level 16, which then evolves into Meganium (aka the most adorable and dinosaur-coded Pok\u00e9mon around) at level 32.\nTotodile is the water-type starter, which was also introduced in Generation II and, like Chikorita, was a starter during Pokemon Gold and Silver. This Pokemon has a rough personality and a tendency to bite, so be on the lookout for your fingers if you choose this critter as your first partner. Totodile evolves into Croconaw at level 18, which then evolves into Feraligatr starting at level 30.\nFinally, we have Tepig, the fire-type starter. Tepig was introduced during Generation V and was one of the starters available during Pokemon Black and White. Tepig loves finding food but has a habit of excitedly burning things when it's to worked up. Tepig evolves into Pignite at level 17, and then into Emboar starting at level 36.\nPokemon Legends: Z-A The Legendary Pokemon\nLegendary Pokemon will also be among the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Pokedex for all of us to meet when the game releases later this year. The one we know for sure is heading our way is Zygarde.\nZygarde was first introduced during the sixth generation as a dual-type Dragon/Ground Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and was a major player in the animated Pokemon the Series: XY.\nAccording to the Pokemon website, \"Zygarde is made up of a multitude of cell-like components, and it changes form depending on how many of these components have gathered together. Its brain is made up of the few existing Zygarde Cores, while the rest of its body is comprised of Zygarde Cells, which are far more plentiful. It seems to have taken a special interest in you... What could its connection to this story be?\"\nExpect Zygarde to be a massive part of the story of Pokemon Legends: Z-A. We may also see some possible connections to this legendary and the large corporation called Quasartico Inc. (that is re-developing Lumiose City). Stay tuned for updates!\nPokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolution explained\nPokemon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolution brings back a beloved feature first introduced in Pokemon X and Y that will boost your Pokemon's power and change their appearance. In Lumiose City, some Pokemon can go beyond normal evolution when they raise their levels in battle. Only a few Pokemon can Mega Evolve, and when they do, it temporarily unleashes the energy hidden within the Pokemon.\nWhen a trainer has a high bond with their partner, a Key Stone (worn by the Trainer) will resonate with the Pokemon's \"Mega Stone\" - that is what allows the evolution to take place. Below is a list of some of the confirmed Pokemon who can use Mega Evolution in Pokemon Legends: Z-A.\n- Mega Charizard X\n- Mega Charizard Y\n- Mega Dragonite\n- Mega Kangaskhan\n- Mega Ampharos\n- Mega Gardevoir\n- Mega Sableye\n- Mega Altaria\n- Mega Absol\n- Mega Lucario\nThe list above is expected to grow. And, in fact, according to leakers, 27 new Mega Evolutions could be added in the upcoming game. So far, in the series' history, we've had 48 Mega Evolutions. An additional 27 would bring the new total up to an impressive 75.\nHowever, before you get too excited about this news, keep in mind that nothing has been officially confirmed just yet. We'll keep you posted as more news heads our way!\nCan you pre-order Pokemon Legends: Z-A?\nYes! Pokemon Legends Z-A Pre-orders are live as of June 5, 2025. You can also currently wishlist the game on the Nintendo e-Shop now.\nFans can now pre-order both a digital and a physical copy of the game via the Nintendo e-Shop. Prices for the Switch version of the game are $59.99/\u00a349.99, while the Switch 2 versions will cost you $69.99/\u00a358.99. You'll also get a bonus item if you purchase the deal, which will be a \"Pokemon Legends: Z-A Partner Pokemon Figurine\", comprising the starters in the game.\nAnd, if you are a big collector and live in the UK, there are also Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A Edition Mega Evolution bundles up for grabs for both the original Switch and the Switch 2. This bundle comes with the game, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y figurines, and a pin set of the starters.\nIf you don't have a Switch 2 yet, you can also get a Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundle that includes the new game with the console for $499.99.

      "text": "A 3D Mario game for the Switch 2 could be \"many years away\" as former Nintendo marketing leads also speculate Donkey Kong Bananza is being made by the Super Mario Odyssey team\n\"3D Mario is probably coming very late\" if the team has been busy with Donkey Kong, they suggest\nYesterday's Donkey Kong Bananza Direct proved without a shadow of a doubt that the upcoming Switch 2-exclusive isn't one to miss, but we still don't know exactly what development team is working on it within Nintendo. Although one option is looking increasingly more likely, two former Nintendo marketing leads speculate that this could be bad news for 3D Mario fans, as the next game could be \"many years away\" as a result.\nNintendo has remained tight-lipped about exactly who is making Donkey Kong Bananza, but right from its reveal, many have speculated that it might be Production Group No. 8 \u2013 better known as EPD Tokyo \u2013 a team that's produced nothing but bangers from Super Mario Odyssey to Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 3D World. The new DK game does look very visually reminiscent of Odyssey \u2013 hell, the costume shop shown during yesterday's Direct practically screamed it.\nSpeaking about the situation prior to the Direct stream, Kit Ellis, Nintendo of America's former director of social media marketing and original content, and Krysta Yang, the company's former senior manager of creator relations and original content, also suspect that EPD Tokyo is indeed the team responsible. However, unless they've got \"some new arrangement where somebody else is involved in one way or another,\" then the \"implication is we might just be waiting for a good long time before we get the next 3D Mario game,\" Ellis suggests.\n\"That team is incredible, nobody's disputing the quality, [but] they are not fast, they are not prolific, they are not pumping out games,\" he continues.\nNoting that it's unlikely that Nintendo would want to do anything to \"jeopardize\" its next 3D Mario game, Yang speculates: \"From my perspective, if it is confirmed that EPD Tokyo is working on Bananza, then that does mean, unfortunately, that 3D Mario is probably coming very late.\" Ellis chimes in: \"Just reset the clock on 3D Mario.\"\nYang then suggests that it could then be \"four, five, six years\" until the next 3D Mario game, with Ellis adding: \"We're still going to get it, but it's going to be more of a late-generation [game], at soonest a mid-generation.\"\nThis puts Nintendo in an interesting position, Ellis says, pointing out that we also don't know when we'll be getting the next mainline Zelda game after Tears of the Kingdom. \"The two big things that carried the year one of the Switch 1, and it's like we're going to be many, many years into the Switch 2 before we start to see those or even hear about those, honestly. It's a different path and it does feel riskier than those games that were just like, 'oh, this is a sure thing.'\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nFurthermore, Yang speculates that the potential impact Donkey Kong Bananza's development could have, by theoretically making \"our precious, beloved 3D Mario game\" be \"many, many, many, many years away,\" could be a reason why Nintendo hasn't actually shared who's working on it yet. \"I think that they are scared that that sort of underlining thing will kind of put a little damper on this game. And they need this game to perform for them, they're still in this very critical launch period.\"\nOf course, all this is speculation for now, as we don't know for sure who's making the game at all.

      "text": "Former Nintendo marketing lead says it's \"not normal\" we still don't have release dates for Elden Ring, Metroid Prime 4, and more Switch 2 games: \"That's not the Nintendo that I know\"\nIt's August and there are five big 2025 Switch 2 games we don't have release dates for\nYesterday's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase included a lot of great-looking games, but it arguably raised more questions than answers about what the remainder of Switch 2's first year on the market is going to look like. According to Kit Ellis, Nintendo of America's former director of social media marketing and original content, it's very out of character for the publisher to not have release dates for its slate locked down by this point in the year.\n\"It's just not passing the sniff test for me, and it all seems a little suspicious,\" Ellis says in a new episode of the Kit & Krysta podcast. \"Having worked there, it gives me certain feelings that things are not going as smoothly as maybe Nintendo would want. I think there's a lot of uncertainty. I think there's a lot of concern. And I think, frankly, they're trying to put on a brave face and carry on as if everything's okay, while at the same time really trying to get a handle on what's happening with these games.\"\nEllis says there are currently five major upcoming Switch 2 games for 2025 without release dates: Elden Ring, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Metroid Prime 4, and Kirby Air Riders. Accounting for the technicalities that the \"winter\" release window of Hyrule Warriors could stretch into 2026, and that Metroid Prime 4 is technically billed as a Switch 1 game with an upgrade, I think it's easy to see the point \u2013 that's a lot of games central to the Switch 2 lineup that we still don't have a release date for here in August.\n\"I'll tell you, that's not normal,\" Ellis says, \"and it's making me worried about the state of these games and whether they're all going to make it out this year.\" We're now deep into the summer, and Ellis says \"there's a reason E3 used to happen in June\": because it was the right time to reveal release dates and build marketing plans so consumers could make their holiday shopping plans, which according to Nintendo's market research, starts as early as September.\n\"It's very possible that one game is holding everything up,\" Ellis posits, suggesting that if even one of these big titles hasn't yet settled on a release date, it becomes difficult to settle on a launch plan for any of them. He also suggests it's possible third-party developers have struggled to get hold of Switch 2 dev kits, which may be holding up the process further.\nIt's not like any of us are lacking for games to play these days, but Ellis says \"the concern goes beyond that. It's that Nintendo is having trouble \u2013 and the partners are having trouble \u2013 getting games finished on this new platform, when they've already communicated that they're launching this year. Again, that's not the Nintendo that I know, that is usually so on top of the dev teams and their cycles and these dates.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

      "text": "Mario Kart World: Everything you need to know about the new Switch 2 game\nMario Kart 9 (aka Mario Kart World) is finally here, along with the Switch 2, so here's all the latest news about the new Nintendo game\nMario Kart World is finally here, and it's opening up a brand new era for our favourite racing plumber and his pals. As the follow-up to one of the best racing games of all time, let alone one of the very best Switch games we saw come to Nintendo's last-gen console, Mario Kart World has already accelerated its way to being one of the most anticipated new games of the year since it's announcement during the Nintendo Switch 2 direct back in April.\nNot only is it bringing brand new modes, a massive roster of characters, and a Free Roam feature, but we are also getting choice chat and a ton of cool online features as well. However, while we personally say this is the best Switch 2 game currently available, you may be wondering if this competitive outing is for you. After all, the Switch 2 isn't exactly cheap, and there are still plenty of upcoming Switch 2 games on the horizon for you to spend your money on instead. Well, we're here to give you all the Mario Kart World information that you need to know before you break the bank.\nBelow is a round-up of all the latest Mario Kart World news, first impressions, gameplay details, tracks, characters, and more. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to rev up those engines and start scrolling on down!\nMario Kart World release date\nMario Kart World was officially released on the Switch 2 on June 5, 2025. This date was first revealed back during the April 2 showcase. However, we technically got our first look at the game on January 16, during the Switch 2 announcement that showed some sneaky racing footage.\nWhile Mario Kart World reviews are still coming in, first impressions of the game have generally been positive. Many are praising the title's new Knockout mode, while the Free Roam feature that lets players drive around the map at their own leisure to discover secrets and stickers to customize their vehicles with has been mixed.\nIn our Mario Kart World June preview, we were in the camp who liked the scope of Free Roam and generally are excited to keep discovering more of Mario Kart World, as there is a ton to explore and unpack. We'll let you know what the general consensus truly is once more reviews start popping up in the wild.\nMario Kart World trailer\nMario Kart World platforms\nMario Kart World is a Switch 2 exclusive. So that means you won't be able to play it on your old Switch.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOne thing is for certain, as well, like with all Mario games, platforms will be strictly Nintendo-owned and operated. So, don't expect to play Mario Kart 9 on your Steam Deck or PS5 anytime soon.\nMario Kart World gameplay\nThe Mario Kart World gameplay reveal during the Nintendo 2 Direct gave us our first proper look at the new Mario Kart game in action, and it's gone in an open-world direction. Instead of the usual track set-up we've seen in previous entries, the races take place in \"various regions that span the globe\", and even feature different weather conditions and times of day, which changes up the atmosphere of the race you're speeding your way through.\nNot only that, but you won't just be hitting the road either, with the ability to drive almost anywhere. Yes, that means you can now race off the track, too, and there's even an option to go for a casual drive with pals in a new Free Roam. From our time with the game so far, this pairs perfectly with the game's photo mode, which is another new feature introduced in Mario Kart World - the trailer shows some drivers sidling up together to get in the camera frame for a screenshot.\nThere are also 24 racers hitting the track, which is a series first, and there are a ton of fancy new features as well. For instance, a new \"Charge Jump\" move lets you jump onto rails, quickly avoid attacks, and lets you chain wall drives in order to uncover secret routes on the course. You can also unlock outfits for your racers by finding food on different tracks.\nWorld also lives up to its name by having you race between courses during the Grand Prix mode to reach the next track, which makes it feel much bigger in scope and keeps the flow of the race going. Each \"lap\" to the next course is broken up into sections as opposed to looping tracks.\nIn the past, vehicles were broken up into different parts we could choose from -such as selecting wheels and paragliders, but a past Nintendo Treehouse also confirmed that the vehicles in World are all \"fully formed\".\nWith a Mario Kart World Direct in April following the console's dedicated showcase, we got a big deep-dive into the new racing adventure, with confirmation that Free-Roam features \"hundreds\" of P switches that are hidden around the world that start up missions a bit like those found in Mario Kart DS's Mission Mode - with the switches appearing to start up objectives such as collecting a set number of coins, or reaching a particular goal.\nFinally, voice chat is in Mario Kart World for all you Nintendo Switch Online Members. It will also be compatible with the new Switch 2 camera if you plan to watch your friends play or keep an eye on them online. Tilt Controls for motion control steering are also available for folks. There is also a Joy-Con 2 Wheel accessory up for sale, but that will cost you extra.\nMario Kart World modes\nThere are five modes in Mario Kart World: Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, Time Trials, Vs Race, and Battle. So, let's break down each of them.\nIn Grand Prix mode, you'll race against drivers, and once you complete all circuits, Nintendo has also teased that potentially a \"colorful new course\" will unlock as well. There are a total of seven cups to play through, each with four distinctive tracks. Like with past Mario Kart games, the difficulty of your races is up to what engine classes you pick before starting a circuit (eg. 50cc, 100cc, etc).\nIn VS races, you can create up to four competing teams this time around, fully utilizing the stacked 24-racer roster in the game. This mode will have you and your team compete in a Grand Prix, and it's up to you to gather more points than your opponents by placing higher after each race.\nWhile not a new mode officially in Mario Kart World, Free Roam is a new feature that we need to highlight as well. In Free Roam, we can, as the name gives away, freely roam through any of the tracks within a cup course. You can go in any direction you want, too, with the freedom to go off-road and casually drive around with friends around any part of the course. This presents you with the chance to not only explore but also try to learn each track and perhaps come up with new strategies to win.\nAnother new Mario Kart World mode is Knockout Tour, which is a \"transcontinental rally\" where 24 players have to try and avoid being knocked out and make it through each leg of the race - all the tracks are interconnected. Every checkpoint will have set parameters, so you have to be in a certain place in the race to qualify for the next part. Going from 20th or better, it breaks down to 16th or better, 12th or better, 8th or better, and 4th or better, before it's down to the last two racers who have to aim for first place to ultimately win.\nWe've also learned the names of the different possible courses you can race through in the Knockout mode, which are as follows: Golden Rally, Ice Rally, Moon Rally, Spiny Rally, Cheery Rally, Acorn Rally, Cloud Rally, and Heart Rally.\nIn Knockout Mode, Free Roam will also briefly act as a play lobby while you wait for players to join the session, with binocular stations dotted around the area that let you do some sightseeing in the interim. You'll also be able to send messages to other racers using the D-Pad on the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers.\nBattle Mode is also returning to the fold, with Balloon Battle and Coin Runners - two challenges that were in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. And of course, the Time Trial mode is also back to making use of the Switch 2's online features.\nMario Kart World tracks and courses\nBelow, we've listed all the tracks as well as the circuits in the Mario Kart World Grand Prix. There are 7 cups in total, each with four distinct tracks that range from never-seen-before courses to legacy hits from past Mario Kart games like Toad's Factory from Mario Kart Wii and Choco Mountain from Mario Kart 64.\nHere are all the tracks in the Mushroom Cup:\n- Mario Bros circuit\n- Crown City\n- Whistlestop Summit\n- DK Spaceport\nHere are all the tracks in the Flower Cup:\n- Desert Hills\n- Shy Guy Bazar\n- Wario Stadium\n- Airship Fortress\nHere are all the tracks in the Star Cup:\n- DK Pass\n- Starview Peak\n- Sky-High Sundae\n- Wario Shipyard\nHere are all the tracks in the Shell Cup:\n- Koopa Troopa Beach\n- Faraway Oasis\n- Crown City\n- Peach Stadium\nHere are all the tracks in the Banana Cup:\n- Peach Beach\n- Salty Salty Speedway\n- Dino Dino Jungle\n- Great ? Block ruins\nHere are all the tracks in the Leaf Cup:\n- Cheep Cheep beach\n- Dandelion Depths\n- Boo Cinema\n- Dry Bones Burnout\nHere are all the tracks in the Lightning Cup:\n- Moo Moo Meadows\n- Choco Mountain\n- Toad's Factory\n- Bowser's Castle\nMario Kart World characters\nThere are a ton of Mario Kart World characters that we'll be able to play as. The big showcase also confirmed that there are 24 placements in each race, which is a series first; we've only typically seen 12 racers on the track in previous games. Each character will also have a selection of different outfits to choose from, so you can speed against others in style.\nHere is a list of all the racers that we spotted in Mario Kart World so far, with new additions set to come as we discover more locked racers over the next few days:\n- Mario\n- Baby Mario\n- Luigi\n- Baby Luigi\n- Princess Peach\n- Baby Peach\n- Princess Daisy\n- Baby Daisy\n- Yoshi\n- Birdo\n- Toad\n- Toadette\n- Koopa Troopa\n- Dry Bones\n- Bowser\n- Baby Bowser\n- Wario\n- Waluigi\n- Rosalina\n- Baby Rosalina\n- Donkey Kong\n- Boo\n- Piranha Plant\n- Pauline\n- Shy Guy\n- Moo Moo Meadows cow\n- Stingby\n- Fish Bone\n- Goomba\n- Biddybud\n- Spike\n- Conkdor\n- Snowman\n- Pianta\n- Nabbit\n- Sidestepper\n- Swoop\n- Coin Coffer\n- Dolphin\n- Cataquack\n- Cheep Cheep\n- Pokey\n- Penguin\n- Peepa\n- Monty Mole\n- Wiggler\n- Lakitu\n- Hammer Bro\n- Rocky Wrench\nMario Kart World price\nMario Kart World price\nAccording to the official Nintendo website, the Mario Kart World price is $79.99 in the US. In the UK, the My Nintendo page states that the digital edition of the game comes in at \u00a366.99 while the physical version costs \u00a374.99.\nThis makes Mario Kart World much more expensive than its predecessor, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, with Switch 2 bundles combining with a copy of World coming in at $499.99.\nFor more on Nintendo, head over to our guide on where to buy the Switch 2 or read our Switch 2 review.\nAfter reviewing films throughout University and being a cosy game expert for years, I realised that entertainment journalism was my true calling in 2019.

      "text": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond \u2013 Everything we know so far about the upcoming Switch game\nMetroid Prime 4 is landing on Nintendo Switch in 2025, and Samus' return looks well worth the wait\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond is at last set to arrive this year after being the works for a number of years. First revealed with a very brief teaser back in 2017, Samus' upcoming return in a fresh adventure was even rebooted and changed hands over the course of development, but from what's been shown so far, it looks like it's going to be worth the wait.\nWith recent showcases - such as the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct and a Nintendo Treehouse stream - giving us some proper insight into the direction of the new Metroid Prime entry, we've gotten to see its Star Wars-style opening cutscene, alongside confirmation that it's going to be among the lineup of upcoming Switch 2 games set to come our way that will make use of the new-gen console's unique mouse controls in a\nWe're still awaiting that all important release date, but it's already shaping up to be one of the biggest new games for 2025, and rumors are already doing the rounds that we may well see of the upcoming adventure very soon. But with Retro Studios at the helm of the game and plenty of details now out in wild about what's in store, read on below to find out more about all things Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond release date speculation\nNintendo has confirmed that the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release date will be set for sometime in 2025, although the publisher is yet to confirm a firm date.\nIn June, there were unconfirmed reports that an advert for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was spotted in the London Underground with the information \"out now\" on the poster. The tube station that was reportedly running the AD was Oxford Circus Station; however, before we all start yelling \"it must have shadow dropped,\" Metroid Prime 4 isn't out yet, folks. If the advert was real, it was simply a mistake, as there is still no way to get your hands on the game yet.\nPokemon Legends Z-A coming in October and Donkey Kong Bananza now out as of July 17, we are betting on a November release, or possibly a December one for the holidays. We'll keep you posted as soon as we know more.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond platforms\nMetroid Prime 4 is set to land on Switch and will also be coming to the Switch 2.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 Direct confirmed Metroid Prime: 4 Beyond will be getting a Switch 2 Edition release alongside its launch on Switch. This version will run on the new-gen console with two different available modes: Quality mode runs at 4K 60FPS, while Performance mode runs at 1080p at 120FPS.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond trailer\nThe latest Metroid Prime 4 trailer debuted during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct. In this new teaser, we see Samus navigating the jungle planet of Viewros, where she must explore and scan mysterious statues to escape.\nHowever, Samus isn't alone and the trailer shows us plenty of exciting new enemies for us to blast. But, one of the most curious bits of information shared during this teaser is Samus' new psychic powers. The clip shows off abilities that will fling players towards enemies and assist in navigating the map as you can unlock doors.\nWhile that may sound like a big departure from the series, worry not! The trailer also has us occupying a first-person perspective as Samus navigates hostile environments, bringing back the FPS stylings of Metroid Prime 3 as she guns down enemies, and scans the corpses.\nMetroid Prime 4 screenshots\nNintendo released new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond screenshots. You can see these by scrolling through the gallery above, which should give you a good sense of the visual fidelity Nintendo is striving to deliver for this Switch release. You'll see Samus in combat with Space Pirates, some beautiful new environments, and get a glimpse at some returning abilities.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay\nThe Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay experience is going to be a delicate blend of quiet exploration, puzzle solving, and frantic shootouts, something the best Metroid games always capture with ease. You see these sides of play represented in the reveal trailer: Samus using her Scan Visor to assess the environment and gather information, shifting into her Morph Ball to explore new areas of the environment, and blasting away Space Pirates with her Power Beam and Missile Launcher.\nDuring a recent Nintendo Direct, we also saw that psychic abilities will be a new feature in the gameplay. You'll be able to use these powers to solve puzzles around the map, and control beams as you face off against enemies. From the most recent trailer for Metroid Prime 4, these new abilities will play a large part in the story, too.\nThe Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Switch 2 Edition will also make use of the Switch 2's new Joy-Con controller mouse-function, for more \"intuitive gameplay\". We saw during the Direct Showcase how this can be effectively used to direct and aim Samus' arm canon.\nIf you're looking to get a better idea of how Metroid Prime 4: Beyond may play, be sure to check out our glowing Metroid Prime Remastered review - which should convince you to pick up the classic!\nMetroid Prime 4 powers and abilities\nThere's still plenty more we need to learn about the game, but there's already some details that can be gleaned from the gameplay and trailers we've seen so far to pick out all the returning powers and abilities in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:\n- Power Suit\n- Power Beam\n- Missile Launcher\n- Morph Ball\n- Scan Visor\n- Psychic Abilities\nMetroid Prime 4 story\nThe Metroid Prime 4: Beyond story is still tightly under wraps, although we do know the general premise thanks to a recent Nintendo Treehouse presentation.\nThe game opens with Samus being tasked by the Galactic Federation to protect and defend an artifact from Space pirates. While trying to complete that objective, she sees that Metroids have seemingly teamed up with the game's main antagonist, Sylux, with the bounty hunter reappearing after their showing in Metroid Prime Hunters.\nWhile we are unsure about what happens next, we do know that the artifact will end up sending Samus to a new world. In previous trailers, we know that Samus will be trapped on an alien Jungle planet called Viewros. And after interacting with some statues, we also know that she'll be granted some ancient powers that give her psychic abilities. While we are still unclear on how she was trapped or why, Metroid Prime 4's story will focus on Samus trying to escape her current situation and get off this strange planet.\nWe're curious to discover more, especially regarding this uneasy alliance between the Space Pirates and Metroids.\nMetroid Prime 4's Sylux explained\nRetro Studios has confirmed that Sylux will play a massive role in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but who is this mysterious character? Little is known about this powerful bounty hunter, and that's despite multiple appearances in the series. So here's what I can tell you: Sylux carries a strong distrust of the Galactic Federation and views Samus Aran as an enemy for her association with the organization.\nSylux made their debut in 2004's Metroid Prime Hunters, attacking Samus as she explores the depths of the Vesper Defense Outpost. It's also believed that Sylux is piloting the ship that tracks Samus in the 'special ending' of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. There's a history here, so expect Sylux to be a formidable threat in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.\nWhy Metroid Prime 4 restarted development\nMetroid Prime 4 has been in some form of active development for nearly a decade \u2013 first teased in 2015, and later revealed at E3 2017.\nThe game was originally in development at Bandai Namco Studios, although it wasn't to be. Citing concerns over the quality of the production, Nintendo opted to restart development of Metroid Prime 4 in 2019 \u2013 handing the project over to Metroid Prime creator Retro Studios. It appears that everything is back on track now, with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond set to launch for Nintendo Switch - and Nintendo Switch 2 - in 2025.\nCheck out the best Switch 2 games to play while you wait for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.\nI started out writing for the games section of a student-run website as an undergrad, and continued to write about games in my free time during retail and temp jobs for a number of years.

      "text": "Donkey Kong Bananza: Everything we know so far about the new 3D adventure coming to Switch 2\nHere's everything you need to know about Donkey Kong Bananza\nDonkey Kong Bananza is bringing us a smashing new adventure starring the famous gorilla, and it's already shaping up to be one of the most exciting upcoming Switch 2 games on the near horizon. With the first official reveal coming during the Switch 2 April Direct, we've since gotten an even better picture of what's in store.\nWith some Treehouse presentations and a dedicated Direct, it was revealed that Donkey Kong's long awaited comeback will feature a young Pauline, and we've also seen some other familiar faces, such as Diddy Kong and Cranky Kong. After a lot of speculation, Nintendo officially confirmed that Bananza is coming to us from the same team that brough us Super Mario Odyssey, which you can definitely get a feel for in its gameplay.\nIt's been a long time since we've seen a 3D DK game, with the last one being Donkey Kong 64 on the N64 over two decades ago. That fact, coupled with lots of creative features, makes this one of the most exciting new games for 2025 that's set to come to the Switch 2. To find out more about what's in store, read on below as we breakdown everything we know so far about Donkey Kong Bananza.\nDonkey Kong Bananza release date\nNintendo revealed the Donkey Kong Bananza release date is set for July 17, 2025. That means we won't have to wait too long to reunite with the famous ape.\nWith the Direct confirming the Switch 2 set for launch on June 5, Donkey Kong's upcoming 3D adventure will be one of the earliest releases on the new console, alongside a lineup of Switch 2 launch games.\nDonkey Kong Bananza platforms\nNintendo confirmed Donkey Kong Bananza will be coming to the Switch 2.\nThe new-gen console will have backwards compatibility and some Switch games will be getting the Switch 2 Edition treatment, but Donkey Kong Bananza is new-gen only.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nIs Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch 1?\nIf you found yourself wondering whether or not Donkey Kong Bananza will be coming to Switch 1, you're not alone. Alas, Nintendo has confirmed DK's new 3D adventure will be a Switch 2 console exclusive.\nWhile this means you'll have to play on the new-gen console if you want to play solo, the GameShare support feature does mean that you can play in co-op locally on the Switch 1 as Pauline if another player activates the feature on the Switch 2 - but you'll still need the latest console.\nDonkey Kong Bananza trailer\nThe Donkey Kong Bananza trailer (which you can watch above) showed off some of the platforming levels that will be in store for us, from icy landscapes to jungle tundra, and more.\nAs a 3D adventure, it already looks very polished and inviting, and the platforming levels appear to be quite open-zoned in nature - in a similar vein to the likes of Kirby and the Forgotten. We also see plenty of smashing action as DK tears up the landscape above ground and below it.\nDonkey Kong Bananza gameplay\nWe got to see some glimpses of Donkey Kong Bananza gameplay in the announcement trailer, with DK crashing through the terrain in a variety of ways. From pulling up the earth, to crashing through the ground, and even bashing down below, we got to see some examples of the \"groundbreaking exploration\" that's in store for us.\nNintendo's official website for the game also sheds light on some gameplay details, including the fact that we'll be helping Donkey Kong make his way \"through the depths of the underground world\", and the \"deeper he goes, the more amazing places he finds.\" True to his nature, he also wants to get his hands on some shiny golden bananas, but a pesky mysterious group called VoidCo steals them. So, in hot pursuit of the a-peeling treasure, we have to help DK chase them down by heading underground.\nDescribed as a \"destructive\" adventure, there will be all manner of ways to traverse through the landscape and \"pulverize\" the environment with our monkey fists. In the trailer, we see lots of examples, from rail kart rides to climbing, rolling, and drilling down into the ground.\nIn a Nintendo Treehouse stream following the Switch 2 Direct, we got to take a closer look at some Donkey Bananza gameplay, which took us underground in a mining area. From seeing DK slap the ground to collect nearby items, to using chunks of terrain to clear obstacles, and break up the environment.\nDonkey Kong can also pull up turnips to find items, and tear off chunks from foes to gain the upper hand. How deep we'll be able to dig down will depend on the kind of terrain we're dealing with, but the Donkey Kong Bananza June Direct showed off how we can completely transform an environment.\nDuring our time playing the demo at the Switch 2 Experience, we also learned that you'll be able to smash the terrain around you using motion controls as well. There is also a 3D map that will reflect all your ape destruction, which updates as you change the world around you.\nAnd if you were planning to destroy the map completely, don't worry: there's a handy \"reset terrain\" feature that will make sure you never get stuck or miss out on anything either. For more, you can check out our Donkey Kong Bananza hands-on preview.\nDonkey Kong Bananza: Pauline\nDuring the June Direct, it was officially revealed that Donkey Kong Bananza will also feature Pauline. We were initially introduced to a little purple rock side-kick known as Odd Rock, which actually turns out to be a younger Pauline who's a talented singer that takes on the role of DK's companion.\nThe Direct details that Pauline is trying to find a way back home on the surface, while DK's is just after bananas, but with the promises of having any wish granted for those who reach the planet's core, the pair set out to make it there and have to work together to overcome challenges and obstacles. We see how she hitches a ride on DK's back as he climbs, smashes, and runs across the landscape.\nNintendo also confirmed that you can share a Joy-Con 2 controller with a pal so one can take control of DK, while the other plays as Pauline in two-player co-op. Pauline can make use of vocal blasts using the mouse functionality, and GameShare is also supported, so you can play locally with one copy of the game.\nDonkey Kong Bananza characters\nAlongside Donkey Kong and Pauline, we've seen lots of Donkey Kong Bananza characters so far.\nNintendo revealed the the main antagonists of the adventure, who are members of a group known as VoidCo, who are said to be stealing all of the bananas. So far we know that this group is make of new characters, including Grumpy Kong and Poppy Kong.\nWith plenty of footage in Treehouse streams, and confirmation of some of the familiar faces we'll be reuniting with and meeting in gameplay that was shown during the Donkey Kong Bananza Direct, you can find a list of all of the other characters we know about so far below.\n- Cranky Kong\n- Diddy Kong\n- Dixie Kong\n- Rambi the Rhino\nDonkey Kong Bananza transformations and collectibles\nThe Donkey Kong Bananza Direct gave us a look at a wealth of exciting features, including different transformations, collectibles, and skills.\nAs we explore the subterranean world, we'll come across Banadium Gems can be found behind walls, underground, out in the open, or earned by completing timed-battles, side-scrolling stages, and obstacle courses. When we collect these banana-shaped treasures, we'll earn skill points that can be put towards new skills.\nBanandium Chips are also peppered throughout the world that when found can be used as a form of currency by trading them for gold nuggets. You can then take the gold and buy items at the \"Stuff shop\". Fossils can also be unearthed as you explore, and these can be used to unlock new styles for Donkey Kong and Pauline - we even see that DK can change up his fur color. These new fashionable looks are also said to have useful benefits.\nAs DK, we'll be also be able able to adopt different Bananza transformations. These are activated through the power of Pauline's singing which can temporarily change Donkey Kong's form and enhance his destructive ability. By collecting gold to build up the pair's \"Bananergy\", Pauline's singing will then be able to trigger these transformations, and each one has its own specialty - such as the Ostrich Bananza which we see allows DK to fly through the air and drop eggs on foes, as well as the Zebra Bananza that makes him faster and lets you dash in short bursts.\nDonkey Kong Bananza Amiibo\nThe June Direct also revealed a new Donkey Kong Bananza and Pauline Amiibo, as well confirming it will feature Amiibo support for every Amiibo that's released so far.\nThe Donkey Kong Bananza amiibo that features Pauline will available on July 17th, and allows you to unlock a special Diva Dress early, as well as dropping explosive Kong tiles that you can placed and thrown. The Donkey Kong range of Amiibos that have previously released will also give you gold Kong tiles, while scanning other Amiibo will make giant spheres of terrain appear.\nOur guide on where to pre-order the new Switch 2 Donkey Banaza amiibo is here to help if you're looking to snatch up the pair.\nCan I pre-order Donkey Kong Bananza?\nWith Switch 2 pre-orders live, you can also now pre-order Donkey Kong Bananza ahead of its launch this July, but there doesn't appear to be any associated Donkey Kong Bananza pre-order bonus.\nThe Donkey Bananza price has also also been confirmed, with the digital and physical versions available to purchase for $69.99 from the official Nintendo store. Digital copies in the UK retail at \u00a358.99, while the physical version clocks in at \u00a366.99. Pre-orders are also live at some of the biggest retailers.\nWhile we wait for this new adventure to arrive, look back on the previous consoles highlights with our pick of the best Switch exclusives.\nI started out writing for the games section of a student-run website as an undergrad, and continued to write about games in my free time during retail and temp jobs for a number of years. Eventually, I earned an MA in magazine journalism at Cardiff University, and soon after got my first official role in the industry as a content editor for Stuff magazine. After writing about all things tech and games-related, I then did a brief stint as a freelancer before I landed my role as a staff writer here at GamesRadar+. Now I get to write features, previews, and reviews, and when I'm not doing that, you can usually find me lost in any one of the Dragon Age or Mass Effect games, tucking into another delightful indie, or drinking far too much tea for my own good.\n- Emma-Jane BettsManaging Editor, Evergreens\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

  "argos_summary": "Nintendo has repeatedly postponed the Switch\u00a02 launch to give its first\u2011party developers more time to polish flagship titles, notably Mario\u202fKart\u202fWorld and Donkey\u202fKong\u202fBananza, according to a Bloomberg report. The company prioritises perfection over speed, citing fan and third\u2011party frustration, and maintains a large cash reserve to support long\u2011term projects. This strategy has delayed the console\u2019s release despite strong demand and has raised concerns about the pace of future Nintendo titles.",
