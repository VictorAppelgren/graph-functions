Although Beltrami County damage estimates clock in at $8.3 million, the state as a whole fell short by $800,000.\n\nHowever, Beltrami County's damage far exceeded the DACA threshold of $109,000. Now, the state will provide a 75% reimbursement toward publicly damaged infrastructure, while the county will cover the rest. Those with damage to private structures must rely on personal insurance and other means.\n\n\"Minnesota is committed to supporting communities in Northwest and West Central Minnesota as they recover from June's storms, which brought hurricane-force winds, severe flooding and widespread damage,\" Walz said in a release. \"When I\n\nwith the state emergency management team, we witnessed neighbors helping neighbors, demonstrating a resilience that reflects the very best of Minnesota.\n\n\"We will continue to stand with them for the long recovery ahead. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the emergency responders whose tireless work and partnership have been critical to the recovery effort.\"\n\nIf the state qualified for FEMA, the federal government would have provided a 75% reimbursement while the state would be expected to cover the remaining 25%, providing complete relief to individual counties.\n\nInstead, the affected jurisdictions, including White Earth Nation, Cass, Clearwater, Hubbard, Mahnomen, Norman and Todd Counties, will share individual recovery costs with the state.\n\nA release from Beltrami County Emergency Management added that DACA exists for this purpose and was initially developed after a storm ravaged Beltrami County in 2012, causing significant damage, yet not qualifying for federal aid.\n\nBeltrami County now finds itself in the same situation and will use available resources to continue its recovery effort.",
