      "summary": "The average 30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage in the U.S. is 6.522%, up 3 basis points from yesterday and down 1 basis point from a week ago, reflecting a continued near‑7% plateau since January 2025.  Fed policy has stalled rate cuts and the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction is keeping rates high, while inflation expectations and labor‑market tightness support a 6–7% range for the foreseeable future.  Buyers can still mitigate costs through rate buydowns or refinancing, but overall rates are unlikely to fall below the mid‑6% level without a significant shift in inflation or monetary policy.",
