Risk case: 7.2 %–7.5 % if Fed hikes or inflation spikes (LF0UUL917).”\n\n7. **Watch List & Confidence**  \n   - Add a concise watch list and confidence rating.  \n   - **Edit**: “Watch: Fed minutes, CPI, debt‑issuance schedule; Confidence: moderate (±0.2 %).”\n\n8. **Remove Redundant Sentences**  \n   - Any sentence that does not tie back to a canonical handle or the causal chain should be removed or rewritten.  \n   - Example: “The U.S. national debt, now a substantial burden, exerts a drag on rates…” → keep only the part that links debt to the term‑premium component.\n\n**Revised Paragraph (sample)**  \n> Mortgage rates are **+1 bp** relative to",
