      "feedback": "The draft satisfies most criteria but needs tightening: 1) add an explicit “spx” reference in every line to satisfy canonical‑handle mapping; 2) insert a brief causal link (e.g., “Fed cut → lower 10‑yr yield → risk‑premium easing → spx +0.5‑1.0%”) to meet the transmission‑path rule; 3) split the overlapping Aug 29‑Sep 5 window into two distinct windows—one for the Tesla lawsuit outcome (Aug 29‑30) and one for AI‑sector earnings weakness (Sep 1‑5)—or combine them only if the same catalyst drives both; 4) adjust probabilities to reflect source confidence (Fed cut 70%, Tesla lawsuit 35% favorable, concentration risk 45%, AI weakness 30%) and include a brief invalidation clause (e.g., “earlier Fed cut or core PCE <2.5% would flip the bias”); 5) add missing citations for the magnitude ranges (e.g., B1KYJ1GPU for Fed cut, LJZYDXVL3 for Tesla, CG8ZKHFI2/FAN5RYW6T for concentration, 5GZPY1XUE/3YAQ8JUPL for AI); 6) keep each line a single sentence, no period at the end, and avoid filler words. These edits will ensure full compliance with the format, mapping, and causal‑chain requirements.",
