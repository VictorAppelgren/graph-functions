  "title": "FanDuel Adds Stock Betting\u2014And Robinhood Adds Football: What To Know As Wall Street Meets Sportsbooks",
  "description": "The popular sports betting app will soon host event-based contracts linked to oil and gas prices, gold, the S&P 500 and more.",
  "content": "Bettors will soon be able to wager on market movements, inflation, the price of gas and gold on FanDuel as part of a partnership between the popular sports betting platform and the derivatives exchange CME Group, further narrowing the gap between sportsbooks and Wall Street after the investing platform Robinhood announced an expansion into football wagering. The popular sports betting app will soon host event-based contracts linked to oil and gas prices, gold, the S&P 500 and more.\n\nFanDuel\u2019s parent firm Flutter Entertainment and CME Group announced a joint venture Wednesday to \u201cexpand access to financial markets\u201d for FanDuel customers, with event-based contracts listed on the FanDuel app that will be subject to CME Group\u2019s regulations. The partnership will allow bettors to wager multiple times per day on contracts linked to the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, oil and gas prices and cryptocurrencies, as well as economic data like gross domestic product and inflation, the companies said, noting other unspecified offerings would be determined \u201cin the coming months.\u201d Bettors will express their views with \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d positions for as little as $1, the companies said in a statement, and the partnership does not allow users to actually buy or sell stocks on FanDuel. Event-based contracts on FanDuel are expected to launch later this year\n\nFanDuel\u2019s announcement came one day after Robinhood launched pro and college football prediction markets within the online broker\u2019s app. Bettors will now be able to wager on the outcomes of both regular season NFL matchups and college football games involving the Southeastern Conference, the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big Ten Conference and the Big 12 Conference, according to Robinhood. Prediction markets for these games will roll out with the first two weeks of the pro and college football seasons, Robinhood said, with plans to add weekly matchups as the season progresses. The football prediction markets are expected to be tradeable each day between 8 a.m. EDT and 3 a.m., Robinhood said. In July, Robinhood CFO Jason Warnick told CNBC that nearly $1 billion in sports and non-sports events contracts were traded through its first quarter, adding the firm foresaw \u201ca big opportunity\u201d in sports betting. As of Thursday, Robinhood was taking bets on the NFL regular season opener between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys, along with Saturday\u2019s college matchup between Kansas State and Iowa State.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nWhether fellow sports betting platform DraftKings adds prediction markets. Oppenheimer analyst Jed Kelly suggested in a note last month that DraftKings and Flutter Entertainment were looking to become more proactive with prediction market offerings, complementing a rise in sports betting revenue in recent years. Analysts from Jefferies wrote Thursday that DraftKings will likely enter the prediction market space by acquiring Railbird, which operates a federally regulated prediction market and event contract exchange.\n\n$147.9 billion. That\u2019s how much Americans wagered on sports betting in 2024, a 23.6% increase over the previous year, according to the American Gaming Association. More than 95% of these bets were placed online.\n\nNew betting opportunities on FanDuel and Robinhood add to a developing landscape among the prediction marketplace. Betting platforms Crypto.com and Kalshi have launched sports contracts in recent months, while Polymarket said a return to the U.S. was in the works three years after it was blocked for failing to register as a derivatives trading platform. Polymarket and Kalshi have become popular platforms for bettors to wager on elections, the recent papal conclave and other scenarios, including whether Elon Musk and President Donald Trump would mend their strained relationship. Betting on sports and politics on derivatives exchanges faced criticism under the Biden administration. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Kalshi in 2023 over its betting offerings for Senate and House election results, arguing the bets could sway polling. An appeals court ruled in favor of Kalshi in October 2024 and allowed users to wager on elections.\n\nSeveral states have issued cease-and-desist orders against Kalshi in recent months, including Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio and Illinois, arguing Kalshi has allowed sports-related prediction contracts on its site despite statewide bans on sports betting. Kalshi has disputed the orders, arguing the platform is regulated by the CFTC, not state gaming officials.",

      "text": "Topline\nA federal appeals court Wednesday lifted an earlier ruling that blocked Americans from betting on the outcome of congressional elections, following challenges from regulators, which claimed the bets could harm the integrity of U.S. elections.\nKey Facts\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously Tuesday the prediction market Kalshi could allow users to bet on which political party would control the House or Senate in 2025.\nThe ruling lifts a block issued by the court last month after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission motioned to prohibit the bets, arguing betting on congressional elections would \u201cthreaten election integrity\u201d by creating incentives for voters to support specific candidates.\nThe CFTC failed to provide sufficient evidence indicating the \u201cpublicly will be irreparably injured,\u201d the court ruled, adding the agency could renew a bid to block the bets \u201cshould substantiating evidence arise.\u201d\nNeither the CFTC nor Kalshi immediately responded to requests for comment.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nWhat To Watch For\nA Kalshi spokesperson told CoinDesk the company would allow betting on election outcomes \u201cvery soon,\u201d though it did not provide a timetable.\nKey Background\nThe CFTC has challenged efforts for betting markets in the U.S. to allow wagers on congressional elections for years. The agency has refused to grant gambling platforms a license to provide odds on election results, though some international markets\u2014including Polymarket and PredictIt\u2014provide odds and allow users to wager. Betting on elections is not illegal at the federal level, though it is outlawed in some states, including Texas and Nevada. Kalshi, a New York-based predictions market, was sued by the CFTC in November 2023 over its betting offerings for Senate and House election results. Kalshi then sued the CFTC while seeking to overturn the agency\u2019s decision preventing it from allowing those bets. A lower court ruled in favor of Kalshi on Sept. 6, a decision that was supported by the U.S. Court of Appeals a week later, briefly allowing Kalshi to offer congressional wagers before the block was put in place.\nSurprising Fact\nKalshi users were allowed to bet on congressional election outcomes for about eight hours before the appeals court blocked those wagers, according to the Associated Press. During that period, users could pay a minimum of 76 cents to bet on Republicans winning the Senate and 63 cents on the Democrats winning the House. A $100 wager on either bet would have profited $29 and $54, respectively."

Together, the companies will develop new fully funded, event-based contracts with defined risk. Customers will be able to express their views multiple times a day on a wide range of markets with simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d positions for as little as $1.\nExpected to launch later this year, the products will include benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100, prices of oil and gas, gold, cryptocurrencies, and key economic indicators such as GDP and CPI, with further details of additional offerings to be determined in the coming months.\n\u201cIndividual investors are increasingly sophisticated and continually pursuing new financial opportunities,\u201d said Terry Duffy, CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cTo meet this demand, we have created this innovative partnership, which will operate a non-clearing FCM.

We are excited to be partnering with CME Group to design new and engaging products, combining innovation with best-in-class regulatory compliance and consumer protections.\u201d\nAs part of the partnership, CME Group and FanDuel will form a new joint venture, under which they will operate a non-clearing futures commission merchant (FCM) that will facilitate access to these event-based contracts through FanDuel.\nPending CFTC regulatory review, event contracts will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME Group exchanges and available through all participating FCMs.\nForward looking statements\nThis press release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

      "text": "Robinhood beat Wall Street expectations for the second quarter Wednesday, extending a hot streak that has made it the best-performing large-cap U.S. tech stock this year.\nHere is how Robinhood's results compared to Wall Street estimates, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: 42 cents vs. 31 cents expected\n- Revenue: $989 million vs. $908 million expected\nRevenue jumped 45% year-over-year to $989 million, while net income more than doubled to $386 million, up 105% from the same quarter last year.\nThe number of funded customers climbed by 2.3 million to 26.5 million, topping the StreetAccount estimate of 26.1 million. Investment accounts also grew 10% year-over-year to 27.4 million.\nTotal platform assets nearly doubled, rising 99% from a year earlier to $279 billion, driven by strong net deposits, acquired assets, and higher equity and cryptocurrency valuations, according to the release.\nRobinhood is closing the gap with Coinbase as it pushes beyond retail trading into full-scale wealth management. The company has been aggressively offering deposit matches to lure clients from Fidelity and Schwab, and assets under management have grown with its TradePMR acquisition.\nTotal operating expenses increased 12% to $550 million. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating expenses and share-based compensation rose 6% to $522 million, reflecting costs tied to the Bitstamp acquisition.\nTransaction-based revenue, which is a proxy for trading activity, came in at $539 million, ahead of StreetAccount's $517 million estimate. Options trading contributed $265 million, beating the $250 million estimate, while crypto and equities revenue were slightly below forecasts, signaling a tilt toward higher-margin derivatives trading.\nCryptocurrency trading came in light of estimates at $160 million versus $168 million expected, and equities also missed StreetAccount's estimate at $66 million versus $69 million expected.\nNet interest revenue was $357 million, beating expectations of $306 million. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 82% to $549 million, well above estimates of $448 million.\nAverage revenue per user rose 34% year-over-year to $151, topping the $142 consensus.\nRobinhood Gold subscribers, which provide customers with higher cash sweep rates, larger instant deposits and enhanced research tools, increased by 1.5 million, up 76% to 3.5 million users.\n\"We're making a lot of progress in what I would call more passive, long-term areas,\" CFO Jason Warnick told CNBC. \"At the end of Q2 we had $19 billion in retirement accounts, and we're already over $20 billion. A million and a half customers have retirement accounts, and we think there's a lot of room for more customers to set up retirement accounts and start compounding benefits early.\"\nIn the company's earnings call, Warnick said Robinhood's new betting and prediction markets have also taken off, with customers trading nearly $1 billion worth of contracts last quarter and more than $2 billion cumulatively since launch. He said engagement is strongest in sports wagers but hinted at plans to expand into broader cultural and news-driven markets.\nCEO Vlad Tenev said the company sees \"a big opportunity\" in sports betting and is building out technology to support \"lots of different types of contracts,\" with plans to broaden its offerings further.\nTenev also teased the launch of Robinhood Banking this fall, saying the new product will let customers \"bring even more of their assets\" onto the platform.\n\"We just rolled this out internally to the full employee base. It's really good,\" Tenev said. \"I think you're really going to like it. It's a very innovative offering.\"\nDespite an earnings beat, shares slipped during the call after Warnick said that costs tied to the company's Bitstamp acquisition will total roughly $65 million in 2025, bringing full-year adjusted operating expenses and stock-based compensation costs to between $2.15 billion and $2.25 billion. That doesn't include anticipated costs from the pending WonderFi acquisition or provisions for credit losses.\nHeading into the report, Robinhood's stock was up more than 180% this year, outpacing every tech company valued at $5 billion or more, following a 192% gain in 2024.\nDespite its meteoric rise, Robinhood was excluded from the S&P 500 last month \u2014 a move that surprised some investors, especially as rival fintech Block was added.\nInvestors have been watching closely for updates on Robinhood's expansion into crypto infrastructure and tokenized finance \u2014 particularly after its launch of synthetic stock tokens for OpenAI and SpaceX. The assets, which trade in Europe via Robinhood's crypto platform, give users indirect exposure through special purpose vehicles \u2014 but drew immediate backlash.\nOpenAI publicly disavowed the offering, warning users that the tokens are not OpenAI equity and were issued without the company's approval. Robinhood defended the rollout, calling it a way to expand access to pre-IPO markets, and said it built the program to withstand regulatory scrutiny.\nWATCH: Robinhood heads into earnings on Wall Street hot streak"
