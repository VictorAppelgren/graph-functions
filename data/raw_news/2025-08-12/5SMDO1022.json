  "description": "Gov. Glenn Youngkin outlines Virginia's human trafficking efforts at annual conference, crediting Trump administration support for enhanced federal cooperation.",
  "content": "Gov. Glenn Youngkin laid out his plans to address human trafficking during an annual conference Tuesday, saying the Trump administration has been a shot in the arm to state law enforcement as it attempts to tackle the elusive issue.\n\nYoungkin, joined by Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and other state attorneys general, compared human trafficking enforcement to addressing transnational gangs.\n\n\"We must have multi-state and federal support in order to dismantle the networks, not just arrest an individual, we've got to unpack the networks,\" Youngkin told a crowd of a few hundred.\n\nThe Trump administration has been a boon to human trafficking enforcement efforts, Youngkin said, noting he met with top Justice Department officials at the White House after the inauguration to discuss the matter and found them receptive. Virginia law enforcement has since been coordinating with the federal government to take down foreign gang operations, which Youngkin said overlaps with the human trafficking space. Youngkin used the example of gang crime inside correctional centers, which he said was the first \"thread\" his team pulled.\n\n\"We were able to unpick [MS-13 gangs] from their phones,\" Youngkin said. \"What we found was an immense network being run out of incarcerated criminals, and once the FBI tools and the Homeland Security tools and the state police tools could all be unleashed, in the FBI regional headquarters here in Northern Virginia, a map went up on the wall of the organization, and it's just like any other work chart.\"\n\nMiyares said in an interview with Fox News Digital he made requests to the Biden administration for an interagency task force to address MS-13, Tren de Aragua and other gangs but that the requests were made \"on deaf ears.\" He said that, by contrast, the Trump administration has acted quickly.\n\n\"It's not just drug trafficking. Human trafficking is a huge component of it.\u2026 Within 30 days, [the Trump administration] had both approved it and given us interagency space at the FBI field office in Manassas, a huge space where we had both federal, state and local law enforcement working together,\" Miyares said.\n\nIn March, the U.S. attorney for Eastern Virginia announced the task force had made 342 arrests, \"many of them with illegal status,\" and that 81 had \"gang or transnational crime affiliation.\"\n\nHuman trafficking violations are governed largely by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, a law passed more than two decades ago. Incidents can involve a person forcing or coercing another person into performing labor or sexual acts. The perpetrators tend to target children, women and vulnerable people, such as those living in economic hardship, fleeing natural disasters or struggling psychologically.\n\nYoungkin said human trafficking is an \"ill-defined\" problem.\n\nMiyares echoed those sentiments, saying human trafficking violations were \"multifaceted.\" He cited instances of missing children in his state and an arrest made in 2022 after migrants were discovered working illegally in a laundry facility in Williamsburg.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey told Fox News Digital in an interview after the event that trafficking cases \"all look so very different\" but that foster children in his state were particularly susceptible. He said he hopes to harness artificial intelligence to use data across agencies to get a firmer grasp on the issue.\n\n\"I think the biggest next step is building these communication bridges between agencies.\u2026 Because once a kid is found, [police] need to know everything immediately, and it needs to all be in one centralized place so that a correct decision can be made very, very quickly,\" McCuskey said. \"Because these things happen fast, and a kid's life can be ruined in a day and a half because an adult made the wrong decision based on bad intervention.\"",

The task force was cofounded by the OAG and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\nAccording to allegations in the indictment, Ana Patricia Landaverde, 47, of Williamsburg, Jeffrey Dean Vaughan, 64, of Williamsburg, and George William Evans, 68, of Midlothian, engaged in a conspiracy to harbor, transport, and benefit from the employment of undocumented noncitizens at their commercial laundry business, Northstar Holdings of Virginia LLC, d/b/a Magnolia Cleaning Services, LLC. Between the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2022, the business's wage records reflect approximately 121 employees with alleged invalid or mismatched Social Security Numbers and wage payments of more than $1.2 million to these employees.\nThe fourth unnamed defendant is alleged to have acted as an illegal supplier of fraudulent identification documents. Prospective employees without proper documentation to work in the United States were allegedly referred to this defendant to purchase a counterfeit permanent resident card and social security card.\n\"Human trafficking can occur anytime, anywhere, oftentimes in plain sight and in this case, in our own backyard,\u201d said Attorney General Miyares. \"I'm proud of the work the Hampton Roads Human Trafficking Taskforce did in leading this investigation.\u201d\nAs further set forth in the indictment, Landaverde, Vaughan, and Evans also allegedly engaged in human trafficking of labor from Central America and benefitting from forced labor. One victim is alleged to have been brought to the United States when she was only 13 years old and forced to work nights while also attending school during the day. Allegations also include another victim being made to work under threats of deportation, physical violence, and other misuse of law and process. This same victim was made to pay rent to live in the commercial laundry facility where she lacked access to a kitchen, shower, or bath.\n\"These indictments are a great example of what can be accomplished when federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies work in collaboration,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Derek W. Gordon of HSI Washington, D.C. \"We will continue our partnerships with our law enforcement partners, through the Hampton Roads Human Trafficking Task Force. HSI will work tirelessly to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations, like this one, in order to keep our communities safe from all criminal elements who would do harm to our law-abiding residents.\u201d\nMore information can be found on the website of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

Jay Jones secured the Democratic nomination for Virginia attorney general.\nThe Associated Press projects that Jones has won the Democratic primary and will challenge incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares this November.\nMiyares was elected attorney general in 2021 alongside Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited this year, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican gubernatorial nominee. All three Republicans flipped Democratic seats during the statewide elections in 2021, and Democrats are seeking to regain control of Virginia later this year.\nPresident Donald Trump's name did not appear at the top of the ticket during Virginia's primary on Tuesday, but his sweeping second-term agenda took center stage up and down the ballot.\nTRUMP FACTOR: ELECTIONS IN THIS KEY STATE ARE SEEN AS A PARTIAL REFERENDUM ON THE PRESIDENT\nMiyares, the first Hispanic American to be elected to a statewide office in Virginia and the first child of an immigrant to be attorney general, has been supportive of Trump's agenda in Virginia \u2013 whereas Democratic attorneys general across the United States have led the judicial challenge to Trump's executive authority.\nTRUMP NOT ON BALLOT BUT PRESIDENT INFLUENCES TUESDAY'S HIGH-STAKES PRIMARY\nJones and his competitor, Henrico Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor, both tried to capitalize on primary voters\u2019 anger over the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the federal government, including massive layoffs through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nJones, a former assistant attorney general, identified his top campaign issue as protecting Virginia from the Trump administration.\n\"Donald Trump is waging an unprecedented assault on Virginia communities, jobs, and even civil rights,\" Jones included in a statement on his campaign website.\nJones applauded how attorneys general have stepped up to defend Americans by suing the Trump administration to unlock federal funding and reject executive overreach, \"but here in Virginia, MAGA extremist Attorney General Jason Miyares has put politics first and refused to join in the effort to defend against unconstitutional and un-American Trump policies.\"\nPublic safety, lowering costs through corporate accountability, protecting civil and constitutional rights and preserving the right to abortion were among Jones' additional campaign promises.\nTaylor's campaign focused on public safety, protecting abortion rights, lowering costs, preventing gun violence and building Virginia's economy to support the middle class.\nTaylor's first campaign ad featured images of Trump buying a Tesla at the White House and Elon Musk holding up a chainsaw at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).\n\"I'm running for Attorney General to beat back Trump and Musk,\" Taylor said.\nVirginia's elections will be used by political pundits and politicians as a bellwether for competitive midterm elections expected in 2026. They are an early opportunity to gauge how Americans are responding to Trump's second term, and see how they might vote next year when a congressional majority is on the line.\nVirginia is one of two gubernatorial elections in the United States this year, along with New Jersey, which held their primary election last week.\nCommonwealth Republicans broke a 12-year losing streak to the Democrats when they swept the elections for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in Virginia four years ago.\nBut Republicans haven't won the commonwealth in a White House contest since 2004.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTrump lost the state by six points in last November's presidential election, which was a four-point improvement from his 2020 defeat.\nStill, Republicans are expected to face an upward battle in November. With only one exception since 1977, the party that holds the White House has lost Virginia's gubernatorial election.\nFox News Digital's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report."

      "text": "Dozens of children were rescued in a blow to child sex trafficking operations in Florida, officials announced Monday.\nDubbed Operation Dragon Eye, the initiative was spearheaded by the U.S. Marshals Office for the Central District of Florida and supported by the state Attorney General James Uthmeier\u2019s Office of Statewide Prosecution (OSP).\nThe effort involved 20 agencies working in tandem to locate 60 critically missing children and apprehend suspects tied to trafficking, drugs and child endangerment.\n\"The real heroes behind this operation are the law enforcement who built and executed this mission,\" Uthmeier said in a release. \"As your Attorney General and a father of three young kids, protecting children is my top priority. If you victimize children, you're going to prison, end of story.\"\nAuthorities said the recovered children ranged in age from 9 to 17, and many of them were missing and at risk of being exploited. The U.S. Marshals Service defines \"critically missing\" children as \"those at risk of crimes of violence or those with other elevated risk factors such as substance abuse, sexual exploitation, crime exposure or domestic violence.\"\nThe operation uncovered the gut-wrenching realities of sex trafficking \u2014 including several young girls who were pregnant, one of them carrying the child of her trafficker.\nOfficials stressed that the operation didn\u2019t end with their rescue, but each child received immediate medical evaluations and psychological support, with long-term care protocols set in motion.\n\"The unique part of this operation was the fact that underaged critically missing children were not only recovered but were debriefed and provided with physical and psychological care,\" said U.S. Marshal William Berger. \"This operation further included follow-up assistance in hopes that these youths will not return back to the streets to be further victimized.\"\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) also played a central role in the operation. Commissioner Mark Glass assured the parents of missing children that the department will \"never stop searching.\"\n\"Sixty kids saved. That number sends the message that Florida will never be a safe place for traffickers,\" Glass said. \"At FDLE, we will continue to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. And to any family still missing their child, we will never stop searching until we make sure they are brought home safely.\"\n205 ARRESTED IN FBI CHILD SEX OPERATION, PATEL AND BONDI ANNOUNCE\nEight individuals were arrested during the operation, the agency said. They face a variety of charges, including human trafficking, child endangerment, drug possession and drug trafficking. Authorities say the investigation is ongoing, and additional charges may follow.\nThe Office of Statewide Prosecution is handling the criminal cases, with support from state attorneys in the Sixth and Thirteenth Judicial Circuits. Special Counsel Rita Peters has been appointed to lead the prosecution in the human trafficking case, while two additional trafficking cases remain under investigation.\nSex trafficking continues to pose a persistent threat in Florida, with the state among the top three in the nation for reported human trafficking cases, alongside California and Texas, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.\nIn 2024 alone, according to the agency, Florida received over 1,830 signals, which led to the identification of 1,874 victims. The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) found that many victims are minors between the ages of 11 and 17, often lured through manipulation or online platforms.\nIn response, Florida leaders have stepped up both funding and legislative efforts. Gov. Ron DeSantis recently allocated $4.9 million to expand emergency shelter beds and staff support for trafficking victims, while an additional $900,000 in grant funding was provided to the FDLE.\nWATCH:\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Florida is being proactive about stopping human trafficking,\" DeSantis previously said. \"Though our open southern border invites criminal activity like human trafficking, states can combat it with stronger penalties and increased training for emergency personnel to recognize and respond to trafficking, and today I was pleased to institute those measures in Florida.\"\nState lawmakers have also passed legislation to increase penalties for traffickers and mandate trafficking-awareness training for hotel workers, healthcare providers and school staff.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Uthmeier's office for comment."
