      "feedback": "Actionable edit notes: tighten the causal chain by tying each Up/Down line to a clear, first‑principles transmission (inflation dynamics, policy reaction, discount‑rate path, and price of risk) and explicitly map Regime A/B/C triggers to observable market outcomes, citing anchors like real‑rate differentials, term structure, productivity, and BoP (per Y6SQOEK69; 22PL3Q360; 15); enforce the 4-line format with exactly one sentence each, ensuring the Time window, Driver/Mechanism, What to watch, and Probability % are crisp, grounded in the specific facts from the sources (e.g., July CPI +0.3%, 10–34% tariff frame with 145% spikes, Ford metrics, PFE/ABBV/ABT yields) and avoiding generic statements; replace any generic framing with concrete catalysts (CPI prints and Fed guidance for Regime shift; tariff headlines for tail risk; LOE/pipeline milestones and regulatory readouts for pharma) and explicit invalidation rules (policy rollback risk or LOE shocks) anchored to LLN6N4H3Z; increase numerical grounding by locking each line to the cited numbers (upfront HVAC uplift ~$1,500 and replacement $13k–$14k for the HVAC piece; Ford EV losses ~$1.3B, adj EBIT ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1%; pharma cash flow and payout data from WISLWAJ15) and calibrate Probability % as scenario weights only where the sources imply likelihood, otherwise present as clearly labeled High/Med/Low bands; ensure comprehensive coverage and reconciliation across critical sources (SGB2PAZGK; STBVARD8F; 22PL3Q360; WISLWAJ15; LLN6N4H3Z; 9; 15; Y6SQOEK69) so the four lines reflect a coherent, non‑conflicting view.",
