      "feedback": "Your draft lays a plausible high‑level link between AI‑driven productivity, policy shifts, and equity dynamics, but it falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year analysis. Actionable edits: (1) lock in a rigorous, horizon‑focused regime framework built on first principles—define invariant anchors (real rate/monetary policy stance, terms of trade, productivity growth from AI, BoP/net external position, and policy reaction functions), and specify at least three regimes with explicit transition conditions (e.g., unemployment and inflation thresholds, external balances, tariff posture shifts). State a base case, upside, and downside path, with clear regime triggers (tariff escalations, AI capex breakthroughs, or a UBI/Psychological‑identity policy pivot). (2) articulate a tight causal chain from policy/technology shocks to market pricing, including the transmission mechanisms: AI‑driven capex in semis/data infrastructure, energy reliability for data centers (as noted in Trump‑era AI/high‑energy buildout framing), tariff pass‑through to consumer prices, and reallocation of capital toward “strategic” sectors; connect these to external balance dynamics and macro risk premia. (3) enhance quantification by tying every qualitative claim to numbers from sources: exposed share of jobs (≈25% high automation exposure per Brookings in NL5YYTLF2), observed Ford metrics (17% YTD gain; forward P/E ~8–10; ~5% dividend yield; ROIC around 10%), and total‑return framing (dividends plus price moves from 4). Where sources conflict (e.g., tariff levels: 10% baseline vs 145% Chinese tariffs vs “80%” rhetoric in Fox material), present a structured tariff sensitivity with a plausible range (e.g., baseline 10%, escalations to 125–145% in variant scenarios) and state impact channels rather than asserting a single outcome. (4) reorganize to satisfy SECTION FOCUS: present an explicit base case first, then lay out regimes, catalysts, and invalidation flags; quantify base‑case macro figures (growth, inflation, external balance, capex, EV profitability) drawn from the cited sources, and flag key risks with thresholds to watch. (5) sharpen catalysts/triggers/invalidation: measurable events such as capex announcements in AI/semis, EV profitability milestones, tariff announcements/tassage, and university curricula shifts; and specify clear invalidation tests (e.g., if UBI‑to‑identity policies fail to dampen mental‑health spillovers or unemployment resilience improves faster than automation, invalidate the bear case). (6) tighten source discipline and reconciliation: cite NL5YYTLF2 for identity/UBI psychology, 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW for Ford/auto cyclicality and ROIC, SGB2PAZGK for tariff/China strategy, and the total‑return/ROIC pieces (4 and 6) to ground valuation framing; explicitly acknowledge any tensions (e.g., near‑term inflation risk from tariffs vs longer‑run productivity gains) rather than smoothing them over. (7) avoid generic platitudes by inserting targeted micro‑numbers (EV unit‑sales trajectory, battery/capability investment levels, specific ROIC/WACC comparisons) and by mapping each to a cited source. (8) ensure the final piece delivers true world‑class coherence: a transparent, testable chain from AI/industrial policy to asset pricing, with a single base‑case $/inflation forecast, regime‑dependent equity implications (Ford vs broader autos), and a concise watchlist of indicators to validate or refute the central thesis.",
