  "content": "For many people chasing financial independence, retire early, better known as FIRE, the goal is straightforward: save aggressively, invest wisely and eventually ditch the 9-to-5.\n\nBut for a growing group within the FIRE community, early retirement doesn\u2019t mean not working at all. It just means doing work they actually enjoy, even if it\u2019s low-paying or outside their original field. That\u2019s where Barista FIRE comes in.\n\nBarista FIRE is about hitting a point where your investments can cover most of your expenses, but you pick up a part-time or low-stress job to either supplement income or keep yourself active and social. It\u2019s not always about coffee shops. For some, it\u2019s a ski patrol gig. For others, it\u2019s a public library, a yoga studio or even the local hardware store.\n\u2022 The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\u2022 Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nOne Redditor put it recently said: \u201cI'm a doctor working at a hobby shop. They asked why I wanted to do it. I said I like hobbies and was done being a doctor. Been a few super fun months now.\u201d\n\nThat comment resonated with others who were either pursuing Barista FIRE or already living it. Another replied, \u201cAs a doctor about to barista fire this gives me hope. Working in a hobby shop sounds more fun than most retail!\u201d The doctor agreed, saying they look forward to work, laugh more than they had in years, and spend time around people who are genuinely happy to be there. \"Plus,\" they added, \"the deals are amazing!\"\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets \u2014 Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nWorried About Being Overqualified? You\u2019re Not Alone\n\nMany Barista FIRE hopefuls transitioning out of demanding careers worry about being seen as \u201ctoo qualified\u201d for low-wage or part-time roles. One financial consultant with a Master of Business Administration and 17 years of experience said they were nervous employers would dismiss them outright. \u201cI guess I\u2019m worried about a steady stream of potential employers saying I\u2019m way too overqualified for the position.\u201d\n\nBut Reddit users say the concern is often overblown. A retired chief information officer who now works at a hardware store said during his interview, the owner joked about his past salary and then hired him anyway. \"I just said I'm a retired CIO, looking for three days a week to learn something, have fun, contribute to a local business, and meet and help my neighbors.\"",

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com. Reserving the ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public. Listing on the Nasdaq is subject to approvals.\nDon\u2019t Miss Your Chance to Become an Early Investor in Pacaso:\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "More retirees are staying busy \u2014 but not everyone is working. Many retirees choose to stay connected to work, even if only part-time. Whether it's substitute teaching, freelancing, or picking up a fun side gig, plenty of retirees say they enjoy having a reason to get out of the house and some extra income to go with it.\nBut that's not the whole story. In fact, a large group of retirees have stepped away from paid work entirely \u2014 and say they have no intention of returning.\n\"I will never work again,\" one Reddit user wrote on the forum r/Retirement, launching a conversation that's gained momentum among those who identify as fully retired.

While some continue working by choice or necessity, a quiet but firm group is opting out completely.\nFor some, health plays a major role. One Redditor shared that a car accident 16 months into retirement left them unable to work \u2014 but also gave them clarity. Now, their days are focused on healing, enjoying time with their spouse, and planning small trips. \"That's good enough for me,\" they wrote.\nOthers say they've simply done their time. After decades of high-stress work, some retirees relish doing nothing at all \u2014 and don't feel the need to explain it.\n\"I'm the person everyone says you shouldn't be,\" one 71-year-old wrote. \"Don't \u2018do' much if anything \u2014 except what I like.\" That includes quiet mornings, staying up all night, and ignoring most scheduled social activities.\nTrending: Tired of Grid Failures and Charging Deserts? This Startup Has a Solar Fix and $25M+ in Sales \u2014 Now Raising at $3/Share\nRetirement, Without A Side Hustle, Can Still Be Rich With Meaning\nContrary to the idea that work gives life purpose, many retirees say they find joy and fulfillment in everyday routines. One described retirement as \"like being a kid again \u2014 except I have a car and money.\"\nAnother shared how retirement gave him the chance to return to who he once was: \"If my 16-year-old self showed up at the door to judge my life, I'd want him to feel like he finally got let off the leash.\"\nMany are keeping active in other ways \u2014 just not for pay.

Just 11% of future retirees say they plan to stop working entirely, according to the CNBC survey.\nFor those unsure if they'll be ready to fully retire, continuing to work can offer both financial and emotional benefits. Experts say even part-time income can stretch retirement savings and boost Social Security payouts.\nBut for those who can afford to stop working \u2014 and want to \u2014 the stories from fully retired Redditors offer an encouraging message: life after work doesn't have to be busy to be meaningful.\nRead Next: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg?

When they looked at other real estate investment platforms at the time, they found those companies would often brag to those investors about 4% annual returns on billions of dollars.\nAs Alex says on mogul\u2019s website, \u201cIf we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit immediately.\u201d\nTo date, properties in mogul\u2019s portfolio have generated an average 10-12% annual cash-on-cash yield that hit users\u2019 accounts as rent dividends each month. When long-term appreciation is included, historical performance rises to an 18.8% annualized returns, giving investors both regular income and capital growth\nPart of their success is due to the fact that mogul mogul approves fewer than one percent of properties reviewed. Each candidate asset must clear a 12% bear case hurdle rate before moving to the next level of diligence.\nYou can browse eligible properties on mogul\u2019s website and buy part or all of a house in under 30 seconds, or use the same data and tools available to top real estate firms to underwrite any property across the U.S.\nRent collections are aggregated and distributed to investors every month. At the same time, independent third-party valuations refresh inside your dashboard, letting you watch equity climb in real time while still enjoying depreciation and other pass-through tax advantages unique to real estate.\nMore than $1.2 million was invested on mogul last month.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Determine What Aspect of Your Financial Life You Need Help With\nIt's important to consider your current financial situation and what aspects of your financial life you might need help with. Consider whether you need financial guidance to set up long-term systems or help to reach specific goals.\nAre you planning for retirement and wonder whether you're saving enough? Are you dreaming of a second home and want to know if it's possible with your current income? Do you need help with insurance policies or debt repayment? In these cases and others, fiduciary financial advisors can help you align your financial actions to specific goals.\n2. Know the Different Types of Financial Advisors\nFamiliarize yourself with the various types of financial advisors. But before choosing to work with a professional, check your investment professional with the SEC to ensure they are in good standing.\n- Investment advisors: Those who provide investment advice or manage client assets directly.\n- Broker-dealers and brokers: Individuals or companies that buy and sell securities such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds on behalf of a client or themselves.\n- Certified financial planner\u00ae: Certified professionals who meet the requirements of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards and have a fiduciary responsibility.\n- Financial consultant: A general term; look for a chartered financial consultant or CHFC.\n- Financial coach: This is not a regulated term. Financial coaches may focus on basic financial planning points, such as how to save money or reduce spending.\n- Portfolio, investment and asset managers: These professionals manage clients' assets or portfolios.\n- Wealth advisors: Work with wealthy clients to offer holistic financial planning and investment guidance.\n- Robo-advisor: Inexpensive automated investment management services, usually available as a low-cost subscription or a small percentage of assets under management.\n3. Choose What Type of Financial Service You Need\nYou can choose from various financial planning services, including investment advice, budgeting, retirement planning, tax planning, estate planning and more. Financial advisors can offer diverse services to meet specific needs or holistic services.\n4. Determine the Cost and Fees of Financial Advisors\nThe cost of hiring financial advisors can vary based on the fee structure. They may charge a flat monthly fee, a percentage of assets under management (AUM) or another fee structure.\n5. Research and Compare Financial Advisors\nResearch and compare the credentials and qualifications of several financial advisors before hiring one. Look for a financial advisor with a fiduciary responsibility to ensure they have your best interests in mind. Read financial advisor ratings to learn from other customers\u2019 experiences.\n6. Important Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor\nBe sure to speak with the financial advisor and take advantage of a free initial consultation to understand if the financial advisor is a good fit. When selecting a financial advisor, you will want to ask them about:\n- Whether they are a fiduciary and have fiduciary responsibility?\n- What is their fee structure?\n- What are their average returns in the case of investment management?\n- How do they get paid?\n- What are the all-in costs?\n- What are their qualifications or certifications?\n- How will the relationship work?\n- What is the financial advisor's investment philosophy?\n- What custodian do they use?\n- What resources will you have?\n- What asset allocation do they use?\n- In the case of investments, what investment benchmarks are used?\nBest Financial Advisors Alternatives\nIf you decide that working with a financial advisor is not right, consider one of these alternatives.\n- Robo-advisors: When you open a robo-advisor account, you can access an algorithm that makes financial decisions without human intervention. The algorithm works on input information, such as goals and risk tolerance. While the fees on these accounts are minimal, they also don\u2019t earn as high as human-led accounts in most cases. But if you\u2019re cost-sensitive and don\u2019t know how to select your investments, a robo-advisor might be right.\n- DIY investing platforms: You don\u2019t need a financial advisor to get started investing. You can choose your investments and be your portfolio manager. Individuals who know their way around investments should consider using a DIY program because you won\u2019t have to give up any of your earnings to pay an advisor or a robo-advisor program. However, you do need to have the time to devote to managing your account.\n- Fee-only financial planners: You don\u2019t have to share your investment proceeds with a fee-only financial planner. Instead, you\u2019ll pay a flat fee or a percentage of the assets under management to your fee-only financial planner. This can benefit individuals with a great deal of assets to invest, which could mean thousands of dollars in earnings each year.\nSetting Up Your Financial Future\nFinancial advisors can offer valuable insight and strategies to optimize tax savings, set up long-term investment accounts and plan for short- and long-term goals. You can help protect your family's future and retirement with the right advice. Review the top financial advisors by performance to find a good fit based on your needs. All the options above offer personalized solutions at various price points to take you from where you are to your next goals. Take the first step toward financial security and schedule a consultation with one of these trusted advisors today.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho are the top rated financial advisors?\nAside from the list above, the best financial advisor companies include The Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments. Look to your community for leaders in your area or select SmartAsset, Money Pickle or Datalign as an online financial advisor.\nIs it worth paying for a financial advisor?\nWhether paying for a financial advisor depends on your financial skill set, understanding of investments, and time you can devote to the process.

It\u2019s often based on a percentage of the funds they oversee, ranging from 0.25% to 1% of assets under management annually.\nWhat credentials should I look for in a financial advisor?\nYour financial advisor should have a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) or CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation, which shows they\u2019ve completed the necessary professional training to provide financial advice.\nAre there any hidden costs associated with working with a financial advisor?\nWorking with a financial advisor can involve fees. These include annual fees charged by the mutual funds or other investments your advisor recommends.

      "text": "In the world of FIRE\u2014that's short for financial independence, retire early\u2014there's a lot of talk about hitting the $1 million mark. Some aim for more, especially with inflation, rising home costs, and uncertain market returns. But one Reddit user posed a simple question that cut through the big goals and got people thinking smaller:\n\"What is the smallest amount of money that would be life changing?\"\nThey followed it up with a scenario many can relate to:\n\"If you were gifted x amount, how would it change your life? To get you closer to a FIRE lifestyle. For example, I often think, if I \u2018just had an extra $300k' I could pay off my house and change to part time work.\"\nDon't Miss:\n- Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\n- Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion\u2014now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential. Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share.\nThat number\u2014$300,000\u2014struck a chord. It wasn't just a wild estimate. It was practical, down-to-earth, and repeated over and over.\nOne user wrote:\n\"$300k would be the number for life changing for me and my family.\"\nThey explained exactly why: \"That would mean the last little bit of school debt goes away, selling our current home and moving out of town a ways to a property with at least an acre of land. It means college savings for kids, a little bit of padding to retirement, and two newer used vehicles that aren't 10+ years old.\"\nThey added, \"I could do all that, probably with a few bucks left over.\"\nAnother put it bluntly:\n\"I don't need millions, just $300k.\"\nTrending: Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\nOthers went slightly higher. One user said, \"$300-400k is probably what it would take for me to seriously reconsider any of my current plans.\"\nOne response pegged the minimum closer to $400,000. \"Anything less would be great but not life changing.\" That amount, they said, would allow both partners in the household to semi-retire permanently.\nThere were some who shot higher. One said they'd need at least $1 million post-tax to feel a real shift in their life. Someone else responded that $500,000 would still mean five more years of work, and only $1 million would bring their timeline closer to two.\nA few were stuck in a limbo of liquid assets and fear. One user said they had $120,000 nearly liquid but were still too scared to buy a home. Another said, \"$60,000 would be enough for me to make a down payment on a house, which feels like the next big step in life.\" But they also admitted, \"I have 100k saved in the stock market, and I'm just so attached to it at this point.\"\nSee Also: Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market. Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential.\nThe answers were scattered across the map\u2014from $100 for a babysitter and a nice dinner out to $3 million for a stress-free early retirement with part-time work on the side. But $300,000 kept coming up. Not as a dream number, but as a number that felt real enough to change everything\u2014without making anyone rich.\nAs one person summed it up:\n\"10k would just be debt. $100 would be a babysitter and a nice dinner out for my wife and I.\"\nSo maybe the real benchmark for FIRE isn't just hitting a fat portfolio number. Maybe it's about figuring out what would let you breathe, slow down, or finally move out of a rental and onto your own land.\nAnd for a surprising number of people chasing early retirement, that number isn't seven figures\u2014it's $300,000.\nRead Next: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs.
