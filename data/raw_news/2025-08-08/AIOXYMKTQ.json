  "title": "I Tried 5 Free Apps to Learn Spanish \u2014 Here\u2019s the One I Actually Use Every Day",
  "description": "It just takes a few minutes a day.",
  "content": "This article may contain affiliate links that Yahoo and/or the publisher may receive a commission from if you buy a product or service through those links.\n\nAfter taking two years of Spanish in high school, I\u2019ve often regretted not delving further into the language. Sure, I\u2019ve been able to ask for directions and order specialty coffees while traveling in Mexico and Spain, but every time I travel to a Spanish-speaking country, I wish I knew more. But learning a language seemed like such a lofty task \u2014 until I added the best app to learn Spanish to my phone.\n\nWith a smartphone in hand, you can download free apps to sharpen your skills and learn how to converse in another language in just a few minutes a day. Over four days, I put several language apps to the test. Most of my recommendations also have paid versions, but if you don\u2019t want to spend a dime, here\u2019s what I liked (and didn\u2019t like) about the five best free language learning apps. I\u2019ve ranked them all, with my pick for the best app to learn Spanish in first place.\n\nBack in 2017, I tried Duolingo and quickly deleted it \u2014 the daily reminders made me feel guilty. However, after giving it a second chance, I love it. (I nixed the daily reminders this time around.)\n\u2022 None It includes over 40 languages, such as Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi, Latin, and Russian.\n\u2022 None Duolingo teaches languages through reading, listening, and speaking in the target language.\n\u2022 None Daily reminders are helpful for consistency\u2019s sake, but you can turn them off if you find them annoying.\n\u2022 None Duolingo takes a fun, gamelike approach, so you\u2019re learning without feeling like you\u2019re back in grade school.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun and interactive way to learn with a well-rounded approach. For example, cute characters like a bear wearing a blue scarf or a man in \u201980s-style workout gear clap and dance when you answer correctly, making it a visually pleasing way to practice. You earn points for correct answers, lesson completion, and consistent practice. The points don\u2019t turn into physical rewards, but they are extra motivation to tap in every day. I was able to learn quickly and retain words and phrases easily.\n\nPros: Rewards keep you motivated, and they also give you access to paid-only features. You get opportunities to review missed lessons to help correct wrong answers. There\u2019s also an end-of-year review that recaps all your progress.\n\n\n\nCons: The speaking section isn\u2019t spot-on. For example, the first time I was asked to speak, I said, \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m doing,\u201d which the app then oddly counted as the correct pronunciation of the Spanish phrase I was asked to repeat. But the app seemed to be more accurate from then on.\n\nThere is a 100% chance that I\u2019ll keep using this app. I believe it\u2019s one of the best free language-learning apps out there. In fact, I personally found it to be the best app to learn Spanish.\n\nWhat impressed me when I registered for Drops was that it asked me questions, such as my age and interests, so that it could tailor content to words I\u2019d likely use. My lessons featured pets and travel, both of which I listed as interests.\n\u2022 None If you\u2019re interested in reading and writing, the app also highlights proper spelling by encouraging users to drag and drop parts of words to form the whole.\n\u2022 None Serious learners can purchase a lifetime plan for $159.99 to learn multiple languages or become an expert in a single language.\n\u2022 None It features bite-size lessons with spaced learning, meaning that words learned early on will periodically reappear for reinforcement.\n\nThe lessons focus on memorizing words through reinforcement, which is perfect for beginners like me. I found the colors and drag-and-drop word associations to be helpful to solidify meanings in my mind.\n\n\n\nPros: My word retention was high due to the multiple ways they were presented, such as completing word chains and placing word parts in their correct order. I also found this app to be one of the least frustrating \u2014 it introduces words, instead of phrases, to beginners.\n\n\n\nCons: If you want to learn a language quickly, know that the free version of this app only lets you practice for five minutes a day. You can upgrade for $69.99 per year (or $12.99 a month) if you\u2019d like to use Drops for an extended period.\n\nI loved Drops, so I\u2019m pressing forward with my complementary lessons without upgrading to the free version. Five minutes a day is just enough to keep me consistent.\n\nIf you\u2019re constantly bumping up against your phone\u2019s storage limit like I am, you can still use your smartphone to learn via Readlang, which is a website that teaches language by translating content written in your native language to the language you are trying to learn.\n\nChoose fiction or nonfiction stories, songs, YouTube videos, or inspirational talks as you listen to and read the words in your selected language. Any terms that you choose to translate are automatically added to a list and put on a flash card for further practice. Not only is the premise creative, but it\u2019s easy to reinforce what you\u2019ve learned.\n\u2022 None You can import books, articles, and more to read pieces in the language you\u2019re trying to learn.\n\u2022 None Users can easily translate web pages to test their skills.\n\u2022 None The app also includes a mode for speaking and a video player for those who prefer audio-related learning.\n\nAs a beginner, I waded through the practice part of Readlang, which focuses on words and short phrases, providing detailed descriptions of how to use each word and what it exactly means.\n\n\n\nPros: A variety of works are available within each genre, meaning you can choose topics that interest you.\n\n\n\nCons: I feel this is more suitable for advanced learners or those who can easily absorb information by listening to many words rather than completing drills and learning just a few words at a time. The free version comes with unlimited text uploads and word translations, though some of the features are locked behind the premium version.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a beginner, I will put Readlang aside for now, but I may revisit it later. I really love the concept of this app, but it\u2019s way too advanced for me for now. However, if you already know a bit of the language, this could be the best app to learn Spanish for mid-level speakers and beyond.\n\nIf learning through videos and real-life scenarios is helpful for you, then Memrise is worth considering. Featuring filmed conversations, entertaining (and sometimes corny) situational videos, and word identification exercises, this app is a hands-on way to immerse yourself in a language and prepare for travel.\n\u2022 None Memrise currently has 23 languages, including Spanish, Danish, Korean, Mongolian, Portuguese, and Swedish.\n\u2022 None If you\u2019re already familiar with particular words and phrases, you can indicate that you know certain vocabulary and move on quickly.\n\u2022 None Instead of a bot, Memrise has real people speaking words, so you can practice proper pronunciation and inflection.\n\u2022 None The app features flash card-style learning, paired with videos and audio examples to cater to diverse learning styles.\n\nMemrise has users practice recalling words presented in the video until they can get a word or phrase correct, which I initially found frustrating but eventually appreciated, as it ultimately helped me retain the information.\n\n\n\nPros: Different actors appear in the videos, making the nuances of language, such as cadence and pitch, helpful for really solidifying memorization in realistic circumstances.\n\n\n\nCons: There are several prompts to upgrade to the pro version, which was distracting and caused me to lose focus between lessons.\n\nI didn\u2019t keep Memrise because the videos didn\u2019t help me learn as much as other app styles, but they could be right for you. I also think it could be better for non-beginners who are looking to form sentences and have conversations, or those who really like using flash cards to build their vocabulary.\n\nBusuu features videos with real people speaking words and phrases to help prepare users for hearing various vocal inflections. This app is part language learning and part social networking, and the community feature connects you with native speakers to help hone your accent or get feedback.\n\u2022 None The app uses AI to help personalize lessons according to your pace and performance.\n\u2022 None Busuu\u2019s global community helps users interact with native speakers, who will also offer feedback on speaking and writing.\n\u2022 None If you\u2019re on the go or without WiFi, you can use the app offline or download lessons to use when off the grid.\n\nEach lesson is just a few minutes long and focuses on perfecting a phrase by listening, reading, and speaking it. I only used the free trial (which lasts 30 days), which was enough for my purposes, and I didn\u2019t explore upgrading.\n\n\n\nPros: The videos are short and sweet, and phrases are presented in memorizable chunks to not overwhelm new learners.\n\n\n\nCons: The free version is annoying, since you have to watch an ad (usually a gaming video) to progress through the lessons, which wastes time that could be spent learning.\n\nUnfortunately, I promptly deleted Busuu, although I feel guilty because I did connect to the community, which can enhance the experience. For me, the best app to learn Spanish just doesn\u2019t need a social networking aspect \u2014 I want something I can consistently spend a handful of minutes of time on each day.\n\nNote: I tested but ultimately didn\u2019t recommend free versions of apps that required upgrading after a short trial. I also tried HelloTalk, which is free and has paid ad-free versions, but I found the networking intimidating, especially as I was inundated with hello \u201cwaves\u201d from others (mostly members of the opposite sex) immediately upon joining. However, users rave about the personal connection aspect.\n\nWe Used Our New \u201cRoom Plan\u201d Tool to Give This Living Room 3 Distinct Styles \u2014 See How, Then Try It Yourself\n\nThe Design Changemakers to Know in 2025\n\nCreate Your Own 3D Room Plan with Our New Tool\n\nSign up for Apartment Therapy's Daily email newsletter to receive our favorite posts, tours, products, and shopping guides in your inbox.",
