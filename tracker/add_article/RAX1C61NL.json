      "summary": "Hurricane Erin has caused significant coastal impacts along the East Coast, particularly in North Carolina's Outer Banks, where strong winds and waves have led to flooding and beach closures. The storm, categorized as a Category 2 hurricane, is noted for its large size, stretching over 500 miles, and is expected to bring dangerous rip currents and potential flooding through the weekend. While some areas have experienced damage, many communities have avoided widespread destruction, and the storm is forecasted to weaken as it moves further out to sea.",
