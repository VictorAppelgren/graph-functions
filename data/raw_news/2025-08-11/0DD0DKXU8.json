  "description": "Look what you made her do",
  "content": "A special limited vinyl edition of the album will be released in \u201cportofino orange glitter,\" according to a pre-order page on her site.\n\nSensing a pattern, eagle-eyed fans noticed that 12 minutes earlier, the popular \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast posted a tease for Wednesday. The show, hosted by Swift's boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce alongside his brother, former Eagles center Jason Kelce, posted an orange image on social media with a mysterious silhouette, many believing to be Swift.\n\nSwift also announced early Tuesday that she would appear on the podcast.\n\n\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d follows last year\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d announced during the 2024 Grammys and released during her record-breaking tour, which raked in over $2.2 billion across two years and five continents, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time.\n\nThe album is also her first release since Swift regained control over her entire body of work. In May, that pop star said she purchased her catalog of recordings \u2014 originally released through Big Machine Records \u2014 from their most recent owner, the private equity firm Shamrock Capital. She did not disclose the amount.\n\nIn recent years, Swift has been rerecording and releasing her first six albums in an attempt to regain control of her music. The project was instigated by Hybe America CEO Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift\u2019s effort to control her own songs and how they\u2019re used. Previous \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d releases have been more than conventional re-recordings, arriving with new \u201cfrom the vault\u201d music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work.\n\nSo far, there have been four rerecorded albums, beginning with \u201cFearless (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cRed (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d in 2021. All four have been massive commercial and cultural successes, each one debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nSwift\u2019s last rerecording, \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

(AP) \u2014 Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his brother, former Eagles center Jason Kelce, are taking their popular \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast to Amazon\u2019s Wondery under a three-year deal that gives the company exclusive advertising sales and distribution rights.\nThe financial terms of the deal were not immediately available, though some reports put the total at nine figures.\nThe deal, announced by Wondery on Tuesday, will begin with this week\u2019s episode, which drops Wednesday. It includes the back catalog of podcast content along with exclusive rights to monetize and distribute audio and video episodes.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to team up with Wondery for the next phase of \u2018New Heights,\u2019\u201d the Kelce brothers said in a statement. \u201cWe love this show and the fanbase that has grown with us over the last two seasons. Wondery understands the shared vision and will offer a wealth of experience and resources to take us to \u2018New Heights!\u2019\u201d\nThe personable Kelce brothers launched their podcast two years ago. It initially was designed to peel back the cover on the world of professional football players, but has since expanded to touch other corners of the pop culture universe.\nThe weekly series was chosen podcast of the year at the 2024 iHeartPodcast Awards.\n\u201c\u2018New Heights\u2019 on the surface is a sports podcast, and sports is such a well-listened-to category,\u201d Wondery chief executive Jen Sargent said, \u201cbut it\u2019s become a cultural phenomenon. They\u2019re in that cultural zeitgeist.\u201d\nTravis Kelce\u2019s celebrity status reached another level early last season, when the tight end of the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs began dating pop superstar Taylor Swift. He has several crossover projects in the works, including a 20-episode game show for Amazon Prime Video called \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Celebrity?\u201d\nJason Kelce recently retired after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles. But his popularity also has been on the rise; he was frequently seen attending the Paris Olympics and will appear on \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d on ESPN.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

This year it will be old \u2014 the pop star has announced she\u2019s dropping the first of her re-recorded albums.\nSwift said online Thursday that \u201cFearless: Taylor\u2019s Version\u201d is finished and \u201cwill be with you soon,\u201d featuring re-recorded songs from Swift\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cFearless.\u201d\nThe new set will have 26 songs \u2014 the original album had 13 \u2014 and also contain six never-before released songs, tunes which \u201calmost made\u201d the album. She said listeners will get a chance to hear the collection in all its \u201cwhimsical, effervescent, chaotic entirety.\u201d\nSwift will also release a new version of her song \u201cLove Story\u201d from \u201cFearless\u201d on Thursday at midnight, just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day weekend.\nSwift has vowed to re-record her first six albums after music manager Scooter Braun announced that his Ithaca Holdings company had acquired Big Machine Label Group, the home to Swift\u2019s first six albums. He then sold Swift\u2019s catalogue without the singer-songwriter being given a chance to acquire her masters.\n\u201cFearless\u201d was written when Swift was between 16-18 and earned Swift her first Grammy Award. The re-recorded version is likely to be embraced by her fans and push the original recordings lower in searches.\nSwift hasn\u2019t announced when \u201cFearless: Taylor\u2019s Version\u201d will be available but a statement she posted on Twitter included a hidden message using only the capital letters which reads: April Ninth.\nAbout the stuffed new recording, Swift wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve decided I want you to have the whole story, see the entire vivid picture, and let you into the entire dreamscape\u201d that is the \u201cFearless\u201d album.\n\u201cThis process has been more fulfilling and emotional than I could\u2019ve imagined and has made me even more determined to re-record all my music,\u201d she added.\nIn 2020, Taylor dropped two albums \u2014 \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cEvermore.\u201d\n___\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"

(AP) \u2014 You could say that Taylor Swift\u2019s championship era has reached its second consecutive season.\nThe 14-time Grammy Award-winning superstar returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Buffalo Bills 32-29 for a spot in their third consecutive Super Bowl.\nAs confetti rained down on the field afterward, Swift and Kelce kissed in celebration. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she continued the party with Kelce\u2019s mother, Donna, and some 80,000 fans who simply refused to leave their seats.\n\u201cI\u2019m very thankful that I\u2019m here in Kansas City, playing with the guys and everybody in this building,\u201d said Kelce, who had just two catches for 19 yards as the Bills refused to let him beat them single-handedly. \u201cIt\u2019s a special, special place. We feel that every single day and we just try to take advantage of it and not let it slip out of our hands.\u201d\nSwift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the playoffs last season, with Swift celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.\nThen came the Super Bowl, and Swift\u2019s much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.\nShe made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce\u2019s mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.\nThe couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium that night.\nOn Sunday, Swift walked toward her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff against Buffalo. And while she was decked out in Chanel for their divisional-round win over Houston, Swift opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.\nModest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.\nSwift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to end the Bills\u2019 season for the fourth time in the last five years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than to be playing at Arrowhead for an AFC championship,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThey had that thing rocking more than ever, and we needed them more than ever. That Buffalo team was as good as we\u2019ve ever played. A lot of great competitors over there. Got a lot of respect for those guys. They made it hard.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"

The magazine projects the Eras Tour will once again reach $1 billion within their eligibility window, meaning Swift is likely to bring in over $2 billion over the span of the tour.\nWorldwide, Swift\u2019s tour was followed by Beyonc\u00e9 in second, Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band in third, Coldplay in fourth, Harry Styles in fifth, and Morgan Wallen, Ed Sheeran, Pink, The Weeknd and Drake.\nIn North America, there was a similar top 10: Swift, followed by Beyonc\u00e9, Morgan Wallen, Drake, P!nk, Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Ed Sheeran, George Strait, Karol G, and RBD.\nBeyond the Swift of it all, 2023 was a landmark year for concert sales: worldwide, the top 100 tours of the year saw a 46% jump from last year, bringing in $9.17 billion compared to 2022\u2019s $6.28 billion.\nIn North America, that number jumped from $4.77 billion last year to $6.63 billion.\nEarlier this week, Swift was named Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year. Last month, Apple Music named her its artist of the year; Spotify revealed she was 2023\u2019s most-streamed artist globally, raking in more than 26.1 billion streams since Jan. 1 and beating Bad Bunny\u2019s three-year record.\nConsider 2023 a year of incredible pop music dominance \u2014 (Taylor\u2019s Version.)"

      "text": "Score one for red, the color, thanks to Taylor, Travis and the red vs. red Super Bowl\nScore one for red, the color, thanks to Taylor, Travis and the red vs. red Super Bowl\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Ever-present on the lips of Taylor Swift and the uniforms of both Super Bowl teams. In streetwear and along the Gucci runway. Amid the sea of Valentine\u2019s Day goods and in bright, dopamine home decor.\nThe color red has gone boom as loud as TNT.\nNot that TNT. We\u2019re talking TNT as in Taylor and Trav. The phenom that is Taylor Swift at boyfriend Travis Kelce\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs games was a red-hued wonder of a lead-up to Super Bowl LVIII. Media feast barely covers it.\nThe Chiefs and their opponents, the San Francisco 49ers, sport red during the regular season, just as they did ahead of their 2020 Super Bowl matchup. But this time around, it\u2019s the Tay factor that\u2019s been a score for classic red and other hues in its family.\nPower, passion, seduction. Luxurious and royal. Red is one of those colors that\u2019s both aspirational and proletarian at the same time. It can also symbolize anger or danger.\nIt\u2019s a color Kelce\u2019s paramour is intimately familiar with. We\u2019ve got Swift\u2019s albums \u201cRed\u201d and \u201cRed (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d of course, and her weekslong game-day Chiefs gear, and we\u2019ve always had her signature and remarkably immovable red lip color. Which lip brands she wears she usually keeps to herself, but we\u2019re looking at you Pat McGrath Labs.\nFOOTBALL AS A PLATFORM FOR RED\nThat aside, color experts consider football a perfect place for red.\n\u201cRed in sport, no surprise. It\u2019s speed, it\u2019s energy, it\u2019s confidence building, it\u2019s power. So who wouldn\u2019t want that, especially if you\u2019re playing in the Super Bowl?\u201d said Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, a consulting service that keeps a sharp eye on trends.\nBut red is so much more, and has been since the dawn of red-blooded humankind and their big brains.\nRed in sport, no surprise. It\u2019s speed, it\u2019s energy, it\u2019s confidence building, it\u2019s power. So who wouldn\u2019t want that, especially if you\u2019re playing in the Super Bowl?\nBecause of its sharpness, our eyes pick up on red more quickly than they do other colors, said Stuart Semple, a British artist who creates and sells his own line of affordable paint. \u201cWe\u2019re hardwired to look out for danger in our environment. At the moment, we\u2019re seeing red just about everywhere.\u201d\nRED ON THE RISE IN FASHION AND BEAUTY\nKlarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later service, clocked a 254% increase in September over the same month the year before in red lipstick purchases. Red heels enjoyed an 86% boost in the same period, along with red blouses (a 161% rise) and red dresses (a 71% hike), said Erin Jaeger, head of the company for North America.\n\u201cRed has always been an `it\u2019 color and a classic statement look, but it\u2019s had a resurgence on runways and in mainstream culture over the past few months. What really makes red a go-to color is its versatility. You can wear red accessories to add color to a more neutral look or throw on a red lip or red nail polish. Right now, people are turning to red as a winter statement color, worn both casually or in a more dressed-up look,\u201d she said.\nTHE RED VS. RED SUPER BOWL\nThe 49ers have some skin in the red fashion game, too, in running back Christian McCaffrey\u2019s fiancee, Olivia Culpo, and in Kristin Juszczyk, fullback Justin Juszczyk\u2019s wife.\nKristin, a designer, landed an NFL licensing deal to use league logos on apparel after creating a custom Chiefs puffer for Swift.\n\u201cAhead of the red vs. red Super Bowl matchup, my eyes are going to be on the fashion we see from the players\u2019 walk-in looks, fans and WAGs,\u201d Jaeger said, using sports speak for wives and girlfriends. \u201cI\u2019m expecting some really fun red-centric looks with hints of black and white.\u201d\nRED ON FASHION WEEK RUNWAYS\nRed made a splash on Paris runways, and Vogue declared it the color of 2023 in street style. In Milan, Gucci\u2019s new creative director, Sabato De Sarno, debuted his vision for the house in September, introducing Gucci Rosso, a rich shade of oxblood that teeters on burgundy.\nAnother of red\u2019s attributes is that some people have convinced themselves they can\u2019t wear it.\n\u201cHistorically, a lot of people have stayed away from red, particularly redheads and others who feel like it\u2019s not their color. I truly think anyone can wear it. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right hue for you,\u201d Jaeger said.\nBianca Betancourt, the digital culture editor at Harper\u2019s Bazaar, sees a lot less divisiveness over red these days.\n\u201cRed has always been credited as a power color and not meant for the sartorially shy, which is why seeing it as a leading trend is so fascinating. The answer to what women want to wear right now is clear: They simply just want to be seen. Wearing red accomplishes that,\u201d she said.\nRED THROUGHOUT HISTORY\nThe color is among the oldest natural pigments. Red ochre, an iron oxide, dates to prehistoric times and drawings on cave walls. Red has been used to adorn the body in many cultures, including the ancient Egyptians, Mayans, Roman generals and during the Renaissance. It is the symbolic color of communism and socialism. In China, India and other Asian countries, red expresses happiness and good fortune.\nSemple, who went to war with fellow artist Anish Kapoor over the latter\u2019s exclusive rights to the world\u2019s blackest of blacks, made his first red when he was 17. It\u2019s called Raygun.\nA bull becomes furious only if he is presented with a red cloth; a philosopher, on the other hand, goes into a rage as soon as the color is mentioned.\n\u201cI made it in my garden shed with a bag of cadmium red and some linseed oil. It\u2019s probably really toxic. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. It still uses cadmium to this day, which is why it carries such a strong warning when artists use it. But honestly, I can\u2019t find a better pigment,\u201d he said.\nGeothe, the great German writer, had his own take on red, according to Michel Pastoureau\u2019s book \u201cRed: The History of a Color.\u201d\n\u201cA bull becomes furious only if he is presented with a red cloth; a philosopher, on the other hand, goes into a rage as soon as the color is mentioned.\u201d"

      "text": "Music Review: Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018The Tortured Poets Department\u2019 is great sad pop, meditative theater\nMusic Review: Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018The Tortured Poets Department\u2019 is great sad pop, meditative theater\nWho knew what Taylor Swift\u2019s latest era would bring? Or even what it would sound like? Would it build off the moodiness of \u201cMidnights\u201d or the folk of \u201cevermore\u201d? The country or the \u201880s pop of her latest re-records? Or its two predecessors in black-and-white covers: the revenge-pop of \u201cReputation\u201d and the literary Americana of \u201cfolklore\u201d?\n\u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d here Friday, is an amalgamation of all of the above, reflecting the artist who \u2014 at the peak of her powers \u2014 has spent the last few years re-recording her life\u2019s work and touring its material, filtered through synth-pop anthems, breakup ballads, provocative and matured considerations.\nIn moments, her 11th album feels like a bloodletting: A cathartic purge after a major heartbreak delivered through an ascendant vocal run, an elegiac verse, or mobile, synthesized productions that underscore the powers of Swift\u2019s storytelling.\nAnd there are surprises. The lead single and opener \u201cFortnight\u201d is \u201c1989\u201d grown up \u2014 and features Post Malone. It might seem like a funny pairing, but it\u2019s a long time coming: Since at least 2018, Swift\u2019s fans have known of her love for Malone\u2019s \u201cBetter Now.\u201d\nTaylor Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d is here.\n- In her review, AP Music Writer Maria Sherman calls it \u201can amalgamation of an artist who has spent the last few years re-recording her life\u2019s work and touring its material, filtered through synth-pop anthems, breakup ballads, provocative and matured subject matter.\u201d\n- Swift announced a surprise two hours after the album release: 15 additional tracks.\n- The project is Swift\u2019s first original album since her record-breaking Eras Tour kicked off last year.\n\u201cBut Daddy I Love Him\u201d is the return of country Taylor, in some ways \u2014 fairytale songwriting, a full band chorus, a plucky acoustic guitar riff, and a cheeky lyrical reversal: \u201cBut Daddy I love him / I\u2019m having his baby / No, I\u2019m not / But you should see your faces.\u201d (Babies appear on \u201cFlorida!!!\u201d and the bonus track \u201cThe Manuscript\u201d as well.)\nThe fictitious \u201cFresh Out The Slammer\u201d begins with a really pretty psych guitar tone that disappears beneath wind-blown production; the new wave-adjacent \u201cMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\u201d brings back \u201cBarbie\u201d: \u201cI felt more when we played pretend than with all the Kens / \u2018Cause he took me out of my box.\u201d\nEven before Florence Welch kicks off her verse in \u201cFlorida!!!,\u201d the chorus\u2019 explosive repetition of the song title hits hard with nostalgic 2010s indie rock, perhaps an alt-universe Swiftian take on Sufjan Stevens\u2019 \u201cIllinois.\u201d\nAs another title states, \u201cSo Long, London,\u201d indeed.\nIt would be a disservice to read Swift\u2019s songs as purely diaristic, but that track \u2014 the fifth on this album, which her fans typically peg as the most devastating slot on each album \u2014 evokes striking parallels to her relationship with a certain English actor she split with in 2023. Place it next to a sleepy love ode like \u201cThe Alchemy,\u201d with its references to \u201ctouchdown\u201d and cutting someone \u201cfrom the team\u201d and well ... art imitates life.\nRevenge is still a pervasive theme. But where the reprisal anthems on \u201cMidnights\u201d were vindictive, on \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d there are new complexities: \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me?\u201d combines the musical ambitiousness of \u201cevermore\u201d and \u201cfolklore\u201d \u2014 and adds a resounding bass on the bridge \u2014 with sensibilities ripped from the weapons-drawn, obstinate \u201cReputation.\u201d But here, Swift mostly trades victimhood for self-assurance, warts and all.\n\u201cWho\u2019s afraid of little old me?\u201d she sings. \u201cYou should be,\u201d she responds.\nAnd yet, \u201cThe Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\u201d may be her most biting song to date: \u201cYou didn\u2019t measure up in any measure of a man,\u201d she sings atop propulsive piano. \u201cI\u2019ll forget you, but I won\u2019t ever forgive,\u201d she describes her target, likely the same \u201ctattooed golden retriever,\u201d a jejune description, mentioned in the title track.\nMissteps are few, found in other mawkish lyrics and songs like \u201cDown Bad\u201d and \u201cGuilty as Sin?\u201d that falter when placed next to the album\u2019s more meditative pop moments.\nElsewhere, Swift holds up a mirror to her melodrama and melancholy \u2014 she\u2019s crying at the gym, don\u2019t tell her about \u201csad,\u201d is she allowed to cry? She died inside, she thinks you might want her dead; she thinks she might just die. She listens to the voices that tell her \u201cLights, camera, bitch, smile / Even when you want to die,\u201d as she sings on \u201cI Can Do It with a Broken Heart,\u201d a song about her own performances \u2014 onstage and as a public figure.\n\u201cI\u2019m miserable and nobody even knows!\u201d she laughs at the end of the song before sighing, \u201cTry and come for my job.\u201d\n\u201cClara Bow\u201d enters the pantheon of great final tracks on a Swift album. The title refers to the 1920s silent film star who burned fast and bright \u2014 an early \u201cIt girl\u201d and Hollywood sex symbol subject to vitriolic gossip, a victim of easy, everyday misogyny amplified by celebrity. Once Bow\u2019s harsh Brooklyn accent was heard in the talkies, it was rumored, her career was over.\nIn life, Bow later attempted suicide and was sent to an asylum \u2014 the same institution that appears on \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me?\u201d \u201cClara Bow\u201d works as an allegory and a cautionary tale for Swift, the same way Stevie Nicks\u2019 \u201cMabel Normand\u201d \u2014 another tragic silent film star \u2014 functioned for the Fleetwood Mac star.\nNicks appears in \u201cClara Bow,\u201d too: \u201cYou look like Stevie Nicks in \u201975 / The hair and lips / Crowd goes wild.\u201d\nLater, Swift turns the camera inward, and the song ends with her singing, \u201cYou look like Taylor Swift in this light / We\u2019re loving it / You\u2019ve got edge / She never did.\u201d The album ends there, on what could be read as self-deprecation but stings more like frustrating self-awareness.\nSwift sings about a tortured poet, but she is one, too. And isn\u2019t it great that she\u2019s allowed herself the creative license?"

      "text": "From country to pop, 2014 nostalgia to 2023 reality \u2014 it\u2019s time for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u20181989'\nFrom country to pop, 2014 nostalgia to 2023 reality \u2014 it\u2019s time for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u20181989'\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Taylor Swift\u2019s reimagined \u201c1989\u201d is here, the album that ushered in the first Peak Swift era \u2014 revisited at the height of her massive pop culture dominance.\nReleased in 2014 and named for her birth year, the original \u201c1989\u201d signified a sonic rebirth. Swift had shed the Nashville country roots of her first four studio albums and announced herself a full-fledged pop superstar.\n\u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d out Friday, takes that version of Swift \u2014 then in her mid-20s, living in New York, prepared to take on the world with an arsenal of \u201980s synth sounds and a new producer named Jack Antonoff \u2014 and includes five unreleased \u201cvault\u201d tracks that deliver more clues about the artist she was then.\nPrevious \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d releases have been more than conventional rerecordings, arriving with new music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work. The project \u2014 the fourth of six rereleases \u2014 was instigated by music manager Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift\u2019s effort to control her own songs and how they\u2019re used.\nHer return to \u201c1989\u201d \u2014 the album where she began to confront media portrayals of herself and in song \u2014 comes at another Swift popularity crescendo but also during a 2010s nostalgia (Yes, it\u2019s only 2023. Yes, the nostalgia is real).\nHere are some key things to consider as \u201c1989\u201d propels the New Peak Swift era forward:\nOPENING THE VAULT\nListeners will dive deep into the vault tracks for clues into Swift\u2019s mind around 2014. \u201cSlut!\u201d may recall her contentious relationship with the press, which fixated on her alleged romantic relationships and the songs she\u2019d write once they ended.\nThey\u2019ll find connections to \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d on \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d in the lyrics \u201cwhen you lost control / red blood, white snow.\u201d They\u2019ll wonder who made her pretend to like acid rock and mega yachts on \u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk.\u201d But more insight will be found in thinking about where Swift was at the time, what came next, and how that mirrors the current moment.\nSwift dominated headlines and award show crowd shots in 2014, reaching a point of oversaturation, and leading to her retreat from the public eye prior to the release of her undercelebrated revenge record, 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d With Swift getting similar treatment on NFL broadcasts due to her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, could history repeat itself?\nBrittany Spanos, senior writer at Rolling Stone, puts it simply: \u201cPeople just get easily sick of anyone who\u2019s super famous. And I think that we haven\u2019t had a lot of monocultural kind of celeb moments like this in a minute,\u201d she says of Swift in 2023.\nRebecca Jennings, a senior correspondent at Vox covering social platforms and the creator economy, sees a connection between the 2014 eras as being \u201cpost-recession\u201d and 2023 being \u201cpost-COVID,\u201d a time where Swift succeeds because there\u2019s a sort of cultural \u201cbouncing back vibe,\u201d a time where people want celebratory music.\nIn 2014, that was Swift finding her pop sound with \u201c1989.\u201d\nIn 2023, it\u2019s becoming the most successful version of herself, and rereleasing \u201c1989 \u201d while on the top of her game.\nFROM COUNTRY TO POP: A TRANSITIONAL ALBUM\n\u201cIt was a huge risk for her to move completely outside of country \u2013 there\u2019s no country elements on this album whatsoever,\u201d says Spanos, who also teaches a course on Swift at New York University\u2019s Clive Davis Institute. She says Swift\u2019s penchant for pop songwriting is evidenced all the way back on her 2008 sophomore release \u201cFearless\u201d in tracks like \u201cLove Story,\u201d but \u201c1989\u201d is \u201cher first official, full-length pop project.\u201d\nHowever, more so than a declarative move into pop, Spanos views \u201c1989\u201d as \u201cmore in the lineage of the kind of transitional albums teen stars tend to make when they move into adulthood,\u201d comparing it to Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cControl\u201d and Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cStripped.\u201d \u201c1989\u201d is the album where Swift\u2019s divorced herself from adolescence. She\u2019s moved to NYC; she\u2019s working with new people; she\u2019s making synth pop.\nRachel Brodsky, a music and culture writer who has been covering Swift for well over a decade, points out that Swift\u2019s sonic experimentations were earned \u2014 and that she very well might be one of the final pop superstars who couldn\u2019t come out of the gate playing with genre the way listeners are accustomed to now.\n\u201cShe came up in the shadow of the Chicks, where she was told under certain circumstances by her team, like, \u2019You don\u2019t want to be the Chicks,\u201d Brodsky says of the country music group who were chastised for going against the expectations of their audience.\nThe Chicks, acts like Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes cracked open the door for Swift to burst open on \u201c1989,\u201d she says. And not just as a pop musician, but as someone bucking convention \u2014 something Brodsky says artists like Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris and even Olivia Rodrigo have followed.\nENGAGING WITH HER OWN CELEBRITY\nBy the time \u201c1989\u201d rolled around, Swift was no longer writing high school romances and fairytale narratives.\nShe\u2019d begun engaging with her celebrity reality \u2014 inviting Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z to her birthday party, hanging out with models and other very famous people in a group labeled \u201cthe Squad\u201d in the media.\nShe was also writing songs like \u201c\u2019Bad Blood,\u2019 which is about her feud with Katy Perry,\u201d says Spanos, a decisive move away from the kind of humility and \u201chometown girl\u201d image associated with \u201ccountry Taylor.\u201d That meant occupying more space in the pop landscape: reconciling with Kanye West after the infamous 2009 VMAs moment, starring alongside Drake in a commercial, getting Kendrick Lamar on a remix, so on and so forth.\nIn 2023, Swift is more famous now than she was then, and she\u2019s still engaging with her celebrity in a very public way.\n\u20181989 (TAYLOR\u2019S VERSION)\u2019 PLAYS INTO FONDNESS FOR 2014\nJennings believes people are nostalgic for the year 2014 and always will be \u2014 because it was one of the last online periods before the hyper-commodification of social media \u2014 which makes 2023 the ideal time for revisiting \u201c1989.\u201d\nThere were blogs, and Tumblr, and our internet lives were less defined by algorithms. \u201cIt is looked at as this Edenic time of innocence and purity,\u201d she says. At the time, there was a kind of monoculture that leans itself to nostalgia in 2023, she says \u2014 everyone receiving the same information on the same topics at the same time, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d era included \u2014 as opposed to the current influencer-based model.\n(It\u2019s worth noting that Swift herself was very active on Tumblr, using the social media platform to find fans to invite to private listening sessions held in her home.)\nAdditionally, in the last few months, Swift has been seen dining with very famous friends like Blake Lively, Sophie Turner and Selena Gomez, a return to the language of her \u201cSquad.\u201d \u201cBy parading out many of the same friends she had during that era that she was also parading about, she\u2019s playing into this nostalgia element,\u201d argues Jennings.\nAt the time, theories swirled around Swift\u2019s assumed romantic relationships \u2014 many believe the song \u201cStyle\u201d is about her short relationship with Harry Styles \u2014 and in 2023, her latest assumed romance has become a top story again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like she\u2019s method promoting,\u201d Spanos jokes. \u201cShe\u2019s leaning into it again.\u201d But there\u2019s a huge difference in the kind of treatment she\u2019s receiving from the public this time around. The press appears to be rooting for her relationship, she says, instead of thinking about the breakup songs it might inspire, warning her male partners and turning Swift into the butt of the joke \u2014 as the media was doing in 2014.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit less of that level of misogyny,\u201d Spanos says.\nSo what\u2019s next for Swift?\nThe continuation of her Eras tour, which is set to resume on November 9th in Buenos Aires, Argentina. And, of course, two more \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d albums."

Here\u2019s how to reconsider Taylor Swift\u2019s transformative album\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 In 2010, newly anointed as a Grammy winner, Taylor Swift released \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d her third studio album and her first without a single songwriting collaboration.\nHer 2006 self-titled debut and 2008\u2019s \u201cFearless\u201d had inspired both acclaim and criticism for her bold bridges and keen lyricism \u2014 these are masterful country-pop songs, critics argued, but surely a teen idol wasn\u2019t responsible for them. Swift proved her detractors wrong on \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d an album that arrived just before her pivot from country\u2019s youngest hope to pop\u2019s freshest voice.\nThe album served as a close document of her nascent fame and future career ambitions, and now, 13 years on, it\u2019s back. \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d released Friday, is the third release of the six albums Swift plans to re-record. The Taylor\u2019s Version albums, instigated by music manager Scooter Braun\u2019s sale of her early catalog, represent Swift\u2019s effort to control her own songs and how they\u2019re used \u2014 a fitting ethos for \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d a record built exclusively of her own voice.\nIn preparation for \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d The Associated Press reached out to Taylor Swift scholars to discuss all the ways listeners can and should think about the release.\nADOLESCENCE TO ADULTHOOD\nBefore \u201cSpeak Now\u201d became \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d the working title was \u201cEnchanted,\u201d named after the power ballad of the same name. The mythology ( folklore, anyone? ) behind the shift is that Swift\u2019s label president at the time, Big Machine Records CEO Scott Borchetta, told her to move on from whimsy and fairytale iconography \u2014 she was entering her 20s and this LP warranted a more mature title.\nTransition creates an interesting framework for thinking about this album: Written largely between the ages of 18 and 20, released when she turned 21, \u201cSpeak Now\u201d is a collection of songs on a precipice \u2014 of adulthood, of fame, of declaring ownership but still concerned with the subject matters that concern a young adult. There are crushes (\u201cSuperman,\u201d \u201cSparks Fly\u201d) and bittersweet breakups (\u201cBack to December,\u201d \u201cIf This Was a Movie\u201d), alike.\n\u201cYou hear a youngness when you listen to these songs,\u201d says musicologist Lily Hirsch, author of \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Grrrls: Confronting Sexist Labels in Music from Ariana Grande to Yoko Ono.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about these romantic relationships. The world hinges on all of that, which is so typical of that age. So, it is interesting hear the re-recordings bring a more mature voice to those earlier preoccupations.\u201d\nElizabeth Scala teaches a course on Taylor Swift\u2019s songbook at the University of Texas at Austin as an introduction to literary studies and research methods.\n\u201cI think \u2018Speak Now\u2019 is still in the vein of \u2018I don\u2019t have enough life experience at my ripe age of 18 to give you a fully autobiographical anything, but I\u2019m going to use what I read and what I know from other people,\u2019\u201d she says of the songs\u2019 lyrical content, which still manage to \u201cmake really beautiful, coherent things out of the messiness and inaccuracy of our memories.\u201d\nIN CONVERSATION WITH HER CRITICS AND CELEBRITY\nComing a year after Kanye West interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, \u201cSpeak Now\u201d is the moment in Swift\u2019s career where she began to use her celebrity as a mirror to her interior life.\n\u201cMean,\u201d a takedown of a rock critic, becomes a banjo-led treatise on antagonism of any kind; the blues-y \u201cDear John\u201d centers on a young woman\u2019s tumultuous relationship with an older man.\n\u201cInsults are everywhere in music, and men don\u2019t get the same flak for it,\u201d Hirsch says, in reference to \u201cDear John\u201d and \u201cMean.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that women especially are supposed to take the high road, turn the other cheek and all of that, and men can get away with the low road, and they certainly do in music. It\u2019s a kind of double standard. Women are labeled \u2018catty\u2019 when confronting bad behavior, like in \u2018Dear John.\u2019\u201d\nA common pastime among Swift fans is to unearth the identities of her songs\u2019 subjects. But, to Scala, \u201cthe most boring way to think about Taylor Swift is in terms of her biography.\u201d\nAt a recent stop of her Eras Tour in Minneapolis, Swift seemed to agree, playing \u201cDear John\u201d live for the first time in 11 years after delivering this introduction:\n\u201cI\u2019m 33 years old. I don\u2019t care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote and the memories we made together. So what I\u2019m trying to tell you is, I\u2019m not putting this album out so you should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I might have written a song about 14 billion years ago.\u201d\nScala sees a throughline between this album and its successors, with \u201cDear John\u201d as a precursor to \u201cAll Too Well\u201d and \u201cMean\u201d as prescient to \u201cBlank Space,\u201d a song that parodies how she\u2019s been portrayed in the media.\nREVISIONIST HISTORY\nMuch online chatter surrounding the re-recording of \u201cSpeak Now\u201d has centered on \u201cBetter Than Revenge,\u201d a pop-punk song that takes aim at another woman instead of the man that wronged them both. It takes both sonic and thematic cues from Paramore\u2019s 2007 pop-rock hit \u201cMisery Business,\u201d a similar song about the same subject. (In fact, on \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d Paramore singer Hayley Williams lends vocals to a \u201cvault\u201d song, \u201cCastles Crumbling.\u201d)\nIn the original chorus of \u201cBetter Than Revenge,\u201d Swift sings, \u201cShe\u2019s an actress / She\u2019s better known for the things she does on the mattress,\u201d a rare lyrical misstep in a career underscored by poetic turns of phrases (in the opener \u201cMine,\u201d she sings \u201cYou made a rebel of a careless man\u2019s careful daughter\u201d). In her 2023 \u201cBetter Than Revenge\u201d version, the lyric becomes \u201cHe was a moth to the flame / She was holding the matches.\u201d\n\u201cIf we think about 2010, slut-shaming rhetoric certainly existed in movies and shows. She\u2019s certainly not the only one who has done this at that time,\u201d Hirsch argues, quick to point out that Swift has also been the target of sexist vitriol.\nSwift\u2019s alteration of the song in her re-recording follows a lineage of other pop stars doing the same. Lizzo and Beyonc\u00e9 recently changed lyrics to songs deemed offensive. Weird Al no longer performs his Michael Jackson parodies. And because Swift hasn\u2019t performed \u201cBetter Than Revenge\u201d live for well over a decade, she hasn\u2019t needed to confront this particular song, in this particular way.\n\u201cWe are willing to replace the old version with Taylor\u2019s Versions because they are exact replicas, as much as they can be,\u201d Scala argues. \u201cIf she does something different, it becomes a different song.\u201d A different song, this time, owned by Swift.\nART EVOLVES WITH TIME\n\u201cFrom a literary historian\u2019s point of view, when you first hear \u2018Speak Now,\u2019 you could only look at her career up to that point: It meant something in her creative timeline,\u201d says Scala. \u201cAnd now we have the rest of her career to compare it to, so it\u2019s hard to listen to the record the same way. You can compare it to the older recording, but its deeper and richer.\u201d\nTechnology has changed from 2010. So has Swift: Her voice has matured, no longer possessing the sweet self-restraint that colored her earliest releases.\nEach release comes with a few \u201cFrom the Vault\u201d tracks, unreleased songs from each album\u2019s period reimagined for the current moment. They, too, give a fuller picture.\nAN EXERCISE IN ARTISTIC AUTONOMY\nBeyond all of the music and cultural considerations, the fact is: Taylor Swift is re-recording this album to own her work, like she is doing with so many of her records \u2014 but this is the only album in her discography that is entirely self-penned, the one celebrated for its dismissals of exploitative male characters and poetic embrace of girlhood.\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard not to think of \u201cCould\u2019ve, Would\u2019ve, Should\u2019ve\u201d from her 2022 LP, \u201cMidnights,\u201d where Swift sings \u201cGive me back my girlhood, it was mine first,\u201d as a self-reflection of her \u201cSpeak Now\u201d self. That track is a creative reclamation of the teen who wrote \u201cDear John\u201d as an adult; \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d is the literal reclamation.\n\u201cOwning these masters, she decided to take back that control,\u201d Hirsch says. \u201cI love what it communicates: that we all have power, we don\u2019t have to just sit back and take these situations, especially when it concerns our own voice.\u201d"

The pop star officially has more No. 1 albums than any woman in history.\n\u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d, released earlier this month, is the third in her endeavor to re-record her first six albums, instigated by music manager Scooter Braun\u2019s sale of her early catalog.

What we know and what\u2019s still speculation\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Scooter Braun is one of the most recognizable names in the music business for his singular work as an executive and entrepreneur. He\u2019s managed many of your favorite artists, propelling the likes of Justin Bieber to stratospheric fame, and earned the ire of Taylor Swift and her legions of fans for his business practices.\nOn Friday, rumors circulated online that Justin Bieber was leaving Braun, his longtime manager \u2014 and the man credited with discovering him. In the days that followed, speculation grew, and media outlets began reporting that some of Braun\u2019s other hype-profile clients like Ariana Grande, and Demi Lovato were also parting ways with him \u2014 all of which has yet to be confirmed.\nBraun hasn\u2019t issued a public statement, but did tweet in jest, writing \u201cBreaking news\u2026 I\u2019m no longer managing myself.\u201d\nAs the story continues to unfold, here\u2019s everything we know \u2014 and everything we don\u2019t \u2014 about what\u2019s going with Scooter Braun and his powerful client roster.\nWho has Scooter Braun managed?\nWithout confirmation from artists, their teams, or Braun himself, changes to Braun\u2019s roster are conjectural. AP reached out to every artist listed as being managed under Braun\u2019s company, SB Projects, on their official website and only heard back from a select few.\nA person familiar with SB Projects\u2019 business dealings, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told the AP the artists on the company\u2019s roster have day-to-day managers who are not Braun, and he consults with them. The person noted that no single person would be able to manage his roster of some of the biggest names in music on their own.\nThe site mentions his company\u2019s \u201cpast and present work\u201d and includes artists Braun no longer works with, including Hilary Duff and J Balvin.\nRepresentatives for Carly Rae Jepsen, BabyJake, and Asher Roth confirmed to AP that those artists no longer work with Braun and haven\u2019t for quite some time.\nA person close to Idina Menzel told AP the singer is no longer managed by Braun but was not authorized to speak publicly.\nA representative for pop star Ava Max confirmed that she is still represented by Braun.\nOK, but why is Scooter Braun a big deal?\nIn the early 2000s, Braun dropped out of Emory College to throw parties for elite musicians traveling to Atlanta: Ludacris, Eminem, even Britney Spears. Jermaine Dupri recruited him to become So So Def\u2019s executive director of marketing. Later, in 2007, Braun started his own talent management company, SB Projects, where in 2008, he\u2019d discover Justin Bieber on YouTube, growing the teen heartthrob\u2019s profile by utilizing social media.\nSB Projects encompasses a few ventures: Management, which included clients like Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, and for a short-stint, Kanye West; Sheba Publishing, a joint venture with Universal Music Group Publishing; and Schoolboy Records, a record label first put on the map by Braun\u2019s client Asher Roth and his 2009 hit \u201cI Love College.\u201d\nBraun operated his assorted companies under one entity called Ithaca Holdings.\nIn the midst of his incredible success, in 2019, Braun bought Big Machine Records, the label that originally signed Taylor Swift and released her first six records. Its CEO Scott Borchetta stayed in place. With the purchase, Braun purchased ownership to Swift\u2019s master recordings, which he sold to an investment fund the following year. As a result, Swift announced that she would re-record her albums to own her new masters in a project called \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version.\u201d\nIn April 2021, Braun sold Ithaca Holdings to HYBE \u2014 the publicly traded company formerly known as Big Hit Entertainment, best known for creating the K-pop group BTS \u2014 in a $1.05 billion deal. According to the corporate filling, Braun would receive about 462,380 shares of the company (totaling $86.2 million) while his star clients Grande and Bieber would each receive 53,557 shares, or almost $11.0 million apiece.\nIn January 2023, he became the sole CEO of HYBE America, having previously shared the title after the merger with Big Hit\u2019s Lenzo Yoon.\nBack up \u2014 what is Braun doing with HYBE?\nWhen Braun\u2019s Ithaca Holdings merged with the globally minded HYBE in April 2021, it became one of the largest music companies in the world. Just a few months later, in July, Bang Si-hyuk, the CEO of Bit Hit Entertainment/HYBE stepped down, Park Ji-won took over, and Lenzo Yoon and Scooter Braun were named co-CEOs of HYBE America. In January, Braun became the sole CEO \u2014 which means he\u2019s busy.\nThere has been speculation that if Braun\u2019s artists are leaving SB Projects management, it is because Braun is slowly placing his focus on HYBE America instead of acting as an artist manager. But so far, there\u2019s been no confirmation that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\nWhat does a music manager do?\nThe role of a music manager is an elusive one, based largely on the kind of relationship between the businessperson and the musician. The best music managers \u2014 and we\u2019re excluding business and tour managers here, whose specialties are in the title \u2014 are fiercely organized, dedicated to the success of their artist. They possess a deep understanding of the industry and the artist\u2019s place within it.\nThey work to ensure their artist\u2019s projects run smoothly, connecting teams to reach a particular goal. Think of them as the behind-the-scenes engine responsible for allowing the artist to succeed. Often, they invest in and help develop an artist, and tackle anything from creative production to day-to-day operations."
