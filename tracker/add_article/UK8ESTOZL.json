      "summary": "Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch declined to run for New York City mayor, describing herself as a public servant rather than a politician. At a breakfast event in Southampton, she praised the NYPD’s record, opposed President Trump’s National Guard deployment, and condemned anti‑Israel protests while affirming the department’s respect for free speech. Tisch highlighted record low violent crime and her past work as sanitation commissioner. The event drew supporters of former Governor Cuomo, Mayor Adams, and Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, reflecting the city’s political climate.",
