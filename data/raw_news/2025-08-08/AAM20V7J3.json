  "description": "Perfect binge-watching through the upcoming weekend.",
  "content": "There are some weekends when all you want to do is unwind and binge-watch an entertaining show. If you\u2019re looking for something new to stream over the next few days, here are five shows worth checking out on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nGood Omens is a fantasy comedy show that was created by Neil Gaiman, based on a 1990 novel by him and Terry Pratchett. It stars Michael Sheen as the angel Aziraphale and David Tennant as the demon Crowley. The story starts off with the birth of the Antichrist, which sets the stage for an imminent Armageddon in the near future.\n\nIt\u2019s thanks to these strange circumstances that Aziraphale and Crowley form an unlikely friendship. While very different in their nature, the two develop a unique bond over their shared affection for Earth and its inhabitants. This then leads them to team up to prevent the apocalypse.\n\nOf late, Good Omens has been a great comfort show to binge-watch. I found Sheen and Tennant\u2019s dynamic pretty heartwarming, and the premise was really enjoyable. There are currently two seasons out, with each season consisting of six episodes. There\u2019s no official word on when season 3 will release, but The Hollywood Reporter announced that the final season will \u201cwrap with a feature-length episode.\u201d\n\nThis might not exactly be a show you can finish over the weekend (unless you\u2019re really determined), but Jack Ryan is definitely an enjoyable watch. The series spans four seasons, with each season consisting of between six and eight episodes. The cast includes John Krasinski as Jack Ryan, Wendell Pierce as James Greer, and Betty Gabriel as Elizabeth Wright.\n\nThe story follows Jack Ryan, an up-and-coming CIA agent, who is thrust into high-risk field operations. Each season, Ryan faces increasingly complex threats that require him to travel across the globe. Although it\u2019s by no means a masterpiece, I liked this action series. It was fast-paced enough to keep me hooked, despite the story being a tad bit predictable at times. If you like shows in this genre, Jack Ryan won\u2019t disappoint.\n\nWatch Tales From the Loop on Amazon Prime Video\n\nTales From the Loop is a science fiction drama that is based on the artwork of Simon Stalenhag. It stars Duncan Joiner, Rebecca Hall, and Paul Schneider and is a one-season series that has around eight episodes, making it more than manageable for a weekend binge.\n\nThe story revolves around a mysterious machine called the Loop, which is capable of bending the laws of physics and other known phenomena. Each episode explores the lives of different characters as the Loop\u2019s abilities impact them. This show was fairly interesting, and the visuals were brilliant. My only criticism is that the pacing felt a little too slow in some episodes.\n\nThe Outlaws, which features a total of three short seasons, is a British crime thriller comedy. It stars Charles Babaloka, Clare Perkins, Christopher Walken, and Eleanor Tomlinson, among others, and follows seven strangers who come together to complete a Community Payback scheme.\n\nAs they work together, the group comes across a large sum of money, which becomes central to the plot. This incident sets off a chain of events that thrusts them deep into a web of crime and unexpected twists. All in all, I thought this show was brilliant, and the character arcs were exceptionally well-developed. It\u2019s got plenty of humor as well, which keeps things light, despite the tension and drama.\n\nFallout is one show I believe deserves a second season (and it might just be coming soon, if rumors are anything to go by). Now, this show has been wildly successful, so you\u2019ve probably heard about it, if not already watched it. But if you\u2019re yet to dive in, you\u2019re in for a treat.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war, the show follows survivors who navigate life in fallout bunkers called Vaults. Unbeknownst to them, each Vault is part of a larger experiment. Finally, a survivor, Lucy, begins to uncover the truth behind the creation of the Vaults. She eventually leaves her home in the underground Vault 33 to venture into the wasteland above in search of her father. Along the way, she meets other survivors and some of the harsher realities of the real world.\n\nI don\u2019t usually binge-watch shows in one sitting, but Fallout\u2019s gripping storyline kept me hooked. If you\u2019ve played the Fallout video game, you\u2019ll appreciate this show all the more. But even if you\u2019re new to the franchise, this show does a really good job of drawing you into its plot.\n\nThere are a lot of addictive mini-series with high IMDb ratings out there, but it can be hard to pick the right one if you\u2019re not sure what to expect from each. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for action or something more lighthearted, these are some of the best shows to check out this weekend.",

      "text": "Sometimes a full season commitment feels like too much. That\u2019s when a good mini-series hits the spot\u2014short, intense, and satisfying. These picks have the ratings to back them up and are impossible to stop watching once you start.\n10 Catch-22 (IMDb Rating: 7.7/10)\nWatch Catch-22 on Hulu\nMany of us will remember Joseph Heller\u2019s 1961 novel from English class, but I found the subsequent movie adaptations of Catch-22 to be quite underwhelming. This six-part 2019 reworking breathes new life into the source material, with standout performances from Kyle Chandler and George Clooney.\nCatch-22 is considered by many to be the quintessential tale of the futility of war, and it works much better when stretched out across several episodes. The cinematography, in particular, is impressive, especially in scenes of aerial combat.\n9 American Primeval (IMDb Rating: 8.0/10)\nWatch American Primeval on Netflix\nI feel like American Primeval is often slept upon. This polished six-part drama, set on the frontier during the birth of the American West, follows a mother and her son as they encounter corrupt Union soldiers, zany missionaries, hostile Native Americans, and depraved trappers while trying to make their way to California.\nStarring Taylor Kitsch and Betty Gilpin in strong leading roles, American Primeval takes no prisoners in demonstrating the hardships of frontier life. Sometimes violent, shocking, and depressing, this mini-series is nonetheless visually stunning and leaves you happy to be alive in the new millennium.\n8 Good Omens (IMDb Rating: 8.0/10)\nWatch Good Omens on Prime Video\nFans of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\u2019s fantasy novels will appreciate Good Omens. Originally planned as a limited series based on the authors\u2019 1990 collaboration, it was renewed for a second round, but season one stands alone as a tight and bingeable unit.\nStarring heavyweights David Tennant and Michael Sheen as a demon and an angel, respectively, the series is littered with irreverent humor and makes for good lighthearted viewing. A stellar supporting cast includes John Hamm and Frances McDormand as \u201cGod.\u201d\n7 Ripley (IMDb Rating: 8.1/10)\nWatch Ripley on Netflix\nI wasn\u2019t a great admirer of the 1999 movie The Talented Mr. Ripley. However, I found this eight-part adaptation of the crime thriller, written and directed by Steven Zaillian (writer of Schindler\u2019s List), to be absolutely compelling.\nThe series is shot entirely in black and white in stunning locations around Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast, which lends it a film noir aesthetic that adds to this slick production\u2019s appeal. Firm favorite Andrew Scott (of Sherlock) is outstanding in the title role, playing a hard-up grifter who is paid to retrieve a wealthy man\u2019s son from paradise\u2014before things take a very dark turn.\n6 The Queen\u2019s Gambit (IMDb Rating: 8.5/10)\nWatch Queen's Gambit on Netflix\nThe premise of a young woman venturing into the world of chess championships may sound boring on paper, but this seven-part mini-series immediately gripped me. Anya Taylor-Joy is enchanting as an orphan with a prodigious talent, and a strong supporting cast includes Harry Melling (of Harry Potter fame).\nThe Queen\u2019s Gambit is set against an authentic-looking 1960s backdrop, with costumes to match, which adds plenty of aesthetic appeal. Meanwhile, its fast-paced storyline makes it easy to binge right up until its captivating finale. This is a one-hit wonder that's well worth a rewatch.\n5 The Offer (IMDb Rating: 8.6/10)\nWatch The Offer on Paramount+\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the Godfather franchise, The Offer is essential viewing. It chronicles the fascinating story of the making of the original movie from the perspective of its producer, Albert S. Ruddy, played here by Miles Teller.\nThis ten-part behind-the-scenes limited series sometimes feels as much like a documentary as it does a drama, with its cool 1970s swagger and accurate sets that could be straight out of The Godfather. However, its real appeal lies in the wacky characters involved in the production, some of whom were bona fide members of Cosa Nostra.\n4 The Penguin (IMDb Rating: 8.6/10)\nWatch The Penguin on Max\nI was drawn to The Penguin after seeing press images of Colin Farrell\u2019s transformation into the titular character, which must be seen to be believed. Impressive makeup aside, this fast-paced eight-parter has much to offer, especially if you\u2019re a fan of the movie The Batman.\nSet in the Gotham City underworld, it follows Oswald \u201cOz\u201d Cobb as he rises from the rank of henchman to mob boss. Cristin Milioti and Rhenzy Feliz provide strong supporting roles as our antihero blunders and batters his way to the top.\n3 When They See Us (IMDb Rating: 8.8/10)\nWatch When They See Us on Netflix\nIt may be only four episodes in length, but When They See Us packs a very hard punch. Chronicling the suffering of the \u201cCentral Park Five,\u201d the group of teenagers wrongly accused of a brutal 1989 attack on a New York City jogger, this drama spans over a quarter of a century between their conviction and exoneration.\nWith a strong supporting cast, including John Leguizamo, Michael Kenneth Williams, and Felicity Huffman, it is the younger cast members, spearheaded by Asante Blackk, who provide the most powerful performances.\n2 Chernobyl (IMDb Rating: 9.3/10)\nWatch Chernobyl on Max\nI have rewatched Chernobyl twice, once in its entirety on a long-haul flight, and it remains as compelling as ever with each viewing. It follows the events surrounding the 1986 explosion of the eponymous nuclear power plant, as well as the subsequent response and cleanup efforts, with Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Emily Watson in leading roles.\nChernobyl can be a tough watch, as we begin to understand the reality of the situation and the sacrifices that had to be made on that fateful day. This five-part drama is at times so intense that it\u2019s hard to believe the disaster actually happened.\n1 Band of Brothers (IMDb Rating: 9.4/10)\nWatch Band of Brothers on Max\nBand of Brothers is widely regarded as one of the greatest depictions of World War II ever committed to celluloid. Based on the novel by Stephen Ambrose and executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, this gritty ten-part drama follows \u201cEasy Company\u201d of the 101st Airborne Division on their campaign across Europe from before D-Day to the liberation of Germany.\nDerived from the letters and journals of the men on the front lines, and interspersed with interviews with the survivors themselves, this exquisite drama brings the harsh realities of war to life. It will stay with you long after the final credits roll."

      "text": "Everyone has those days when you need to escape the world around you, and that's when you need a proper comfort show for distraction. Now, everyone has different go-to's, but when the world is acting up, these shows are there to sooth the soul.\n10 Parks and Recreation\nWatch It on Netflix\nSet in the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana, this zany show follows the exploits of the Parks and Recreation department, headed by the relentlessly positive Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). The laughs are centered around small-town absurdity and a mix of colorful personalities, in an environment where it\u2019s cool to get along.\nParks and Recreation is ideal comfort viewing, as the characters are lovable, the stakes are low, and it\u2019s brimming with familiar faces from the world of comedy. Notable cast members include Adam Scott, Nick Offerman, Chris Pratt, Rashida Jones, and Aubrey Plaza.\n9 Detectorists\nWatch It on Prime Video\nThis gentle British gem follows two metal detector hobbyists searching for treasure\u2014and possibly a little meaning\u2014in the English countryside. With its slow pace, dry wit, and rural beauty, Detectorists is like an audiovisual meditation, featuring Mackenzie Crook (The Office) and firm favorite Toby Jones in the leading roles.\nWhere Detectorists really succeeds is in its ability to find drama, intrigue, and delight in the mundane aspects of life. It provides the perfect pressure valve whenever I need to let off steam.\n8 Brooklyn Nine-Nine\nWatch It on Netflix\nThis sitcom, set in a New York City police precinct, pounds you with quickfire humor but is supported by underlying principles of camaraderie and inclusivity. Brooklyn Nine-Nine thrives on the chemistry between its oddball ensemble cast and the \u201cbromance\u201d between Andy Samberg\u2019s goofy-yet-brilliant detective and his police chief, the late Andre Braugher.\nWhile Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019s storylines aren\u2019t as compelling in later seasons, the jokes are consistently there, and the characters are always lovable and relatable. This is bingeable escapist comedy at its best.\n7 Schitt\u2019s Creek\nWatch It on Hulu\nWatching the formerly wealthy Rose family adjust to life in a rural motel might not sound like comfort TV, but don't pause or cancel your Hulu subscription until you've given Schitt\u2019s Creek a watch. Over six seasons, this tale of riches to rags evolves from sharp satire to a heartfelt celebration of growth, love, and acceptance.\nStarring father and son duo, Dan and Eugene Levy (of American Pie fame), alongside comedy legends Catherine O\u2019Hara and Chris Elliott, this is peak serotonin on the small screen, with Moira\u2019s wigs worthy of their own mention as supporting characters.\n6 Bob\u2019s Burgers\nWatch It on FOX\nThis animated series about a struggling burger joint run by the Belcher family is packed with warmth and weirdness. Unlike many family sitcoms, the Belchers actually like each other, and their unconditional support, no matter how absurd the situation, is deeply comforting.\nI often draw comparisons between the Belchers and my own family, as they blunder their way through life, with standout performances from Kristen Schaal and H. Jon Benjamin, and regular guest appearances by Kevin Kline. As a bonus, the musical numbers are wildly catchy.\n5 Ted Lasso\nWatch It on Apple TV+\nThe premise for this Apple TV favorite was especially compelling, as an American football coach with no experience in soccer is hired to manage an English football team. What sounds like a setup for disaster turns out to be a show about kindness, self-belief, and the importance of mental health.\nTed Lasso is heartfelt, funny, and surprisingly profound, like a pep talk you didn\u2019t know you needed. You find yourself caring deeply about the characters, and the pacing is brisk, from the first episode to the last.\n4 The Great British Baking Show\nWatch It on Netflix\nThe Great British Baking Show had no right to become the hit that it did. It's fundamentally a bunch of amateur bakers in a tent, trying their best to impress judges with elaborate pastries, yet the result is wholesome, gentle competition at its finest.\nThe British countryside setting, fun judging panel, and supportive contestants make this a show you can watch with your brain half off. However, the more you watch, the more captivating it becomes, and you might find yourself headed down a rabbit hole of baked goods and sugary treats before you know it.\n3 The Office (U.S.)\nWatch It on Netflix\nThere\u2019s something especially comforting about the Dunder Mifflin crew, headed by Steve Carell\u2019s lovable idiot, Michael Scott. The awkward moments, quirky coworkers, and office romances feel warmly familiar, and it reminds us that we\u2019re not alone in the trials and tribulations that we experience in the workplace.\nIt\u2019s also a great show to have on in the background while you scroll your phone or eat dinner, and I must have played The Office in its entirety quite a few times after leaving college, simply to have some company while I did household chores.\n2 Avatar: The Last Airbender\nWatch It on Netflix\nAnimation is often overlooked as a serious medium. However, don\u2019t let the \u201ckids show\u201d label fool you, as Avatar: The Last Airbender is profoundly written, beautifully animated, and emotionally deep.\nThis is a story about life\u2019s balance, friendship, and the struggle between good and evil. There\u2019s action, humor, and plenty of heart, making it the ideal binge whenever you need an escape and inspiration.\n1 The Good Place\nWatch It on Netflix\nThe Good Place is top-tier existential humor, answering the question of what happens after we die with surprising philosophical depth and quickfire wit. Kristen Bell heads an ensemble cast as she realizes that she got into heaven by mistake.\nWhat follows is four seasons of thoughtful and uplifting comedy that deftly sidesteps the Netflix two-season curse. It reminds us that ethics matter, growth is possible, and best friends can be found in the afterlife, with comedy veteran Ted Danson providing the perfect foil.\nNext time it all feels like too much, why not grab a blanket, turn off your notifications, and let one of these shows remind you that not everything in life has to be so serious. Sometimes, the best thing we can do for our mental health is to hit play and tune out life\u2019s difficulties with some warm and meaningful entertainment and as many snacks as we see fit."

      "text": "The third and final season of Good Omens at Prime Video will stretch \u2014 or maybe shrink \u2014 the definition of \u201cseason\u201d in TV terms.\nThe Amazon-owned streamer announced Thursday that the series, which stars Michael Sheen and David Tennant and is based on Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\u2019s novel, will end with a single, feature-length episode. The 90-minute installment is set to begin production early next year in Scotland.\nPrime Video also noted that Gaiman won\u2019t be involved in production on the series ender (though he did contribute to its writing). Earlier this year, five women accused the author of sexual assault; their claims are detailed in a podcast titled Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman. He has denied any wrongdoing but offered to step away from the final Good Omens to let the production go forward and conclude the story.\nRelated Stories\nThe streamer renewed Good Omens for a final season in December 2023. The show centers on the angel Aziraphale (Sheen) and demon Crowley (Tennant), who need to work together to avert Armageddon. The show began life as a limited series, but its success led to a renewal for a second season, which streamed in July 2023.\nRob Wilkins of Narrativia, representing Pratchett\u2019s estate, and BBC Studios Productions\u2019 head of comedy Josh Cole will executive produce the final season/episode. Good Omens comes from Amazon MGM Studios, BBC Studios Productions and Narrativia.\nPrime Video also has another Gaiman adaptation, Anansi Boys, on its roster. That show has completed production but doesn\u2019t have a premiere date yet (it\u2019s likely to be pushed into 2025). Both Anansi Boys and Good Omens were products of a first-look deal between Gaiman and Amazon; The Hollywood Reporter has asked for comment on the status of the deal.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

      "text": "Some very good TV shows run for only a season, either by design or because they were canceled due to low viewership. However, some of these might have been even better with a second.\nOf the one-season wonders that have aired in recent years, these are my absolute favorites.\n7 The Queen's Gambit (2020)\nWatch The Queen's Gambit on Netflix\nThis award-winning Netflix series starred Anya Taylor-Joy in the title role. It told the story of an orphaned chess prodigy named Beth Harmon in the 1950s and 1960s who went on to dominate a male-dominated chess world. Through seven episodes, we see her struggle with alcohol and drugs. The series culminates with a confrontation between Harmon and her nemesis, Vasily Borgov, in a world chess championship.\nThe Queen's Gambit ended on a high note, and we can imagine that Taylor-Joy's character went on to live a life full of promise both in her career and personal life. However, several unresolved questions remained unanswered that would have made for an intriguing second season.\nOverall, The Queen's Gambit is perhaps one of the best one-season TV series in the history of the media. If you haven't seen it, go for it. You'll be glad that you did\u2014it's another addictive mini-series you can binge-watch.\n6 The Night Of (2016)\nWatch The Night Of on HBO Max\nThe Night Of from HBO presents an eight-part miniseries that delivers both captivating and depressing content. The story follows Nasir \"Naz\" Khan through his mostly sad journey as a Pakistani-American college student from Queens, New York, who becomes accused of murder. Throughout the series, we observe Naz transform from an optimistic young man anticipating his future into a person who loses his identity completely. The series also illustrates how the U.S. justice system often fails to provide equal legal protection to all citizens.\nThe series finale presents a conclusion for Naz, but certainly one that most audiences didn\u2019t expect when it first aired. It\u2019s because of this that I couldn\u2019t see how Naz\u2019s story could have been continued into future seasons.\nAnd yet, The Night Of could have returned with fresh and powerful crime-based storylines that revolved around its talented supporting cast, which included John Turturro (from Severance), Glenn Headly, and others. The characters possessed just enough depth in their backstories and complex personalities, which could have supported engaging new storylines.\n5 Station Eleven (2021-22)\nWatch Station Eleven on HBO Max\nPost-apocalyptic stories aren't new, and many come and go without resolution. HBO's Station Eleven is one of those that, honestly, I forgot about until doing research for this article.\nTold over ten episodes, Station Eleven follows various characters before, during, and after a devastating flu pandemic known as the \"Georgia Flu,\" which wipes out most of the world's population. Like many series, Station Eleven's biggest strength was its cast, which is headlined by Mackenzie Davis, Himesh Patel, Daniel Zovatto, and others.\nThough Station Eleven ended on a hopeful note, it's not a satisfying ending by any stretch of the imagination. The fate of many characters in this series remained unresolved, nor were most of the integral stories. Its early demise likely had something to do with the arrival of another end-of-the-world HBO series, The Last of Us, a year later. From day one, that series had a bigger baked-in following since it's based on a popular video game series.\n4 Watchmen (2019)\nWatch Watchmen on HBO Max\nHBO also aired the critically acclaimed television series Watchmen, which drew inspiration from the famous graphic novel of the same name. The story takes place in an alternate 1985 world where superheroes exist, but the \"Keene Act\" has made them illegal.\nThe show was about retired and active heroes who struggled with the ethical dilemmas of their past actions while dealing with the psychological weight of their superhero personas. The plot began when one of their own was brutally murdered, which triggered a conspiracy that exposed many truths.\nThe central conflict of Watchmen was resolved, but, like the graphic novel, it ended with at least one unresolved question. Unlike some series that didn't continue due to low ratings, the fate of Watchmen was decided by its creator and showrunner, Damon Lindelof, who chose not to pursue future seasons.\n3 Godless (2017)\nWatch Godless on Netflix\nAnother Netflix series that failed to get a second-season pickup is Godless. Told in seven parts, the Western drama tells the story of the one-armed outlaw Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Roy Goode (Jack O\u2019Connell). Along for the thrilling ride is Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey). It centers on a unique western town, La Belle, that\u2019s mostly populated by women after a tragic mining accident killed most of the men.\nThe main storyline in Godless gets resolved after a violent and bloody shootout leaves one of the main characters dead. That was reason enough for the series not to get picked up for a second season. And yet, there were plenty of unanswered questions that could have made this possible.\nIf you like westerns and don\u2019t have time to commit to endless episodes, Godless is probably for you. It features a mostly satisfying ending that\u2019s worth your time.\n2 Anatomy of a Scandal (2022)\nWatch Anatomy of a Scandal on Netflix\nBased on the novel of the same name by Sarah Vaughan, Anatomy of a Scandal is a courtroom drama and psychological thriller that will keep you guessing through its six episodes. It stars Sienna Miller and Rupert Friend as the perfect couple who watch their lives unravel after Friend\u2019s character is accused of rape. Like Godless, Anatomy of a Scandal also features Michelle Dockery, who stars as the prosecutor handling the rape case.\nA lot happens during this series, which explores various themes, including consent, class, and the abuse of power. In the end, there\u2019s a well-deserved resolution to the series\u2019 biggest storyline, although many questions remain that could have justified a second season. However, for the most part, it did manage to convey its source material, which means it still works well in just one season.\n1 Night Sky (2022)\nWatch Night Sky on Amazon Prime Video\nScience fiction dramas often aren\u2019t around long enough for their entire story to be told. So is the case for Prime Video\u2019s Night Sky, which starred Academy Award winners Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons as an elderly couple with a massive secret in their backyard: a portal to an alien planet.\nTold over eight episodes, Night Sky was a slow-burner that reached its peak at just the right time. Unfortunately, that\u2019s when the series came to an end with apparently no resolution.\nNight Sky is absolutely an unfinished series, and I was surprised when its producers weren\u2019t given a second season. So many questions were left unanswered, and it would have been a joy to see Spacek and Simon return and get more screen time together. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not going to happen. Despite its premature ending, Night Sky is still worth enjoying nonetheless. Please be aware that the ending may disappoint due to its many unresolved stories.\nStill not satisfied?
