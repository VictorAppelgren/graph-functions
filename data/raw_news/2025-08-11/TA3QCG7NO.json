  "content": "\u2022 The skills gap in AI workplaces is as much human as it is technical\n\nAs AI tools become more and more embedded in our everyday work, new research claims the challenge of not getting the best out of them may not lie solely with the technology.\n\nA report from Multiverse has identified thirteen core human skillsets which could determine whether companies fully realize AI\u2019s potential.\n\nThe study warns without deliberate attention to these capabilities, investment in AI writer systems, LLM applications, and other AI tools could fall short of expectations.\n\nThe Multiverse study draws from observation of AI users at varying experience levels, from beginners to experts, employing methods such as the Think Aloud Protocol Analysis.\n\nParticipants verbalised their thought processes while using AI to complete real-world tasks.\n\nFrom this, researchers built a framework grouping the identified skills into four categories: cognitive skills, responsible AI skills, self-management, and communication skills.\n\nAmong the cognitive abilities, analytical reasoning, creativity, and systems thinking were found to be essential for evaluating AI outputs, pushing innovation, and predicting AI responses.\n\nResponsible AI skills included ethics, such as spotting bias in outputs, and cultural sensitivity to address geographic or social context gaps.\n\nSelf-management covered adaptability, curiosity, detail orientation, and determination, traits that influence how people refine their AI interactions.\n\nCommunication skills included tailoring AI-generated outputs for audience expectations, engaging empathetically with AI as a thought partner, and exchanging feedback to improve performance.\n\nReports from academic institutions, including MIT, have raised concerns reliance on generative AI can reduce critical thinking, a phenomenon linked to \u201ccognitive offloading.\u201d\n\nThis is the process where people delegate mental effort to machines, risking erosion of analytical habits.\n\nWhile AI tools can process vast amounts of information at speed, the research suggests they cannot replace the nuanced reasoning and ethical judgement that humans contribute.\n\nThe Multiverse researchers note that companies focusing solely on technical training may overlook the \u201csoft skills\u201d required for effective collaboration with AI.\n\nLeaders may assume their AI tool investments address a technology gap when in reality, they face a combined human-technology challenge.\n\nThe study refrains from claiming AI inevitably weakens human cognition, but instead it argues the nature of cognitive work is shifting, with less emphasis on memorising facts and more on knowing how to access, interpret, and verify information.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 These are the best AI website builders around\n\u2022 Take a look at our pick of the best internet security suites\n\u2022 The biggest heist of all time involved over $14 billion of crypto being stolen - and it went undetected for five years",

      "text": "As the promise of AI to rapidly reshape industries intensifies, the gap between having an understanding of AI capabilities and the skills to implement AI solutions continues to widen. This divide is particularly pronounced between senior leadership, who drive digital transformation, and frontline workers, who are expected to implement and adapt to these changes and use this technology in their everyday work.\nRecent research highlights the consequences of the AI skills gap, with one-third of UK employees feeling unprepared to adopt AI in the next one to three years. This disconnect between strategy and day-to-day execution on the ground is further underscored by the fact that 77% of UK tech workers admit to pretending they know more about AI than they actually do \u2013 illustrating the urgent need for organizations to bridge this gap and promote organization-wide AI literacy.\nTo address this divide, businesses must move beyond top-down mandates and build AI literacy across their entire workforce. Let\u2019s explore why its important to act now, and how to achieve this in a scalable and effective way.\nChief Information Officer at Skillsoft.\nWhy businesses need AI literacy now\nAccording to the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Future of Jobs Report, 39% of current skills in the workforce will become outdated within the next five years, with skills gaps remaining the biggest obstacle to organizational preparedness for future markets. As AI transforms ways of working and skills gaps widen, organizations must act now to equip employees with the knowledge necessary to understand AI applications and leverage them effectively.\nFirst and foremost, businesses must recognize that AI literacy is no longer a nice-to-have, but a necessity. Employees need a foundational understanding of how AI works, where it adds business value and how it can be integrated into daily operations.\nAI has the power to enhance efficiency, streamline workflows and improve business operations, transforming organizations across industries. A key element to upskilling efforts beyond understanding general AI capabilities is equipping team members with the ability to identify the opportunities for AI. They should also focus on building the mindset and awareness required to use AI effectively.\nFor IT professionals, understanding AI fundamentals, such as ethical use, large language modelling and data privacy, is crucial. But technical proficiency alone isn\u2019t enough. Power skills, like critical thinking, communication, experimentation, curiosity and resilience, will be equally important for navigating complex environments and driving innovation. A combination of technical and power skills ensures employees can thrive in their current roles, adapt to evolving technologies and build skills for the future.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nTo embed AI literacy across the entire organization, leadership must take an active role in championing AI literacy initiatives. Without visible executive support, companies risk fragmented adoption and widening disparities in AI understanding between senior leaders and frontline workers. AI must be embraced holistically across all levels, from the boardroom to the frontline.\nAssessing existing skillsets\nWith concern over the AI skills gap growing, 66% of C-Suite executives plan to recruit external AI-skilled talent, while 34% intend to \u2018build\u2019 talent internally by training existing employees. This split reflects the broader challenge of staying competitive in a landscape where AI capabilities are impacting the business landscape at a rapid pace.\nHowever, as skill lifespans shorten, especially in areas like machine learning, generative AI and data science, businesses can\u2019t solely rely on external hires to stay ahead. The pace of change means that today\u2019s skills can quickly become outdated and hiring new talent each time a skill becomes obsolete is not sustainable or cost-effective. Instead, organizations should strike a balance between hiring new talent and investing in continuous learning and reskilling for existing teams.\nThis starts by assessing the existing skillsets in their team. By conducting baseline evaluations, businesses can compare current skills against benchmarks to identify areas for improvement. This targeted approach ensures learning initiatives are relevant, measurable and aligned with strategic business goals, maximising resource efficiency and impact.\nBringing existing employees along on this journey by assessing their existing AI skills and upskilling them appropriately will lead to deeper benefits beyond technical proficiency. This approach also boosts employee retention by demonstrating a clear investment in their growth while also improving the quality of and engagement in their work.\nCreating an AI literacy framework\nRather than relying on ad hoc training sessions, organizations should establish structured, strategic AI literacy programs that equip frontline workers with the knowledge and skills required to identify AI use cases and drive AI adoption. Building this requires a multifaceted approach to learning, including programs that provide access to foundational AI and data skills, but they are only one piece of the puzzle.\nPrograms such as instructor-led sessions that contextualize AI within specific roles and industries and simulation-based learning allow employees to engage with realistic, AI-powered scenarios. By embedding these learning experiences into workforce development, organizations can future-proof their workforce with the skills needed for the AI revolution.\nAdditionally, continuous learning and adaptability must be central to organizational culture, equipping employees with current and future required skilling opportunities, as technical skill lifespans shorten. Creating AI literacy frameworks ultimately helps teams stay ahead of technological shifts while building overall resilience.\nAchieving organization-wide AI literacy\nAI literacy is no longer just for tech teams. It\u2019s a business imperative across the entire workforce. For businesses to reduce the AI skills gap, it becomes even more crucial to bridge the divide between senior leadership and frontline workers.\nBy assessing existing skill sets, implementing comprehensive AI upskilling throughout the organization and fostering a culture of continuous learning, businesses can build an AI-ready workforce that is both prepared for and on board with their business strategy.\nWe've featured the best productivity tool.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "The best internet security suites for 2025: ranked and rated by the expert\nThe best internet security suites for PCs, Macs and mobile devices, reviewed by the experts\n- Top 3 internet security suites\n- Best overall internet security suite\n- Best internet security suite for families\n- Best internet security suite for multiple devices\n- Best internet security suite for beginners\n- Best value internet security suite\n- Best internet security suite with VPN\n- Best configurable internet security suite\n- Fastest internet security suite\n- Internet security suites FAQs\nThe best internet security suites are one of the best ways to protect a whole household of devices. Offering coverage across multiple platforms and operating systems, these comprehensive packages often provide the best antivirus, firewall protection, parental controls, a VPN, password manager, and so much more.\nMy team of experts here at TechRadar Pro have spent tens of thousands of hours testing and reviewing hundreds of security products, so we'd like to think we know a thing or two about what makes a good cybersecurity tool.\nIn our reviews, we look at AV-TEST scores for each antivirus package, before going on to examine just how each part of the internet security suite ticks. Whether its VPN server count, inclusion of ransomware protection, or insurance included with identity theft protection.\nBitdefender Total Security remains my top pick for most people, thanks to it's near-perfect scoring across multiple antivirus and security evaluations, attractive price point, and extra features.\nTop 3 internet security suites in 2025\nIn a hurry? Here are our top 3 picks for internet security suites:\n1. Bitdefender Total Security: best overall internet security suite\nOur top recommendation, Bitdefender Total Security offers the best-in-class security for you and your devices.\nFeatures include multi-layered ransomware protection, parental controls, firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner and more.\nPlus with a 30-day free trial, you can give Bitdefender Total Security a go, risk-free.\n2. Norton 360 Deluxe: best internet security suite for families\nNorton 360 Deluxe is a great choice for families as it offers not only parental controls but also a VPN, online backup and dark web monitoring in addition to 50GB of online backup storage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe offers this top-class protection for to 5 devices, and has offerings for both iOS and Android.\n3. Avast One: a great all-round internet security suite\nAvast One offers protection against malicious software, webcam security and data breach monitoring, all wrapped up in one easy-to-use interface.\nNot only that, with Avast One you can protect up to 30 devices with web protection, a VPN, and Avast's Sensitive Data Shield, which adds an extra layer of protection to your private data.\nBest overall internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a whole host of features.\n\u2714\ufe0f You use devices across a range of operating systems - Bitdefender can be used on iOS, Android, Mac and Windows.\n\u274c You have an older CPU as its performance may be impacted.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with advanced PC maintenance tools.\nBitdefender Total Security is the well-respected security firm\u2019s top-of-the-range package and tops the lot when it comes to all-singing all-dancing internet security suites.\nTotal Security is a suite that\u2019s positively bristling with features. You get \u2013 deep breath \u2013 standard antivirus tools plus impressively capable multi-layered ransomware protection, a firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser (Safepay) for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner (to check for missing apps and OS updates), password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam and microphone defenses, and more besides including a superb web protection module for blocking malicious URLs.\nAs well as security features, Total Security provides various PC maintenance and optimization tools. These are somewhat useful in themselves, for cleaning out superfluous files and streamlining boot times \u2013 but more importantly, Bitdefender\u2019s flagship package also covers more than just Windows devices.\nIn fact, an app is provided for Mac users (the software is compatible with M1 Macs, and has been improved to run faster virus scans), as well as clients for iOS and Android mobiles. The Android app also has the capability to block more link-based mobile threats.\nAs it\u2019s only a bit more expensive than Bitdefender Internet Security \u2013 the firm\u2019s mid-tier security suite \u2013 I'd say it\u2019s certainly worthwhile upgrading to Total Security if you have multiple devices across various platforms to protect. (You can see what we think of the range in our full Bitdefender review).\nThere is further good news in that Bitdefender has a minimal impact on system performance, going by independent and my own testing (some rivals do a touch better in this department, but it\u2019s not a difference you\u2019ll ever notice in real-world use).\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s a 30-day free trial of this suite, with no payment details needed; you just have to supply an email address. That means you can try out Bitdefender for a full month before committing to buying and see first-hand for yourself exactly what\u2019s on offer here.\nBest internet security suite for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with an integrated VPN.\n\u2714\ufe0f You're looking for an internet security suite for the whole family.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite that doesn't use a lot of resources.\n\u274c You have more than 5 devices you want to use the internet security suite on.\nWhen I evaluated all of NortonLifeLock\u2019s security suite options, I picked out Norton 360 Deluxe as the best value all-around choice for anyone who\u2019s looking to protect more than a single device \u2013 which is likely the majority of folks.\nNorton delivers good basic protection \u2013 although some of the independent test lab results have been a little mixed \u2013 alongside a wealth of features, including webcam protection and dark web monitoring (for users in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and a few other countries), an impressively smart firewall, plus a system of parental controls.\nThe parental controls are top-notch, by the way, including in-depth monitoring systems to keep an eye on what your kids are doing online, and even GPS tracking for their mobile devices. Norton\u2019s very strong in this department.\nThere are some truly worthwhile extras included here, too, like a fully integrated Norton VPN that massively adds to the value proposition of this suite (assuming you don\u2019t have a VPN already, of course), and 50GB of cloud backup storage that's another handy bonus.\nAs for negative points, a flaw worth bearing in mind is that I found Norton 360 Deluxe had more of a drag on system performance than most internet security suites in my own testing. That said, it\u2019s rated as about average in this department by independent test lab AV-Comparatives, and odds are you likely won\u2019t even notice any impact on the speed of your system in everyday usage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe covers up to five devices, either Windows or Mac PCs, plus there are mobile apps for Android and iOS. Pricing is highly competitive compared to rivals, particularly given that bundled VPN, so you should definitely consider this Norton package (compare it to the company\u2019s other offerings with our guide to choosing your Norton plan) \u2013 especially for family usage with those very thorough parental controls.\nBest internet security suite for multiple devices\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a top-rated antivirus engine.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want your internet security suite to cover a lot of devices.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with a fast VPN service.\nAvast One is the trusted security outfit\u2019s revamped suite which offers an umbrella of protection across various bases. That means not just antivirus and ransomware defenses, but also a firewall, webcam protection, data breach monitoring, and a software updater to keep apps patched up with no need for user intervention.\nOn top of that, Avast One provides a full VPN (with unlimited data \u2013 although it\u2019s not the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen, by any means), and some device speed-up and maintenance tools.\nThere are also some more unusual features like a Sensitive Data Shield which scans drives for files that may contain sensitive info like passwords and phone numbers and stops other users of a device from accessing these. In short, you get a lot with the paid subscription of Avast One (there\u2019s a free version which is impressive, too, but it drops a number of features, and the VPN function is limited).\nAll this is wrapped up in a smart and easy-to-use interface which has been thoughtfully redesigned for Avast One, and the cherry on top is the strength of the protection delivered. Avast\u2019s antivirus engine is rated as excellent by the independent test labs, and its web protection is among the best around, too. Furthermore, system slowdown is negligible when running this suite.\nOverall, Avast One packs in a lot of features, and while some of these capabilities may not be as robust as the top performers in this roundup, the sheer weight of what you\u2019re getting means this is one of the best all-rounders out there.\nBest internet security suite for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with great ransomware protection.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a user-friendly interface.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with configuration options for experts.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Trend Micro\u2019s flagship security suite \u2013 Trend Micro Maximum Security \u2013 not the least of which is its polished and user-friendly interface, backed up by superb virus protection. Trend Micro is highly ranked by the independent testing labs, and it offers sterling multi-layered anti-ransomware defenses, too.\nThe package also gives you first-class URL filtering for safer web browsing, further bolstering the overall defenses provided here. That said, one slight weak point with Trend Micro\u2019s offering is that there isn\u2019t a huge amount of low-level control \u2013 such as virus scan options \u2013 so more demanding users may find it lacking here.\nMaximum Security provides parental controls, social media privacy features and PC maintenance tools, although the latter isn\u2019t its strongest suit. It also boasts data theft prevention countermeasures, a secure vault for storing sensitive files, and a decent integrated password manager.\nLess tech-savvy types will appreciate the ease-of-use here, which also goes for the capable mobile apps. There\u2019s a 30-day trial as well, so you can thoroughly check all this out for yourself before pulling the trigger on a purchase.\nBest value internet security suite\n5. McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a high-quality spam filter.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a good value internet security suite.\n\u274c You want a robust malware protection.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with an advanced VPN.\nAs the name suggests, McAfee\u2019s basic security product, Total Protection Individual, only covers one individual device. And if you\u2019re thinking of buying that, and you own more than just a Windows PC, then you\u2019re almost certainly better off purchasing McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device.\nFor not much more money at all you get a sound internet security suite which protects up to five Windows, ChromeOS, or Mac computers, and Android or iOS devices. US customers also benefit from a useful additional extra in the form of identity theft protection.\nMcAfee\u2019s interface is simple and streamlined, which keeps things easy for beginners, although it\u2019ll likely be too sparse for more experienced users. The UI also suffers from some annoying quirks, but nothing too frustrating.\nIndependent test lab reports suggest McAfee Total Protection offers solid enough defenses, if not class-leading. Indeed, evaluations of McAfee\u2019s antivirus engine vary, with some being more scathing than others.\nOverall, McAfee\u2019s suite represents reasonable value and a decent choice in the Multi-Device package, with some nifty extras for boosting web browsing and app performance, plus an integrated (but very basic) free VPN that\u2019s commendably user-friendly.\nBest internet security suite with VPN\n6. Avira Prime\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust cyber security features.\nThis is an interesting one in that Avira\u2019s top-level package is missing some of the core security features you might find in other internet security suites, but it more than makes up for this in other ways which might be tempting depending on your own personal needs and use case.\nSo, while a firewall and parental controls might be missing from Avira Prime \u2013 or a backup facility (save for a contacts backup feature on the iOS app) \u2013 you do get some nifty stuff instead. That includes a decent VPN and some seriously high-quality PC maintenance tools.\nIf you want those speed-up tools, and/or have been considering getting a VPN as well as a new security suite, then Prime could be a perfect fit. In fact, in the latter case, Avira Prime works out as storming value for money, providing a solid engine to keep you safe, and that Avira VPN on top to keep you safer still online. Others, however, may miss the aforementioned core suite features like parental controls, of course.\nBest configurable internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that is highly configurable.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with with cloud analysis that picks up undetected threats.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust, powerful security features.\nESET Smart Security Premium packs in a lot of features including parental controls, webcam protection, network monitoring, additional network protection, and an anti-theft feature for Windows devices allowing for location tracking is an interesting bonus. Furthermore, Linux systems are covered here, as well as Windows and Mac computers.\nHowever, while ESET delivers lots of features, their quality can be variable. For example, the system of parental controls is very barebones, but the password manager is well fleshed out. ESET also offers plenty of configuration options, which will please experts, although computing novices may find it tricky to get to grips with in some respects.\nESET\u2019s antivirus protection seems solid, albeit with some mixed evaluations from independent testing labs. It\u2019s also worth noting that the suite\u2019s defenses have recently been bolstered with Live Guard, an extra layer of cloud analysis to detect newly emerged threats.\nSmart Security Premium provides some interesting extras, too, including the aforementioned password manager, and a secure, encrypted file vault to protect any sensitive data on your PC, which some folks will doubtless find very useful additions.\nThat said, unless you really want this additional functionality, it\u2019s not the best value for money internet security suite out there.\nFastest internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want to use the it on iOS.\n\u274c You want top-of-the-range antivirus protection.\nWebroot majors in being incredibly lightweight and fast-performing. Indeed, it has a minuscule memory footprint, and takes up next to no space on your system drive, as the product\u2019s virus definitions are all stored in the cloud.\nYet despite this minimal impact on your machine, Webroot Internet Security Plus comes with plenty of features. There\u2019s online banking protection, an Identity Shield to prevent data theft from the likes of keyloggers, ransomware defenses, an accurate anti-phishing system, a smart firewall, plus a password manager as you get a LastPass subscription bundled.\nDownsides? Well, you might get lightning quick malware scans, but Webroot hasn\u2019t fared very well in recent antivirus testing by the independent labs (or at least one of them, as the other big players don\u2019t evaluate this product). The accuracy of its engine is mixed at best, so that\u2019s a somewhat worrying question mark at the time of writing.\nStill, Internet Security Plus is a well-rounded package, and as we pointed out in our review, Windows users could always run it alongside the free Microsoft Defender to get the benefit of Webroot\u2019s bonus features, while doubling up on protection. The company\u2019s 70-day \u2018no questions asked\u2019 money-back guarantee is also noteworthy, showing Webroot\u2019s confidence in its suite.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nMarch 2025 Update - I have updated this guide to reflect accurate pricing and capabilities, alongside devices-per-license and compatibility. Bullguard Premium Protection used to appear on this list. However, Bullguard products were removed from the market on July 25, 2022 after the company was acquired by Norton. Kaspersky Total Security Anti-Virus used to appear on this list. Considering the current climate however, we've taken the decision to remove the provider. Although much of the company's core processes are now take place in Switzerland, the fact that its headquarters remain in Moscow and there have been previous allegations around government coercion, it feels prudent to use the provider with caution. And, when there are so many other excellent providers to choose from, it's impossible to whole-heartedly recommend Kaspersky at this time.\nInternet security suites FAQs\nWhat is the best internet security suite for 2025?\nWhile there are excellent internet security suites out there from names such as Norton, Avast and Trend Micro, we think Bitdefender Total Security is the best you can get right now.\nAvailable to use on up to 10 devices (including Windows, Macs, Android and iOS) Total Security combines super string virus protection with numerous extra features that genuinely add value to the package.\nFor example, a single subscription includes ransomware protection, firewall, Wi-Fi security advisor, secure browser. file shredder, vulnerability scanner, password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam, microphone defenses and more!\nIt's also really easy to set up and use, while not even being that expensive.\nWhat should I look for in an internet security suite?\nAll of the products on this list offer effective capabilities, so the difference is in additional capabilities. If there is a particular type of threat that concerns you, such as ransomware or phishing, check to see if there are specific protections included.\nBanking safeguards, firewalls and parental controls are also areas you should consider \u2013 especially if there are multiple users on your computer. And of course, you should consider whether you need protection across multiple devices, such as smartphones.\nThe number of additional features and devices may impact cost though.\nFinally, think about usability and the impact on system performance. Do you want a high level of customization or do you want an easy-to-use interface and do you want a program that is capable of fast scans or one that requires minimal system resources?\nDo I really need an internet security suite?\nIt\u2019s certainly true that a good entry-level antivirus will deliver strong core defenses against malware, so why would you want to think about getting one of the best internet security suites?\nAfter all, don\u2019t all apps from the same vendor use the exact same antivirus engine, giving you the same fundamental protection \u2013 while a suite demands a heftier price tag?\nOf course, you\u2019ll get more features with internet security suites, but one perception is that these maybe aren\u2019t all that critical to protect your device. And in some cases, this is true; they\u2019re just nice extras to have.\nBut in other cases, you might get capabilities like secure file vaults for your sensitive data, or a secure browser with which to engage in the likes of online banking \u2013 all of which provide worthwhile additional safeguards. Then there are elements like a password manger, or bundled VPN, which again really bolster online security beyond core measures, if you don\u2019t already have these things.\nFeatures like a free VPN could add to the value proposition of an internet security suite in a big way \u2013 depending on your existing software and needs \u2013 and while we mentioned paying more for a suite compared to a basic antivirus, sometimes security vendors don\u2019t charge much more. Indeed, when deals and discounts come into play, it can be the case that there\u2019s barely any difference in price \u2013 and don\u2019t forget, internet security suites usually support a fair few more devices (which can be a major consideration if you need coverage for family members as well as yourself).\nWhat's the difference between antivirus and internet security suites?\nWhile antivirus software provides a basic level of protection for your system, full internet security expands on capabilities such as scanning files and software, activity monitoring and vulnerability search with features tailored for Internet use.\nIndeed, many internet security products are marketed as \u2018suites\u2019 because they contain several different programs that can be accessed by a single interface.\nThese might include a firewall, anti-spam controls, ad blockers, webcam protection, keylogger protection, parental controls and credit card safeguards. There might also be additional protection against web-specific types of malware such as spyware and adware.\nHowever running so many different types of program might mean that internet security suites use more of your system resources than conventional AV.\nCan I create my own free internet security suite?\nThere are many advantages to purchasing a premium internet security suite from a trusted vendor, but it is perfectly possible to create your own modular suite by picking the most suitable free products.\nWhile this might mean you save money, it does mean you have to do much of the work yourself. You will have to identify the best components, whether its virus protection, firewall or backup software, and fix any problems yourself.\nThe more components you introduce will increase complexity and system resource use. You will also suffer from the pitfalls of using free services such as frequent adverts urging you to upgrade.\nUsing a premium internet security suite means the vendor integrates several services into a single package that can be managed from a single interface. What\u2019s more, they might cover several different types of device and offer different tiers of protection.\nIf you do want to build out your own suite, then you can pick the best of individual components in the following advice guides:\n- Rescue disk\n- Encryption software\n- Anonymous browsing\n- Firewall\n- Cloud antivirus\n- Endpoint protection\n- Online cyber security courses\nIn our latest round of updates, we overhauled this page's layout and structure by adding a quick menu, boxouts to give you the pros and cons of the internet security suites on offer and clearer headings. We also double-checked the pricing, deals, server locations, and unblocking capabilities to make sure the information on this page was as accurate and up-to-date as possible.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.

      "text": "Best Large Language Models (LLMs) of 2025\nLLMs for business\nThe best Large Language Models (LLMs) make it simple and easy to set up, manage, and train your own AI models.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate natural and programming languages. LLMs can be used to help with a variety of tasks and each have their own degree of suitability and cost efficiency. For this guide we tested multiple individual models from the same foundational model where appropriate to find the best LLM.\nThis area of technology is moving particularly fast so while we endeavor to keep this guide as up to date as possible, you may want to check whether a newer model has been released and whether the cost efficiency for that model makes it a better choice.\nThese are the best LLMs of 2024 tested by us. We've picked one foundation LLM as best overall and selected individual models from a range of foundational models for each category.\nThe best LLMs of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest LLM overall\n1. OpenAI's GPT\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe majority of LLMs are based on a variation of the Transformer Architecture, a neural network architecture that was first documented in a 2017 research paper authored by 8 scientists working at Google. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer, also known as GPT, is one of several different foundational models used by tech firms to power the LLMs currently available on the market today. While there are several different types of GPT available today, the first, and arguably the most well-known, was introduced by OpenAI in 2018 as GPT-1.\nGPT models can be adapted by developers to tackle specific tasks and workloads, or used in a more general approach to cover a more broad range of applications. For example, Github Copilot uses a version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 that is specifically tuned to help programmers write code, while the EinsteinGPT model built into Salesforce cloud aims to enhance the experience of their customers by improving productivity for employees.\nIn November 2023, OpenAI announced they would enable ChatGPT subscribers to create custom GPTs using their own datasets, training data and even allow them to access database systems to pull data for analysis in real-time. OpenAI also plans to allow developers to publish and monetize their custom GPTs for other users and developers to use, so we might see some interesting releases over the next few years that build upon the core GPT models already available today.\nOpenAI is at the forefront of GPT development, releasing several different versions for public use over the last few years. While each subsequent release of OpenAI GPT has contained incremental improvements to its intelligence and capabilities, this has come at the price of reduced performance, and an increase to response latency and cost to use.\nGPT-3.5 was very quick and cost effective, but could often make mistakes or demonstrate bias, GPT-4 improved the capabilities and intelligence of the model at an increase cost to use and higher response latency. The latest release, GPT-4o, bucks the trend by being the most intelligent version yet, while reducing the cost to use and improving latency by a considerable margin.\nOut of the box, the GPT models from OpenAI provide a fantastic \u201cjack of all trades\u201d approach that is sufficient for most use cases today, while those looking for a more specialized or task specific approach can customize them to their needs. This makes GPT models a great option for those who need something that just works, without the need to train the models on their own datasets for them to become effective.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that, like with all LLMs on the market today, GPT models aren\u2019t immune to providing false, biased, or misleading responses. While the most recent releases are becoming more accurate and are less likely to generate bad responses, users should be careful when using information provided in an output and take the time to verify that it is accurate.\nBest LLM for coding\n2. GitHub Copilot\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGitHub is one of the largest and most recognisable developer platforms in use today and is used by many individuals and enterprises to store, manage and share their codebases, so it makes sense that they have also created an LLM for coding to help developers enhance the speed and efficiency of their work.\nGitHub Copilot is a coding assistant powered by the GPT-4 model from OpenAI that can be accessed via an extension within several commonly used IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Additionally, unlike other coding assistants, GitHub Copilot has an advantage over the competition by being natively integrated into GitHub.\nOriginally released in October 2021 and powered by OpenAI Codex, a modified version of the GPT-3 model, GitHub Copilot is a coding assistant that provides developers with a range of different tools that help them to understand new and existing codebases or code snippets, write blocks code quickly and efficiently, and help troubleshoot issues. It can also help write test cases for automated testing and can help inspire you with solutions to problems you encounter.\nIn November 2023, GitHub Copilot was updated to use the GPT-4 model to further improve its capabilities. With the recent release of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model, it makes sense to speculate that GitHub Copilot could be updated to use the latest version in the future but there has been no confirmation if or when that may happen at the moment.\nOne of the most eye-catching features is GitHub Copilot\u2019s ability to use a prompt to generate code that can either be entirely new, or based on the project\u2019s existing codebase by suggesting entire blocks of code or auto-completing lines as you type them. GitHub states that the model has been trained using source code from publicly available code repositories, including public repositories on GitHub itself, and claims that GitHub Copilot can support any language that appears in a public repository.\nHowever, GitHub does mention that the quality of the suggestions GitHub Copilot can offer is dependent on the diversity and volume of the training data available for that language. This could mean that while GitHub Copilot will still try to assist developers with suggestions when working in more obscure or less used programming languages, the benefits developers may gain when using GitHub Copilot may be reduced compared languages that are more common and publicly visible.\nSubscriptions to GitHub Copilot are available today at 3 different feature levels and price points tailored to individual developers, small to large businesses, and Enterprises. If you\u2019d like to try before you buy, GitHub Copilot offers a 30 day free trial to the \u201cIndividual\u201d subscription tier.\nBest value LLM\n3. Meta LLama\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGiven Meta is included as one of the \u201cBig Five\u201d global tech firms, it should come as no surprise that they\u2019ve been working on their own LLM to support their products, large and small businesses, and other applications such as research and academics. The original version of Llama released in February 2023, but was only made available on a case by case basis to select groups within academia, governmental departments, and for research purposes. Llama 2, released in July 2023, and Llama 3, released in April 2024, are both available for general and commercial usage today.\nThe most attractive selling point for Llama 3 is how cost efficient the LLM is compared to others on the market. While it might not be quite as capable as the behemoth that is GPT-4o (though still quite comparable), it is still a very capable model that can match the performance of GPT-4 at a fraction of the cost.\nDepending on provider, Llama 3 costs an average of $0.90 per 1 million output tokens which is considerably cheaper compared to GPT-4 and GPT-4o, which sit at $30 and $15 respectively for the same quantity of tokens. This can make Llama 3 a very cost-effective solution for those who need to process a high volume of tokens and desire a high quality output, but have a limited budget.\nFrom its own internal testing, Meta has claimed that Llama 3 can also match Google Gemini and Claude 3 (though it\u2019s currently unclear how it stacks up against the recent Claude 3.5 Sonnet release) in most benchmarks, making the value proposition from Meta increasingly attractive when combined with how much it costs to use.\nIn addition to the significant cost reduction achieved, with LLaMA 3 is also open-source, allowing users to sign up to gain access to each of the different sized models, download them, and install them on their local systems or infrastructure instead of relying on cloud-based offerings from providers such as AWS or Azure.\nThis a considerable difference to many of the other popular models on the market which require you to exclusively utilize their services to make use of the models. The 8B (8 Billion parameter) version of Llama 3 is small enough that you could comfortably run it on a modern high end desktop, though you will need a large amount of RAM and GPU VRAM to make best use of it, though you do need considerably more for the larger 70B model. This essentially allows you to use the model for \u201cfree\u201d, aside from any initial hardware setup costs, which could be very useful to individuals, students and academics.\nAdditionally, those who may have concerns about privacy can avoid the potential risks commonly associated with sending data into the cloud for processing by hosting Llama 3 on local hardware, or owned infrastructure. Naturally the hardware you have available does factor into the overall performance of Llama 3 compared to using a cloud solution offered by providers such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS, but if your main goal is to keep your costs as low as possible, the performance sacrifice may be worth it.\nWhile the 8B and 70B Llama 3 models are highly capable, Meta is also working on a gigantic 400B version that Meta\u2019s Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun claims will become one of the most capable LLMs in the world once released.\nBest LLM for business\n4. Claude\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in March 2024, Claude 3 is the latest version of Anthropic\u2019s Claude LLM that further builds on the Claude 2 model released in July 2023. Claude 3 has 3 separate versions, Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus, each with a different level of capability and cost to use. Claude 3 Opus is the highest level and most capable version of Claude 3 that Anthropic claims has set new industry benchmarks across a range of cognitive tasks and has a higher capacity for reasoning that other models on the market today.\nOne of the areas in which Claude 3 excels is the size of the context window which helps to improve the context of responses based on the conversation history. While the original release of Claude was limited to a 100,000 token context window, both Claude 2 and 3 have an expanded context window of up to 200,000 tokens.\nIn real terms, this translates to roughly 500 pages of text, or approximately 150,000 words. For comparison, the standard context limit for GPT-4 is 32K tokens, and both GPT-4o and Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro are limited to 128K tokens. There are several business cases where this large input limit can provide significant gains, such as identifying trends within a large dataset, summarization of long form answers from customer satisfaction surveys, screening job applications based on a given criteria, and helping to iterate upon an idea or design being discussed with Claude 3.\nAs well as its ability to process large datasets, Anthropic claims that Claude 3 Opus, the most expensive tier of Claude 3, is the most intelligent model on the market today, and can has demonstrated some level of awareness based on the tasks given to it. During testing, Alex Albert, one of Anthropic\u2019s prompt engineers, gave Claude 3 Opus a task similar to finding a needle in a haystack by asking it to locate a specific sentence hidden inside a random collection of documents.\nNot only was the model able to find the \u201cneedle\u201d, but Claude 3 Opus also mentioned that the sentence appeared out of place and suggested that it was likely placed there for testing purposes. This demonstrated a surprising level of awareness not usually found within LLMs, although it remains to be seen as to whether this was something akin to true awareness, or if it simply follows the pattern of mimicking human intelligence as most LLMs attempt to do.\nThe creators of Claude, Anthropic, have a very strong foundation on alignment, aiming to Claude a better choice for businesses that are concerned not just about outputs that might damage their brand or company, but also society as a whole.\nHowever, all of this does come at a rather large cost compared to the competition. For those not looking for API access, Anthropic provides a free subscription tier that includes limited access to a chat interface at claude.ai powered by the newly released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, however all 3 models are accessible with higher usage limits by subscribing to the Pro tier.\nBest LLM for chatbots\n5. Qwen\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in February 2024, Qwen-1.5 is an LLM from Alibaba tailored that aims to match or outperform Google\u2019s Gemini and Meta\u2019s Llama models in both cost and capability. As well as a base models, Alibaba have also released a counterpart model tailored for chat scenarios as Qwen-1.5-chat\nSimilar to Llama, Qwen-1.5 is an open-source model that anyone can download for free and install on their own hardware and infrastructure. This makes Qwen-1.5 a very competitive choice for developers, especially those who have limited budgets, as the main costs with getting this model up and running are initial hardware investment and the cost to run and maintain the hardware.\nTo help support developers, Qwen-1.5 offers several different sizes of the model to fit a wide range of devices and hardware configurations. The largest and most capable version of Qwen-1.5 chat currently sits at 72B parameters, while the lightest version is as small as 0.5B. Qwen-1.5 has an input token limit of 32K (the 14B model is limited to 8K), which is a on par with GPT-4 and is significantly larger than the 4096 input token limit of Llama 2.\nAlthough it has the same input limit as GPT-4, Qwen-1.5 has the same output token limit as Google\u2019s Gemini at 8192, which is one of the higher output limits for LLMs on the market today. It should be noted that, like with other models on the market, the capabilities of the model decrease as the parameter size reduces, so keep that in mind when selecting the model size for your specific use case.\nIn benchmarks, Qwen-1.5 consistently outperforms Llama 2 in most scenarios, whilst also achieving competitive results compared to GPT-4. This further increases the attractiveness of Qwen-1.5 as it can offer near GPT-4 levels of capability at a fraction of the cost, and you can fine tune with a custom dataset to tailor the model to your specific usage needs. Plus, as you train the LLM on your own machine, you get to keep hold of your own data.\nIn a customer support scenario, this would provide you with a bot that is far more capable of understanding the issue a customer might have than the more traditional keyword or rule based chatbots commonly seen on the internet today. Qwen-1.5 would then be able to respond intelligently to customer queries based on your knowledgebase to improve first contact resolution rates and escalate more difficult or advanced issues to second line support agents.\nTo further enhance its chat capabilities, Qwen-1.5 can accept and respond in an impressive 35 languages and can offer translation services in over 150 others. Like with other LLMs, the number of tokens for inputs and outputs depend on the language being used as some have a higher token-to-character ratio.\nWhile recommending Qwen-1.5 for chatbots might seem like a bit of a curveball, its important to remember the use case you are applying this LLM to. In the case of a customer support bot, you probably don\u2019t need advanced intelligence allowing users to have the long philosophical conversations that you might with something like GPT-4o as its way out of scope for what you intend to use it for.\nQwen-1.5-7B-chat is available for use today via a web interface over at huggingface.co, while the larger models can be downloaded to run locally.\nBest multimodal LLM\n6. GPT-4o\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOpenAI is one of the most recognisable names when it comes to LLMs and is widely known for several models and products released over the last few years, including DALL-E for image generation, and ChatGPT, a chatbot based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\nReleased in May 2024, GPT-4o is the latest offering from OpenAI that extends the multimodal capabilities of GPT-4 Turbo by adding full integration for text, image and audio prompts, while further reducing the cost to users, making it an attractive option for those looking to for a language model that can fill multiple roles. OpenAI claims GPT-4o is twice as fast, half the cost, and has five times the rate limit compared to GPT-4 Turbo.\nOne of most significant enhancements in GPT-4o is Voice Mode, which allows the model to process audio in real time, and output a realistic, tone appropriate response in human sounding voice that might make you question if you are speaking to a real person. The human voice output is certainly impressive when compared to most of the text to speech applications currently on the market and does a fantastic job of imitating how a person might speak in real life by adding inflections and nuances normally heard in regular conversation.\nAdditionally, GPT-4o can utilise a camera to analyze the environment around you to help add context to the responses given. OpenAI demonstrated the Audio Mode and Vision features in a video alongside the release announcement for GPT-4o, however these features are not yet fully available for general usage.\nFull text integration in GPT-4o adds incremental improvements to evaluation and reasoning compared to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo and offers live translation into 50 different languages. Like with Audio Mode, GPT-4o further improves the ability to recognise context and sentiment from text inputs, and provide accurate summarizations, allowing responses to be more accurate and be presented in the appropriate tone. As with previous versions of GPT, GPT-4o can store and refer to historic conversations and look them up in real time to lend further context to responses.\nOpenAI is already rolling out the text and image features of GPT-4o to ChatGPT. In a first for OpenAI, those using the free tier of ChatGPT will have access to GPT-4o, although in a limited capacity that resets daily, which is a fantastic step given GPT-4 required a paid subscription to use when it launched. Plus subscribers users will have access to message limits up to 5 times higher than before, and an alpha version of Voice Mode will be made available to Plus users in the coming weeks.\nAPI access to the new text and image capabilities of GPT-4o is available for developers to use today, while the new audio and video capabilities will be made available in the API to a select group of partners ahead of a full rollout to the wider audience, however there\u2019s no current announcement for a specific date as to when the new voice and video capabilities will be made available.\nBest LLM for translation\n7. Google Gemini\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in February 2024, Gemini 1.5 is an updated version of the original Gemini LLM released in December 2023 that offers improved capabilities and performance compared to the original. As of May 2024, there are 2 versions of Gemini 1.5 available to subscribers \u2013 Pro and Flash.\nWhile Gemini doesn\u2019t appear to directly translate text itself, the translations provided are a combination of the translations provided by Google Translate, the multilingual training data Gemini has access to, and the LLM capabilities of Gemini, to produce a more fluent and natural sounding output.\nThis results in translations that flow better, make more contextual sense, and are less awkward than the more literal translations typically offered by Google Translate on its own, resulting in a much better overall translation. This combined approach means that Gemini 1.5 can be used to translate any language currently available via Google Translate, however the level to which Gemini 1.5 is able to enhance the output to improve how fluent and natural sounding it is does depend on the level of multilingual training data available to the model for each individual language \u2013 though this is a similar limitation that other LLMs also have.\nWhile other LLMs, such as and GPT-4o, also provide some translation capabilities, one of the key areas that Gemini 1.5 has an advantage is cost. Costs can quickly mount up if large quantities of text need to be translated, so being able to translate quickly and cheaply is an incredibly important factor. While GPT-4o has demonstrated some impressive translation capabilities of its own, also costs $15 per 1 million output tokens for text output.\nBy comparison, Gemini 1.5 costs only $2 per 1 million, which is significantly cheaper. An important thing to note when translating large quantities of text is that while Gemini 1.5 can accept up to 1 million input tokens at a time, output is currently limited to only 8192 tokens. The number of tokens required for an output will heavily depend on the target language for the translation, with some languages having higher token-to-character ratios than others.\nExceeding this limit can result in error messages, or truncation that leaves your translation incomplete. To obtain translations that require an output larger than the token limit, you\u2019ll need to break down your requests into smaller chunks. While 8192 tokens per response might seem quite low when considering it equates to around 6000 words, GPT-4o is currently limited to 2048 output tokens per response.\nGemini 1.5 Pro is free to use with some limitations, though a subscription is required for access to the increased 1m input token limit and higher rate limits.\nHow to choose the best Large Language Model\nEssentially it comes down to bang for buck. ChatGPT-4o is brilliant and can do pretty much what all the others can but at a cost. Claude 3, while not trained specifically for coding like Copilot also has a good reputation for creating code. Another thing to consider is access to your data and who owns what. You can train your own chatbot with OpenAI by creating an assistant but at the end of the day that stays with OpenAI. If you use an open model you can keep hold of your data and completely own your own trained model.\nBest Large Language Model FAQs\nWhat are Token limits?\nToken limits are a restriction LLMs have based on the number of tokens they are able to process in a single interaction. Without limits, or by having limits too large, the performance of an LLM can be affected, resulting in slow response times. However, if the limit is set too low then the LLM may struggle to generate the desired output. If an output limit is exceeded, the LLM may truncate an output, leaving it incomplete, attempt to reduce the size of the output by providing a less detailed output, or could simply generate an error. Some LLMs have the ability to segment responses to overcome output limits, but this isn\u2019t a universal feature for all LLMs.\nWhat is a rate limit?\nA rate limit is the number of requests that a user can make over a given period of time, often in minutes, hours or days. Rate limits are usually imposed by providers to help reduce the load on infrastructure so they can continue to provide an optimal service level. Rate limits are usually defined within the subscription tier for each product, with more expensive tiers offering increased rate limits.\nRate limits for your chosen LLM will vary depending on the provider, so consult their pricing sheets to determine which tier offers the best value for your needs.\nHow to use a local LLM / Open source LLM\nUnlike providers such as OpenAI and Google which use subscriptions to provide access to their LLMs, and are hosted on their own infrastructure, individuals and enterprises can download open source LLMs and deploy them to their own infrastructure.\nUsers have the option to deploy the model to existing hardware they already own, or purchase cloud compute or VPS instances to provide increased performance if greater capability is required.\nFor enterprises, this can present a cost effective way of incorporating an LLM into their business, while keeping costs lower and reducing privacy and data security concerns by keeping information in house rather than submitting it to a third party.\nWhat are tokens?\nLLMs don't break up language into individual words. Instead, they break language into chunks of text. These chunks can be individual characters or phrases of multiple words . These chunks of text are called tokens.\nWhen you use an LLM through an API you are paying for the amount of tokens used. For multimodal LLMs it's slightly different. The amount of effort to take an image as an input is converted to an amount of tokens. So, while it is not measuring tokens, you are still charged tokens.\nSo, tokens can be seen as a unit of currency exchanged for work done by an LLM and also a unit representing an amount of text. The general rule to estimate how many tokens a prompt will use is 1 token = 4 characters. For example, \u201cMay the force be with you\u201d contains 25 characters and would require ~6 tokens. However, this is only an estimate, and using inputs in other languages could require more tokens for the same input.\nYou\u2019ll need to consult the documentation of your LLM of choice to learn more about how their specific Tokenizer works.\nWhat is an LLM?\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is form of artificial intelligence trained using massive sets of data to allow the model to recognize and generate text across a wide range of tasks. LLMs are build upon machine learning concepts using a type of neural network known as a Transformer Model.\nMore advanced LLMs are also capable of accepting and outputting images, videos and audio as inputs for the model to recognize. These models are known as a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)\nHow we tested the best LLMs\nTo test for the best LLMs we first set up an account with the relevant platform, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each LLM to see how useful its basic features were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced options.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "The biggest heist of all time involved over $14 billion of crypto being stolen - and it went undetected for five years\nFive years of silence before exposure\n- LuBian\u2019s weak encryption gave a hacker complete access to 127,000 Bitcoins without alert\n- A gaming PC and time were all the hacker needed to breach crypto's \u201csafest\u201d platform\n- Over 5,000 wallets compromised and no alarms triggered as billions silently vanished\nWhat began as a silent infiltration into one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency mining pools has now been confirmed as the biggest crypto theft in history.\nThe LuBian mining pool, once a dominant force in the Bitcoin network, quietly lost over 127,000 Bitcoins in 2020.\nThe breach was only uncovered in 2025 by Arkham Intelligence, revealing a staggering $14.5 billion worth of stolen assets that had remained untouched and undetected for half a decade.\nA historic breach hidden in plain sight\nThe scale of this theft eclipses even the infamous Mt. Gox incidents of the early 2010s, as while Mt. Gox saw a higher number of Bitcoins disappear, the significantly lower value of Bitcoin at the time made the financial loss far smaller in comparison.\nBy contrast, the LuBian hack, valued at around $3.5 billion when it occurred, has since ballooned to $14.5 billion due to the rise in Bitcoin prices.\nDespite the passage of time, the hacker has held onto all the stolen funds, with no signs of large-scale laundering or spending.\nArkham\u2019s investigation suggests that the LuBian breach likely exploited a fundamental weakness in the platform\u2019s security architecture.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nIts private key generation reportedly relied on only 32 bits of entropy, a dangerously low standard by cryptographic norms, and which allowed the attacker to deploy brute-force attacks with nothing more than a gaming PC and patience.\nThe implication is critical digital assets were being guarded with the digital equivalent of a paper lock.\nThe hacker, who reportedly compromised over 5,000 wallets, used the vulnerability to access and siphon nearly all of LuBian\u2019s Bitcoin holdings.\nThe mining pool itself disappeared from the network in 2021, only a few months after the theft.\nLuBian had once boasted of being the \u201csafest high-yielding mining pool,\u201d a claim now overshadowed by its catastrophic collapse.\nThis incident calls attention to the broader issue of cyber hygiene within crypto infrastructure.\nThe use of comprehensive security suites, robust encryption methods, and advanced firewall protections should be non-negotiable - yet even among top-tier players, critical oversights remain alarmingly common.\nThe lack of transparency around the breach until 2025 also raises questions about how many similar attacks may have gone unnoticed.\nThe hacker has now been arrested, but the LuBian case is a reminder of the consequences of weak digital security.\nIt also shows how easily identity theft and systemic failures can converge in the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrency.\nVia Toms Hardware\nYou might also like\n- These are the best Android antivirus apps around today\n- Here is our guide to the best malware removal tools around\n- What is cloud repatriation and why it may become the hottest term in 2026\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "Encouraging AI uptake: people first, tech second\nIf value and purpose aren\u2019t defined then AI adoption will likely fail\nThe recent announcement that Google is embedding a new AI mode into its search engine is yet another example of our daily exposure to AI. In theory, almost everything could be automated if we really wanted it to be, but getting the most out of AI tools within a workplace setting will always come down to thinking strategically.\nWhat is the value it will create and how will it impact people? That\u2019s not just employees or users, but partners and ultimately customers. If the value and purpose aren\u2019t defined \u2013 and the roadmap to achieve success is unclear \u2013 then AI adoption is likely to fail.\nHead of Digitalisation, Marketing and Entrepreneurship at Henley Business School.\nFrom appetite to adoption\nIn a recent survey we carried out with over 4,000 UK workers, we found that the appetite to use AI within the workplace is there, with more than half of respondents (56%) feeling optimistic about the benefits. But when it comes to getting the most out of it, workers were less positive. 61% admitted to being overwhelmed by the rapid pace of AI advancements and that the sheer number of tools available make it difficult to know where to start (24%).\nSo how can the gap be bridged to ensure AI enhances workers\u2019 lives and is used strategically? Although the pace of AI advancement is rapid, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to throw best practice out of the window and adopt it without due diligence or thorough assessment. Knowing what to automate, and equally what not to automate, is about assessing the risk, setting objectives and putting measurable performance indicators in place. Only by having a clear goal for AI can businesses bring stakeholders along on the journey and achieve real value.\nReducing risk\nAdopting AI brings different levels of risk \u2013 from operational to reputational. Without clear guidance for usage or contingency for failure, day-to-day business operations can be negatively impacted. Reputational risk and preservation of value must also be considered when looking to automate certain processes. For example, what experience do you want people to have when interacting with your business? What value do you want to create? What risks are you going to take, if something goes wrong, and how resilient is your business against these risks?\nAnd what would you lose as a result of automation? It\u2019s harder to define what shouldn\u2019t be automated but it\u2019s just as important as knowing what should. It requires reflection on what a business does and what it values. AI shouldn\u2019t be about humans being replaced by machines but about how AI technology can be used effectively, to augment processes and support people to do their best work.\nTied in with assessing risk is ensuring responsible usage of AI. The OECD AI principles promote the use of AI that is innovative and trustworthy and respects human rights and democratic values, with an emphasis on human-centered values. By following these principles, organizations can not only adopt AI responsibly but have a basis on which to create clear guidelines for employee usage and expectations.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nTransparency and trust\nSetting a clear strategy and defining the right role for AI is not enough. The right culture needs to be created and any plans communicated effectively to those it will impact, to allay any anxiety around usage. AI comes with many connotations and preconceptions, so it\u2019s important for organizations to remove fear of the unknown.\nThis can be done by creating a safe environment for people to explore what AI can do, with the support of clear guidelines on what tools are available to them. This will give users the confidence to use AI in their roles and remove any misalignment between perception and reality.\nDedicated AI training and guidance are crucial for the success of any initiatives. This is backed up by our survey in which a quarter (24%) of UK workers cited that a lack of training makes it hard to use AI effectively at work. Almost a half (49%) said their employer has no guidelines at all for using AI. When asked how inclined they would be to use or use AI more in the workplace if provided with training, the majority (60%) said they would be more inclined.\nThis suggests that many workplaces still lack positive facilitating conditions for AI usage, which could be leading workers to feel overwhelmed and under-supported when it comes to using AI tools within their role. Creating a culture of openness around AI usage will help build transparency and trust for users and ensure they can get value from it. Providing an environment for sharing experiences \u2013 positive and negative \u2013 will further support adoption. As not every organization has an \u2018AI expert\u2019, sharing these experiences will support best-practice creation and adoption across the organization.\nLeading from the top down\nLike with any new technology adoption, there will be short and long term value. ROI will not always be immediate. As such it\u2019s important to effectively manage change and expectations. Any type of business transformation will create different ways of working and a period of adjustment, which can take time for users to adapt to.\nIt is therefore important that AI adoption initiatives are driven from the top, with senior managers providing clarity for users. Leaders need to make sure people understand the strategy behind the introduction of AI, the ultimate goal, and how AI supports it. This will help reduce uncertainties and fear of the unknown, and ensure both the business and users achieve value. Only through creating a culture of transparency, trust and continuous learning can AI augment workers\u2019 lives rather than overwhelm.\nWe've featured the best productivity tool.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices.

It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests.

Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions.

Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams.

Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords. It scans the entire page, or even your whole workspace, to understand what matters. Then it delivers a clear, relevant answer.\nYou can even narrow that search to a specific doc, database, or tagged goal using @mentions. It also pulls content from connected tools like Google Drive or Slack and adds citations when needed.\n\u2705 You already use Notion as your main workspace: Notion AI is built into the tools you\u2019re already using, from notes to docs to calendars.\n\u2705 You want an all-in-one AI assistant: It handles writing, editing, summarizing, translating, and even extracting data from other tools.\n\u2705 You need workspace-level search: Ask it to find updates, draft pages, or summarize anything across your workspace.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Notion at all: It only works inside Notion, so it won\u2019t help with external docs or tools unless integrated.\n\u274c You need a perfect structure every time: Some summaries or tables need edits to match your format or tone.\nThere\u2019s also an AI Chat that works like a workspace-wide command center. It runs on GPT\u20114 and Claude to help with prompts or planning. I asked for a 5K training schedule and got a full week-by-week plan with toggles.\nIf you're not sure where to begin, the Notion templates gallery is worth checking out. It comes with a bunch of pre-built layouts for everything from meeting notes and study planners to editorial calendars and startup CRMs. You can add a template, then ask AI to help you populate or personalize it instantly.\nSome features still need polishing. The study tools often require manual edits, and summaries may lose detail unless you specify it to keep the original phrasing.\nBest AI assistant for Notion users who want writing, search, and task help\nNotion brings AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude straight into your Notion docs, making it perfect for summarizing, brainstorming, writing, and workspace querying. It helps you clean up text, generate tasks, build custom dashboards, or auto-fill databases. A free trial is available in all accounts.

Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage.\nFor instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots .

Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2.

In our opinion, you\u2019ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft\u2019s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time.\nMicrosoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite. This helps businesses to integrate translation capabilities into their applications, call centers, and multilingual conversational agents, all of which help in smooth and efficient communication with global customers.\nDuring our test, we used a feature called \"Live Transcribe\" that can transcribe speech in real time. This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4.

It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

This includes identifying the main use cases and features we expect the tool to deliver, such as data analysis, automation, or customer support.\nOur team then conducts hands-on testing by running real-world scenarios to test the AI tool's performance. Like for testing a data analysis tool, we use different datasets to check the accuracy and efficiency of a tool. This helps us assess how well the tool meets our requirements under different conditions.\nIntegration capabilities are a big deal for us which is why we examine how easy it is to incorporate an AI tool into our existing systems. We test the compatibility with common software platforms to ensure smooth integration while noting any technical issues or complications during the process.\nNext, user experience is another important aspect for our testing. We explore the AI tool's interface by collecting feedback from our team members who\u2019ve already used the tool. This helps us determine if the tool is easy to use and user-friendly.\nConsidering the significance of safety and privacy, we test the AI tool's compliance with industry standards and regulations like GDPR. We ensure it uses encryption and other security measures to protect user data, paying special attention to how it handles sensitive information.\nTo complete our testing, we evaluate the support and community of the AI tool. We reach out to dedicated customer support with questions and note how responsive they are. We also check user forums and online reviews to calculate the level of community involvement, which gives us insights into common issues and solutions.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best AI writer of 2025\nQuickly generate text\nWe list the best AI writers, to make it simple and easy to create simple automated text content.\nThe word \"AI\" has been named the word of the year. ChatGPT has made waves since its introduction in late 2022. With every new iteration of this powerful tool, users have found innovative ways to use it to simplify and speed up their work.\nNow, there are many AI writing assistants on the market, competing with ChatGPT to become the king of AI-powered writing tools. These new tools aim to simplify the writing process by generating long-form content, researching keywords, creating images from text, and more.\nHowever, be warned that a lot of tools that market themselves as \"Ai writers\" are nothing more than scripts for auto-generating text, which means the quality is so poor you'll probably having to spend more on human writer/editors to correct it.\nAdditionally, AI-generated content may also lack the unique voice and style a human writer can provide and the content generated may require additional editing to ensure it's polished. On top of all this there is the constant danger of any information within the text being inaccurate.\nIn spite of all these concerns, some businesses think there are benefits of using AI writers, such as cost and time savings. These are usually businesses more focused on producing quantity rather than quality, and so are probably using AI writers to replace existing automated text generation scripts.\nAlso be warned that AI writers may not yet good enough to help with creative content and are still effectively autogenerating or replacing text based on set rules, which means text they create can read as artificial, and edits they make can sometimes seem senseless.\nIf you're interested in trying one of these tools, below we've listed the best AI writers on the market.\nYour AI Writing Assistant, Built-In. Draft, Refine, and Create with Gemini in Google Docs & Gmail. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nThe best AI writers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest AI writer overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You also need a grammar editor: Getting help from an AI writer is even better with one that also helps you with grammar, like Grammarly.\n\u2714\ufe0f Need to use it across multiple apps: With Grammarly installed on your computer, you instantly gain access to it across your favorite apps like Microsoft Word and other word processing packages.\n\u2714\ufe0f Want something that's easy to use \u2014 once you learn how to do it: Once you understand how GrammarlyGO works, it's going to make your life easier and assist you in making your text better.\n\u274c You're on a strict budget: No doubt, Grammarly itself is expensive, especially if you only want to pay for it on a month-to-month basis.\n\u274c You don't need a grammar tool: Maybe this is overkill, depending on your situation.\n\u274c You need social networking-specific tools: GrammarlyGO doesn't offer these types of tools, at least for now.\nGrammarly stands as a user-friendly writing companion, offering a wealth of features to enhance your content. Perfect for students, professionals, and writers.\nCheck out our in-depth Grammarly review for a closer look at the service, and see why it's our top AI writing pick.\nThe growing demand for writing tools underscores the need for efficient and reliable solutions. Enter Grammarly, a long-standing player in the market, designed to elevate written communication. It offers a suite of powerful features including grammar and spell-checking, style suggestions, tone adjustments, and clarity enhancements. We recommend the tool to anyone who is seeking an extra hand in their writing journey.\nGrammarly can be integrated into various writing platforms, including web browsers, MS Word, Google Docs, and more. In fact, this is a more popular choice as Grammarly provides real-time feedback on documents. Once integrated as an extension, you can use Grammarly to edit pretty much anything you write. But, it is worth noting that the Free version of the extension is quite limited and only provides suggestions for grammar.\nGrammarly is also available as a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices and is free to download. The Grammarly keyboard integrates with mobile apps including Outlook, Gmail, and Instagram to name a few, and allows users to access the Grammarly writing assistance on the go.\nGrammarly caters to all writing needs including grammar checking, style suggestions, and readability analysis. However, if you want to get the most out of the tool, you will have to upgrade to Premium or Business version of the tool as the Free version is quite limited and only tracks grammar errors. Overall, our experience using Grammarly was positive and we found the interface to be user-friendly plus the real-time feedback was an added bonus.\nPlease read our full GrammarlyGo review.\nBest AI writer for marketing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You are a marketer: Anyword is the best AI writer for marketers on the planet.

It's flexible.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need marketing-based tools: Offers SEO optimization, content in bulk, and more.\n\u274c You don't want to self-edit: Articleforge may require more post-generation editing than other options, which could slow you down.\n\u274c You don't want to deal with duplicates: Yes, sometimes Articleforge repeats suggestions.\n\u274c If you don't want to spend more for a monthly subscription: It's cheaper to buy this on a yearly basis, and that might not be a commitment you're willing to make.\nArticleforge utilizes basic text generation to improve content over time, though heavy editing and fact-checking are often necessary.\nCheck out our in-depth Articleforge review for more information.\nArticleforge is a tool that can greatly help speed up the text-generation process for users for people more focused on creating quantity over quality. However, it is important to note that it is not a replacement for an experienced writer or editor. While it can provide recommendations for titles and automate SEO and WordPress publishing, it is not designed to produce ready-to-publish content.\nOne of the benefits of Articleforge is that it is available in seven languages, making it ideal for international blogs or multi-language sites. Users simply need to enter a few keywords and the topic they want to cover, and the platform will generate content in under 60 seconds. This auto-generated content will use the provided keywords and cover the desired topic.\nIn addition to its quick and easy content generation, Articleforge also offers various integrations, including MS Word and WordPress integrations. The platform also provides integrations with other software systems like SEO AutoPilot, CyberSEO, RankerX, SEnuke TNG, and more. These integrations are easy to use, thanks to the API key offered by the platform.\nWhile the platform is a convenient tool for creating content, its output quality falls short of expectations. As with any automated system, fact-checking is necessary for the majority of the content offered by the platform. The platform does offer better output quality with customized input. However, extensive testing is required, which can quickly exhaust the \"word meter.\"\nHowever, be warned that if you're hoping to be able to generate spam content to flood Google Search with then be warned that you're well over a decade too late, as Google implemented natural language analysis and processing to filter out junk into their algorithm a very long time ago.\nOverall, it is advisable to test it out and find a balance between the platform and tailored input to yield superior results. While it should not be relied upon as a sole source of content, using it in conjunction with other resources can help users quickly generate usable content.\nRead our full Articleforge AI writer review.\nBest AI writer for long-form writing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a great plagiarism checker: You want to create original content, right? This checker makes sure that's true.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need to create content in multiple languages: Some folks are writing content in multiple languages and Jasper lets you do this.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want access to a lot of features: The team behind this solution tends to add new features on a regular basis without raising the price. That's sweet.\n\u274c You don't have time to learn: Any AI writer takes time to learn. Jasper takes a little bit more time.\n\u274c If you don't want to spend a lot: Some folks might not feel the Creator package is enough and the next one is expensive.\n\u274c If you aren't willing to edit a lot: Some of the content Jasper creates is better than others. Some extra editing is key.\nJasper is a platform that is highly customizable and comes with a user-friendly interface. All the necessary tools that you need are just a click away.

This feature is incredibly useful for writers who need to create a large volume of content in a short amount of time. However, of course, by increasing speed you reduce quality, and the material produced may be easily flagged as autogenerated.\nIn the Boss Mode, you can also use pre-built recipes offered by the Jasper team such as \u201cWrite about (keyword),\u201d but you also have the option of creating your own, which can be incredibly helpful if you have specific requirements for your content.\nRead our full Jasper review.\nBest free AI writer\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a free plan for minor work: If you're okay with only generating 2,000 words per month, there's a free plan for that.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need unlimited word generation: You can create unlimited words each month with all the paid plans.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want multiple tools: New features are added often, making the product even better.\n\u274c You are a marketer: There are better options if you primarily need to write marketing copy.\n\u274c You aren't willing to learn: Here's another option that is a little bit harder to learn, at least initially.\n\u274c You need app integration: Expect to stay on the CopyAI website to get your work done, which requires copy and paste.\nCopyAI helps writers create high-quality copy with the power of AI, saving time\nCheck out our in-depth CopyAI review to see whether it's the tool for you.\nCopyAI offers a wide range of options that allow users to get started, from exploring various writing templates, settings, and features on the user dashboard to creating a compelling copy in minutes.\nThe user dashboard serves as the creative command center for CopyAI users, providing a user-friendly and intuitive interface that makes it easy to navigate through different features.

That's true with the Smart Team options\n\u274c You need more third-party integrations: It doesn't really place nice with other software tools, which could add some time to your work.\n\u274c You don't like tackling a learning curve: Like others on this list, there's a slighter higher learning curve with this one\nWritesonic is an expansive AI writing platform with an intuitive interface and versatile templates for all content creation scenarios.\nCheck out our in-depth Writesonic review to see if this is the AI writing tool for you.\nWritesonic is a content creation platform that provides users with various features and tools to generate content. One of the most impressive features of Writesonic is its versatility - it supports over 25 languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Chinese, and more. This is a significant advantage for businesses that operate in multiple regions and need to produce content in different languages. However, as usual, ensure you have editors who are fluent in these languages to avoid embarrassing mistakes.\nAnother notable feature of Writesonic is its tone of voice customization tool. Users can choose from various tones, including \"Excited,\" \"Creative,\" and more. This feature adds a unique twist to the content. However, it's essential to note that the tone of voice feature may require additional editing to ensure the content is clear and coherent. Additionally, also be warned that when writing for non-English markets there may be different limits of acceptability when it comes to tone, and to avoid informal use of terms.\nRegarding website copywriting, Writesonic provides users with an impressive range of tools. It can create pages, meta descriptions, headers and subheaders. Additionally, it allows users to create social media ads on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google though again, you should ensure these ads are proof-checked by a human editor to avoid risking losing money due to errors. Content creators can also benefit from Writesonic's blog writing, point expansion, and text analysis tools, which can rephrase the content and improve its readability.\nThe platform also offers e-commerce copy creation and popular copywriting formulas, such as the \"AIDA\" and \"Pain-Agitate-Solution\" formulas.\nHowever, it's essential to note that the content generated by Writesonic may require significant editing from the user. While the platform does an excellent job of generating content, it's essential to ensure it's clear, coherent, and tailored to the user's needs. If you're looking for a completely hands-off approach to content creation, Writesonic may not be the best option. However, for businesses that need to generate high-quality, engaging content quickly, Writesonic is an excellent choice to start with before using human writers and editors to clean things up.\nPlease read our full Writesonic review.\nBest AI writer for sourcing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a cheap package: You can get an AI writer for as little as $19/month.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need clear sourcing: No better solution is available for providing sources for all text provided.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an easy solution: A very low learning curve exists.\n\u274c You want app integration: There's seamless integration with WordPress, but that's about it.\n\u274c You need marketing-specific tools: Sorry, this one doesn't have it.\n\u274c You want unlimited word generation: If you need to generate more than 120 articles per month, this is a very expensive solution.\nAI-Writer is a unique word-generating tool that simplifies text creation and editing through an intuitive user interface. However, it may not be suitable for everyone.\nCheck out our in-depth AI-Writer review to see if it's the solution for you.\nAI-Writer is a word generator that is easily accessible and is popular among freelancers and bloggers. It may not be as extensive as Anyword or CopyAI, which are primarily aimed at marketing and sales, but it serves its intended audience well.\nOne of the most significant advantages of AI-Writer is its unparalleled sourcing capabilities. It is the only AI content generator that cites sources for \"everything it writes.\" Additionally, it updates its sources frequently, ensuring that any article generated by it sources the latest information on the subject. This is a significant advantage, particularly for those who are writing about current events or trending topics. With AI-Writer, writers can create content that is well-researched and accurate, without having to spend hours scouring the internet for sources.\nAnother significant advantage of AI-Writer is that it recognizes that not all types of content require sourcing. For instance, op-eds or personal essays don't usually require sources. AI-Writer recognizes this and hides sources and links from the main results page, making it easier for writers to focus on editing or rewriting content and not worry about sources, though arguably if looking to write professionally that's not a good habit to get into.\nOne of the drawbacks of using AI-Writer is that its extensive sourcing process can cause a minor delay in generating results compared to other AI writing tools. Although this may not be a significant issue, the noticeable delay should be mentioned. For instance, alternative tools like GrammarlyGO offer results without hesitation. However, it is worth noting that the issue with AI-Writer is primarily due to its thorough sourcing process.\nIn conclusion, AI-Writer is an excellent tool for people new to writing who want to create content quickly. It excels in sourcing capabilities, making it a go-to tool for writers who need well-researched and accurate content. While it may not be the fastest tool on the market, its thorough sourcing process is worth the wait.\nRead our full AI-Writer review.\nTechRadar's AI writer rankings\nNumerous AI writing solutions are already available in the market, and we can expect more to arrive in the future.

From data-driven, high-value pieces to conversion-focused content perfect for marketing campaigns, AI writers can easily create just about any content.\nAs AI writing assistants gain exposure to various forms of real-world information, they gain proficiency in generating natural-sounding output. With their data coming from human sources, the output created also has a human-like quality. Much like how humans rely on existing content to craft something new, AI content tools scour the web for relevant data to fulfill the user's instructions, thus creating original content.\nThis, in a nutshell, explains what AI writing is and how it functions.\nHow to choose the best AI writer for you?\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way. Whichever platform you choose, you will have to do some editing, if you want to create useful texts.\nHere are some of the factors you should consider when choosing the right tool for you:\n1. Ease of use\nTools that don\u2019t require technical knowledge or prior experience should be on the top of your list. Investment in good UI means that other aspects of the tool are also likely to be of a higher quality.\n2. Price\nWhile this may not be popular with everyone, the price should play a major role in deciding which tool to go for. Some are simply overpriced while not offering much more than their lower-priced competition. Pay attention to the amount of content each price plan offers.\n3. High-quality output\nDespite the fact that, in the end, you will be editing the texts and images the tool creates, having a tool that creates high-quality content will mean less time spent on fixing mistakes and editing.\n4. Integrations\nIf you\u2019re running a blog or business and have been doing so for some time, you probably have your set of tools that you use for writing content. Making sure that the new AI platform syncs well with your existing toolbox can be essential for how long and how well you utilize the AI tool.\nThe list above is not exhaustive, but does offer a great starting point in your quest to find the best AI writing tool for your needs.\nHow we tested the best AI writer\nDuring our assessment, we\u2019ve evaluated various aspects such as the number of writing templates, categories, recipes, number of languages supported, grammar checkers, etc. Our goal was to create an extensive list of AI writing assistants that offer much more than simple rewording features.\nWe tested the overall capabilities of the AI software, the tool's interface and ease of use, monthly article limits, SEO optimization features, and pricing, among other aspects.\nIn addition, we gave each platform a test article to write for us (a simple topic) and checked its sentence structure and content relevance.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "How business leaders can manage integration of AI\nA roadmap on integrating AI\n2023 was the breakout year of AI and since then it\u2019s been going from strength to strength. It\u2019s seen as the solution to everything from productivity and a skills gap to fixing the NHS, with Tony Blair calling for AI doctors and chatbots to \u2018save\u2019 the health service.\nThere has been an explosive growth of generative AI with most companies using it in at least one of their business functions. It\u2019s gone from being a subject discussed by tech teams to something regularly mentioned in the boardroom.\nAccording to a survey of C-suite executives, 40 percent say their companies will increase their investment in AI tools overall.\nAnd whilst there is no doubt AI is developing in accuracy, I do not believe it can replace humans in every single area and one in particular \u2013 emotional intelligence.\nFounder and CEO of DPC.\nOver-reliance on AI in business\nOver-reliance on AI in business risks removing that vital input from key decision making and team building and runs the risk of making some areas of leadership redundant \u2013 at significant cost.\nThe costs might not immediately show up on a PNL spreadsheet, but they will be felt in other areas where it might not be so easy to quantify.\nAI is a useful tool, but it's just that - a tool and it cannot replace that \u2018gut feeling\u2019 or connection that a great leader of any team has. That\u2019s the magic which turns a group of disparate people into a team \u2013 the sum of which is greater than its parts.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nMy concern is that we need to strike the right balance between our use of technology and building and developing our own skills. If all we do is put resources into AI at the expense of other training and development, or replace people with machines, we will be the worse for it.\nIn short, I worry that people will become reliant on AI and could lose that innate human element that we bring to leadership and team building.\nLeaders have understanding and insights\nLeaders have understanding and insights built over many years which cannot be replaced by data or machines. If AI cannot find the answers to a question, it can make things up. Look at the infamous court case in America which made headlines in May 2023 when a law firm, Levidow, Levidow & Oberman got caught citing fake cases generated by ChatGPT.\nThe \u2018soft skills\u2019 which good leaders at all levels have make the difference between a good leader and a great leader can\u2019t be replaced by software. These personal qualities enable people to interact effectively and successfully with others: communication, teamwork, problem-solving and adaptability \u2013 not to mention empathy.\nThese should be highly valued in the workplace, and especially by leaders, as they contribute to improved teamwork, productivity and overall job satisfaction.\nMy experience of working in elite sports has shown me that humans cannot just be replaced by technology, no matter how smart.\nAI has a role to play\nAI has a role to play in any team, particularly with more basic tasks of information gathering or data analysis, but it cannot replace the power of a human connection.\nAn emotionally intelligent leader goes beyond the numbers and knows their team. AI can\u2019t pick up that real emotional response, and it can't read people like humans do.\nIt\u2019s \u2018machine learning\u2019 for a reason \u2013 it uses whatever data you pump into it but there are just some cues and traits which cannot be quantified and that\u2019s what cannot be replaced.\nWe've used technology and data in sport for a long time; elite sports is incredibly data driven. We've got all the information that says the players should train at this point because they are due to pull a hamstring or develop another injury or over train.\nAnd whilst it's useful to have that information, it should be used as a guide.\nI've seen many top-level coaches when the sports scientists are running over, saying \u2018we need to stop training now.\u2019\nBut the coach looks at the players and can see that the players can continue for another ten minutes, and he\u2019s pushed the players through.\nThe data could also get it wrong and put players at risk by pushing them too much whereas a coach will see if his players look physically fatigued and need to stop training early.\nCosts of bad investment\nThe costs of misreading that at elite sports level go beyond the investment in a machine: we\u2019re talking millions of pounds worth of players or the opportunity to achieve a lifetime goal of a medal on the world stage.\nAnd even when Olympic golds aren\u2019t in the picture, the impact of a toxic working environment is felt not only in the lower productivity or staff turnover but in more personal impacts on someone\u2019s health and sense of value.\nThis knowledge and consequent decision making comes from the human understanding of people. In my 25 years\u2019 of working in both a team and in a leadership role in sports I have yet to see a coach who has got that wrong.\nBecause we\u2019ve used data in sports for so many years I think it provides a lesson for other areas on how we can use AI: as a way of gathering data, of making predictions or analysing patterns but only as a tool to help inform our own human-driven intelligence.\nTo rely on AI wholly would be a mistake: nothing can replace that human intelligence.\nWe've compiled a list of the best data visualization tools and the best business intelligence platforms.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.
