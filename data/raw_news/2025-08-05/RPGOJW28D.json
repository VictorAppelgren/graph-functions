  "description": "Buying a stock is easy, but buying the right one without a tested strategy is incredibly hard.",
  "content": "Buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a time-tested strategy is incredibly hard. So what are the best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist? Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Rollins (ROL) are prime candidates.\n\nThe market confounded expectations for difficulties and turned in an outstanding performance in 2023 and 2024. Donald Trump's election victory initially boosted stocks, but they then got walloped due to the Trump administration's tariff agenda. The market is back near highs, however, as Trump has eased tariffs, at least temporarily. The Federal Reserve outlook is unclear amid elevated inflation and Trump policy uncertainty.\n\nBest Stocks To Buy: The Crucial Ingredients\n\nRemember, there are thousands of stocks trading on the NYSE and Nasdaq. But you want to find the very best stocks right now to generate massive gains.\n\nThe IBD Methodology offers clear guidelines on what you should be looking for. Invest in stocks with recent quarterly and annual earnings growth of at least 25%. Look for companies that have new, game-changing products and services. Also consider not-yet-profitable companies, often recent IPOs, that are generating tremendous revenue growth.\n\nUsing such an approach can help give you an edge over the benchmark S&P 500. Outdoing this industry benchmark is key to generating exceptional returns over the long term.\n\nIn addition, keep an eye on supply and demand for the stock itself, focus on leading stocks in top industry groups, and aim for stocks with strong institutional support.\n\nOnce you have found a stock that fits the criteria, it is then time to turn to stock charts to plot a good entry point. You should wait for a stock to form a base and then buy it once it reaches a buy point, ideally in heavy volume. In many cases, a stock reaches a proper buy point when it breaks above the original high on the left side of the base. More information on what a base is, and how charts can be used to win big on the stock market, can be found here.\n\nA key part of investing is to keep track of the market. Most stocks, even the very best, follow the market direction. Invest when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend and move to cash when the stock market goes into a correction.\n\nThe stock market turned in stunning gains in 2023 and 2024. The major indexes surged to record highs in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory, but tariff worries and a more cautious outlook from the Fed on interest rates are now weighing on stocks.\n\nThe stock market is back near highs after fighting back with aplomb after coming under considerable pressure. However indexes reversed Friday. The S&P 500 has moved above its 50-day moving average as well as its 200-day line, as has the Nasdaq composite. They were briefly forced below the short-term 21-day line, but have rallied back. Recent gains were impressive as stocks come off lows.\n\nThe current fight-back means investors should be putting money to work, though they should still be on their guard in case of another pullback in this headline-driven market. The selections below are among the best stocks to buy or watch now. The IBD 50 is also a rich hunting ground.\n\nIn addition, it is now especially crucial to stay on top of sell signals. Any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price should be jettisoned. Also beware of sharp breaks below the 50-day or 10-week moving average.\n\nThings can change quickly when it comes to the stock market. Make sure to keep a close eye on the market trend page here.\n\nBest Stocks To Buy Or Watch\n\nNow let's look at these five stocks to buy or watch. An important consideration is that these best stocks to buy and watch all boast impressive relative strength.\n\nAI stock Google has cleared the buy zone of cup-with-handle entry of 181.23, according to MarketSurge analysis.\n\nBut its recent pullback also functions as an alternate handle, which offers a higher 197.05 potential buy point.\n\nIt has rebounded well after getting support at the 50-day moving average. It managed to hold above its 21-day exponential moving average despite a broad pullback.\n\nThe relative strength line is moving higher as well, an encouraging sign. This gauges a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500.\n\nThe internet play is an excellent all-around performer, which is reflected in its very strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of 99.\n\nPrice performance is a weak spot, with Alphabet only among the top 23% of issues in terms of gains over the past 12 months. It is is now up more than 3% this year.\n\nHowever, fundamental performance is top notch, with its EPS Rating coming in at a near-perfect 97.\n\nWall Street expects more progress ahead, with profits seen rising 28% in 2025. This means it is expected to exceed the 25% growth sought by those following IBD investing principles.\n\nBig Money has been adding to holdings of the stock of late, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B-.\n\nFunds currently hold 41% of shares overall, MarketSurge data shows. This is a solid level of institutional ownership.\n\nEarnings are out of the way for the Magnificent Seven name, a plus. Q2 earnings and revenue topped estimates while internet search advertising and cloud computing revenue came in above expectations.\n\nThe Google parent is investing heavily in artificial intelligence. The firm said it expects capital spending to reach $85 billion in 2025, up from earlier guidance of $75 billion. With the updated guidance, capital spending is expected to jump 62% in 2025, up from a 43% increase.\n\n\"The step-up in capital spending is reflective of the company leaning in behind strong demand it's seeing across cloud products and services,\" said Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali in a research report.\n\nAt Evercore ISI, analyst Mark Mahaney said investors should monitor operating margins. Like Microsoft (MSFT), which recently announced job cuts, Google is using AI internally for software coding projects.\n\n\"As the company ramps capital spending, will AI-driven efficiencies support more disciplined headcount growth,?\" Mahaney said in a note to clients.\n\nThis gold stock is nearing the top of its buy zone from a cup-with-handle entry of 126.65. This could also be interpreted as a flat base. On July 21 shares crossed a trendline within the long handle, generating an aggressive buy point near 122.\n\nThe stock has been finding support at its 50-day moving average, according to MarketSurge analysis. It is now clear of its 21-day exponential moving average as well.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines stock is an excellent all-around performer, which is reflected in its IBD Composite Rating of 99.\n\nFundamental performance is currently a key strength, with the gold stock holding an Earnings Per Share Rating of 97 out of 99. In the most recent quarter sales increased 36% to $2.816 billion while adjusted earnings jumped 81% to $1.94 per share.\n\nAnalysts see further profit growth ahead though. Earnings are expected to surge 65% this year before slowing to 6% growth in 2026, MarketSurge data shows. Analysts have been revising their estimates upwards, a good sign.\n\nIt is also faring well on the technical front as it sits in the top 9% of issues in terms of price performance over the past 12 months. The stock has also rallied more than 60% so far in 2025.\n\nInstitutions have adding to their holdings of the stock lately, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B.\n\nAgnico has mines in Canada, Mexico, Finland and Australia. It has grown from a company that operated only one mine as recently as 2008, with acquisitions playing a key role in its expansion.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the gold stock. Canaccord Genuity Analyst Carey MacRury rates Agnico Eagle stock as a buy, with a price target of CA$197, or roughly $144.40. He touted the fact that the company boasts \"near-zero net debt\" and offers \"enhanced shareholder returns.\"\n\nWith gross debt reduced by around $700 million over the past 12 months and only $90 million in debt maturing over the next 12 months, MacRury wrote in an April 29 note to clients that Agnico is \"well positioned to increase share repurchases with excess free cash flow.\"\n\nCFRA Analyst Matthew Miller rates it as a strong buy with a target of CA$198, which equates to $145.13. He praised it as a \"best-in-class operator\" that has \"top-tier assets in favorable jurisdictions.\"\n\n\"The company excels in organic growth and execution. The Kirkland Lake merger brings complementary high-grade assets and expertise,\" Miller said in a June 21 research note.\n\nThe European Central Bank recently reported that gold is now the world's second-most important reserve asset for central banks, behind only the U.S. dollar. And with Goldman Sachs forecasting gold rising to $3,700 per troy ounce by the end of 2025, with an upper range of $3,880, there is apparently still room for further gains.\n\nGold often acts as hedge vs. inflation, currencies and other risks. So bullion, and gold miners, tends to swing with macroeconomic changes and sentiment.\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners? Start With These 3 Steps\n\nThe medical software play is also one of the best stocks to buy now or watch. It has formed a new flat base with a 291.69 buy point. After briefly breaking out, shares pulled back below the 21-day line. It is back above the level after getting support at the 50-day moving average.\n\nThe current pattern formed after the stock gapped up May 29 following a positive earnings report. Several weeks of sideways activity allowed the 10-week line to catch up with the stock.\n\nVEEV stock has a near-perfect IBD Composite Rating of of 97. This is a reflection of excellent all-around performance.\n\nThe RS line has come off recent highs, but an upward spike could see it quickly climb above these levels.\n\nEarnings performance is a key strength, with the stock holding an EPS Rating of 97 out of 99. Earnings have grown by an average 29% over the past three quarters \u2013 strong growth indeed.\n\nInstitutions have adding to their holdings of VEEV stock of late, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B-.\n\nThe number of firms holding shares in Veeva Systems is strong at the moment, according to MarketSurge data. In total, 55% of its stock is held by funds.\n\nThe MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) and the Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) are among the noteworthy holders.\n\nThe cloud computing company, which develops software for the life sciences, blew past fiscal first-quarter expectations at that time and gave a bullish full-year outlook. The company's forecast exceeded analysts' estimates. The company has said it's performed well despite disruptions in health care following Covid-19.\n\nVeeva recently said it has expanded its partnership with Dow Jones component Merck (MRK). The software maker is ending its relationship with another Dow Jones index name, Salesforce (CRM), in September.\n\nVeeva was a spinoff from Salesforce, and initially used the Salesforce CRM platform. Veeva built its Vault CRM application allowing it to be independent of Salesforce. The company has six commitments to its Vault CRM, including the Merck agreement and Bayer, according to an Oppenheimer Company Update on Veeva.\n\nVeeva Systems has landed a spot on the prestigious IBD 50 list. It also is on the Big Cap 20 and Tech Leaders lists. It has also won a place on the IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks.\n\nThe clothing and home decor stock is near the top of the buy zone from a cup-with-handle base entry of 74.45. This is an early-stage pattern, a plus.\n\nShares have rebounded from their 10-week line and previously broke the downtrend of the handle, which offered an early entry.\n\nThe stock's 50-day moving average is pulling away from its 200-day line, a bullish sign. The relative strength line has come off highs during the base-building phase.\n\nShares have bounced back after finding support at the 10-week line. They also got support at the 21-day line on Friday.\n\nOverall performance is top class, with its IBD Composite Rating sitting at 97 out of 99. It also sits near the top of the competitive apparel industry group.\n\nEarnings performance is its strongest suit at the moment, with its EPS Rating sitting a near-perfect 98. In addition, earnings have grown by an average of 48% over the past three quarters.\n\nProfits are seen popping 23% in the current fiscal year, before slowing to 10% growth the next, MarketSurge data shows.\n\nHowever, it is not slouch technically. It is among the top 5% of stocks in terms of price performance over the past 12 months and is up more than 41% already in 2025.\n\nInstitutions have also been loading up on the stock of late, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating sitting at B+. In total, 65% of shares are held by funds. The acclaimed Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) is among the noteworthy backers.\n\nThe company's most recent earnings report defied expectations of softer consumer trends. The retailer described customers as \"resilient\" and eager for spring fashion.\n\nApril-ended quarter sales rose 10.7% to $1.33 billion while earnings per share jumped 78.5% to $1.16. It was the second straight quarter of strong revenue gains and the third consecutive quarter of accelerating EPS growth.\n\nUrban Outfitters has more than 700 stores globally under the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters, Nuuly and other brands.\n\nMarket Tries To Steady After Sell-Off; Big Earnings Ahead\n\nThe pest control stock is flirting with a flat base ideal entry of 58.65, MarketSurge analysis shows.\n\nThe relative strength line is moving higher again following a recent decline, a positive. It has also bullishly reclaimed its 50-day moving average and also above the 21-day line.\n\nROL is an excellent all-around performer, which is reflected in its IBD Composite Rating of 97.\n\nPrice performance is its weakest feature, though Rollins is still among the top 21% of issues in terms of gains over the past 12 months. So far in 2025, it is up around 25%, which is excellent.\n\nFundamental performance is strong, with its EPS Rating coming in at 89 out of 99. In the most recent quarter earnings popped 11% to 30 cents per share while revenue climbed 12% to $1 billion.\n\nAnalysts see EPS rising 11% this year to $1.10, with a further 13% advance next year.\n\nInstitutions have been adding to their holdings of the stock lately, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B+.\n\nNevertheless, Rollins stock boasts a relatively lackluster level of institutional backing. Funds currently hold 30% of shares, MarketSurge data shows.\n\nHowever, the lauded Baron Asset Fund (BARAX) and the Virtus KAR Mid-Cap Growth Fund (PHSKX) are among the noteworthy holders.\n\nRollins is probably the largest bug killer in the world. It owns Orkin, Critter Control and many other insect and termite extermination companies in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.\n\nIts strong recent earnings report saw UBS, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Piper Sandler raised their price targets on the stock. Sandler said consumer demand remains strong, and June strength has continued into July. The second half of the year also shows potential for acceleration in organic sales.\n\nPlease follow Michael Larkin on X at @IBD_MLarkin for more analysis of growth stocks.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nSeven Best Stocks For Magnificent Earnings Growth\n\nJoin IBD Live Each Morning For Stock Tips Before The Open\n\nMarketSurge: Research, Charts, Data And Coaching All In One Place\n\nThis Is The Ultimate Warren Buffett Stock, But Should You Buy It?",

      "text": "Pfizer (PFE) stock jumped Tuesday after the S&P 500 pharma titan beat Wall Street's second-quarter expectations on the back of solid cost-cutting measures.\nPfizer is angling to cut $7.7 billion in costs by 2027, offsetting several notable research and development setbacks. As a result, the company came in with adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share on $14.65 billion in second-quarter sales.\nEarnings smashed forecasts by 20 cents per share and sales beat the $13.56 billion call from analysts polled by FactSet. On a year-over-year basis, earnings surged 30% while sale rose 10%.\nIn morning trades, Pfizer stock jumped nearly 4% to 24.47. Shares bounded above their 50-day line, though they remained well below their 200-day moving average, according to MarketSurge.\nCovid Products Boost Pfizer Stock\nEdward Jones analyst John Boylan called out better-than-expected sales of Covid products and Padcev, a cancer treatment acquired with Seagen. He noted revenue from migraine treatment Nurtec came in light and bears watching.\nSales of Covid vaccine Comirnaty, developed with BioNTech (BNTX), rocketed 96% to $381 million, while sales of oral treatment Paxlovid ramped 70% to $427 million. The Street projected a much lower $195 million and $240.5 million, respectively.\nBut sales of Covid-tied products are hard to predict. The lion's share of sales take place in the second half of the year, lining up with the fall season. But their strength often depends on the severity of the season.\n\"Still, it was good to see sales guidance overall maintained for the year despite COVID-19 sales uncertainty,\" Boylan said in a report.\nHe has a buy rating on Pfizer stock.\nFor the year, Pfizer called for $61 billion to $64 billion in sales. The company hiked its earnings outlook to a range of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. The latter includes a 20-cent hit due to a licensing deal with China's 3SBio.\nCost-Cutting Measures In Focus\nDaniel Barasa, portfolio manager for Gabelli Funds, notes Pfizer is already well into its plan to cut $7.7 billion in costs by 2027. This will help offset recent setbacks in research and development, and ease investors' worries about Pfizer's ability to pay its dividend.\nIn 2028, Pfizer's pipeline could come back into play and that's where investors have had their doubts, he said in an email to Investor's Business Daily. He calls out several experimental cancer drugs from the Seagen portfolio that could become blockbusters in the distant future.\nUntil then, \"we expect Pfizer will continue to be a margin story, as opposed to a top-line-driven story,\" he added.\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nHow Idexx Laboratories Is Riding The 'Puppy Boom' To New Highs\nInsmed Is Trading At A 25-Year High.

      "text": "Gold is increasingly in focus among traders, investors \u2014 and central banks.\nThe precious metal, which has been used as a financial asset for millennia, is prone to dizzying rallies and deep slumps. But despite the commodity\u2019s volatility, gold has repeatedly set records in recent years.\nSince March, investors have been increasing their holdings of gold, driven by concerns about the health of the economy and market volatility. Longer term, Goldman Sachs Research expects prices to be propelled by multi-year demand from central banks. Our analysts\u2019 gold price prediction is for these two factors to push the metal to new record highs.\nGoldman Sachs Research\u2019s gold price prediction 2025\nEven so, Thomas says gold is likely to break more records this year. Goldman Sachs Research predicts gold will rise to $3,700 a troy ounce by the end of 2025 (from $3,220 on May 15) as central banks buy many tonnes of the precious metal every month.\nThe commodity is also likely to climb as ETF investors increase their holdings in anticipation of interest rate cuts and amid growing recession concerns. In the event of a recession, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that gold could rise to as much as $3,880 a troy ounce.\nPrivate investors might also turn to gold to diversify away from US assets, particularly if traditional equity portfolio hedges such as US Treasuries continue to underperform during equity drawdowns. While not the team\u2019s base case forecast, Thomas says even a small rotation out of US assets into gold would have a big, positive impact on the gold price given the relative sizes of the markets. For example, global gold ETF holdings are worth only about 1% of outstanding US Treasuries and 0.5% of the S&P500 market cap.\n\u201cWhile the key factor since 2022 used to be central bank buying alone, ETF investors are now joining the gold rally,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cAs both compete for the same bullion, we are expecting gold prices to rise even further.\u201d\nThis article is being provided for educational purposes only.

      "text": "Related Research\n-\nMay 28, 2025\nVEEV: Commercial Cloud Acceleration Drives Meaningful Beat and Raise -\nMay 19, 2025\nVEEV: Salesforce Announces Another LS Cloud Commitment -\nMay 14, 2025\nGWRE: 1Q25 Preview: Vertical SaaS (GWRE, VEEV, ADSK, SKIL) -\nMay 4, 2025\nVEEV: Mid-Quarter Debates: Competition, Regulatory Uncertainty, Seasonality -\nMarch 18, 2025\nVEEV: Expert Call Series: CRM Platform Decisions Likely On Hold Pending Release of Life Science Cloud\nAnother T20 Enterprise Commits to Vault CRM With Merck Agreement\nSUMMARY\nThis morning, Veeva announced that Merck has committed to Vault CRM (link). This marks Veeva's sixth enterprise pharma Vault CRM commitment. The company is gaining momentum leading up to the September GA of Salesforce's Life Sciences Cloud for Customer Engagement. The announcement is incrementally positive, but it was broadly expected VEEV would secure a commitment from Merck, given its long-term strategic partnership with the company (link), and industry chatter that an agreement was an inevitability. That said, Merck is the largest pharma company globally by revenue and a strong endorsement for Vault CRM. Extrapolating current commitments (Veeva: six vs. Salesforce: two) would imply ~75% share for VEEV, which is still within investor expectations (~60%).\nKEY POINTS\n- Merck commits to Vault CRM: Veeva announce this morning that Merck has committed to migrating to Vault CRM. While incrementally positives, it was expected that Veeva would secure a commitment from Merck due to its long-term strategic partnership to take a Veeva-first approach to new industry-specific software and data. Regardless, it is still a significant commitment as Merck the largest pharma company globally by revenue.\n- Vault commitments tracking ahead of expectations: Veeva currently leads Salesforce with six Vault CRM commitments vs. Salesforce's two. Veeva has secured commitments from GSK, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novo Nordisk, Astellas, and now Merck. Salesforce has received commitments from Pfizer and Takeda. Extrapolating current commitments implies ~75% share for VEEV, within investor expectations (~60%).\n- Veeva has a meaningful head start: Veeva has made significant progress since announcing the move to Vault CRM over two years ago. It has 80 customers live on Vault CRM (200 expected by next summer) along with several migration proof points, and one T20 migration expected (2025). Veeva has also introduced platform innovations around Vault CRM with Service Center, Campaign Manager, and Patient CRM.\n- What's next? All eyes will be on Salesforce's GA of Life Sciences Cloud for Customer Engagement in September later this year. We expect there are several hold outs in the T20 waiting to see the product and to run competitive evaluations. Most partners expect the T20 to finalize CRM decisions by 2026 (link).\nCompany Description\nINVESTMENT THESIS\nWe believe Veeva's unique profile as a teens-plus grower with industry-leading operating margins (~40%) is durable due to the company's position as vendor of choice in life sciences, a strong pipeline of product to extend the growth runway, and narrow vertically-oriented investment focus. Veeva's premium valuation has been justified by consistently delivering growth and margins well above the Rule of 40, which remains the benchmarking standard in software.\nBASE CASE ASSUMPTION\n- Teens subscription and billings growth CAGR\n- Commercial Cloud subscription is likely to grow high single-digits\nCATALYSTS\n- F2Q26 results\n- Life Sciences RiFs (potential headline risks, despite being embedded in outlook)\n- Migration of Veeva CRM off of Salesforce's platform\n- Top 20 pharma customer signings\nDOWNSIDE SCENARIO\n- Recessionary headwinds cause life sciences customers to make more drastic reductions to sales force\n- IQVIA wins lawsuit, reigniting investor fears of data lockout for Veeva CRM\n- Re-platforming off Salesforce results in elevated customer churn\nUPSIDE SCENARIO\n- Commercial Cloud will cross double-digits growth with headwinds from pharma rep cuts, macro, and tough Engage comps softer than expected\n- New growth seeds, Data Cloud, and CDMS see faster than expected adoption\n- Lighter investment cycle will keep EBIT margins above 40%\nPRICE TARGET CALCULATION\nWe're increasing out PT to $325 from $280 on higher estimates and peer multiples. Our $325 PT is derived from an 8-year DCF, which projects a revenue CAGR of 13% and a terminal FCF margin of 49% (upper tier of vertical SaaS peers >45%). We applied a terminal cash flow multiple of 25x (~1.9x PEG), up from 20x, to arrive at FCF of $3.1B in 2033E, discounted at a WACC of 11%.\nKEY RISKS TO PRICE TARGET\nDownside risks to our rating and price target include:\n- Recessionary headwinds cause life sciences customers to make more drastic reductions to sales force and IT spending decision\n- Heightened competitive landscape across Clinical solutions challenge growth for Veeva\n- Migration of Veeva CRM off Salesforce's platform carries potential customer churn risk\nESG CONSIDERATIONS\n| ESG Rating Environment | D+ |\n|---|---|\n| ESG Rating Governance | B- |\n| ESG Rating Social | C+ |\n| ESG Rating | C+ |\n| *Environmental/Social/Governance (ESG) scores are courtesy of Refinitiv's ESG product which are designed to transparently and objectively measure a company's relative ESG performance, commitment and effectiveness, based on company-reported data.
