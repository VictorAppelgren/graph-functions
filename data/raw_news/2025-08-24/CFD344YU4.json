  "description": "The risks of attempted strangulation don't stay confined inside abusive homes, some law enforcers say. They also extend to police officers responding to the calls.",
  "content": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Police in Utah are well aware that someone who survives being strangled by a partner is at greater risk of being killed later on. When officers respond to calls of domestic violence, they gauge a victim's level of danger, in part by asking about any history of assault by choking.\n\nBut the risks of strangulation attempts don't stay confined inside abusive homes, some law enforcers say. They also extend to police officers themselves, according to Craig Kingsbury, a retired Idaho chief of police who led departments in Nampa and Twin Falls.\n\nWhen police on duty are attacked and either seriously wounded or killed, Kingsbury said, \"oftentimes, what you find out when you do the research is that the perpetrators had a history of some sort of extreme intimate partner violence, and most often strangulation.\"\n\nKingsbury noted that prosecutors also see this as the case in Utah, as Ryan Michael Bate, 32, is accused of shooting and killing two Tremonton police officers on Sunday. Bate's facing renewed charges of domestic violence after a woman reported last year that he grabbed her by the throat and threw her on a couch. Officers wrote in a report that they observed red marks on her neck.\n\nWith the help of a student research team from Boise State University, Kingsbury investigated the link between strangulation attempts and police shootings 20 years ago. He was motivated to do so, he told KSL, after one of his officers in Nampa was shot by a suspect with a history of domestic violence.\n\nKingsbury and a research team looked at 10 suspects in attacks on police, finding 80% had prior domestic violence history and 30% had attempted to strangle a partner in the past.\n\n\"Whether they were charged with that crime or not is irrelevant,\" he said. \"It's that if you start looking at that person's background, you will find an allegation of strangulation in a prior police report or even interviewing their past partners.\"\n\nUtah's had past examples, too. In 2021, a Sandy police officer was shot and injured by a suspect charged four years earlier with choking a woman \"for 45 seconds to a minute and she thought she was going to pass out and die,\" court records state.\n\nProsecutors later dropped that charge when they were unable to locate the victim. The outcome that doesn't surprise Kingsbury.\n\n\"They're not easy cases to prosecute most often, because you do have victims that recant for a variety of reasons,\" he said.\n\nKingsbury said, despite the difficulty, he believes police need to gather all the facts. When they do so, their thorough investigations help the justice system hold offenders accountable and provide them with rehabilitation services in prisons and jails.\n\nDoing so will help keep safe not just survivors of domestic violence and members of the public, Kingsbury said, but also the police officers charged with protecting them.\n\n\"The No.1 takeaway that I hope that our peace officers have from this is to conduct a very good investigation when you respond to a domestic violence call,\" Kingsbury said.",

      "text": "- Utah Department of Public Safety launched an interactive database to address domestic violence information gaps.\n- The database aims to improve officer decision-making and connect victims with services.\n- Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson emphasizes the importance of data and personal impact of violence.\nWEST JORDAN \u2014 Just days after the state was rocked by the death of two police officers responding to a domestic violence call in Box Elder County, the Department of Public Safety announced it is launching an interactive database aimed at filling informational gaps to prevent further domestic violence incidents.\n\"The tragedy ... stemmed from a domestic violence call. Which caused us to take a minute and decide, should we even convene today? But with that incident, it brings urgency to how important this cause is and why we gather to talk about such an important topic, and how we can make a difference in domestic violence and intimate partner violence,\" Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said at a press conference Thursday.\nThree years ago, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson lost her cousin to a domestic violence homicide. That experience made Henderson realize there was a \"terrible gap\" in the system as law enforcement responded to domestic violence-related calls.\n\"This lethal gap that we had in the system where law enforcement officers ... were not necessarily getting the information they needed to make wise discretionary decisions on the spot on the scene of a call. Sometimes a situation doesn't look all that bad on the surface,\" she said.\nIn response, she worked with the Department of Public Safety to create the Utah Intimate Partner Lethality Assessment Protocol, which gives officers an additional tool on scene they can use to identify the danger victims are in, assess the seriousness of their situations and connect victims with service providers.\n\"These deaths are preventable. There have been dozens of them since the law was enacted two years ago. I look forward to the day when we have rooted out this scourge in our society,\" Henderson said.\nThe protocol has been implemented statewide, giving officers the ability to survey a situation, pass the information to the Statewide Information Analysis Center and get a result within 15 minutes that helps them make educated decisions on how to aid victims. Since implementation, about 23,000 Lethality Assessment Protocols have been conducted, with 60% showing victims at a high risk of lethal violence.\n\"That should cause us all to pause and realize the seriousness of the situation,\" Mason said. \"Domestic violence is one of the most dangerous calls there is, whether that's for the victim or the officer on scene. We owe it to those people involved to use every tool at our discretion to improve that public safety.\"\nAs the next step in continuing the progress, the Department of Public Safety is launching an interactive Lethality Assessment Protocol dashboard that will make the data more visible to allow lawmakers, law enforcement agencies and service providers to identify further gaps and issues that need to be addressed.\n\"Data is important. The faces and the names and the families behind the data are even more important \u2014 and what we do with this data, what we do with this information is critical,\" Henderson said.\nRelated:\nHenderson said she is excited for the state to have this information, as it can be used to make better public policy decisions for both victims and offenders.\nRep. Ryan Wilcox said while the program has been helping, the state is still \"missing the boat on what happens with those who are the perpetrators.\" He spoke of how Ryan Michael Bate, the man accused of killing the two police officers, has previously had run-ins with police for prior domestic violence situations.\n\"We had him. We issued the protocol, and it gave us the information we were looking for, and he didn't murder her at that time. In the back of my mind all week, ever since I read the report, has been 'What should we have done differently then that would've prevented the loss of life of these officers now?\" Wilcox said.\nThursday's announcement of the dashboard will help people see all relevant information to \"put that whole picture together, help us to make the better decisions we are looking for that actually keep people safe,\" he said.\n'It's personal'\nWilcox was a bill sponsor for the legislation that implemented the Lethality Assessment Protocol. People's view that domestic violence that doesn't affect them needs to change, as it impacts everyone, he said.\n\"It is personal. Until you are called at the last minute, in my case, by a friend or a family member and asked to come rescue someone over the holiday because they are not safe, I don't think it quite hits the same as when you are talking about it in a community,\" Wilcox said.\nLindsey Boyer, director of domestic violence advocate group South Valley Services, agreed with Wilcox, stating too many families and communities are being impacted by the \"devastating epidemic\" of domestic violence.\n\"Even if we aren't experiencing it directly, we all know and care about someone who is impacted directly,\" she said. \"Lives are at risk every day ... in all corners of our state.\"\nDespite \"tremendous progress,\" domestic violence is \"a real threat,\" and people need to be educated on the warning signs to prevent further violence, Boyer said. Victims can be connected to lifesaving services that help them have a violence-free future, she added.\n\"We need our community to take this issue personal. It's happening here; these are our people. These are our friends, our neighbors, and these people need us in their corner. ... This issue needs everyone's attention, and victims need your support \u2014 their lives literally depend on it,\" Boyer said.\nSgt. Jen Faumuina, of the Department of Public Safety, has been training officers all over the state in the program and said the implementation has helped open police officers' eyes to know what help victims need.\n\"It's been a positive impact not only for the officers but for the victims, and I think overall it has helped with the safety of the community,\" Faumuina said."

      "text": "- Ryan Michael Bate, accused of killing two police officers, sobbed during his first court appearance Friday.\n- Bate faces charges of capital murder and prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty.\n- Funeral services for the officers are scheduled for Aug. 28 and 29 in Logan.\nBRIGHAM CITY \u2014 The man accused of shooting and killing two police officers in Box Elder County was visibly sobbing throughout his initial appearance in court Friday.\nWhile waiting for his initial hearing to start \u2014 which was held remotely \u2014 Ryan Michael Bate, 32, of Tremonton, was crying and rocking back and forth in the hearing room at the Weber County Jail.\nBate is accused of opening fire on police officers who had responded to his residence for a domestic violence call. The shots killed Tremonton-Garland police officer Eric Estrada, 31, and Sgt. Lee Sorensen, 56, and injured Box Elder County sheriff's deputy Mike Allred and his police K-9, Azula, a 3-year-old female Belgian Malinois.\nBate was charged Wednesday with two counts of aggravated murder, a capital offense, and prosecutors announced they will seek the death penalty.\nBate also faces 18 other charges, including four counts of attempted aggravated murder, a first-degree felony; endangering a police service dog, a third-degree felony; three counts of possessing an explosive, a second-degree felony; two counts of possession of a dangerous weapon with criminal intent, three counts of assault, unlawful detention and threatening violence, class A misdemeanors; and three counts of domestic violence in the presence of a child, a class B misdemeanor.\nTremonton police responded late Sunday to a 911 hangup call at the Bate residence. Bate's wife called emergency dispatchers and hung up in an attempt to get police to come to her home after Bate \"slammed her head with a door, and grabbed her by the throat and pushed her against the wall,\" charging documents state. \"As the wife tried to calm (Bate) down, he repeatedly threatened to kill her.\"\nBut when the first officer arrived and spoke to the wife, she \"assured (him) there was no physical violence,\" according to the charges. However, as the officer began to drive away, Bate took a \"high-powered rifle\" and fired at the officer, but missed, according to police.\nAfter calling for backup, the officer got out of the car to try to help the woman, who started running down the street, but he was shot and killed. A second officer was shot and killed while assisting the first, charges state.\nShortly after, Allred and Azula arrived as backup. Bate fired again, injuring the deputy and striking the K-9 cage, causing injuries to Azula. Both are recovering.\nPolice say Bate also shot at a neighbor's vehicle, barely missing the driver. He then \"approached the two fallen officers with a revolver and a rifle in hand as he continued to look around for other targets,\" before bystanders convinced him to put down the weapons, the charges say. After he was taken into custody, officers searched Bate's home and reported finding three Molotov cocktails.\nBate was also arrested and charged last year for another domestic violence incident at the same house. Those charges were later dismissed, according to court records, but the Box Elder County Attorney's Office refiled those previous charges on Wednesday. Bate is charged in that case with aggravated assault and three counts of domestic violence in the presence of a child, third-degree felonies; and causing property damage, a class A misdemeanor.\nWhile Judge Spencer Walsh read the 25 total charges filed against Bate, Bate kept his head down, not looking at the camera.\nDefense attorneys Jonathan Nish and Mary Corporon were appointed to represent Bate in the capital case. Nish said he would speak with the Utah Indigent Defense Commission to also represent Bate on the second case.\nProsecutor Blair Wardle filed a request for a pre-trial protective order for the domestic violence victim and three children, who were not named. Bate started visibly sobbing again when the judge read out the instructions on the protective order and explained that there would be no contact with the children unless approved by family court.\nThe defense requested extra time to prepare for the next hearing and the judge scheduled it for Oct. 30.\nA viewing for both of the slain officers will be held at Bear River High School in Tremonton on Wednesday, Aug. 27, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.\nEstrada's funeral is scheduled for Thursday, Aug. 28, at 10 a.m. and Sorensen's will be Friday, Aug. 29, at 10 a.m. Both services will be held at the Utah State University Spectrum in Logan."
