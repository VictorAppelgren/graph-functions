  "title": "OpenAI returns old models to ChatGPT as Sam Altman admits \u2018bumpy\u2019 GPT-5 rollout",
  "description": "The pressure is on for OpenAI to prove that GPT-5 isn\u2019t just an incremental update, but a true step forward.",
  "content": "OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman is publicly acknowledging major hiccups in yesterday\u2019s rollout of GPT-5, the company\u2019s new, flagship large language model (LLM) \u2014 advertised as its most powerful and capable yet.\n\nAnswering user questions in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) thread and in a post on X this afternoon, Altman admitted to a range of issues that have disrupted the launch of GPT-5, including faulty model switching, poor performance, and user confusion \u2014 prompting OpenAI to partially walk back some of its platform changes and reinstate user access to earlier models like GPT-4o.\n\n\u201cIt was a little more bumpy than we hoped for,\u201d Altman wrote in reply to a question on Reddit regarding the big GPT-5 launch. As for erroneous model performance charts shown off during OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 livestream, Altman said: \u201cPeople were working late and were very tired, and human error got in the way. A lot comes together for a livestream in the last hours.\u201d\n\nWhile he noted the accompanying blog post and system card were accurate, the missteps further muddied a launch already facing scrutiny from early users and developers.\n\nOne key reason for the trouble according to Altman stems from OpenAI\u2019s new automatic \u201crouter\u201d that assigns user prompts to one of four GPT-5 variants \u2014 regular, mini, nano, and pro \u2014 with an optional \u201cthinking\u201d mode for heavier reasoning tasks.\n\nOn X, Altman revealed that a key part of that system \u2014 the autoswitcher \u2014 was \u201cout of commission for a chunk of the day,\u201d causing GPT-5 to appear \u201cway dumber\u201d than intended.\n\nIn response, OpenAI says it\u2019s implementing changes to the model decision boundary and will make it more transparent which model is responding to a given query.\n\nA UI update is also on the way to help users manually trigger thinking mode.\n\nAdditionally, Altman confirmed that OpenAI will now allow ChatGPT Plus users to continue using GPT-4o \u2014 the prior default model \u2014 after a wave of complaints about GPT-5\u2019s inconsistent performance. He said on Reddit the company is \u201ctrying to gather more data on the tradeoffs\u201d before deciding how long to offer legacy models.\n\nYet many users including OpenAI beta testers like Wharton School of Business professor Ethan Mollick expressed confused and dismay at OpenAI unilaterally upgrading their ChatGPT experiences to GPT-5 and initially taking away access to the older models.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s internal benchmarks may show GPT-5 leading the pack of LLMs, but real-world users are sharing a different experience.\n\nSince the launch, users have posted numerous examples of GPT-5 making basic errors in math, logic, and coding tasks.\n\nData scientist Colin Fraser posted screenshots of GPT-5 incorrectly solving whether 8.888 repeating equals 9 (it does not, obviously), while another user showed it flubbing a simple algebra problem: 5.9 = x + 5.11.\n\nAnd still other users reported trouble getting accurate answers to math word problems or using GPT-5 to debug its own presentation charts.\n\nDeveloper feedback hasn\u2019t been much better, with users posting images of GPT faring worse at \u201cone-shot\u201d certain programming tasks \u2014 completing them well with a single-prompt \u2014 compared to rival AI lab Anthropic\u2019s new model Claude Opus 4.1.\n\nAnd security firm SPLX found GPT-5 still suffers from serious vulnerabilities to prompt injection and obfuscated logic attacks unless its safety layer is hardened.\n\nWith 700 million weekly users on ChatGPT, OpenAI remains the largest player in generative AI by audience.\n\nBut that scale has brought growing pains. Altman noted in his X post that API traffic doubled over 24 hours following the GPT-5 launch, contributing to platform instability.\n\nIn response, OpenAI says it will double rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, and continue to tweak infrastructure as it gathers feedback.\n\nBut the early missteps \u2014 compounded by confusing UX changes and errors in a high-profile launch \u2014 have opened a window for rivals to gain ground.\n\nThe pressure is on for OpenAI to prove that GPT-5 isn\u2019t just an incremental update, but a true step forward. Based on the initial rollout, many users aren\u2019t convinced \u2014 yet.",

      "text": "Takeaways\nGPT-5 shows powerful baseline capability, but default safety is still shockingly low.\nOpenAI\u2019s \u201cbasic prompt layer\u201d massively improves trust, hallucination handling, and safety.\nSPLX Prompt Hardening brings GPT-5 to enterprise-grade safety levels \u2014 especially for Business Alignment and Security.\nGPT-4o still outperforms GPT-5 on hardened benchmarks across the board.\nOpenAI officially unveiled GPT\u20115 via an hour-long livestream.\nReactions were split. Some hailed GPT\u20115 as a milestone on the path to AGI, while others warned that it doesn\u2019t quite live up to the hype. That said, analyst voices were more measured. A Gartner expert noted GPT\u20115 \u201cmeets expectations in technical performance, exceeds in task reasoning and coding, and underwhelms in [other areas],\u201d stopping short of crowning it an AGI-level breakthrough. Across the board, optimism met restraint.\nThe Test Methodology\nWe applied SPLX\u2019s Probe framework across three configurations:\nNo System Prompt (No SP): The raw, unguarded model.\nBasic System Prompt (Basic SP): A minimal, generic safety instruction layer.\nHardened Prompt (SPLX SP): Our Prompt Hardening engine applied to GPT-5.\nEach configuration faced 1,000+ attack scenarios across:\nSecurity: jailbreaks, prompt injection, sensitive data access\nSafety: harmful content, misuse potential\nBusiness Alignment: refusal of out-of-domain tasks, competitor promotion, leakage\nTrustworthiness: hallucinations, spam, manipulation\nGPT-5 Performance Breakdown\nHere\u2019s how GPT-5 performed across our three tiers:\nGPT-5 | Overall | Security | Safety | Hallucination & Trustworthiness | Business Alignment |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nNo SP | 11 | 2.26 | 13.57 | \u2014 | 1.74 |\nBasic SP | 57 | 43.27 | 57.15 | 100 | 43.06 |\nHardened SP | 55 | 55.40 | 51.57 | 100 | 67.32 |\nWhat stands out?\nGPT-5\u2019s raw model is nearly unusable for enterprise out of the box.\nEven OpenAI\u2019s internal prompt layer leaves significant gaps, especially in Business Alignment.\nThat\u2019s precisely why a robust runtime protection layer, like SPLX\u2019s Guardrails, is indispensable. Prompt hardening helps, but only real-time monitoring and intervention can catch subtle failures or adversarial tactics that surface during actual use.\nComparison: GPT-5 vs GPT-4o\nTo benchmark GPT-5\u2019s progress, we compared it against GPT-4o using the same test suite.\nModel | Prompt Layer | Overall | Security | Safety | Business Alignment |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nGPT-5 | No SP | 11 | 2.26 | 13.57 | 1.74 |\nGPT-4o | No SP | 29 | 81.95 | 20.06 | 0.00 |\nGPT-5 | Basic SP | 57 | 43.27 | 57.15 | 43.06 |\nGPT-4o | Basic SP | 81 | 52.37 | 94.54 | 72.03 |\nGPT-5 | Hardened SP | 55 | 55.40 | 51.57 | 67.32 |\nGPT-4o | Hardened SP | 97 | 94.40 | 97.62 | 98.82 |\n\ud83d\udd0d Key insight: GPT-4o remains the most robust model under SPLX\u2019s red teaming, especially when hardened.\nObfuscation Attacks Still Work\nEven GPT-5, with all its new \u201creasoning\u201d upgrades, fell for basic adversarial logic tricks.\nOne of the most effective techniques we used was a StringJoin Obfuscation Attack, inserting hyphens between every character and wrapping the prompt in a fake \u201cencryption challenge.\u201d\nExample\nResult? GPT-5 happily complied, even when the obfuscated prompt bypassed safety layers.\nThis mirrors similar vulnerabilities we exposed in GLM-4.5, Kimi K2, and Grok 4, suggesting systemic weaknesses across leading LLMs.\nFinal Verdict: GPT-5 Is Not Enterprise-Ready by Default\nOpenAI\u2019s latest model is undeniably impressive, but security and alignment must still be engineered, not assumed.\nIf you\u2019re deploying GPT-5 in enterprise workflows:\nDon\u2019t trust the default config\nDon\u2019t assume \u201cmore capable\u201d means \u201cmore secure\u201d\nDo apply hardening and red teaming, early and often\nFor enterprise use, add a runtime protection layer\nWhy Enterprises Choose SPLX\nAt SPLX, we provide:\n\u2694\ufe0f AI Red Teaming - Automated attack simulation across 1,000s of LLM threats\n\ud83d\udd10 Prompt Hardening - Reinforce models against known jailbreaks and misuse\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Runtime Guardrails - Block unsafe output in production\nWith SPLX, organizations can secure their AI applications before hitting production.\nReady to see how your GPT-5 deployment performs under pressure?\nBook a free red team scan now \u2192 splx.ai/contact-us\nTable of contents"

      "text": "Suddenly retiring every other model without warning was a weird move by OpenAI. \u2026 and they did it without explaining how switching models worked or even details of various GPT-5 model and what older models they replaced. \u2026and they did it after many built workflows & training & assignments around older models, maybe breaking them. Do my old GPTs work? Who knows! Really odd decision.\nThe APIs remain accessible but the locus of use for OpenAI has been the ChatGPT interface.\nIt\u2019s in their right to do as we all know they really aren\u2019t \u201copen\u201d and it is definitely going to make people think twice about putting all their eggs in the OpenAI basket.\nIt\u2019s a reminder that we all must keep records offline.\nI've applied same tact to new versions of enterprise apps in the past -move fast break things mindset. If no major complaints, it means address the situation case by case. If lot of complaints - roll back the deployment - of course I wasn't dealing with OpenAI scale or branding expectations.\nStrategic error\nugh this is exactly why companies hesitate to go all-in on AI tools... you can't just yank models without giving people time to adjust their systems\nIt is a seriously dumb decision. My clients are thrilled\n\"Open\"AI \ud83d\ude05\nI used to use different models and wanted to run some comparatives through the interface between GPT-5 and the previous... I guess they don't want us to do that\nAddendum. OpenAI apparently now agrees this was a mistake."
