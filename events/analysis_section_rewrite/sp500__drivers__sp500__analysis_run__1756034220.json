      "feedback": "The draft has a solid cross‑topic spine (AI moat, Shopify results, policy backdrop and cross‑asset cues) but it reads more as a narrative than a falsifiable, fundam entals‑driven thesis; to reach world‑class quality, sharpen the causal chain, build explicit scenarios, attach every assertion to a numeric anchor from the sources, and deliver a tight watch‑list with decisive signals. Specifically, tighten the link from “AI moat” to durable ROIC and cash‑flow power by translating Shopify’s H1 metrics (GMV up 27% to ~$163B; revenue up ~29%; op income up 51%; US e‑commerce GMV share ≈ 12% of addressable market) into an estimated ROIC trajectory or cash‑flow lift, with a clearly stated assumption set; add a formal three‑scenario framework (base/bull/bear) with triggers and explicit invalidation points (e.g., CPI/payroll in line/cetter for easing; policy path shifts) and map each scenario to margin/valuation outcomes; replace broad claims with precise numbers anchored to sources (e.g., base‑case: Sept rate cut 25bp, 10‑year near 4.23%, ACMR 2025 rev guidance 850–950m, gross margin ≈49%, D/E ≈23%, Shopify GMV share ~12%; confirm how these feed into ROIC/EV/FCF). Build a concise watch‑list of decisive signals with thresholds drawn directly from sources: CPI/payroll confirming easing (GX057ADL7; SK994CBWR), the Sept rate cut 25bp timing, 10‑year yield moves around 4.0–4.3% depending on data (GX057ADL7; TN66GHPAT), ACMR updates (850–950m rev, ~49% gross margin, 23% debt/equity), IBM hiring pause and other productivity signals (4LQD15CFU), IPO momentum (GX057ADL7; SK994CBWR), and EURUSD regime shifts (5S9GJV2O3; UVEQ2SJ0W; HWGNUP2XG). Ensure the FX/POV linkage is explicit: explain how AI capex, governance frictions, and consumer margin pressure feed into EURUSD dynamics and equity risk premia. Reconcile potential conflicts (e.g., easing policy vs. yields around 4% and cross‑asset dispersion) by articulating the mechanism (lower discount rates boost tech/AI platforms’ multiples; sector rotation depends on inflation path). Citations should be placed after the specific claims they support and cover all critical inputs (QFDWCTAYB; GX057ADL7; SK994CBWR; TN66GHPAT; 4LQD15CFU; 5S9GJV2O3; UVEQ2SJ0W; HWGNUP2XG) with no extraneous IDs. Finally, tighten prose into shorter sentences and clearly label the core conclusion upfront, followed by the structured scenario framework and the watch‑list, so the piece reads as an explicit, testable investment thesis rather than a narrative synthesis.",
