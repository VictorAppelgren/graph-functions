DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

[Victor\u2019s] really brave, and I hope he\u2019s good in the hospital.\u201d\nHalsen is praying for the others injured in the horrific attack, but noted feeling \u201crelieved\u201d when he finally got to hug his mom, who was the first person he saw outside the church when he escaped the mayhem.\nPat Scallen, who lives down the street from the school, \u201cran right to the church\u201d when he heard the sound of gunfire. The shooting had stopped by the time he arrived \u2014 and wounded children started exiting through the front doors.\n\u201cAbout three of the kids came out, two of them were pretty badly hurt,\u201d the former Annunciation student told CNN, adding that one child had been shot in the neck, a young girl was grazed across the forehead and a third seemed to have an injured arm.\n\u201cThey needed someone, and they were in distress. I felt it was important to calm them down and let them know that someone was with them and help was on the way.\u201d\nNorris Roberts, the step-grandfather of a 12-year-old boy wounded in the stomach, said the child is recovering after surgery but fears he may suffer long-term mental anguish from witnessing another student get shot in the head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrific for him to go through that, and it\u2019s going to be a lifelong problem for him,\u201d Roberts said, the New York Times reported.\n\u201cI can\u2019t fathom that happened, and you being stable. It\u2019s not normal.\u201d\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar revealed a former staff member had three children inside the church when the deranged Westman unleashed his barrage of bullets, including one who saw two classmates get shot.\nThe lawmaker, citing one of the young witnesses, said the terrified children dove to the ground for cover as bullets tore through the sacred windows of the church.\n\u201cShe watched a child get shot in the stomach and another in the neck,\u201d the Democrat told the Times.\n\u201cKids were scrambling down in the pews to protect themselves.\u201d\nMichael Simpon, grandfather of a 10-year-old who was nicked by a bullet, said he doesn\u2019t know why God didn\u2019t protect his grandson and the other victims during the mass carnage.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where He is,\u201d Simpson said of God, The Associated Press reported.\nThe 23-year-old shooter was not known to law enforcement and had no criminal record.\nWestman \u2014 who reportedly wrote \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d on his gun magazines \u2014 died in the back of the church of a self-inflicted gun wound.\nHe was armed with a \u201crifle, a shotgun and a pistol,\u201d O\u2019Hara told reporters, describing the shooting as \u201csheer cruelty and cowardice.\u201d\nPolice are still investigating a possible manifesto for Westman\u2019s heinous crimes, which was allegedly uploaded to YouTube shortly before the killings and then taken down by the video-sharing website."

      "text": "Minneapolis Catholic school shooter ID\u2019d as trans woman Robin Westman\u2014 while possible manifesto shows psychotic obsession with mass shooters\nThe deranged gunman who slaughtered two children and injured at least 17 others at a Catholic school in Minneapolis has been identified as a transgender woman \u2014 as disturbing videos posted by the shooter show a handwritten manifesto and \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d scrawled on gun magazines.\nRobin Westman, formerly Robert Westman, opened fire through the stained glass windows of a church at the Annunciation Catholic School \u2014 where he attended \u2014 during a celebratory back-to-school Mass filled with children around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday.\nJust hours before the cowardly massacre, Westman, 23, posted a series of twisted videos on YouTube, which included a manifesto, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara confirmed at a press conference.\nIn one 20-minute video, Westman flips through the disturbing handwritten manifesto, much of it in Cyrillic.\nIn the deranged writings, he gleefully fantasizes about \u201cbeing that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids\u201d and reverently confesses admiration for the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\nIn the video, titled \u201cSo long and thanks for all the fish,\u201d Westman slowly turns the pages of the red notebook, which is laid out on top of what appears to be schematic gun diagrams, one of them reading \u201cRuger Mark IV.\u201d\nAs he flips the pages, an occasional plume of smoke is seen from the bottom of the screen, punctuated by coughs, disjointed cursing and maniacal giggles.\nEach page is filled with inscrutable handwritten doggerel, which includes violent ramblings such as \u201cI have had thoughts about mass murder for a long time. I am very conflicted with writing this journal,\u201d the text, translated by The Post, reads in part.\n\u201cI need to get my thoughts out without getting on a watchlist haha!\u201d\nHere is the latest on the mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school:\n- Minneapolis Catholic school shooter ID\u2019d as trans woman Robin Westman\u2014 while possible manifesto shows psychotic obsession with mass shooters\n- Mom of Minneapolis mass shooter Robin Westman worked at Catholic school where he opened fire, killing 2 kids: police\n- Minneapolis shooting live updates: 5th grader recounts terrifying moment hero classmate was shot \u2014 while shielding him\n- Minneapolis gunman kills 2 Catholic school kids, wounds 14 after barricading doors as they prayed in back-to-school Mass\nHe also goes into great detail about his decision to target Annunciation, where he graduated from grade school in 2017, according to a yearbook obtained by CNN.\nHis mother, Mary Grace Westman, also worked as a secretary at the school until retiring in 2021, according to a Facebook post by the church.\n\u201cI am feeling good about annunciation. It seems like a good combo of easy attack form and devastating tragedy and I want to do more research. I have concerns about finding a large enough group. I want to avoid any parents, but pre and post school drop off,\u201d another page reads.\n\u201cMaybe I could attack an event at the on-site church,\u201d he ominously scribbled. \u201cI think attacking a large group of kids coming in from recess is my best plan \u2026 Then from there I can go inside and kill, going for as long as I can.\u201d\nThe journal contains a number of other subtle clues about Weston\u2019s identity \u2014 hinting at an angry melange of left-leaning politics and antisemitism.\nOne page includes a trans pride flag sticker with \u201cDefend equality\u201d printed across the bottom, with a black AK-47 sticker laid on top.\nIn another entry, he writes, \u201cIf I carry out a racially motivated attack, it would be most likely against filthy Zionist jews,\u201d before calling Jewish people \u201centitled\u201d and \u201cpenny-sniffing\u201d before adding \u201cFREE PALESTINE!\u201d\n\u201cI hate fascism,\u201d read yet another page, following it up shortly after with \u201cI also love when kids get shot, I love to see kids get torn apart.\u201d\nThe demented manifesto sheds light on what appears to be a truly disturbed mind, with Weston musing about a grand \u201cfinal act\u201d \u2014 stating a desire to take out \u201ca target of political or societal significance\u201d before he died.\n\u201cTargets like [Elon] Musk, Trump or some significant exec.\u201d\nHe also indicated that he knew the Annunciation shooting would culminate in his death.\nThe unhinged shooter also expressed sincere admiration for mass shooters \u2014 including Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza.\n\u201cI have a deep fascination with one man in particular: Adam Lanza,\u201d he wrote in the journal on May 23 in reference to the 20-year-old perpetrator of the worst elementary school shooting in US history, which left 20 first-grade students and six adults dead.\n\u201cSandy Hook was my favorite, I think, exposure of school shootings.\u201d\nNear the end of the video, Westman flicks through a number of blank pages before reaching what appears to be a drawing showing the inside of a church, saying \u201cHaha, nice\u201d as he stops turning pages.\nHe then takes out a knife and stabs into the center of the sketch, his hand momentarily quivering before he withdraws the blade, and quietly mumbles, \u201ckill myself.\u201d\nAnother video posted to YouTube in the hours before the sickening slaughter showed off a cache of weapons \u2014 including a semi-automatic rifle and a shotgun.\nMagazines were scrawled with \u201cfor the children\u201d and \u201ckill Donald Trump.\u201d\nWestman applied to change his birth name from Robert to Robin in Dakota County, Minn., when he was 17 years old, according to court documents. That name change was granted in January 2020.\nThe petition added that Westman \u201cidentifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\u201d\nWestman, who died at the scene of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun.\nThe shooter was not previously known to law enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara told reporters at a press conference."

      "text": "Minneapolis gunman kills 2 Catholic school kids, wounds 14 after barricading doors as they prayed in back-to-school Mass\nAt least two children are dead and 17 people injured after a crazed gunman opened fire at a Catholic school church in Minneapolis early Wednesday \u2014 barricading the doors and unleashing hell as students were praying during a morning Mass.\nThe maniac \u2014 wielding a rifle, shotgun and pistol \u2014 approached the side of the Annunciation Catholic Church and started firing through the windows, striking the scores of children praying in the pews just before 8:30 a.m., police and officials said.\nTwo kids, ages 8 and 10, were killed. In total, 17 people \u2014 including 14 kids \u2014 were injured, cops said. The three adult victims were all parishioners in their 80s who were attending the Mass.\nAll of the wounded victims are expected to survive.\nThe lone gunman, identified by sources as Robin Westman, had put a wooden plank against some of the church\u2019s side doors in an apparent attempt to trap the students and staff inside the sanctuary as he fired shots from all three guns.\n\u201cThis was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping. The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,\u201d Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said, who later noted Westman\u2019s weapons were all purchased legally and recently.\nThe gunman, who cops said was in his 20s, was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nOf the injured, two children were in a critical condition, police said.\nFifth grade Annunciation student Weston Halsne told NBC News his friend Victor was shot while attempting to shield him from bullets during the Mass. The young survivor said he hid under a pew when the shooting started \u2014 just as he\u2019d learned in active shooter drills at the school.\nAt least six children were being treated at Children\u2019s Minnesota \u2014 a pediatric trauma hospital, according to officials. Hennepin Healthcare, which has Minnesota\u2019s largest emergency department, said it had received 11 patients.\nHere is the latest on the mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school:\n- Minneapolis Catholic school shooter ID\u2019d as trans woman Robin Westman\u2014 while possible manifesto shows psychotic obsession with mass shooters\n- Mom of Minneapolis mass shooter Robin Westman worked at Catholic school where he opened fire, killing 2 kids: police\n- Minneapolis shooting live updates: 5th grader recounts terrifying moment hero classmate was shot \u2014 while shielding him\n- Minneapolis gunman kills 2 Catholic school kids, wounds 14 after barricading doors as they prayed in back-to-school Mass\n\u201cThese were Minneapolis families. These were American families. And the amount of pain that they are suffering right now is extraordinary,\u201d an emotional Mayor Jacob Frey said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cThey should be able to go to school or church in peace without the fear of violence.\u201d\nAuthorities haven\u2019t yet determined a motive for the bloodshed but investigators are currently reviewing an apparent manifesto and videos that detail, in part, the gunman\u2019s psychotic obsession with mass shooters.\nA sick 20-minute video posted on YouTube before the shooting showed a hand turning pages of a red notebook laid out on top of what appears to be schematic gun diagrams.\nO\u2019Hara said Westman had specifically timed the release of the manifesto, which has since been taken offline with FBI assistance.\nOther videos show an obsession with mass shooters \u2014 including Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza.\nOfficials have said the shooter did not have a known extensive criminal history. Court records revealed Westman changed his name from Robert to Robin in 2020 and identifies as transgender.\nAt the Wednesday afternoon press conference, Minneapolis\u2019 lefty mayor Jacob Frey scolded people he claims were \u201cvillainizing our trans community\u201d in the wake of the mass shooting, accusing them of having \u201clost their sense of common humanity.\u201d\nThe school, which is located next door to the church, is for kindergarten through eighth-graders.\nStudents, who had only just returned to class on Monday, were attending an all-school Mass at the time.\nIn a heart-wrenching statement Wednesday afternoon, Church of the Annunciation said they were \u201cnavigating an impossible situation,\u201d and thanked law enforcement and the community for their support, urging prayers for the students who were still hospitalized.\nScores of local and state police, federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and other authorities descended on the scene after the shooting broke out.\nBill Bienemann, who lives just a few blocks away and has long attended Mass at Annunciation Church, recalled hearing dozens of shots over several minutes.\n\u201cI was shocked. I said, \u2018There\u2019s no way that could be gunfire,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere was so much of it. It was sporadic.\u201d\nA reunification zone was set up near the school, while others were being urged to stay away \u201cto allow emergency personnel to help victims.\u201d\nParents could be seen escorting students for the school in the aftermath.\nPresident Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were among those briefed on the shooting early on.\n\u201cPlease join me in praying for everyone involved!\u201d Trump said on social media.\nIn his own post, Walz said: \u201cI\u2019m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence.\u201d\nThe shooting was just the latest in a series of fatal shootings in the city in less than 24 hours.\nOne person was killed and six others were hurt in a shooting Tuesday afternoon outside a high school in Minneapolis.\nHours later, two people died in two other shootings in the city.\nThe church shooting, though, didn\u2019t appear to be related to the others, the police chief said.\nWith Post wires"
