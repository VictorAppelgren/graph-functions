  "content": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was denied bail this week as he awaits his October sentencing after being found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. On Thursday, his lead attorney for the trial, Marc Agnifilo, discussed what\u2019s next for the disgraced music mogul \u2014 including the logistics behind a possible pardon.\n\nHowever, it was the lawyer\u2019s comments about his client\u2019s past relationship with ex-girlfriend and accuser/plaintiff Cassie that stood out in his first network sit-down interview following last month\u2019s split verdict.\n\u2022 None Diddy\u2019s Lead Attorney Calls Cassie Relationship a \u2018Modern Love Story\u2019 in First Network Interview Since Trial | Video\n\u2022 None Rene\u00e9 Rapp Explains Why She Called Out \u2018Sex Lives of College Girls\u2019 on New Album: \u2018God Forbid a Girl Uses Wordplay\u2019 | Video\n\u2022 None Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s Son Jack Pays Emotional Tribute to Late Rocker\u2019s Death in Emotional Tribute: \u2018I Love You Dad\u2019\n\n\u201cThe rape we vehemently deny. I respect that she said that, I don\u2019t think the jury concluded that that happened,\u201d Agnifilo told CBS Mornings\u2019 Jericka Duncan. \u201cIn terms of the drugs and the other stuff, I think that\u2019s what makes it a modern love story. I think she very much loved him and I know he very much loved her.\u201d\n\nIn response, Cassie\u2019s attorney Doug Wilder told CBS News that the comments were a \u201ccomplete disgrace and an affront to survivors of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Agnifilo admitted he has \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the possibility of President Donald Trump granting Diddy a pardon: \u201cI think he knows I\u2019m not political. We\u2019ve never discussed it, apart from I tell him what\u2019s in the news about it.\u201d\n\nThe rapper\u2019s attorney also explained what could happen at his sentencing, tentatively set for Oct. 3. \u201cI tell him what the guidelines are \u2014 and the guidelines are about two or three years \u2014 and I tell him the judge could go above the guidelines,\u201d Agnifilo shared.\n\nDiddy was found not guilty on one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking by force after the seven-week trial where 34 witnesses gave testimony in regards to his five federal charges. In the end, he dodged a life sentence.\n\nAccording to Duncan, Agnifilo also noted that Diddy wanted to testify in the trial, eventually wants to perform onstage again at Madison Square Garden and \u201chas the tremendous misfortune of having lawyers all around him all the time,\u201d when it comes to legal fees.\n\nThe White House declined to comment to CBS on speculation about any potential pardon, noting that a decision would come directly from Trump himself.\n\nThe post Diddy\u2019s Lead Attorney Calls Cassie Relationship a \u2018Modern Love Story\u2019 in First Network Interview Since Trial | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",
