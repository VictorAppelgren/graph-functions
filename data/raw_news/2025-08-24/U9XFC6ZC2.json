  "title": "Boden's 'flattering' paisley dress 'perfect for autumn'",
  "description": "Shoppers can step into the new season in style with this Boden dress",
  "content": "Finding the ideal dress, that isn\u2019t fussy or frumpy, that can be worn with flats and heels, and with tights or without, can be a lifelong challenge. This Ivy Smocked Midi Dress from Boden might just be a contender, though, particularly as the season shifts into autumn. Available in sizes 4 up to 22, as well as small, regular and long, depending on body size and shape, it really is a dress for all. Costing \u00a399 full price, handily it\u2019s possible to get 15% off the 4.5 starred outfit using a code available on the website, bringing the total down to \u00a384.15 for savvy shoppers. Long sleeved with a deep v-neck and slightly ruched waist, it comes in a \u2018French\u2019 navy colour with red dots and looks great paired with red heeled boots (like the model) but would also look super chic with flat, brown leather sandals and a basket on holiday.\n\nFor those who aren't a fan of polka dots, there\u2019s the Mint Velvet Navy Polo Jersey Midi Dress - Blue from Very, which is also \u00a399. With a pleated skirt it swishes nicely, and the collar detail makes it suitable for slightly smarter occasions. For \u00a369, Nobody\u2019s Child has the Black Polka Dot Kennedy Midi Dress. This monochrome number is a full button down and would look great with big gold hoops and heels, or with just a denim jacket thrown over the top. One customer said of the Boden dress: \"Great dress. Quite heavy jersey so will be perfect for Autumn. I love a paisley print and the pink and green colour way works well. Good fit and flattering cut.\" A second said: \u201cThis is such a beautiful dress! I love the 'Ivy' style because of the generous length, flattering sleeves and lowish neckline. It's so easy and comfortable to wear. The red pattern looks quite bold on the hanger but once on, it looks very attractive. I can imagine wearing it during the summer for special occasions, as well as for a smart work dress.\u201d A third added: \u201cAnother lovely Boden dress in bold colours. Pattern and style you won't find anywhere else at an affordable price. Very comfy and flattering.\u201d However, one said: \u201cMy absolute favourite dress! Wish it had been available in the petite size, since petite fitted me better (I order several prints), however regular size is OK.\u201d Another flagged: \u201cNice dress, quality fabric and fit. I only buy Boden dresses when they're available in long/tall, as the regular fit is too short all over for me (I'm 5-8). I had to adjust the neck-line a little as it was too low for my taste - buttons would be better, Boden, so we have a choice. I wore it to the races, and it was just the thing!\u201d The Ivy Smocked Midi Dress is available at Boden.",

Instead, we\u2019ve proportionally shortened the length throughout on these garments \u2013 not just at the knee or ankle \u2013 so that they fit and flatter all over. You\u2019ll notice the difference when you try them on.\nIn jumpsuits we also offer a \u2018tall\u2019 size for customers 5ft 10in or over. We\u2019ve not just added extra fabric to the legs but increased the length proportionately throughout the style to ensure a noticeably improved, flattering fit.\nFor our \u2018long\u2019 styles, we\u2019ve added extra length at the bottom, so you can choose where you\u2019d like the hemline to fall and whether you\u2019d like to wear the garment with flats or (hooray) heels.\nFit\nSize\nPre-order\nWe're experiencing some delays.

Instead, we\u2019ve proportionally shortened the length throughout on these garments \u2013 not just at the knee or ankle \u2013 so that they fit and flatter all over. You\u2019ll notice the difference when you try them on.\nIn jumpsuits we also offer a \u2018tall\u2019 size for customers 5ft 10in or over. We\u2019ve not just added extra fabric to the legs but increased the length proportionately throughout the style to ensure a noticeably improved, flattering fit.\nFor our \u2018long\u2019 styles, we\u2019ve added extra length at the bottom, so you can choose where you\u2019d like the hemline to fall and whether you\u2019d like to wear the garment with flats or (hooray) heels.\nFit\nSize\nPre-order\nWe're experiencing some delays.
