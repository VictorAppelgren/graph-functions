  "title": "Alexander Executive Search Redefines Hiring: Why Behavioral Fit Should Outweigh Skills in Building Lasting Teams",
  "description": "Rather than sending resumes alone, Alexander Executive Search provides a comprehensive candidate briefing pack.",
  "content": "Hiring and retaining the right talent is one of today\u2019s most persistent corporate challenges. All too often, organizations default to evaluating objective factors, skills, qualifications, and experience, while giving little importance to the nuances of behavior, motivation, and cultural fit. As Keith Fox, founder of Alexander Executive Search, points out, \u201cPeople are hired on skills and experience and fired on behavior and performance.\u201d\n\nThis misguided focus yields hiring decisions built on resumes rather than people, resulting in mismatches, disillusionment, and churn that weaken both team cohesion and brand reputation.\n\nTraditional recruitment systems, in their emphasis on objective credentials, reduce people to checklists. A candidate may meet the technical job requirements, and a placement would be made, but there would be little assurance that the individual will flourish, much less stay.\n\n\u201cCompanies need to be careful,\u201d Fox notes, \u201cbecause companies with high turnovers can develop negative reputations.\u201d The real cost lies not only in replacing someone who didn\u2019t fit, but in the morale and cultural toll on those left behind.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median employee tenure in US industries hovers around 3.9 years, while voluntary quits remain persistently high. Additionally, turnover costs an estimated 33 percent of a worker\u2019s annual salary to replace a mid-level employee. These figures underscore the importance and urgency of aligning hires with both the role and environment, rather than settling for surface-level factors, and that\u2019s what Fox\u2019s work represents.\n\nFox\u2019s approach at Alexander Executive Search defines a new narrative in hiring, one that restores the focus on the person, not just the paper. Fox says, \u201cWe take measures to ensure employee retention, as well as offer a replacement within the 12-month period.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t luck, it\u2019s evidence that behavior matters more than skills. \u201cSkills are a tick-box exercise,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe thing that gets people to move jobs is behaviors. Someone can be the best in their role, but if the environment doesn\u2019t suit their behaviors, they\u2019ll dissipate into a role they\u2019ll dislike.\u201d\n\nAlexander Executive Search\u2019s methodology embeds behavioral alignment into every phase of the process. Upon partnering, clients gain access to a secure, web-enabled portal, accessible on any device, where they can oversee their assignments in real time. They see each candidate\u2019s status, aligned to job descriptions and key expectations, in an interface designed for clarity and transparency.\n\nRather than sending resumes alone, Alexander Executive Search provides a comprehensive candidate briefing pack. Not only encapsulating job specifications, but also a curated introduction to the hiring company\u2019s philosophies, operations, products, and values. It outlines the process, the retention guarantees, and what\u2019s expected from both sides.\n\nWhat elevates this further is the use of a behavior-focused job survey. Hiring managers complete a multiple-choice tick-box assessment that outlines the behavioral profile required. These profiles are then compared across candidates, producing strategic insights.\n\nEach candidate\u2019s journey is transparent; users can see completion of each hiring stage, including behavioral assessment, submission of a short introduction video, photo upload, resume, and responses to key competency questions. The system even integrates with behavioral assessments, offering behavioral analysis, stress response insights, tailored interview questions, and precise guidance on how to manage the candidate.\n\nBeyond assessment, the portal supports interview scheduling across time zones, collective rating from the hiring team, and side-by-side comparison of how each candidate was received.\n\nFox emphasizes the holistic human element in recruitment. His \u201chead, heart, and mind\u201d approach ensures candidates are engaged intellectually, emotionally, and ethically. \u201cI don\u2019t pitch someone solely on earning more,\u201d he says. Instead, he seeks alignment between what makes the candidate happy and how they\u2019ll contribute meaningfully.\n\nAlexander Executive Search\u2019s sourcing is direct and old-school. Fox doesn\u2019t believe in formal, rudimentary emails and phone calls, and instead enforces an in-person approach. \u201cI\u2019m quite old school,\u201d Fox shares. \u201cI tend to phone them, asking to meet over breakfast.\u201d That personal touch, combined with the behavioral architecture of the portal and process, represents a recruitment system that acknowledges that the real challenge isn\u2019t filling positions, it\u2019s placing people.\n\nThrough headhunting and referencing largely in the civil engineering and construction landscape, the firm has recruited for companies globally, including in the US and Asia.\n\nIn a recruitment ecosystem struggling with low engagement and high turnover, Alexander Executive Search offers a compelling alternative that merges behavioral science with transparent, collaborative processes. By putting human alignment at the heart of hiring, Fox reinstates that the difference between a costly hire and a successful one lies not in experience, but in character.",

      "text": "Dive Brief:\n- Employee Benefit News (EBN) reports that it costs employers 33% of a worker's annual salary to hire a replacement if that worker leaves. In dollar figures, the replacement cost is $15,000 per person for an employee earning a median salary of $45,000 a year, according to the Work Institute\u2019s 2017 Retention Report. The study of 34,000 respondents concluded that 75% of the causes of employee turnover are preventable.\n- The study also highlighted turnover's indirect costs, or \u201cproductivity costs,\u201d says EBN. Indirect costs stem from knowledge lost when employees leave, the time spent finding a replacement and the time new hires need to become fully functional.\n- In exit interviews, the top reasons survey respondents gave for leaving their jobs were career development (22%), work-life balance (12%), managers' behavior (11%), compensation and benefits (9%) and well-being (9%).\nDive Insight:\nA separate Willis Tower Watson survey revealed that one in three hires will leave a job within two years, pressuring employers to find replacements quickly and absorb the high costs involved. This report reaches an interesting conclusion: employers might want to focus on shaping the workplace to fit the best hires instead of selecting people that fit the workplace.\nCareer development is a common reason for dissatisfaction on the job. More employers of all types are turning to employee learning programs to both keep people on the job and improve the quality of their workforce. Job responsibilities that don't meet expectations are another catalyst for turnover. Departing employees most likely had an unrealistic view of the job during the recruitment process, which can be partly solved by improving the language of job listings.\nTo maximize retention, employers need formal, consistent exit interviews. Finding out why people leave is key to finding ways to encourage top performers to stay. Employers also can develop talent pipelines by allowing employees to create networks and make referrals, which narrows the recruiting and hiring time needed to find replacements when workers do leave."

Supporting data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Work Institute, and Willis Tower Watson shows that turnover costs up to 33% of a worker\u2019s salary and that most departures are preventable, often due to misaligned expectations, management behavior, and lack of career development. Fox\u2019s method claims a 96% 12\u2011month retention rate and a replacement policy of up to two years, positioning behavioral science as the key to successful hiring and long\u2011term employee stability.",
