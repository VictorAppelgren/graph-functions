      "feedback": "Your draft covers plausible cross‑asset connections and nods to Jackson Hole, the BoJ path, and geopolitics, but it needs a tighter, multi‑year regime framework and sharper quantification to reach world‑class quality. Actionable edits: (1) restructure into a formal regime matrix aligned to the horizon: invariant anchors (real policy‑rate differentials, BoP/external position, productivity) plus a mapping to regimes (e.g., regime A: policy easing with inflation moderating; regime B: hawkish re‑pricing if inflation sticky; regime C: policy pivot back to tight if growth surprises) with explicit transition conditions anchored to observable triggers (Jackson Hole communications, CPI/jobs data, BoJ moves, China credit impulse). Reference the sources: GX057ADL7 for the Fed/BoJ/yen/yields dynamics and the call for cuts; 37UZC9X8I for the Jackson Hole framing and the near‑term policy expectations; TN66GHPAT for energy/FX and LNG/OP opportunities that could shift the energy/European‑Asia growth channel. (2) tighten the causal chain and transmission channels: state the base mechanism (policy easing → easier financial conditions → lower real yields and a weaker dollar; higher risk appetite supports tech/AI cycles; cross‑asset flows through FX, rates and equities) and tie each step to a source example (e.g., yen‑USD move and BoJ risk in GX057ADL7; Tencent earnings and AI monetization in GX057ADL7). (3) upgrade quantification: embed explicit numbers from sources rather than qualitative statements: include 10‑year yield around 4.20–4.25% (GX057ADL7), USDJPY around 146.5 (GX057ADL7), the priced‑in September cut of 25bp (GX057ADL7), and Bessent’s call for 150–175bp of cuts (GX057ADL7); mention Tencent’s earnings resilience and AI‑spending growth (GX057ADL7); and the IT/AI cycle impact via Bloomberg interview tone (37UZC9X8I). (4) catalysts, triggers, and invalidation: clearly list (a) hawkish CPI surprise or employment strength forcing a policy reset; (b) BoJ divergence (hiking vs lagging) altering cross‑border funding and FX; (c) China credit/household deleveraging turning into a sharper growth scare; (d) geopolitical shocks (DRC sanctions, energy supply news) altering risk premia; (e) AI monetization not translating into productivity. Tie each to a concrete market sign (rates, dollar, yen, equities, commodities). (5) address conflicts and coverage gaps: reconcile the “large cuts” narrative (Bessent’s 50bp‑plus wish) with market pricing (25bp baseline) and acknowledge that Jackson Hole is policy‑signal oriented rather than a rate decision; cite both perspectives and assess probability ranges. (6) strengthen base case and risk grid for a multi‑year view: present a base‑case path (progressive easing with gradual disinflation, gradual equity multiple expansion, or structural AI productivity uptake) plus linear risk weights and clear watch items (CPI, BoJ move, China demand, sanctions). (7) formatting/format constraints: keep the piece scannable with a short opening paragraph of anchors, followed by a regime/trigger section, then a base case, risks, and watch list; ensure every assertion quotes or references an ID from the source set (GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, TN66GHPAT) and avoid detours into non‑core topics. In short, add a principled regime framework, sharpen the causal chain with observable triggers, quantify with sourced numbers, reconcile competing signals, and present a clean, multi‑year base case with a clear risk/monitoring plan.",
