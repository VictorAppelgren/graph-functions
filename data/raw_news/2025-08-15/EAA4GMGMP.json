  "title": "Giovanni Leoni: Italy\u2019s next great defensive hope is ready to learn from Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool",
  "description": "Leoni's rise has been stratospheric, and he is part of a growing trend of Italian talent seeking fortune and improvement in England",
  "content": "It was winter in the Spanish capital. Fabio Cannavaro was leaving Real Madrid\u2019s training ground when a stranger flagged him down. An autograph hunter, he thought. A piece of paper was produced from a pocket. But there was no pen to apply the accompanying signature.\n\nInstead, he was presented with what turned out to be a business card. Cannavaro saw the red lettering of France Football, the magazine behind the Ballon d\u2019Or. Their reporter asked if he could get in the Italian defender\u2019s car. He was insistent. The vote for that year\u2019s award was happening in real time and a tipping point had been reached.\n\nHe thought Cannavaro was going to win. Cannavaro thought it was a joke.\n\nThis was 2006 and, only a few months earlier, Cannavaro had captained his country to World Cup final glory. Still, he didn\u2019t think much of his chances. Zinedine Zidane\u2019s red card in that final gave him a shot. But a defender had never won the award, given to the world\u2019s best footballer over the previous year (and none have since). Franco Baresi had come second in 1989, Paolo Maldini \u201conly\u201d third in 1994.\n\nBut it was to be different for Cannavaro. During that tournament in Germany, he earned the nickname \u2018The Berlin Wall\u2019.\n\nAs the fourth and, so far, final Italian to collect the Ballon d\u2019Or and the most recent man to skipper the country\u2019s national team to victory at a World Cup, Cannavaro is often asked about Italy\u2019s travails. Why have they gone from winning the greatest tournament of all to not even qualifying for the finals in 2018 and 2022?\n\nOn some occasions, he has been critical: Italy has lost itself. It has tried to be different when it does not need to be ashamed of its football DNA. In others, he has been more diplomatic: football is cyclical and, sooner or later, a new generation will bring renewed competitiveness.\n\nGiovanni Leoni, the Parma centre-back on his way to Liverpool for an initial \u00a326million ($35.3m), was born less than a month after Cannavaro was presented with the Ballon d\u2019Or in November 2006, so he is too young to have seen him in his prime.\n\nAged only three when Italy\u2019s defence of their title ended in a bottom-of-the-table and winless group-stage exit from South Africa 2010 (a point below New Zealand), he was seven when they made it to their most recent World Cup in Brazil, again going out after three first-phase games, beating England but losing to Uruguay and Costa Rica.\n\nIn truth, producing defenders such as Leoni has never been an issue for Italy in the meantime. It\u2019s the Baggios, Tottis, Vieris and Del Pieros they have lacked.\n\nLeoni, who after only 14 starts in Serie A is already being hastily talked about as a future captain of Italy, grew up in the era of the BBC defence \u2014 Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Barzagli and Giorgio Chiellini \u2014 at Juventus. They have been succeeded by Alessandro Bastoni and a late bloomer in Francesco Acerbi as a pair at Inter. It has been a time of European Championship finals lost (2012) and won (2021) and Italian back lines being the bedrock of Champions League runners-up in 2015, 2017, 2023 and 2025.\n\nOnly one of those great centre-backs played outside of Italy going into their peak years.\n\nThe reason for that is quite simple. For many Italians, it doesn\u2019t get any bigger than playing for one of their country\u2019s big three. Few stages are greater than San Siro. Few clubs, historically, guarantee you success like Juventus. Cannavaro, for instance, only moved to Madrid on the back of that World Cup, the Calciopoli scandal and Juventus\u2019 subsequent relegation. Chiellini and Bonucci departed Turin in their twilight years for experiences in Los Angeles (for Chiellini) and Berlin then Istanbul.\n\nThe exception is Barzagli, and it\u2019s Barzagli to whom one Italian sporting director, speaking on the condition of anonymity, compares Leoni.\n\nA squad player at that 2006 World Cup and a member of the Wolfsburg team that upset the odds to win the German Bundesliga three years later, the Tuscan heart-throb, now a pundit and wine-maker, was Andrea Agnelli\u2019s favourite signing throughout his chairmanship of Juventus \u2014 and not just because he cost as little as \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3258,000; $350,000 at the curent rates) in January 2011.\n\nChiellini and Bonucci were already at the club when Barzagli arrived a few months before his 30th birthday. Juventus were floundering, finishing seventh for a second season running, and wouldn\u2019t start a nine-year Scudetto winning streak until Antonio Conte was appointed and Andrea Pirlo arrived from Milan on a free that summer.\n\nBut within Juventus, Barzagli continues to be recognised as a foundational piece. He is lesser spotted than Chiellini and Bonucci, and yet both credit him with making them better centre-backs. Both bow to him. When Barzagli retired in 2019, Juventus\u2019 manager at the time, Max Allegri, called him \u201cthe professor of defenders\u201d. It chimed nicely with Jose Mourinho\u2019s comment about the club being the Harvard of defending.\n\nAnd so for Leoni to draw comparisons with Barzagli at only 18 is no faint praise.\n\nIt is rare for the big three in Italy to let a talent like him get away, and perhaps there is a parallel to be drawn with Marco Verratti here. Paris Saint-Germain gazumped Juventus in 2012 and Verratti, then a 19-year-old at second-division Pescara, never looked back.\n\nIs that what\u2019s happening with Leoni?\n\nOn the one hand, the powerlessness to stop his move reflects the financial state of Serie A and the gulf in spending power between Italy\u2019s elite and their English peers. Serie A clubs have spent \u20ac860million (\u00a3742m; $1bn) gross so far this summer. A fair amount. Premier League teams, though, have cut cheques for nearly \u20ac2.4bn\u2026\n\nAt the same time, better choices could have been made by the domestic candidates for Leoni\u2019s signature. For example, the commitment made by Juventus\u2019 old sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli to sign Lloyd Kelly from Newcastle is one to rue. In that they only have themselves to blame.\n\nOn the other hand, England is no longer the road less travelled for Italian players. It is more and more the direction of travel, especially for the young. If, like Leoni, Cannavaro had been playing for Parma in 2025 instead of 2002, his next move would probably have been to the Premier League, not Inter.\n\nThe financial pull is too great but, regardless of the economics at play, it is where up-and-coming Italians are being encouraged to test themselves. When champions Italy were eliminated from Euro 2024 at the round-of-16 stage last summer, their coach at the time, Luciano Spalletti, said if the opportunity presents itself to go abroad, particularly to England, then Italians need to seize it. They\u2019ll be better for it, he argued, such is the standard and competitiveness.\n\nFlash forward 13 months and the Premier League has never been able to count on so many. Sandro Tonali, Riccardo Calafiori, Federico Chiesa, Michael Kayode, Luca Koleosho, Wilfried Gnonto, Diego Coppola, Guglielmo Vicario, Destiny Udogie. Maybe Gianluigi Donnarumma soon.\n\nThis should be a source of optimism in their homeland.\n\nKayode, who got the only goal of the final when Italy won the Under-19 Euros two years ago, was an under-the-radar signing by Brentford from Fiorentina on an initial loan in January. Coppola, a 21-year-old who plays the same position as Leoni, has been picked up this summer by Brighton. Both signing clubs are renowned for talent identification.\n\nAs for Liverpool, well, their reputation in that regard precedes them.\n\nLeoni\u2019s rise, it must be said, has been stratospheric \u2014 so rapid, he has played just eight times for Italy at youth levels. He is the son of a banker and a physiotherapist, who both played water polo to a high level. One of his brothers, Edoardo, has followed in their wet footsteps and also competes in that sport in Italy\u2019s second division. A sporty family, they fostered a basketball player, Mahamadou Diarra, who made it onto their local professional team, Petrarca.\n\nLeoni is their only footballer. He made his debut for Padova, then in the third tier, at 16, showing himself to be even more precocious than Alessandro Del Piero, the future Italy great who came through at the same club as a teenager in the very early 1990s.\n\nOne of Leoni\u2019s role models around then was Smalldini. No, not Paolo Maldini, who he never saw play. For the uninitiated, \u2018Smalldini\u2019 is the nickname bestowed upon Chris Smalling during the Englishman\u2019s head-anything-that-comes-into-the-box phase with Roma at the start of this decade. The other? One of his new team-mates at Anfield, a certain Virgil van Dijk.\n\nEven amid their current dysfunction, Sampdoria spotted Leoni early and snapped him up in February last year. Pirlo, their coach at the time, quickly brought him into a promotion-chasing first team where Leoni, benefiting from some injuries to more senior players, partnered 22-year-old Daniele Ghilardi. Although Sampdoria didn\u2019t go up that summer, Leoni and Ghilardi did. One joining Parma, the other Verona. Ghilardi played more regularly last season, next to the aforementioned Coppola. They clocked up more than 2,000 Serie A minutes each; Leoni, by contrast, scraped to just over a thousand in 17 appearances.\n\nFor now, Coppola is the only one of them to have been capped at senior level, but neither of the Verona duo made the impression Leoni did when he established himself in the Parma team under Fabio Pecchia, then stayed here when Cristian Chivu took over in February. Leoni stood out for defending one-v-one and winning duels in big open spaces.\n\nSuch was the impression he made in a short space of time, it came as no surprise when Chivu, a former centre-back himself, expressed his desire to bring the kid with him to Inter, where he replaced Simone Inzaghi there earlier this summer.\n\nWhile Leoni can improve in terms of guile and edge in his own penalty area, the prevailing sense is that he has what it takes to partner Bastoni at international level in the near future. No doubt, the likes of Arsenal\u2019s Calafiori and Alessandro Buongiorno at Napoli will have something to say about that. Both of them, unfortunately for them, are injury-prone. Leoni, so far, is not.\n\nIn moving to Liverpool, the talented teenager addresses both immediate and long-term needs; a combination that perhaps makes it the ideal time and place for him to develop and learn from one of his heroes, a now 34-year-old Van Dijk.\n\nLeoni means Lions in Italian. It is a surname that calls to mind one of the most famous (now defunct) ultras groups in Italy, the Fossa dei Leoni at Milan, which translates as The Lions\u2019 Den.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see if that\u2019s what Liverpool\u2019s penalty area becomes in the Leoni era: a place to fear, a place nobody gets near.",

  "summary": "Italian footballer Fabio Cannavaro, known as the fourth and final Italian to win the Ballon d\u2019Or and the most recent man to captain the country\u2019s national team to victory at a World Cup, is often asked about Italy's struggles, which have seen them drop from winning the greatest tournament of all to not even qualifying for the finals in 2018 and 2022. The article suggests that while producing defenders like Giovanni Leoni has never been an issue for Italy, the country has lacked the quality of defensive players. Leoni, who was signed from Parma for an initial \u00a326m ($35.3m), is expected to be considered a future captain of Italy. Cannavararo, who has previously captained his country to victory in the World Cup final, was born less than a month after he was presented with the award.",

      "text": "Fabio Capello didn\u2019t stick around.\nThe Calciopoli trial had not yet delivered a verdict but the writing was on the wall. A break clause in his contract with Juventus gave him a get-out and, on July 4, 2006, he exercised it. Capello was recognised as football\u2019s leading coach at the time. He had won eight league titles in 15 years. His past as a player with Juventus did not, however, make him unconditionally loyal.\nAdvertisement\nWhen the club were relegated to Serie B for the first time in their history, docked an initial 30 points and stripped of the two championships he\u2019d won (2004-05, 2005-06), Capello was already back in Valdebebas, a second spell with Real Madrid underway. Fabio Cannavaro, the World Cup and soon-to-be Ballon d\u2019Or-winning centre-back, followed him to the Bernabeu along with Emerson, the Brazilian twine running through Capello\u2019s last Scudetti at Roma and Juve.\nThe scandal, which led to lifetime bans for Juventus\u2019 general manager Luciano Moggi and chief executive Antonio Giraudo, was not about match-fixing, but rather a network of power and influence. It remains a bitterly disputed watershed moment in the history of Italian football, a forever war, which brings us to Juventus\u2019 opponents in the Champions League on Wednesday night, Manchester City.\nTo paraphrase the opening line from Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina (all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way), the 115 charges brought by the Premier League against City are different from the allegations the Italian Football Federation made against Juventus and others in 2006.\nCity welcomed \u201cthe review by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence\u201d they claim will exonerate them from charges that include a failure to provide accurate details for player and manager payments, breaches of profit and sustainability rules (PSR) and compliance with UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations.\nNevertheless, in the worst-case scenario for City, the outcome might resemble what Juventus reckoned with almost two decades ago. Pep Guardiola has repeatedly addressed the threat of relegation. \u201cI said when all the clubs accused us of doing something wrong and people say: \u2018What if we are relegated?\u2019 I will be here. I don\u2019t know the position they are going to bring us, the Conference? (But) next year we will come up and come up and come back to the Premier League.\u201d\nWhether Guardiola\u2019s promise is tested by the verdict or not remains to be seen. The Athletic broke the news of his contract extension last month, a testament to his enduring confidence in the club. How the players would react to a still hypothetical relegation is another unknown. As was the case with Capello, who still considers Calciopoli a \u201ccomic\u201d injustice. He thought the punishment was \u201cover the top\u201d and continues to recognise the two revoked titles, as the players involved do, as won sul campo (on the pitch). Zlatan Ibrahimovic thought \u201cmost of it\u201d was \u201cbullshit\u201d. \u201cReferees giving us preferential treatment?\u201d he sounded off in his book. \u201cCome on! We\u2019d struggled hard out there. We\u2019d risked our necks and didn\u2019t have any damn referees in our pockets \u2014 no way!\u201d\nAdvertisement\nStill, it didn\u2019t stop the Swede from wanting out. He looked at Juventus as a \u201csinking ship\u201d with Lilian Thuram and Gianluca Zambrotta jumping overboard for Barcelona, Cannavaro and Emerson for Real Madrid. \u201cAll the rest of us who were still left were ringing our agents, saying: \u2018Sell us, sell us. What prospects are out there?\u2019\u201d\nCapello\u2019s replacement Didier Deschamps told Ibrahimovic he\u2019d quit if the striker left. \u201c\u2019Okay, pack your bags and I\u2019ll ring for a taxi,\u2019 I said, and he laughed, as if I was joking,\u201d Ibrahimovic recalled. He was 25, a year older than Erling Haaland is now, a player with whom he shared the late Mino Raiola as agent and Ibrahimovic wasn\u2019t prepared to waste one year of his career in the second division and at least two outside the Champions League. \u201cIf you offered me \u20ac20m (a year \u2014 \u00a316.5m/$21.1m at current rates) to stay, I wouldn\u2019t be interested,\u201d Ibrahimovic told Juventus\u2019 incoming CEO Jean-Claude Blanc, who currently sits on the board at Manchester United as part of his remit as head of Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s INEOS Sport.\nThe rush to judgment on Juventus \u2014 the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) took just two months and 12 days to bring proceedings to a close \u2014 remains a sore point. By contrast, it is almost two years since the Premier League announced that its investigation into City had escalated into 115 charges. \u201cTiming and rules were not respected,\u201d Capello said in an interview with Corriere della Sera. \u201cSporting justice wasn\u2019t given the chance to operate correctly.\u201d In a later legal claim, Giraudo felt Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated as he and his lawyers were given only seven days to prepare their defences, an insufficient time for reading a dossier of more than 7,000 pages.\nCapello thought Guido Rossi, the special commissioner appointed by the FIGC to lead the case, \u201cacted too hastily\u201d. For a summer, Guido became the most famous Rossi in Italy, only far more controversial than Paolo, the 1982 World Cup winner. He still is on the internet forums and threads that won\u2019t move on from Calciopoli.\nRossi\u2019s suitability for the role of special commissioner, given his past on Inter\u2019s board between 1995 and 1999, was debated at the time and has been ever since. It has nourished conspiracy theories. In what felt like the latest in an ever-increasing series of echoes of mid-2000s Serie A in contemporary Premier League life, English football got a slight taste for the kind of frenzy this produced when City fans found out that Murray Rosen KC, the lawyer overseeing the Premier League panel looking into the club\u2019s alleged breaches, is an Arsenal supporter.\nAmid signalling from UEFA that they would like everything wrapped up by July 28 so the governing body and competition promoter knew the identity of the Italian teams participating in their competitions the following season, Juventus\u2019 initial relegation and 30-point deduction was confirmed earlier that week, only the penalty was reduced, on appeal, to 17 points and would, in October, be commuted to nine.\nAdvertisement\nMore poisonous was the decision to leave one of Juventus\u2019 two revoked titles unassigned and award the other from 2005-06 to Inter. \u201cA lot of time has passed since Calciopoli,\u201d Giorgio Chiellini reflected in his memoir. \u201cI can only reiterate that those two titles were won on the pitch, simply because we were better, even if laying claim to them now is a losing battle. I am convinced that not even Inter, who finished third that (2005-06) season, feel it as one of their own; it was a mistake to assign it over the table, it would have been better not to give it to anyone.\u201d\nThat the Italian sporting justice system did so set a precedent. Jose Mourinho has had two spells in Italy; one with Inter, the other with Roma. He likes to hit a nerve. Upon inheriting an Inter team that found its principal rivals defanged by Calciopoli, Mourinho brought up the scandal when it suited him and joked that the penalty area was bigger for Juventus than everyone else in Italy. One of the most iconic moments in Inter\u2019s treble-winning season in 2010 came when he made a famous handcuff gesture during a 0-0 draw with Samp to suggest the establishment was doing everything \u2014 his team were down to nine men at the time \u2014 to stop them.\nIt has hardly come as a surprise, then, to hear Mourinho bring up City\u2019s 115 charges, as he did, in defence of his record at Man United when his old club travelled to Istanbul to play his latest team, Fenerbahce, during the autumn. \u201cAs you know, we won the Europa League (in 2017) and we finished second in the Premier League (in 2018),\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI think we still have a chance to win that league because maybe they punish Man City with points and maybe we win that league and then they have to pay me the bonus and give me the medal.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nExplained: If Manchester City are punished will clubs face big bonus bills?\nOnly last week, Mourinho couldn\u2019t resist another comment on the back of City losing to Liverpool at Anfield, the chants of sacked in the morning and Guardiola gesturing six to signify the number of Premier Leagues he has won in England. \u201cGuardiola won six trophies and I won three, but I won fairly and cleanly. If I lost, I want to congratulate my opponent for being better than me. I don\u2019t want to win by dealing with 150 lawsuits.\u201d Whether this is the continued Mourinho-ification of the Premier League discourse from afar or something new \u2014 the Serie A-fication of it \u2014 is blurry.\nUpon relegation in 2006, Juventus fell from third in the Deloitte Money League (where they narrowly trailed Real Madrid and Barcelona) to 12th. Revenue fell by \u20ac106million (42 per cent) as commercial partners like Nike renegotiated their contracts to reflect Juventus\u2019 fall in status. Never outside the top five in Deloitte\u2019s rankings up until then, Juventus have never been back.\nSome of that is systemic. Domestic TV rights in Italy went from being negotiated on an individual basis, guaranteeing the big clubs huge chunks of broadcast revenue, to a collective bargaining process. The league wasn\u2019t as commercially-minded as the Premier League and didn\u2019t sell itself abroad as aggressively, which is one of the explanations for the wealth chasm between England and not only Italy but the rest of Europe.\nThings would have been worse for Juventus had Blanc not followed through on existing plans to build a new stadium on the site of the old Stadio Delle Alpi, which became a major revenue driver in the context of Italian football where the infrastructures of Juventus\u2019 rivals are old and council-owned. That they came back shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted.\nIt took time (and the rise of Andrea Agnelli to the chairmanship) for the Bianconeri to reassert themselves as Italy\u2019s most successful domestic team. Once they did, the sense of revenge within an Old Lady scorned was so strong it gives a sense to the relentless drive behind a record nine consecutive league titles. Juventus were making up for seasons and titles lost.\nAdvertisement\nReturning to the subject of a hypothetical relegation, Guardiola recently said: \u201cSeventy-five per cent of the (Premier League) clubs want it, because I know what they do behind the scenes and this sort of stuff.\u201d Were it to come to pass, it would interesting to see how City\u2019s global and regional partners might react bearing in mind, as detailed in this special report by The Athletic in 2022, the extent to which the club are still dependent on sponsors with business links to the country of their principal owners, Abu Dhabi. Juventus\u2019 majority shareholders, EXOR, the holding company of the Agnelli family, has broad shoulders with a market cap of more than \u20ac20billion. Often likened to Italy\u2019s Kennedys, the Agnellis are not, however, a royal family running a gulf state.\nThe decision of the independent panel, when it comes, will be pored over and scrutinised like no other in Premier League history. Bouncing back from relegation at the first attempt and returning to the Champions League after their first season in Serie A did not mean bygones were bygones. When Andrea Agnelli, the cousin of EXOR chairman and family scion John Elkann, became president of Juventus in 2010, he left the distinct impression the club hadn\u2019t defended itself hard enough during the Calciopoli hearings. He proudly recognised the two revoked titles in their roll of honour and in displays at the Allianz Stadium.\nAs anyone who studied Juventus\u2019 accounts, specifically item 54 (the \u2018Relevant Pending Disputes\u2019 section) during Agnelli\u2019s 12-year tenure knows, Juventus filed an appeal in November 2011 before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court requesting that the (FIGC) be ordered to pay compensation for \u201cthe damage suffered due to the illegitimate exercise of administrative activity and the failure to exercise mandatory activity, in relation to the administrative measures adopted by the FIGC relating to the awarding of the title \u201cItalian Champion\u201d to F.C. Internazionale Milano S.p.A. for the 2005/2006 football championship.\u201d\nJuventus wanted Inter stripped of the 2005-06 title, the Scudetto from that year to go unassigned like the 2004-05 one, and \u201cthe equivalent of the payment of \u20ac443,725,200.00, plus legal interest from the date of the claim up until the final balance\u201d in damages. That pursuit only ended, under a new Juventus board, in October 2023.\nBy that time, Agnelli had left the club. He formalised his resignation at a shareholders assembly in spring 2023 (he and the entire board had announced they would step down in late 2022), amid an investigation into cross-party-transactions (player trading commonly regarded as swap deals) and the way the club structured wage payments during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe federal prosecutor of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) had lost an initial case into player trading and failed in an appeal but then, in early 2023, it got the appeal revoked on the grounds of new evidence gathered in a separate criminal case into the financial affairs of a club listed on the Milan stock exchange. Juventus denied any wrongdoing but were deducted 15 points, which was later suspended and then reduced to 10 in May 2023, resulting in them finishing seventh in Serie A that season. Agnelli was given a two-year ban from Italian football, and there was a 30-month ban for Fabio Paratici, the club\u2019s former sporting director, who at that point was managing director of football at Tottenham. The hearings into the criminal case that sparked the re-opening of the sporting case have only now started to get underway in Rome.\nAt the assembly in which Agnelli left his position (in early 2023), the former general manager Moggi sensationally appeared waving a USB stick. \u201cIf it\u2019s true they have reopened the plusvalenze case because they think they have found new elements,\u201d he said, \u201cit is equally true that we should reopen Calciopoli, a wound that still does not heal for either us or Juventus.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMoggi\u2019s gift \u2014 he wrapped the USB up and stuck a bow on it \u2014 came while Giraudo, another member of the triad of executives who ran Juventus between 1994 and 2006 (the other member was Roberto Bettega) was going from the European Court of Human Rights to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court to challenge the Italian sporting justice system\u2019s status and compatibility with EU law (that was deemed inadmissible due to lack of jurisdiction).\nThe hatchet, if buried, is never in anything other than a shallow grave when it comes to Calciopoli. Closure has been fleeting, illusory. The Premier League and City must hope, whatever the independent panel decides, that this is nipped in the bud once and for all and doesn\u2019t have a similarly long and poisonous tail.\n(Photos: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)"

  "argos_summary": "The piece traces Fabio Cannavaro\u2019s historic 2006 Ballon d\u2019Or win and reflects on Italy\u2019s fluctuating defensive fortunes, highlighting the emergence of young centre\u2011backs such as Giovanni Leoni who has just moved to Liverpool. It contrasts Leoni\u2019s rapid rise with the broader Italian football landscape, noting the country\u2019s struggle to field competitive defenders beyond the traditional \u201cbig three\u201d clubs and the growing trend of Italian talent moving to the Premier League. The article also revisits the Calciopoli scandal that devastated Juventus, detailing the club\u2019s relegation, point deductions, and long\u2011running legal battles, while drawing parallels to Manchester City\u2019s current 115\u2011charge investigation. Together, the narrative underscores how past controversies and shifting player pathways continue to shape Italian football\u2019s identity and its relationship with European competitions.",
