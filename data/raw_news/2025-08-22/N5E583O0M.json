  "title": "A 'West Marches-style' game could make for Critical Role's most interesting campaign yet",
  "description": "What is West Marches, anyway?",
  "content": "Critical Role has announced that the much-anticipated Campaign Four, starting on Oct. 2, 2025, will be its most ambitious ever, bringing together 13 players on three different gaming tables for a West Marches-style campaign led by Game Master Brennan Lee Mulligan, taking over from Matt Mercer, who will finally be stepping in as a full-time player. However, fans who are not familiar with the intricacies of tabletop role-playing games may be wondering what, exactly, a \"West Marches-style\" campaign is.\n\nWest Marches is the name of a long-running game created by Ben Robbins, the game designer who also created Microscope and Kingdom. West Marches started with a similar premise to the iconic The Keep on the Borderlands D&D module: A fortified town is the last safe outpost at the edge of civilization, and beyond that extends a wilderness ripe with dangers and opportunities for adventurers. The players start from the town and explore the wilderness with no prompts, quests, or input from the Game Master, creating a true sandbox experience. At the end of every session, they go back to the town, waiting for the next expedition.\n\nThe premise of the West Marches game was that there was no regular time; every session was scheduled by players based on their availability. (This obviously won't be applied to Critical Role's campaign.) There was also no regular party. Robbins had a large pool of players (between 10 and 14), so the group at the table would vary depending on who was available on a specific day. According to Robbins, this setup helped deal with some of the recurring issues a TTRPG group faces: \"My motivation in setting things up this way was to overcome player apathy and mindless 'plot following' by putting the players in charge of both scheduling and what they did in-game. A secondary goal was to make the schedule adapt to the complex lives of adults. Ad hoc scheduling and a flexible roster meant (ideally) people got to play when they could but didn\u2019t hold up the game for everyone else if they couldn\u2019t. If you can play once a week, that\u2019s fine. If you can only play once a month, that\u2019s fine too.\"\n\nEvery regular TTRPG player knows that even the destructive might of the Tarrasque pales in comparison to the real ultimate monster: conflicting schedules. Still, that's hardly a problem that the Critical Role crew has to deal with, so why are they choosing a West Marches style for Campaign Four? Because of everything else that this approach implies. In Robbins' game, each player attended, on average, a third of the sessions. Information sharing was, thus, essential. Players not only shared tales of their daring exploits with each other, but every party left behind info about the locations they explored on a shared map carved on a large table in the taproom of the local inn. Together with the sandbox aspect, this meant that the world of West Marches grew organically as the players explored it. According to Robbins, this meant that, while there was no plot, \"there was history and interconnected details. Tidbits found in one place could shed light elsewhere. Instead of just being an interesting detail, these clues lead to concrete discoveries.\"\n\nThis aspect will be crucial for Critical Role's Campaign Four, set in the brand-new world of Aram\u00e1n, created by Mulligan. Every Game Master who has tried their hand at a homebrew campaign knows how challenging it is to create a world from scratch. Sure, it's possible to fill hundreds of pages with lore, locations, history, and characters (Robbins also said that the West Marches territory had to be, by necessity, very detailed), but that doesn't mean the world will feel alive to the players. However, having that world grow and take shape from their discoveries and their choices will create that kind of magical storytelling that Critical Role fans crave. As the players discover more about the world of Aram\u00e0n, so will the spectators at home.\n\nFinally, a West Marches style will also allow for a high number of players in the campaign (13 have been confirmed in the announcement) without having to cram them all at the same table. They will be divided into three groups \u2014 the Soldiers, the Schemers, and the Seekers \u2014 and that's the most intriguing aspect to me. If Mulligan and the others want to take full advantage of this setup, the groups won't have separate adventures that will intersect periodically in special sessions. True to the West March style, each group's actions and discoveries should have an impact on the other tables, creating the feeling of a world that is changing in real time. It will be interesting to see if they will work together and share information, and how \u2014 perhaps picking up the idea of the carved table map from the original West Marches.\n\nThere is a lot more to West Marches, which its creator described as \"designed to be pretty much the diametric opposite of the normal weekly game.\" If you want to learn more about Robbins' game and how you can apply these ideas to your own, I suggest checking his blog, or the great explanation by Matthew Colville you can watch below. It was a revolutionary idea that influenced TTRPGs for decades, and it's now being brought to the brightest stage in the industry.",

      "text": "The Keep on the Borderlands is probably the most iconic and well known of the Dungeons & Dragons modules by TSR, the original publisher of the game created by Gary Gygax, who also authored this module. Designed to be an introduction for new dungeon masters and players, B2 \u2014 modules from that time followed a nomenclature; this one stands for second module in the Basics series \u2014 stood the test of time with enduring popularity. That\u2019s further proven by the recently announced new starter set for Dungeons & Dragons 5e, Heroes of the Borderlands, which borrows the setting and some of the vibes from B2.\nBut why has The Keep on the Borderlands remained so appreciated for over 46 years? In 1979, B2 became the module included in the Holmes D&D\u2019s Basic Set, replacing B1, In Search of the Unknown (due to a legal dispute between D&D co-creators Gygax and Dave Anderson). B2 remained the included module in the wildly successful Moldvay Basic Set, which began circulation in 1981 and sold nearly 1.3 million copies. Basically, if someone started playing D&D during the late \u201970s or the early \u201980s, they probably started their journey in The Keep.\nIt can\u2019t just be nostalgia, though. B2\u2019s excellent design allowed it to remain a popular starting module for several generations of players. While this is a module written for first-time DMs to run, it\u2019s not particularly linear. Rather, it\u2019s a mini-sandbox adventure, where the heroes make their base in the namesake Keep, and from there they can explore nearby locations, including the famous dungeon complex of the Caves of Chaos. The borderlands where the Keep stands function as a liminal space between the civilized lands and the wilderness, offering a chance for adventure in a setting that feels ripe with opportunities and secrets, without the risk of appearing overwhelming to new players like most campaign settings would.\nThe Keep functions as the archetypal fantasy village or town that can be encountered in almost every D&D adventure: It has a tavern, an inn, shops and traders, a bank, a guildhouse, a chapel, henchmen to hire, and a ruling class to woo or antagonize. Outside, in the wilderness, lie the Caves of Chaos, 11 cave complexes of varying size and complexity overlooking a steep ravine. At the back of the ravine lies the Shrine to Evil Chaos (yes, it\u2019s evil and chaotic!) where players will find the hardest challenge of the module. (Spoiler: It\u2019s undead. Lots of undead.) Another interesting element is that, while the caves are designed to be of increasing difficulty the deeper they are in the ravine, the players can enter any of the complexes at any time. If they are too bold, or too unlucky, they will stumble into perils they can\u2019t overcome, which is unusual for a starter module.\nFrom a modern perspective, B2 could easily look like a lazily designed module, lacking complexity and details in many of its parts. The Caves of Chaos, for example, are home to many tribes of monstrous humanoids: Kobolds, Goblins, Orcs, Hobgoblins, Bugbears, and more. This is meant to offer players increasingly strong enemies to fight, but the module never dwells on the ecosystem of the Caves or the relationship between the different tribes, or how they came to serve the Evil Chaos. There is a mention of two of the tribes forming an alliance, and of one stealing from the other, but it\u2019s an ephemeral lore drop, similar to the \u201cpoints of interest\u201d that are scattered in the wilderness around the Caves.\nThat, I believe, is the strength of The Keep on the Borderlands, and the reason it managed to stay so popular that, 46 years later, D&D is going back to it for its next starter set. As a DM who mostly runs published modules or campaigns, I can say that it\u2019s a complex experience. It\u2019s great to have the table set for you, with the locations mapped out, the encounters planned, and a plot already penned. However, we are all creatives; otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be doing this. We always want to bring our input into these modules, expand them, and leave our imprint on these pre-constructed worlds. B2 has been allowing DMs to do that for 46 years.\nIt sets up a little region with a good-sized town in the middle (the Keep), which can be developed together by the DM and the players as they adventure through it. The setting is remote and liminal by design, so there are no assumptions about the world around it. It has a dungeon for the group\u2019s hack-and-slash and XP-gathering needs that is complex in its entirety but simple if broken down into its base elements, which can be explored separately, allowing for breathing room between delves. The Keep itself provides the type of structure, opportunities, and intrigue that can usually be found in the big, sprawling cities that are common in D&D settings, such as Greyhawk or Waterdeep, but on a much smaller scale.\nEssentially, The Keep on the Borderlands has everything that new players may expect from D&D, and it leaves enough holes to fill that every run of the module will always feel personal and unique.\nI\u2019m not sure how much of that experience will be recaptured in Heroes of the Borderlands, which seems tailored to appeal to board game players with quick-start rules and plenty of accessories. However, the fact that Dungeons & Dragons is revisiting the setting of B2 (and not for the first time: There was a sequel for 2nd edition AD&D in 1999, and a re-release for D&D 4e in 2010) is significant. Arguably, D&D reached the apex of its popularity in the \u201980s. In recent years, the game has been able to recapture that level of success thanks to the mainstream exposure coming from Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things and actual play shows such as Critical Role. Bridging almost half a century, The Keep on the Borderlands stands as a testament to the magic that can only be created at a D&D table."

      "text": "Grand Experiments: West Marches (part 2), Sharing Info\nPlayers sharing information was a critical part of the West Marches design. Because there was a large pool of players, the average person was in about a third of the games \u2014 or to look it the other way, each player missed two-thirds of the games. Add in that each player was in a random combination of sessions (not even playing with a consistent subset of players) and pretty quickly each player is seeing a unique fraction of the game. No one is having the same game experience, which sounds philosophically interesting but is bad news if you want everyone to feel like they are in the same game. Sharing info was essential to keeping everyone on the same page and in the same game.\nThere were two main ways information got shared: game summaries and the shared map.\nShared Experience: Game Summaries\nPlayers were strongly encouraged to chat about their adventures between games. Email (specifically a list devoted to the game) made between-game communication very easy, something that would have been next to impossible years earlier. This discussion theoretically mirrored chatter between characters who had made it safely back to the town. Did you stumble into the barrow mounds in Wil Wood and barely escape with your life? Warn other adventurers so they can steer clear. Did you slay wolves on the moors until the snow was red with blood? Brag about it so everyone else knows how tough you are.\nWhat started off as humble anecdotes evolved into elaborate game summaries, detailed stories written by the players recounting each adventure (or misadventure). Instead of just sharing information and documenting discoveries (\u201cwe found ancient standing stones north of the Golden Hills\u201d), game summaries turned into tributes to really great (and some really tragic) game sessions, and eventually became a creative outlet in their own right. Players enjoyed writing them and players enjoyed reading them, which kept players thinking about the game even when they weren\u2019t playing.\nShared World: the Table Map\nThe other major way information was shared was the table map. When the game first started the PCs heard a rumor that years ago when other adventurers had tried their luck exploring the West Marches, they had sat in the taproom of the Axe & Thistle to compare notes. While trying to describe an area of the wilds, a few thirsty patrons had scratched out a simple map on the top of the table (an X here, a line here). Over time others started adding bits, cleaning it up, and before long it had grown from some scratches to a detailed map carved into most of the surface of the table showing forests, creeks, caves, ominous warnings, etc. Where was that table now? Gone, but no one was sure where \u2014 maybe carried off as a souvenir, smashed in a brawl and used for kindling, or perhaps just thrown out after it was too scratched to rest a drink flatly.\nOn hearing this story the PCs immediately decided to revive the tradition (just as I hoped they would) and started to carve their own crude map on a large table in the taproom of the Axe & Thistle. As the campaign went on all the PCs would gather around it, quaff an ale, and plan adventures. In the real world it was a single sheet of graph paper with the town and the neighboring areas drawn in pretty well, and then about four or five more pieces of graph paper taped on haphazardly whenever someone wandered off the edge or explored just a little bit farther. Because the map was in a public place and any PC could get to it, I brought it to every game session for the PCs to add to or edit and kept a reasonably up-to-date scanned copy on the web for reference between games. In the end maybe half a dozen different players had put their hand to it.\nWas the table map accurate? Not really, but having a common reference point, a shared sense of what they thought the region looked like kept everyone feeling like they were playing in the same world.\n\u2026\nAn intentional side effect of both game summaries and the shared map was that they whetted people\u2019s appetite to play. When people heard about other players finding the Abbots\u2019 study in a hidden room of the ruined monastery, or saw on the map that someone else had explored beyond Centaur Grove, it made them want to get out there and play too. Soon they were scheduling their own game sessions. Like other aspects of West Marches it was a careful allowance of competitiveness and even jealously to encourage more gaming.\nIt was also important to me as a GM that players share knowledge because otherwise I knew that no one would put the pieces together. Remember how I said there was no plot? There wasn\u2019t. But there was history and interconnected details. Tidbits found in one place could shed light elsewhere. Instead of just being interesting detail, these clues lead to concrete discoveries if you paid attention. If you deciphered the runes in the depths of the dwarven mines, you could learn that the exiles established another hidden fortress in the valleys to the north. Now go look for it. Or maybe you\u2019ll learn how to get past the Black Door or figure out what a \u201ctreasure beyond bearing\u201d actually is. Put together the small clues hidden all across the map and you can uncover the big scores, the secret bonus levels.\nNext up: West Marches (part 3) Recycling\nLeave a reply\n[\u2026] too, but I intend to flesh that out more as the campaign goes on. I\u2019ve been reading up on West Marches campaigns and I really like the idea that it can be really valuable to your group to keep a record, but it [\u2026]\n[\u2026] up to the players to collect and collate their information. And there\u2019s probably a lot of it. The Ars Ludi blog discusses the importance of this, however back when they ran their game they used email lists. Which is peak 2007. We, however, live [\u2026]\n[\u2026] PERO, en mi caso, en realidad no quiero DIRIGIR una partida usando un mapa de hex\u00e1gonos desde el punto de vista del jugador. Quiero que los jugadores tengan m\u00e1s la sensaci\u00f3n de estar orient\u00e1ndose por puntos de referencia sobre el terreno, encontrando puntos de inter\u00e9s y viajando de uno a otro porque la orientaci\u00f3n visual es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil que dirigirse directamente al destino final, algo similar a la campa\u00f1a de las West Marches de Ben Robbins (ver el comentario #7 aqu\u00ed). [\u2026]\n[\u2026] I do plan on recording the adventures, so people not playing may be able to learn what happens. It may also be streamed by various people, but on a less consistent basis. I also started a FB group for it, and I would have no problem with people talking about their adventures and speculating on the world and stuff. A lot of my inspiration Comes from Ars Lundi\u2019s Western Marches, which had a large amount of interaction between their players. [\u2026]\n@Mike: I don\u2019t know of a setting like you are looking for (but I suspect they *do* exist), but insofar as using The Wilderlands/City-State of the Invincible Overlord, the idea is to make it your own and put your own spin on the items on the maps.\nBasically, read them over and start making notes on ideas that come to you. Tie them together with your own machinations and reasons and plots and flesh them out as needed (potentially using resources like the Ready Ref Sheets, Castle Book, that Judges Guild also sold, but there are many other such things or you can do it all yourself). Add a few locales and encounters of your own to sew things up, and remember to put three or four different clues for each major detail, because players will often overlook one or two and might need more reminders to make a connection, especially if it\u2019s over several play sessions.\nBefore you know it, with a few good ideas you have taken their framework of disjointed encounters and shaped it into a setting that has your own personal flair and mark on it, ready to run.\n\u201cBut there was history and interconnected details. Tidbits found in one place could shed light elsewhere. Instead of just being interesting detail, these clues lead to concrete discoveries if you paid attention. If you deciphered the runes in the depths of the dwarven mines, you could learn that the exiles established another hidden fortress in the valleys to the north.\u201d\nThis is what I want to have. Most of the sandbox products I\u2019m aware of (ex: City-State or the Invincible Overlord) the locations are very independent of each other. Are they any published products that have this level of interconnections?\nThanks.\n[\u2026] is to roleplay it like you would anything else; an idea championed by Ben Robbins in his famous Westmarch Campaign. I mean, do you lay the maps of your dungeons out and say to your players, \u2018where do you want [\u2026]\n[\u2026] http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/79/grand-experiments-west-marches-part-2-sharing-info/ [\u2026]\nThis looks really cool. I might want to try something like this with gurps.\n[\u2026] I decided to use the treasure map approach Ben talked about in his blog and even directly stole the table map idea directly from the West Marches, with hopes to emulate the various PCs adding to it as time [\u2026]\n@ jeff faller\nDid you have a 5 mi / hex (old JG scale) map and utilize a lot of \u201crandom\u201d encounters w/in the hex to determine exactly \u201cwhere\u201d the characters were on the map?\nNo hexes, no squares \u2014 just an open terrain map where I drew vectors to keep track of where the party was.\nWhen you use hexes you create the illusion that once the explorers see that a hex contains \u201cforest\u201d you have explored the whole hex. Convenient in games that want to speed up exploration, but the opposite of what you want in a West Marches game.\nOR did the players give you more \u201cdirection\u201d than that? Something akin to: We head to this point on the map and walk north west for two hours\u2026or until we hit a definitive terrain feature and then we turn due west for three hours\u2026 So on and so forth. Which would seem to necessitate a fairly granular DM\u2019s map.\nThey never knew exactly where they were unless they hit a landmark, but they got very good at figuring their general location based on the marching decisions they made. The map was constantly being refined and corrected as each group passed through areas again.\nIf they said \u201cwe head to this point on the map\u201d I would say \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean anything to me, here\u2019s what you see right now, describe where you are going\u201d and they would say \u201cmarch southwest into the woods for three miles, looking for a big tree\u201d and then we\u2019d check Wilderness Lore to see if they went anywhere close to where they intended. If I described a ridge they saw and they would point at their map and say \u201chey, we must be here\u201d I would shrug and neither confirm nor deny.\nI answered questions about what they could see but not meta information about where they were (unless it was exceedingly obvious).\nHey Ben,\nQuick question, when your players were adventuring, at what scale did you run your (DM\u2019s) map? In other words, how detailed did you get? Did you have a 5 mi / hex (old JG scale) map and utilize a lot of \u201crandom\u201d encounters w/in the hex to determine exactly \u201cwhere\u201d the characters were on the map? I\u2019m imagining (possibly incorrectly here) that you ran at a pretty fine scale\u2026so that players were able to make sense of their own map.\nExample: \u201cAfter coming off a gentle ridge in the Welkin Woods you stumble across the remains of an ancient, crumbling well\u2026\u201d\nIf the hex is larger (5 mi) then how do you determine if they actually have stumbled across a specific feature?\nOh and also, if you\u2019ve got the energy or the time would it be possible to get a small excerpt of how you managed the \u201cadventuring\u201d through the wilderness portions? Was it as simple as:\nPlayers: We head due west, into the Welkin Woods\u2026\nDM: (rolls some dice for random determination) You walk over the gently undulating terrain, under the canopy of the ancient pines of the Welkin Woods for roughly two days and stumble across an obviously very old stone bridge\u2026in the middle of nowhere.\nAll this could be pulled off w/ that 5 mi. hex I would think.\nOR did the players give you more \u201cdirection\u201d than that? Something akin to: We head to this point on the map and walk north west for two hours\u2026or until we hit a definitive terrain feature and then we turn due west for three hours\u2026 So on and so forth. Which would seem to necessitate a fairly granular DM\u2019s map.\nHope I\u2019m making at least a little sense here.\nThis is some of the coolest gaming stuff I\u2019ve ever seen Ben. I just wish that I had the time and players to run such a thing. I\u2019m planning on running a bastardized version though\u2026So any information I can get on the \u201chow\u201d is always illuminating.\nKudos\n[\u2026] I\u2019m stealing the West Marches concept of the build-as-you-play Table Map. [\u2026]\n\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve got a scan of the map!\u201d\nYou mean the Frankenstein player table-map? Of course!\nBut like I said in another comment, the surface details of the game is not what makes it interesting. I could go on all day about the topography of the Goblin\u2019s Teeth / Cradle Wood / Battle Moors zone, but it wouldn\u2019t sound any different than anyone else\u2019s game.\nThe procedure was the thing: the process in-play and the dynamic between the players and GM.\nPlease tell me you\u2019ve got a scan of the map!\nSo far this is a really cool concept! One way my campaign shares information is we formed a facebook group, and people posted threads about additional actions or details during their anonymous hiking day with one random encounter. Writing little short stories (if you have the kind of group that digs that) has really made the campaign richer. There could also maybe be a local Bard NPC at the tavern that always wants to hear stories and retell them for the patrons of the bar. You could allow the different players to write those Bardic narratives, sharing info that way.\nGreat posts. This sounds like something I want to try \u2013 keep \u2019em coming!"

      "text": "Grand Experiments: West Marches\nWest Marches was a game I ran for a little over two years. It was designed to be pretty much the diametric opposite of the normal weekly game:\n- There was no regular time: every session was scheduled by the players on the fly.\n- There was no regular party: each game had different players drawn from a pool of around 10-14 people.\n- There was no regular plot: The players decided where to go and what to do. It was a sandbox game in the sense that\u2019s now used to describe video games like Grand Theft Auto, minus the missions. There was no mysterious old man sending them on quests. No overarching plot, just an overarching environment.\nMy motivation in setting things up this way was to overcome player apathy and mindless \u201cplot following\u201d by putting the players in charge of both scheduling and what they did in-game.\nA secondary goal was to make the schedule adapt to the complex lives of adults. Ad hoc scheduling and a flexible roster meant (ideally) people got to play when they could but didn\u2019t hold up the game for everyone else if they couldn\u2019t. If you can play once a week, that\u2019s fine. If you can only play once a month, that\u2019s fine too.\nLetting the players decide where to go was also intended to nip DM procrastination (aka my procrastination) in the bud. Normally a DM just puts off running a game until he\u2019s 100% ready (which is sometimes never), but with this arrangement if some players wanted to raid the Sunken Fort this weekend I had to hurry up and finish it. It was gaming on-demand, so the players created deadlines for me.\nSetting: Go West Young Man\nThe game was set in a frontier region on the edge of civilization (the eponymous West Marches). There\u2019s a convenient fortified town that marked the farthest outpost of civilization and law, but beyond that is sketchy wilderness. All the PCs are would-be adventurers based in this town. Adventuring is not a common or safe profession, so the player characters are the only ones interested in risking their lives in the wilderness in hopes of making a fortune (NPCs adventurers are few and far between). Between sorties into the wilds PCs rest up, trade info and plan their next foray in the cheery taproom of the Axe & Thistle.\nThe whole territory is (by necessity) very detailed. The landscape is broken up into a variety of regions (Frog Marshes, Cradle Wood, Pike Hollow, etc.) each with its own particular tone, ecology and hazards. There are dungeons, ruins, and caves all over the place, some big and many small. Some are known landmarks (everbody knows where the Sunken Fort is), some are rumored but their exact location is unknown (the Hall of Kings is said to be somewhere in Cradle Wood) and others are completely unknown and only discovered by exploring (search the spider-infested woods and you find the Spider Mound nest).\nPCs get to explore anywhere they want, the only rule being that going back east is off-limits \u2014 there are no adventures in the civilized lands, just peaceful retirement.\nThe environment is dangerous. Very dangerous. That\u2019s intentional, because as the great MUD Nexus teaches us, danger unites. PCs have to work together or they are going to get creamed. They also have to think and pick their battles \u2014 since they can go anywhere, there is nothing stopping them from strolling into areas that will wipe them out. If they just strap on their swords and charge everything they see they are going to be rolling up new characters. Players learn to observe their environment and adapt \u2014 when they find owlbear tracks in the woods they give the area a wide berth (at least until they gain a few levels). When they stumble into the lair of a terrifying hydra they retreat and round up a huge posse to hunt it down.\nThe PCs are weak but central: they are small fish in a dangerous world that they have to explore with caution, but because they are the only adventurers they never play second fiddle. Overshadowed by looming peaks and foreboding forests yes. Overshadowed by other characters, no.\nScheduling: Players Are In Control\nThe West Marches charter is that games only happen when the players decide to do something \u2014 the players initiate all adventures and it\u2019s their job to schedule games and organize an adventuring party once they decide where to go.\nPlayers send emails to the list saying when they want to play and what they want to do. A normal scheduling email would be something like \u201cI\u2019d like to play Tuesday. I want to go back and look for that ruined monastery we heard out about past the Golden Hills. I know Mike wants to play, but we could use one or two more. Who\u2019s interested?\u201d Interested players chime in and negotiation ensues. Players may suggest alternate dates, different places to explore (\u201cI\u2019ve been to the monastery and it\u2019s too dangerous. Let\u2019s track down the witch in Pike Hollow instead!\u201d), whatever \u2014 it\u2019s a chaotic process, and the details sort themselves out accordingly. In theory this mirrors what\u2019s going on in the tavern in the game world: adventurers are talking about their plans, finding comrades to join them, sharing info, etc.\nThe only hard scheduling rules are:\n- The GM has to be available that day (obviously) so this system only works if the GM is pretty flexible.\n- The players have to tell the GM where they plan on going well in advance, so he (meaning me) has at least a chance to prepare anything that\u2019s missing. As the campaign goes on this becomes less and less of a problem, because so many areas are so fleshed out the PCs can go just about anywhere on the map and hit adventure. The GM can also veto a plan that sounds completely boring and not worth a game session.\nAll other decisions are up to the players \u2014 they fight it out among themselves, sometimes literally.\nContinued:\nWest Marches (part 2), Sharing Info\nWest Marches (part 3), Recycling\nWest Marches (part 4), Death & Danger\nWest Marches: Running Your Own\nNew:\nWest Marches: Secrets & Answers\nWest Marches: Layers of History\nWest Marches: A Survivor\u2019s Story\nLeave a reply\nWow, Thanks for the speedy answer Ben!\nI believe that makes sense. Just calculate the time it takes to reach a destination, and explain what the players see there. Pretty easy!\nStill, I hope you archive those maps online someday. The fact that they inspired a genre of TTRPGs makes them priceless.\nHave Fun Storming the Castle,\nThe Bread Pirate\nHey Ben!\nYour adventures in the West Marches have inspired me to try my own West March campaign.\nRight now I\u2019m working on an overworld map, and I need to decide between using Hexes, Grid Paper, or a Point Crawl? Yet I heard you did none of those.\nIn Part II of your West Marches Blog you left a comment saying, \u201c(I used) no hexes, no squares \u2014 just an open terrain map where I drew vectors to keep track of where the party was.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m curious what that actually would look like on a map. Have you ever published your maps from the campaign for people to look at?\nHave Fun Storming the Castle,\n-Bread\nVery cool! No, I never published the maps, and it probably wouldn\u2019t really help. It would just look like any other wilderness map.\nBut the method I used is actually pretty simple. To see what I mean, just take a real wilderness map, draw a little X for the starting point, and then every few hours of travel draw a line showing the distance and direction the party traveled and tell the players what they see. Of course that\u2019s on your map, which the players can\u2019t see \u2014 the players are probably making their own map, and might be doing the same thing, but that\u2019s up to them.\nNormally they go exactly the direction they expect, but if it\u2019s tangled wood etc they might get turned around (insert character skills here), which can cause them a huge headache as they try to find known landmarks and reestablish their bearings \u2014 just like real life.\nThe interesting part is that except for maybe rolling to get lost in a forest, there are no game mechanics involved. It\u2019s just the players listening to what you describe, saying which way they go, and you calculating how far they could walk in that terrain, and then telling them how far they got and what they see now. It is pure interaction. They\u2019re using their brains, which reinforces the whole concept that their decisions drive the action.\nBold veterans could even skip mapping entirely. Just listen to what you say and rely on their actual memory of the land to try to navigate around. It\u2019s up to them.\n[\u2026] to succeed. R2G runs TTRPG nights. It struck me that a game store could be a great place to run a West Marches campaign, a sandbox-style game that (in its ideal form) organically supports an ever-shifting cast, [\u2026]\n[\u2026] could do. It will most definitely be a west marches style campaign [best overall explanation; original person] with starting level characters. The group I\u2019m a part of some times has people miss for [\u2026]\n[\u2026] of the neat/cool things about Ben Robbin\u2019s West Marches game was that players would share info w/each [\u2026]\n[\u2026] detailed in the article \u201cGrand Experiments: West Marches\u201d the cliff notes description of this style of campaign is that the \u201cWest Marches\u201d is a [\u2026]\n[\u2026] may know this style as a sand box game or a West Marches game but back in the old days we called it an open world or open environment game. This is style of [\u2026]\n[\u2026] Table Gaming. Open Table Gaming is similar to West Marches play (learn about West Marches campaigns here and here). Open Table gaming is sightly different, and includes these key [\u2026]\n[\u2026] West Marches Campaign style was created by Ben Robbins (I highly recommend checking him out).

Session starts, Bob is there too, now Carol, who had thumbs-up\u2019d The Hills proposal starts the session by saying they\u2019re all going to The Opposite Direction. After two hours of irl discussion, a decision is reached. (Or, alternatively, one PC crosses some kind of Rubicon that makes the rest of the group decide if they should throw the whole session out or just go along.)\nDefinitely, of course. But the rule is, if the players say they\u2019re going to do something ahead of time, the agreement is they should stick to that plan at the table, at least to start. Planning one thing and then showing up to do something completely different is unfair to the GM and can lead to very boring games.\nOf course there are times when that rule can totally be broken (and it was, several times in our game). But the point of agreeing in advance is to avoid wasting table time. If players are making flight plans and then ignoring them, you need to call foul and tell them so.\n[\u2026] Swords & Wizardry-Kampagne namens Zal\u00fa.
