      "summary": "Rob Kaplan stresses the importance of Fed independence amid the upcoming leadership transition, arguing that Fed officials must make decisions free of political pressure. He forecasts a possible rate cut in September but cautions that it will not signal the start of a broader easing cycle, citing sticky service‑sector inflation and sluggish growth. Kaplan also notes that tariffs are likely to have a temporary impact, while structural drivers such as a data‑center power boom could help moderate inflation over time.",
