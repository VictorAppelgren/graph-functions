  "title": "Best Whitening Toothpaste of 2025, According to Dentists",
  "description": "Here are the dentist-recommended best whitening toothpaste for a brighter, more twinkly smile.",
  "content": "If in-office whitening treatments aren't in your budget, teeth whitening kits or toothpastes can help you get a whiter smile from the comfort of your home. However, you'll want to be realistic about these results, according to dentist Dr. Sandip Sachar: \"It should be noted that while whitening toothpastes can help remove surface stains and maintain brightness, they have limitations -- most won\u2019t change the natural color of your teeth or treat deep discoloration.\" Many dentists also don't advise that you use a whitening toothpaste every day. To help you find the best whitening toothpastes for short-term use, we reached out to dentists to find out what they recommend to their patients.\n\nWhat is the best whitening toothpaste overall?\n\nWe did not choose a single best whitening toothpaste because the ideal option depends on individual preferences and needs. Below, we have listed various types of whitening toothpaste based on dentist recommendations. However, if you have any questions, it's best to consult your dental provider for personalized advice.\n\u2022 Contains 5% hydrogen peroxide, which whitens intrinsically and extrinsically\n\u2022 Formula may be too strong or cause irritation for some Why we like it: Colgate Optic White Pro Series toothpaste is one whitening toothpaste that Dr. Fatima Khan, a dentist in Houston, Texas, recommends. Some of her reasons for recommending it include its trusted brand name and its 5% hydrogen peroxide whitening agent. Unlike other whitening agents that work by removing stains on the surface of the tooth, hydrogen peroxide can get inside the tooth so it whitens intrinsically as well as extrinsically. Sachar also recommends this toothpaste, saying, \"Colgate Optic White Pro Series is the strongest professional-level whitening toothpaste on the market and would be my pick. Its 5% hydrogen peroxide content is the most effective bleaching agent in an OTC toothpaste, delivering visible results fast.\" However, she recommends patients use it with care and alternate it with a non-whitening or enamel-repairing toothpaste periodically. Who is it best for: Optic White Pro Series is best for anyone who is looking for a whitening toothpaste that contains both hydrogen peroxide and fluoride. Who should not get it: According to Khan, one downside to this toothpaste is that it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which may cause irritation, such as canker sores. Other popular whitening toothpastes may also contain SLS, so it's important to look at the ingredients before you buy a product if you're sensitive to it. \"It may not be ideal for sensitive teeth or continuous long-term use without alternating with a non-whitening toothpaste,\" adds Sachar. \"I recommend this one for short-term use or occasional whitening boosts. I tell my patients to use it for short periods of time and alternate it with a non-whitening or enamel-repairing toothpaste periodically.\" $8 at Amazon $8 at Walmart $8 at Target\n\nIs whitening toothpaste better for your teeth than whitening strips? Not necessarily. Dr. Erin Fraundorf, founder of BOCA Orthodontic and Whitening Studio, said that while teeth whitening with a toothpaste can be \"effective in the short term,\" overuse can lead to sensitivity and damage over time. Instead of whitening toothpaste, Fraundorf recommends seeing your dentist for in-office whitening, or choosing another home product such as whitening strips from Opalescence. \"Toothpaste will not give you the instant whitening results as whitening strips or in-office whitening because those contain a higher concentration of the hydrogen peroxide, and duration of the agent being on your teeth is longer compared to toothpaste,\" Khan also said. Can I prevent my teeth from getting yellow? It's important to keep in mind a little discoloration is normal and inevitable -- teeth may be white-ish in color, but that doesn't mean they have to be white white. It's also important to note that having white teeth doesn't necessarily mean your oral health is in tip-top shape. That being said, there are some things you can do to minimize your teeth taking on a tint: Stay on top of regular, professional cleanings. That's preferably twice a year, but at least once a year, and maybe more often, as they may effectively and safely remove some surface stains. Also, make sure your regular oral care routine is solid, complete with regular flossing and an electric toothbrush. Swish with water after drinking coffee or wine. Fraundorf recommends taking a swish of flat water (not sparkling) between sips of coffee or wine, which are two major culprits of staining teeth. Drinking water often, and moving it around your mouth, will also help with the acidity of certain foods and beverages. Chew sugar-free gum. Another suggestion from Fraundrof, as chewing sugar-free gum after meals has been shown to help reduce the likelihood of cavities. Which is the strongest whitening toothpaste? \"While Colgate Optic White Pro Series offers the strongest whitening with 5% peroxide (the highest concentration legally available in over-the-counter toothpaste), it may not be ideal for sensitive teeth or continuous long-term use without alternating with a non-whitening toothpaste,\" explains Sachar. \"I recommend this one for short-term use or occasional whitening boosts. I tell my patients to use it for short periods of time and alternate it with a non-whitening or enamel-repairing toothpaste periodically.\"",

      "text": "Tooth Whiteners & Oral Hygiene Products containing hydrogen peroxide\nContext - To date, millions of tooth whitening kits have been sold across the world to consumers seeking to brighten their smiles. Tooth whitening products can be applied as paint-on gels, strips, or mouth guards, either at the dentist\u2019s office or at home. The whitening ingredient in these products is hydrogen peroxide. In general, the more hydrogen peroxide, the greater the whitening power.\nToothpastes and mouth rinses may also contain low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as a disinfectant to prevent plaque and inflammation of the gums.\nAre toothpastes, mouth-rinses and tooth whitening products containing hydrogen peroxide safe? Should they be freely available to consumers?\nAn assessment by the European Commission Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP)\n- Hydrogen Peroxide\n- What is hydrogen peroxide and what is it used for?\n- What health effects of hydrogen peroxide have been observed?\n- Oral hygiene products & tooth whiteners\n- How is hydrogen peroxide used to whiten teeth?\n- How much hydrogen peroxide is an individual exposed to when using dental products?\n- Can tooth whitening products containing hydrogen peroxide harm teeth?\n- How safe are products containing hydrogen peroxide?\n- What should be considered before a tooth whitening treatment?\n- Conclusion \u2013 Are oral hygiene products and tooth whiteners containing hydrogen peroxide safe and should they be freely available to consumers?\nThe answers to these questions are a faithful summary of the scientific opinion\nproduced in 2007 by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP):\n\"Opinion on Hydrogen peroxide, in its free form or when released, in oral hygiene products and tooth whitening products\" Learn more...\n1. What is hydrogen peroxide and what is it used for?\nHydrogen peroxide is used in some toothpastes, mouth rinses and tooth whitening products\nSource: Sergei Krassii\nHydrogen peroxide is a highly reactive chemical containing hydrogen and oxygen. It is used mainly in the production of other chemicals and to bleach paper and textiles. Moreover, contact lenses can be disinfected with highly diluted hydrogen peroxide.\nCarbamide peroxide is a chemical that is made of hydrogen peroxide and urea.\nBoth hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide are used in cosmetics, mainly as bleaches in dental products such as tooth whiteners and some hair products. Low concentrations may also be used in toothpastes and mouth rinses as a disinfectant to prevent plaque and inflammation of the gums. More...\nIn the European Union, cosmetics are regulated by the Cosmetics Directive\n2. What health effects of hydrogen peroxide have been observed?\nThe use of contact lens solutions containing some hydrogen peroxide can irritate the eyes\nSource: Free Software Foundation\n2.1 Swallowing a large dose of hydrogen peroxide can be lethal to humans. More...\n2.2 Highly diluted hydrogen peroxide solutions are non-irritant or mildly irritant. However, animal tests have shown that, when exceeding certain concentrations, hydrogen peroxide can cause irritation of eyes, skin, and the inside of mouth, stomach, and intestine. The use of eye drops and contact lens solutions containing some hydrogen peroxide can irritate the eyes. Hydrogen peroxide is not considered to cause allergic reactions of the skin. More...\n2.3 To test whether repeated exposure to hydrogen peroxide can harm health, mice and rats were given hydrogen peroxide solutions by various means. Above certain exposure levels, effects on body weight, blood and some organs were seen. Risks to humans can be assessed by comparing human exposures to the highest exposure at which no harmful effects were observed in any animal studies. More...\n2.4 Hydrogen peroxide can act as a weak cancer promoter, meaning it can slightly stimulate the growth or multiplication of cancer cells. There is not enough data to evaluate potential effects of hydrogen peroxide on reproduction and development. More...\n2.5 People with certain genetic disorders are more vulnerable to hydrogen peroxide because their bodies cannot break it down effectively. More...\n3. How is hydrogen peroxide used to whiten teeth?\nTooth whiteners can be applied to teeth using custom made mouthguards\nSource: GreenFacts\nTooth whiteners and oral hygiene products \u2013 such as certain toothpastes and mouth rinses \u2013 use hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide for its whitening and/or disinfecting properties. Peroxide whitens teeth by passing into the tooth and reacting with the molecules that cause stains or discoloration. In general, the more peroxide, the greater the whitening power.\nDepending on their peroxide content, such products are either freely sold over the counter for home use, dispensed by dentists for home use, or exclusively applied by dentists in their offices. In the European Union, oral hygiene products may only be sold freely to consumers if they contain no more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide whereas in the USA, whitening products are sold at higher concentrations. In-office bleaching generally uses products with higher levels of whitening agents.\nTooth whitening products can be applied at home in three different ways: using strips that are stuck onto teeth, custom made mouthguards that maintain the whitening product on the teeth, or gels that are painted directly on the teeth.\nThe length of treatment depends on the level of discoloration and the whitening product used. It ranges from short interventions in the dental office to applications at home lasting minutes/hours per day and repeated over a number of days. More...\n4. How much hydrogen peroxide is an individual exposed to when using dental products?\n4.1 Toothpastes and mouth rinses may also contain low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as a disinfectant to prevent plaque and inflammation of the gums. Studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide from toothpastes or mouth rinses is rapidly broken down in the mouth by the saliva, but some of it is swallowed. Toothpastes and mouth rinses that contain small amounts of hydrogen peroxide and are used once or twice per day do not seem to harm the inside of the mouth ,when used up to 6 months for toothpastes or 24 months for mouth rinses. However, rinses that contain larger amounts of hydrogen peroxide or that are used more frequently can cause mouth irritation. More...\n4.2 How much hydrogen peroxide is released into the saliva during tooth whitening treatments depends mostly on the amount of hydrogen peroxide in the product being used and the product type and only partly on the amount of saliva produced.\nDuring a tooth whitening treatment procedure, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the gums and in the saliva falls rapidly because hydrogen peroxide is broken down quickly.\nIt is estimated that up to 25% of the hydrogen peroxide applied by tooth whitening products is swallowed. More...\n5. Can tooth whitening products containing hydrogen peroxide harm teeth?\n5.1 The two most common side effects of using tooth whitening products containing hydrogen peroxide are mouth irritation and increased tooth sensitivity to temperature changes. Both effects are temporary. No information is available on long-term effects of the use of tooth whitening products or on the effects of repeated use of such products. More...\nAccording to most studies, tooth whitening does not harm the enamel\n5.2 Hydrogen peroxide passes easily through the tooth enamel. According to most existing studies, bleaching does not harm the enamel. However, a few investigations have reported that bleaching can harm the surface of the teeth, making the enamel more porous and leading to dents, scratches, and loss of minerals. More...\n5.3 After crossing the enamel, hydrogen peroxide passes into dentin and pulp. In some cases, whiteners cause minor inflammations of the pulp, which might be the reason for the increased tooth sensitivity that sometimes occurs. However, generally, tooth whitening does not seem to harm dental pulp of healthy teeth, possibly because the levels of hydrogen peroxide are too low to cause damage. More...\n5.4 Tooth whitening does not usually change the colour of fillings and other restorative materials. It does not affect porcelain, other ceramics, or dental gold. However, it can slightly affect restorations made with composite materials, cements and dental amalgams. More...\n6. How safe are products containing hydrogen peroxide?\n6.1 Solutions containing more than 5% hydrogen peroxide are labelled \u201charmful\u201d and \u201cirritating to eyes\u201d. At higher concentrations other mentions are added, highlighting the risk of serious damage to eyes, irritation of the respiratory system and skin, and burns. More...\n6.2 Oral hygiene products and tooth whiteners containing hydrogen peroxide are not very likely to affect the body as a whole, because the substance is rapidly broken down. But above certain levels effects have been seen in animals. In addition, there are concerns about direct effects like irritation in the mouth and in the gastrointestinal system after swallowing.\nIn the European Union, oral hygiene products may only be sold freely to consumers if they contain no more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide.\nRisks to humans can be estimated based on animal studies. For general effects on the body, the margin of safety is considered sufficient if human exposures are at least 100 times lower than the level at which no effects have been observed in any animal study. This is the case for toothpastes and mouth rinses containing 0.1% of hydrogen peroxide and tooth whitening products containing 6% of hydrogen peroxide, but not for tooth whitening products containing more hydrogen peroxide. More...\n7. What should be considered before a tooth whitening treatment?\nBefore engaging in tooth whitening treatment, a dentist should be consulted\nSource: StockXpert\nAbove 0.1% hydrogen peroxide, tooth bleaching is not just a simple cosmetic procedure. Dentists should diagnose the cause of the staining, check whether patients have any other oral health problems, and counsel patients about the best way of dealing with this esthetical problem.\nAs already mentioned above, common undesirable side effects of tooth whitening treatment, such as increased tooth sensitivity and mouth irritation, usually disappear within a few days. The surface of fillings and other restorations can be affected.\nHydrogen peroxide can act as a weak cancer promoter, meaning it can slightly stimulate the growth or multiplication of cancer cells. Tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and specific genetic predispositions increase the risk of oral cancer. Hydrogen peroxide may therefore further increase this risk, especially when the treatment is repeated. This may be of concern as smokers are likely candidates for tooth whitening. The risk of harmful effects may be greater for people who have pre-existing oral diseases. More...\n8. Conclusion \u2013 Are oral hygiene products and tooth whiteners containing hydrogen peroxide safe and should they be freely available to consumers?\nTo conclude, the SCCP (Scientific Committee on Consumer Products) of the European Commission expressed the following opinions:\n- The use of toothpastes, mouth rinses and tooth whiteners containing up to 0.1% hydrogen peroxide does not pose a risk to the health of the consumer. Toothpastes and mouth rinses should not contain more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide.\n- The use tooth whitening products containing 0.1 to 6 % hydrogen peroxide entails potential risks for the consumer. These risks increase with increasing concentration of hydrogen peroxide and frequency of application.\nPotential risks of the use of tooth whiteners containing between 0.1 and 6 % hydrogen peroxide can be limited if tooth whitening is done properly with the approval and under the supervision of a dentist. The specific situation of each individual should be taken into account prior to treatment.\nAdditional research is needed on the use of tooth whitening products over longer time periods. - Use of tooth whitening products containing more than 6% is not considered safe for use by consumers.\nThe Three-Level Structure used to communicate this SCCP Opinion is copyrighted by GreenFacts asbl/vzw"

The vulnerability of motor neurons in response to chronic peripheral nerve hyperstimulation was tested in the SOD1(G93A) rat model of ALS. A novel in vivo technique for peripheral phrenic nerve stimulation was developed via intra-diaphragm muscle electrode implantation at the phrenic motor endpoint. Chronic bilateral phrenic nerve hyperstimulation in SOD1(G93A) rats accelerated disease progression, including shortened lifespan, hastened motor neuron loss and increased denervation at diaphragm neuromuscular junctions. Hyperstimulation also resulted in focal decline in adjacent forelimb function. These results show that peripheral phrenic nerve hyperstimulation accelerates cell death of vulnerable spinal motor neurons, modifies both temporal and anatomical onset of disease, and leads to involvement of disease in adjacent anatomical regions in this ALS model.\n-\nInhibition of ergosterol synthesis using inhibitory drugs or ERG gene deletions alters brome mosaic virus RNA replication complex formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n2008 Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology Meeting\nMore activity by Chris\n-\nThe healthcare industry is evolving, and we're ready to lead the way toward a more patient-centric future.

      "text": "Let's face it -- nobody enjoys dentist appointments, especially when you see the bill afterward. Getting your teeth professionally whitened can cost a small fortune, but thankfully, you don't need to sit in that dentist chair to achieve a brighter smile. Home whitening kits can also get you impressive results, and we've tested everything from easy-to-use strips to daily mouthwashes to find what actually works.\nRead more: Best Gifts Available on Amazon: From $10 to $250\nMost effective options use powerful whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide to remove stains, though gentler alternatives exist for those with sensitive teeth. We've combed through countless products to identify the best teeth-whitening kits that can help you get that brighter smile without leaving your home.\nWhat is the best teeth whitening kit overall?\nTeeth whitening strips have been around for a long time, but there are some kits out now that do it a little bit better. From sensitive teeth to longterm whitening, the best teeth whitening kit overall for you will largely depend on your oral health and your needs.\nBest teeth whitening kits for 2025\nPros\n- Offers a custom fit\n- Good customer service\nCons\n- Making your own impressions at home can be tricky\n- Need to be careful not to use too much gel\nTeeth whitening kits aren't exactly what most people would call riveting. I must say I was blown away by the entire Smile Brilliant process and package. I wasn't aware you could get custom-fitted whitening trays anywhere other than a dentist's office, but you can with Smile Brilliant.\nWearing these whitening trays is just like wearing a retainer. They fit perfectly to your teeth because they're designed using putty impressions you make of your teeth. The process works like this: You order a kit, Smile Brilliant sends you a putty impression kit, you return the impressions via prepaid packaging and then Smile Brilliant sends your custom-fitted whitening trays within a matter of days.\nIf you mess up during the impression process (which I did; my impressions were evidently a bit shallow), Smile Brilliant will either send you a new impression kit or go ahead with the trays if they think they can make it work. In the latter case, the company will still send an impression kit along with your whitening trays just in case.\nTo use the trays, simply squeeze the carbamide peroxide whitening gel into your upper and lower trays and slip them on. Be careful not to squeeze too much gel, or it may spill over the tops of your trays and get on your gums and tongue. I did this the first time I wore my Smile Brilliant trays and the gel felt pretty tingly. Other than that, I had no problems with these trays, despite my shallow impressions.\nPros\n- Caters to people with sensitive teeth\n- Easy to incorporate into your routine\n- Alternative to hydrogen peroxide\nCons\n- Results may not be as noticeable as other treatments\nThe whitening kit from Lumineux is not a typical teeth-whitening kit. Instead of hydrogen peroxide gel and an LED mouthpiece, this whitening kit simply includes daily essentials for teeth whitening, which is why it's the best for sensitive teeth -- most people with sensitive teeth can't handle something like hydrogen peroxide and LED lights.\nThis whitening kit includes Lumineux whitening strips, whitening toothpaste and mouthwash, all of which use Lumineux's patented formula containing coconut oil, dead sea salt and citrus oil. For extra white teeth, don't just use these products separately like you normally might. The instructions are explicit: Wear the strips for 30 minutes, brush immediately after for at least one minute and then rinse with the mouthwash for at least one minute.\nI love this kit because I have sensitive teeth and struggle to get through whitening treatments that involve bleach or hydrogen peroxide.\nPros\n- Comfortable mouthpiece\n- Inexpensive\nCons\n- Not for people with sensitive teeth\nThis teeth-whitening kit is decent all around, but a few things prevented it from topping the list: The mouthpiece felt massive (although I have a small mouth) and the gel didn't seem to spread evenly over my teeth. I also got quite a few white chemical burns from the gel in this product. If you're looking for a whitening kit that costs less than $30, it couldn't hurt to try this one, as long as you don't have sensitive gums or teeth.\nThe whitening gel is easy to dispense from the syringes, which was a welcome feature after spending too much time and effort squeezing tiny tubes of whitening gel with other products. The mouthpiece, although too big for me, feels rather nice on the teeth. It's very squishy compared to the harder plastic in some other products.\nFinally, the case that comes with it is nice to have. It makes it easy to travel with your whitening kit if you want to.\nBest teeth whitening kits compared\n| Superlative | Type | Recommended frequency of use | Recommended duration of use | Ingredients | Price | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Smile Brilliant Custom Teeth Whitening Trays | Best custom fitted whitening kit | Trays and gel | When teeth are sensitive, 1-2 hours every other day is recommended. When little to no sensitivity is experienced, as long as 3 hours once daily is recommended. | A person with average stained teeth and no natural sensitivity will see results in 7-14 applications. For those with sensitivity (who require shorter whitening sessions), it may take more than 14 applications. | Glycerin, Carbamide Peroxide, Carbomer, Menthol, EDTA | $149 |\n| Lumineux Whitening Kit | Best whitening kit for sensitive teeth | Whitening strips, whitening toothpaste and mouthwash | For whitening strips: Apply the whitening strips for 30 minutes, then brush with Lumineux whitening toothpaste and rinse with Lumineux whitening mouthwash. Use as often as you\u2019d like. For mouthwash: Rinse vigorously with 1 capful of mouthwash for 60-120 seconds twice a day. For toothpaste: Apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste and gently brush in circular motions for two minutes. | Use strips 7 days in a row, then 1-2 times a week thereafter to maintain your white smile. | Whitening Strips: Vegetable Glycerol, Deionized Water, Carbomer, Carboxymethyl, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Dead Sea Salt (Maris Sal), Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil. Whitening Formula Mouthwash: Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Xylitol*, Purified Water (Aqua), Dead Sea Salt (Maris Sal), Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Organic Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Oil, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Oil. Whitening Formula Toothpaste: Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Vegetable Glycerin, Xylitol*, Hydrated Silica, Purified Water (Aqua), Dead Sea Salt (Maris Sal), Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Xanthan Gum*, Titanium Dioxide, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Oil, Carrageenan\u2020, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Organic Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Oil, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Oil | $25 |\n| Auraglow Deluxe Home Teeth Whitening Kit | Best gel and LED whitening kit | Gel and LED | Use for 30 minutes per day for best results. | Whitens up to 10 shades in 7 days. | Glycerin, Urea Peroxide, Propylene Glycol, Xylitol, Carbomer, Mentha Piperita Oil, Triethanolamine, Aqua, (35% carbamide peroxide) | $28 |\nAnother teeth whitening kit we tested\nThe product below wasn't a favorite, but it has some qualities worth mentioning. It may be a whitening kit for you.\n- Shyn Brighter LED Whitening System (out of stock): Previously, Shyn had an LED whitening kit that used Rembrandt whitening strips, which I loved. It was on my original list of the best overall teeth-whitening products. I liked the old kit because whitening strips are much less messy than whitening gel and, to my knowledge, that was the only whitening kit out there that used strips instead of gel. That product was discontinued, but Shyn now has a whitening kit that uses a carbamide peroxide whitening gel. The Shyn Brighter LED whitening kit is similar to other whitening kits on the market, especially the Colgate SuperNova. It comes with a silicone tray, an LED light device, and whitening pens to fill the mouth tray with gel. This kit comes with three whitening pens, which is a nice touch because you won't have to order refills as soon as you would with other kits. When the time comes, you can buy a single maximum-strength refill teeth whitening pen or a pack of three. You can use the pens without the LED tray, too, if you don't want to walk around with a mouthpiece in. The Shyn Brighter kit also comes with a travel case. The case makes for neat storage at home in addition to traveling.\nHow to choose the best teeth whitening kit\nThere are many teeth whitening kits on the market, so it might be difficult to choose the best one for you. I tested several kits to bring you this list of the best teeth whitening kit options for 2025. I couldn't accurately judge these products on whitening power (I wish I could, but my teeth won't allow it), but I did judge them against criteria like mouthpiece fit, type of whitening gel, kit contents, treatment length and refill options.\nHere's what to consider before buying your next whitening kit.\n- Key ingredients: The most effective whitening products will contain peroxide. The most common are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Some products may contain only hydrogen peroxide and others contain carbamide peroxide, but they have similar effects. Studies have shown that both peroxides have the same whitening effect on teeth.\n- Whitening levels: If you are looking for a whitening kit to reverse years of stains, you will need one with high levels of whitening power. These may be a bit more expensive and may require longer wear or treatment. You can be less picky with whitening kits for simple upkeep or the occasional use.\n- Types: There are four types of whitening kits out there: gel, LED, pens and toothpaste. Depending on the kit, you may have a few options instead of one. If you don't know which type will work best, look for a kit that contains almost four types to try.\n- Sensitivity: If you have especially sensitive teeth, it is important to look for products that cater to your needs. Whitening your teeth can be a bit uncomfortable, but if the pain is excruciating, stop using the product immediately.\n- Cost: Teeth whitening kits can cost you anywhere from $50 to $500. Professional whitening treatment can run as much as $1,800. At-home kits are the most cost-effective."

      "text": "Fluoride in drinking water has become a controversial topic in the US, especially after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's nomination to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services, wrote this on X: \"On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water. Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders and thyroid disease.\"\nThough no fluoride removal advisories have been issued from the Trump White House, RFK Jr.'s post remains along with the debate about fluoride in our water supply. To help answer the questions that many have regarding fluoride, we reached out to experts at the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Dental Association and Environmental Protection Agency for answers.\nWhat is fluoride? Why is it added to our water?\n\"Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine, which is the 13th most common element on earth,\" the American Dental Association tells CNET in an email. \"It occurs naturally in all water sources, such as springs, lakes, rivers, groundwater and seawater. The US Environmental Protection Agency labels anything that isn't hydrogen or oxygen in water as a contaminant, such as magnesium, iron, calcium, fluoride and more. The EPA sets Maximum Contaminant Levels for all of these.\"\nThe ADA also describes fluoride, a mineral, as \"nature's cavity fighter.\" Aside from water sources, it can be found in rocks, soil and plants and, as a result, has made its way into our foods and beverages. You've likely also seen fluoride as an ingredient in dental products like toothpaste since it has been shown to strengthen tooth enamel (your tooth's hard surface) and assist teeth in resisting decay (aka cavities).\nCavities are caused by a disease called \"caries,\" which is five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than hayfever in people aged 5 to 17, per the ADA. Untreated cavities can cause pain that affects overall health and results in trouble sleeping, speaking, eating and paying attention at school or work.\nSince 1945, the US has added fluoride to its water supply as a cost-effective, equitable strategy to prevent cavities and improve oral health. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named this fluoridation of drinking water one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. Now, three out of four Americans receive fluoride in their public drinking water, according to the American Cancer Society, which adds that the decision to incorporate fluoride into public water is made at the state or local level.\nOn the financial side, the CDC states that communities of at least 1,000 people see an average estimated return on investment of $20 for every $1 spent on water fluoridation. On average, a person saves $32 each year by avoiding cavity treatment. Here, the organization cites a 2016 study, adding that the ROI for community water fluoridation will increase as the community size increases.\nThe US Public Health Service currently recommends an optimal fluoride concentration in drinking water of 0.7 milligrams/liter. In a 55-gallon bucket, this is about three drops of water. However, this is not an enforceable standard. It is half of the World Health Organization's 1.5 mg/L guideline.\nAlso non-enforceable are the EPA's National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations, which recommend that drinking water contain no more than 2.0 mg/L of fluoride. \"EPA's secondary maximum contaminant level (a non-enforceable standard) is set at 2.0 mg/L, which is recommended to protect children against tooth discoloration and/or pitting,\" the EPA tells CNET in an email. What is enforceable is the EPA's Primary Drinking Water Regulation, which is 4.0 mg/L for fluoride. \"This level was set to prevent against increased risk of crippling skeletal fluorosis, a condition characterized by pain and tenderness of the major joints,\" the EPA states.\nThough community water systems are not required to comply with the secondary standard, the EPA does require that they notify customers within 12 months if fluoride levels are over 2.0 mg/L. If the fluoride level is above the primary standard, 4.0 mg/L, people must be notified within 30 days.\nWhat are fluoride recommendations and regulations?\n\"The CDC recommendations are what should be followed for community water fluoridation and health benefits,\" Dr. Susan Fisher-Owens, MD, MPH, an expert on oral health and American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson, tells CNET in an email. \"This level (0.7 mg/L, also sometimes referred to as parts per million) is the optimal level where there are the most benefits to people's teeth with minimal risks.\" She shares that other countries have similar community water fluoridation levels, like Canada (0.7 mg/L) and New Zealand (0.7-1 mg/L).\nFisher-Owens adds that the EPA's standards are based on risk, with the primary standard (4 mg/L) being higher than we want in water. \"The secondary standard (2 mg/L) is also above the ideal level, as determined by risk versus benefit, in that there is a greater likelihood of issues like spotting on teeth, without an increased benefit.\"\nIs fluoride in drinking water safe?\n\"Studies continue to show that widespread community water fluoridation prevents cavities and saves money, both for families and the health care system,\" reports the CDC, citing a 2007 study and 2015 study and concluding that fluoride in water reduces cavities by about 25% in children and adults.\nThe ADA echoes the sentiment that fluoride in drinking water is \"safe, effective and healthy.\" The association states that thousands of studies, 70 years of research and the experience of 210 million Americans have led it to conclude that water fluoridation is \"effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\" The AAP agrees.\nSince tooth decay can affect anyone throughout their lifespan, water fluoridation benefits people of all ages, per the AAP. Older adults, for instance, benefit because fluoridation prevents decay on teeth with exposed root surfaces, which affects older adults especially.\n\"As a doctor, I think it is important to remind people that teeth are important to the rest of the body because tooth problems are associated with worse and more expensive overall health, including affecting pregnancy, diabetes, stroke, kidney disease, dementia and more,\" states Fisher-Owens.\nIs there a link between fluoridation of water and cancer?\n\"Many population-based studies have looked at the potential link between water fluoride levels and cancer,\" writes the American Cancer Society. \"Most of these have not found a strong link to cancer.\" The organization explains that many of these studies have relied on factors that are difficult to control. For instance, in studies that compare different groups of people, their fluoride exposure and cancer rates, it's impossible to prove that fluoride (and not other lifestyle factors) was the sole influence on cancer rates.\nThere is also the question of how the type of fluoride, level of fluoride, amount of time exposed and age range during exposure increases one's risk. The ACS states that when it comes to fluoride, much of the cancer concern appears to be around osteosarcoma, a rare type of bone cancer that typically develops in bone growth plates. The popular theory is that since fluoride tends to collect in the bone's growth plates, the fluoride might cause the growth plate cells to grow faster and cause cancer.\nBecause only about 500 osteosarcomas are diagnosed in US children and teens each year, it can be challenging to conduct large studies that can pick up on smaller differences in cancer rates between groups. \"Smaller studies can usually detect big differences in cancer rates between two groups, but they might not be able to detect small differences,\" explains the American Cancer Society. \"If fluoride increased the risk only slightly, it might not be picked up by these types of studies.\"\nA 2025 systematic review concluded, \"No clear link between fluoride and primary bone cancers found in 12 of 14 studies\u2026No consistent links were observed across age, sex or fluoride levels.\" The review also states that most studies were of low quality, so results should be interpreted cautiously. More high-quality research is needed.\nFluoride and children's IQ and neurodevelopment\nIn an August 2024 systematic review of published scientific material on fluoride exposure from all sources (not just drinking water) and neurodevelopment and cognition, the National Toxicology Program \"concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children.\" However, this is almost double the amount of 0.7 mg/L, the optimal fluoride guideline for US community water. The review was also primarily based on studies in non-US countries.\n\"It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for US community water supplies has a negative effect on children's IQ,\" according to the review. \"The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\"\nConsidering the current research and statements published by multiple health organizations, the United States recommended fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L is considered safe. However, the NTP stated that, as of April 2020, community water systems supplying water with 1.5 mg/L or more of naturally occurring fluoride affected 0.59% of the US population (about 1.9 million people), while systems supplying water with 2 mg/L or more of naturally occurring fluoride served 0.31% of the US population (about 1 million people). Collectively, that's 2.9 million people or 0.9% of the US population.\n\"No water supply in the US fluoridates (or has ever fluoridated) at these levels,\" the ADA tells CNET, referring to the EPA's Primary and Secondly Maximum Contaminant Levels. \"The MCLs are set for areas in the country that have high naturally occurring levels of fluoride, mostly seen in the western US. This impacts only 0.31% of the country.\" The latter reiterates the NTP's finding for systems supplying water with 2 mg/L or more of naturally occurring fluoride.\nSkeletal fluorosis and fluoride\n\"Long-term exposure to excessively high levels of fluoride can cause skeletal fluorosis, which causes pain and damage to bones and joints,\" wrote Webster-Cyriaque. \"Skeletal fluorosis is extremely rare in the US and there is no evidence that it is caused by the recommended level of fluoride in public tap water.\"\nThe American Cancer Society confirms that if someone is exposed to fluoride levels higher than the EPA's primary drinking water standard of 4.0 mg/L for a long period of time, it can cause skeletal fluorosis.\nHow widespread is water fluoridation? Which US states have it?\nThe CDC notes that implementing water fluoridation is decided by state and local governments, and voters are often the ones who decide to adjust water fluoride levels. \"Some states have laws that require water systems of a certain size to provide fluoridated water,\" reports the CDC. \"In some areas, the level of naturally occurring fluoride in water is already at a level proven to prevent cavities.\"\nSince community water systems regularly test public water to comply with regulations and industry standards, fluoride content can be adjusted to reach the optimal level of 0.7 milligrams/liter. The CDC recommends that these fluoride level measurements be conducted daily and verified monthly by an independent state-certified lab.\nThe fluoride level results are then uploaded into the Water Fluoridation Reporting System, which the public can access to see fluoride levels in their area. However, providing this information is voluntary, and not all states participate. To learn more about if there is fluoride in your drinking water (and at what levels), you should contact your community's water provider. If you aren't sure about your water source, ask your dentist, doctor or local health department about getting your water tested for its fluoride level.\nWhat if there is too much or too little fluoride in your water?\n\"Well water can be above the recommended level because fluoride is naturally in rock, and therefore naturally in water. It just isn't controlled as well as community water fluoridation,\" Fisher-Owens tells CNET. \"If the fluoride level in the water is too high, people should look for another source of water if possible. If their water has too little fluoride, children can get prescribed fluoride tablets. Adults can get them, too, depending on health conditions that make them more at risk for problems with their teeth.\"\nTo help with low fluoride levels, dentists and some pediatric doctors can also apply fluoride from visit to visit, according to Fisher-Owens. \"And, of course, this is on top of brushing twice a day with a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste and trying to reduce/eliminate drinking sugar-sweetened beverages and frequent high carbohydrate snacks.\"\nFisher-Owens adds that you can test your water with a commercial test kit or find out if any community programs in your area offer them. The ADA tells CNET that the EPA recommends checking your well water for all major contaminants (anything that isn't hydrogen or oxygen in water) every three years.\nIf your drinking water contains less than 0.7 mg/L of fluoride, the CDC advises that you speak to your dentist and, if you have a child, their pediatrician. They can help you decide if your child could benefit from fluoride toothpaste, mouthwash or supplements.\nFor water that exceeds 2.0 mg/L of fluoride, the EPA recommends that children age 8 and under be given alternative drinking water sources. \"Pregnant people or parents of children who live in areas with higher fluoride concentrations can use low-fluoride bottled water, for instance, to mix infant formula,\" it adds.\nContact your public health department if your water's fluoride level is 4.0 mg/L or more. You should consider using a filter that removes fluoride from drinking and cooking water. Since fluoride is not absorbed through the skin, you don't have to worry about water used for bathing and cleaning.\nFor those with a private water source, the CDC states that less than 1% of the US population has water from private wells or drinking systems with a fluoride level over 2.0 mg/L. The only way the level of fluoride can be found is through laboratory analysis, which your local health department can help you find.\nAre there water filters that remove fluoride?\n\"If water fluoride levels are too high, consider using bottled water for drinking and cooking,\" wrote Jennifer Webster-Cyriaque, DDS, PhD, deputy director of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. \"You can also remove fluoride using a reverse osmosis filter system.\"\nThe CDC states that reverse osmosis water filters remove certain chemicals from water, such as sodium, lead, chloride, copper and chromium. They may also decrease the amount of fluoride, magnesium, calcium, arsenic, sulfate, radium, potassium, phosphorus and nitrate. Check the product's label to see the specific chemicals a water filter removes.\nTo find out exactly what a water filter removes, the CDC specifically recommends looking out for an NSF certification on the label. The National Science Foundation is an independent federal agency that supports science and engineering in US states and territories. It has a database where you can look up reverse osmosis drinking water treatment systems that claim to reduce fluoride. In an email, the EPA also tells CNET that the Water Quality Association provides additional information on certified home water treatment units.\nNotably, fluoride may be included under the total dissolved solids. TDS includes all organic and inorganic materials dissolved in water that are not H2O molecules. For the same reason, fluoride may also be called a contaminant along with magnesium, calcium, iron and more. According to Fisher-Owens, it's also important to know that \"RO filters reduce fluoride by up to 94%, depending on maintenance, including cleanliness of the filters and water pressure in the supply line.\"\nThe EPA defines reverse osmosis as \"the process by which pressure forces water through a semi-permeable membrane, creating a stream of treated water.\" This type of filter can be costly to install and maintain, generate a large quantity of wastewater, remove beneficial minerals and may not remove all contaminants.\nThe EPA recommends selecting a WaterSense-labeled filter to ensure you are wasting less water. Yet, no point-of-use reverse osmosis water treatment systems are listed with a WaterSense label. \"In November 2024, EPA's WaterSense Program released a specification to label point-of-use reverse osmosis systems,\" the EPA tells CNET.\n\"Manufacturers can apply to have their products certified to earn the WaterSense label,\" the EPA says. In other words, the final specification was only recently published, so no point-of-use reverse osmosis systems have received the WaterSense label yet.\nCan you get rid of fluoride by boiling water?\n\"No. Boiled water does not remove fluoride from drinking water,\" the EPA tells CNET.\nDr. Fisher-Owens agrees, adding, \"In fact, boiling slightly increases the fluoride content by boiling off some water (in essence, concentrating the fluoride).\" Reverse osmosis filters, on the other hand, can reduce fluoride by up to 94%.\nAs for the American Dental Association, it tells CNET that boiling can remove viruses or bacteria, but not fluoride. It advises that fluoride can be filtered out with reverse osmosis filtration.\nIs water fluoridation still necessary today?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics states that water fluoridation remains critically important in its Campaign for Dental Health. Tooth decay affects over 90% of Americans by the time they become adults, which is especially significant considering that more than 100 million Americans lack dental insurance.\nThe AAP adds that fluoridated water is the most inexpensive method of providing fluoride, considering that the per-person annual cost of fluoride rinse programs, fluoride supplements and fluoride varnishes is higher than that of providing fluoridated water. The per-person annual cost of fluoride supplements, in particular, is 70 times higher than fluoridated water.\nAt what amount is fluoride considered toxic?\nAccording to the ADA, the single dose of fluoride that could cause acute fluoride toxicity is 5 mg/kg of body weight (11mg/kg of body weight of sodium fluoride). However, it is impossible to get this dose of fluoride from water with fluoride at the optimal level. For a 155-pound adult man to experience acute fluoride toxicity, it would require him to drink almost 120 gallons (more than 1,900 eight-ounce glasses) at one time of water with a fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L.\nShould you be concerned about your child?\nThe American Dental Association describes dental fluorosis as \"a change in the appearance of the tooth enamel that only occurs when younger children consume too much fluoride, from any source, over long periods when teeth are developing under the gums.\" The CDC states that dental fluorosis can cause white flecks, spots or lines on the outer enamel layer. Often, a trained professional is needed to detect these changes (which occur until age 8, when the enamel is fully formed), and even so, the type of fluorosis in the US has no effect on tooth function and may make the teeth more resistant to decay.\nThe ADA also addresses whether it's safe to use fluoridated water to reconstitute infant formula, stating that it is safe. \"If your baby is primarily fed infant formula, using fluoridated water might increase the chance for mild enamel fluorosis, but enamel fluorosis does not affect the health of your child or the health of your child's teeth,\" states the ADA. The American Academy of Pediatrics also states that using fluoridated water to mix formula is safe, but there is a small risk of fluorosis. Most cases are mild, not painful and do not affect the health or function of the teeth.\nTo decrease the chances that your child's teeth will develop fluorosis, the ADA states that you can breastfeed your child, as nursing or pregnant people who consume fluoridated water \"do not pass on significant amounts of fluoride to their child.\" You can also use ready-to-feed formula, which contains little fluoride, or mix powdered or liquid concentrate formula with water that is fluoride-free or contains low concentrations of fluoride. This is often found in bottled waters labeled as purified, de-ionized, demineralized or distilled unless fluoride is listed explicitly as an added ingredient.\nThe FDA's quality standard for fluoride in domestically packaged and imported bottled water is 0.7 mg/L, the same as the CDC's guideline for drinking water. \"Caregivers can reach out to a health care professional and can also check that fluoride levels in their drinking water are at the recommended level: 0.7 mg/L,\" wrote Webster-Cyriaque. \"Levels higher than 1.5 mg/L can increase the risk of dental fluorosis in children younger than 8.\"\nUltimately, the ADA recommends consulting with your child's doctor and dentist to determine what's best for them.\nWhat about fluoride toothpaste and mouthwash?\nThe ADA states that getting the right amount of fluoride is best to decrease the risk of your child developing fluorosis before age 8. Since toothpaste and mouthwash can contribute to a child under 8 developing fluorosis in both non-fluoridated and fluoridated communities, the ADA provides the following recommendations:\nFor children under age 3: Start brushing their teeth once they begin to come into the mouth using an amount of fluoride toothpaste no bigger than the size of a grain of rice.\nFor children aged 3 to 6: Use no more than a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste.\nIn a 2019 report published by the CDC, the organization found that \"40% of children aged 3\u20136 years used too much toothpaste.\" Ensure your child is supervised when brushing their teeth, which should be twice a day or as directed by their dentist or doctor. The CDC also advises that children be supervised to make sure they are spitting out -- not swallowing -- toothpaste after brushing.\nNote that all toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance contain fluoride. In 2021, the World Health Organization added fluoride toothpaste to its list of essential medicines. The CDC states that fluoridated water and toothpaste work better together than alone to prevent cavities, so using both is beneficial. Fluoride toothpaste also provides a higher fluoride concentration at important times of the day, such as bedtime.\nFluoride mouthwash and children\nThe ADA recommends that no child under 6 years old use mouthwash unless directed by a dentist. For those over age 6, the ADA mentioned that a Cochrane systematic review found regular use of fluoride mouthwash decreased tooth decay in children even if they were exposed to other fluoride sources.\nNonetheless, you should always consult your dentist before changing your child's oral health care routine. In general, the ADA reports that manufacturers producing fluoride mouthwash must demonstrate fluoride concentration and other parameters to ensure they comply with current guidelines.\nPregnant people and fluoride\nIn areas where fluoridated water exceeds the EPA-recommended level of 2.0 mg/L, the EPA recommends that pregnant people use low-fluoride bottled water. The ADA states that nursing or pregnant people who drink fluoridated water \"do not pass on significant amounts of fluoride to their child.\"\nA National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements fact sheet on fluoride for health professionals reports that the Food and Nutrition Board's daily tolerable upper intake level for fluoride is 10 mg for pregnant and lactating people ages 14 to 51. This is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects.\nIn May 2024, the Keck School of Medicine of USC published the first US study of fluoride exposure during pregnancy, with 220 mother-child pairs participating. It found that women exposed to higher levels of fluoride during pregnancy tended to rate their 3-year-olds high on overall neurobehavioral problems and internalizing symptoms such as emotional reactivity, anxiety and somatic complaints.\nSpecifically, a 0.68 mg/L increase in fluoride exposure was examined to nearly double the chance of a child showing neurobehavioral problems close to or within a range that meets clinical diagnosis criteria. \"While this is the first US-based study of fluoride exposure during pregnancy, more studies are urgently needed to understand and mitigate the impacts in the entire US population,\" said Ashley Malin, PhD, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida and lead author of the study.\nWhen discussing evidence suggesting that higher fluoride intakes during early development may be connected to lower IQ and cognitive impairments in children, the National Institutes of Health states that many experts \"consider this evidence to be weak and methodologically flawed\" and that additional research is warranted. This assessment does not specifically address the Keck School of Medicine of USC study, but the fact sheet was last updated on June 26, 2024, which is after the study was published on May 20, 2024.\nWhen asked about this study, Fisher-Owens states, \"I respect colleagues from USC, but in this study, they use spot measurements of fluoride instead of 24-hour urine samples; spot urines can vary a lot on the same person throughout the day, so it's less reliable to use in a study. Also, they did not statistically 'control' for actual tap water consumption or other factors that could be associated with changes in neurobehavior.\"\nFisher-Owens explains that there is ongoing research on this topic, but in the meantime, \"We know from other research that having healthy teeth and mouth during pregnancy can help decrease chances of premature and low birth weight babies.\" She adds that pregnant people can be more at risk for certain oral health problems -- due to increased snacking and vomiting along with hormonal changes, especially since some pregnant people may be afraid to get dental care during pregnancy. However, Fisher-Owens states that it is safe.\nAccording to the ADA, after reviewing the USC study, numerous medical experts found it lacking in scientific credibility. \"The researchers examined only a small homogenous group of mothers (low-income, urban Hispanic women) and used only one measurement of mothers' fluoride intake (urinary fluoride) during pregnancy,\" the association tells CNET. \"Other researchers have noted that this is not a reliable indicator of fluoride intake.\"\nThe ADA goes on to state that the USC study did not examine children's intake of fluoride, lead or arsenic and did not look at social measures that can influence a child's IQ and behavior, including poverty, parents' IQ and caretakers' educational level. The association concluded by saying that medical experts from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology did not think this was a credible study.\nWhen asked about this study, the EPA states, \"EPA has not reviewed this new study. However, the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to review each national primary drinking water regulation at least once every six years and revise them, if appropriate. The Agency will consider new peer-reviewed science in future assessments of fluoride in drinking water.\"\nShould pregnant people drink bottled water?\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, \"Unless there are concerns about tap water contamination, bottled water is not preferred to tap water during pregnancy.\" The academy adds that the fluoride amount is not required to be listed on bottled water labels unless the manufacturer makes a claim about the product's fluoride content.\nDr. Fisher-Owens explains that bottled water is not regulated as precisely as community drinking water fluoridation. There may also be contaminants in the bottled water that provide no benefits. \"Pregnant people should do their best to eat healthy, brush their teeth and check with their perinatal providers on what is best for their circumstances,\" advises Dr. Fisher-Owens.\nWhat foods is fluoride in?\n\"Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride,\" explains the National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements.\nBecause tea plants intake fluoride from soil, brewed tea usually contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods. This depends on the tea type and source. In brewed tea made with distilled water, fluoride levels can range from 0.3 to 6.5 mg/L.\nThe National Institutes of Health lists the following after brewed tea, in order of having the most milligrams per serving of fluoride to the least:\n- Coffee, brewed\n- Shrimp, canned\n- Bottled water with added fluoride\n- Raisins\n- Oatmeal, cooked\n- Grapefruit juice\n- Potatoes, russet, baked\n- Rice, cooked\n- Cottage cheese\n- Pork chop, baked\n- Yogurt, plain, low-fat\n- Lambchop, cooked\nThese are only a few examples, for which you can find the fluoride content amount here. The amount of fluoride present in food and beverages may vary based on the fluoride levels in the water used for preparation.\nThe bottom line\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Dental Association and American Academy of Pediatrics consider the US Public Health Service's recommended 0.7 mg/L of fluoride in drinking water safe. To see the fluoride level in your water system, check the Water Fluoridation Reporting System, call your water provider or have your water tested.\nIf fluoride is above the recommended amount, consider using a reverse osmosis filter or bottled water that is purified, de-ionized, demineralized or distilled in which fluoride is not explicitly listed as an added ingredient. If it is below the recommended amount, consult your dentist or doctor for advice. If you have any additional questions specific to your or your child's health, your best bet is to consult your doctor, dentist or pediatrician.\nCorrection, Feb. 4: Fluorine is the 13th most common element on earth, of which fluoride is the ionic form."

      "text": "Dental cleanings are essential for maintaining optimal oral health and function. During these visits, a dental hygienist will clean, polish and floss your teeth to remove hardened plaque, tartar and bacteria. When combined with diligent brushing and flossing at home, dental cleanings help achieve and maintain healthy teeth and gums.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nDental cleanings are key to maintaining healthy teeth and gums. During a dental cleaning, a dentist or dental hygienist will remove bacteria, plaque and tartar buildup from your teeth surfaces. They may also perform other preventive services during the same visit, such as dental sealants and fluoride treatments.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nIf you have dental fears or anxieties, talk to your dentist. Many providers offer sedation dentistry options to help you stay comfortable and relaxed during your visit.\nThere are different types of dental cleanings, based on your needs. But all have the same end goal \u2014 to remove harmful bacteria and reduce your risk for dental issues.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the American Dental Association, people should schedule teeth cleanings at regular intervals recommended by their dentist. For many people, this will be every six months. But that could change based on your unique oral health needs.\nDental cleanings always involve scaling and polishing your teeth. Depending on your needs, your dentist or hygienist may also recommend other diagnostic and preventive treatments.\nTreatments commonly performed during a dental cleaning include:\nDuring this step, your dentist or hygienist will use hand instruments called scalers to remove plaque and tartar from your teeth surfaces. In some instances, they may also use an ultrasonic scaler, which vibrates and sprays a jet of water. You might hear scraping sounds during this step, but it shouldn\u2019t hurt.\nYour dentist or hygienist will polish your teeth using a soft rubber cup and a special paste or pumice. This removes the biofilm on your teeth surfaces and reduces plaque buildup without damaging your enamel.\nDepending on your unique oral health needs, your dentist or hygienist may recommend other preventive services like dental sealants or fluoride treatments. If you have back teeth (premolars or molars) with deep grooves or crevices, dental sealants can help protect these areas from harmful, cavity-causing bacteria. Fluoride treatments help strengthen your enamel and reduce your risk for cavities. Children and adults alike can benefit from sealants and fluoride treatments. Ask your dentist if these preventive treatments are right for you.\nMost people need new dental X-rays every six to 36 months. However, if you have an issue that requires regular monitoring, you may need more frequent X-rays. Routine X-rays are essential for the diagnosis and treatment of dental conditions.\nIf your dentist or hygienist finds anything concerning during your dental cleaning \u2014 such as cavities or gum disease \u2014 they\u2019ll discuss your treatment options with you in detail.\nOn average, routine dental cleanings take between 30 minutes and an hour. If you\u2019re undergoing debridement or scaling and root planing, it could take longer.\nRoutine dental cleanings offer a number of benefits, including:\nAdvertisement\nDental cleanings are safe and effective. While there aren\u2019t any risks or complications, you may experience some temporary side effects, such as teeth sensitivity or sore gums.\nTo manage discomfort, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, naproxen or ibuprofen. Tenderness should go away in a few days.\nDental cleanings are a necessary part of oral healthcare. Preventive treatments are much more affordable than restorative treatments like fillings, crowns or bridges. Teeth cleanings reduce your risk for common oral health issues. This means they can actually help you save money overall.\nYou should schedule routine cleanings with your dentist or hygienist at least once every six months. Ask your dentist if twice-a-year cleanings are right for you.

      "text": "Abstract\nObjective\nThis in situ study compared the effectiveness of two toothpastes containing hydroxyapatite or 500 ppm fluoride in promoting remineralization and inhibiting caries development.\nMaterials and methods\nTwo enamel blocks (human primary teeth), one sound and one with artificially-produced caries lesion, were exposed to toothpaste containing either 10% hydroxyapatite or 500 ppm F\u2212 (amine fluoride) via intra-oral appliance worn by 30 adults in two-arm double blind randomized crossover study lasting 14 days per arm (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03681340). Baseline and post-test mineral loss and lesion depth (LD) were quantified using microradiography. One-sided t-test of one group mean was used for intragroup comparison (baseline vs. post-test), while two-sided t-test of two independent means was used to compare the two toothpaste groups.\nResults\nPairwise comparison (baseline vs. test) indicated significant (p < 0.0001) remineralization and LD reduction by either toothpaste; however, when compared against each other, there was no statistically significant difference in remineralization or LD reduction between the two toothpastes. No demineralization could be observed in sound enamel blocks exposed to either toothpaste. While F\u2212 induced lesion surface lamination, HAP produced a more homogenous lesion remineralization.\nConclusions\n10% hydroxyapatite achieved comparable efficacy with 500 ppm F\u2212 in remineralizing initial caries and preventing demineralization. Thus the HAP toothpaste is confirmed to be equal to the fluoride toothpaste in this study.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nAlthough preventable, dental caries continues to be one of the most prevalent chronic diseases among children in the U.S. and the world, and one of the most common unmet healthcare needs of poor children.1 As much as 80% of caries incidence is experienced by only 20\u201325% of children, with 10% having untreated cavities, and those from low socioeconomic and minority groups experiencing significantly higher rates and at younger ages.2,3\nIt is well documented that saliva has a caries protective effects due to its supersaturation with Ca2+ and PO43\u2013 ions in a bioavailable form and enrichment with various proteins playing multiple roles in maintenance of hard tissue integrity throughout life.4 Furthermore, the supersaturation of saliva with Ca2+ and PO43\u2013 ions, at physiological pH, ensures that these ions are bioavailable to diffuse into mineral deficient lesions to induce remineralization.5 However, the natural caries protective and remineralizing effects of saliva is not only a slow process but obviously insufficient to protect individuals against caries and remineralize existing lesions without additional agents to enhance its effects.\nAlthough fluoride interventions seem to have the most consistent benefit in preventing caries development and remineralizing initial lesions with the highest level of supporting evidence,6,7,8 caries still develop in high risk individuals of all ages, irrespective of the dose of fluoride used.9,10 There are limitations to what application of fluoride alone can achieve in relation to caries prevention and remineralization.11 These limitations may be associated with facts that fluoride becomes less effective below a pH of about 4.5;12 fluoride still needs Ca2+ and PO43\u2013 ions in a bioavailable form in saliva and other sources to be effective; and fluoride remineralization of initial lesions is most effective at the outer 30 \u03bcm of the lesion,13,14 thus leading to surface-zone remineralization at the expense of the lesion body, making full remineralization difficult to achieve.15,16 Furthermore, although the efficacy of fluoride is dose-dependent and increases with increase dose,7 there is a limit to which you can increase the dosage of fluoride to avoid the risk of fluorosis in children17 and toxicity in all ages.18,19 The effect of dose limitation on fluoride effectiveness may be more pronounced in children below 6 years, since the fluoride dose recommended for this group is even lower than the regulatory 1000\u20131500 ppm fluoride concentration in non-prescription toothpastes, and as such probably suboptimal for effective remineralization of initial lesions.\nThe above mentioned limitations of the saliva homeostatic mechanisms and fluoride-based strategies in caries prevention and remineralization, especially in highly cariogenic oral environments justify the need for new-age strategies that could work either better than or as effective as fluoride but can permit increasing dosage for increase effectiveness without safety concerns. It is envisaged that the presence of additional extrinsic sources of stabilized Ca2+ and PO43\u2013 ions could augment the natural caries preventive and remineralization potential of saliva by increasing diffusion gradients favoring faster and deeper subsurface remineralization.20 One of the new caries remineralizing technologies is the biomimetic systems, among which are the synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP; Ca5(PO4)3(OH) applied in microcluster or nanocrystalline forms in oral care products.21,22 HAP is a bioactive and biocompatible material with similar chemical composition to the apatite crystals of human enamel.21,22,23,24 Several in vitro and in situ studies have provided evidences supporting the caries remineralization and prevention potential of HAP in oral care products based on its demonstrated ability to strongly adsorb to tooth surfaces, plaque components and bacteria.24,25,26,27,28,29 Randomized controlled clinical trials, some of which have led to the approval of HAP as an anti-caries agent in Japan in 1993 and in Canada in 2015, have demonstrated its non-inferiority and equivalence to fluoride.30,31,32 Therefore, the objective of this in situ study was to determine whether Karex Kid\u2019s toothpaste containing 10% HAP microclusters (Kinder Karex Zahnpasta, Dr. Kurt Wolff GmbH and Co. KG, Bielefeld, Germany) is as effective as Elmex Kid\u2019s toothpaste containing 500 ppm fluoride as amine fluoride (Elmex Kinder Zahnpasta, CP GABA GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) in promoting the remineralization and inhibiting the development of carious lesions. We hypothesized that (1) each of the two toothpaste formulations promotes remineralization and lesion depth reduction that is significantly greater than zero, and (2) neither toothpaste is inferior to the other with respect to promoting the remineralization and inhibiting the development of carious lesions.\nMaterials and methods\nThis is a double-blind, randomized, crossover, single center, controlled in situ study to establish the equivalence of two children toothpaste formulations, containing either 10% HAP microclusters (crystallite size: length \u2248 80 nm (median) \u00d7 width \u2248 30 nm (median)) or 500 ppm fluoride provided as amine fluoride (AMF), in inducing the remineralization and inhibiting the development of initial caries lesions. The primary outcomes to be examined were (1) the percentage remineralization and lesion depth reduction measured relative to the baseline mineral loss and lesion depth for initial caries, and (2) the amount of mineral loss and lesion depth for the sound enamel. The study was conducted at the clinical research facility of the University of Texas Health San Antonio (UTHSA) School of Dentistry. The UTHSA Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study (protocol #: HSC20180416H), and the study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03681340). The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards outlined in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments, and in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The participants were recruited from among different ethnic origins and varied socio-economic status in the local San Antonio area, written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their participation in the study.\nParticipant recruitment\nFifty subjects aged from 18 to 60 years were given screening examination that included sialometry, medical/dental history, and oral examination (Fig. 1). Thirty two subjects qualified and were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were age of 18 through 60 years; normal salivary function with unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates \u22650.2 ml/min and \u22650.7 ml/min, respectively, measured according to the Sreebny and Valdini33 procedure. Other inclusion criteria were not taking any antibiotics or medications which could affect saliva flow rate; the presence of at least 20 natural uncrowned teeth (excluding third molars); a past history of dental caries but no clinically active caries; willing to wear the in situ appliance and use only assigned products for oral hygiene throughout the duration of the study; the ability to read and understand English; ability to provide informed consent; and no self-reported history of allergy to personal care/consumer products or any ingredient in the test products. Exclusion criteria were the presence of advanced periodontal disease or other oral pathology; medical condition that requires premedication prior to dental procedures; use of antibiotics one month prior to or during this study; self-reported pregnancy or breastfeeding; and use of tobacco products.\nCreation of artificial initial caries and fabrication of the in situ appliance\nFollowing consent from the donors, freshly extracted primary teeth were collected from the pediatric clinics of the UTHSA School of dentistry and stored in 0.1% thymol solution at 4 \u00b0C prior to use. The teeth were examined with a transilluminator, and thirty two teeth without caries, cracks, or enamel malformations were selected and cleaned with pumice using electronic toothbrush. Using a water-cooled diamond wire saw, 4 tooth blocks were produced from buccal and lingual surfaces of each of the selected teeth, with each block measuring ~2 mm length \u00d7 2 mm width \u00d7 1.5 mm thickness. Two of the 4 blocks were retained as sound enamel blocks for demineralization inhibition assessment while the other two blocks targeted for remineralization assessment had artificial initial caries produced in them as follows. All surfaces of each block were painted with two coats of acid resistant nail varnish except buccal or lingual on which an initial caries lesion was created by subjecting this exposed surface to 7 days demineralization in an acidified gel system (0.10 M lactic acid, 0.10 M sodium hydroxide, 6% w/v hydroxyethyl cellulose, pH 4.5). Following lesion formation, the nail varnish was carefully removed with acetone. A tooth section (~150 \u00b5m thick) was cut from each tooth block for the measurement of the baseline mineral loss (\u2206z1) and lesion depth (LD1) of each produced initial caries lesion, and for selection of the suitable lesions for the remineralization assessment. The sections were processed for transverse microradiography (TMR) as follows. Both sides of the sections were polished using adhesive back lapping film in a MultiPrep\u2122 Precision Polishing machine (Allied High Tech, USA) to achieve planoparallel surfaces, as well as reduce the thickness of the slice to 100 \u00b5m (the appropriate thickness for TMR). Following this, the sections were microradiographed on a type lA high resolution glass X-ray plate (Microchrome Technology, CA, USA) using a Phillips X-ray generator system set up for this purpose. The plates were exposed for 10 min at an anode voltage of 20 kV and a tube current of 10 mA, and then processed. Processing consisted of a 5 min development in Kodak HR developer and 15 min fixation in Kodak Rapid-fixer before a final 30 min wash period. After drying, the microradiographs were examined under a Leica DMR optical microscope linked via a Sony model XC-75CE CCTV camera to a personal computer. Using TMR2006 version 3.0.0.11 image analysis software (Inspektor Research Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands), the enhanced image of the microradiographs were analyzed under standard conditions of light intensity and magnification along with the image of a step wedge as described by de Josselin de Jong et al.34 At this point, the images were used only for selection of the suitable lesions for the study. Only the controls that showed caries-like lesions with subsurface lesions, which display a fairly uniform width throughout their length, were selected for the remineralization process, and their test blocks were used for construction of the in situ appliance. It is pertinent to mention that the baseline measurements were not conducted for the sound tooth blocks to be used for demineralization-prevention study because the TMR does not measure the mineral density of sound tooth tissue rather the software uses the known mineral density of sound enamel or dentin to determine the amount of mineral loss in a demineralized tissue.\nAs stated above, the four tooth blocks from each tooth were distributed as follows: two lesion-bearing blocks for remineralization assessment and two sound blocks for demineralization inhibition assessment. These four blocks were used to fabricate the in situ appliances as follows. Each block was covered with polyester gauze (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA) and mounted within an in situ appliance, a customized orthodontic bracket.27 The polyester gauze facilitated plaque retention on the surface of the tooth blocks on intra-oral exposure. The appliance consists of an orthodontic molar pad with retentive mesh backing (American Orthodontics Corp., Sheboygan, US), which has a ring of 0.7 mm orthodontic wire welded to it so that the ring closely encircles each test-block. The block was retained within the bracket with fluoride-free intermediate restorative material (IRM). All appliances were sterilized with gamma irradiation prior to delivery to the subject.\nStudy treatment\nThe study was performed in two distinct treatment phases during which subjects were exposed to one of the following two treatments in a randomized crossover design; (A) Karex Kid\u2019s toothpaste containing 10% HAP microclusters (Kinder Karex, Dr. Kurt Wolff GmbH and Co. KG, Bielefeld, Germany), and (B) Elmex Kid\u2019s toothpaste containing 500 ppm fluoride as AMF (Elmex Kinder zahnpasta, GABA GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Each phase started with one week of washout period and then 4 weeks of treatment, consisting of two 2-week periods during which each subject used his/her assigned treatment under the following conditions. First 2-week period, with the subject wearing an in situ appliance with sound enamel block, and the second 2-week period, with the subject wearing an in situ appliance with lesion-bearing tooth block.\nSubjects who satisfied enrollment criteria were given a specially manufactured washout toothpaste with neither fluoride nor HAP (Dr. Kurt Wolff GmbH and Co. KG, Bielefeld, Germany) and an adult soft-bristled toothbrush to use for a washout period of one week. The washout period allows for attenuation of any residual effect of the subject's previously used toothpaste. There was no washout period between individual 2-week treatment periods within each phase since the subjects used the same product for the 4 weeks. During the washout period, subjects were instructed to use the toothpaste and toothbrush for 2 min twice a day (morning after breakfast and night last thing before bed) in place of their normally used toothpaste and toothbrush, and as their only oral hygiene product. Subjects were given no restriction on dietary habit.\nAt the end of the washout period, patients returned to the clinic, and were assigned to a group to use either HAP or AMF by the Study Coordinator using randomization numbers generated by a computer program designed and operated by our biostatistics team. However, to ensure that both the operators and the subjects were blinded as to product assignment, all toothpaste tubes were packaged identically and coded (A, B, or washout) by the manufacturing/packaging company, who retained the code until the completion of the study and data interpretation. Following randomization, the 4 block-bearing in situ appliances originating from one tooth were assigned to one subject. Then the first of the four assigned appliances was bonded, in accordance with current principles of orthodontic practice, on the buccal surface of the chosen lower molar tooth. The appliance was bonded by a qualified dentist licensed in the state of Texas, who was different from the laboratory technician that process and analyze the samples to produce the final data. To bond the appliance, the buccal surface of the tooth chosen was carefully etched for 30 s, washed with water spray and dried for a further 30 s, and isolated using cotton rolls. The bottom of the appliance was loaded with Transbond\u2122 XT light-cure adhesive paste (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA), and carefully positioned to avoid causing occlusal interference and to avoid soft tissue irritation. The excess composite material that spilled out from the sides of the appliance was used to cover the sides, beveling it to present a comfortable streamlined (non-catching) surface when the slab comes in contact with a soft tissue surface (e.g., tongue). The adhesive paste was cured using an Ortholux XT visible Light Curing Unit (3M Unitek, Monrovia, Ca, USA) applied for 20 s.\nFollowing bonding of the appliance, each subject was given his/her respective test toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush designed for use with orthodontic brackets with shorter bristles at the center to accommodate the bracket. Subjects were instructed to continue with the routine of brushing two times daily, morning after breakfast and last thing before bed, for 2 min before rinsing with only 10 ml of water. Subjects were also given special instruction on dispensing of the toothpaste, and were advised not to brush directly on the appliance but rather to brush around it to prevent disruption of the dental plaque on the surface of the tooth block. Subjects were restricted from eating nor drinking for at least 30 min after brushing. A timer and measuring cup were provided to each subject. As a method of monitoring compliance, a diary was provided to each subject for recording the time of each brushing episode, and in addition, toothpaste tubes were weighed at the time of randomization and at each study visit. Subjects were instructed to maintain their normal dietary habits and were prohibited from using any other oral hygiene product (e.g., mouthwash, chewing gum) or tooth-whitening product for the duration of the study. Immediately after bonding of the first appliance, each subject used the test product under the supervision of the Study Coordinator, and for the remainder of each treatment phase, subjects completed the procedure at home and as instructed by the Study Coordinator\nSubjects returned to the clinical research facility after 2 weeks without using the product that morning, and the first appliance was detached and sent to the laboratory for analysis. The appliance for the second 2-week treatment period of the phase was bonded, the dairy checked, the toothpaste weighed, and safety evaluation performed. Upon completion of the second 2-week treatment period, the subject again returned to the clinic for detachment of the second appliance, and was given washout toothpaste and a soft-bristle toothbrush to undergo another 7-day washout period without an appliance in preparation for his/her phase 2 of the study. After completion of the washout period without an appliance, subjects return to the clinic, and the procedure of phase 1 was repeated until the second 2-week treatment period was completed, and each subject has gone through the two arms of the study.\nSafety monitoring\nAt all visits, the dental examiner visually examines the oral cavity and peri-oral area, and this examination included an evaluation of the soft and hard palate, gingival mucosa, buccal mucosa, mucogingival fold areas, tongue, sublingual and submandibular areas, salivary glands, and the tonsillar and pharyngeal areas. In addition to oral examination, subjects were screened for adverse events using a questionnaire.\nPost-treatment processing and study outcomes\nFollowing intra-oral exposure, a tooth section (~150 \u00b5m thick) was cut from each tooth block, both sound and lesion-bearing blocks. The sections were processed for microradiography as described above for the control sections used for baseline data. Although the lesion-bearing control sections have been microradiographed and analyzed for selection of the appropriate lesions, they were microradiographed again together with the post-test sections and both analyzed together for quantification of the \u2206z and LD of the lesions as described for baseline sections. This step enabled both control and test sections from same block to be microradiographed and analyzed under the same conditions. For the lesion-bearing sections, this process yielded the pre-test mineral loss (\u2206z1) and lesion depth (LD1), the post-test mineral loss (\u2206z2), and lesion depth (LD2), and the pre-test and post-test microradiograms of the lesions. For the sections from sound tooth blocks, the process yielded the post-test mineral loss (\u2206z) and lesion depth (LD) if any lesion developed, and the microradiograms. Using the microradiograms, the pattern and the extent of remineralization produced within each lesion by each treatment arm was examined by comparing the pre-test and post-test images side-by-side. For each participant the post-treatment mineral loss was subtracted from the pre-treatment mineral loss, and then standardized across participants by dividing that difference by the pre-treatment mineral loss to obtain the % remineralization. The lesion depth pre-treatment and post-treatment was handled the same way to obtain the % lesion depth reduction. The two products were compared using the % remineralization and the % lesion depth reduction.\nPower analysis and sample size calculation\nThe sample size calculations, which were based on a power analysis, were performed using nQuery Advisor software (Statistical Solutions, Cork, Ireland). Based on previous studies in which the mean % remineralization was equal to 30.3 with a standard deviation equal to 16.3,27,35,36,37 and for the hypothesis that each of the two toothpaste formulations promotes remineralization and lesion depth reduction that is significantly greater than zero, an effective sample size of 30 subjects will have power greater than 0.95 with a 0.05 one-sided significance level to detect a difference between a hypothesis mean of zero and a sample mean % remineralization equal to or greater than 10% using a two-sided t-test of two independent means. However, 32 subjects were enrolled to make provision for 5% dropout.\nStatistical analysis\nFor measurements by both mineral loss and lesion depth, three endpoints were analyzed. (1) The mean amount of remineralization and mean amount of lesion depth reduction were determined for Karex toothpaste as a percentage of pre-treatment mineral loss and pre-treatment lesion depth respectively, and these percentages were compared to a value of 0%, which is what would be expected if the toothpaste had no effect. The statistical test used was a one-sided t-test of one group mean. (2) In the same way, the mean amount of remineralization and mean amount of lesion depth reduction was determined for Elmex toothpaste, and also compared to 0%. (3) Finally, the primary endpoint was to compare the means of Karex toothpaste to Elmex toothpaste to check for non-inferiority/equivalence of the HAP toothpaste to the fluoride toothpaste, using the two-sided t-test of two independent means. Non-inferiority/equivalence was established if the difference between the two toothpaste formulations for any one measurement method was not regarded to be clinically relevant and was set to \u0394 \u2264 20%. The statistical package R, version 3.5.0, was used for analysis.\nResults\nOf the 32 subjects recruited into this study, 1 subject declined to participate further during the washout period, and one other subject declined to participate midway into the first 2-week treatment while wearing his first appliance that bears sound tooth block (Fig. 1). Thirty subjects (19 females, 11 males) with a mean (SD) age of 39.5 (15.0) years completed the study. The unstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates of the subjects ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 ml/min and 0.9 to 3.5 ml/min respectively. The ethnic distribution of the subjects was as follows: Hispanic 17 (57%), Black (not Hispanic) 3 (10%), White (not Hispanic) 7 (23%), Asian 1 (3%), and others 2 (7%).\nThe mean rates of remineralization and lesion depth reduction are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Each toothpaste had a mean percent remineralization in excess of 50%, and a mean percent lesion depth reduction better than 25%. For both toothpastes, the mean % remineralization and mean % lesion depth reduction were statistically significantly greater than 0% (p < 0.0001). When compared against each other, there was no statistically significant difference in remineralization (p = 0.81), or in lesion depth reduction (p = 0.68). The 95% confidence interval of the difference between Karex\u2122 (HAP) and Elmex (AMF) for remineralization was \u22128.8% to +6.5%, and the 95% confidence interval of the difference for lesion depth reduction was \u22126.8% to +4.1%. Therefore, in this study the HAP toothpaste is confirmed to be non-inferior to the fluoride toothpaste in effectiveness.\nOn analysis of the sound tooth blocks that examined the ability of the two toothpastes to inhibit demineralization of sound tooth surface, there was no evidence of demineralization in any of the tooth blocks following intra-oral exposure to either toothpaste (Fig. 2a, b) and (Fig. 3a, b). Critical examination of the microradiograms from the lesion-bearing samples exposed to HAP (Fig. 4a, b) and AMF (Fig. 5a, b) toothpastes in comparison with their respective control microradiograms, shows that while HAP induced a more homogenous remineralization distributed throughout the entire thickness of the subsurface lesion (Fig. 4b), the remineralization induced by AMF was denser in the out half (surface zone) of the lesion (lesion surface lamination) i.e., two zones of contrasting density can clearly be observed (Fig. 5b). These remineralization patterns in Fig. 4b and 5b were consistent in all specimens exposed to HAP and AMF respectively. There were no incidences of adverse effects reported by subjects or ascertained clinically.\nDiscussion\nDespite being a preventable disease and amid the presence of fluoride in oral dentifrices, dental caries prevalence in children continues to increase globally,1 and at a faster rate among children from low socioeconomic backgrounds.38 This indicates that although fluoride interventions have the highest level of supporting evidence as having the most consistent benefit in preventing caries and remineralizing initial caries lesions;6,7,8 additional remineralizing and preventive agents are often needed to enhance fluoride effects in high caries risk individuals.9,10 One may suggest increasing the dose of fluoride since its effectiveness is dose-dependent,7 unfortunately, there is a limit to fluoride dose allowed in oral care products to avoid the risk of fluorosis in children17 and toxicity in all ages.18,19 The fluoride dose recommended for toddlers and children is even lower than the regulatory 1000\u20131500 ppm fluoride concentration in non-prescription toothpastes, which is probably suboptimal for effective remineralization of initial lesions; thus the effect of dose limitation on fluoride effectiveness may be more pronounced in toddlers and children below 6 years. Besides safety concerns, higher fluoride dose in remineralization materials results to surface-zone remineralization at the expense of the lesion body, thus preventing fuller and homogenous remineralization of the lesion.15,16 It is envisaged that an agent as effective as fluoride, but can permit increasing dosage for increase effectiveness without safety concerns, may offer a more effective choice, especially for children. Hydroxyapatite, a bioactive and biocompatible material with wide applications in both medicine (e.g., bone substitute) and dentistry, is currently used in nanocrystaline or microcluster forms in toothpaste and mouthrinses in varying concentrations for caries prevention and remineralization.23,24,25 The equivalence (non-inferiority) of 10% HAP in microcluster forms to 500 ppm fluoride provided as AMF in remineralization of initial caries lesion and inhibition of sound enamel demineralization was investigated in this study. The findings of the present in situ study accepted the two hypotheses that each of the two toothpaste formulations promotes remineralization and lesion depth reduction that is significantly greater than zero, and that neither toothpaste is inferior to the other with respect to promoting the remineralization and inhibiting the development of initial caries lesions. Although this study was conducted with human primary teeth, similar result was observed in a previous in situ study that used human permanent teeth.27 A randomized controlled clinical trial in children and adolescents at high caries risk undergoing orthodontic treatment also reported similar results and non-inferiority of microcrystalline HAP to 1400 ppm fluoride provided as AMF and stannous fluoride.32 Effectiveness of AMF in these reports and this study is in agreement with the long-established fact that fluoride in varying concentrations are effective in preventing caries development and remineralizing initial caries,9,39,40 and that the various fluoride salts were equally effective.41 Furthermore, Hellwig et al.42 in an in situ study demonstrated the remineralization of initial caries lesions of permanent teeth, and concluded that remineralization of primary teeth with fluorides may be possible in the same way as the permanent teeth. The effectiveness of the HAP toothpaste in this study is in agreement with previous clinical and in vitro studies, and it is not surprising considering the various mechanisms through which HAP has been demonstrated to effect remineralization of initial caries.25,27,28,32,43,44,45,46,47 Based on its strong affinity and adsorption to tooth surfaces,24,26,43 HAP has been shown to induce remineralization of initial caries lesions by directly filling micropores in demineralized tooth surfaces,26,48 where it acts as a crystal nucleus, and promotes crystal deposition and growth by continuously attracting large amounts of calcium and phosphate ions from the surrounding remineralization solution.48,49\nThe absence of any evidence of demineralization in all the sound tooth blocks following intra-oral exposure to either HAP or AMF toothpaste further demonstrated the inhibition of demineralization by both toothpastes. The caries prevention potential of HAP, which has been established in previous studies,31,32 has been shown to be based on multiple mechanisms. HAP in toothpaste has been reported to elevate calcium and phosphate ions concentrations in saliva, plaque and tooth surfaces;50 thus acting as a calcium and phosphate reservoir, helping to maintain a topical state of supersaturation of these ions with respect to tooth minerals.43,51 The discussed mechanism must have applied in this study considering that the surface of the tooth blocks was covered with polyesther gauze, which encouraged and maintained plaque accumulation over the tooth surface, providing a nest for the accumulations of the mineral ions. The high potential of HAP to adsorb to bacterial cell wall has been shown to facilitate an antibiofilm effect by inducing coaggregation of bacteria within the HAP particles,46 thus aiding biofilm removal from the tooth surfaces,52,53 and hindering oral biofilm formation.29,46,47,54 Again, this mechanism may have contributed the present findings by limiting the virulence of the biofilm on the surface of the tooth blocks.\nThe findings in this study further confirmed the surface zone remineralization by the fluoride agents.13,14,55 Two zones of contrasting density can clearly be seen in Fig. 5b, showing the remineralization induced by AMF to be denser in the out half of the lesion (surface zone). Observation of such surface zone remineralization with only 500 ppm fluoride present in the toothpaste used in this study actually demonstrated that this \u2018lesion lamination\u2019 effect is not limited to materials with high fluoride concentration, rather it is based on the established fact that fluoride remineralization of initial lesions, irrespective of the concentration, is most effective at the outer 30 \u03bcm of the lesion.13,14,55 This is supported by the findings of a previous study, which reported that higher fluoride concentrations did not produce any further significant increase in remineralization, rather laminations (surface zone remineralization) were apparent in lesions subjected to the 250-ppm and 500-ppm F\u2212 solutions.55 Another in situ study demonstrated no significant difference in the effectiveness of 500, 1000, and 1500 ppm fluoride in remineralizing initial caries in primary teeth,42 further confirming the effect of lesion lamination. The findings of these previous studies and the lesion lamination effect demonstrate that the dose-dependent effect of fluoride effectiveness that reflects as increased effect of high fluoride toothpaste41 or addition of further fluoride sources,56 has limit at which it plateaus and further increase may not improve the effectiveness. In contrast to the effect of AMF, Fig. 4b shows that HAP induced a more homogenous remineralization distributed throughout the entire thickness of the subsurface lesion, and this may indicate that increasing the dose of HAP or continued usage of the toothpaste may result to increased remineralization of the lesion, and ultimately lead to complete or fuller remineralization of the initial lesion.\nBased on above discussions one may suggest that HAP-containing toothpaste may be a better choice for children and individuals at high caries risk since the dosage can be increased to obtain higher efficacy without any safety issue such as the risk of fluorosis in children associated with high fluoride dose. Furthermore, the use of HAP in oral care products may eliminate the need of combining fluoride and antimicrobials in a dentifrice, as well as having different dosages for infants, children and adults. It is logical but scientific that since the remineralizing efficacy of topical fluorides is strictly dependent on the availability of calcium and phosphate ions, HAP dentifrices may be a more effective for xerostomic patients with diminished amounts of saliva. This may need to be confirm through a clinical trial on patients suffering from xerostomia.\nIn this study, there was no incidences of adverse effects reported by subjects or ascertained clinically. Previous clinical studies observed similar findings, and reported there is no safety issue with HAP in oral care products.27,32,57 The fact that these studies investigated varying doses of HAP in toothpastes, and none reported any safety issue, confirms that the dose of HAP in oral care dentifrices can be safely increased for an increase effectiveness when necessary.\nConclusion\n-\nThis study confirmed hydroxyapatite toothpaste is equivalent or non-inferior to the fluoride toothpaste with respect to remineralization of initial caries lesions and prevention of carious lesion development.\n-\nFuture research should be large multicenter clinical trials to further establish the effectiveness of HAP dentifrices and its equivalence to fluoride.\nReferences\nKassebaum, N.

      "text": "It can be hard to keep up with the recommended two-minute daily brushing sessions for optimal dental hygiene. An electric toothbrush is an easy upgrade for a deeper clean, thanks to an oscillating or vibrating brush head. Our team tested 24 of the best electric toothbrushes to find the right fit for you, whether you're focused on replacement brush head cost or gentle bristles.\nOur Picks\n\"[Electric toothbrushes] can aid in proper scrubbing technique, reach hard-to-reach areas and provide controlled, consistent movements,\u201d Dr. Jennifer Silver, a dentist in Calgary, Alberta, told CNET.\nWhat is the best overall electric toothbrush?\nSmart electric toothbrushes are a newer addition to the market, offering helpful insights into your brushing habits -- and even tips to improve your technique. Thankfully, they haven't gone full-AI just yet, though. A recent CNET survey found that 25% of phone owners don't find AI features useful, but that doesn't mean we can't all learn a thing or two about oral hygiene from our phones.\nTo find the best electric toothbrushes, we tested 24 models over several weeks, considering design, functionality, price, modes and ADA recommendations for cleaner teeth and healthier gums.\nThe Oral-B Pro 1000 is my top overall pick due to its competitive price, cleaning power, brush timer, oscillating head, soft bristles and affordable replacement brush heads. It is also ADA-accepted, meaning that the American Dental Association has deemed the brush safe and effective.\nI personally tested each electric toothbrush featured in this list, evaluating them against each other. Throughout each testing phase, considerations included design, functionality, cost, brush size, portability, speed settings, modes and the technology incorporated. Each toothbrush was used once in the morning and once at night for up to a week. The following are my top selections.\nBest electric toothbrush of 2025\nPros\n- Affordable brush and brush head replacements\n- Two-minute brush timer, low battery alert and pressure sensor\n- ADA seal of acceptance\nCons\n- Not as high tech as Philips Sonicare or iO Series\n- Only one brush mode\nThe Oral-B Pro 1000 electric toothbrush is a powerful and functional product with a lower price tag that really stands out. It has one daily cleaning mode and a two-minute timer that signals you to move mouth quadrants every 30 seconds.\nI tested the Oral-B Pro 1000 for a week, and it was my favorite product due to its simplicity and impressive cleaning abilities. I hardly had to scrub or brush my teeth on my own, the fast-spinning bristles did most of the work for me. It easily glided across my teeth. The smaller brush head also helped me to get to those hard-to-reach places. On top of that, the Oral-B Pro 1000 is ADA-accepted.\nPros\n- Pressure sensors and automatically adjusts\n- Bluetooth capabilities with an impressive app\n- Reminds you to replace your brush head\nCons\n- Not for people who want a rotating brush head\n- Expensive\nThe Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige is a lifesaver if you have sensitive gums like me. I sometimes brush too hard, and the Philips Sonicare buzzes and lights up when I press down too hard with the toothbrush; a gentle nudge to let me know to lighten the pressure. The brush also automatically adjusts intensity if you're pushing too hard.\nThe Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige has three different intensity modes and an app that shows your coverage. Similar to the app with the Oral-B iO Series, the display on your phone shows a 3D scan of your mouth and highlights the areas you are missing. The Sonicare app also guides you while brushing, and keeps track of your data, how much you are scrubbing (a big no-no with electric toothbrushes) and the pressure you are applying.\nAnother great feature of this brush is the reminders. If you have trouble remembering when to replace your brush heads, Philips' BrushSync technology will tell you how long you've been using your brush head. A light on the handle will blink and the Sonic toothbrush will beep, letting you know it's time to order a new one.\nPros\n- Sustainable design\n- Eco-friendly packaging\n- Recycling program\nCons\n- Pricier than other options\n- Lack of app connectivity\nThe SURI electric toothbrush redefines sustainable oral care by offering a product that prioritizes performance and environmental responsibility. The SURI toothbrush is built with a light aluminum body that can be repaired, refurbished or recycled. Its replaceable and fully recyclable brush heads help reduce waste (replacement heads come with a with a free pre-paid mailer bag made from compostable material so you can send back the used brush head to be recycled).\nThe brush also has 30-second timers to let you know when it's time to move to another section of your mouth and automatically turns off after two minutes. The battery also lasts a bit longer than other electric toothbrushes I've tested (lasts up to 40 days). It's also pretty quiet at just 54dB.\nPros\n- Quiet and great for travel\n- Good for sensitive gums\n- Two-minute brush timer\nCons\n- Only one brushing mode\n- Doesn't come with an interactive app\nI found the Philips One Rechargeable to be one of the gentlest of the brushes on this list, yet I still felt like my teeth were thoroughly cleaned with each use. I liked how small and lightweight it was.\nThe brush head is slimmer than the Philips Sonicare brush but still similar to a manual toothbrush. The bristles are soft and flexible and the handle is small and light, the perfect fit for the palm of your hand. It only has one cleaning mode and a two-minute timer that turns off the brush once you reach that mark.\nThe case it comes with is also one of the best parts of this brush. To store it, just flip the brush with its head down and pop into the case. The top flap closes and it is ready to go. I traveled with this brush on more than one occasion, and I specifically chose this brush to go with me due to its sleek design, quiet motor and the ease of slipping it into my bag.\nPros\n- Ideal brush for infant to toddler transition\n- Perfect size for toddler hands\n- Charge lasts a long time\n- Vibration isn\u2019t too loud that it scares children\nCons\n- Could use more brush heads\n- There isn\u2019t a cover to protect it from other grime in the bathroom\nI\u2019d been searching for a toothbrush for my 1.5-year-old but had no luck with the traditional brushes. He loves the Pure Enrichment PureBaby Infant-to-Toddler Electric Toothbrush. This toothbrush has improved my ability to brush my son\u2019s teeth and keep him entertained while doing so. He\u2019s also attempted to brush his own teeth because he finds the vibration and the light that shines from it to be fun. The helpful part is that this brush is designed to fit comfortably in a toddler\u2019s hand.\nThis brush comes with two brush heads, which are intended to be used as babies transition to toddlers. The silicone brush head is ideal for babies six months to a year, and it was the first attachment I tried with my son. The bristle brush head is intended for toddlers ages one to three, and the bristles are soft enough that they don\u2019t hurt my son\u2019s gums. I like how this brush has various speed options, and when he gets older and starts brushing independently, it has a two-minute timer. The PureBaby brush is also easy to recharge, but it can last awhile before it needs a charge. I\u2019ve only charged it once since I received it, and it\u2019s been over a month.\nPros\n- Small handle and brush head\n- Available in two colors and comes with fun stickers for the handle\n- Two-minute timer\nCons\n- Not the same battery life as Oral-B adult brushes\n- Brush head replacements are more expensive than adults'\nThe Oral-B Kid's Color Changing Electric Toothbrush is my pick for the best electric toothbrush for kids. The handle feels small in my adult palm, so it's a good fit for little hands. The toothbrush has one gentle mode, comes in two colors and each box is equipped with stickers to decorate the waterproof handle.\nThe soft, round brush head oscillates back and forth to clean the teeth, and the brush itself is a lot smaller than the usual Oral-B brush head. The two-minute coaching timer helps kids learn how long to brush their teeth. Also, the bristles of the brush head change from blue to white when it's time to replace the brush head.\nPros\n- 3D teeth tracking, smart pressure sensor and LED indicator lights\n- Convenient travel case\n- ADA seal of acceptance\nCons\n- On the expensive side\n- The more I used this brush, the more I had to charge it\nThis Oral-B electric toothbrush is similar to other Oral-B brushes, except the bristles on this brush felt softer than the Oral-B Pro 1000. That's a big bonus for anyone with sensitive gums, as is the real-time coaching that tells you if you're brushing too hard. The Oral-B iO also has a quieter motor compared with the Pro 1000.\nThe display offers an impressive amount of information. Based on the lit-up icon, you can easily tell what mode you're brushing in. The iO has five brush modes, whereas most electric toothbrushes seem to have three or four. You can choose from daily clean, intense clean, whitening, sensitive and super sensitive. The Oral-B iO Series is also ADA-accepted.\nPros\n- Small brush head can easily maneuver around the mouth\n- The power of Sonicare in a small, sleek brush\n- An extremely great value\nCons\n- Not as affordable as the Phillips One brush\n- Not for those who want large brush heads that cover more area\nThis Philips Sonicare brush is tiny but mighty. It is slimmer than the other Sonicare brushes on this list, and the handle is smooth and fits in the hand well. While this model doesn\u2019t come with a traveling case, a stand or an interactive smart app, it does offer one of the quietest brushing experiences on this list. The Oral-B units can be a bit loud, but this Sonicare\u2019s vibration is hushed, especially on the first cleaning mode.\nWhile it may be quiet and missing extra smart features, the brush still packs a powerful cleaning punch. It cleans just as well as the brand\u2019s high-end products. If you are interested in a traditional Philips Sonicare brush but don\u2019t want to pay a hefty price tag, I recommend this model.\nPros\n- Quiet and sleek design\n- Light-up ring at the base of the brush head indicates correct and incorrect pressure\n- Two-minute brush timer and two sensitivity settings\n- Smart hub acts as brush head cleaner with UV sanitizing, drying and wireless charging\nCons\n- Using the smart hub as a carrying case is large and requires to be plugged in to activate cleaning mode\n- A travel case with the toothbrush and smart hub is an extra $30\nSwitching from a regular electric toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush for the first time, the movement of the soft bristles was deceiving at first. But after reading up more about appropriate hand movements with this kind of brush, I have found that this unit cleans teeth thoroughly and smoothly without tearing too deep into my teeth's enamel.\nThe number of bristles and their thinness add to the smooth sensation of the action. I also like that the power button is located toward the bottom of the unit, avoiding accidental switch-offs during brushing. However, the pauses between sections in the 2-minute timer feel abrupt. I find myself turning the unit on one more time for an extra 30 seconds to brush parts that felt incomplete.\nPros\n- Most of the same technology as later iO Series at a lower cost\n- ADA seal of acceptance\n- Simple and straightforward modes and features\nCons\n- Doesn\u2019t come with a travel case\n- Not for those who want an interactive app\nThe iO Series 3 is another excellent Oral-B option at a lower price than the highly-loved iO Series 6. It has the same round brush head that seems to cover and clean each tooth individually. My teeth feel the most clean when I use a round brush. It gets down to the gum line without being too intense. I also enjoy this brush's simplicity; it only has two buttons and three modes. It is extremely effortless to use. The LED light ring around the brush alerts you when you are pushing too hard.\nIf you are looking for an app that tracks your brushing and areas you might be missing in your mouth, you will want to upgrade to the iO Series 6 or above. However, if you are looking for a simple Oral-B brush with a bit more cleaning power compared to the Pro 1000 (although the difference is slight) and something more affordable than the iO Series 6, then the Series 3 might be your middle ground.\nPros\n- Real-time coaching via app\n- Travel case included\n- Quiet, compared to other high-powered electric toothbrushes\nCons\n- High price tag at $230\n- Brush head replacements are pricey\nBrushing my teeth with this smart toothbrush has become one of my favorite parts of my morning routine. The app syncs with the toothbrush in real time and corrects my techniques if I brush too hard or skip any areas. I also appreciate the sleek, minimalistic design and the glass charger cup, which goes well with any bathroom decor. If you like tracking your wellness habits, this toothbrush is for you, as you can see and track your progress in the app.\nThe Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart 9300 is a step down in price from our pick for the best high-end electric toothbrush. If you are interested in the Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige, this might be a good alternative since both brushes come with smart sensors, many modes and Bluetooth capabilities to connect to a smart interactive app on your phone.\nPros\n- Sleek, compact and weightless design\n- Dynamic touch bar allows you to control speed\n- Minimal grim and waste with changeable brush pods\nCons\n- Replacement heads are almost three times more expensive than normal\n- Not ADA accepted\nPrior to testing, I was only familiar with Quip\u2019s Sonic toothbrush. The Quip Ultra is a huge step up in terms of look, feel, technology and overall performance. It is made almost entirely of silicone and is one of the most cohesive, smooth and compact toothbrushes on this list. It stands out with its touch bar feature that controls the speed; I counted about 13 different speed levels.\nThe Quip Ultra doesn\u2019t have replaceable brush heads but brush pods. The neck of the brush stays intact, and only the bristles pop in and out. This way, there is less gunk hiding in your brush's little crevices. I did have to watch a video on how to successfully remove the brush pod (push up until it clicks and then turn it 90 degrees to pull it out), but then I was able to test changing the head.\nThis is a very straightforward toothbrush with only one button and a touch bar. The travel case is just as sleek and small as the brush; it easily fits inside a suitcase, purse or backpack. I\u2019ve traveled with this brush, and it is very convenient when my bags are overflowing with too much stuff.\nPros\n- Very gentle bristles that don\u2019t irritate gums\n- Hardwear feels sleek, sturdy and high-quality in hand\n- Available in fun themes such as Hello Kitty and Barbie\nCons\n- Case is hard to open and prone to breaking\n- Not ADA approved\nI have an extremely sensitive mouth, and an intense electric toothbrush can easily irritate my gums. When I first inspected the brush head on the Moon Electric Toothbrush, I was a little intimidated. It is twice as big as most of the brush heads on this list, yet I was pleasantly surprised at how gentle it felt on my teeth. The bristles are very soft and flexible; I never felt like they were tearing up my gums.\nThe handle is sturdy and feels as solid as an Oral-B or Phillips Sonicare product. Moon has more brush modes than most I have tested. The five include clean, white, polish, massage and sensitive. I used the clean and sensitive modes the most, but I found the first clean setting about as gentle and sensitive.\nThe case it comes with is the biggest drawback to this product. It is very difficult to open, and I\u2019ve hurt my fingers trying to pry it. I don\u2019t recommend using the case; maybe find another carrier.\nPros\n- ADA seal of acceptance\n- Includes eight replacement heads\n- Brushes similar to a Phillips Sonicare\nCons\n- Plastic brush heads feel cheap\n- Travel case is flimsy and can break easily\nThe AquaSonic Black Series electric toothbrush is similar to popular, high-end brands. Specifically, I think it\u2019s a Phillips Sonicare dupe. Both brush heads are very similar and clean about the same; I even found that an AquaSonic head fit on a Phillips brush. While this brush is around the same price as the Phillips Sonicare 4100, you get a bit more bang for your buck. One, you get about eight replacement brush heads. That\u2019s the most I\u2019ve ever seen with any toothbrush I have ever tested. If you replace one every three to four months, that would last you almost two and a half years. The AquaSonic also has four different cleaning modes, while the Phillips only has two. Additionally, this Black Series comes with a travel case, although it\u2019s made of thin plastic.\nThere are quite a few lesser-known electric toothbrush brands on Amazon, although this has the be the best. The best part is that it has the ADA seal of acceptance -- something even a Phillips brush lacks. If you like the look and feel of a Sonicare brush and want better value out of your purchase, including spending less on replacement heads, the AquaSonic Black Series is for you.\nBest electric toothbrushes compared\n| Toothbrush | Modes | Timer | ADA-accepted | App | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Oral-B Pro 1000 | Daily cleaning | Yes | Yes | No | $50 |\n| Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige | Clean, deep clean, gum health, sensitive and white+ | Yes | No | Yes | $380 |\n| Suri Electric Toothbrush | Clean, deep clean | Yes | No | No | $95 |\n| Philips One Rechargeable by Sonicare | Cleaning mode | Yes | No | No | $40 |\n| Oral-B Kid's Color Changing Electric Toothbrush | Cleaning mode | Yes | No | No | $15 |\n| Pure Enrichment PureBaby Infant-to-Toddler Electric Toothbrush | Two gentle speeds | Yes | No | No | $27 |\n| Oral-B iO Series 5 | Daily clean, intense clean, whitening, sensitive and super sensitive | Yes | Yes | Yes | $120 |\n| Phillips Sonicare 4100 | Clean, deep clean | Yes | No | No | $50 |\n| Supermouth | Two sensitive modes | Yes | No | No | $100 |\n| Oral-B iO Series 3 | Daily clean, sensitive, whitening | Yes | Yes | No | $80 |\n| Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart 9300 | Clean, white+, gum health, deep clean+, tounge care | Yes | No | Yes | $230 |\n| Quip Ultra Next Generation | 13 levels of intensity | Yes | No | No | $116 |\n| Moon Electric Toothbrush | Clean, white, polish, massage, sensitive | Yes | No | No | $70 |\n| AquaSonic Black Series | Clean, soft, whiten, massage | Yes | Yes | No | $50 |\nOther electric toothbrushes tested\nThe electric toothbrushes in this section weren't my favorites, but they have some qualities worth mentioning. One of these might be the right choice for you, so we felt it was worthwhile to include them.\nOral-B iO2\nSince I love the Oral-B iO Series 5 so much (it\u2019s been my main toothbrush for over two years now), I was sent the new Oral-B iO2 electric toothbrush to test. It has the same brushing power and feel as the Series 5. It has three cleaning modes, a pressure sensor and a two-minute timer.\nMy main concern, however, is that you can\u2019t see the pressure light when you're brushing; you can\u2019t even see it if you're looking in the mirror. Unless you have the front of the toothbrush flipped, you can\u2019t see the green or red light on the power button telling you if you're brushing just right or too hard. I had to brush my teeth completely in the dark in order to watch the LED light change. But if this isn\u2019t a drawback for you, the price is much nicer than the Series 5.\nOclean X Ultra S\nWhen I first started testing this brush, I skipped over the instructions (which I don\u2019t recommend). I must have pressed too hard while brushing because I suddenly heard a child\u2019s voice come out of the device. To say it startled me would be an understatement. If I had read the instructions, I would have known that the Oclean X Ultra toothbrush has a pressure sensor that alerts you when you're pushing down on the device too hard. An AI child-like voice really does speak to you, but it\u2019s muffled, and you can\u2019t hear what \u201cthe brush\u201d says.\nIt also has an LED screen that shows you which quadrant of your mouth needs more attention or doesn\u2019t get as clean as other areas. However, I tested just brushing one side of my mouth and the screen told me that I cleaned that area well, as well as another section of my teeth that I didn\u2019t touch. It\u2019s easy to see why the Oral-B iO Series 5 beats the Oclean X Ultra as the best smart electric toothbrush.\nBurst Pro Sonic\nBurst Pro Sonic is a popular electric toothbrush on Amazon. It has just over 7,000 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5. However, I was very disappointed with the feel of this brush. While the bristles are very soft, it has a piece of silicone in the middle of the brush head that I assume is used to scrap plaque and stuck-on food (the website doesn\u2019t explain). This tiny piece felt too strange on my teeth.\nI think I could let this unfortunate design slide if the brush came in at a good price, but the Burst Pro Sonic retails for a little over $50. If you're already going to spend that much on an electric toothbrush, I recommend the Phillips Sonicare 4100.\nPhilips Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush\nFor ages 3 and up, the Philips Sonicare for Kids is just as great as Philips' other Sonicare models. The electric brush has two different modes and a brush timer and comes in two different colors. Plus, each box contains stickers to decorate the handle. It functions very similarly to the Oral-B Kid's Electric Toothbrush, although the brush head vibrates instead of oscillating.\nThe handle is heavier and about an inch longer than that of the Oral-B Kid's Color Changing toothbrush. The brush head is a smaller version of the Philips Sonicare Prestige but is still almost three times longer than the Oral-B Kid's brush head. What makes the Sonicare for Kids brush unique is that it has Bluetooth capabilities that connect to a smartphone app. I think the app is one of the best; it has educational videos and a tracking system that parents can use to see their kids' brushing behavior.\nQuip Electric Toothbrush\nThe Quip brush head is very close to the size of a manual toothbrush head. The Quip is simple in every aspect: It has one speed and a two-minute timer that buzzes every 30 seconds and turns off once the time is up. That's it. There's no app, charger or wires. This electric toothbrush is powered by an AAA battery located in the handle and the charge lasts three months.\nI gave the Hum by Colgate the \"best battery-powered electric toothbrush\" title and not the Quip because I didn't like the brush head of the toothbrush. Yes, it's similar to a manual toothbrush but I found it hard to use to reach around my mouth. I also noticed that Quip's motor isn't very powerful compared with models from Sonicare or Oral-B. To me, it felt just like a manual cleaning. I didn't like that, but others may not mind. If you're looking for a smart electric toothbrush without Bluetooth or an app, the Quip may be the one.\nCariPro Electric Toothbrush\nThe CariPro is a good brush, it just didn't compare to the others on this list. The brush head vibrates and the top and bottom of the brush flare outward.\nMy gums and teeth felt sensitive after using the CariPro, but I tend to experience dental sensitivity. It's hard to say if it was due to the brush bristles or the way the brush head flared out. If you have sensitive gums, note that the brush has five settings and one of which is a sensitive one. There's some good in this: I feel like the CariPro did a good job of cleaning my mouth.\nY-Brush\nThe Y-Brush turned heads and piqued interest at CES in 2017 and has come back to CES year after year. The strange, Y-shaped brush claims that it can brush all of your teeth in just 10 seconds. After applying toothpaste directly on the brush, the entire Y-Brush goes into your mouth. You then must bite down and press the button to activate the gentle vibrations. After five seconds, you can move to your lower set of teeth.\nI not only found that the Y-Brush didn't clean my teeth but that the vibrations hurt my head. It was an uncomfortable experience that simply left my teeth coated in toothpaste. But the concept of this brush is fun and interesting and it might be for you if you're tired of ordinary electric toothbrushes.\nOral-B Pro 500 Precision Clean\nMy experience with the Oral-B Pro 500 Precision Clean brush compared with some others in the same price range. It has one cleaning mode and the brush head oscillates and rotates on a two-minute timer. The brush alerts you when you're finished, too. This simple Oral-B brush is basic and doesn't have any special technology or paired apps.\nOut of all the Oral-B brushes I tested with rotating spin heads, I liked this one the least. It wasn't as powerful as the others and after a few uses, I found myself wondering if I needed a new brush head. I think this brush is perfect for someone testing out an electric toothbrush for the first time. It is simple and very reasonably priced. I would personally choose the Oral-B Pro 1000, but this Pro 500 is a good budget option.\nFeno Smartbrush\nSimilar to the Y-Brush above, the Feno Smartbrush is also a mouthpiece-like brush that uses vibrating bristles to clean your teeth. It\u2019s basically the Y-Brush with added AI features and a larger range to clean all your teeth -- top and bottom -- all at once. It\u2019s also more personalized. You upload a picture of your mouth to the Feno app and then receive personal molds designed to reach all your teeth. A corresponding app connects to the device to show you areas where you might be missing and offer dental advice.\nI have a very tight and small jaw, so this brush was uncomfortable for me to use. I also couldn\u2019t justify the price when a less expensive brush could clean my teeth better. However, a CNET contributor had a different experience. She found it \u201ca mouthful\u2026 in a good way.\u201d\nHum by Colgate\nThis brush has three modes: normal, sensitive and deep clean, and it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know when to move on to another quadrant of your mouth. The charger is small and easy to travel with, as is the carrying case, which can hold two brush heads. One of the best features this brush offers is the guided brushing feature within the app, which tells you how good (or bad) a job you're doing. It offers encouragement and reminds you that you can earn rewards for brushing better. It might sound silly, but the experience really did make me want to brush better.\nWhile it originally made our list, this brush has been discontinued. You can still buy it on Amazon, but the replacement heads are unavailable.\nElectric toothbrush vs. manual\nThe ADA also says that both electric and manual toothbrushes effectively remove plaque, but there are key differences.\nElectric toothbrush\nPros:\n- The elderly, children, or people with dexterity impairments or disabilities may find it easier to use\n- Can be better at hitting hard-to-reach spots\n- Built-in pressure sensors alert you when you're brushing too hard\nCons:\n- More expensive\n- Require batteries or charging\nManual toothbrush\nPros:\n- Relatively cost-effective\n- Very easy to find\nCons:\n- You can brush too hard, damaging your teeth's enamel\n- Easy to miss spots in your mouth\n- You can brush for less than two minutes if not paying attention\nBoth electric and manual toothbrushes help you clean your teeth, avoid gingivitis and improve gum health. Regardless of which brush you choose, don't forget to floss before brushing your teeth. \"If you are unsure about the best option for your at-home oral health routine, consider consulting your dentist for advice,\" says Dr. Yazdani.\nCare and maintenance of electric toothbrushes\nCaring for an electric toothbrush is different from caring for a manual one. Although both brushes require you to rinse off the head after each use, the head of electric toothbrushes should be detached and cleaned separately. Wipe it down and then wipe off the handle. Put the head back on the body of the brush and let it dry. Also, store your electric toothbrush standing up straight so it can dry between uses. Periodontist Scott H. Froum says, \"storage of the device in a non-wet or humid environment is important.\" A bathroom cabinet is a good place.\nDr. Silver also reminds patients, \"Periodically, the toothbrush handle should be cleaned.\" One should be careful: \"Avoid exposing or submerging the [entire] toothbrush [handle] in water, as it can damage the internal components,\" she adds. Lastly, and most importantly, replace your electric brush head every three months. Replace it earlier if the bristles are fading or fraying.\nBest electric toothbrush FAQs\nWhat is the best electric toothbrush?\nThe best electric toothbrush on this list is the Oral-B Pro 1000. It's cost-effective, ADA-accepted, has a pressure sensor and alerts you on brush time. The best electric toothbrush is ultimately whichever works best for you. Consider cost, pressure sensors, smart features, intensity levels and ADA seal of approval.\nIf you have sensitive gums, look for an electric toothbrush that has a gentle setting, like the Quip or CariPro. If you're looking for a deep clean, a spinning electric toothbrush head like that found on the Oral-B may be for you. Consult your dentist if you have questions about which type may be right.\nIs it OK to use an electric toothbrush every day?\nYes, but make sure you're using it correctly. If you brush your teeth with too much pressure, you run the risk of damaging your enamel or gums.\nHow much should I spend on an electric toothbrush?\nElectric toothbrushes can be expensive. A quality, low-cost electric toothbrush can run you anywhere from $25 to $40. If you are looking for a high-end electric toothbrush with all of the recent technology, you can expect to pay anywhere from $150 to $300.\nWhich works better: a sonic or rotating electric toothbrush?\nThe best toothbrush is the one you\u2019ll use consistently. Companies often fund studies to compare performance, but results can be skewed based on who conducts them. As long as you brush for two minutes a day and use your electric toothbrush correctly, you\u2019ll maintain good dental hygiene."

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/nano-hydroxyapatite-toothpaste-benefits-risks-fluoride-free-alternative/",
      "text": "As health concerns around fluoride in public drinking water continue to swirl, nano-hydroxyapatite toothpastes are becoming increasingly popular substitutes for fluoride toothpaste. Popular brands include Boka Davids and NOBS (No Bad Stuff), which are touted as fluoride-free alternatives that whiten teeth, repair enamel and prevent cavities.\n\"As ingredient labels shift toward cleaner, fluoride-free formulas, one compound is taking center stage in modern oral care: nano-hydroxyapatite,\" Dr. Pia Lieb, DDS, cosmetic dentist and clinical assistant professor emerita at NYU College of Dentistry, explains. If you're thinking about replacing your fluoride toothpaste with a nano-hydroxyapatite alternative, this is what dental experts want you to know before you brush your teeth.\nWhat is nano-hydroxyapatite?\n\"Nano-hydroxyapatite is a synthetic calcium phosphate compound that's used in some oral care products, including toothpastes,\" explains Dr. Ada Cooper, consumer advisor and spokesperson for the American Dental Association, says. \"[It] has a structure that is similar to hydroxyapatite found in enamel, and nHAP gets incorporated into the tooth structure preferentially in demineralized areas.\"\nNano-hydroxyapatite is also abbreviated as n-HA and n-HAp.\nDr. Royce Lai of King Village Dental adds that this is technically a two-part question, since \"hydroxyapatite has been around for decades and has been studied for at least 20 years.\" Newer and less studied, nano-hydroxyapatite is a version of hydroxyapatite with small, rod-shaped particles.\n\"Hydroxyapatite is natural. It is a type of calcium that makes up bones and teeth,\" says Lai. \"Nano-hydroxyapatite relates to the particle size. These are between 20 and 80 nanometers and are much smaller than the hydroxyapatite tubules that are a part of your teeth.\"\nAccording to Dr. Daniela Eversgerd, a cosmetic dentist and the founder of Allure Dental, nano-hydroxyapatite was developed by NASA in the 1970s for astronauts dealing with bone and enamel loss during long periods of space travel. Since the early 1990s, it has been approved for oral care products in Japan.\nNano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste benefits\n\"Nano-hydroxyapatite doesn't just protect your teeth -- it helps rebuild them,\" says Dr. Catrise Austin, a cosmetic dentist, author of Gum Health Made Simple and host of the Let's Talk Smiles podcast. She lists the following as potential nano-hydroxyapatite benefits:\n- Enamel remineralization\n- Tooth sensitivity relief\n- Reduced bacterial adhesion\n- Whitening and gloss enhancement\n\"n-HA can actually fill microscopic cracks and help reverse or arrest early cavities,\" adds dentist Dr. Sandip Sachar.\nAustin cites a 2019 study that found a 10% hydroxyapatite toothpaste is equivalent or non-inferior to fluoride toothpaste for preventing and remineralizing dental cavities (or caries) in children.\nWhen it comes to teeth sensitivity, Lai cites a 2014 study concluding that 15% nano-hydroxyapatite helped sensitive teeth. \"The particle size could get into space and work better than larger particles in micro-hydroxyapatite or fluoride,\" he explains. \"The conclusion was that nano-hydroxyapatite could significantly reduce tooth sensitivity to hot and cold in two to four weeks of use.\"\nReferencing an 18-month 2023 clinical trial finding that a 10% n-HAp toothpaste protected adult teeth from new cavities as well as a standard 1,450-ppm fluoride paste, Dr. Christopher Tolmie, DDS, MBA, of PDS Health, states, \"By patching enamel and calming swollen gums, nano-hydroxyapatite may cut off a hidden spark of chronic inflammation linked to heart disease and diabetes.\"\nSince nano-hydroxyapatite toothpastes are fluoride free, Dr. Yenile Y. Pinto, DDS, functional and biomimetic dentist and founder of Deering Dental, adds, \"It's also been shown to reduce sensitivity and strengthen the enamel surface without the risk of fluorosis.\" Fluorosis occurs when you get too much fluoride as a child, causing white or brown spots on the teeth. The CDC reports that fluorosis typically doesn't affect tooth function and isn't painful.\nA 2020 systematic review of 32 studies concluded that \"Nano-HA is a relatively novel material with outstanding physical, chemical, mechanical and biological properties that makes it suitable for multiple interventions. It outperformed most of the classic materials used in implantology and surgery, but it should be further investigated for bone engineering and caries prevention therapy.\"\nA 2023 comprehensive review found that, while more long-term studies are needed to establish the safety of regular use, \"Nanohydroxyapatite is a promising revolutionary material in the prevention of early carious lesion mainly due to a greater source of free calcium.\"\nUltimately, providing a 2021 review and 2022 scoping review, Cooper concludes, \"Although there is some evidence that alternative ingredients, such as [nano] hydroxyapatite, prevent tooth decay by acting as a remineralizing or anti-cavity agent, the studies are preliminary. The only anti-cavity agent recognized by the Food and Drug Administration in its over-the-counter monograph is fluoride, a naturally occurring chemical.\"\nCooper adds that all toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance contain fluoride. The administration specifically recommends brushing your teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and regularly visiting your dentist.\nNano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste risks\n\"According to a [2021] narrative review from Odontology, the official journal of the Society of the Nippon Dental University, so far, there have been no reports of adverse dental or systemic effects of HAP-containing toothpastes because HAP has an excellent biocompatibility,\" states Cooper.\nAccording to Austin, the concern with nano-hydroxyapatite is that, because it's made of nanoparticles, some worry about how much might get absorbed into the body if regularly swallowed. \"The European Commission's Scientific Committee raised concerns due to the lack of long-term safety data on ingestion, particularly in children,\" she says. This has led to temporary nano-hydroxyapatite restrictions (not a full-on banning) in Europe.\nThe European Scientific Committee deems nHA safe in toothpaste up to 29.5% and up to 10% in mouthwash, per Tolmie. However, he states, \"Regulators still bar it from breath-spray products to avoid lung exposure, so stick to pastes and rinses.\"\nKey concerns around nano-hydroxyapatite, according to Lieb, are:\n- Potential ingestion and systemic absorption, especially in nano form\n- Lack of long-term studies in humans on the cumulative effects\n- Unknown impact of inhalation from aerosol products (not toothpaste)\nIn terms of systemic absorption, Sachar specifies, \"Because nano-hydroxyapatite particles are similar in composition to bone mineral, there has been some theoretical concern that if absorbed systemically, they could potentially contribute to unwanted calcifications in soft tissues (like blood vessels or kidneys).\" However, she states that this is speculative and not supported by any current clinical evidence.\nIs nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste only effective at 10%?\n\"Most clinical formulations of nHA range from 5%-15%, with 10% emerging as the benchmark concentration in several Japanese and European studies,\" answers Lieb. \"This concentration has demonstrated reliable enamel restoration while maintaining product stability and usability.\"\nHowever, she states that newer formulations are experimenting with lower concentrations and enhanced delivery systems (such as encapsulation or synergistic minerals), which may improve efficacy at reduced levels. \"The effectiveness isn't just about percentage, it's also about particle quality and how it's delivered to the tooth surface,\" she explains.\nTolmie adds, \"Effective repair starts as low as 5% and plateaus around 10-15%. Several studies show that 5% n-HAp can mend enamel dings, divots and dents in the teeth, with benefits leveling off somewhere between 10% and 15%. One review even noted that 5% sometimes beats 10% because fewer particles clump, making them easier to slip into enamel defects; hence, most US brands sit comfortably in the 5-10% sweet spot.\"\nWe also reached out to Dr. Foti Panagakos, who's a part of Boka's Oral Health Advisory Committee. \"While there is a lot of discussion around nano-hydroxyapatite concentration and its effectiveness, what matters most is how it is formulated and the fact that the ingredient is backed by research,\" he explains. \"This includes how nano-hydroxyapatite is stabilized, delivered and supported by other ingredients, which is why at Boka, years were spent working with oral health professionals to ensure our formula delivers on both safety and performance. Each tube of Boka toothpaste contains a precisely balanced concentration of nano-hydroxyapatite -- high enough to deliver measurable benefits and safe for daily use, with a formula that's gentle on dentin.\"\nShould people replace fluoride toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite?\nEversgerd states that it all depends on each person's oral health needs. \"Fluoride remains the gold standard for cavity prevention, supported by decades of large-scale, randomized controlled trials,\" she explains. \"However, for patients seeking a fluoride alternative -- whether due to sensitivity, allergies, personal preferences or a desire for a biomimetic approach -- nano-hydroxyapatite provides a scientifically supported option.\"\nAccording to the Academy of Biomimetic Dentistry, a biomimetic approach is one in which damaged teeth are restored using materials mimicking natural teeth in function, strength and appearance.\nFor high-risk patients, Eversgerd recommends fluoride, while she may recommend n-Ha to low-risk or fluoride-averse individuals.\nAustin seconds this, but adds that she also recommends fluoride toothpaste to children with poor brushing habits or communities with limited dental access. \"nHA is a great option, but it's not a one-size-fits-all replacement for fluoride -- yet,\" Austin says.\nLieb explains that nHA may also be a compelling alternative for patients with aesthetic concerns, such as whitening-induced sensitivity, and individuals in preventive care regimens post-restorative treatment.\nPinto agrees that it depends on the person, stating, \"For most of my patients, especially those with low to moderate cavity risk, nano-hydroxyapatite is an excellent option; gentler on the mouth, less drying and effective at rebuilding early damage. For people with high cavity risk, fluoride might still be the best choice, at least short term. For my high-risk patients, I often recommend a combo toothpaste that includes both ingredients when appropriate.\" Ultimately, if a patient isn't high risk and has health or safety concerns about fluoride, she thinks hydroxyapatite is a great option.\nWhen asked if there's a reason people should choose n-HAp over other anti-cavity toothpastes, Tolmie answers, \"No, as long as patients are brushing their teeth with an anti-cavity toothpaste. There are differences in the way an n-HAp toothpaste and a fluoride toothpaste work to prevent decay, and some n-HAp toothpastes may feel smoother on the teeth. But anti-cavity toothpastes as a whole accomplish the same task. Do I wash a car with tap water or bottled water? We know that both of them get the job done.\"\nWhat's most important, according to Tolmie, is that patients ensure they're not swallowing toothpaste.\nWhat does the American Dental Association think? Cooper states that the ADA recommends brushing teeth twice daily for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste, as the naturally occurring mineral has been proven to remineralize weakened enamel and reverse early signs of tooth decay.\n\"Additionally, the fluoride you take in from drinking water and other beverages continues to provide a topical benefit because it becomes part of your saliva, constantly bathing the teeth and helping to rebuild weakened tooth enamel,\" Cooper further explains. \"The best scientific evidence has shown that adding fluoride to community water supplies is safe and effective. This is backed by decades of research and recognized by more than 100 health organizations.\"\nDoes nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste work?\nAll of the dentists we consulted agree that nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste works, but in the right context and with the right product. It's also not a miracle cure and should not replace your entire oral care routine, dentist's recommendations or regular appointments. Plus, Eversgerd adds that more long-term, large-scale trials are needed to fully validate whether it's equal to fluoride in preventing cavities.\nWhen asked if it's effective, Austin says, \"Yes -- particularly for enamel remineralization and sensitivity. In my practice, I've seen patients who switched to nHA toothpaste experience noticeable improvements in comfort, plaque control and surface smoothness. But like any product, it works best when paired with consistent brushing, flossing and professional cleanings.\"\nPinto agrees and has also seen the results firsthand. \"It helps remineralize enamel, soothe sensitivity and support a healthier oral microbiome, especially when paired with a good routine (good home hygiene, healthy diet, hydration and nasal breathing),\" she explains, noting that it's not a miracle cure, but does offer many benefits.\nOn behalf of the ADA, Cooper echoes Eversgerd's earlier statement: \"The use of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP) in over-the-counter products is growing, and some evidence shows that nHAP may contribute to remineralization, but the evidence is fairly new and often ambiguous, especially regarding clinical indications. \"\nDo experts recommend nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste?\nAll of the experts we consulted do recommend nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste, but only for certain patients. After all, according to Austin, \"Nearly half of US adults over 30 have some form of gum disease, and you can't out-toothpaste a bad hygiene routine.\" Brushing your teeth regularly, flossing and regularly visiting your dentist are still essential, no matter what toothpaste you use.\nThough Lieb recommends nHA toothpaste for adult patients experiencing post-whitening sensitivity or early enamel erosion, low-caries risk individuals seeking natural alternatives and adults undergoing cosmetic dental work who want to protect their investment with gentle, remineralizing care, she doesn't recommend nano-hydroxyapatite for children with deciduous dentition.\n\"In my professional opinion, fluoride remains the safest and most effective option for all patients under 14,\" says Lieb. \"Its protective effect during the development of permanent dentition is unmatched, and its caries-prevention record is well established.\"\nSachar states that she often recommends it for \"patients seeking fluoride-free options, those with mild tooth sensitivity and for children at risk of swallowing fluoride toothpaste.\" However, she advises that patients with moderate to high cavity risk not fully abandon fluoride.\nAgain, it's important to note that the \"ADA recommends that adults brush their teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes each time, or as directed by a licensed dentist,\" according to Cooper. This is because the proposed benefits of nHAP are fairly new and ambiguous.\nThe bottom line\nThough more research is needed, the dentists we consulted explained that nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste can be an effective alternative to fluoride -- but only in the right context. The ADA doesn't recommend it. It's also not a miracle cure or a replacement for brushing regularly, flossing and professional dental appointments.\nIf you're considering nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste, consult your dentist first before making the switch. They know your teeth best and will be able to help you find the best toothpaste for your smile."

In fact, it\u2019s the hardest substance in your body \u2014 even harder than your bones.\nEven though enamel is strong, it can break down over time.

These minerals, which make up 95% of your enamel, bond together to form ultra-strong crystallites (small crystals).\nThe rest of your enamel consists of water (4%) and proteins (1%).\nEnamel is semi-translucent. Dentin (the layer underneath) can vary in color, from grayish-white to light yellow and everything in between. Together, enamel and dentin give your teeth their unique shade.\nSeveral factors can contribute to tooth enamel loss, including:\nAdvertisement\nTooth enamel erosion exposes the inner layers of your teeth to open air and the foods and drinks you consume. This makes your teeth more vulnerable to cavities. In addition, tooth enamel loss can make your teeth more sensitive to heat, cold and sweets.

But your dentist can place a dental crown over your tooth to protect it from further damage.\nWhile you can\u2019t regrow enamel that\u2019s gone, dentists can restore damaged tooth enamel with fluoride treatments. Fluoride remineralizes and strengthens the outer layers of your teeth.\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in many foods and water.

      "text": "Abstract\nThe aim of this trial was to determine whether a toothpaste with microcrystalline hydroxyapatite is not inferior to a fluoride toothpaste in prevention of caries in children. This double-blinded randomized control trial compared two toothpastes regarding the occurrence of caries lesions using International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) \u2265 code 1 on the primary dentition within 336 days. The test group used a fluoride-free hydroxyapatite toothpaste three times daily while control group used a toothpaste with fluoride. 207 children were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 177 of them finished the study per protocol. An increase in caries ICDAS \u2265 code 1 per tooth was observed in 72.7% of the hydroxyapatite-group (n = 88), compared with 74.2% of the fluoride-group (n = 89). The exact one-sided upper 95% confidence limit for the difference in proportion of participants with ICDAS increase \u2265 1 (-1.4%) was 9.8%, which is below the non-inferiority margin of 20% demonstrating non-inferiority of hydroxyapatite compared to the fluoride control toothpaste. This RCT showed for the first time, that in children, the impact of the daily use of a toothpaste with microcrystalline hydroxyapatite on enamel caries progression in the primary dentition is not inferior to a fluoride control toothpaste (Clinical Trials NCT03553966).\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nEarly childhood caries (ECC) is still one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide1,2,3. Children of any socioeconomic status can be affected by ECC4,5. Although a general trend in caries decline has been observed6,7, current data show that caries is still a highly prevalent disease8,9,10,11. In Poland, for example, 76.9% of 5-year-old children and 89.4% of 7-year-old children are still affected by caries8. Even in Germany with a well-established health care system and a long-term record of declining caries prevalence figures still 13.7% of 3-year-old, 43.6% of 6\u20137-year-old, and also 21.2% of 12-year-old children have at least one tooth with a caries experience9. Other developed countries like Australia and the USA show a comparable high prevalence of ECC10,11.\nThe prevention of dental caries in children and adults follows a multifactorial approach12. Besides promoting a healthy, low-sugar diet13, a thorough preventive oral health care, i.e. toothbrushing with toothpaste, at home is advised to reduce the caries-risk14.\nToothpastes should promote remineralization and inhibit demineralization of enamel and dentin to prevent dental caries14,15. Thus, fluoride provided as amine fluoride (e.g. Olaflur; C27H60F2N2O3), sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2PO3F), or stannous fluoride (SnF2) are well-known for their caries preventing effect and consequently they are frequently used in many toothpaste formulations6,14,16,17,18. However, it is known that infants and toddlers swallow a substantial proportion of the applied toothpaste during toothbrushing19,20,21,22,23,24, which can increase the systemic uptake of fluorides beyond a threshold associated with the occurrence of dental fluorosis and other unwanted side effects19,25. Therefore, in many countries toothpastes for children contain a reduced amount of fluorides compared to toothpastes for adults17.\nBesides fluorides, another approach for caries prevention is to focus on biomimetic and bio-inspired agents promoting remineralization and inhibiting demineralization of the dental hard tissue. One of these biomimetic agents is particulate hydroxyapatite (HAP; a calcium phosphate mineral; Ca5(PO4)3(OH))26,27,28,29,30,31,32. HAP has been studied in different fields of preventive oral health care14,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47. Unlike fluoride, the accidental swallowing of HAP as a toothpaste ingredient is not associated with any relevant systemic health risks such as fluorosis, as hydroxyapatite is the main inorganic component of all human hard tissues, like teeth and bones48.\nIn Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries worldwide, HAP toothpastes are commercially available for many years14,36,49. The anti-caries efficacy of HAP-toothpastes could be shown e.g. in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in Japanese school children38. Based on this study, HAP was approved as anti-caries agent in Japan in 199314.\nThe caries-preventing efficacy of a HAP-toothpaste compared to fluorides has been evaluated in a randomized controlled 6-month trial31 using The International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS)31,50,51. This study showed that in orthodontic patients the daily use of a HAP-toothpaste was not inferior to a fluoride toothpaste with 1400 ppm fluoride (amine fluoride and stannous fluoride) with respect to caries progression31. Due to the antibacterial fluoride counter ion (i.e. the ammonium salt), amine fluoride shows, in contrast to sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate, additional antibacterial/antibiofilm properties52,53,54. Additionally, a recent in situ study showed an effective remineralization of early caries lesions by a HAP toothpaste. Here, the remineralization effect was comparable to a toothpaste with 500 ppm fluoride (provided as amine fluoride). While the fluoride toothpaste showed a remineralization of mainly the surface-layer, the HAP toothpaste remineralized also the deeper enamel layers as revealed by transverse microradiography images32. While the optimal fluoride concentration of toothpastes for children is still subject to discussions (i.e. caries preventing efficacy vs. fluorosis-risk), the caries-inhibiting efficacy of children\u2019s toothpastes containing 500 ppm fluoride has been demonstrated by several clinical studies16,17,55,56.\nThe objective of this clinical trial was to compare, for the very first time, the impact of the daily use of a HAP-containing children\u2019s toothpaste on the development of enamel caries in the primary dentition with use of a fluoride control toothpaste with proven caries preventive efficacy. Enamel caries development was monitored according to the criteria of the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II)50,51. The hypothesis of this study was that the impact of the evaluated fluoride-free biomimetic HAP-containing children's toothpaste on enamel caries development in the primary dentition is not inferior to the impact of a fluoride control toothpaste.\nSubjects and methods\nStudy design and test centers\nThis multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group 336 days study was performed in children with an initial age of 3\u20137 years at the University Hospitals of Poznan and Bialystok, in Poland. The trial was approved by the ethics committees of the University Hospitals of Poznan and Bialystok and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03553966). Planning and conduct of the study were in accordance to the declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good clinical practice (GCP). During the study, an external study monitor (Dr. Egmont Zieseniss, Inpharm-Consulting, Dortmund, Germany) regularly reviewed the case report forms to verify completeness, plausibility, data consistency, protocol adherence, and the progress of enrolment. He also ensured that study supplies were being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.\nPrimary and secondary endpoints\nPrimary endpoint\nPrimary endpoint was the proportion of study subjects experiencing the development of at least one new enamel caries lesion \u2265 ICDAS code 1 or the progression of an existing enamel caries lesion by at least one ICDAS score on any of the evaluated primary molars during the observation period of 336 days. The inspected areas were all enamel surfaces of the primary molars (i.e. buccal, distal, lingual, mesial, occlusal). In this study, ICDAS II was applied based on criteria described by Ismail et al.50.\nAn enamel caries lesion with ICDAS code \u2265 1 or the progression of an existing enamel caries lesion by at least one ICDAS code in a given study participant was documented, when at least one of the assessed primary molars fulfilled one of the following conditions:\n-\n1.\nICDAS code 0 on all surfaces at baseline [visit 2] AND ICDAS code \u2265 1 on at least one surface at follow-up [visit 3 to visit 6].\n-\n2.\nICDAS code 1 (on at least one surface) at baseline [visit 2] AND ICDAS code \u2265 2 on at least one (not necessarily the same) surface at follow-up [visit 3 through visit 6].\n-\n3.\nICDAS code 2 (on at least one surface) at baseline [visit 2] AND ICDAS code \u2265 3 on at least one (not necessarily the same) surface at follow-up [visit 3 to visit 6].\n-\n4.\nNo filling (restoration) at baseline [visit 2] AND presence of a restoration (i.e. treatment of a caries lesion of ICDAS code \u2265 3) at the follow-ups [visit 3 to visit 6]\nSecondary endpoints\nSecondary endpoints were:\n-\n1.\nThe percentage of study subjects experiencing the development of at least one new enamel caries lesions \u2265 ICDAS code 2 on any of the evaluated primary molars (i.e. buccal, distal, lingual, mesial, occlusal surfaces) during the observation period (336 days),\n-\n2.\nThe changes in the coverage of the assessed primary molars with bacterial plaque according to the criteria of the Plaque Control Record57, and\n-\n3.\nThe changes in the status of gingival health of the assessed primary molars according to the criteria of the Modified Gingival Index58.\nInclusion criteria and exclusion criteria\nThe following exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied:\nInclusion criteria\n-\nAge 3\u20137 years\n-\nComplete set of fully erupted primary molars (teeth 55, 54, 64, 65, 75, 74, 84, 85)\n-\nPresence of a restoration (filling) due to caries on at least 1 primary molar\n-\nMinimum of 4 primary molars without a restoration or sealed fissure/pit\nExclusion criteria\n-\nUntreated caries lesions of ICDAS code 3\u20136\n-\nKnown hypersensitivity to one of the ingredients of the toothpastes to be tested\n-\nSystemic disorders interfering with salivary function or flow\n-\nRegular medication intake interfering with salivary function or flow\n-\nNeed for antibiotic prophylaxis during dental treatments\n-\nParticipation in any other clinical study within the past 3 months or ongoing\n-\nLack of intellectual or physical ability to follow the instructions of the study protocol\n-\nAny other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, excludes the subject from eligibility for study participation\nTreatment\nBoth test toothpaste (HAP) and control toothpaste (fluoride) were handed out to the parents of the study participants by study nurses, not being involved in the clinical assessment of the study parameters, using a computer-generated randomization list. Randomization was performed separately for each study center and was stratified for the number of restored primary molars at baseline.\n-\nStratum A: Baseline number of primary molars with restorations \u2265 1 \u2264 2.\n-\nStratum B: Baseline number of primary molars with restorations \u2265 3 \u2264 4.\nToothpastes and toothbrushes\nTo ensure blinding, both study toothpastes (HAP test, fluoride control) were provided in neutral plastic tubes of identical shape and color but differentiated with code numbers known to only the manufacturer. Both toothpastes were manufactured by a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certified external laboratory.\nThe test toothpaste with 10% microcrystalline HAP34 was identical in composition to a commercially available product (Kinder Karex Zahnpasta, Dr. Kurt Wolff GmbH & Co. KG, Bielefeld, Germany) and contained the following ingredients:\nAqua, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Hydrated Silica, Hydroxyapatite, Xylitol, Silica, Cellulose Gum, Aroma, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Sulfate, Limonene (pH in 1:10 aqueous solution was 7.7).\nThe fluoride control toothpaste with amine fluoride (500 ppm F-) was also a commercially available product (elmex Kinder-Zahnpasta CP GABA GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and contained the following ingredients in addition to amine fluoride: Aqua, Sorbitol, Hydrated Silica, Hydroxyethylcellulose, CI 77,891, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Olaflur, Aroma, Saccharin, Limonene (pH in 1:10 aqueous solution was 4.8).\nToothbrushes\nNext to the assigned toothpastes the study participants were also provided with a standardized electric toothbrush (Braun Oral-B Stage Power, P&G, Schwalbach, Germany).\nInstructions were given to parents of the participants to brush the teeth of their children with the assigned toothpaste and the provided toothbrush for 3 min in the morning and in the evening over the observation period of 336 days.\nAdditionally, all study participants brushed their teeth themselves at noon for 3 min with the assigned experimental toothpaste using a manual children's toothbrush (elmex Kinder-Zahnb\u00fcrste, CP GABA GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and applying a horizontal scrub technique under the supervision of an adult. In total, brushing with the study toothpastes was performed 3 \u00d7 daily. A brushing diary was used to monitor toothbrushing frequency.\nNote that besides the study toothpastes, no other fluoride- and/or antiseptics-containing dental care products (mouthwashes, gels etc.) were used during this study. Furthermore, no professional tooth cleaning was performed.\nCourse of the study\nDuring the course of the study 6 visits were scheduled at the clinics in Poznan and Bialystok, Poland.\nVisit 1 (screening): 0\u201363 days before study start\nIndividuals potentially eligible for study participation and their parents were informed by the investigators about the aims, significance, and risks of study participation by a written patient information form and face to face interviews. Before study inclusion, the willingness of the child and the parents to properly follow the study protocol for the next 336 days was assessed. A child was included as study participant only after the parents had given their written informed consent. After informed consent was obtained, an initial examination took place to screen the potential subject for study eligibility (inclusion and exclusion criteria) and to document the subject\u2019s demographic data.\nVisit 2 (baseline): study day 0, enrollment in the study, collection of baseline data\nIn case Visit 1 dated back more than 7 days, investigators reconfirmed that inclusion and exclusion criteria did not change and patients were still eligible for inclusion in the study.\nAssessment of the 3 study parameters was done on all surfaces of the 8 molars in this following sequence:\n-\n1.\nModified Gingival Index (GI): Gingivitis was assessed visually without touching the gingiva on the buccal and lingual marginal gingivae and interdental papillae of the included 8 primary molars. The gingiva was segmented into 6 sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal and mesio-lingual, lingual, disto-lingual), and gingival inflammation was recorded at each tooth site on a scale of 0 to 4 as described Lobene et al.58:\n-\n0\u2014Normal (absence of inflammation)\n-\n1\u2014Mild inflammation (slight change in color, little change in texture) of any portion of the gingival unit\n-\n2\u2014Mild inflammation of the entire gingival unit\n-\n3\u2014Moderate inflammation (moderate glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy) of the gingival unit\n-\n4\u2014Severe inflammation (marked redness and edema/hypertrophy, spontaneous bleeding, or ulceration) of the gingival unit\n-\n-\n2.\nPlaque Control Record (PCR): Then PCR scores were assessed by touching the tooth surfaces with a blunt periodontal probe to evaluate the coverage of the assessed primary molars with bacterial plaque57.\n-\n3.\nAfterwards, thorough teeth cleaning was performed by an experienced dentist in order to remove all dental plaque from the tooth surfaces. Professional teeth cleaning was not performed, as primary teeth and gingiva of those young children are very sensitive. Tooth brushing with a dentist was performed to ensure that all children started at the same baseline with respect to the coverage of the assessed primary molars with bacterial plaque.\n-\n4.\nCaries status (ICDAS): Caries assessment by ICDAS required the removal of adherent plaque by a toothbrush (see above).\nThe teeth were first examined wet, then the surfaces were dried for 5 s with a dental air\u2013water syringe, and again examined dry. All levels of caries lesions ranging from initial (non-cavitated) to cavitated lesions were visually identify on all surfaces (i.e. buccal, distal, lingual, mesial, occlusal surfaces) of each included primary molars, using the ICDAS II criteria (Scores 0\u20136) as described by Ismail et al.50:\n-\nScore 0: sound tooth surface;\n-\nScore 1: first visual change (opacity or discoloration) in enamel hardly visible on the wet surface but distinctly visible after air drying;\n-\nScore 2: distinct visual change (opacity or discoloration) in enamel, visible without air drying;\n-\nScore 3: localized enamel breakdown without visible dentin;\n-\nScore 4: underlying dark shadow from dentin without cavitation;\n-\nScore 5: distinct cavity with visible dentin;\n-\nScore 6: extensive distinct cavity with visible dentin.\n-\n-\n5.\nAfter assessment of GI, PCR, and ICDAS score by the examiner, the study subjects received an electric toothbrush (for brushing in the morning and in the evening), a manual toothbrush (for brushing at noon), and the allocated toothpaste (test or control) from a trained study nurse not involved in the preceding recording of GI, PCR and ICDAS. Proper use of the assigned electric toothbrush, the manual toothbrush, and the issued toothpaste were also instructed by this study nurse or a dentist not involved in the clinical examinations. To confirm the subjects\u2019 understanding of the brushing instructions, they were requested to perform their first brushing episode there in the clinic under the supervision of the study nurse. Finally, subjects/parents received a brushing diary and new appointment date for the first follow-up visit (visit 3) at 84 days (\u00b1 14 days).\nVisit 3: study day 84 (\u00b1 14 days), 1st follow-up examination; visit 4: Study day 168 (\u00b1 14 days), 2nd follow-up examination, and visit 5: study day 252 (\u00b1 14 days), 3rd follow-up examination.\nAt each follow-up visit, the GI, PCR and ICDAS were reassessed as described for the baseline visit. Subsequently, a study nurse not involved in the assessment of these study parameters (GI, PCR, ICDAS) collected back the used toothpaste tubes and toothbrushes given at the baseline visit, and supplied the subjects with new manual toothbrush, a new brushing head for the electric toothbrush, and a new supply of the assigned experimental toothpaste (test or control) for the next 84 days. Furthermore, for all visits, the study nurse checked the efficacy of the oral hygiene efforts (e.g. plaque removal) of the subjects by supervising another brushing episode there in the clinic, and if necessary, re-trained the subjects on effective brushing technique. Finally, subjects/parents received a new brushing diary and a new appointment for the subsequent visit.\nVisit 6: study day 336 (\u00b1 14 days), final visit\n336 days after baseline visit, the GI, PCR, and ICDAS assessments were repeated as described for the baseline visit. Subsequently a study nurse not involved in the assessment of the study parameters (GI, PCR, ICDAS) collected back the used toothpaste tubes and toothbrushes given at the baseline visit. Subjects\u2019 parents were informed that subjects may now resume using their usual toothpaste.\nSample size calculation\nIt was assumed that the primary endpoint (development of at least one new enamel caries lesion \u2265 ICDAS code 1 or progression of an existing enamel caries lesion by at least ICDAS code \u2265 1) would occur in about 70% of the study subjects during the observation period (48 weeks)59. The non-inferiority margin \u0394 was set to 20%31. A sample size of 2 \u00d7 75 study subjects was calculated to be sufficient to reject the null hypothesis that the test toothpaste is inferior to the control toothpaste, using a non-inferiority margin of \u0394 = 20% for the primary endpoint and one-sided, exact Fisher\u2019s Test (\u03b1 = 5%, power = 90%). Assuming a drop-out rate of 25% of the study population, a total of 200 study subjects had to be included in the study to reach at least 150 study subjects for the analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary outcome measure was analyzed primarily for the per protocol (PP) population and repeated for sensitivity reasons for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. For the primary endpoint, non-inferiority was claimed if the exact one-sided upper 95% confidence limit (CI) for the corresponding difference between test and control toothpaste was less than the pre-set inferiority margin \u0394 (difference) of \u2264 20% [\u2264 0.20]60. In addition, logistic regression analyses were performed with the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoint of development of a new enamel caries lesion with ICDAS code \u2265 2 as dependent variable and toothpaste, center, stratum (1\u20132 filled molars vs. 3\u20134 filled molars), and age as independent variables (covariates). Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) and non-parametric tests (two-sided Mann\u2013Whitney test for between-group comparisons and Friedman tests for within-group comparisons) were performed for the secondary endpoints PCR and GI. IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA) and SAS 9.4 software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) were used for the statistical evaluations. Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 were produced using the open software R (ggplot2)61.\nNote that the planned duration of the study was 336 day (48 weeks). But, in case that \u2265 70% of study participants would have experienced the primary study outcome (i.e. development of an enamel caries lesion \u2265 ICDAS code 1 on one or more of the evaluated primary molars) already at Visit 4 (study day 168 [\u00b1 7 days], 2nd follow-up examination), the study would have been finished prematurely. The blinded interim analysis revealed that < 70% of study participants experienced the primary study outcome. Thus, the study was not prematurely finished.\nBlinding and randomization\nThe study was designed as a double-blind trial. Using block randomization (provided by T.W.M.) with a block size of 4, a random list was generated to code the test and control toothpaste tubes with consecutive unique identification numbers. The randomization of toothpaste assignment was stratified by the study center and stratum (number of filled (restored) molars). Distribution of the experimental toothpastes to the study patients followed the sequence of the identification numbers and was performed by trained study nurses not involved in the examination of the study participants.\nInter-examiner reliability (ICDAS)\nAll examiners (Poznan: 4 dentists, Bialystok: 5 dentists) involved in the practical assessment of ICDAS were trained before the onset of the trial by using the ICDAS e-learning course at the ICDAS website (www.iccms-web.com) as well as by intensive practical training of ICDAS assessment under the guidance of an experienced cariologist. Scoring skills of the investigators were trained at the start of study and retrained twice more during the course of the study using an additional internet-based ICDAS training tool (specially developed for this study; assessment of 26 clinical photographs of teeth with different ICDAS-scores; random sequence). Based on the results of this online tool, the linear weighted kappa coefficient was calculated as measure of the inter-rater reliability of ordinal scaled categories (ICDAS codes) between two raters. The inter-examiner reliability was calculated using the open source statistical software R with the package IRR (kappa2; option: weight = \u201cequal \u201c). In addition, the squared weighted kappa coefficients were calculated (kappa2; option: weight = \"squared\").\nResults\nSubjects\nThe demographic data of the per protocol (PP) population are shown in Table 1.\nA total of 214 children were included in the study: 107 (50%) of them were assigned to the HAP toothpaste group and 107 (50%) to the fluoride toothpaste group. 202 (94.4%) subjects completed visit V6: HAP: n = 101 (50%), fluoride: n = 101 (50%). The study was prematurely terminated in 12 subjects (HAP: n = 6, fluoride: n = 6) for various reasons (Table 8). Due to major violations of the window for protocol-defined visits (> \u00b1 4 weeks), 17 subjects (HAP: n = 9, fluoride: n = 8) were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. Furthermore, 8 subjects (HAP: n = 4, fluoride: n = 4) were excluded due to non-compliance from the per-protocol analysis. Non-compliance was defined based on subject diaries if application of toothpaste was \u2264 1 \u00d7 daily in > 10% of study days (except last month of the study). Thus, 37 (17.3%) subjects were excluded from PP-population: HAP: n = 19, fluoride: n = 18. In total, 177 (82.7%) subjects were included in the PP set: HAP: n = 88 (82.2%), fluoride: n = 89 (83.2%).\nAll subjects who applied the test or control toothpaste at least once were included in the intention-to-treat analysis set (ITT). Missing values were replaced by last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) provided that any follow-up visits (V3-V6) were performed. In 7 subjects the study was terminated already at visit V2 (Baseline), i.e. these subjects were not included in the ITT-analyses (HAP: n = 4, fluoride: n = 3). In total, 207 subjects were included in the ITT set: HAP: n = 103, fluoride: n = 104. The primary endpoint was analyzed for the PP set and, in addition, repeated for sensitivity reasons for the ITT set.\nPatient flow chart\nThe \u201cPatient Flow Chart\u201d according to the CONSORT Statement is shown in Fig. 1.\nPrimary endpoint\nTable 2 summarizes the percentage of subjects who developed enamel caries lesions with ICDAS code \u2265 1 or a progression of an existing enamel caries lesion by at least one ICDAS code.\nThe exact one-sided upper 95% CI limit for the difference in proportion of subjects with ICDAS increase \u2265 1, per tooth as well as per surface was 9.5% which is clearly below the non-inferiority margin 20% (PP analysis) (Fig. 2). Thus, the test toothpaste (HAP) can be considered non-inferior to the control toothpaste (fluoride). This is also true for the exact two-sided upper 95% limit (11.6%). Superiority cannot be assumed as the confidence intervals are not below zero. The results of the ITT-analysis/Table 3) confirmed the results of the PP-analysis (Table 2).\nIn addition, a logistic regression analysis was performed with the primary endpoint as dependent variable and toothpaste, center, number of filled molars, and age as independent variables (covariates). The results for the PP population confirmed that the \u201crisk\u201d of development of new enamel caries lesion on ICDAS \u2265 code 1 was not significantly dependent on \u201ctoothpaste\u201d (HAP vs. fluoride).\nSecondary endpoints\nDevelopment of at least one new enamel caries lesions with ICDAS code \u2265 2\nThe proportion of subjects with development of at least one new enamel caries lesion with ICDAS \u2265 code 2 up to visit 6 (56.5%) was lower than the proportion of subjects with development of enamel caries lesions with ICDAS \u2265 code 1 or the progression of an existing enamel caries lesion by at least increase in ICDAS \u2265 code 1 (74.9%) (Tables 3 and 4).\nThe exact one-sided upper 95% confidence limits for the difference in proportion of subjects with ICDAS increase \u2265 2 up to visit (8.4%) were below the non-inferiority margin 20% [see primary endpoint] (PP analysis). This indicates that the test toothpaste (HAP) is non-inferior to the control toothpaste (fluoride) concerning this secondary endpoint (Fig. 3). This is also true for the exact two-sided upper 95% confidence limits. Superiority cannot be assumed as the confidence intervals are not below zero.\nPlaque control record (PCR)\nThe distributions of the Plaque Control Record (PCR) differentiated by toothpaste at visit 2 (baseline) to visit 6 (end of study of study, after 336 days) are shown in Table 5. The results indicate that the PCR scores only slightly differed between treatment groups (HAP vs. fluoride) but decreased in both treatment groups from (V2) to the end of study (V6) (Fig. 4).\nThe results of ANCOVA indicate the change/reduction of PCR (V6-V2) was not significantly different for both toothpastes (p = 0.152).\nAn additional ANCOVA that includes the interaction term \u201ctreatment x center\u201d showed that effects of both toothpastes were not different in the centers Poznan and Bialystok. Moreover, a non-parametric test (Friedman Test) was performed to analyze whether PCR (coverage of the assessed primary molars with bacterial plaque according to the criteria) decreased during the whole observation period (visit V2 to visit 6). The Friedman test revealed that in each treatment group (HAP and fluoride) the decrease in PCR during the observation period (visit 2 to visit 6) was significant (p < 0.001).\nModified gingival index (GI)\nThe modified Gingival Index (GI) was calculated as the mean of the modified GI scores of the eight included primary molars (teeth 54\u201385). Table 6 shows the descriptive statistics of modified GI score at visit V2 (baseline) to V6 (end of study) for both treatment groups/toothpastes. The results of ANCOVA indicate the change/reduction of modified GI (V6-V2) was not significantly different for both toothpastes (p = 0.853).\nIn almost all cases, the categories \u201cabsence of inflammation\u201d (= 0) or \u201cchange in color of any portion but not the entire marginal or papillary unit\u201d (= 1) were reported. In two cases, \u201cchange in color which involves the entire marginal or papillary unit\u201d was reported and in no case \u201cdistinctly red\u201d. The results on the GI are shown in Fig. 5.\nInter-examiner reliability (ICDAS)\nTo test the inter-examiner reliability, linear and squared weighted Kappa coefficients were calculated (Table 7).\nSafety\nNo serious and no severe adverse events (AEs) were reported in course of the study. In total, 79 AEs were reported in 48 subjects:\n-\n48 AEs in 28 subjects who applied HAP (test toothpaste) and\n-\n31 AEs in 23 subjects who applied fluoride (control toothpaste).\nTable 8 summarizes severity, causality, and outcome of AEs. There were no statistically significant differences between the toothpastes (p > 0.05, two-sided exact Fisher Test).\nDiscussion\nThe persistent prevalence of ECC at a high level around the globe, despite the proven effectiveness of fluoride, justifies the need for other caries preventive materials that can be used by children of all ages at any concentration. The effectiveness of HAP to prevent caries development and promote caries remineralization has been demonstrated in several clinical studies31,32,38,42 This clinical trial was conducted to explore future proper clinical application of hydroxyapatite toothpastes. Thus, the present study investigated the non-inferiority of HAP toothpaste to fluoride toothpaste in children. As children swallow, intended or unintended, most of their toothpastes while brushing, this leads to an increased risk of developing (dental) fluorosis or other side effects. Therefore, an active ingredient is needed that is safe if swallowed and as effective as fluorides in caries prevention.\nThis is the second clinical trial on enamel caries development showing the non-inferiority of a fluoride-free HAP toothpaste compared to fluoride toothpastes with clinically proven caries-preventing effect14,16,17. Schlagenhauf et al. observed in a 6-month study in orthodontic patients an increase in enamel caries ICDAS code \u2265 1 in 56.8% (ITT) and 54.7% (PP) of the HAP group subjects compared with 60.9% (ITT) and 61.6% (PP) of the fluoride control group (with 1400 ppm fluoride)31. The non-inferiority of HAP compared to fluoride as confirmed in our study (both for the primary and secondary endpoints regarding ICDAS; Tables 2, 3 and 4) goes in line with the results of a recently published in situ study by Amaechi et al. that analyzed the remineralization efficacy of a fluoride-fee HAP toothpaste on initial caries lesions in human primary teeth32. Moreover, a placebo-controlled trial published in 1989 demonstrated a caries preventing effect of a hydroxyapatite containing toothpaste in Japanese school children14,38. The non-inferiority of the HAP toothpaste compared to a fluoride toothpaste with antibacterial counter-ions on PCR and GI as shown in Tables 5 and 6 was already reported in other clinical trials35,36.\nOur results show that the development of new enamel caries lesion of ICDAS \u2265 code 1 severity was observed in 73.4% of the subjects (Tables 2 and 3). This number seems very high but can be explained by the high prevalence of ECC in Poland and also by the fact that we used ICDAS to assess the caries status, i.e. non-cavitated caries lesions were included in the assessment. If perhaps we had used dmft index this number would be much lower. However, ICDAS was used in order to capture any developed lesion as early as possible. On the other hand, as expected, the proportion of subjects with development of at least one new enamel caries lesion with ICDAS \u2265 code 2 up to visit 6 was lower (56.5%) than proportion of subjects with development of enamel caries lesions with ICDAS \u2265 code 1 or the progression of an existing enamel caries lesion by at least ICDAS \u2265 code 1. These findings are supported by data of Milsom et al.59. In that study, it was found that caries-active children have a 5\u20136 times higher incidence of new cavities compared to caries-free children. In our study we also chose caries-active children (the presence of a caries restoration (filling) on a minimum of 1 primary molar was one of the inclusion criteria) because of the very high prevalence of ECC in developed countries and especially developing countries1,3,8,9,10,11. Consequently, the caries risk of our study populations (i.e. a caries restoration on a minimum of 1 primary molar) represented the average caries risk within children. Thus, the HAP toothpaste was shown to be effective in a general population as well as in high caries-risk group such as orthodontic patients31. The PP and ITT analyses of the primary and secondary endpoint (ICDAS) of our study indicated slightly less, but not statistically different caries development in children that used HAP toothpaste compared to children that used fluoride toothpaste (Tables 2, 3 and 4). These results clearly confirmed the clinical non-inferiority of the HAP toothpaste compared to the fluoride toothpaste. The PP analysis showed that 27.3% children of the HAP group and 25.8% of the children in the fluoride group did not show any change in caries status on the evaluated primary molars during the course of the study.\nIt is well-known that the concentration of fluorides in toothpastes for children (especially for infants and toddlers) has always been balanced against the potential fluorosis-risk16,21,22. Hellwig et al. demonstrated in an in situ study that 500 ppm fluoride significantly remineralized initial caries lesions in deciduous enamel, and this remineralization effect could not be improved by higher fluoride concentrations (i.e. 1,000 and 1,500 ppm fluoride)17. These findings are supported by in vivo data by Biesbrock et al.56. Consequently, we chose as control a toothpaste with 500 ppm fluoride because this represents a good compromise between caries preventing efficacy and fluorosis risk for children of the control group. Furthermore, teeth were brushed three times a day in our study, thus three fluoride impulses (not only 2 \u00d7 daily toothbrushing like recommended by most dentists) were ensured in our study. Finally, we chose amine fluoride (control toothpaste), a more efficient fluoride compound than e.g. sodium fluoride. Amine fluoride shows (in contrast to sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate) antibacterial properties due to the ammonium salt (i.e. the counterion of the fluoride)52,54. Taken together, this proves that the use of the control toothpastes with 500 ppm fluoride provided as amine fluoride has caries preventing effects on the primary dentition. Consequently, the results of our study demonstrated the caries preventive effects of a HAP toothpaste which is non-inferior to a fluoride toothpaste.\nThe amount of toothpaste used in our study was \u2018pea-sized\u2019 because of regulatory reasons on fluoride in toothpastes62. In contrast to fluoride toothpastes, the amount of HAP toothpastes does not have to be \u2018pea-sized\u2019, because of the high biocompatibility of HAP48. However, due to the double-blind study design, the HAP toothpaste could not be dosed higher than the fluoride toothpaste in our study. In principle, the caries preventing effect of the tested HAP toothpaste may be further increased by using higher amounts of this toothpaste. Fabritius-Vilpoux et al., for example, demonstrated in an in vitro scanning electron study that the quantitative adhesion of HAP-particles to enamel surfaces can be increased by higher HAP concentrations in mouthwash formulations34.\nThe clinical non-inferiority of HAP compared to fluorides as shown both in the study of Schlagenhauf et al.31, and in our present study can be explained by different modes of action of HAP in the oral cavity. The modes of action of HAP are based on physical, bio-chemical, and biological principles (for details see e.g. Ref.29). HAP interacts with tooth surfaces and dental plaque30,33,34,43,63,64. Several in situ and in vitro studies have analyzed the modes of action of hydroxyapatite with respect to cavity protection. In situ and in vitro studies were able to show a remineralizing effect of HAP on dentin and enamel32,39,45. Here, TMR (transverse microradiography) was used to measure not only the mineral gain, but also a reduction in lesion depth when using a HAP-toothpaste32,39,42,45. Moreover, HAP significantly reduces bacterial colonization to the tooth surface in situ30. The effect of bacterial reduction to tooth-surfaces is comparable to chlorhexidine30,40. Furthermore, HAP is organized in microclusters, when formulated in toothpastes34. Those microclusters act as soft toothpaste abrasives14,65. Besides that, HAP has been shown to function as calcium- and phosphate-ion releasing active ingredient33. The same study shows its pH-buffering properties when present in acid-producing cariogenic biofilms33,64,66. Recent SEM (scanning electron microscopy) studies clearly confirm the attachment of the active ingredient HAP to the enamel surface as well as to dental materials34,43. Interestingly, Shaw et al., for example, reported significantly higher calcium and phosphorus levels in dental plaque of caries-free children compared to caries-active children67. Consequently, the use of biomimetic HAP as a calcium-phosphate-reservoir in dental plaque of caries-active children seems to be a promising approach to improve tooth remineralization, to decrease the level of tooth demineralization, and thus to reduce the overall caries risk. The simplified chemical equations of HAP acting as a calcium-phosphate-reservoir under acidic conditions (cariogenic biofilms, erosive conditions due to dietary habits etc.) is33:\n-\nCa5(PO4)3(OH) + 7 H+ \u2192 5 Ca2+ + 3 H2PO4- + H2O.\nLimiting factors of our study are as follows. In this study teeth were brushed with electric toothbrushes in the morning and in the evening by the parents in our study. Electric toothbrushes are known to be more efficient in plaque removal compared to manual toothbrushes68. On the other hand, the percentage of users of electric toothbrushes has increased within the last years, especially in developed countries. Since parents brushed the teeth of their child twice a day (the third brushing was performed by the children themselves under supervision of an adult), an influence of the age of the children (i.e. a possible improvement of motor skills within the study course) can be excluded.\nA further limitation of our study is the unknown influence of the diet. It is well-known that sugar consumption and its frequency have a significant influence on caries development13. Here, we did not monitor the diet of each subject as the aim was to test two different toothpastes, but not the influence of the diet on the caries progress. Nevertheless, one may argue that we tested both, the HAP and the fluoride toothpaste, under real-life conditions due to the absence of any specific inclusion or exclusion criteria concerning the diet. However, we can assume that subjects had comparable dietary habits as both study centers are located in urban areas of Poland. A recently published meta-analysis on the nutrient intake by Polish pre-school children showed that the carbohydrate-intake is 24% higher than recommended69.\nA strength of the study is the fact that the influence of other preventive measures (e.g. the use of antiseptics like e.g. chlorhexidine or professional tooth cleaning) were excluded in our study, i.e. the study focused exclusively on toothbrushing with toothpaste (HAP vs. fluoride).\nCaries lesions were assessed with ICDAS, a state-of-the-art system for measuring caries, which was developed by an international team of caries researchers50,51,70. In contrast to the frequently used dmft index, ICDAS offers the advantage to evaluate also initial enamel caries lesions (i.e. caries at a non-cavitated stage)50; thus, compared to dmft index, more caries lesions can be assessed using ICDAS. Investigation of initial caries is of great importance, because these early caries lesions can be remineralized by dental care products for home use either with HAP or fluoride17,32,42. Moreover, in a combined in vivo-in vitro study the use of ICDAS was shown to be more suitable than DIAGNOdent Pen and CarieScan PRO in detecting and assessing occlusal caries in primary molars70. The calculation of interrater reliability in our study indicated a high interrater reliability of the ICDAS scoring throughout the course of our study. This was shown both by the linear weighted and in particular the squared weighted Kappa coefficients between the raters and the benchmark rater (an experienced cariologist) and among the raters themselves (Table 7). Nevertheless, further clinical studies might analyze the impact of HAP toothpastes on DMFS/DMFT [dmfs/dmft] indices, thus making the results also comparable to previously performed studies which focus on fluoride toothpastes16.\nIn general, due to the high risk for young children to develop caries in the primary dentition, as demonstrated in our study as well as previous studies, using a comprehensive caries-preventive approach, i.e. a combination of regular dental visits (at least every 6 months), thorough plaque removal by tooth brushing with electric toothbrush and toothpaste coupled with low sugar consumption13, and when necessary, the application of fissure sealants71,72,73, is well-suited for prevention or at least to significantly reduce the ECC-risk. These preventive measures are very important considering that it was been demonstrated that caries in the primary dentition of 7-year-old Polish children increased the risk for the development of caries in the permanent dentition for more than 5 times8.\nConclusions\nIn children, the impact of the daily use of a toothpaste with microcrystalline HAP on enamel caries progression in the primary dentition is not inferior to that of a fluoride control toothpaste. Thus, the active ingredient hydroxyapatite is a biomimetic alternative to fluorides in toothpastes for children. Unlike fluorides (e.g. risk of dental fluorosis), HAP has a high biocompatibility and is safe if accidentally swallowed.\nReferences\nTinanoff, N. et al.

      "text": "A lot of people are after a brighter, more twinkly smile. While there's no shortage of teeth-whitening kits in your standard dental aisle, there's been some buzz about companies selling toothpaste with one whitening-claiming agent in particular: charcoal.\nSimilar to why people use charcoal face masks, the thinking behind charcoal toothpaste is that its abrasive nature strips away impurities (stains) from the teeth. But it may be a bit too abrasive for the teeth and may even result in the opposite effect of what you're going for, according to Dr. Kami Hoss, a dentist, orthodontist and founder of dental care company SuperMouth.\n\"Charcoal toothpaste has gained renewed attention for its ability to remove surface stains through adsorption, where activated charcoal binds to substances on the teeth,\" Hoss explained in an email. \"However, its abrasive nature can wear down enamel -- the protective outer layer of teeth -- leading to increased sensitivity and a higher risk of cavities.\"\nOver time, this also exposes the dentin layer of the teeth, which has a natural yellowish hue and can cause teeth to \"appear dull,\" Hoss said.\nThe teeth are kind of an odd body part(s) if you think about it. They play a crucial role in our health as they help us eat food and are part of the larger jaw system and skeleton, but they're also subject to our cosmetic interests and medically unnecessary treatments (like whitening) because they're what people see when we communicate and express happiness.\nSince teeth play such a significant and understated role in your life, they deserve your health concerns as well as your aesthetic ones. Here's what we know about charcoal toothpaste's effect on teeth.\nWhat does charcoal toothpaste do to whiten teeth?\nCharcoal toothpaste uses activated charcoal, which is charcoal (the burnt parts you cook with) that has been treated to have a larger surface area and porous structure. The thinking goes that this effectively \"scrubs\" the teeth clean of surface stains.\nDepending on the brand or company making the charcoal toothpaste, the product may contain other main ingredients and different amounts of charcoal.\nIs charcoal toothpaste effective?\nAccording to information from a Penn Dental Medicine blog, charcoal toothpaste has the potential to whiten teeth due to its abrasiveness. Still, it may be less effective than other whitening agents that work by bleaching teeth, like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide.\nA 2023 systematic review of existing studies, for example, found that toothpastes based on activated charcoal posses a \"lower whitening effect\" than alternatives and may pose risks. One 2021 study found that charcoal-based toothpastes weren't significantly different than other types of toothpaste in terms of color change or abrasiveness.\nA 2017 review published in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that there's \"insufficient\" safety and effectiveness data on charcoal-based dentifrices (pastes and powders for teeth cleaning).\nDoes charcoal toothpaste have risks?\nIn addition to charcoal's ability to wear down enamel over time, which increases cavity and sensitivity risk, charcoal toothpaste may get into your gums and cause irritation, according to Hoss.\nHe also warned against regularly using a toothbrush with charcoal bristles.\n\"Charcoal bristles in toothbrushes can be too abrasive for regular use, increasing the risk of enamel damage and sensitivity,\" Hoss said. \"Given these concerns, I do not recommend using charcoal toothpaste or toothbrushes.\"\nSafest ways to whiten your teeth\nIf you want whiter teeth but want to be safe about it, you can inquire about whitening procedures (typically gel or bleaching) at your dentist's office; you may be able to do some of it at home.\nIf you can't spring for in-office treatment or want to keep it simple, you do have options. According to the American Dental Association, most whitening toothpastes on the market \"rely on abrasives\" to whiten teeth, though the degree to which they're abrasive varies. The ADA also points to the fact that whitening toothpastes, in general, are not as effective as teeth whitening strips.\nThe ADA gives its \"seal of acceptance\" on certain products that meet safety and effectiveness standards, so this is a factor to consider when shopping around for a whitening product, whether it be strips or toothpaste. One ADA-accepted home whitening product is Crest 3D Whitestrips Glamorous White strips. One ADA-stamped whitening toothpaste includes Tom's of Maine Simply White toothpaste. When shopping around, you can look for ADA approval and at the ingredients in the paste.\nHoss recommended looking for toothpaste with the ingredient nano-hydroxyapatite, a form of hydroxyapatite. The latter is naturally found in our teeth. (Hoss' company SuperMouth sells products that contain nano-hydroxyapatite.) The restoring effect of hydroxyapatite may assist with whitening by creating a \"smoother, more reflective surface,\" Hoss said. For whitening, he also added that people could use baking soda, which is a mild abrasive.\nIt's also important to note that whitening toothpaste does not necessarily bleach or whiten teeth; rather, it removes surface stains. So even a nonwhitening, regular toothpaste can help keep teeth white by helping maintain the enamel. To reduce the likelihood of stains forming in the first place, rinse out your mouth with water after drinking or eating something that may stain your teeth over time, such as coffee and wine."

      "text": "Brushing with fluoride toothpaste has been shown to reduce caries incidence in children.14 The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine Health and Medicine Division (HMD; formerly the Institute of Medicine, IOM) estimates the amount of fluoride that reduces caries to the greatest extent without causing adverse effects to be 0.05 mg/kg/day (range 0.02 to 0.10 mg/kg/day) for all children older than 6 months.15\nFluorosis may result from excess fluoride ingestion during the period in which permanent teeth are developing.16 Primarily a cosmetic concern, fluorosis can range from mild\u2014in which white flecks or striations appear on the tooth\u2014to severe\u2014which may result in brown spots and/or pitting of the enamel.17\nStudies demonstrate that the amount of toothpaste swallowed is directly associated with the age of the child, with younger children swallowing more than older children when the same amount of toothpaste was used.18 And although a study published in 2019 suggested that children in the US commonly use more toothpaste than is recommended,19 a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis found that the addition of flavoring to toothpaste did not increase ingestion of toothpaste by children.6\nThe ADA recommends that children use a smear of toothpaste (the size of a grain of rice) from the time the first tooth erupts until age 3 years. After that point, from 3 years to 6 years, children should use a pea-sized amount of paste. According to the ADA, these amounts help limit the exposure of children to fluoride from ingested dentifrice to levels below those suggested by the HMD (0.05 mg/kg/day).15 For example, if a child weighing 15 kg brushed twice per day, using a rice-sized smear of toothpaste (approximately 0.1 gram of toothpaste or 0.1 milligram of fluoride), swallowed the entire smear he or she would ingest 0.2 mg of fluoride, resulting in a dose of 0.013 mg/kg. Under those same conditions, the Association estimates, a child using a pea-sized amount (approximately 0.25 g toothpaste or 0.25 mg fluoride) would ingest 0.5 mg fluoride, resulting in a dose of 0.033 mg/kg.20\nIn addition to the appropriate amount of toothpaste to be used, the ADA recommends that caregivers supervise children during brushing to ensure that the children spit rather than swallow the paste.20 Educating caregivers on these recommendations is essential as Zohoori et al. found that, on average, caregivers used up to twice the suggested amount of toothpaste.21"

  "argos_summary": "Teeth whitening can be achieved at home using whitening toothpastes or kits, but results may vary and are generally less effective than professional treatments. Dentist recommendations highlight that while some whitening toothpastes, like Colgate Optic White Pro Series, can effectively remove surface stains, they may not alter the natural color of teeth or treat deeper discoloration. Alternatives like nano-hydroxyapatite toothpastes are gaining popularity as fluoride-free options that can remineralize enamel and reduce sensitivity, though fluoride remains the gold standard for cavity prevention. Ultimately, individuals should consult their dentists for personalized advice on the best whitening methods and products.",
