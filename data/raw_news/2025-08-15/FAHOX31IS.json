  "title": "AT&T Data Breach Payout\u2014Who\u2019s Eligible And How To Make A Claim",
  "description": "Millions of AT&T customers can now file a claim for a payout of up to $7,500. Here's who's eligible and how to claim your share of the class action settlement.",
  "content": "AT&T has suffered two significant data breaches over the last few years and as a result, millions of customers can now file a claim for a payout of up to $7,500.\n\nIt comes after AT&T agreed to a $177 million settlement earlier this year. The first of the two breaches in question came to light in March 2024, when the details of 7.6 million AT&T customers and 65 million former account holders were found on the \u201cdark web\u201d \u2014 the underground version of the internet where cybercriminals operate. The actual breach took place five years earlier in 2019.\n\nThe second, which AT&T admitted to in July 2024, saw nearly customers\u2019 data exposed via third party platform Snowflake in a 2022 incident.\n\nA federal judge in Texas has now given approval for two settlement funds, for $149 million and $28 million.\n\nAT&T denies the allegations and said it had agreed to the settlement to avoid costly litigation.\n\nSo who is eligible, how much do you get and how do you make a claim?\n\nWho Is Eligible For The AT&T Data Breach Payout?\n\nYou might have already received an email about the AT&T class action payout \u2014 in which case, you know you are eligible. It should come from the address attsettlement@e.emailksa.com, so check your junk mail too.\n\nThe first class action payout is for the March 2024 data breach and is labelled AT&T 1 Settlement class, according to the newly-set up settlement website. You can apply if your data \u2014 including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, account passcodes, billing account numbers and social security numbers\u2014 was included in the breach.\n\nMeanwhile AT&T 2 Settlement Class is for users whose information was involved in the 2022 incident. This includes phone numbers of current and former AT&T customers, as well as the numbers of those they interacted with, call durations and \u201cin a small number of cases, the cell site identification numbers associated with the interactions,\u201d according to the website.\n\nHow Much Can I Claim In The AT&T Data Breach Settlement?\n\nHow much you can claim in the AT&T class action payout depends on which settlement you are applying for, but the individual payouts could be hefty. For Settlement 1, you have two options: A documented loss cash payment of up to $5,000 for losses that occurred in 2019 or later; or a tier cash payment, which is a pro rata share of the AT&T 1 net settlement fund cash.\n\nJust to complicate things more, there are two tiers for the latter payment. Tier 1, for AT&T 1 settlement class members who had their social security number exposed, includes a payment five times as large as tier 2, which is for people whose SSNs were not involved in the breach.\n\nFor AT&T 2 settlement class, the documented loss cash payment is up to $2,500 per person for losses that occurred on or after April 14, 2024.\n\nAgain, there is an option for a pro rata share of the AT&T 2 Net Settlement Fund cash.\n\nI contacted AT&T for a comment and will update this article if the firm responds.\n\nYou will need to submit a claim form online by Nov. 18, or you can do so by mail to the address listed on the settlement website.\n\nYou can, of course, apply for both payouts at a total of $7,500, but you will need to file each claim separately.\n\nNote that in both cases, you need to be able to prove you were affected by the AT&T data breach, including any losses you incurred as a result.\n\nA final approval hearing has been set for Dec. 3, after which the settlement payments will start to be sent out, so expect to see your money around the start of 2026.\n\nWith payouts of up to $7,500 per person, the AT&T data breach settlement shows the real impact of people\u2019s data being exposed online. Yet for customers whose details were exposed, the genie is already out of the bottle. When it\u2019s sensitive information such as your social security number, the AT&T class action payout might not seem so large.",

      "text": "AT&T joins a growing and ignominious list of corporate cyberattack victims who share a common story \u2014 inadequate board governance. What\u2019s different is that their board, stacked with former and well-connected CEOs, should have demanded better.\nThe telecom giant shockingly disclosed that, in April, hackers \u201cexfiltrated files\u201d of \u201cnearly all\u201d of AT&T\u2019s over 100 million wireless customers. The stolen 2022 and 2023 records identify customers\u2019 voice and text contacted numbers, frequency, duration and, for some, cell tower locations.\nThat should worry any user or recipient. It concerned federal investigators enough that the U.S. Department of Justice twice demanded AT&T postpone disclosure.\nTech analysts add AT&T to the Snowflake server security lapse in which over 150 well-known companies, including Allstate, Neiman Marcus and Ticketmaster, failed to use simple multi-factor authentication to protect customer data.\nCyber investigative journalist Brian Krebs wrote, \u201cIt remains unclear why so many major corporations persist in the belief that it is somehow acceptable to store so much sensitive customer data with so few security protections. That may be because, apart from the class-action lawsuits that invariably ensue after these breaches, there is little holding companies accountable for sloppy security practices.\u201d\nThe chaos frequently stems from quiet boardrooms where directors too often lack awareness, interest, incentive and/or competence to appreciate and address cyber risk. As for AT&T\u2019s deep board, it\u2019s the proxy statement omissions that tell much.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nShadows Follow\nDespite omnipresent digital danger news and its own lengthy breach history dating back to 2001, AT&T\u2019s dismissive cyber approach hides in plain view.\nIn its eighty-page 2024 proxy statement, the word \u201ccybersecurity\u201d appears just four times \u2014 once in a director\u2019s biography related to private equity experience and the rest stashed in perfunctory board and audit committee duties verbiage.\nLazily, two of investor relations\u2019 four instances repeat verbatim, \u201cThe audit committee also reviews and discusses with management the company\u2019s privacy and data security, including cybersecurity, risk exposures, policies, and practices, including the steps management has taken to detect, monitor and control such risks and the potential impact of those exposures on the company\u2019s business, financial results, operations and reputation\u201d on proxy pages 20 and 36. In one case, a similarly vague statement, \u201cin addition, the audit committee, as well as the board of directors, receive reports from officers with responsibilities for cybersecurity\u201d follows.\nNot surprisingly, its 8-K disclosure about the April breach concludes, \u201cAT&T told the SEC it does not believe this incident is likely to materially impact AT&T\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\u201d That remains to be seen.\nCoincidentally, in April, the FCC fined the big mobile carriers $200 million collectively for knowingly sharing customer data. While AT&T reported over $120 billion in 2023 revenues, materiality can affect the company\u2019s \u201cbusiness, financial results, operations and reputation,\u201d to use the proxy statement\u2019s parlance.\nThat\u2019s exactly what boards so often miss \u2014 a foray into cyber remediation only detours strategy execution. And that\u2019s the last thing CEO John Stankey needs as he enters his fifth year at the helm. Since becoming CEO in mid-2020, AT&T shares are down over 17%, while the S&P and Dow soared 79% and 55%, respectively.\nTele-graft\nThe SEC\u2019s long-awaited regulations exclude board cyber expertise or tech committee requirements. AT&T gladly complied.\nIn May, it re-elected ten board members, seven of whom have been on the board a decade or more. That\u2019s classic entrenchment.\nThe proxy bundles technology with innovation as a qualification, provides no skills definition and tags five directors (Stankey, Marissa Mayer, Glenn Hutchins, Stephen Luczo and Luis Ubi\u00f1as) with such experience. All warrants a much closer look.\nIts newest member, AI startup Sunshine Products CEO and Walmart director, 48 year-old tech magnate Mayer, lowers the board\u2019s average age to 64. She headed Yahoo! during its notorious cyber woes and eventual sale to Verizon.\nStankey, an executive holdover from the Time Warner divestiture, did serve briefly as AT&T\u2019s CIO and CTO from 2003-2006. Luczo is a managing partner of Crosspoint Capital, a private equity firm \u201cfocused on cybersecurity and data privacy.\u201d He is also the former chair and CEO of data storage firm Seagate.\nThe others are a stretch. The proxy indicates that, investment banker and Brookings Institution co-chair, Hutchins, \u201cbrings significant leadership, business planning and human capital management expertise.\u201d Ubi\u00f1as, a former McKinsey partner and Ford Foundation head, now chairs the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation.\nThe others, alphabetically, bring political, executive and financial services chops.\n- Scott Ford, board director since 2012, is the current CEO of Westrock Coffee Company and former head of telecom Alltell, now part of Verizon. He \u201chas experience managing complex business operations in various regulatory environments internationally and has led several major business transformations.\u201d\n- William Kennard, the board\u2019s chair, trained as a lawyer and served in senior jobs at the FCC in the 1990s. His career later included stints at Carlyle asset management and as the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n- Michael McAllister is health care provider Humana\u2019s former CEO.\n- Beth Mooney, KeyCorp bank\u2019s former CEO and chair, served at the Federal Reserve.\n- Matthew Rose is the former CEO and chair of rail company BNSF.\n- Cynthia Taylor is currently CEO of energy firm Oil States International. She is a CPA with experience at EY and the Federal Reserve.\nIn a c-suite credentialed room, couldn\u2019t someone push for more cyber attention?\nHigh-profile board appointments bring great pay and access. Each pocketed over $400,000 in 2023 and with chair Kennard hauling in over $850,000. Stankey tallied over $22 million annually in total compensation in each of the past three years.\nNow they have a mess that may very well \u201cbecome\u201d material. In addition to likely customer payouts and class action settlements, do congressional hearings, regulatory sanctions and remediation penalties loom? That erodes c-suite strategy time.\nPerhaps, ultimately, for marquee boards, crisis navigation outpoints stewardship. But is the golden parachute worth the career crash? And where might 100+ million customers go to get their privacy and security back? Who\u2019s your board calling?"

      "text": "Google has issued a security update for its Chrome browser which you should apply right now. That\u2019s because Google has fixed six issues in its widely-used browser, half of which are rated as having a high severity.\nThe Chrome Stable channel has been updated to 139.0.7258.127/.128 for Windows, Mac and 139.0.7258.127 for Linux, Google said in an advisory published on the Chrome blog. The Chrome update will roll out over the coming days and weeks, according to Google.\nThe latest Google Chrome security fixes come just one week after the browser maker issued an update for eight flaws and two weeks following an emergency patch for a high severity vulnerability. The Chrome update also comes after Apple released iOS 18.6, fixing a hefty list of 29 security flaws.\nGoogle doesn\u2019t give a lot of detail about what\u2019s fixed in Chrome 139.0.7258.127/.128. This is because it doesn\u2019t want adversaries to get hold of the specifics before as many Chrome users as possible have updated their browsers.\n\u201cAccess to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix,\u201d Google wrote in its blog. \u201cWe will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven\u2019t yet fixed,\u201d Google explained\nHigh Severity Issues Fixed In Google Chrome\nCVE-2025-8879 is a heap buffer overflow flaw in libaom, which is rated as having a high impact. Meanwhile, CVE-2025-8880 is a race issue in V8 that Google has also rated as having a high severity.\nThe last high severity vulnerability is CVE-2025-8901, an out of bounds write issue in ANGLE, which allows a remote attacker to perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.\nGoogle details two of the medium severity flaws, CVE-2025-8881, an inappropriate implementation issue in File Picker and CVE-2025-8882, a use after free vulnerability in Aura.\nNone of the flaws fixed in Google Chrome have been used in real-life attacks, but some of the issues are pretty serious \u2014 especially those that can be exploited by remote attackers.\nWhile Google says the Chrome update will be rolling out in the coming days and weeks, this, combined with the number of security flaws, makes it a good idea to update manually now.\nTo update Chrome to the latest version go to the Help|About Google Chrome option from your web browser settings menu and follow the prompts. Once you have upgraded Chrome, you need to ensure you relaunch your browser to activate the update."

      "text": "Update, Jan. 6, 2025: This story, originally published Jan. 3, now includes more details of who is eligible to claim and instructions on how to disable Siri, as well as a statement from Apple.\nApple users could soon be eligible for a cash payout after the iPhone maker agreed to pay $95 million to settle a class action case including alleged Siri eavesdropping.\nA preliminary settlement, filed Dec. 13, 2024, in Oakland, California is now awaiting approval by a U.S. district judge, Reuters reports.\nThe lawsuit alleges Apple was infringing privacy by capturing Siri conversations when the voice assistant had been activated accidentally and sharing this information with advertisers. It dates back to 2019, when U.K. newspaper The Guardian reported that Apple employed contractors to listen to Siri recordings of private conversations including medical appointments, sexual encounters and drug deals.\nApple got into hot water at the time because although the iPhone maker did say recordings from Siri could be listened to, it did not explicitly state that there was human oversight of the voice assistant. The new Siri lawsuit alleges that Apple didn\u2019t inform people they were regularly being recorded without consent.\nIn the latest Siri eavesdropping case, two plaintiffs alleged that they mentioned Air Jordan shoes and their iPhones showed adverts for the product. Another claimed he received medical ads after discussing a specific surgical treatment with his doctor.\nSo, who could be eligible for a payout once a district judge approves the Siri eavesdropping settlement \u2014 and what should you do to ensure privacy when using Apple\u2019s voice assistant?\nWho Could Be Eligible For The Siri Eavesdropping Payout?\nNow that the case has been settled and received preliminary approval, it\u2019s likely Siri users will be able to make a claim.\nIf you owned an Apple Siri-enabled device between Sept. 17, 2014, and Dec. 31 2024, you could be eligible to claim. You also need to be based in the U.S. However, to get a share of the fee, you\u2019ll need to swear under oath that you experienced Siri activating unintentionally and had private conversations recorded by the voice assistant.\nApple has proposed a decision date of Feb. 14 in the Californian court.\nA website to confirm this will be set up within 45 days, and you then have until May 15, 2025, to file your claim.\nHow Much Will Apple Pay Siri Users?\nAs it stands, Apple will pay out $20 to Siri users, but the good news is, you can submit a claim for each of the devices you use, up to five devices, or $100 total. The settlement payment could be higher depending on the number of claims submitted and approved.\nWhere Will The Total $95 Million Go?\nThe cash won\u2019t all go to Apple Siri users. Some of the money will go to the legal teams, which could take 30% of the fee plus expenses \u2014 a total of just under $30 million.\nIt might sound like a big payout, but the money won\u2019t make a huge dent in Apple\u2019s profits. The iPhone maker made $93.74 billion in its latest fiscal year.\nApple Speaks Out About Siri Eavesdropping Claims\nApple has shared an on-the-record statement over email.\n\u201cSiri has been engineered to protect user privacy from the beginning,\u201d an Apple spokesperson says. \u201cSiri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose.\u201d\nApple settled this case to avoid additional litigation \u201cso we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019,\u201d the Apple spokesperson adds. \u201cWe use Siri data to improve Siri, and we are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private.\u201d\nThroughout the entirety of the lawsuit, Apple emphasizes the fact that it has denied the allegation it uses Siri recordings to target advertisements for users.\nIn fact, what you share with Siri is never shared with advertisers and there has been no evidence in this lawsuit or elsewhere that Apple uses Siri recordings to target advertisements for users, the iPhone maker says. Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose.\nSiri is designed to do as much learning as possible offline, on the device. For Apple Intelligence requests that use Private Cloud Compute, your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple, the iPhone maker says\nApple Intelligence offers additional protections, and no user data is used to train Apple Intelligence foundation models.\nAt the same time, Siri uses as little data as possible to deliver an accurate result. When you ask a question about a sporting event, for example, Siri uses your general location to provide suitable results. But if you ask for the nearest grocery store, more specific location data is used.\nIf you ask Siri to read your unread messages, Siri simply instructs your device to read these aloud. The contents of your messages aren\u2019t transmitted to Apple\u2019s servers, because that isn\u2019t necessary to fulfill your request, Apple says.\nSiri uses a random identifier \u2014 a long string of letters and numbers associated with a single device \u2014 to keep track of data while it\u2019s being processed, rather than tying it to your identity through your Apple Account or phone number. The iPhone maker believes this process is unique among the digital assistants in use today. For further protection, after six months, your request history is disassociated from the random identifier, Apple says.\nFor capable devices, the audio of a user's requests is processed entirely on their device using the Apple Neural Engine unless they choose to share it with Apple. This is available on iPhone with A12 Bionic and later for supported languages and requires download of speech models.\nApple may use Siri transcript data to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, Search and limited other language processing functionality in Apple products and services. But users have the ability to review and delete their Siri transcripts directly in Settings.\nThe voice assistant\u2019s data collection for analytics is now opt-in only, a change made in 2019 following the original claims.\nApple\u2019s 2019 changes include no longer retaining audio recordings of Siri interactions. Instead, the firm continues to use computer-generated transcripts to help Siri improve.\nWhen customers opt in, only Apple employees are allowed to listen to audio samples of the Siri interactions. The team works to delete any recording determined to be an inadvertent trigger of Siri, the iPhone maker says.\nSiri Eavesdropping\u2014Should You Quit The Voice Assistant Following The Claims?\nIt\u2019s important to note that Apple hasn\u2019t admitted any wrongdoing in the Siri eavesdropping case and there is no concrete proof that the iPhone maker passed recordings to advertisers. Data is collected to improve Siri only and this is anonymized and not associated with a particular user, Apple says.\nApple said it \u201ccontinues to deny any and all alleged wrongdoing and liability, specifically denies each of the Plaintiffs' contentions and claims, and continues to deny that the Plaintiffs' claims and allegations would be suitable for class action status,\u201d according to the filing.\nThe iPhone maker is simply settling the Siri case to avoid costly litigation fees. According to reports, Apple could have been liable to pay $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.\nThe Apple Siri case is the latest class action against voice assistant spying. The same law firm is also suing Google in a similar lawsuit.\nHow To Disable Siri On An iPad or Mac\nIf you are concerned about privacy, there are several ways you can lock Siri down.\nOn an in iOS device such as an iPhone or iPad, you can do this in your Settings > Siri > Talk to Siri > Off.\nYou can also tap to turn off Press Home for Siri or Press Side Button for Siri to prevent the voice assistant being activated altogether.\nOn a Mac device, you can control Siri by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner, then clicking System Settings > Siri & Spotlight. Toggle off Ask Siri.\nThe potential for spying might be a worry, but Apple offers plenty of privacy settings to prevent Siri eavesdropping on your conversations.\nIf you are really concerned about Siri eavesdropping, you could turn off the voice assistant altogether. Apple is increasing using artificial intelligence to boost Siri, and some users just won\u2019t be comfortable with that."

You\u2019re not alone \u2014 and rest assured, it\u2019s nothing to worry about. The new black dot is part of Apple\u2019s iOS 18.4 update.\nIn a post on Reddit, also reported by Unilad, one user posted a picture of the mystery dot, which had appeared on their iPhone 16 after upgrading to iOS 18.4, to the right of the Dynamic Island.\nMany people thought it was a bug since upgrading to iOS 18, with others joking about the new black dot. \u201cYour Dynamic Island had a baby. Congrats!!!\u201d one Reddit user wrote.\n\u201cThey changed it so now when there\u2019s an active activity on the dynamic island the privacy indicator moves to the side,\u201d another Reddit user replied. And they\u2019re right.\niOS 18.4 Privacy Indicator Dot\nThe dot \u2014 or privacy indicator \u2014 is an intentional feature added by Apple in iOS 18.4, but the dots have been there in general since iOS 14. The orange dot on your iPhone reveals that the camera is in use, in case an app or service is using it without your knowledge.\nThe dot can also appear if someone has activated the camera intentionally during a cyberattack, for example using spyware. Meanwhile, the green dot will light up when your iPhone microphone is in use, so don\u2019t be surprised if this happens when you are on a call.\nIn iOS 18.4, a black outline has been added to the orange and green dots to make them more obvious. This was reported on Mar.21 by Apple-focused website MacRumors. \u201cThe small dots that show up on the iPhone\u2019s menu bar when the camera or microphone is in use have been moved to the left and are now more apparent thanks to a black background,\u201d the site writes.\nBlack iPhone Dot \u2014 What To Do If The Indicator Is Lit\nSo now you know what the black dot is on your iPhone. So what should you do if you see a black dot (or indeed, an orange or green indicator) on your iPhone?\nFirst of all, check that you aren\u2019t using your iPhone mic or camera in an obvious way. For example, you might be on the phone or using FaceTime and notice the dot is lit. That\u2019s fine and is just your iPhone working in its normal way.\nIf that isn\u2019t the case, check apps that have access to your camera or mic in your Settings > Privacy & Security and go through each of them to see if anything is obvious there. While you are doing so, revoke access to any apps that shouldn\u2019t need to use these two things. A take-out app shouldn\u2019t need this level of access, for example.\nIf you have done this and the orange or green light is still lit, there is a chance someone has taken control of your camera or mic by different means. Don\u2019t panic, unless you are a journalist, government worker, dissident or business operating in certain sectors, you are unlikely to be a target.\nHowever, if you are a possible target for spyware \u2014 which sees adversaries take control of your device including the camera and mic \u2014 there are apps such as iVerify which claim they can help detect this.\nAnother thing you can do to disrupt spyware temporarily is, turn your device off and on again. If you do discover or strongly suspect spyware, however, the best thing to do is stop using your iPhone altogether and contact an organization such as Amnesty International for help.\niOS 18.5 Arriving Any Minute Now With Privacy Features\nThe iPhone black dot isn\u2019t the only privacy feature that comes with Apple\u2019s iOS 18 upgrade. Indeed, some new privacy features are about to arrive with Apple\u2019s iOS 18.5 update, which is due any minute now.\nWhen iOS 18.5 does land, it\u2019ll include a new privacy-focused AI training system. This news was reported by Bloomberg, which said the iPhone maker is planning to boost its AI, Apple Intelligence, while prioritizing user privacy.\nApple has been criticized for being slow to embrace AI features, however, this pace is largely down to the iPhone maker\u2019s attitude to privacy. Currently, it uses synthetic data rather than actual user information to train its models on emails and summarisation capabilities. But this means it doesn\u2019t always get the best data to train its models, which will impact its AI overall.\nIn iOS 18.5, Apple will change this with new techniques to enable it to \u201cdiscover usage trends and aggregated insights to improve features powered by Apple Intelligence,\u201d without revealing individual behavior or unique content to Apple.\nThe thing that enables Apple to do so is an approach it calls \u201cdifferential privacy,\u201d which it already uses as part of its opt-in device analytics program for tools such as Genmoji.\nApple will use the same approach to boost AI features such as Writing Tools, which will first generate synthetic data and then poll opted-in devices with snippets. As part of this, it will ask people to confirm how accurate the snippets are and compare them to its models so it can improve them.\n\u201cThis synthetic data can then be used to test the quality of our models on more representative data and identify areas of improvement for features like summarisation,\u201d Apple said.\nApple\u2019s iOS 18 includes AI features that are some of the most private out there because it processes as much data as possible on the actual device. Meanwhile, more resource heavy queries are sent to its Private Cloud Compute, a fully encrypted private cloud.\nApple iOS 18.5 is coming very soon, possibly today or tomorrow, so keep checking my Forbes page and your Settings > General > Software Update for its arrival.\niOS 18 Black iPhone Dot Is A Feature, Not A Bug\nSo there you have it. The black dot on your iPhone after upgrading to iOS 18.4 is not a bug at all. It\u2019s a privacy enhancement that helps keep your iPhone safe.\nIf you haven\u2019t upgraded your iPhone yet, now is the time to do it, because iOS 18.4 and the latest version iOS 18.4.1 include important security features too. Go to Settings > General > Security Update and upgrade your iPhone when you can."

      "text": "Tea, an app that allows women to post pictures of men they\u2019re dating for feedback, is going viral. Tea is now the No. 1 lifestyle app in the App Store, with over 1 million women signing up over the past week.\nMarketed as an online dating safety app, Tea allows its users to post photos of men and ask others for \u201ctea\u201d \u2014 in other words, dirt or gossip \u2014 on them. It is gaining popularity on TikTok, particularly among Gen Z users.\nLaunched by founder Sean Cook after he witnessed his mother get catfished online, Tea\u2019s aims are noble. The app includes numerous positive reviews from women who have used it. However, experts point out numerous issues with Tea.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the viral dating safety app.\nWhat Does The App Do?\nUnlike dating apps, the purpose of Tea is to verify the identity of people on match-making apps. It\u2019s not doing anything new \u2014 there have long been Facebook groups where women share pictures of men they\u2019re dating to check for red flags.\nPowered by AI-driven safety technology and real-time identity verification tools, the aim is for women to have the power to discreetly check that the men they\u2019re dating are who they say.\nFeatures include reverse image search, with users able to catch catfish and fake profiles by dropping a screenshot into Tea\u2019s Catfish Finder AI.\nPhone number lookup helps verify if someone has a hidden marriage or concerning history with their phone number.\nBackground checks include the ability to access public records, sex offender maps and criminal history to assess if your date is safe to meet up with in real life.\nThe app includes an anonymous space where women can share dating experiences, ask for advice and leave honest feedback on past partners called Tea Party Group Chat.\nWho Can Use The Tea App?\nThe Tea app is for women only. The app uses an identity verification process to ensure only women are joining.\nTea\u2019s SafeSip AI Moderation technology automatically detects and removes potentially harmful content, the app\u2019s owners say.\nWhat Measures Does Tea Have To Prevent Abuse?\nTea is very much geared toward its users, who are women. For example, it includes protection to prevent people from screenshotting inside the app. It also offers the opportunity to \u201cgreen flag\u201d men, verifying that they\u2019re good guys.\nYet for the men whose pictures are posted on Tea, things aren\u2019t as simple as for the women who use it. Photos can be posted without their permission. And, as an article on Dazed points out, while abusers might forfeit their right to privacy, is it fair to doxx someone and share their private information online in this way?\nAt the same time, is ghosting someone really bad enough for the man to be named and shamed online?\nMeanwhile, users could find themselves in legal hot water if they publish defamatory posts about men online. And worse, when this information is out there, it could lead to huge impacts on the mental health of those who could feel they are unfairly accused.\nAttorney William Barnwell told Fox 2 that men could have civil legal recourse if the posts affect their work, family life or reputation, as defamation might apply.\n\u201cI could see some areas where this could cause people some big problems,\u201d said Barnwell. \u201cTruth is an absolute defense for a defamation claim; you can\u2019t just sue someone because your feelings are hurt.\u201d\n\u201cThe app could easily be used to spread unverified accusations \u2014 especially with its anonymous nature \u2014 and could even be used as a revenge tool,\u201d says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET. \u201cWhile its intentions are simple and protective, the unregulated format could unfortunately open it up to abuse.\u201d\nMen have expressed concern on Reddit, on various threads, detailing how the app could impact them, with some attempting to have their photos removed.\nI have contacted Tea for a comment and will update this article if the app maker responds.\nThe Tea App \u2014 What To Do\nThe Tea app is currently available in the U.S., and regulation could stop it from launching elsewhere. The EU, for example, is covered by strict data protection measures, the GDPR.\nIf you do use Tea or are thinking of doing so, the app does have good intentions. But proceed with caution, taking into account the regulation in your region."
