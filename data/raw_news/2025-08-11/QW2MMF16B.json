  "title": "Coleman\u2019s Camp Chair vs. Yeti\u2019s Trailhead: One\u2019s $250 Cheaper and Punches Well Above Its Weight",
  "description": "I took two popular chairs at opposite ends of the price spectrum and put them to the test to see who is best.",
  "content": "If I were to ask you if you prefer Coleman or Yeti, you might assume I was talking about coolers. The brand\u2019s respective red-and-white and behemoth, coffin-size ice chests are what they made their names on. But here, we\u2019re talking camp chairs.\n\nIf you only know them through their coolers, you\u2019ve already got a great sense of how each brand approaches its chairs, too. Coleman prioritizes simplicity and affordability. Yeti spares no expense to build its out to the nth degree. If you\u2019re on the checkout page debating between saving a few bucks on a Coleman chair or splurging on a Yeti, there\u2019s no right answer.\n\nI\u2019ve tested dozens of different camp chairs in a range of price points. The Coleman portable camp chair and the Yeti Trailhead camp chair represent different ends of the price spectrum. Each has a similar build and basic design that make them worthy picks regardless of needs. So, in short, you\u2019re looking at two comparable chairs with one built for shoppers on a budget and the other designed with premium performance in mind. Not sure which one is better suited to your needs? I put each chair through the wringer, and here\u2019s what I think.\n\nFirst thing to note before diving any deeper: The Coleman costs about 250 dollars less than the Yeti. That may be all you need to read from this article to decide on which to buy; 300 bucks is steep for a camp chair. The price difference didn\u2019t affect how I tested each chair in comparison to one another, but it was certainly kept in mind when weighing both options in terms of overall value.\n\nI tested both chairs in several key aspects such as comfort, durability, portability, and any extra features they offer. I sat in the chairs, packed them up, carried them on long walks, and used any additional features as intended. I also made a point of using both camp chairs in everyday life, taking them to the beach and using them in back patio hangouts with friends to get a sense of how they actually work and feel in real world settings.\n\nThe Coleman portable camp chair is about as straightforward as it gets. It\u2019s made of an alloy steel frame and polyester seat cover, which are fine. As a result, the comfort is standard as well. The material is sturdy and flexible but offers little give. I don\u2019t consider the chair supportive, though it certainly isn\u2019t uncomfortable either. There is some cushioning woven in the polyester that I appreciated compared to camp chairs without it, like the portability-focused Helinox Chair One (re). Over the course of a few hours of sitting, drinking, and talking, that cushioning started paying off. That said, it didn\u2019t blow my mind.\n\nBeyond just the feel of the seat, I also was satisfied with the arm rests. They are the same polyester material as the main seat cover, and feel fine against bare skin. The arm rests are also partially adjustable\u2014the back end slides up and down on the alloy frame for different resting angles.\n\nThe Yeti Trailhead also has an alloy steel frame, but instead of polyester, the camp chair is a material the company calls FlexGrid. It\u2019s essentially a textured mesh that, like the name suggests, is incredibly flexible. Unlike the Coleman\u2019s polyester, the FlexGrid fabric stretched and moved slightly with your body, providing some much-appreciated give. The chair material actually stretched to better cradle my body, making it quite comfortable to sit in. This was true even after several hours of lounging, changing positions, and relaxing. It\u2019s probably one of the few camp chairs that I would actually choose to sit in over more conventional seating options.\n\nLike most camp chairs, the Coleman folds up and in so it can fit into a bag, which has a shoulder strap for easier carrying. The entire chair and bag weigh slightly over 7 pounds. This made it quite comfortable to sling over my shoulder and walk for a while without any issue. I easily trekked a little over a mile and didn\u2019t need a moment to rest or readjust.\n\nSimilarly, with pretty tight dimensions when folded up, the camp chair fits into car trunks and backseats with tons of room to spare. Even when I stored it in a two-seat sedan with minimal storage space, it fit in the trunk without any trouble.\n\nWhile the Yeti Trailhead also folds in like the Coleman, carrying it is a very different experience. The chair weighs a little over 13 pounds, which doesn\u2019t seem like a major difference but adds up over a long walk. However, the company accounts for this by providing a case that comes with two shoulder straps instead of one so you can wear the chair like a backpack. This helps lessen the load especially for beach days or camping trips where you\u2019ll likely be walking over uneven ground. That said, the backpack-style case also prevents you from carrying other items at the same time like coolers or daypacks.\n\nI personally liked the backpack straps but do admit that it\u2019s a bit awkward to have the chair in the center of my back. Unless I cinched the straps very tight, I could feel the chair sway while I walked. For someone short like me, the chair also hit the back of my legs if I was walking downhill or with a little speed.\n\nConsidering its weight, the Yeti camp chair is better suited for activities where you\u2019re near a car and don\u2019t have to carry it on your shoulders for long stretches of time. It fits comfortably in most trunks and, much like the Coleman, didn\u2019t have any problems fitting in compact cars.\n\nConsidering the price tag, the Coleman is far more durable that you might expect. With so few moving parts, nearly everything except for the rubber feet are made of alloy steel or durable polyester. On the whole, the chair is designed to handle up to 325 pounds, which should accommodate most people with zero issue.\n\nThe steel alloy frame is also naturally resistant to rust or corrosion. You\u2019ll still need to wipe it down occasionally, but can expect it to generally hold up without any major issues. Similarly, the polyester chair is sturdy enough to withstand scratches, stretching, and light water damage. While I wouldn\u2019t recommend leaving the chair outside every single day, it can hold up to a few rainy nights without issue. Beyond the technical specs, Coleman also offers a one-year limited warranty on the camp chair.\n\nAs expected, the Yeti camp chair is also incredibly durable. Both the steel frame and FlexGrid fabric are both UV rated, meaning neither will fade, chip, disintegrate, or break down if left out in the sun. This also makes the camp chair great as a semi-permanent addition around a patio or home fire pit. The FlexGrid fabric and alloy steel frame are rated to handle up to 500 pounds, which is more than you\u2019ll ever really need and should work for virtually any person who wants to sit down in it (and dog who may jump on their lap). This is a nearly 200 pound difference in comparison to the Coleman.\n\nWhile neither chair comes with a ton beyond the physical chair and the carrying case, there are still a few small features each offers that I really enjoyed. Both the Coleman and Yeti come with cupholders, though Coleman\u2019s is integrated directly in the arm rest. This works perfectly fine, though I\u2019d prefer not to give up arm space to my drink. The Trailhead\u2019s cupholder, on the other hand, is detachable and connects to the chair\u2019s legs instead. This made it easier for me to comfortably relax my arms without worrying about accidentally scratching my hand on an open can.\n\nBeyond just cupholders, the Yeti\u2019s feet are extra wide and pivot for greater stability and so that they can adapt to the uneven surfaces\u2014not a common feature on camp chairs. Furthermore, all the feet rotate back and forth for a sturdier base on uneven ground. This came in handy for me after setting up on a slight hill and watching all the camp chairs fall over except for my Trailhead.\n\nWhile the Coleman is largely a simple chair, it comes with two major storage attachments that I love. On one side, the chair has a side pocket with a mesh netting. This is perfect for sliding in a wallet or phone. It\u2019s wide enough to hold a book or e-reader as well, which is great for long days sitting out in the sun. As much as I enjoy that pocket, on the other side of the chair, the Coleman has a small zip-up cooler, which I used a ton. It\u2019s integrated into the left arm rest and holds up to four cans depending on their size and shape. While you shouldn\u2019t expect top-tier insulation, I was pleasantly surprised at how long the cans stayed cool on a hot day. Expect a couple of hours of truly cold cans and several hours of cool or below room temperature cans. If you throw in an ice pack, you give up a bit of space but add a lot of time where those drinks stay frosty.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a definitive right answer between the two camp chairs. The Coleman is an affordable option that comes with a few tricks up its sleeve that make it one of the best bang-for-your-buck camp chairs out there. At the same time, the Yeti is a comfortable, durable chair that is built to last for years, justifying the price tag several times over. If you want a chair that you can throw over your shoulder for a couple beach trips and bonfires every year, the Coleman is the choice for you. If you are looking for one that doesn\u2019t need to be hauled long distances and can become a more semi-permanent part of your yard or patio for years without needing to be replaced, go for the Yeti.",

      "text": "The 6 Best Coolers for Campsites and Backyard Hangs\nWe tested coolers from brands like Yeti, Coleman, and RTIC to find the most durable and reliable models worth buying.\nGear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nPacking a cooler should give you the same anticipatory buzz as packing for a trip, and just as you wouldn\u2019t take a rolling duffel for an overnight getaway, your cooler needs to match your beach, hiking, or camping excursions. There are tons of cooler styles\u2014hard sided, mini coolers, wheeled options, backpack styles\u2014and the right one for you depends on where you\u2019ll take it and what you\u2019ll fill it with.\nWe tested out a bunch of hard-sided coolers from top brands like Yeti, Coleman, and a slew of others to examine every minute detail. Components like thick gaskets in the lid, all-terrain wheels, and drain channels with handy plugs contribute to a cooler's ease of use and overall performance.\nWhether you\u2019re planning a week-long excursion or just soaking up some sun for the day, there\u2019s a cooler that will keep both you and your provisions chilled out.\nThe Best Coolers We Recommend\n- Most Durable: Yeti Tundra 45\n- Best Lightweight: Coleman Pro Cooler\n- Best Wheeled: RTIC Wheeled Ultra-Tough Cooler\n- Best With Dry Storage: Ninja FrostVault Cooler\n- Most Effective Insulation: Oyster Tempo Performance Cooler\nWhat to Consider\nHow much are you going to pack in your cooler?\nCapacity is the biggest determining factor when buying a cooler. For instance, if you want a cooler to take to the beach or to tailgates, you probably don\u2019t need one that\u2019s 70 liters and meant to hold a week\u2019s worth of food and water (though if your plans are with a large group, you\u2019ll probably want about 50 liters). Soft coolers are great for keeping groceries cold mid-transit or bringing beverages to the park for a couple of hours.\nSome hard coolers are more durable than others.\nAny brand can make promises about the proprietary technology it uses to keep things cold, but most popular cooler companies use the same methods for keeping things insulated. High-end hard coolers are often roto-molded, which refers to the plastic manufacturing process that creates coolers without seams or stress points, making them extremely durable.\nThe process creates plastic walls injected with open or closed cell foam to reduce heat conduction. It also gives these coolers a smooth, premium look and finish. Roto-molding only affects durability\u2014coolers that aren\u2019t roto-molded have the same insulation performance. If you prioritize durability or are particularly hard on your gear, you should look for a roto-molded cooler. Soft coolers use coated polyurethane or Mylar to reflect heat.\nLook for features that improve portability and ease of use.\nMost hard coolers weigh upwards of roughly 20 pounds empty. Fill the cooler with ice and beverages and carrying it becomes a two-person job. These days, coolers have a host of portability features that are often worth spending extra on if you use your cooler a lot. Things like periscopic handles made of aluminum or heavy-duty plastic and oversized wheels for hauling over rough terrain are just a few to consider.\nAs mentioned above, coolers with thick gaskets in the lid and drain channels with grippy plugs, for example, make a big difference in how much you enjoy using your cooler and how well it performs in real-world situations. There are also coolers with dry baskets inside or exterior food drawers so you don't have to open the cooler every time you want a snack.\nHow We Selected and Tested\nWe looked to brands with a longstanding reputation for producing high-quality products, including Yeti, Coleman, RTIC, and others. Many of the coolers are owned and used by our team and other members of our staff for camping, beach trips, and backyard barbecues. Collectively, we've tested them for several consecutive summers to get a feel for their insulation capabilities, durability, portability, and ease of use, plus things like extra storage compartments and included accessories.\nFor this update, we're performing additional testing on models we've previously covered and have also called in several coolers that looked promising based on specs and innovative design details, including the Ninja FrostVault, the Dometic Recon cooler, the RTIC Wheeled Ultra-Tough, which we've previewed below. Our next update is slated for early August.\nDanny Perez is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics with a focus on men's style, gear, and home goods.

Coolers for camping need to have reliable insulation to ensure your food stays edible for days on end and your post-hike beers stay chilled.\nCamping coolers are tricky since you don\u2019t really know how they\u2019ll perform until you\u2019ve used them\u2014that\u2019s why we got several coolers in hand and tried them out ourselves. In addition to our own testing, we researched the most important specs to look out for and spoke with Samara Robbins, senior project manager of hard coolers at Yeti.\nYou don\u2019t need to have a degree in thermodynamics or product design to pick a good cooler but knowing what to look for and how to pack it will ensure you\u2019re hydrated and fed on your next campout (and maybe a little buzzed after that last hike).\nThe Best Coolers for Camping\n- Best Overall: Yeti Tundra 45\n- Best Budget Option: Coleman 316 Series Cooler\n- Best Value: Lifetime High Performance Cooler\n- Best Mid-Sized Cooler: RTIC Ultra-light Cooler\n- Most Lightweight Option: Oyster Tempo Cooler\nWhat to Consider\nEfficient Packing\nSpending top dollar on a camping cooler can get you a durable option with great insulation but it\u2019s all for nought if you\u2019re packing inefficiently. Using ice to keep things cold works but using reusable ice packs last a lot longer. You want to pack your ice and groceries tightly to minimize the amount of dead space, where cold temperatures can start warming up. We also suggest that you layer ice packs\u2014or ice if you insist\u2014between provisions.\nDon\u2019t just fill your cooler and dump ice on top or place your items on a layer of ice packs and expect them to keep over a camping trip. If you don\u2019t want to buy ice packs, fill up water bottles and freeze them overnight and they\u2019ll have the same effect. You can also get an old coffee can and freeze water in it to make an ice block that\u2019ll last longer than a bag of cubed ice.\nRobbins suggests choosing a cooler with a cubic design\u2014some coolers have indentations, tiers, or slanted bottoms for draining or organization purposes. While it\u2019s convenient in some ways, it makes packing a bit harder when you\u2019re trying to perfectly fit everything you need, Tetris-style.\nInsulation\nCoolers use layers of insulation to trap and maintain the interior temperature while keeping the ambient temperature out. Brands achieve this by injecting the walls of coolers with foam insulation\u2014the more insulation, the better the cooler is at keeping stuff cold. You can gauge the insulating properties by looking at the thickness of the cooler walls. A couple of the options we recommend have three inches of insulation which you can be sure will keep your food cold if you pack efficiently.\nAnother sign your cooler is designed perform well is a gasket on the lid. This is a seal, usually made of rubber, that ensures no cold air escapes. A thick gasket bolsters your camping cooler\u2019s insulating abilities and is a must if you\u2019re planning for a days-long trip.\nWhile you can\u2019t see what kind of insulation is used in each camping cooler, we note those that state they use closed-cell insulation. Closed-cell insulation is foam that\u2019s dense and rigid, with its air bubbles completely closed off and separated from one another. This makes it harder for heat to pass through and is therefore a more effective insulator.\nOpen-cell insulation is flexible and lightweight, but a lot of air bubbles touch, making them permeable to heat and therefore less insulating. Backpack coolers and lunch bags use open-cell foam for its portability and compactness but we suggest hard coolers with closed-cell insulation and note the models that employ it.\nThe only camping cooler we recommend that doesn\u2019t use foam insulation is the Oyster Tempo\u2014instead it uses vacuum-sealed walls which is ideal for insulation.\nDurability\nA camping cooler should last you more than a handful of trips and the ones we recommend are built of sturdy plastics but can be constructed in different ways. Rotomolding\u2014or rotational molding\u2014is a plastic manufacturing process that creates an object without seams or stress points making them extremely durable. It also gives them a smooth, premium finish as it evenly layers plastic to create the cooler. Injection molding is when the plastic is injected into molds.\nBoth have their pros and cons, Robbins says. \u201cRotomolding has become a buzzy marketing term but it has its problems like anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cRotomolding is expensive and takes a long time so it produces a more expensive product.\u201d\nIt also isn\u2019t an be-all-end-all feature as the molding process is less precise, and can hide flaws that slip through quality control like small holes in the walls. Robbins says \u201cinjection molding can be just as durable and produce a camping cooler without seams\u201d though some cheaper injection-molded coolers do have stress points and thin walls.\nShe also suggests you be discerning of moving components as these are the first to be worn down. A steel-rod hinge lasts longer than a standard plastic pin hinge. If your cooler has wheels, you want to ensure that the housing and axles are sturdy. Nylon rope handles are also more durable and more weather-resistant than plastic ones.\nThe Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee certifies products that are bear-resistant, so if you\u2019re camping in bear country or expect to encounter wildlife, look out for the IGBC certification.\nPortability\nYou\u2019re hauling food, drinks, ice packs and ice to hold you over for days and that isn\u2019t exactly light lifting, so look for portability features. Oversized wheels make hauling over rough terrain more manageable, particularly for large-capacity coolers. Comfortable, well-placed handles help you to lift the cooler in and out of a truck or hatchback. Extended rope handles let you carry a cooler with a buddy, while integrated handles that are closer in help if you\u2019re hauling solo.\nHow We Selected\nWe selected each camping cooler based on how well they performed on quick overnights and long weekend campouts, prioritizing durability, insulation, and portability. We took into consideration their individual features as well as any included extras that made using these coolers easier and identified any pain points we came across. Those that we didn\u2019t test we chose based on their promising specs, our own experience, and intel from Robbins. Our selection has options that provide for a large campsite as well as those that can accompany you on some solo ventures.\nDanny Perez is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics with a focus on men's style, gear, and home goods.

      "text": "Daypacks are smaller and more compared to true backpacking packs, which are designed to store enough supplies for multiple days outdoors. As the name suggests, daypacks hold about one day\u2019s worth of gear, so they are great for short hikes and even daily commutes.\nFor instance, a good daypack can store a pair of hiking shoes in the main compartment, your water bottle in a designated side pocket, and a laptop in the built-in internal sleeve. While most of the packs we recommend have an outdoor slant, each of them also works as an all-purpose option.\nMost daypacks offer between 15 to 25 liters of storage space which should be enough for essential gear and a few loose items without overflowing. During our latest round of testing, we also took a look at support features like padded shoulder straps, hip belts, and foam or plastic back panels. While obviously storage and utility remain the priorities, comfort and support take a solid daypack and make it the one you won\u2019t hike without.\nWe typically like daypacks that prioritize hiking and outdoor use. Most of these are also compatible for travel and everyday commuting, but packs with these as their primary use often lack the durability and technical features to be used for strenuous outdoor activities.\nAhead, these are the best daypacks our team has vetted and tested.\nThe Best Daypacks\n- Best Overall: REI Co-Op Flash 22 Daypack\n- Biggest Capacity: REI Co-Op Trail 25 Daypack\n- Most User-Friendly: Yeti Ranchero Daypack\n- Best Lightweight: Cotopaxi Batac 16 L Del Dia Pack\n- Best Straps: Helly Hansen Generator Daypack\nHow We Selected and Tested\nTo find the best daypacks, we tested multiple backpacks including the Yeti Ranchero, the Cotopaxi Batac, Helly Hansen Generator, Osprey Talon, REI Co-Op Trail and the REI Co-op Flash 22. A number of Popular Mechanics staff members tried them out using both real-world experiences and careful testing. We looked closely at storage organization, the comfort and durability of the material, support features like sternum straps and hip belts, and of course, how it actually feels to walk with one over our shoulders for long stretches of time.\nWe prioritized options with good internal organization and storage pockets. For packs that lacked ample storage pockets, we made sure they excelled in other ways that made them worth considering. For instance, the Cotopaxi Batac didn\u2019t impress us with its storage options, but stood out for its portable, roll-up design.\nWe wore them on hikes, other outdoor adventures, while commuting to work, and in our everyday lives. We also made sure to utilize every feature including pockets, support straps, and laptop and hydration sleeves.\nFor daypacks we haven\u2019t tested yet, we evaluated the capacity, weight, construction, feature set, and cost against those we did, as well as each other. We researched the market, read through hundreds of customer reviews, and relied on our own gear-testing expertise.\nFull Reviews\nThe REI Co-op Flash 22 has everything you need and nothing you don\u2019t. It offers enough space for a day\u2019s essential with room to spare, ideal for storing your phone, keys, and any medicine, along with lunch and maybe a fleece, plus a place for a drink and the items you tend to grab the most, like sunglasses and sunscreen.\nIt\u2019s lightweight at just over a pound, and provides enough support through the hip belt and sternum strap to keep you comfortable even when the 22-liter capacity is close to full. While we could have used a bit more padding on the shoulder straps, it was sufficient enough.\nDaypacks are often designed with hydration sleeves, which some people prefer, though we appreciated the Flash\u2019s two stretchy side pockets for a good old-fashioned water bottle or two.\nPriced at a reasonable $60, it\u2019s tough to beat the value that this daypack delivers.\nFull REI Co-op Flash 22 Daypack Review\nAt 25 liters, the Trail is the largest daypack we recommend and one of the most fully featured. Beyond 25 liters and the size of the pack becomes more cumbersome and less portable. This could slow you down or make it a less convenient travel companion. However, at 25, the Trail rides the line perfectly.\nIts ample size includes a hydration sleeve large enough to fit a 3-liter reservoir, which is double the size that many similar options can fit, and the hydration port sits near the right shoulder instead of at the base of the neck. This allows you to take out and refill the pack without taking off the entire item.\nThe Trail boasts six pockets, including a small front compartment with a soft lining for holding your sunglasses or phone. Another feature we love in the Trail that not many packs come with is a rain cover that protects your items should the weather turn. The cover is stored in a small pouch at the bottom of the daypack and wraps around the exterior similarly to a fitted sheet on a mattress.\nFor bulkier items, there are two sections of daisy chain loops on the front and two sets of metal fobs designed specifically for holding trekking poles.\nThe hip belt isn\u2019t padded and doesn\u2019t have pockets, but if you need near-immediate access to small gear, you can attach REI\u2019s Trail 2 waistpack. Plush cushioning on the back panel and shoulder straps adds comfort, and the sternum strap is easily adjustable. And the eco-conscious will appreciate that the Trail is made entirely with recycled nylon that\u2019s burly enough to stand up to abuse.\nIf you\u2019ve got a bit of extra cash to spend on your daypack, the Yeti Ranchero is hard to turn down. The most striking feature about it is the Y-format of the zippers: two run from the top corners to the pack\u2019s center line, where a third that runs top to bottom meets them. I loved this design when using it for weekend trips. With the interior completely filled up, I didn\u2019t have to rifle my hand through the entire pack just to reach some clean underwear. At the same time, if I just wanted to grab my book, I only opened the top lid.\nThe daypack also has a top pocket specifically designed for valuables that opens from the outside. This is great for making items like your phone or wallet easily accessible while also out of your pockets or hands. The pocket even comes with a small latch for hooking your keys on.\nThe internal storage has few side pockets as well as two sleeves which we found worked well for water bottles and small umbrellas. I appreciated that there\u2019s also two laptop sleeves for storing computers, tablets, or even just a notebook. I use both sleeves nearly every single day, storing my laptop in the first one and book in the second. This also leaves me more space in the main storage area for loose items like my lunch, a pair of sneakers, or a change of clothes.\nThe daypack\u2019s material is a tough nylon blend designed specifically to prevent snags or tears. After scraping it against branches and rocks, the exterior of the daypack had no visible marks. The material is also water resistant which should keep your items safe in the rain, though we don\u2019t recommend walking through deep water or submerging it.\nOne thing to note is its weight. At over 3 pounds, this is the heaviest option we recommend. The heft isn\u2019t noticeable right away, but I did begin to feel it after a few miles of walking with a fully loaded storage compartment. The padded shoulder straps and hard foam structure help lessen the load, but I would keep that in mind if you\u2019re looking for something to take on longer hikes.\nFull Yeti Ranchero Backpack Review\nIf you need something lightweight and portable, very few backpacks are going to offer the same versatility and durability that Cotopaxi does. The daypack is made of ripstop nylon that is both water resistant and well equipped for any environment. While most of the daypacks we recommend don\u2019t have frames, this is the only one without any structure at all.\nSo, when empty, the pack will roll up or flatten out. This makes it a great travel companion. Executive Director of Content Strategy Erica Murphy tested the Batac and said: \u201cI also love how packable it is. I can roll it up and fit it easily into a carry-on suitcase without adding much weight to my luggage. It's become a staple for me during any travel.\u201d\nHowever, this also means it will sag or shift weight uncomfortably when carrying heavy objects or when filled to the brim.\nAnother notable feature on this daypack is the zippered side pocket. The zipper sits vertically so you can easily open and close it without fully taking the Batac off. Simply, swing the backpack to the side of your body and grab what you need. This pocket is perfect for storing your smart phone or wallet, or any other item you\u2019d want quick access to throughout the day.\nIf you want secure attachment to your body without all the bulk, this daypack from Helly Hansen is worth your while. The shoulder straps and back have breathable, cushy padding. In fact, even when filled to the brim, these straps were easily the most comfortable of the backpacks that I tested. This allowed me to cinch the straps tighter without them digging into my skin.\nSimilarly the hip belt and sternum straps clipped tightly to the body without ever becoming uncomfortable. In fact, after I dialed the fit in and about 20 minutes walking in the heat, they were barely perceptible. Each hip strap also comes with zippered pockets. This was perfect for quickly storing keys, wallets, or earbuds for easy access.\nThe backpack is relatively simple in design with a main internal pocket, a hydration sleeve, and few external storage areas. It does however come with an expandable drop pocket on the front. Instead of leaving a water bottle to slosh around inside the main compartment or trying to slot it in a small elastic side sleeve, we were able to dump a large Hydro Flask in and forget about it.\nThat same bottle didn\u2019t fit in nearly any of the exterior front or side pockets in other daypacks I tested. It\u2019s important to note that the drop pocket is typically used for storing jackets or wet items to prevent them from getting items in the main compartment wet. That said, it worked great for my water bottle too.\nWhile most of the backpacks we recommend have little or no internal structure, the Talon from Osprey provides a sturdy back panel that gives the support and security of larger full-size backpacks without the added weight of metal structure. Instead, the more understated panel is made of plastic and foam, and so significantly lighter than its steel counterparts.\nThe panels are also designed with breathability in mind. There are foam ridges that provide open pathways for airflow with a mesh exterior of the backpack allowing for easy cooling. I definitely noticed when wearing the Talon in the heat. Even under direct sunlight, the ridge design kept my shirt from soaking through with sweat (like it normally would).\nAt the same time, this breathability didn\u2019t take away from the security and structure the panel provides, and it offers a level of support that most of the unstructured backpacks do not. This made it easier for me to carry heavy or oblong items without feeling the weight as greatly on my back.\nThe Talon, perhaps more than any other option here, is built for outdoor activities. Alongside classic storage pockets and solid internal organization, there are plenty of tailored spots for gear. For instance, the daypack comes with a loop for an ice axe, a helmet clip, a loop for sunglasses, a plastic-sheathed rack for climbing gear and carabiners, and, yes, attachment points for trekking poles.\nWhat to Consider\nBackpack Fit\nAnother key to finding a comfortable backpack is to choose one that fits. Pack fit is largely determined by torso length (measured from your bony C7 vertebra at the base of your neck to your iliac crest at the top of your hip bones), but it can also include the overall shape of the bag. Unfortunately, most daypacks are only available in one torso size, but a select few, like the REI Co-Op Trail, have multiple options. Even if you can\u2019t select a torso length, choosing a men\u2019s or women\u2019s specific size can help.\nCapacity and Storage Pockets\nChoose a bag under 15 liters if you are carrying food and water for yourself, along with a first aid kit and your personal effects.\nBut if you need to bring rain gear or extra layers for high-altitude hiking, opt for a 20- to 25-liter pack. This larger size is also ideal if you regularly haul binoculars or a DSLR camera, will be carrying gear and food for others, or want room to stash a book, hammock, or packable blanket for a mid-hike picnic.\nWe typically prefer packs closer to 20 liters than 15 with all but one of our recommendations are 20 liters or above. The space allows you to carry extra snacks, gear, or water without reaching capacity. While you can get by on bare essentials, we like the extra preparedness a slightly larger daypack provides.\nDurability and Extra Features\nLastly, don\u2019t forget to evaluate the features of a pack. Exterior gear loops for attaching bulky gear and hydration sleeves for storing a water reservoir are fairly standard, though the internal storage pocket layout is different nearly across the board.\nOptions like the Yeti Ranchero have two laptop sleeves, two internal pockets, and a top pouch to separate all your items into different compartments and leave the main storage area for larger items like a water bottle or extra pair of shoes. The Cotopaxi Batac on the other hand has very few internal storage pockets and uses this simple design to maximize space in the main compartment.\nThe addition of a hip belt will help stabilize the backpack against your body and transfer some of the load to your legs. This allows for more efficient hiking and reduces the strain on your shoulders and upper back. If you live somewhere rainy like the Pacific Northwest, a waterproof option or one that comes with a rain cover will protect your valuables.\nWhen To Choose a Frameless Design\nMany hiking packs meant for daily use have a lightweight frameless construction. That industry lingo can be a bit misleading because most still have some built-in support, usually in the form of a foam back panel (also called a framesheet). This panel gives the bag shape, helps distribute the load, and protects you from getting jabbed by any gear inside. By design, frameless packs rest next to the body, which can lead to a sweaty situation especially on warm days. To improve back ventilation, companies reduce the contact surface by designing foam panels with raised portions or cutouts.\nInternal frame packs are built for carrying heavier loads and designed to distribute weight across the body. This construction is ideal for backpacking trips, but there are some smaller day hiking models made with curved metal rods installed along the perimeter of the pack\u2019s back. Like on frameless designs, the back panel can be made of foam, or it can be a piece of mesh fabric that\u2019s stretched across the rods. This tensioned design offers good ventilation because there is space between the backpack and the mesh panel.\nFor most day hikers, a frameless pack is a fine choice. Because these use less material than internal frame options, they\u2019re lighter and generally cheaper. Because of this, almost every daypack we recommend lacks a metal frame.\nHowever, if you\u2019re the designated mule for your crew or just tend to bring a lot on the trail, you will probably be more comfortable using a small internal frame pack.\nTom Price is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics and Runner's World while also contributing to Best Products and Bicycling.

      "text": "Most camp chairs fall into one of two categories: full-size models that collapse down into one piece, and smaller chairs with snap-together frames and a separate seat to attach. The latter is often smaller and more portable, with a low back and emphasis on packability. I was looking for a combination of the two and eventually landed on REI Co-op\u2019s Flexlite Camp Dreamer Chair.\nThis chair perfectly blends the two styles, with a tall back, reclined angle, and collapsible frame that breaks down into three pieces for easy storage. I\u2019ve had the REI Flexlite for four years, and the design, comfort, packability, and stability are just a few reasons why it\u2019s my favorite.\nHow I Tested the REI Co-op Flexlite Camp Dreamer\nI\u2019ve had some version of this chair for the past four years, and have brought it with me on countless road trips and camping trips. I\u2019ve used it as a perch for changing into camp shoes, for reading around a fire, and for hours working on my laptop. This chair is comfortable, stable, and easy to get in and out of. Needless to say, I know my way around this chair pretty well.\nIt's comfortable and portable, but you lose the armrests.\nThis chair\u2019s angle is just right for lounging and working, and the 27-inch back is quite supportive, with a deep seat. I am 5\u20196\u201d, and the top of the seat is almost exactly the same height as my head. The edge of the seat hits about one-quarter of the way down my legs so it doesn't cut off circulation and it\u2019s more than 12 inches off the ground, so getting in and out isn\u2019t a challenge.\nThe Dreamer weighs roughly three pounds, and folds down to 7 x 22 inches, so it isn\u2019t as portable as other REI chairs like the standard Flexlite, which folds down to 4.5 x 15 inches and weighs less than two pounds. However, it\u2019s more portable than REI\u2019s single-piece Campwell, which weighs eight pounds, and folds down to 7 x 33 inches. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Flexlite Camp Dreamer has a 300-pound weight capacity, where most smaller chairs, like the standard Flexlite, max out around 200 pounds.\nSince this chair does collapse down without armrests, the cup holders are a little underwhelming\u2014I find them too narrow and tipsy to support a tall bottle or open cup. So while I wouldn\u2019t put an open coffee mug in there, I personally don\u2019t miss the armrests. Besides, the tall sides of the chair feel almost hammock-like, which I enjoy.\nDespite the center-bar design, the chair feels stable.\nWhile many folding chairs, like REI\u2019s Campwell Chair, have a foot at each corner secured diagonally to the chair\u2019s base, the Flexlite Camp Dreamer has a single front-to-back center bar with four legs extending from the middle. This design is inherently less stable than a chair anchored at each corner, but the Flexlite Camp Dreamer feels better than other chairs with this design.\nThis stability comes primarily from the Flexlite\u2019s positioning, which keeps your butt slightly forward while the seat back reclines to balance your center of gravity. It also has rubber tips attached to each foot, which helps with ground contact. If you\u2019re looking for a more stable option for bumpy ground, I\u2019d go with a corner-based folding chair, but I\u2019ve never had a problem with the Dreamer\u2019s stability.\nThe materials and durability are impressive.\nI\u2019ve had one version of the Flexlite Camp Dreamer for four years and seen almost no wear and tear. The chair body is made with a thick 300-denier ripstop polyester, and the legs are a lightweight, tough aluminum. The shock cords that snap the legs together are often common failure points on other chairs, but I\u2019ve had no issues with the elastic on the Flexlite Camp Dreamer.\nMoreover, I\u2019ve seen no difference in quality or comfort in the REI compared to more expensive name brands, and I really appreciate how affordable it is. To give an example, the Helinox Sunset Chair has a similar height, build, materials, and design, but costs $70 more. While this is likely due to the Sunset\u2019s slightly larger build and weight capacity, it\u2019s hard to justify paying that much more when the Flexlite Camp Dreamer does everything at a fraction of the cost.\nIt takes more effort to assemble it than other one-piece folding chairs.\nThis chair isn\u2019t hard to assemble, but it\u2019s a few more steps more than unfolding a collapsible camp chair. The Flexlite comes in a carry case, which includes the leg system, chair body, and headrest pillow.\nTo assemble it, you need to snap together each of the four legs to the center bar, then arrange the back support poles, which are connected via elastic shock cords and must be positioned into plastic attachment points. The seat material stretches over the frame, and you can attach the little pillow to the hooks on the top of the seat.\nIt takes about two minutes to assemble, which isn\u2019t bad, but I do wish it were just a little simpler. However, as long as you fold the chair material carefully, and make sure the legs are as compact as possible, it fits nicely into its case for travel or storage.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe REI Flexlite Camp Dreamer is the most comfortable camp chair I\u2019ve tested. It's roughly half the weight of a standard folding camp chair, but offers more support than minimalist, low-back camp chairs. I am continually impressed by the durability of the material and the longevity of the two models I\u2019ve tested.\nYou'll make a few minor sacrifices in stability with the front-to-back support bar, but it\u2019s more stable than other chairs with this design. And as long as you have a nearby table or don\u2019t mind putting an open cup on the ground, most people won\u2019t miss the structured cup holders. And, if you're like me, you'll forgo having armrests for the comfort of its hammock-like seat.\nOther Camp Chairs We've Tested and Recommend\nMaggie Slepian is a full-time freelance writer in the outdoor industry and has tested gear professionally for almost ten years\u2014she is an avid backpacker, trail runner, bikepacker, and horseback rider and has thru-hiked thousands of miles on the Appalachian, Colorado, and Ouachita trails, along with backcountry travel on terrain including coastal trails, the desert, and high alpine peaks.

Sure, you could rough it on a log or sit at a hard picnic table, but with so many affordable, reliable, and most of all, comfortable camp chairs available, why would you?\nCamp chairs are a relatively broad category of products, encompassing everything from stool-style chairs that can be carried in one hand to luxurious two-person loveseats with thick, cushioned seats. A good camping chair, regardless of design, should at the very least be comfortable enough to sit in for a meal or an evening by the campfire. Most have light cushioning or a stretchy material that cradles your body and keeps you from spending all night in discomfort.\nTo help you narrow your search, we tested and researched a selection of outdoor seating options, from ultralight camp chairs and plush recliners to two-seaters and swings. Read on for the best camping chairs we recommend, along with what to consider before buying.\nThe Best Camp Chairs\n- Best Overall: Yeti Trailhead Collapsible Camp Chair\n- Best Value: REI Co-op Wonderland Chair\n- Best Rocker: GCI Outdoor Kickback Rocker\n- Best for Lounging: Kelty Deluxe Lounge Chair\n- Best Budget Pick: Coleman Chair with Built-In Cooler\nWhat to Consider\nHow We Selected and Tested\nFor this update, we tested the Yeti Trailhead Collapsible Camp Chair, the REI Co-op Wonderland Chair, evaluating each on its weight, stability, comfort, ease of setup, and durability. (While we\u2019ve recommended the Trippy Outdoors Dreamer in the past, we don\u2019t anymore given that its plank-style seat is too wobbly. The options below are better.)\nWe spent time carrying the camp chairs through a park, taking note of how heavy they felt and whether they were cumbersome to transport up small hills and over boulders. After setting them up on grass and dirt patches to see how they balanced on uneven terrain, we took a seat, judging each by its relative comfort. It\u2019s worth noting that our testers spanned a range of heights and body weights so we could get a variety of impressions.\nOther camp chairs chairs we\u2019ve tested in the past\u2014including the Kelty Deluxe Lounge Chair, GCI Outdoor Kickback Rocker, and Sunnyfeel Camping Directors Chair\u2014have stood the test of time and still rank among the best. We are also in the process of testing out the Helinox Chair One (re) and the Zempire Rocco Loungers V2. Once fully tested, we will update this list with our findings.\nFor the camp chairs we did not test ourselves, we relied heavily on our research into the specs, design, and materials within the context of our previous hands-on experience with the other chairs to know what to prioritize. We also took into account online reviews from past buyers and compared them directly to the chairs we tested out ourselves.\nIn finalizing our list, alongside our evaluations of quality, we also made sure to keep price in mind.\nThe Best Camp Chairs, Reviewed\nYeti\u2019s Trailhead camping chair immediately stood out for its comfort. It is made with a flexible, durable fabric that\u2019s spread tight against the frame, with a weight limit of 500 pounds\u2014the highest of any folding chair we tested. Despite its strength, the material wasn\u2019t overly stiff either. There was enough give in the material to cradle our legs and back, balancing out the support with softness. In fact, even without sewn-in cushioning, we still found this to be one of the most comfortable.\nBeyond the seat comfort, we were impressed by the sturdiness of the frame. It\u2019s made of alloy steel, and held up against scratches, heavier body weights, and exposure to sun and water. We also appreciated its locking mechanism. While it takes some effort to put into place, it allows you to shift around and even set it up on uneven ground without risk of it tipping while you lounge.\nAt more than 13 pounds, the Yeti camp chair may be too heavy for some if there\u2019s a long trek to camp, though its carrying case has backpack straps that are comfortable to wear, plus it keeps your arms free. Even on a walk of just around 10 to 15 minutes, we did feel its weight. It also doesn\u2019t come cheap\u2014it\u2019s the most expensive camp chair we tested\u2014and we wish it came in more than a couple colors, like the brand\u2019s awesome selection of coolers.\nFor a classic fold-up camp chair, the REI Co-op Wonderland offers a great mix of comfort and durability. It has a slightly wider seat and back\u2014noticeable from the moment you sit down\u2014made of woven recycled polyester with a water-repellant coating. After pouring water directly onto the cushion, we simply wiped it off with our hands and it was dry enough to sit back down immediately. Its steel-tube frame felt sturdy on grass and dirt, and it has an average 300-pound weight limit.\nWe also found that the wooden arms were markedly more comfortable against the skin than the textured plastic armrests on other chairs we tested. They were smoother, and from an aesthetic standpoint, gave a far more old-school look to the chair. The REI camp chair also has an integrated cup holder that\u2019s attached to the metal frame, set off to the side.\nLike the Yeti camp chair, it\u2019s more than 13 pounds, likely too heavy to take on a hike. But it does feature an adjustable carrying strap for quick walks to campgrounds or to your beach blanket.\nWhat sets the Helinox Chair One (re) apart from other options is how compactly it packs down. Like previous models, the newest version of this ultralight chair features tubing that disassembles similar to tent poles, so it fits inside a mid-sized backpack with room to spare. Along with its economical size, it's also the lightest chair we recommend by several pounds. That makes it a good choice for outdoor hikes and backpacking trips.\nDuring testing, I carried the chair in its carrying pouch for close to half a mile on mixed terrain. Unlike some other options I tested, the Chair One (re) caused no strain at all.\nThat said, most other chair were also ready to go the second I got to my destination. This camp chair must be set up. I had to lock the frame poles in place and stretch the cover over four different holding points. This took less than five minutes which isn't much time, but is certainly more than other models.\nDespite the small size, I actually found the chair incredibly comfortable. The design naturally provides a bit of recline and I was able to relax in it with ease. The material also offered a bit of give on the sides, which molded to my body.\nGCI has staked its claim as the king of camp comfort with its Rocker line of chairs, and the Kickback is our current favorite. Pistons on the back legs help with the rocking motion, and we found the resistance stiff enough that we wouldn\u2019t accidentally tip the chair over backward\u2014but not so aggressive that it felt like the Kickback was pitching us forward.\nBoth our 6-foot-2 and 5-foot-5 testers liked the seat height and had no problems sitting down and standing up. We also liked that it has the usual cup holder and phone pocket on the armrests.\nDespite that it\u2019s a little unwieldy when carried over the shoulder, the strap didn\u2019t dig in, though we\u2019d still recommend using it for light activities such as car camping, backyard hangs, and picnics.\nSome padding in the seat and backrest would be nice, but the fabric has some slack that makes it comfortable to sit in. Plus, the rocker design provides an angle that takes you off your knees and feet.\nAnother favorite among our testers, this camping chair has a broad seat that doesn\u2019t pinch or press into your hamstrings, shoulders, or hips. The steel supports are thick and the feet are widely spaced, so it felt sturdy and secure to sit in. Our testers were able to recline back and lounge at just about any angle without fear of the chair tipping over. The adjustable cup holders can accommodate drinks from a regular can of soda to a beer growler (yes, you can have up to 64 ounces of beer in your cup holder).\nIt\u2019s so comfortable that one tester remarked, \u201cMy wife, who is six months pregnant, was happy to spend half a day at a bike race as long as she got to use the chair.\u201d\nThat La-Z-Boy level of comfort makes this an excellent option for car camping and RV use, though don\u2019t expect this to be a go-to option if you\u2019re carrying your gear on your back or in your hands.\nThe fewer things you have to lug to your campsite, the better. Thanks to this affordable camp chair\u2019s built-in insulated, four-can cooler, you can leave the kombuchas in the heavy cooler in the shade while you stash a few beer cans and a handful of ice in your chair.\nCooler aside, we also like this Coleman chair\u2019s side pocket and cushioned backrest. The side pocket is big enough for books or tablets and has two mesh sections on the front for smaller items like bottle caps, keys, or a phone.\nIt has an above-average 325-pound weight limit, and while it isn\u2019t the lightest camp chair on our list, we found its 8.5 pounds reasonable to transport, especially considering the attachments.\nThe flatpack style of this camping chair doesn\u2019t lend itself well to extreme portability, but makes it a must for stretching out after a long day in the great outdoors. If you\u2019re mostly car camping out of your truck or driving to a friend\u2019s BBQ, you\u2019ll love the extra size and support these chairs offer.\nThe zero-gravity chair reclines nearly flat if you\u2019d rather stare at the clouds than at your fellow campers. You can also lock it into position, preventing unexpected tips or weight shifts. The extended reclining position is long enough for tall users, and sturdy enough to hold up to 300 pounds.\nOur testers didn\u2019t have any ongoing gripes with this chair, though one complained of feeling a crossbar under the seat. The chair distributes weight quite well, and we never felt off-balance while reclining. However, we did find it quite awkward to get out of the chair while reclined, so be sure to put it back into the upright position before getting up.\nTom Price is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics and Runner's World while also contributing to Best Products and Bicycling.

      "text": "The 9 Best EDC Essentials for Camping, Hiking, and Daily Tasks\nWe tried out multitools, keychains, and other gear for everyday carry. Here\u2019s what we recommend.\nGear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nEDC essentials\u2014or everyday carry essentials, for the uninitiated\u2014are just that: the things you keep on your person that make your life a bit easier. Everyday carry essentials don\u2019t have to be overly tactical, as most of our day-to-day lives don\u2019t include going full Rambo. There are a handful of tools and gadgets that help you better tackle those daily tasks without fumbling through your toolbox or kitchen drawers.\nWhether it\u2019s a small knife to open a box or a reliable pen and pad to jot down a note, these EDC essentials fit into your daily life and provide some welcome convenience without weighing you down.\nThe Best EDC Essentials We Recommend\n- Best Multitool: Leatherman Signal Multi Tool\n- Best Key Rings: The James Brand Titanium Key Ring\n- Best Pocket Knife: Leatherman Free K2 EDC Knife\n- Best Pocket Notebook: Field Notes Pitch Black Memo Pocket Notebooks\n- Best Wallet: Ekster Parliament RFID-Blocking Wallet\nWhat are you missing?\nYou don\u2019t have to have a full EDC kit ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice. Instead, think about times when you had to borrow a tool or didn\u2019t have quick access to a useful item you needed. Take a look at where you typically carry your most-used tools and gadgets\u2014pockets, key rings, belt loops\u2014and consider what you could add to your arsenal that would make your daily life easier.\nMany brands make carabiner-style key rings with added features like a bottle-opener or flashlight, and many pocket knives have some sort of extra tool included that fits within their casing. The benefit of many EDC essentials we recommend is that they condense multiple tools into a single, compact item. We even include a portable charger to keep your devices going all day long.\nMake sure it fits\nThe whole point of EDC essentials is to make your life easier, so you don\u2019t want any items where the cumbersome nature of carrying them ultimately outweighs the convenience they provide. No matter their use, you should be able to carry any EDC item on your person without discomfort.\nThe items we recommend have a maximum length of 5.5 inches, ensuring they easily fit in a pocket or bag. If the EDC item you\u2019re eyeing includes a knife, check your local and state laws to ensure that the included blade is legal to carry before you make your purchase.\nMinimalist form, maximum function\nSomething meant to be carried daily needs to be durable\u2014that\u2019s why lots of EDC items are made from low-maintenance materials. Many manufacturers use the most durable materials and employ wear-resistant finishes, such as anodized aluminum, stainless steel, and brass.\nWhile the materials and design of most EDC essentials prioritize functionality, the style of a lot of these tools leans minimalist, so you won\u2019t look like you\u2019re going straight from the office to the campsite.\nHow We Tested and Selected\nTo bring you the best EDC essentials on the market, we thought about the EDC tools we use to make our lives easier daily. We polled our editors around the office to see which items were amongst our favorites and discussed how they\u2019ve held up over time, where they really shine, and if they\u2019ve let us down. Our final list is a comprehensive guide to the best item in each category. While EDC varies from person to person\u2014that\u2019s the fun of it, after all\u2014we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll find something here to add to or improve your everyday carry.\nDanny Perez is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics with a focus on men's style, gear, and home goods.
