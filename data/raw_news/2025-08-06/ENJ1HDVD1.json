  "title": "GREGG JARRETT: Who could be indicted by a grand jury in the Russia collusion hoax?",
  "description": "Grand jury examines evidence against Obama administration officials and Hillary Clinton campaign over alleged conspiracy to frame Trump in Russia collusion hoax.",
  "content": "Behind every sordid conspiracy, there\u2019s a story waiting to be told. But sometimes the truth is hidden so deep that it takes years to fully unravel. It\u2019s been nearly a decade since President Donald Trump became the victim of the greatest mass delusion in American political history. Those who abused the levers of government power and schemed to frame him are now suffering an acute case of the legal jitters.Those behind the infamous Russia Hoax have reason to be nervous. On Monday, the news broke that the Department of Justice is convening a grand jury to assess a growing body of incriminating evidence. Indictments may follow.  JONATHAN TURLEY: DEMOCRATS PULLED THE GREATEST POLITICAL CON JOB EVER ON AMERICANS. IT'S FINALLY UNRAVELINGThere was never a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy. But there was an elaborate conspiracy to falsely accuse him of collusion.  It becomes criminal if it can be shown that people lied under oath, deceived government agencies, manufactured false documents, or if federal officials themselves violated rights and laws with the intent to persecute and/or prosecute an innocent person.  The Most Obvious TargetsIn 2016, John Brennan, James Comey, and James Clapper were directors of the CIA, FBI, and ODNI, respectively, in the Obama administration. They played pivotal roles in the corrupt investigation of Trump dubbed \"Crossfire Hurricane.\" There was no credible evidence to justify the dilating and damaging probe.  Just the opposite. They knew at the outset that the collusion narrative was a dirty political trick conjured up by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to smear her political opponent and to distract from her own email scandal in which she had clearly committed crimes.  Evidence shows that the CIA chief rushed to the White House to alert then-President Obama. In two successive meetings on July 28 and August 3, 2016, Brennan briefed Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Comey and Clapper. Brennan\u2019s handwritten notes recounted Clinton\u2019s plot \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"  Instead of telling the truth to the American people and Congress, Obama and his confederates concealed Hillary\u2019s scheme. Armed with the bogus dossier secretly funded by Clinton\u2019s campaign, they exploited it as a pretext to implicate Trump as a Russian asset, knowing full well that he was not.Despite planned leaks to the media, Trump won. There was no election interference by the Russians and certainly no collusion. But that did not stop Obama, Biden and his national security team from peddling the canard to destroy Trump once he took office. To do so, they had to recast the evidence.A December 7, 2016, intelligence report stated, \"We assess that foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the U.S. Presidential outcome this year.\" The report added, \"We have no evidence of cyber manipulation of election infrastructure intended to alter results.\"  But that conclusion did not conform to the spurious collusion narrative. So, two days later Obama ordered a new Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) that peddled the lie that \"Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump\" and \"aspired to help\" his election chances. That document appears to have been cleverly rigged by Brennan, Comey and Clapper.  In their testimony before Congress, they insisted that the dossier played no role in the assessment, offering up a sanitized version that deliberately deleted any reference to it. The newly declassified documents expose the erasure and prove that the dossier was, indeed, referenced in the body of the ICA and misused to reach the contrived conclusion that Russia helped Trump win.Separately, a compelling case can be made that Comey deceived FISA court judges in obtaining three surveillance warrants to spy on Trump campaign associate, Carter Page. Comey vouched for the credibility of the debunked dossier and attested to the reliability of its author, Christopher Steele, without disclosing that he\u2019d been fired as an FBI source for lying.       Lying under oath in any federal proceeding constitutes perjury (18 USC 1621). Knowingly making a false or fraudulent statement not under oath is also a crime (18 USC 1001). Both carry punishments of up to five years in prison. Conspiracy to commit perjury or to provide false statements, as well as conspiring to intentionally submitting fraudulent or deceptive documents, would constitute additional crimes (18 USC 371) with the same penalties. In a conspiracy the statute of limitations begins when the last overt act is committed or when purposely concealed evidence is discovered \u2014which is fairly recent.  Clinton and her CampaignIn any conspiracy case before the grand jury, the conduct of Hillary Clinton would have to be examined closely. After all, the genesis of the collusion hoax occurred when, according to documents, she approved the scheme on July 26, 2016. She was instrumental in propagating it.  But Clinton did not act alone. Those running her campaign can expect to receive grand jury subpoenas to cough up documents and offer testimony. Those would include campaign manager Robby Mook, chairman John Podesta, communications director Jennifer Palmieri, general counsel Marc Elias, and policy advisers Jake Sullivan and Julianne Smith.  According to the newly declassified report from special counsel John Durham, it was Smith who proposed the fictitious collusion scheme to Hillary. The adviser told his investigators that she \"did not specifically remember proposing a plan to Clinton\"\u2026 but \"it was possible.\" (Page 14, Durham Annex)Also implicated in the Durham report is Leonard Bernardo, a top official at George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations. Although he denies writing any of the incriminating emails confirming Clinton\u2019s approval of the plot to demonize Trump, you can add his name to the list of witnesses.There is significant evidence that some, if not all, of Hillary\u2019s senior campaign team helped formulate and spread the Russia Hoax. They posited that Trump conspired with Vladimir Putin in the bowels of the Kremlin to steal the election. With every new leak, the Trump-hating media became witting accessories.       With an eye toward criminal charges, prosecutors should consider conspiracy to defraud the government (18 USC 371), which includes interfering with lawful government functions \u2014such as an election\u2014 through false statements, fraudulent documents, and deceit.  Deprivation of rights under color of law (18 USC 242) is another underlying crime that could attach to potential conspiracy charges. The federal statute targets abuse of power by government officials and others who act to willfully deprive a person \u2014such as Trump\u2014 of his constitutional rights.     Fifth Amendment and Obama ImmunityWe can expect that some witnesses will invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to remain silent. Some may regard the grand jury proceedings as a perjury trap, while others have much to hide. But that doesn\u2019t mean that prosecutors cannot bring a viable case.There are people in the intelligence community who witnessed a myriad of corrupt acts and will be more than willing to testify about them \u2014particularly those who warned that sham evidence was being manipulated to frame Trump. Others who were more directly involved may seek immunity in exchange for their valuable testimony.  There is only one person who already enjoys immunity and that\u2019s former President Barack Obama. Thanks to the case brought by his successor, Donald Trump, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that presidents have broad immunity for their official acts, although they are not immune for actions taken outside their official capacity.  As noted above, Obama was deeply embedded in the hoax. The newly revealed records show that he pressured Comey to clear Hillary of her email crimes, joined the plot to push the phony collusion narrative that Clinton instigated, and helped engineer the counterfeit case against Trump by massaging intelligence.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONObama would surely assert that everything he did is protected as official acts. That, of course, is a debatable defense and would have to be sorted out by federal courts. But it\u2019s doubtful that prosecutors would want to venture anywhere near that treacherous legal quagmire.  In the meantime, there may be a run on criminal defense attorneys in Washington as those in legal jeopardy clamor to \"lawyer-up.\"  But that assumes that a grand jury would be seated in the nation\u2019s capital. Maybe not.  If prosecutors are crafting an overarching criminal conspiracy case that extends beyond Trump\u2019s first term to encompass the efforts by Biden\u2019s DOJ to unduly influence the 2024 election by machinating specious criminal cases against his opponent in both Washington and Florida, the latter venue could be where the grand jury convenes.  That would be logical inasmuch as DC is an utterly insane place to pursue politically charged prosecutions. Trump received a scant 6.6% of the vote there in 2024. Given the makeup of the jury pool, not to mention past experiences, gaining convictions against his perceived adversaries would be next to impossible.    Regardless of the jurisdiction, our constitutional due process guarantees that everyone is innocent until proven guilty.  Even the guilty.",

      "text": "In a blockbuster report, the CIA has belatedly exposed the rank corruption among top intelligence officials who connived to frame President Donald Trump and drive him from office during his first term.\nTheir pernicious lie was that Trump colluded with Russia to rig the 2016 presidential election in his favor. The principal piece of so-called evidence was a document known infamously as the dossier.\nIt was secretly financed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and Democrats, conceived by a foreign agent with a checkered past in espionage, and then brokered to solicitous collaborators at the FBI, CIA, the Department of Justice and the Trump-hating media.\nWHITE HOUSE WANTS OBAMA INTEL OFFICIALS 'HELD ACCOUNTABLE' FOR ROLE PEDDLING 2016 RUSSIA HOAX\nThe dossier was garbage, of course. The FBI largely debunked it before Trump was even sworn in and fired its author, Christopher Steele, for lying as a confidential human source. But the bureau concealed those inconvenient facts under then-Director James Comey and deftly exploited the document as a cudgel to bludgeon the newly elected president.\nComey was aided and abetted by others in the intelligence community, including CIA Director John Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. This malignant force of unelected officials plotted to smear Trump with what is surely the dirtiest trick in political history.\nRecently, current CIA Director John Ratcliffe declassified and released an internal agency review of the machinations that helped fuel the Russia hoax. In a statement posted on social media, Ratcliffe stated, \"All the world can now see the truth: Brennan, Clapper and Comey manipulated intelligence and silenced career professionals \u2014 all to get Trump.\"\nBRYAN DEAN WRIGHT: JOHN BRENNAN WAS MY BOSS AT THE CIA. HE BELONGS IN PRISON\nCiting previously hidden records, the review concluded that Brennan, in particular, pushed for the phony dossier to be included in the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) to catalyze a false narrative against Trump. Senior CIA experts on Russia objected but were sidelined and silenced.\nThe CIA\u2019s deputy director for analysis warned Brennan in writing that including the discredited dossier in any capacity jeopardized \"the credibility of the entire paper.\" Brennan didn\u2019t care. The fiction penned by the ex-British spy conformed to the director\u2019s preconceived fable that Trump colluded with Russia.\nThe ICA, which was ordered by President Barack Obama, was rushed to completion just days before Trump\u2019s inauguration. Brennan directed its composition and handpicked the analysts who compiled the ersatz information. To stifle dissent, 13 other key intelligence agencies were deliberately excluded. To put it bluntly, Trump was set up.\nAccording to the new CIA review, Comey and Clapper were all in on the scheme. In an interview with the New York Post, Ratcliffe said, \"This was Obama, Comey, Clapper and Brennan deciding \u2018We\u2019re going to screw Trump.\u2019\"\nThey knew the dossier was junk, which motivated them to prop it up as a reliable indictment of Trump. By incorporating it in the ICA they could leak and propagate both documents as mutual corroboration. It was a clever ruse. An illusion.\nThose of us who have long covered the bogus collusion story knew it long ago. In my 2019 book, \"Witch Hunt,\" I recounted how Brennan \"insisted that the dossier be included in the classified intelligence report,\" but then told Congress under oath that the dossier was \"not in any way used as the basis for the intelligence community\u2019s assessment.\" Clapper\u2019s testimony was nearly identical.\nHere is what I wrote in chapter 2:\n\"Brennan and Clapper were spinning a deception. A prominent colleague contradicted them and produced documents as proof that they were not telling the truth. In a classified letter to Congress, National Security Agency director Michael Rogers disclosed that the uncorroborated document (the dossier) \u2018did factor into the ICA\u2019 report. Having been caught in a falsehood, Clapper then repudiated his earlier statement. Brennan continued to deny all of it, the contrary evidence notwithstanding.\"\nCIA BEING RESTRUCTURED TO ELIMINATE 'WELL-DOCUMENTED POLITICIZATION': RATCLIFFE\nNeither Brennan nor Clapper was ever prosecuted for perjury.\nNone of that bothered news organizations. MSNBC promptly hired Brennan, while Clapper went to work for CNN. I described what they did from their media perches:\n\"The two super spooks launched an all-out attack on Trump, exploiting their new television platforms to advance the toxic fiction that the president was a secret Russian asset who had \u2018colluded\u2019 with Putin. It didn\u2019t matter to CNN that a House Intelligence Committee report determined that it had been Clapper who had leaked news of the phony dossier to the network before Trump had ever taken office.\"\nThe collusion narrative was a conspiracy itself. The collaborators knew it was a lie, but they manipulated the dossier and the ICA to peddle their fairy tale. With Hillary and her confederates, they engineered the hoax. Brennan even accused Trump of treason.\nDNI TULSI GABBARD REFERS ALLEGED INTELLIGENCE LEAKERS FOR PROSECUTION; DETAILS POSSIBLE MOTIVES\nComey also knew the dossier was spurious, as I wrote in chapter 4:\n\"He knew exactly where the dossier came from and who paid for it. He used it as the primary basis for the warrants, used it as part of the nonpublic version of the intelligence community assessment, and used it to debrief President-elect Trump so that it could be leaked to the media in January 2017.\"\nThey knew the dossier was junk, which motivated them to prop it up as a reliable indictment of Trump. By incorporating it in the ICA they could leak and propagate both documents as mutual corroboration. It was a clever ruse. An illusion.\nComey\u2019s decision to purloin and leak additional FBI documents triggered \u2014 just as he planned \u2014 the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his dilating investigation of Trump that hobbled his presidency for two years.\nOn the day that Mueller issued his report concluding that there was no evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy, the sheepish Brennan conceded, \"I don\u2019t know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThat\u2019s quite the Jekyll-Hyde metamorphosis for a guy who enthusiastically endorsed the dossier and who kept claiming that \"it was in line\" with his own CIA sources, in which he \"had great confidence.\" That, too, was a fabrication, according to the newly released CIA review.\nWhat did Comey have to say? In public, the master prevaricator dissembled and pleaded ignorance. But before Congress, he was forced to admit that some of his actions would have been different had he known then what he knows now. Not likely. He was wedded to the artifice of collusion because he despised Trump.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has vowed a reckoning. She told Fox News, \"We are digging deep to find everything that has been related to this, and I guarantee you there are some U.S. attorneys who are eager to see what we are finding \u2014 in some cases are already working their own cases to bring about that necessary accountability.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nUnless those who unscrupulously weaponized their immense power for political purposes are held to account, it will happen again. And again. The only remedy for lawlessness is justice.\nThe reckoning awaits."

      "text": "The release of declassified material has shed new light on the creation of the Russian collusion investigation and many of the names are crushingly familiar. Indeed, Congress is moving to \"round up the usual suspects\" in light of the new revelations. It is the story of the real Russian conspiracy: how high-ranking officials in the Obama Administration seeded this false claim with the help of an eager, unquestioning press corps.\nOBAMA-ERA OFFICIALS MUM ON ALLEGATIONS OF 'MANUFACTURED' INTELLIGENCE LAUNCHING TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE\nNot surprisingly, the media, which spent years repeating the false Russian collusion claims, is doing a full-court press to kill the story. Yet, many of these key figures are retaining counsel in anticipation of the unfolding investigation. Many previously secured contracts with MSNBC or CNN, or book deals, where they doubled down on the false claims detailed in these new documents. Here are just a few of the usual suspects:\nJohn Brennan, former CIA director\nBrennan is arguably the most at risk in the new disclosures, which appear to contradict his prior testimony before Congress. On May 23, 2017, Brennan testified that the infamous Steele dossier \"wasn\u2019t part of the corpus of intelligence information that we had. It was not in any way used as a basis for the Intelligence Community Assessment that was done.\"\nHowever, the new material shows that Brennan was the key figure insisting on the inclusion of the Steele dossier in an intelligence assessment, suggesting that the Russians did influence the election in favor of Trump.\nBrennan not only intervened to include the dossier but overruled the CIA\u2019s two most senior Russia experts, who said it \"did not meet even the most basic tradecraft standards.\" One analyst recounted how \"[Brennan] refused to remove it, and when confronted with the dossier\u2019s main flaws, responded, \u2018Yes, but doesn\u2019t it ring true?\u2019\"\nNotably, it was Brennan who briefed Obama in 2016 about Hillary Clinton's plan to create a Russian conspiracy \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\" Months later, it would be Brennan who actively incorporated the dossier secretly funded by Clinton's campaign.\nJames Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence\nJames Clapper, former DNI under Obama, is expecting the worst and said that he has \"lawyered up.\" Clapper was in the briefing in July 2016 when Obama was told that Clinton was planning to create a Russian conspiracy narrative. In November 2016, Clapper received an assessment from the intelligence community that Russia was \"probably not trying \u2026 to influence the election by using cyber means.\" He also received talking points from staff on Dec. 7, 2016, \"Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.\"\nOn Dec. 9, 2016, another report stated that \"Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent U.S. election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure.\" That Presidential Daily Brief was scheduled to be published on Dec. 9, but CDNI Clapper\u2019s office stopped its publication \"based on some new guidance.\"\nClapper later joined Obama with Brennan, Susan Rice, John Kerry, Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe and others, in a meeting where a new assessment was ordered that would detail the \"tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election.\" Brennan then reportedly handpicked the analysts who seemed to flip the earlier assessments without any credible intelligence.\nIn a 2018 interview with the Harvard Gazette, Clapper continued to spread the false narrative, referring to the high-confidence judgment that \"Putin directly ordered the hacking and election interference.\" He added, \"I think they [Russians] actually influenced the outcome.\"\nClapper later added to his tarnished legacy by signing the letter with more than 50 former intelligence officials dismissing the Hunter Biden laptop story before the 2020 presidential election as having the [hall]marks of \"Russian disinformation.\"\nJames Comey, former FBI director\nJames Comey would use this contrived intelligence to green-light the investigations that overwhelmed the first Trump term. The FBI was aware early that the Steele dossier was an unreliable political hit job funded by the Clinton campaign. Moreover, the CIA told the FBI that Trump associate Carter Page was a U.S. intelligence asset, not a Russian spy. The FBI ignored such countervailing intelligence, violated protocols, and lied to a federal court to maintain the Russian investigation.\nIn an interview with Fox's Bret Baier, Comey was asked about the lack of evidence of \"Russian collusion.\" Comey dismissed the question by saying \"collusion's not a word that I'm familiar with.\" Putting aside the lunacy of that statement, Comey then says the question is whether Americans were \"in cahoots with the foreign intelligence activities.\" It appears \"cahoots\" is a word he is familiar with. He then denied knowing, in April 2018, that the Clinton campaign had funded the report. Comey routinely seems unfamiliar with terms or facts that contradicted his investigating Trump, even years later.\nComey repeatedly testified to a lack of memory on key decisions made in the Russian investigation. However, documents show that it was Comey who pushed back on a planned statement by Clapper, stating that they had not determined the dossier to be reliable.\nAndrew McCabe, former acting FBI director\nAndrew McCabe, now a CNN contributor, was fired after career Justice Department officials found that the former acting FBI director not only lied to investigators but deserved to be fired. That recommendation was reportedly embraced by the career officials in the inspector general\u2019s office. He was accused of lying four times, including twice under oath.\nNot surprisingly, McCabe makes appearances in the new disclosures. He is not only present at critical meetings, but it also appears that McCabe was allegedly responsible for blocking congressional investigators from interviewing the FBI analysts who supported Brennan and drafters of the controversial ICA. Congress alleged that at least 30 FBI employees associated with the dossier were walled off by McCabe.\nThese and other names are not new. As the media was spreading the false narrative of Russian collusion, many of these figures knew that there was no evidence of such collusion. They said nothing.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nInstead, after Obama ordered a new assessment effectively flipping the conclusions of the earlier assessment, anonymous sources leaked the false narrative to the media, which eagerly ran with the story.\nWhile leaks of the false narrative were rampant, none of the actual facts were leaked to the media. In the meantime, figures like then Rep. Adam Schiff, now a Democratic senator from California, continued to claim, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller rejected evidence of collusion, that he had secret evidence to the contrary in the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff never revealed that evidence, and the public now knows that the intelligence community rejected the collusion claims from the outset.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe public is now learning about the real Russian conspiracy and its key players. It was the most infamous -- and successful -- political hit job in history. The same media that pushed the false claims are now, again, imposing a news blackout as they did with the Hunter Biden laptop. The problem is that the truth, like water, tends to find a way out. That trickle just turned into a flood for the architects of the Russian collusion hoax."

      "text": "Former President Obama is now \"squarely\" in the crosshairs of the Russiagate \"scam,\" journalist Matt Taibbi wrote in a Racket News piece on Saturday, shortly after DNI Tulsi Gabbard's office unleashed a blitz of documents and a memo said to detail the origins of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.\nTaibbi quoted an unnamed source in describing Obama as no longer being a \"tertiary\" character in the \"scam\" that followed President Trump's 2016 election win over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nHe elaborated on the remark Monday on \"America's Newsroom.\"\n\"The last major revelation that came out was that John Brennan and James Comey were the focus of criminal investigations that had been opened by the Justice Department, but these new documents that were released by Tulsi Gabbard\u2026 make it clear that the investigation is now aimed at the Obama White House and, in particular, at Barack Obama, because of decisions that were made in early December 2016 to suppress the presidential daily briefing and go ahead and order a new intelligence community assessment that ultimately would have much more aggressive conclusions about Trump and Russia,\" he told co-host Bill Hemmer.\nLast Friday, Gabbard declassified documents which she says implicate the former president and members of his national security team who \"manufactured and politicized intelligence\" to create the narrative that Russia was attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election \u2014 despite information from the intelligence community stating otherwise.\nA declassified copy of the Dec. 8, 2016 presidential daily brief for President Obama obtained by Fox News Digital reads, in part, \"We assess that Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent U.S. election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure.\"\nIt continues: \"Russian government-affiliated actors most likely compromised an Illinois voter registration database and unsuccessfully attempted the same in other states.\"\nA bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation later found that, while Trump may not have accepted Russian help, Russia did meddle in some fashion.\nThe chairman of the Intel Committee at the time \u2014 then-Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who now serves as the top diplomat to the United States under Trump \u2014 put out a statement that said, \"The committee found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election. What the committee did find, however, is very troubling. We found irrefutable evidence of Russian meddling.\"\nTaibbi said he has heard frequent complaints that the information released by Gabbard had not come out sooner.\n\"A former high-ranking Trump official said [to me] there was, 'So much corruption in the last Trump presidency that this shouldn't have been overlooked, that these documents should have come out,' but the overall sense I get is that everyone's happy that they finally are coming out, and they're looking forward to what is likely to come out this week,\" he said.\nThough Obama and his representatives did not respond to Fox News Digital's previous requests for comment, Democratic lawmakers have reacted to the development with their own series of statements.\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, criticized Gabbard's claims as \"baseless.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Few episodes in our nation\u2019s history have been investigated as thoroughly as the Intelligence Community\u2019s warning in 2016 that Russia was interfering in the election,\" Himes said in a statement posted to X.\n\"Every legitimate investigation, including the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation, found no evidence of politicization and endorsed the findings of the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment.\"\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Gabbard of \"weaponizing her position to amplify the president's election conspiracy theories.\"\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report."

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are under criminal investigation for potential wrongdoing related to the Trump\u2013Russia probe, including allegedly making false statements to Congress, Justice Department sources told Fox News Digital.\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe referred evidence of wrongdoing by Brennan to FBI Director Kash Patel for potential prosecution, DOJ sources told Fox News Digital.\nThe sources said that the referral was received and told Fox News Digital that a criminal investigation into Brennan was opened and is underway. DOJ sources declined to provide further details. It is unclear, at this point, if the investigation spans beyond his alleged false statements to Congress.\nAs for Comey, DOJ sources told Fox News Digital that an investigation into the former director is underway, but could not share details of what specifically is being probed.\nThe full scope of the criminal investigations into Brennan and Comey is unclear, but two sources described the FBI's view of the duo's interactions as a \"conspiracy,\" which could open up a wide range of potential prosecutorial options.\nThe FBI and CIA declined to comment.\nNeither Brennan nor Comey immediately responded to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.\nThe Brennan investigation comes after Ratcliffe last week declassified a \"lessons learned\" review of the creation of the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA). The 2017 ICA alleged Russia sought to influence the 2016 presidential election to help then-candidate Donald Trump. But the review found that the process of the ICA's creation was rushed with \"procedural anomalies,\" and that officials diverted from intelligence standards.\nWHITE HOUSE WANTS OBAMA INTEL OFFICIALS 'HELD ACCOUNTABLE' FOR ROLE PEDDLING 2016 RUSSIA HOAX\nIt also determined that the \"decision by agency heads to include the Steele Dossier in the ICA ran counter to fundamental tradecraft principles and ultimately undermined the credibility of a key judgment.\"\nThe dossier \u2014 an anti-Trump document filled with unverified and wholly inaccurate claims that was commissioned by Fusion GPS and paid for by Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC \u2014 has been widely discredited. Last week's review marks the first time career CIA officials have acknowledged politicization of the process by which the ICA was written, particularly by Obama-era political appointees.\nRecords declassified as part of that review further revealed that Brennan did, in fact, push for the dossier to be included in the 2017 ICA.\nBrennan testified to the House Judiciary Committee in May 2023, however, that he did not believe the dossier should be included in that intelligence product.\nCOMEY SAYS MCCABE LIED, CONFIRMS HE KICK-STARTED PROBE THAT LED TO HIS FIRING\nRatcliffe was not surprised by the review's findings, a source familiar told Fox News Digital, given the director's long history of criticizing Brennan's politicization of intelligence. But Ratcliffe was compelled to refer aspects of Brennan\u2019s involvement to the FBI for review of possible criminality, the source said.\nThe source was unable to share the sensitive details of Ratcliffe\u2019s criminal referral to the FBI with Fox News Digital, but said that Brennan \"violated the public\u2019s trust and should be held accountable for it.\"\nThe false statements portion of the probe stems from a newly declassified email sent to Brennan by the former deputy CIA director in December 2016. That message said that including the dossier in the ICA in any capacity jeopardized \"the credibility of the entire paper.\"\nFISA REPORT DROPS: 7 TAKEAWAYS FROM DOJ WATCHDOG'S REVIEW OF RUSSIA PROBE\n\"Despite these objections, Brennan showed a preference for narrative consistency over analytical soundness,\" the new CIA review states. \"When confronted with specific flaws in the Dossier by the two mission center leaders \u2013 one with extensive operational experience and the other with a strong analytic background \u2013 he appeared more swayed by the Dossier's general conformity with existing theories than by legitimate tradecraft concerns.\"\nThe review added: \"Brennan ultimately formalized his position in writing, stating that \u2018my bottomline is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report.\u2019\"\nBut Brennan testified the opposite in front of Congress in May 2023.\n\"The CIA was very much opposed to having any reference or inclusion of the Steele dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment,\" Brennan testified before the House committee, according to the transcript of his deposition reviewed by Fox News Digital. \"And so they sent over a copy of the dossier to say that this was going to be separate from the rest of that assessment.\"\nFLASHBACK: NEWLY DECLASSIFIED INTEL DOCUMENT NOTED STEELE DOSSIER CLAIMS HAD 'LIMITED CORROBORATION'\nCIA officials at the time of its creation pushed back against the FBI, which sought to include the dossier, arguing that the dossier should not be included in the assessment, and casting it as simply \"internet rumor.\"\nUltimately, Steele\u2019s reporting was not included in the body of the final ICA prepared for then-President Barack Obama, but instead detailed in this footnote, \"largely at the insistence of FBI\u2019s senior leadership,\" according to a review by the Justice Department inspector general, and later, the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nBut back in June 2020, Ratcliffe, while serving as director of national intelligence, declassified a footnote of the 2017 ICA, which revealed that the reporting of Trump dossier author Christopher Steele had only \"limited corroboration\" regarding whether then-President-elect Trump \"knowingly worked with Russian officials to bolster his chances of beating\" Hillary Clinton and other claims.\nThe footnote, also known as \"Annex A\" of the 2017 ICA, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in June 2020, spanned less than two pages and detailed reporting by Steele, the former British spy who authored the unverified anti-Trump dossier \u2014 a document that helped serve as the basis for controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\nSteele\u2019s reporting, at the time, was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) through law firm Perkins Coie.\nThe footnote made clear the internal concerns officials had over that document.\n\"An FBI source (Steele) using both identified and unidentified subsources, volunteered highly politically sensitive information from the summer to the fall of 2016 on Russian influence efforts aimed at the US presidential election,\" the annex read. \"We have only limited corroboration of the source\u2019s reporting in this case and did not use it to reach the analytic conclusions of the CIA/FBI/NSA assessment.\"\n\"The source collected this information on behalf of private clients and was not compensated for it by the FBI,\" it continued.\nBut the annex notes that Steele's reporting was \"not developed by the layered subsource network.\"\n\"The FBI source caveated that, although similar to previously provided reporting in terms of content, the source was unable to vouch for the additional information's sourcing and accuracy,\" the annex states. \"Hence this information is not included in this product.\"\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz also reviewed the inclusion of Steele\u2019s reporting in the ICA during his review of alleged misconduct related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.\nHis report, released in late 2019, found that there were \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" in FISA warrants for former Trump campaign aide Page. Those warrants relied heavily on Steele\u2019s reporting, despite the FBI not having had specific information corroborating allegations against Page that were included in Steele\u2019s reporting.\nMeanwhile, Fox News Digital exclusively reported in October 2020 that Brennan briefed former President Obama and administration officials on intelligence that then-Democrat nominee former Secretary of State Clinton was stirring up a plan to tie Trump to Russia.\nRatcliffe, as director of national intelligence, declassified Brennan\u2019s handwritten notes memorializing that meeting, which were exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in October 2020.\nOn July 28, 2016, Brennan briefed Obama on a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisors \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"\nComey, then-Vice President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were in the Brennan-Obama briefing.\nFLASHBACK: DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCS TO DATE: WHAT TO KNOW\nAfter that briefing, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\nFox News Digital exclusively obtained and reported on the CIOL in October 2020, which stated: \"The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.\"\n\"Per FBI verbal request, CIA provides the below examples of information the CROSSFIRE HURRICANE fusion cell has gleaned to date,\" the memo continued. \"An exchange (REDACTED) discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.\"\nThe FBI on July 31, 2016, opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\nFormer Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take over the FBI\u2019s original \"Crossfire Hurricane\" investigation. After nearly two years, Mueller\u2019s investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.\nShortly after, John Durham was appointed as special counsel to investigate the origins of the \"Crossfire Hurricane\" probe.\nDurham found that the FBI \"failed to act\" on a \"clear warning sign\" that the bureau was the \"target\" of a Clinton-led effort to \"manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes\" ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\"The aforementioned facts reflect a rather startling and inexplicable failure to adequately consider and incorporate the Clinton Plan intelligence into the FBI\u2019s investigative decision-making in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,\" Durham\u2019s report states.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Indeed, had the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation as an assessment and, in turn, gathered and analyzed data in concert with the information from the Clinton Plan intelligence, it is likely that the information received would have been examined, at a minimum, with a more critical eye,\" the report continued.\nDurham, in his report, said the FBI \"failed to act on what should have been\u2014when combined with other incontrovertible facts\u2014 a clear warning sign that the FBI might then be the target of an effort to manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes during the 2016 presidential election.\"\nMeanwhile, the White House wants the Obama-era intelligence officials to be held accountable.\n\"President Trump was right \u2014 again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Those who engaged in this political scandal must be held accountable for the fraud they committed against President Trump and the lies they told to the American people.\""

      "text": "Obama-era intelligence officials acknowledged that they had no \"empirical evidence\" of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, but continued to publicly push the \"narrative\" of collusion.\nThe House Intelligence Committee, in 2017, conducted depositions of top Obama intelligence officials, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, national security advisor Susan Rice and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, among others.\nThe officials\u2019 responses in the transcripts of those interviews align with the results of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2013 which found no evidence of criminal coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016, while not reaching a determination on obstruction of justice.\nTheir testimony has come back into the spotlight amid revelations that former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are under criminal investigation for potential wrongdoing related to the Trump\u2013Russia probe, including allegedly making false statements to Congress, Justice Department sources exclusively told Fox News Digital.\nThe transcripts, from 2017 and 2018, revealed top Obama officials were questioned by House Intelligence Committee lawmakers and investigators about whether they had or had seen evidence of such collusion, coordination or conspiracy \u2013 the issue that drove the FBI's initial case and later the special counsel probe.\n\"I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting/conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election,\" Clapper testified in 2017. \"That\u2019s not to say that there weren\u2019t concerns about the evidence we were seeing, anecdotal evidence.... But I do not recall any instance where I had direct evidence.\"\nLynch also said she did \"not recall that being briefed up to me.\"\n\"I can't say that it existed or not,\" Lynch said, referring to evidence of collusion, conspiracy or coordination.\nBut Clapper and Lynch, and Vice President Joe Biden, were present in the Oval Office on July 28, 2016, when Brennan briefed Obama and Comey on intelligence he\u2019d received from one of Hillary Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisors \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"\nKEY PLAYERS IN ORIGINS OF TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE\n\"We\u2019re getting additional insight into Russian activities from (REDACTED),\" Brennan\u2019s handwritten notes, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in October 2020, read. \"CITE (summarizing) alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"\nAfter that briefing, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\nFox News Digital exclusively obtained and reported on the CIOL in October 2020, which stated: \"The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.\"\n\"Per FBI verbal request, CIA provides the below examples of information the CROSSFIRE HURRICANE fusion cell has gleaned to date,\" the memo continued. \"An exchange (REDACTED) discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.\"\nThe FBI did not open an investigation into the matter, and instead, continued with its counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign.\nDays after the Brennan meeting to brief Obama, Biden, Comey, Clapper and Lynch on July 31, 2016, the FBI opened the original Trump\u2013Russia investigation, which was referred to inside the bureau as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\nMeanwhile, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, according to the transcript of her interview to the House Intelligence Committee, was asked whether she had or saw any evidence of collusion or conspiracy.\nPower replied: \"I am not in possession of anything \u2013 I am not in possession and didn\u2019t read or absorb information that came from out of the intelligence community.\"\nWhen asked again, she said: \"I am not.\"\nObama national security advisor Susan Rice was asked the same question.\n\"To the best of my recollection, there wasn\u2019t anything smoking, but there were some things that gave me pause,\" she said, according to her transcribed interview, in response to whether she had any evidence of conspiracy. \"I don\u2019t recall intelligence that I would consider evidence to that effect that I saw\u2026 conspiracy prior to my departure.\"\nWhen asked whether she had any evidence of \"coordination,\" Rice replied: \"I don\u2019t recall any intelligence or evidence to that effect.\"\nWhen asked about collusion, Rice replied: \"Same answer.\"\nFormer deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes was asked the same question during his House Intelligence interview.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t have received any information on any criminal or counterintelligence investigations into what the Trump campaign was doing, so I would not have seen that information,\" Rhodes said.\nWhen pressed again, he said: \"I saw indications of potential coordination, but I did not see, you know, the specific evidence of the actions of the Trump campaign.\"\nMeanwhile, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was not asked that specific question but rather questions about the accuracy and legitimacy of the unverified anti-Trump dossier compiled by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.\nMcCabe was asked during his interview in 2017 what was the most \"damning or important piece of evidence in the dossier that\" he \"now knows is true.\"\nMcCabe replied: \"We have not been able to prove the accuracy of all the information.\"\n\"You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not?\" a House investigator asked, to which McCabe replied: \"That\u2019s correct.\"\n\u2018Narrative consistency\u2019\nAfter Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and during the presidential transition period, Comey briefed Trump on the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier, containing salacious allegations of purported coordination between Trump and the Russian government. Brennan was present for that briefing, which took place at Trump Tower in New York City in January 2017.\nThe dossier was authored by Steele. It was funded by Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the law firm Perkins Coie.\nBut Brennan and Comey knew of intelligence suggesting Clinton, during the campaign, was stirring up a plan to tie Trump to Russia, documents claim. It is unclear whether the intelligence community, at the time, knew that the dossier was paid for by Clinton and the DNC.\nFBI LAUNCHES CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF JOHN BRENNAN, JAMES COMEY: DOJ SOURCES\nBut the false statements portion of the new investigation into Brennan and Comey stems from a newly declassified email to Brennan from the former deputy CIA director in December 2016, which said that including the dossier in the ICA in any capacity jeopardized \"the credibility of the entire paper.\"\n\"Despite these objections, Brennan showed a preference for narrative consistency over analytical soundness,\" the new CIA review stated. \"When confronted with specific flaws in the Dossier by the two mission center leaders \u2013 one with extensive operational experience and the other with a strong analytic background \u2013 he appeared more swayed by the Dossier's general conformity with existing theories than by legitimate tradecraft concerns.\"\nThe review added: \"Brennan ultimately formalized his position in writing, stating that \u2018my bottomline is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report.\u2019\"\nBut Brennan testified the opposite before the House Judiciary Committee in May 2023.\n\"The CIA was very much opposed to having any reference or inclusion of the Steele dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment,\" Brennan testified before the committee, according to the transcript of his deposition reviewed by Fox News Digital. \"And so they sent over a copy of the dossier to say that this was going to be separate from the rest of that assessment.\"\nCIA officials at the time of its creation pushed back against the FBI, which sought to include the dossier, arguing that the dossier should not be included in the assessment, and casting it as simply \"internet rumor.\"\nUltimately, Steele\u2019s reporting was not included in the body of the final ICA prepared for then-President Barack Obama, but instead detailed in this footnote, \"largely at the insistence of FBI\u2019s senior leadership,\" according to a review by the Justice Department inspector general, and later, the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nBut in June 2020, Ratcliffe, while serving as director of national intelligence, declassified a footnote of the 2017 ICA, which revealed that the reporting of Trump dossier author Steele only had \"limited corroboration\" regarding whether then-President-elect Trump \"knowingly worked with Russian officials to bolster his chances of beating\" Hillary Clinton and other claims.\nThe footnote, also known as \"Annex A\" of the 2017 ICA, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in June 2020, spanned less than two pages and detailed reporting by Steele \u2013 a document that helped serve as the basis for controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\nThe footnote made clear the internal concerns officials had over that document.\n\"An FBI source (Steele) using both identified and unidentified subsources, volunteered highly politically sensitive information from the summer to the fall of 2016 on Russian influence efforts aimed at the US presidential election,\" the annex read. \"We have only limited corroboration of the source\u2019s reporting in this case and did not use it to reach the analytic conclusions of the CIA/FBI/NSA assessment.\"\n\"The source collected this information on behalf of private clients and was not compensated for it by the FBI,\" it continued.\nBut the annex notes that Steele's reporting was \"not developed by the layered subsource network.\"\n\"The FBI source caveated that, although similar to previously provided reporting in terms of content, the source was unable to vouch for the additional information's sourcing and accuracy,\" the annex states. \"Hence this information is not included in this product.\"\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz also reviewed the inclusion of Steele\u2019s reporting in the ICA during his review of alleged misconduct related to FISA.\nTRUMP SAYS BRENNAN, COMEY 'CROOKED AS HELL' AMID FBI PROBE, MAY HAVE TO 'PAY THE PRICE'\nHis report, released in late 2019, found that there were \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" in FISA warrants for former Trump campaign aide Page.

I know it\u2019s an abhorrent thought, but imagine being Hillary, having initiated the greatest political dirty trick of all time, watching Russiagate unspool over the past decade. Think of her witnessing the country go down the granddaddy of all rabbit holes in 2017 \u2013 a rabbit hole she personally helped dig -- looking for proof of Russian collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin that she knew didn\u2019t exist.\nWhat was she thinking as the country hired a special prosecutor and spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to pursue leads that she and her campaign team had fabricated out of thin air? Was she ever remorseful? Was there ever a moment when she wanted to reel in the whole sorry deception and tell the country that she was sorry, and that she had lied?\nNo, there was not. Hillary Clinton even wrote a book called \"What Happened?\" in which she blamed Putin, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and former CIA Director James Comey for her shocking loss to Donald Trump, a non-politician whom she mocked and derided. To this day, she sticks to her self-serving fable, that Russian President Vladimir Putin was out to get her and, but for his interference, she would surely have become the country\u2019s first female president.\nThe reality is that Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate, disliked and distrusted by most Americans. Polling from CNN that came out about the time of the 2016 Democrat Convention gives a taste of what voters thought of Clinton. The Washington Post reported, \"68 percent say Clinton isn't honest and trustworthy\u2026 her worst number on-record\u2026. The 30 percent who see Clinton as honest and trustworthy is now well shy of the number who say the same of Trump: 43 percent.\"\nThe public was right not to trust Clinton; the more we learn about Russiagate, and her role in it, the more apparent that is.\nAny normal person would conclude that Clinton, whose approval rating CNN pegged at a dismal 31% in July 2016, was not a shoo-in come the November election. Barack Obama had been president for eight years and the country had become less Democrat-leaning during his term; only 31% of the nation identified as Democrat in 2016, while 36% had described themselves as true blue in 2008, when he was first elected.\nDAVID MARCUS: THE RUSSIA HOAX IS SIMPLE. DEMOCRATS LIED AND HALF THE COUNTRY BELIEVED THEM\nThough expressing confidence that she would win, maybe Hillary knew she had to pull out all stops to beat Donald Trump. Perhaps that\u2019s why she signed off on two dirty tricks that led to the despicable undermining of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\nFirst, her former campaign manager Robby Mook testified in court that she personally approved her campaign\u2019s scheme in October 2016 to tell a Slate magazine reporter about an unverified server backchannel between the Trump Organization and Alfa bank in Moscow. This supposed connection formed the first step in trying to convince the public that Donald Trump was a tool of Vladimir Putin. The purported link never existed, but it was widely publicized by Hillary\u2019s supporters and the legacy media (I repeat myself), creating suspicion in the public\u2019s mind.\nAfter the Slate story emerged, weeks before the election, Hillary put out a tweet claiming \"Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank,\" followed up by a news release in which she said, \"This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\"\nThe FBI subsequently concluded no \"hotline,\" indeed no link, ever existed. Interestingly, another apparatchik pushing the Trump-Alfa bank lie was Jake Sullivan, later presumably rewarded by President Joe Biden appointing the unknown politico to be National Security Adviser.\nOf course, the bigger and more destructive Russia collusion lie that Hillary helped originate came from the salacious allegations contained in the Steele dossier, paid for by the Clinton campaign, which led to the longtime investigation into Russian interference and the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is a fact, verified by the fact that the Federal Election Commission under Biden penalized the campaign and the DNC for lying about having funded that opposition research.\nThe story, however, goes on. New revelations have revived accusations that Hillary Clinton, as well as Barack Obama, James Comey, John Brennan and others manipulated intelligence and facts to feed the public even more lies about Donald Trump\u2019s supposed ties to Russia.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAmazingly, the New York Times has again leapt into the breach to protect Clinton, perhaps concerned they might lose their 2018 Pulitzer earned for helping promote a fake news story. They reference, \"An annex to a report by the special counsel John H. Durham\" but claim the disclosures are an effort by \"the Trump team [seeking] to distract from the Jeffrey Epstein files.\" They write that GOP allegations that \"Mrs. Clinton had approved a campaign proposal to tie Mr. Trump to Russia to distract from the scandal over her use of a private email server\" is not valid because\u2026the damning emails contained in the annex are likely fabrications from Russian spies. Sure.\nWill we ever know the complete truth about the plot hatched to discredit the Trump presidency? Probably not, and it is probably also true that key players like Hillary Clinton will never be held accountable.\nBut, as Hillary watches the ongoing revelations coming from the Trump White House, we can also imagine that she is getting her comeuppance. Her treachery and deceit -\u2013 knowing how badly she has abused the public\u2019s trust -- has surely shriveled her soul, leaving her bitter and defeated.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPeople now see her as a corrupt schemer, someone who knew she could not win an election on her merits and so resorted to lies and fabrications that hurt the country.\nWe also now see her as someone who didn\u2019t just attack President Trump, but also the 61 million Americans who voted for him in 2016."

      "text": "Former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper responded sharply Wednesday to Trump administration allegations that they cooked intel in the sprawling Russia investigation that dominated the president's first term.\n\"That is patently false. In making those allegations, they seek to rewrite history. We want to set the record straight and, in doing so, sound a warning,\" the pair wrote in a guest essay for The New York Times.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has alleged former President Barack Obama and members of his administration, including Clapper and Brennan, promoted a \"contrived narrative\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Trump, which led to the sprawling collusion investigation that consumed Trump's presidency. Trump has described the alleged actions by Obama, Clapper, Brennan and Comey as \"serious treason.\"\n\"While some external critiques have noted that parts of the Russia investigation could have been handled better, multiple, thorough, years-long reviews of the assessment have validated its findings and the rigor of its analysis,\" Brennan and Clapper wrote, arguing the most \"noteworthy\" example was the bipartisan Senate Intelligence report on the investigation.\n\"Every serious review has substantiated the intelligence community\u2019s fundamental conclusion that the Russians conducted an influence campaign intended to help Mr. Trump win the 2016 election,\" the pair continued. \"Although the misrepresentations and disinformation of the administration are too numerous to address here, let us set the record straight on three. To be clear, we are writing here in our personal capacities, and our views don\u2019t imply the endorsement of any federal agency.\"\nBrennan and Clapper argued that the Steele Dossier, which was authored by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and funded by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the DNC, was not used as a source or taken into account for any of the analysis. However, they added it was included as a \"separate annex only to the most highly classified version of the document that contained the assessment,\" at the direction of the FBI.\nThe intelligence officials also said that their assessment made \"no judgment\" about the impact of the Russian operation on the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\"Russian influence operations might have shaped the views of Americans before they entered the voting booth, but we found no evidence that the Russians changed any actual votes,\" Clapper and Brennan wrote.\nClapper appeared on CNN to dispute the allegations, telling host Kaitlan Collins that the claims were false. Brennan joined MSNBC earlier this month and said he was \"clueless\" as to why he would be investigated.\n\"Finally, and contrary to the Trump administration\u2019s wild and baseless claims, there was no mention of \u2018collusion\u2019 between the Trump campaign and the Russians in the assessment, nor any reference to the publicly acknowledged contacts that had taken place,\" Clapper and Brennan added.\nThe pair insisted the \"real politicization\" was coming from members of Trump's administration, specifically Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"The real politicization is the calculated distortion of intelligence by administration officials, notably Mr. Trump\u2019s directors of national intelligence and the C.I.A., positions that should be apolitical. We find it deeply regrettable that the administration continues to perpetuate the fictitious narrative that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election. It should instead acknowledge that a foreign nation-state \u2014 a mortal enemy of the United States \u2014 routinely meddles in our national elections and will continue to do so unless we take appropriate bipartisan action to stop it,\" Clapper and Brennan concluded.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately receive a response."

      "text": "This week, Washington was rocked by new releases in the declassification of material related to the origins of the Russian investigation. The material shows further evidence of a secret plan by the Clinton campaign to use the FBI and media to spread a false claim that Donald Trump was a Russian asset. With this material, the public is finally seeing how officials and reporters set into motion what may be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated in American politics.\nThere never was a Russian collusion conspiracy. This is the emerging story of the real Russian conspiracy to manufacture a false narrative that succeeded in devouring much of the first term of the Trump administration.\nWhat is emerging in these documents is a political illusion carefully constructed by government officials and a willing media. The brilliance of the trick was getting reporters to buy into the illusion; to own it like members of an audience called to the stage by an illusionist.\nPATEL FOUND THOUSANDS OF SENSITIVE TRUMP\u2013RUSSIA PROBE DOCS INSIDE 'BURN BAGS' IN SECRET ROOM AT FBI\nThe effort closely followed the three steps of the classic magic trick: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.\nThe Pledge\nThe trick began with the pledge, the stage where the public is set up by showing ordinary events with the suggestion that it is about to transform into something extraordinary. The key is to make something seem real that is actually not.\nThe Clinton campaign delivered the pledge by secretly funding the Steele dossier, using Fusion GPS and a former British spy named Christopher Steele, to create a salacious account of Trump being an agent of Russia.\nIt was Elias who was the general counsel to the Clinton presidential campaign when it funded the infamous Steele dossier and pushed the false Alfa Bank conspiracy. (His fellow Perkins Coie partner, Michael Sussmann, was indicted but acquitted in a criminal trial.)\nDuring the campaign, a few reporters asked about the possible connection to the campaign, but Clinton campaign officials denied any involvement in the Steele Dossier. After the election, journalists discovered that the payments for the Steele dossier were hidden as \"legal fees\" among the $5.6 million paid to Perkins Coie under Elias.\nWhen New York Times reporter Ken Vogel tried to report the story, he said, Elias \"pushed back vigorously, saying \u2018You (or your sources) are wrong.\u2019\" Times reporter Maggie Haberman declared, \"Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year.\"\nLater, John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, appeared before Congress for questioning on the Steele dossier. Podesta emphatically denied any contractual agreement with Fusion GPS. Sitting beside him was Elias, who reportedly said nothing to correct the misleading information given to Congress.\nThe FEC ultimately sanctioned the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee over the handling of the funding of the dossier through his prior firm.\nThe Turn\nThe next step is the turn when the ordinary becomes something extraordinary. This required the involvement of the government. The Clinton team worked behind the scenes to feed the dossier to the FBI. It would be the criminal investigation that would transform the ordinary accounts, like Carter Page speaking in Moscow, into an elaborate Russian plot. Even though the FBI was warned early on that Page was a CIA asset, not a Russian asset, the Clinton team found eager officials in the Obama administration to assist in the illusion.\nThe newly disclosed evidence shows how the turn was made. In July 2016, Brennan briefed former President Obama on Hillary Clinton\u2019s \"plan\" to tie then-candidate Trump to Russia as \"a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.\" The original Russia investigation \u2014 funded by Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2014 was launched days after this briefing.\nMonths later, it would be Brennan who overruled his own CIA analysts in his ordering of a second last-minute assessment at the end of the Obama administration in support of the Russian allegations. It would help make the turn with the all-consuming Russian investigation that would follow.\nCareer analysts were not buying the turn. They objected that the reliance on the Steele dossier \"ran counter to fundamental tradecraft principles and ultimately undermined the credibility of a key judgment.\" One CIA analyst told investigators that \"[Brennan] refused to remove it, and when confronted with the dossier\u2019s main flaws, [Brennan] responded, \u2018Yes, but doesn\u2019t it ring true?\u2019\"\nThat is the key to the turn; it needs only to be enough to fool the audience.\nThe Prestige\nThe final stage is called the Prestige, where the magician faces the toughest part of the trick. As explained in the 2006 movie \"The Prestige,\" the viewer is \"looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled.\" However, \"making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe difference is that this trick was designed to derail Trump and it worked. In the end, however, the Special Counsel and Inspector General both rejected the Russian collusion claims. The public then reelected Trump. Now, the prestige may be revealed by the CIA.\nReports indicate that the CIA is about to declassify material showing that foreign sources were also in on the trick. The information reportedly indicates that foreign sources were aware of the move to create a Russian collusion scandal and expected that the FBI would play a role in the plan. That was before the bureau launched its controversial Crossfire Hurricane probe. One source said the foreign intelligence predicted the move \"with alarming specificity.\"\nThe most recently declassified material shows that the Russian actors in 2016 hacked emails from the Open Society Foundations, formerly known as the Soros Foundation. The emails show an even wider circle of activists and allies who were aware of the Clinton conspiracy.\nLeonard Bernardo, who was the regional director for Eurasia at the Open Society Foundations, explained that \"during the first stage of the campaign, due to lack of direct evidence, it was decided to disseminate the necessary information through the FBI-affiliated\u2026from where the information would then be disseminated through leading U.S. publications.\"\nBernardo added, \"Julie (Clinton Campaign Advisor) says it will be a long-term affair to demonize Putin and Trump. Now it is good for a post-convention bounce. Later, the FBI will put more oil into the fire.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe media (including the Washington Post and New York Times, which won Pulitzer prizes for reporting on the debunked claims) are apoplectic in dismissing these disclosures. The last thing they will do is report on how they helped sell a political hoax. The problem is that they never said it was a trick. They said it was the truth. That is why CIA Director John Ratcliff's big reveals have this town on the edge of its seat.\nIt appears that everyone was in on the trick: the U.S. government, the media, even foreign governments. The only chumps were the American people. Now they are about to see how it was done."
