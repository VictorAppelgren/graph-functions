      "feedback": "Strong start tying 0–3 weeks to AL90/Fernand and sanctuary‑policy risk; but to reach world‑class, tighten the causal chain, drop irrelevant sources, and weaponize concrete numbers. Actionable edits: constrain citations to the five SOURCE MATERIAL IDs that actually matter here (primarily 0R5LB61YY for AL90/Fernand CSU forecast and Bermuda exposure, and U1KRCQOYR for the sanctuary funding injunction, plus S7M6BJSRT to ground finance/rates context) and eliminate references to non‑source items (e.g., AccuWeather/11 and unrelated tech reviews); present a single, testable base/ upside/ downside scenario with explicit thresholds (base: AL90 rapidly forms into a tropical depression then Fernand by Sunday; Bermuda track with potential hurricane conditions; max wind gusts 60–80 mph; inches of rain as forecast by 0R5LB61YY/11, and CSU’s eight hurricanes, three majors with a 48% major landfall probability); add clear triggers for invalidation (Fernand fails to form, or recurs to a weak tropical storm; AL99 fails to develop or tracks far from Caribbean; sanctuary list narrowed or stayed unchanged); quantify expected market/price signals (e.g., risk premia moves if Bermuda exposure materializes or if policy injunctions broaden; credit spreads/loan costs as proxies via S7M6BJSRT language on rates and prequalification) and tie them to asset classes (insurance pricing, reinsurance, risk assets). Improve structure to mirror the horizon focus by mapping each driver to immediate reaction functions and key levels to monitor (NHC advisories on AL90/FERNAND, CSU/season outlook updates, the DOJ‑DOJ list status, and prequalification rate movements) with a concise, 1–2 sentence monitoring plan. Ensure the tone is scenario‑driven, avoid generic statements, and weave in probabilistic framing (e.g., AL90 formation near 100% within 48 hours; AL99 ~20% over 7 days) directly from 0R5LB61YY, and keep the narrative anchored to the specified sources throughout.",
