      "feedback": "This piece would be world-class with a tighter, causally linked 0–3 week thesis that is anchored in the actual near‑term drivers you cite and then translated into explicit, testable catalysts and price- and data‑level thresholds. Key fixes: (1) align the causality to the SECTION FOCUS by foregrounding 0–3 week drivers from sources: Jackson Hole/BoJ wage‑growth signals (K0WFSW29E) as the core macro leash, plus political risk from Trump’s actions (YB758UDBU) and the behavior of rate‑sensitive names as a market read on policy expectations (TXVQ5ZQ0N, H9WSBYP3D). Replace the claim that rate cuts are the near‑term catalyst with a “rate‑path uncertainty” view that hinges on central bank signals and inflation data; (2) structure the analysis into a clear baseline, upside, and downside with explicit triggers, not a free‑form narrative. For example, baseline: policy paths remain data‑dependent with Jackson Hole signaling cautious easing bias only if inflation cools and wage dynamics stay transitory; upside: clearer easing bias or positive policy surprises lift rate‑sensitive equities; downside: hawkish surprises or renewed political/legal uncertainty depress risk assets; (3) embed concrete catalysts/triggers and invalidation rules tied to the sources: for Joby (TXVQ5ZQ0N), current price ≈ US$14.95 with a consensus fair value of US$10.83 and a PB of 14.2x; a durable move above the US$15–16 zone or a persistent gap above fair value for 1–2 weeks should trigger a re‑rating note; for Opendoor (H9WSBYP3D), price around US$5.01 vs a consensus target of US$1.39; sustained >US$4.50 with rising sell‑side targets would warrant a re‑assessment of optimism vs. fundamentals; (4) ground the analysis in first‑principles about wage/credit dynamics and supply‑side shifts (K0WFSW29E; S7M6BJSRT) and link consumer credit framing to the current loan‑rate landscape (S7M6BJSRT); (5) quantify and cite numbers precisely from the IDs you’re allowed: cite K0WFSW29E for BoJ wage/supply‑side dynamics; TXVQ5ZQ0N and H9WSBYP3D for stock moves and valuation context; YB758UDBU for political risk; S7M6BJSRT for personal‑loan/credit factors; (6) eliminate non‑ID links (e.g., the gobankingrates URL) and consolidate all quantitative references to the six identified sources; (7) tighten prose to a compact, transmission‑focused paragraph that maps 0–3 weeks to concrete data/prints (inflation prints, Jackson Hole remarks, BoJ signaling, U.S. rate‑path hints) and to explicit levels/invalidations; (8) end with a precise monitor list for the next 2–3 weeks: Jackson Hole remarks cadence, U.S. inflation prints, central bank communications, and the price‑level/valuation thresholds on Joby and Opendoor plus any shifts in the Trump‑era political risk backdrop.",
