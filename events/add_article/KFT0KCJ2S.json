      "summary": "Scientists, including 85 American and international experts, have publicly denounced a Trump administration climate report that downplays climate change, citing errors, misrepresentations, and cherry‑picked data. The report, produced by handpicked Energy Department scientists, was used to justify repealing greenhouse‑gas limits and supports the administration’s push to expand fossil‑fuel use. The scientific rebuttal, a 439‑page peer review, challenges the report’s claims on carbon dioxide, health impacts, and climate risks, and highlights the potential policy influence of the flawed analysis. The backlash underscores the tension between political agendas and established climate science.",
