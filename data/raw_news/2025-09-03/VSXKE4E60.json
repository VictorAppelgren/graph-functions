  "title": "'South Park' Season 27: When Does the Next Episode Come Out?",
  "description": "The hit satirical show is back this week.",
  "content": "If you've been around for the start of South Park season 27, you know its rollout has been hectic. The hit animated show had its season 27 premiere date pushed by two weeks and then announced its second installment would drop two weeks after the first. We're now several weeks in and it's easier to predict when new South Park episodes will debut.\n\nAccording to the show's website, South Park will continue to release episodes every other week at least through episode 5. Episode 4, \"Wok is Dead,\" airs on Comedy Central later today. The forthcoming installment has a trailer and a description: \"Butters experiences the reality of tariffs when he has to buy a Labubu doll for his girlfriend's birthday.\"\n\nWhile we don't have additional details on future South Park episodes, another aspect of the show is more definitive: its new streaming home. With the signing of a deal in July, 50 new South Park episodes and the show's back catalog will be on Comedy Central and Paramount Plus. Forthcoming episodes of season 27 will stream on Paramount Plus in the US the day after airing on Comedy Central. The show is no longer available on HBO Max as of early August.\n\nIf you want to watch the 27th season of the show co-created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, here's what to know.\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\n\nEpisode 4 will air on Comedy Central on Wednesday, Sept. 3 at 10 p.m. ET, 10 p.m. PT or 9 p.m. CT and stream on Paramount Plus the next day (the first three episodes are already on the streaming service). Episode 5 will air on Comedy Central on Wednesday, Sept. 17.\n\nSeason 27 episodes will hit Paramount Plus in the US the day after they air on Comedy Central. If you don't want to wait that long to watch without cable, you might want to consider a live TV streaming service like Philo, Sling or YouTube TV. More on that below.",

      "text": "Pros\n- More popular channels than any competitor\n- Superb cloud DVR\n- Excellent on-screen interface and handy search bar\nCons\n- $10 upgrade doesn't include much 4K content\nYouTube TV has solidified its reputation as one of the best live TV streaming services available. The Google-owned platform features an extensive array of channels and is known for its easy-to-navigate user experience. These are important details to highlight, considering the fact that the streamer has steadily increased its price over the years. It now costs $83 a month, which is more than twice its original cost. It may feel like the overall value of the service isn't as clear-cut as it once was, but its price mirrors that of its closest rival, Hulu Plus Live TV.\nYouTube TV's main strength for cord-cutters is its sheer number of channels. It now offers 78 of the top 100 networks, the most of any streaming service, a count that includes numerous cable staples plus all four local networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- and local PBS stations nationwide.\nBeyond channels, YouTube TV is easy to use: It's slick and speedy on a variety of TVs and mobile devices. Its cloud DVR is also one of the best, with unlimited storage and pretty much all the capabilities of a hardware DVR. The service also offers a 4K streaming upgrade -- for an additional $10 monthly -- which, importantly, includes unlimited simultaneous streams and downloadable DVR recordings.\nThe big snag is the price, and if you're a cord-cutter, the trimmed-down Sling TV Blue at $46 a month is the best way to save money. At the other end of the spectrum, the $83 Hulu Plus Live TV offers a similar mix of channels, but the addition of the modified Disney Bundle that gives you access to on-demand Hulu, ESPN Plus and Disney Plus, brings some extra value. If you're wanting to stick with a familiar cable tv experience, the myriad of channels and unlimited DVR feature offered by YouTube TV makes the $83 price associated with its base package well worth the money. It's still a good deal for what you're getting.\nRead more: Best Streaming Devices\nWhat do you get?\nYouTube TV is different from YouTube, the free video service with more than 2.5 billion users a month. YouTube TV offers an experience similar to cable TV, with live channels and on-demand content available on a variety of devices. It works with Apple TV, Roku, Android TV, Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV, along with numerous smart TVs, phones, tablets, game consoles and web browsers.\nPremium services compared\n| YouTube TV | Hulu with Live TV | Fubo | Sling | Sling Orange & Blue | DirecTV | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Monthly Price | $83 | $83 | $85 | $46 | $66 | $87 |\n| Total Channels | 100+ | 95+ | 150+ | 34+ | 46+ | 90+ |\n| RSNs? | Limited | Limited | Yes | No | No | Yes |\n| Number of simultaneous streams | 3 | 2 (Pay an extra $10/month unlimited) | 10 at home (3 outside home) | 1 for Sling Orange, 3 for Sling Blue | 4 | Unlimited at home (3 outside home) |\n| Cloud DVR | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | 50 hours (pay $5/month for unlimited) | 50 hours (pay $5/month for unlimited) | Unlimited |\nYouTube TV's channel selection is excellent, with more from CNET's list of 100 top channels than any other competitor (although Hulu isn't too far behind). More channels don't necessarily mean more of what you want. Some services, such as Fubo, lean heavily on sports, while others are increasingly expansive. It's best to check the list at the end of this article, which compares individual channels across services, to ensure you're getting the channels you want. While competitors include several channel upgrade packages, YouTube TV includes everything for one price, with one exception explained below.\nThe service also includes 5.1 surround sound, where available, for all subscribers (most competitors are only in stereo) and an expansion of the DVR search, which can now pick out specific sports, which is most useful for events such as the Olympics.\nWhat's it like to use?\nCompared to some services with multilevel interfaces, YouTube TV is fairly simple. There are three main tabs at the top of the interface: Library, Home and Live (on mobile, these tabs are located at the bottom). Library is where your DVR content lives, and Home is where featured and live thumbnails appear. The Live tab is a familiar-looking program grid that displays both currently playing and upcoming shows. You can search for content from the top of any page, making it relatively easy to jump straight to the programming you want. Additionally, viewers can customize the live guide with their favorite channels, or set it to be sorted alphabetically or by the most-watched channels.\nThere's also a button at the top that offers the ability to buy add-on packages and rent or buy movies within the app. A search icon allows you to type in networks or what you want to watch, and we should note that YouTube TV uses your search history for its recommendation engine. If you want, you can delete your searches.\nYou can also perform searches with a compatible voice remote or Google Assistant. This is easier if you have an Android TV streamer, you could also perform searches on your Google Nest Mini and play it on a Roku, for example.\nThe DVR works as you'd expect -- both time-shifting live content and playing back recorded shows -- and the system assigns your recorded content to manageable categories, such as recently recorded and most viewed. The DVR also includes the ability to rewind and fast-forward freely through recordings, even ones that aren't yet completed. The Roku interface offers a 15-second skip by default, while the Apple TV's control system via the Siri Remote is even better. You can use the touchpad to scroll through videos and it's glorious. It's so much fun, and auto-generated thumbnails make it relatively easy to get to the part you want.\nIn the past, when a show appeared in a network's on-demand library, it would automatically replace the version in your cloud DVR, meaning you'd lose the ability to fast-forward through commercials though Google says this should no longer occur. Additionally, YouTube TV's DVR isn't truly unlimited; the shows will expire after nine months (just like Hulu), but this is still much longer than the 30 days you get with most rivals.\nYouTube TV rolled out a multiview feature in 2023, enabling subscribers to watch up to four separate sports streams on one screen. The functionality has since been expanded to include news and weather channels with the option to watch either two or four streams at a time. It works on smart TVs as well as phones, and all you have to do is scroll to the \"Watch in Multiview\" section on the home screen.\nOn a mobile phone, the YouTube TV app operates as smoothly as the TV version. I was able to filter by channel and genre to comb through content, and the multiview feature is available on my phone as well. If your phone is connected to a smart TV or media player, you can cast YouTube TV to those devices, which can come in handy if you're watching while away from home. It's also easy to download TV show episodes and movies on the mobile app and stream them right on your phone.\nAlthough Google used to integrate YouTube into YouTube TV -- with trailers and related content on a show's About page -- this appears to no longer be the case. The company is continually tweaking the interface, and we may see YouTube content appear again at some point.\nIs it worth the $10 for 4K?\nIt depends. The $10 4K Plus upgrade could be useful if you're looking to stream 4K sporting events and on-demand programming, but the amount of content available in 4K is still limited. There is one new feature that may prove the most useful, especially for travelers, and that's the ability to view an unlimited number of simultaneous streams, and the option to save DVR recordings for offline mobile viewing. If you're a frequent flyer or subway rider, the ability to watch prerecorded shows without an active connection is an attractive feature.\nAs per YouTube TV's 4K page, the additional content includes shows from Discovery, ESPN, Fox Sports, FX, NBA TV, Nat Geo, NBC Sports and Tastemade. If you want to watch certain premium content (e.g. South Park), you may need to subscribe separately to premium add-ons for Max, Peacock and other services.\nThe interface includes a 4K button to help find content, but at present, this doesn't constitute enough to stick around for. In addition to a handful of shows, there's Thursday Night Football, \"live\" Premier League soccer and college football on ESPN. The NCAA adds a bunch of 4K content, but if you want football, 4K or a combination of the two, Fubo offers even more sports for a $90 price tag.\nThe 4K content that is available with the basic subscription, such as the cooking show Make This Tonight or the travel competition show Basic Versus Baller, does look good, with better contrast and color than regular broadcast TV. In context, the top tier of Netflix costs substantially more at $25 per month, but it offers thousands of hours of 4K content alone, plus offline viewing.\nThink of YouTube TV as a cable replacement\nWhen it originally appeared for $35, YouTube TV was an exceedingly attractive way to save money over cable. But as the service has piled on more channels, it's added further costs. When you take that $83 monthly fee and apply it to the $55 you're probably already paying for internet service, it means you're paying over $130 a month. Many cable TV providers will give you a TV and internet bundle for around the same money.\nPrices vary a lot, of course, and with cable, you probably have to pay rental equipment fees, taxes and other extras. Cable providers usually reserve the best bundle pricing for people who sign a contract. The same goes for \"streaming\" offerings, such as Comcast's StreamSaver, which can be paired with its NOW TV offering. The reason you want to cut cable in the first place remains.\nRead more here: Streaming vs. Cable: Which One Saves You More Money?\nLike Hulu with Live TV, Sling TV and others, YouTube TV is contract-free, so you can cancel anytime. Streaming services also have other advantages over cable. They're easier to watch on phones and tablets, for example. At $83 per month, you'll have to be coming from a relatively expensive cable bill to realize substantial savings with YouTube TV.\nShould you get YouTube TV?\nIf price is no object, YouTube TV goes neck and neck with Hulu Plus Live TV as the premier live TV streaming service, with a huge array of entertainment options and one of the best DVR/search combos on the market. It offers more channels than anyone else and its 5.1 surround is great for sports and movie fans. If you don't want to be beholden to a traditional cable company, it's a great alternative.\nThough $83 a month is a tough expenditure for some people, without a contract to worry about, you're free to jump ship to a better deal at any time. The extra $10 is still too much for so little 4K content, even if unlimited streams and DVR downloads are useful for extended families or travelers.

      "text": "Sling has added the ABC local channel and increased prices by $5 today for Sling TV Blue subscribers in five cities.\nWhile Sling Orange-tier customers are not affected, subscribers who have Sling Blue as part of their package in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and San Francisco will now have to pay extra but will gain access to local ABC, FOX and NBC stations.\nMeanwhile, Sling Blue and Orange-and-Blue combo users in Fresno, Houston and Raleigh will now have both ABC and FOX, but will not have to pay extra.\nSling's point of difference used to be that it offered cheaper prices than premium live services because it didn't include local channels. The company even offers optional AirTV DVRs so users can add local channels for free, so it would have been great to see the ABC add-on as optional. Even so, at $45 Sling TV Blue is still $20 less than YouTube TV, which was CNET's Editors' Choice.\nLast month, Sling TV revamped its free offering to Freestream, which also includes the ability to add premium upgrades like Showtime.\nRead more: Best Live TV Streaming Service for 2023"

      "text": "If you've been considering ways to replace cable, live TV streaming services offer a convenient method of watching cable channels without a contract. These cable replacements are streamed over the internet, but unlike on-demand services such as Netflix, they let you channel surf among the most popular live channels. For a flat monthly fee, these services offer can watch sports, news broadcasts, primetime TV shows, and we have compared all of the apps on mobile devices, streaming sticks and smart TV. Plus, as many of these services offer unlimited recordings, you can record all of your shows and watch them later.\nOur Picks\nWhile the live TV streaming available today is more sophisticated than ever, some services cost the same as the cable they are designed to replace. Indeed, pricing and channel availability are in a constant state of flux. After recent increases YouTube TV is now $83, DirecTV bumped its price up to $87, Fubo's basic package now costs $85 and Hulu Plus Live TV is now $83. Meanwhile, Fubo and Hulu have announced they would merge -- pending regulatory approval. But change is all part of the brave new world of live TV streaming over the internet. Here's what you need to know.\nWant to save even more money? See the Best Free TV Streaming Services: Plex, Pluto TV and more.\nWhat's the best live TV streaming service overall?\nWe've tested all of the popular paid live TV streaming services including Sling TV, Hulu Plus Live TV, DirecTV, Philo and Fubo. Among this competition, our top choices in this category are Hulu Plus Live TV and the budget-friendly Sling TV. At the affordable end of the spectrum, Sling's Blue package carries many basic channels for $46 a month, while Hulu's live offerings include a Disney streaming bundle for $83. Each service provides a user-friendly layout and a blend of live channels with unlimited DVRs and on-demand content. Beyond those two, all of the cancel-anytime live TV bundles we've evaluated on this list allow you to watch local and national news and live sports and events. You can stream live channels such as CNN, NBC, ESPN and Fox on a host of different devices. You can compare the services' channel lineups here.\nBest live TV streaming services of 2025\nBest for on-demand\nHulu Plus Live TV\nPros\n- Unlimited DVR\n- Inclusion of Disney Plus and Hulu on-demand content\n- Solid channel roster\nCons\n- Price hike\n- YouTube TV's channels are better\nFor people who ant the best mix of live streaming and on-demand, Hulu Plus Live TV is the best service to subscribe to. Its channel selection may not be as robust as YouTube TV, but it's almost there -- especially with the addition of PBS and Magnolia. Yet, it's Hulu's significant catalog of on-demand content that helps set it apart. Hulu's exclusive titles include Shogun and Only Murders in the Building, plus it has a massive catalog of broadcast programming, which grant it a content advantage no other service can match. The $83 service includes an unlimited DVR plus the ad-supported version of the Disney Bundle (Hulu Basic, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus), and if you want the ad-free bundle, the price is $96.\nIn terms of usability, the interface is friendly with plenty of options for content discovery, and all of the sections are clearly marked. Like most of its competition it has an unlimited DVR so there's plenty of space for any program you feel like bingeing on. The only annoyance is that if you want to record a show while you're watching it live, you need to exit to the guide to press the record button.\nIn January, Hulu announced it was merging with Fubo in a deal which would end the litigation between the two companies over the Venu Sports streaming service. The merger is subject to regulatory approval and no official date has yet been set.\nGiven that Hulu Plus Live TV offers you more with its live channels, namely a whole bunch of on-demand content, it's currently the service to choose for live TV streaming.\nTop channels not available on Hulu Plus Live TV: AMC, BBC America and NBA TV.\nBest cable alternative\nYouTube TV\nPros\n- More channels than competitors\n- Excellent on-screen interface and handy search bar\n- Great cloud DVR\nCons\n- $20 upgrade doesn't include much 4K content\n- On the pricier side\nYouTube TV has more top channels than any competitor at this price, and it was the first service to include local PBS stations -- Hulu and DirecTV Stream followed suit later. Despite a $10 price hike in January 2025, YouTube TV service has an excellent cloud DVR, including both unlimited storage and a generous nine months to watch recordings (most rivals offer 30 days).\nThe user interface is no-nonsense, though it has had a little spruce-up of late, and is now easier to use than ever. The service it offers most of the features a cable service can give you include time shifting and it is also the only one to offer surround sound on live broadcasts.\nYouTube TV is the exclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticket through the 2029-2030 season, with monthly payment plans available. In addition, the video streaming service has a $20 monthly upgrade that lets you watch a limited number of 4K livestreams, download DVR recordings to your devices and watch an unlimited number of simultaneous streams (up from three).\nWhile Hulu throws in Disney for the same money, and Sling TV is even cheaper, YouTube TV is still worth subscribing to if you want a tightly integrated search and a great channel selection.\nTop channels not available on YouTube TV: A&E, History, Lifetime and MLB\nPros\n- Excellent value with decent channel selection\n- Numerous choices and add-ons\n- Optional AirTV 2 tuner for local channels\nCons\n- No local channels beyond ABC, NBC and Fox in a few cities\n- Limited DVR\n- AirTV channels don't work on browsers or Apple TV\nIf you're looking for the cheapest live TV streaming service, and one that is still able to offer a usable amount of channels, then it's without a doubt Sling TV Blue. Yet, things are a little more complicated than they are for Sling's competitors. You see, Sling tenders two different $45-ish-per-month live TV streaming channel packages, Sling Orange and Sling Blue. While a number of live TV channels are common to both, Orange is essentially the ESPN/Disney package, while Blue is the Fox/Discovery package. Meanwhile, Orange & Blue combines the two offerings for $61.\nIn 2023, Sling added ABC to eight markets and you now pay $46 a month regardless of whether you receive one local channel or three. As a result, Sling TV costs up to $20 more than Philo, yet it still has better channels, more options and a comparatively better live TV streaming interface. Sling is also cheaper than most other streaming services, let alone cable, but it is a little hampered by its 50 hour DVR cap while most competitors have unlimited recordings. You can add Unlimited DVR to Sling for an extra $5 a month.\nWhile Sling doesn't have a free trial, though it is currently offering half price for the first month, but it does offer a cut-down version called Freestream with a number of included channels.\nTop channels not available on Sling Blue: CBS, Animal Planet, Disney Channel, ESPN and Nickelodeon. ABC, Fox and NBC are available in select markets.\nTop channels not available on Sling Orange: ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Animal Planet, Bravo, CNBC, Discovery Channel, Bravo, Fox News, Fox Sports 1, FX, MSNBC and USA Network.\nPros\n- Good for channel surfers\n- Offers most regional sports networks on higher tier\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Not as many non-sports channels as competitors\nDIrecTV, formerly known as DirecTV Stream, is the most expensive service at $87, but it does have some pluses, including the flipper-friendly ability to swipe left and right to change channels. The service also offers unlimited DVR capability to new users, while existing subscribers need to pay an extra $10 a month.\nDirecTV recently announced its Genre Packs, starting at $35, which slim down channel offerings into compact packages. These are MySports for $70 a month, MyEntertainment (which includes more than 40 channels, such as Food and FX), MyNews and MiEspa\u00f1ol. Subscribers can add Mini Packs to these, which include sports and movies.\nFor cord-cutters who want to follow their local NBA or MLB team, DirecTV's $130 Choice package is a competitive live TV sports pick, because it has access to more regional sports networks than the competition. Additionally, DirecTV includes channels some other services can't, including almost 250 local PBS stations.\nTop channels not available in base package: MLB Network, NFL Network and Travel Channel.\nWatch live and on-demand TV from 100-plus top channels, including sports and news. Stream full seasons of exclusive series, hit movies, current episodes, Hulu Originals and more on Hulu, along with endless entertainment on Disney Plus and live sports on ESPN Plus.\nHow we test live TV streaming services\nWe have ordered these services based on the score each streaming service received in their individual review, and based on a number of criteria including the number of platforms, ease of use, features, cost and channels. We test each service's apps on multiple platforms including Android, iOS, Apple TV, Google TV and internet browsers, and note whenever features aren't available on some of them.\nDesign: We take into account the design of the service including its ease of use, and the layout of the program guide -- for example, how easy it it to find the content you want, or to record a show?\nContent: A live TV streaming service is only as good as the channels it offers, and we take into account the number of popular channels it supports. We also note any sports offerings, add-on packages, plus the quality of originals and back catalog content.\nValue: In terms of price, there are three tiers of live TV streaming services: free, budget and premium. While we cover free services here, the budget tier includes services like Philo and Sling TV, while the premium services like YouTube TV cost from $80 and up. We try to balance the other factors such as content and features, and how much they correlate to your \"bang for buck.\"\nFeatures: We pay special attention to features like 4K HDR, DVR and number of multiple streams, as well as unique features such as DirecTV's \"channel flipping\" mechanic which helps the service feel more cable like.\nLive TV streaming services we also tested\n- Philo: This $28 live TV streaming service offers a variety of channels, but it lacks sports channels, local stations and big-name news networks -- although Cheddar and BBC news are available. Philo offers bread-and-butter cable staples like AMC, Comedy Channel, Nickelodeon and Magnolia Network (formerly DIY), and specializes in lifestyle and reality programming. It now includes an unlimited cloud DVR and optional add-ons from Epix and Starz. We think most people are better off paying extra for Sling TV's superior service, but if Philo has every channel you want, it's a decent deal. Read our Philo review.\n- Fubo: There's a lot to like about Fubo -- it offers a wide selection of channels, and its sports focus makes it especially attractive to football fans of all kinds. For NFL in particular, it's one of three services, alongside YouTube TV and Hulu, with NFL Network and optional RedZone. In addition, it's also suited to NBA, NHL and MLB fans who live in an area served by one of Fubo's RSNs. The biggest hole in Fubo's lineup is the lack of Turner networks, including CNN, TNT and TBS -- especially since the latter two carry a lot of sports content. Those missing channels and the 2024 price bump that increased plans by $5 (plus additional RSN fees) make it less attractive than YouTube TV or Hulu for most viewers. Read our Fubo review here, and catch up on Fubo's merger with Hulu here.\nWhile you are most likely familiar with the services on this list, it's not fully reflective of every live TV platform available. If you're looking for free TV there are a number of services, while OTA (over the air) is also available if you hang an antenna.\nBest live TV streaming services\nFactors to consider for cord-cutting live TV services\nIf you want a cable-like experience at home and for on-the-go devices, without the dead weight that a cable subscription brings, a streaming service is worth a look. There's no contract to sign, and if you don't like the service you're on, you can easily switch. Whether you're looking for a basic package such as Sling TV or want to pay more for a deluxe experience from the likes of Hulu Plus Live TV, there should be a live TV streaming service to suit you. Here's some questions to help you get started:\n- Does the service offer your \"must-have\" channels? See CNET's comparison of the top 100 channels here.\n- Does it offer local channels in your area?\n- How good is the cloud DVR?\n- Does the interface make it easy to browse for shows?\n- Are there enough simultaneous streams for you and your family?\n- Is your internet connection up to snuff? See CNET's guide to improving streaming quality here.\nChannels: Each of the TV streaming services above offers a different mix of channels, so your first step should be choosing one that carries your \"can't miss\" cable channels and shows. Some of the most important live channels are local, namely ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. Not every service offers all of them in every area, but the best streaming service for you will include the majority of what you love to watch, so it's worth shopping around.\nThe live TV streaming service lineups are in constant flux as networks scramble to secure access to popular channels (ones with highly watched original shows and regional sports networks are especially in demand). There's also the chance that a certain cable channel could disappear from a certain service after a network contract expires, which is what happened in 2020 with the regional sports networks.\nThese negotiations lead to other changes, too. Over the past few years, YouTube TV, Sling TV, Hulu (multiple times), Philo and DirecTV have all raised their prices. Google and Roku resolved a contract dispute that prevented their users from downloading the YouTube TV app, but they lost Disney channels for two days due to a different dispute. Adding to this volatility is the fact that sometimes less popular services are simply phased out -- AT&T TV Watch TV, TVision and PlayStation Vue are just three examples.\nPrice: Broadly, each of these streaming services can be broken down into two main groups: budget, with prices ranging between $25 and $50 and few or no local channels; and premium, with prices from $80 and up, and local channels and supercharged cloud DVRs. That's right, all of the services allow you to record and playback shows, just like a traditional cable or satellite DVR, but they often come with restrictions.\nNumber of simultaneous users: If you want to watch more than one program at the same time -- for example, on your living room TV and on a bedroom TV, or the main TV and a tablet or other devices -- you'll want to make sure the video streaming service you're watching has enough simultaneous streams. Sling Orange only allows one stream at a time, and if you try to watch a second, it's blocked. Other services have higher simultaneous stream limits.\nKeep in mind that, especially if you do have more than one person watching at once on supported devices, you need to make sure you have fast, reliable broadband internet. A 100Mbps download service will cost around $50 to $60 a month, and sadly that's where the savings of cutting cable can get swallowed up.\nReasons not to choose streaming TV services\nStreaming TV services are great, but there are some things they can't do compared with a traditional cable box. First, it's worth looking at the channels that you can't get with any of these live TV streaming services. For example, only there of the services are currently able to offer PBS: YouTube TV and DirecTV and Hulu Plus Live TV\nWith sports, fans want to make sure they can find the sports channels to follow their teams. Most services carry ESPN and local channels for NFL football, but if you follow a professional baseball or basketball team, you might need its specific channel -- called a regional sports network or RSN -- to watch regular season games. RSN coverage varies widely for each service. Sometimes, even if you live in the right area, you may be mistakenly blacked out due to an IP address error. If this is the case, you can fix this by signing up for a sports-friendly VPN.\nEvery live TV service's video streaming is a few seconds to a minute or more behind the \"live\" stream you'll get from your local cable TV or satellite provider. That means you could get a preview of scores or big plays from Twitter, phone alerts or calls from friends slightly before you see the action on screen.\nIf you're used to 5.1-channel surround offered by cable or even OTA, then you may be disappointed that YouTube is the only service to offer surround sound on live broadcasts. The other services include stereo sound only on live channels, though 5.1 audio is available on some on-demand material."
