  "description": "Bryan Abreu's 58th appearance of the season, coming a day after throwing more than one inning, is a symbol of the Astros' seismic problem.",
  "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 Down the bullpen stairs came Bryan Abreu, perhaps the most indispensable piece of this injury-plagued pitching staff. He passed a foreign-substance inspection and sauntered into a game he never should\u2019ve appeared in, one the Houston Astros led by five runs before their starter threw a pitch.\n\nOne evening earlier, the Astros had a four-run advantage after four innings. They still turned to Abreu in search of the final four outs. He threw 21 pitches to secure them. Rarely is a reliever available the day after throwing more than one inning, but here came Abreu on Saturday night, his 58th appearance of the season a symbol of the Astros\u2019 seismic problem.\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d manager Joe Espada said afterward, \u201cI\u2019m doing the math, and I keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\nEspada managed with the urgency a division race mandates. Abreu is his closer in Josh Hader\u2019s absence, even after the addition of nine-time All-Star Craig Kimbrel. The Astros clung to a one-run lead. Summoning Abreu to protect it is sensible.\n\nWhether it is sustainable will define the final 32 games of Houston\u2019s season, one with championship aspirations a suspect starting rotation could put in peril. Abreu needed just nine pitches to save Saturday\u2019s 9-8 win, but that he even threw is the byproduct of a bigger problem.\n\nAcross the past two games, Houston\u2019s suddenly slugging offense offered its starting pitchers nine runs of support. Lance McCullers Jr. collected six outs after being staked to a four-run lead Friday. Cristian Javier conducted an encore Saturday, squandering a five-run advantage the Astros built before he even threw a pitch.\n\nThese are the starting pitchers proclaimed as akin to trade deadline acquisitions. Steep asking prices scared Astros officials from obtaining any actual additions last month, so they settled for the same worn sentiment spouted by every empty-handed front office. Getting Javier, McCullers and Spencer Arrighetti back from the injured list would feel like an acquisition in and of itself.\n\nClinging to that cliche is causing a crisis, one that presents the most tangible threat to the Astros\u2019 pursuit of an American League West title. Houston\u2019s idea of a fortified rotation is faltering at a fateful time when every game is magnified and the runway shortens for a potential turnaround.\n\nSolace can \u2014 and should \u2014 be taken in the final results. The Astros won both games with offensive breakouts, scoring 19 runs against a Baltimore pitching staff that boasts baseball\u2019s fourth-highest ERA. Five of those runs came as a direct result of fielding errors committed by a Baltimore Orioles team that orchestrated a trade deadline fire sale earlier this month. Houston is inflicting the sort of damage it should, but this is nowhere near the level of play it will see from teams in October.\n\nStill, for a team propelled here by run prevention, seeing the Astros offense support its struggling pitching staff is encouraging. Houston has 16 extra-base hits across the past three games. Christian Walker has whacked a home run in all of them, including a tiebreaking two-run shot in the seventh inning Saturday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re picking each other up,\u201d Espada said.\n\nThat this game even required Walker\u2019s heroics reveals the bigger problem. Houston hit three first-inning home runs against Baltimore starter Dean Kremer, staking Javier to a five-run lead before throwing a pitch. By the time Baltimore\u2019s 12th batter came to the plate, Javier had given it away.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t very consistent in keeping the ball in the strike zone,\u201d Javier said through an interpreter. \u201cEverything is good (physically). I just wasn\u2019t attacking the zone today.\u201d\n\nJavier underwent Tommy John surgery 14 months ago. Expecting an instant return to his peak form is foolish, a fact Espada echoed Saturday night and the sport widely recognizes. The Miami Marlins, for example, are encountering the same struggles with Sandy Alcantara.\n\n\u201cIt just takes time,\u201d Espada said. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good pitcher. He will be that really good pitcher that we\u2019ve seen in the past; it just takes some time. We have to be patient. I have to be patient because we have leaned on this guy before, and we\u2019re going to lean on him again.\u201d\n\nPatience should have no place in a pennant race, but by failing to acquire any pitching at the trade deadline, the Astros have accepted it as their way forward. It may be dramatic to place an entire club\u2019s fate on the right arms of Javier, McCullers and Arrighetti, yet it is becoming clearer that no three players will be more crucial in how this season ends.\n\nArrighetti became the first of the trio to return, on Aug. 6. Since that date, Houston\u2019s starters have a 4.71 ERA. Only 12 rotations entered Saturday with a higher one across that same stretch. Just two bullpens awoke Saturday with more innings pitched than the 64 1/3 frames Astros relievers have thrown in that time frame.\n\nArrighetti, McCullers and Javier have combined to make seven starts since the trade deadline. None has thrown a pitch in the sixth inning. The trio has surrendered 21 earned runs across 27 2/3 frames, teaming for a 6.83 ERA while tearing apart an injury-ravaged bullpen that can ill afford such overuse.\n\nHouston must hope Javier\u2019s start Saturday served as a nadir. He collected six outs, surrendered five runs (three earned) and walked four batters. Walker\u2019s throwing error in the second inning didn\u2019t help matters, but to blame this on anyone but Javier is disingenuous.\n\nJavier threw 65 pitches. Six were called strikes. Baltimore swung 33 times and spoiled 15 of those pitches foul. Javier, who fell ill during his start last Sunday, saw his velocity return to standard numbers but failed to command any of his arsenal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s usually a guy that\u2019s in the zone,\u201d Espada said. \u201cHe\u2019s always getting guys to swing the bat because they know he comes after you with the fastball. We\u2019re not getting that right now. But, eventually, we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\nThirty-two games remain to reach it. Sunday will offer another step. Arrighetti will start for the fourth time since coming off the injured list, offering another test in patience for a team that could soon run out of it.",
