  "description": "The Times Union spoke with several homeless men in Auburn, NY who say Slater\u2019s campaign offered them $30 to sign paperwork saying they donated $250. This way, Slater\u2019s campaign could receive funds \u2026",
  "content": "ALBANY \u2013 An upstate GOP state senate candidate\u2019s campaign allegedly paid homeless people to claim they made donations to him, allowing him to net matching taxpayer funds, a report says.\n\nSeveral homeless men in Auburn told the Albany Times Union in a story published Friday that Caleb Slater\u2019s campaign offered them $30 a pop to sign paperwork saying they donated $250 to his run in November.\n\nThis way, Slater, who ultimately lost his bid for office, could allegedly receive public funds from the state that match contributions up to $250, the paper noted.\n\nAt least seven people who spoke to the outlet say they never contributed to Slater\u2018s campaign but were paid to submit contribution forms. One man said he was asked to recruit other straw donors as well.\n\nA photo apparently taken during the campaign and shared with The Post also seems to show someone with Slater\u2018s campaign posted at a table on a street corner with a sign offering to give people free $25 Visa gift cards in exchange for $10, which would be illegal under state campaign finance rules.\n\nSlater\u2019s campaign ultimately netted $22,000 from the state public financing system before he was trounced by incumbent Democratic state Sen. Rachel May (D-Onondaga) in the general election. May won with 58% of the vote.\n\nSlater did not respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBut he first told the Times Union that its reporting was \u201cinaccurate.\n\n\u201cYour facts are incorrect,\u201d he texted the outlet. \u201cAt this time, I have nothing to say.\u201d\n\nHe then followed up by telling the outlet that he was contacting the Public Campaign Finance Board, saying, \u201cWithin these questions are statements that I am learning of for the first time.\u201d\n\nA rep for the state Board of Elections declined to confirm the existence of a possible investigation into the campaign to The Post.\n\n\u201cThe [Public Campaign Finance Board] has a number of audit and anti-fraud measures in place, and the PCFB enforcement unit is proud to work alongside law enforcement agencies to ensure any alleged violations are treated seriously,\u201d a board rep only said.\n\nState Sen. George Borrello, who leads the senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, told The Post, \u201cCaleb Slater was never endorsed by the Senate Republican Campaign Committee or any of our members.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the primary voters did not vote our way. He received no resources from us even after the primary.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s elections were the first cycle in which New York provided funds to candidates based on small-dollar donations.",

      "text": "Big Tech workers top donations to Mamdani campaign in headache for Google, Meta\nBig Tech workers, including from Google and Meta, were among the biggest group of donors to Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral campaign \u2014 creating a fresh headache for companies in the Big Apple that could feel the brunt of the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist\u2019s policies, The Post has learned.\nThe 33-year-old upstart has spooked New York business and tech leaders \u2014 many of whom fear that his vow to raise taxes on the wealthy and past calls to defund the police will spark a mass exodus similar to what San Francisco experienced under progressive leaders in recent years.\nHowever, their underlings have thrown their financial support behind the front-runner for City Hall.\nRank-and-file Google employees donated nearly $40,500 to Mamdani\u2019s campaign through July 11 \u2014 more than any other company or institution, according to NYC campaign finance data reviewed by The Post.\nMeta workers chipped in more than $10,500, ranking seventh on the list, followed by Amazon employees, who donated nearly $9,000.\nCampaign funds also flowed in from employees at New York City mainstays like tech and media firm Bloomberg ($8,816), Spotify ($7,415), Block ($6,265), Squarespace ($3,957) and MongoDB ($3,900), the data showed.\nOutside of the tech sector, Mamdani received significant support from workers at NY-based colleges and city agencies. The Columbia University system ranked second overall with nearly $33,000 in donations, followed by the NYC Department of Education ($26,214), the New York University system ($24,331) and the CUNY system ($18,336), the data showed.\nNew York City\u2019s campaign finance regulations require donors to disclose their employer if their contributions exceed $100. The stats do not include donors who listed alternate designations, such as being unemployed, self-employed or retired.\nOverall, Mamdani raised $816,014 from roughly 10,500 donors from June 25 through July 11, with more than $350,000 of that cash coming from outside New York, records show.\nRepresentatives for Google and Meta declined to comment. Amazon and the Mamdani campaign did not return requests for comment.\nJohn Borthwick, a famed tech investor and CEO of NY-based Betaworks, said the donations from tech workers \u201cdoesn\u2019t surprise me at all\u201d because \u201cyoung people in particular want change.\u201d\nMamdani, who handily beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, has vowed to lower the cost of living through policy proposals that include free public buses, a freeze on regulated rents, universal child care starting at 6 weeks old and a pilot program for city-run grocery stores.\nCrtics say his plans could cause chaos in the housing market, among other unwanted side effects \u2014 including businesses running for the exits.\nTech giants are particularly focused on the quality-of-life impacts of Mamdani\u2019s policies on issues like public safety, housing and education because those are key to making the city an attractive destination.\nCompanies left San Francisco in droves due to rampant crime and homelessness, which some critics attributed to \u201cwoke\u201d policies adopted by city leadership.\nDrew Oetting, president of tech-focused venture firm 8VC, described San Francisco in 2022 as \u201cprobably the worst run city in the United States,\u201d while Elon Musk quipped in 2023 that the city looked \u201cpost-apocalyptic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we saw when tech companies fled San Francisco \u2014 that was not because of tech policy,\u201d said Julie Samuels, president and CEO of the influential industry group Tech:NYC.\n\u201cThat was because of what was going on in San Francisco.\u201d\nInsiders say companies are struggling to balance the need to voice real concerns about the impact a Mamdani administration would have on their businesses against the risk of alienating progressive workers who appear to be broadly supportive of him.\nCompanies like Google \u2014 which last year fired more than two dozen far-left employees who staged a sit-in protest at its New York City office over its cloud-computing contracts with Israel \u2014 could face further disruptions if they are seen as overly critical of Mamdani, who has made anti-Israel remarks.\nBut workplace drama is just one concern at a time when tech firms are spending billions of dollars to lure the best possible talent as they race to develop advanced artificial intelligence and other burgeoning products.\n\u201cTech companies historically do a really great job of, frankly, catering to their employees,\u201d Samuels said. \u201cA lot of tech leaders are not wanting to alienate themselves from their employee base.\u201d\nSome of New York\u2019s tech and business leaders have publicly struck a cautiously optimistic tone about Mamdani\u2019s candidacy. Last month, Partnership for New York City hosted a pair of summits with the Queens assemblyman \u2014 one aimed at executives across various industries and one specifically focused on the outlook for tech.\nWhile the Partnership and Tech:NYC described the latter meeting as \u201clively and productive,\u201d other business leaders have been far less accommodating.\nMamdani\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence is a \u201ckey concern\u201d for Borthwick, who noted that the upstart has yet to articulate a vision on how New York City should leverage a technology that carries major potential but also threatens to cause significant upheaval in the white-collar workforce.\n\u201cThis technology is going to transform the city and he isn\u2019t thinking or ready for it,\u201d said Borthwick, who previously told The Post that a Mamdani mayorship would be \u201cdisastrous for the city.\u201d\nMamdani has vowed to regulate the industry, warning that AI could \u201charm workers, replicate biases, and weaken vital services if done irresponsibly.\u201d\n\u201cWe must ultimately create checks to ensure that technological tools are being deployed responsibly to deliver effective services,\u201d Mamdani told Crain\u2019s New York. \u201cAs mayor, I would work with unions and the City Council to pass legislation to appropriately regulate AI.\u201d\nMamdani has tried to take the edge off his more radical stances \u2014 including publicly backing off his past support for defunding the police.\nAt the same time, he has rankled some executives over his refusal to outwardly condemn the phrase \u201cGlobalize the intifada,\u201d which is widely seen as antisemitic.\nLocal tech leaders are hoping that Mamdani \u2014 or whoever ultimately wins the mayoral race \u2014 will take a more open-minded approach to AI\u2019s potential benefits while also preparing for its risks, according to Samuels.\n\u201cI absolutely would hope that the next mayor would be open to experimentation, would be open to using these modern tools to make New York work better,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cIf our elected officials come in only worrying about the negative first, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see real change in the way that the city uses technology.\u201d"

McGreevey: new poll\nJersey City\u2019s mayoral race is neck and neck as local Councilman James Solomon has made double-digit gains on former Gov. Jim McGreevey in the past year, a new poll shows.\nSolomon gained 10 points on McGreevey between August 2024 and July 2025, jumping from 16% to 26% in winning over voters, according to the Impact Research poll shared with The Post by Solomon\u2019s camp.\nMcGreevey, on the other hand, dropped a point during that time \u2014 landing him with 27% of the vote as of August.\nThat makes the race for Jersey City\u2019s leadership a 1-point game between the two Democratic candidates among decided voters just months ahead of the November election.\nAbout 22% of voters remains undecided, the poll found.\n\u201cThe reason James Solomon is rising in the polls and is going to win this election while others stall is simple: This is a change election, and James is the only real change candidate,\u201d Solomon\u2019s campaign manager, Stuart Thomas, told The Post.\n\u201cJames has run a campaign laser-focused on the issues that matter to Jersey City, housing affordability, cost of living, and creating a better quality of life for everyone, and we\u2019re going to keep hammering that from now until November,\u201d he added.\nSolomon\u2019s name recognition has also soared in the past year, the poll found \u2014 with 73% of voters knowing his name as of August, compared to 45% the year before.\nMcGreevey\u2019s scandal-plagued past has dogged him since he announced his run in 2023, with the poll finding his favorability among voters split almost evenly. About 43% of respondents said they look on him favorably, with 44% viewing him as unfavorable.\nThe former governor\u2019s mayoral bid marked a return to politics since he resigned from leading New Jersey in 2004 after he was caught having an extramarital affair with a male staffer.\nJersey City\u2019s incumbent mayor, Steven Fulop declined to run for re-election in favor of a gubernatorial bid."

      "text": "Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe dies after campaign shooting in June\nMiguel Uribe, a Colombian senator who was vying for his party\u2019s candidacy in upcoming presidential elections, died on Monday, two months after being shot at a campaign rally. He was 39.\nUribe, a father and stepfather, was shot in the head while giving a campaign speech on June 7 and underwent multiple surgeries during his subsequent hospital stay.\nHe had shown some improvement during July, but his condition worsened over the past weekend due to a hemorrhage in his central nervous system, the hospital treating him said on Sunday.\nThe assassination has evoked memories of intense political violence in Colombia\u2019s past. In the 1980s and 1990s, four presidential candidates were murdered in separate attacks blamed on drug cartels allied with right-wing paramilitary death squads.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always be the love of my life,\u201d his wife Maria Claudia Tarazona said on Instagram early on Monday. \u201cThank you for a life filled with love, thank you for being a father to the girls, the best dad to Alejandro.\u201d\n\u201cI ask God to show me the path to learn to live without you,\u201d she added. \u201cRest in peace, love of my life, I will take care of our children.\u201d\nThe death of Uribe adds further tragedy to his family\u2019s fraught history.\nHis mother, journalist Diana Turbay, was killed in 1991 during a botched rescue mission after she was kidnapped by the Medellin Cartel, headed by drug lord Pablo Escobar.\nThe family is prominent in Colombian politics. His maternal grandfather, Julio Cesar Turbay, served as Colombia\u2019s president from 1978 to 1982, while his paternal grandfather, Rodrigo Uribe Echavarria, headed the Liberal Party and supported Virgilio Barco\u2019s successful 1986 presidential campaign.\n\u2018WITHOUT SECURITY, THERE IS NOTHING\u2019\n\u201cColombia needs leadership, unity and work. Peace cannot be reached through impunity,\u201d Uribe told fellow lawmakers in July 2024, on the opening day of the legislative session. \u201cOnly a serious security policy will incentivize criminals to lay down their arms and submit to the law.\u201d\n\u201cWithout security there is nothing. Prosperity is reached through opportunities and opportunities with investment, but for there to be investment there need to be clear rules, incentives,\u201d he added.\nUribe himself has enjoyed a rapid political rise, becoming a recognized lawmaker for the right-wing Democratic Center party and presidential hopeful known for his sharp criticism of leftist President Gustavo Petro\u2019s administration.\nAt 25, he was elected to Bogota\u2019s city council, where he was a prominent opponent of Petro, then the capital\u2019s mayor, criticizing Petro\u2019s handling of waste management and social programs.\nIn 2016, at 30, Uribe was appointed city government secretary, the youngest person to hold the position.\nHe resigned from that post in 2018 to launch an unsuccessful bid for mayor of Bogota as an independent.\nIn the 2022 legislative elections, Uribe led the Senate slate for the Democratic Center party with the slogan \u201cColombia First,\u201d winning a seat in the chamber.\nThere, Uribe cemented his role as one of the primary opposition voices to Petro, criticizing the government\u2019s peace strategy aimed at ending Colombia\u2019s six-decade armed conflict. Uribe said the strategy had backfired, as the government had paused offensives on armed groups as peace talks failed.\nHe had been running to be chosen as the candidate for the Democratic Center in the 2026 presidential election.\nFormer President Alvaro Uribe, leader of the Democratic Center party and no relation to the deceased senator, called Miguel Uribe \u201ca hope for the homeland.\u201d"
