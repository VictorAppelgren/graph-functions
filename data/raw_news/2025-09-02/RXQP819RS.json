  "description": "Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde discusses US plans to revoke waivers granted to Samsung and SK Hynix that authorized them to move some equipment from China without a license. Plus, Dell and Marvell shares fall after earnings disappointments. And, US regulators are embracing the blockchain and SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda discusses the agency\u2019s crypto-friendly steps. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": ". \"BLOOMBERG TECH\" IS LIVE FROM COAST TO COAST WITH CAROLINE HYDE AND ED LUDLOW. CAROLINE: WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LATEST FROM BEIJING\u2019S TECH SECTOR. A.I. SPEND ING AND WE HEAR ABOUT THE DECISION FOR CRYPTO LATER THIS HOUR. FIRST WE CHECK IN ON THE MARKETS WHICH ARE BROADLY UNDER PRESSURE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT NOT CHINA THEY ARE UP 1.3% BEER QUESTIONING THE A.I. STRUCTURE AND WITH WE HEARD FROM NVIDIA. BUT I\u2019M LOOKING AT THE REFLECTION OF BIG TECH IN CHINA. WE UNDERSTAND THEIR TECH STOCK IS BEGINNING TO FLOURISH. WE WANT TO SEE THE U.S. NUMBERS ON THE BACK OF WORRIES FOR NVIDIA UP BY 3.5% BUT NEWS THAT THEY LOOKING AT CHIPS MADE BY CHINESE MANUFACTURING AND WE HAVE THE STORY OF MARVEL UP BY 17% AS WE SEE CONCERNS WITH ITS OWN DEMAND AND HOW WITH WE SEEING THEIR CHIP, DELL UP BY 8% AND THAT IS WHERE WE TGO FIRST THEY WERE LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER. > > IF WE THINK OF THE TIMING OF THESE DEALS THERE IS ONE DILL THAT WENT IN AND IT IS UNCLEAR WHO BUT IT IS ONE OF THE NEO CLOUD VENDORS SO IT WILL BE DOWN BUT WE THINK OF IT IS 10 BILLION EVEN SECOND HALF VERSUS FIRST HALF SO THINGS ARE GOING WELL FOR DELL. CAROLINE: THINGS ARE GOING WELL BUT NUMBERS ARE UP TO THE RIGHT. WHAT IS IT THAT INVESTORS NEED TO HERE OR CLARITY AND MARGINS IN TECHNIQUE WITH THE COMPETITION. > > THAT IS WHY THE ISSUE IS. YOU CAN A LEADER IN A.I. SERVERS IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD. WHAT YOU GET IN SALES YOU ARE NOT GETTING IN MARGINS. LET ME GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE. ONLY IN THE IN A 2% AND THAT WILL FLOW THROUGH WITH MODEST IMPROVEMENT WITH THE ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION IN THE SECOND HALF. CAROLINE: LET\u2019S GO NOW TO THE 5. I. THE COMMERCE KEPT SAID IT IS REMOVING TO MOVE SOME GOODS FROM CHINA WITHOUT A LICENSE TO MORE WE WILL BREAK IT DOWN. IT IS REVOKING WAIVERERS TO BRING IN CHIP EQUIPMENT IT THE COUNTRY? > > THAT\u2019S CORRECT. THE COMPANIES HAVE RECEIVED WAIVERS FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IN 2023 TWO BRING IN EQUIPMENT TO CLINIC FOR THE PMASSIVE CHIP MAKING FACILITIES AND WHAT WAS MOSTLY WAS S.K. AND SAMSUNG IN PARTICULAR IN THIS CASE. IT IS UNDER A SRAPLD DATED END USER AGREEMENT. THAT IS LIKE YOUR PASS LIKE YOU GET A FREE PASS BASED ON THIS AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING AN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. THAT IS BEING REVOKED. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IS SAYING ACCOMPANYING THE NOTICE POSITIONED TO THE FEDERAL REGISTERED WHAT THEY ARE TRYING DO IS DENY TO FOREIGN CHIP MANUFACTURERS A BENEFIT THAT REALLY WASN\u2019T EXTENDED TO AMERICAN CHIP MANUFACTURERS. INTEL HAS SOLD THAT PORTION TO S.K. SO IT APPLIES TO ONLY THE TWO SOUTH KOREAN CONDITIONS. CAROLINE: IN THE STATEMENT THEY DO NOT WANT TO ALLOW THEM TO GRAY TECHNOLOGY AT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES THE SHARES ARE DOWN AND ACCELERATING THE LOSSES A BIG CHIP EQUIPMENT MAKER. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE OVERARCHING COMPETITION THE U.S. FEELS WITH CHINA. > > AND THERE IS PUSH AND PULL ON TRADE WITH OTHER TRADING PARTNERS. YOU THINK OF SOUTH KOREA THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA WAS IN WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH DONALD TRUMP AND THE QUESTION WITH ABOUT THE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA THE QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS AND HOW SEMICONDUCTOR TARIFFS MIGHT AFFECT THESE TWO IF SOUTH KOREA YOU THINK OF THEM THEY ARE AT THE VANGUARD OF THE ECONOMY AND THAT HAD TO COME UP IN COME TEXT WITH THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION AND BEEF HEARD SINCE FROM THE SOUTH KOREA MINISTER OF TRADE THEY WERE WARNED AHEAD OF TIME BY U.S. OFFICIALS THIS WOULD BE COMING DOWN THE ROAD. IN YOU PARSE THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT STATEMENT THEY WON\u2019T BE GRANTING LICENSES TO CHINA OR UPGRADE OR EXPAND CAPACITY BUT IT DOESN\u2019T PRECLUDE MAINTENANCE OR REPLACING EXISTING EQUIPMENT. SO IT IS INTERESTING HOW IT AFFECTS THESE COMPETITORS AND THE IMPACT ON THE BROADER TRADE RELATIONSHIP WILL BE WORTH WATCHING. HUAWEI HAVE EXPANDED A STRUCTURED TO MORE ON A.I. AND COMPUTING ACCORDING TO CHINESE. ALI BABA REPORTS FROM THE A.I. BOOM BUT WILL IT LAST. AND HOW THEY ARE TALKING WITH B. KWR B B.Y.D. OFF BY 7%. THE PROFIT ROCKED AS THE PRICE WAR IS HITTING. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" CAROLINE: A LOT OF NEWS OUT OF ASIA CLOG CHINA\u2019S WARNING ABOUT THE A.I. RACE AND TWO INVESTORS IN THE STOCK AS ALL BABA WANT OF THE BIGGEST NAMES REPORTED EARNINGS THAT IS A SURGE IN REVENUE BUT IT IS FROM THE AMOUNT PLT BOOM. WE CAN READ INTO NARRATIVE. IT DID INCREDIBLY WELL BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON THE BACK OF THE A.I. > > IT WAS A PRETTY UNUSUAL REPORT WE JUST GOT THE NUMBERS THEY MISSED ON BOTH REVENUE AND PROFIT IN THAT CASE YOU EXPECT THE SHARES TO GO DOWN BUT WHAT THEY SAW POSITIVE IS INCREASE IN A.I. AND CLOUD SERVICES. SO ALI BABA SAID THEY WOULD INCREASE BY TRB DIGITS AND 26% AND EARNINGS CALL THE C.E.O. TALKED ABOUT HOW CUSTOMERS ARE USING A.I. AND THEY TALKED ABOUT AUTO MAKERS, MULTI MMEDIA COMPANIES MAKING MODELS TO USE IN EXPANSION AND THE MOVE FROM CHATBOTS AND PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE AMAZON AND THAT RESULTED IN A LOT OF DEMAND. AS WE ARE TALKING I SEE THE SHARES ARE UP EVEN MORE. CAROLINE: 8% ON THE DAY. THEIR REPORT FROM THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" THEY ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON MAKING THEIR CUSTOMIZED CHIPS AND THE MARKET VALUATION DOUBLE IN A MONTH IS WARNING TO HOLD STEADY ON HOW MUCH CHINA IS LEANING INTO THE DOMESTIC OF DOMESTIC CHIP. HOW MUCH IS CHINA WORRIED ABOUT THAT. > > THERE\u2019S A LOT GOING ON. MAYBE A GOOD WAY TO THINK BEIJING IS DETERMINE TO GET THEIR A.I. AND SEMICONDUCTORS IN PARTICULAR. HUAWEI IS MOVING TO GET THE CHIPS TO COMPETE WITH INVIDHYA. THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD AS NVIDIA\u2019S. ANOTHER COMPANY IS DESIGNING THEM FOR A.I. THAT ARE QUITE GOOD AND THEY ARE RUNNING THE MODELS NOT AS MUCH TRAINING THEM WHICH IS WHAT NVIDIA. AND ALI BABA IS DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CHAMPIONSHIPS SIMILAR TO AMAZON WHY THEY DON\u2019T WANT TO PAY THE PREMIUM THEY WANT TO DESIGN THEM AND REPLACE SOME OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHIPS THEY WOULD GET FROM HUAWEI AND PAYING 3R50E78 THEN ALTERNATIVES LESS EXPENSIVE AND LESSEN THE DEPENDENCE ON CHIPMAKERS AND NOT MAKE THEM CAPTIVE. CAROLINE: THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO RE STSTRAIN SOME OF . COMING UP THE U.S. WE WILL SEE WHAT THAT MEANS. LET\u2019S GO BACK TO BIG A.I. CLIP STORY PAUSE WITHIN THAT MOVE DOUBLING DOWN ON MAKING ITS OWN CHIPS SEEING NVIDIA OFF HAVING THE WORST WEEK SINCE MAY. KEEP AN EYE ON THE A.I. CHIP STOCKS. CAROLINE: LET\u2019S GET BACK TO THE ALIBABA NUMBERS. WE BRING IN JACOB COOK. WE REALLY SEE THEM PART OF IT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE E-COMMERCE HOW IS THAT PERFORMED FOR THE CHINESE? > > I THINK IT WAS DEFINITELY 1078 BRIGHT SPOTS. WE WERE EXPECTING REASONABLY GOOD NEWS AFTER THE SECOND BIGGEST SHOPPING FESTIVAL UP BUT YOU LOOK AT THE REVIEW REVENUE THEIR REVENUE WAS UP 10% SO THAT IS A LOT OF THE GOOD NEWS POLICE A UNDER WHY THE STOCK IS UP. DESPITE THE MISS. CAROLINE: THE MISS WAS IN MANY WAYS CONGESTED WHEN IT IS UP 11%. GIVE US YOUR READING ON THE DESIRE TO BE TIED TO EX-MERCHANTS BECAUSE SOME WOULD SAY IT IS NOT GRADE BUT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SIGNALS. > > WE ARE WELL PAST THE YEARS OF 30% YEAR OVER YEAR. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 15% IN 2025 THOSE ARE GOOD UNLESS FOR BUSINESSES AND BRANDS. THE COMMERCE 2 IS IMPORTANT THAT IS SINCE APRIL ATTENTION WAS PUT ON THAT AND ROUGHLY THEY COULD BE UP TO 50% MARKET SHARE AND REALLY COMPETING. WHICH SHOWS THE CONSUMERS ARE GOOD AND WE LOOK 59 THE RESTRUCTURING AND GETTING NORTH OF DOUBLE DIGIT KNOW HOW TO COMPETE AND LOOKS GOOD OF THE CORE BUSINESS. CAROLINE: HOW DOES THE FLY PWHAOEL WORK AND YOU LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS GOING DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. > > IN TERMS OF PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION I THINK THAT IS WHY THE INSTANT COMMERCE WAS SUCH A BIG PART. YOU LOOK HOW FULL STACK THAT OFFERING IS YOU HAVE C TO C AND B TO B AND ALL THE PURCHASING IS THERE. THEY ARE GATHERING A TON OF TON. I THINK THEY WILL BE BETTER POSITIONING THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS KNOWINGED ON THE CONSUMER AND THERE WAS GOOD NEWS IF 3ER78S OF ABOUT THE AI MODELS. CAROLINE: YOU ADVISE GLOBAL BRANDS SUCH AS CHINA AND JAPAN AND THE LIKE. HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT. > > THEY ARE ENGAGING MORE. EVEN OVERSEAS IS UP 26 TO 2% A LOT TO DO WITH THE INVESTMENTS IN SINGAPORE AND SELLING ARRANGEMENTS I TO CUSTOMERS AND THE NETWORK IS HELPING TO CONNECT SOUTHEAST ASIA AND USE CHINA AS A 4UB WITH THE BONDED FREE TRADE AND DUMPING THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY OWN ONE OF THE LARGEST PLATFORMS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA SO IT IS EXCITING. CAROLINE: TALKING OF DUMPING OF PRODUCTS I WANT TO ASK YOU IN GEOPOLITICS HOW HAS IT AFFECT ED ALIBABA AND ABILITY TO GROW. > > THERE\u2019S BEEN A LOT OF NEWS NOT JUST ALIBABA BUT WE SAW EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE GETTING THE DATA CENTERS GLOWING SO IT DOESN\u2019T SEEM TO BE AFFECTING THE UNLESS. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH TARIFF. MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE FUN GROWING FAST ER IT IS HARD TO SEE OR THINK THAT THE DAMAGE WITH THE HEAD WINDS IMIN POST WITH THE POSITIONS ARE HAVING ANY EFFECT. I THINK YOU WILL SEE I ESTRICTS BE LIFTED. THERE\u2019S NO POINT AND IT IS HURRYING U.S. COMPANIES AS IT WAS DESIGNED TO IM350ED THE CHINESE. CAROLINE: INTERESTING. BECAUSE YOUR EXPERTISE YOU ARE ON THE GROUND AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING ON THIS. IN THE U.S. AFFECT LIMITATIONS FROM NVIDIA AND NOT GETTING LICENSES AS QUICKLY FEELING LIKE THEY ARE GIVING WE THE OPPORTUNITY YOU ARE NOT FEELING THAT IS A LONG-TERM STANDING. > > NO, I DON\u2019T. A LOT OF MODELS ARE KEEPING UP INTERNATIONALLY. THE LACK OF CHIPS AND COMPUTE IS NOT HEUPBLTDERRING THEM. THEY HAVE ALL THE CHIPS THEY NEED AND THE ADVANCES THAT IS SPUR SPURRING DOMESTICALLY HAVE BEEN STRONG SO THEY ARE NOT SERVING THEIR INTENDED P AND THE COMPANIES DON\u2019T WANT THE RESTRICTIONS AND PEOPLE WANT TO DO MORE BUSINESS THERE. CAROLINE: DO THEY EVEN WANT THE CHIPS. SKWRA > > HOW FAR HAVE THEY DEVELOPED. THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. WE WILL FIND OUT. EUFPB VIDHYA IS NOT DOING VERY WELL OFTEN THIS NEWS. PROBABLY NOT A GOOD TIME SO HOPEFULLY THOSE DOORS OPEN AND THEY GET INTO THAT AND THERE IS THE DEMAND AT THOSE RICE POINTS. EUCAROLINE: JACOB, WE THANK I. LET\u2019S STICK WITH THE E-COMMERCE BECAUSE TODAY IS THE END THE OF THE U.S. WE ALLOWED LOW VALUE TO ENTER THE COUNTRY. THE CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A WIDE IMPACT PACT. JOSH, HAVE YOU GOT AHEAD OF THIS. HAVE AT THE CHANGED. ? > > I THINK A LOT OF FOX HAVE NONE THIS WAS COMING. OTHERS WERE PRETTY 12:00 IN THE MODEL BECAUSE THEY BUILT IT AROUND THIS SO THEY SEE A LOT OF BUSINESSES DOING WORK TO PREPARE AND OTHERS HAVE SHUT DOWN THE BUSINESS MODEL. CAROLINE: WHY WOULD YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN A BUSINESS LINE. WHAT WERE THEY UNABLE TO ACHIEVE TO MAKE IT PROFITABLE. > > I THINK IT IS A LOT OF SMALLER SELLERS. THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE PAPERWORK TO DO THE CLEARANCE AND THEY ARE NOT TO SCHEDULE AND THEY WERE COMPETING THAT THENABLE TO TRIM BACK AT A LOWER PRICE POINT SO IT GAVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND THOSE ARE THE ONES AT RISK. CAROLINE: THOSE THAT HAVE MADE IT WORK HOW MUCH HAVE THEY RESHOEFRD. > > OUR BUSINESS MODEL WE DO A WHILE OVER A BILL AND THE ONES WE WORK WITH HAVE BEEN MOVING A LOT ON SHORE WE HAVE BEEN HELPING FOLKS AN MOVING TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND THIS SHUTS DOWN THE OTHER COUNTRIES. WE SAW THE IMBECOME FROM CHINA IN MAY SO I THINK THAT THE MARKET HAD A CHANCE TO SEE HOW IT WAS PLAYING OUT AND NOW IT IS FORCING THEM NOW. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN OVERNIGHT SO IT IS RAISING PRICES AND THEY DON\u2019T HAVE THE SOPHISTICATION TO HANDLE THE COMPLIANCE TO GETTLE IMPORT. A LOT OF SELLERS NEVER WILL TO DEAL WITH THAT TYPE OF COMPLEXITY SO YOU SEE A MIXED BAG. CAROLINE: WHAT PRODUCTS. > > YOU SEE IT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. IT WITHIN FROM A FEW BILLION DOLLARS TO 60 OR 70 BILLION AND YOU SEE IT A LOT OF HARD GOOD SELLERS BUT MOSTLY FROM CHINA YOU SEE IT IN AREAS THAT WERE FOCUSED ON MANY PORTING PROCESS. AND THE CUSTOM UNIQUE PRODUCTS SMALLER SELLERS ARE SELLING OVERSEAS. YOU SEE THOSE PRODUCTS IMPACTED. > > DO YOU THINK THIS WILL BOLSTER YOUR STRUCTURE IN COMMERCE INSIDE THE UNITED STATES? > > WE HAVE BENEFITED FROM IT BECAUSE MOST OF IT WERE NOT LEVERAGING IT. WE WERE PLAYING BY THE RULES AND MOST WHO WERE WILL SEE THE BENEFIT. PAUSE THEY ARE NOT PAYING THE SAME TARIFF OR DUTIES WE ARE PAYING. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF BRAN AND COMPANIES HAVE WORK ON BUILDING MORE ON SHORE AND MOVING THEM HERE AND WE WILL SEE A LOT OF THE LOOPHOLES WERE COMING FROM CHINA AND OTHER KPBLGTS AND WE WILL THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE TO KEEPING THEM IN . THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" CAROLINE: WELCOME OUR TV AND RADIO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS DISTRIBUTING DATA ON BLOCKCHAIN MARKING THE LATE ST CRYPTO. THEY DISCUSSED THE CHANGES AFFECTING AFTER THE CRACKDOWN OF THE BIDEN YEARS. WE WELCOME YOU TO RADIO AND TV AND PROJECT CRYPTO WAS LAUNCHED AND ENDORSES THE INITIATIVE TO MAKE IT FIFTH FOR PURPOSE. ARE WHEN GETTING ENOUGH CLARITY? HOW QUICKLY MIGHT WE KNOW? > > WE HAVE A LOT OF TKPWROPDZ TO CATCH YOU WERE. THE LAST FOR YEARS WE SAW EFFORT TO SUPPRESS CRYPTO. THAT IS ONE THING THE THEY HAVE HAD DAY OF THE EXTRADITION WITH THE GOAL WE NEED TO MAKE THE UNITED STATES ONE FR OF THE GLOBAL LEADERS IN CRYPTO ASSETS. THAT IS WHY ONE THING I DID WAS NAME ONE OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS WHO SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO THE CRYPTO COMMUNITY. YOU ARE REQUESTING -- GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE PROJECT CRYPTO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COLLEAGUES THEY ANNOUNCED CRYPTO SPRINT SO WE ARE ANXIOUS TO GET SOME THINGS DONE. CAROLINE: IN TERMS OF GETTING THINGS DONE THERE IS A FEVER 3EU67 OF INNOVATION AND ALL THE ABOUT TO DO WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE COMPANIES BUILDING UP CRYPTO AND NEW ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THE PACE. ARE WE GOING AS FAST OR TOO FAST? > > THEY ARE PART OF THE EINO INSULATION BUT THEY ARE ONLY PART OF IT. WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO. WITH THESE CONDITIONS THE S.E.C. IT ITS 90 YEARS OF EXISTENCE WILLING BEEN A DISCLOSURE ORIENTED. WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT OR THUMB ON THE SCALE OF WHETHER SOMETHING IS GOOD OR BAD BUT WHETHER YOU ARE TELLING THE TRUTH WHAT WHEN YOU MARKET THESE. SO THEY CAN PUT CRYPTO WITH THE TREASURY. THEY DIDN\u2019T DISCLOSE WHETHER THE INTENTIONS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OR RULES AND REGULATIONS BUT THERE\u2019S MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO. CAROLINE: IMPORTANT FOR THOSE COMPANIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO BE TREASURY COMPANIES OR PUT HOW SOON WILL THEY KNOW WHETHER THOSE TOKENS ARE DEEMED SECURITIES. > > WE HAVE ALREADY PUT OUT A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS FROM THE SAYING SOME ARE NOT SECURITIES. WE ARE WORKING ON AS PART OF THE PROJECT CRYPTO PARTICULAR COVER TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE WHAT IS AND IS NOT A SECURITY WITH CRYPTO. IT IS TIED UP IN A DECADES OLD DECISION S.E.C. VERSUS HOWIE. THE GOOD USE IS IT IS A PRINCIPLE SPACE IT A INVESTMENT IN THE EXPECT STATION OF PROFIT FROM THE EFFORTS OF OTHERS. HOW DO YOU PLAN THAT IN THE CRYPTO SPACE. CAROLINE: IN THE NEXT MONTH? > > CAN\u2019T TALK ABOUT TIME BUG THIS HAS BEEN PART OF THE EFFORTS FROM DAY ONE OF THIS. WE TOOK A POSITION WHICH I OBJECTED TO AND PUT OUT MANY DISSENT WITH THE IDEA EVERY CRYPTO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BITCOIN WHICH THE FORMER CHAIRMAN TESTIFIED WAS A SECURITY. WE HAD THE FRAMEWORK SAYING WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS. THAT IS WHAT THEY HELD THIS SERIES OF ROUNDLESS. THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST RONALD WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE IN AN OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS. CAROLINE: I\u2019M INTERESTED IN PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SORT OF REGULATION BY ENFORCEMENT AND YOU SAID YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE SCALE BUT HOW MANY ENFORCEMENTS ARE GANG AND INVESTIGATIONS. I KNOW ONE IS BEING SUED IN 345EU. > > WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ONGOING OBJECTIONS RELATED AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WHAT ONE MIGHT SAY FAKE CRYPTO AND IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE PONZI SCHEMES THAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE CREATION OF CURRENCY. CAROLINE: HOW MANY ARE LOOKING AT THE PRIOR FOUR YEARS? > > WE STILL HAVE A ONTO BUT WE HAVE CHANGED IT FROM THE CYBER AND CRYPTO TO BE MORE BROADLY FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF TIPS THAT COME AND I THINK WE ARE ON TRACK FOR NORTHERLY 45,000. SO WE DEPLOY TO STAFF APPROPRIATELY. CAROLINE: HOW IS THAT RELATIONSHIP GOING? > > WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT NOT ONLY BETWEEN US BUT TREASURY AND BANKING REGULATORS HOW TO ADDRESS CRYPTO. WE SAW THAT WITH THE PRESIDENT\u2019S WORKING GROUP. THEY ISSUED THE REPORT LAST MONTH. IT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN ALL OF THE RELEVANT REGULATORS AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH ARE COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER AND COORDINATING TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL. CAROLINE: S.E.C. DOES MORE THAN LOOK AT CRYPTO. YOU ARE CURRENTLY SUING ELON MUSK WITH VIOLATION OF LAW AND HE SETTLED AND WAS MEANT TO MAKE THAT DECLARATION MANY WOULD SAY I DIDN\u2019T DO IT QUICKLY ENOUGH. HE WANTS THAT DROPPED. SHOULD IT BE DROPPED? > > I WON\u2019T COMMENT ON ANY PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION BUT WE HAVE SCHEDULED 13D AND 13G REQUIREMENTS OUT IN. ONE KEY PART WHAT BEING NILE A 13G IS IF YOU\u2019RE A BEFORE INVEST TOOR AND ONE THING WE DID TAKE ACTION THERE ARE A LOCKER ROOM NUMBER OF MANAGERS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHUNKS WELL ABOVE 5% OF STOCK AND WHAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP SHOULD THEY HAVE. THEY ARE DISTRICTING THEY NEED TO HIT NET ZERO GOALS AND HAVE A PLAN TO GET IT NET ZERO. YOU ARE NO LONGER A BEFORE INVESTOR PAUSE WE HAVE CONCERNS WHEN CONGRESS POSTED LAWS SAYING WE HAVE LARGE SHAREHOLDERS MORE THAN 5% DOESN\u2019T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT IT IS A LOT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THE TRANSPARENCY WITH COMPANY MANAGEMENT. CAROLINE: PLENTY MORE ON SR. YOUR AGENDA THAN JUST THE ELON MUSK. COMMISSIONER OF THE S.E.C. MEANWHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THREATENING TARIFFS ON ACCOUNTANTS THAT HAVE DIGITAL LEVIES. SOURCES SAY THEY 34E9 WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP HYPED CLOSED DOORS. WE WILL GET MORE ON THIS. > > LAST WEEK WE LESSONED FROM SORES THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG HAD COME TO THE HOUSE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS. . HE\u2019S BEEN MECHANICING FREQUENT TWREUPS TO THE WHITE HOUSE SINCE THE OUT SET OF THE YEAR TALKING ABOUT ART INITIAL INTELLIGENCE. EUROPEAN REGULATION AND THIS IS DIGITAL DIGITAL SERVICE TAXES IMPOSED ON COMPANIES RELATED TO THEIR REVENUE GENERATED FROM USERS ABROAD AND THIS TAKE PLACES IN ITALY, SPAIN, AND OTHERS AND THE LOBBYING DID WORK WE SAW THAT THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ON TRUTH SOCIAL ABOUT THESE TAXES THREATENING TARIFFS ON MONDAY. CAROLINE: TELL US THE CONTEXT OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG AND THE ADMINISTRATION. > > REMEMBER IN THE PAST PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENED TO THROW HIM IN JAIL AND THIS WAS SOME OF THE CONFLICTS AFTER JANUARY 6 WHEN SINCE THEN YOU HAVE SEEN A REKINDLING OF THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT BEGAN AFTER THE PRESIDENT WAS REFLECTED. ZUCKERBERG HAS MADE TRIPS TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND DONATED AND ATTENDED THE GNAWING GENERATION AND CO-HOSTED A BLOCK TIE EVENT. WE ARE SEEING ZUCKERBERG PURCHASE REAL ESTATE IN D.C. OWNS TWO HOMES 23450ER THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY AND THIS IS THE LATEST AND GREATEST CONVERSATION IT BETWEEN THE TWO AS THAT RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES. CAROLINE: IN TERMS OF IMPEDIMENT ON REVENUE GROWTH IS THIS THE BIGGEST ONE OF HIS AGENDA WITH THINGS THAT COULD BE CHANGED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION LEVEL OR ARE THERE OTHER AREAS HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT. > > META IS THE PARENT COMPANY THAT OVERSEAS INSTAGRAM, WHAT\u2019S A AND, FACEBOOK THEY MAKE THE MOST OF THE REVIEW FROM ADVERTISING AT USERS SO THESE TAXES THAT CREATE A UN COMFORTABLE SITUATION. EUR EUROPEAN REGULATION IS MORE CONCERNING THAN IN THE U.S. WITH A FRIENDLY ADMINISTRATION IT SILICON VALLEY. SO BETWEEN THE DIGITAL SERVICE AND OTHER REGULATIONS AROUND SPEECH AND MARK ZUCKERBERG HAS BEEN CONCERNED AND WE ARE THINKING ABOUT A.I. AND REGULATION AS THE COMPANY PIVOTS AND REALLY MAKES THAT PERHAPS THE TOP PRIORITY OF THIS YEAR AS IT INVESTS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN INDUSTRIES. CAROLINE: PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWING THE LOUISIANA DATA CENTER THAT META IS BILLING. IT IS GOOD IT CATCH UP WITH YOU. COME UPLE UP INVESTORS LOOK TO FOLLOW TRUMP\u2019S POLICY. LET\u2019S CHECK IN ON THE BIG MANUFACTURER INVIDHYA ALL ABOUT THEIR EKING UP 3%. WE DIGEST COMPETITION FROM CHINA AND KEEP AN EYE ON MARVEL MAKES SPECIFIC CHIPS FOR AMAZON AND,BY 5% AS THEY ARE UNABLE TO GIVE CLARITY ON THE FUTURE OF DEMAND. THERE WAS A SIDELINE IN BOOKING FOR THE A.I. SERVICE. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" LET\u2019S TALK ABOUT THE SECONDARY MARKET EQUITY IS SHIFTING AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUSHES AN AMERICA FIRST IN A.I. AND DEFENSE. DEMAND STILL OUTWEIGHS SUPPLY. JOINING US IS SENIOR ANALYST. MANY WANT TO BE ABLE TO BUY SHARES IN THOSE HOST START-UPS AND FEW CAN BUT THERE IS A SECONDARY MARKET. WHERE ARE PEOPLE PILING INTO AND HOW? > > THERE\u2019S BEEN A BIG CONCENTRATION IN THE TOP COMPANIES BECAUSE INFORMATION IS RAEALLY HARDWARE TO COME BY IN THE SECONDARY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO INVEST IN HAVEN\u2019T -- HAVEN\u2019T TOUR YOU ARE LOOKING AT THOSE WITH THE MOST CAPITAL MORE RECENTLY AND THAT IS WHY THERE\u2019S SUCH A HERSELF CONCENTRATION OVER 90% OF VOLUME IN THE TOP 20 COMPANIES. CAROLINE: I CAN IMAGINE THAT IS OPEN BEING THE EYES OF THE WORLD WITH THE CRYPTO NAMES AND GIMINI. 61 BILLION DOLLARS IN VOLUME HOW DOES THERE COMPARE TO THE NEEDS OF COMPANIES THAT ARE THE WORKFORCE OF START-UPS WHO WANT TO SELL OUT AND HAVE LOCKEDITY. > > IT IS NOTABLE BUT IT IS ABOUT 2% OF PRIMARY UNIFORM EVALUATION AND A THIRD OF PRIMARY VALUE OVER THE SAME TIME. WHAT IT MEANS IS SECONDARY RESPECT A VITAL VALVE AND IN THE CURRENT STATE IT ONLY BENEFITS A SELECTS EMPLOYEES AND INVESTORS WHO HAVE ACCESS THAT ARE DRIVING MUCH OF THE VOLUME. CAROLINE: WHAT ABOUT THE VOLUME CHANGING AROUND I.P.O. THERE\u2019S A REPORT IN THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK WHAT WILL WE SEE IN TERMS OF THE HYPE AROUND SECONDARY MARKETS WITH I.P.O. ? > > THERE\u2019S A STRONG CORRELATION WITH THE ACTIVITY AND SECONDARY MARKET. WHEN SPACE AND DEFENSE COMPANY WENT PUBLIC IMMEDIATELY THE SECONDARY MARKET LOOKED AT A DEFENSE COMPANY AND THEY ARE TRADING AS ONE OF THE TOP 10 COMPANIES ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS SO THERE IS THIS RELATIONSHIP AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THIS PRICING TRANSPARENCY. SECONDARY INVESTORS ARE DIP THAN PRIMARY PAUSE THEY HAVE A SHORTER TIME LINE AND THEY DON\u2019T WANT TO WAIT 10 YEARS FOR AN EXIT. THAT IS WHY THEY INVEST IN THE SECONDARY MARKET SO AS SOON AS THE I.P.O. MARKET OPENS THEY WILL PROBABLY LIKELY BY MORE SECONDARY. EUCAROLINE: WHY THE SECONDARY. > > THERE\u2019S A WIDE RANGE BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOWER BARRIER TO ENTRY WITH SHORTER TIME LINES AND LATE STAGE WE ARE LOOKING A THE MORE FAMILY WAS OFFICES, PENSIONS, THERE\u2019S LOTS A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT -- VENTURE PERFORMS AND A LOT OF ESTABLISHED PLAYERS THAT LOOK AT SECONDARY AS THE SPECIFIC STRATEGY SO THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF INVESTORS. CAROLINE: IT IS THE TALE OF THE HAVE AND HAVE NOTS WITH RAISING HONEY. ARE WE SEEING SOME TOTALLY OVERLOOKED. > > THOSE GAINING THE MOST IS A LOT OF TAIL WINDS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING A.I. DEFENSE, SECURITY AND WE ARE REALLY SEEK A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT SPACE IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. CAROLINE: ARE WE GOING TO GET A WHOLE SPACE OF I.P.O.\u2019S IN SEPTEMBER? > > I THINK THE WINDOW IS SLIGHTLY OPEN AND FOR OF A RESET THAN A REBOUND BECAUSE A LOT OF COMPANIES WE ARE SEEING FILE BE FOR I.P.O. ARE ALIGNED WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION KEY SECTORS OR IN COCORRECTABLY PROFESSIONAL WITH GREAT FUNDAMENTALS. IT IS THE TALE OF TWO CITIES AND YOU HAVE TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE KEY SECTORS OR STRONG PROFITABILITY. CAROLINE: GREAT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU. COMING UP LET\u2019S GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC MARKET. DELL, MARVEL BEING HIT HEART. ARE WE QUESTIONING THE SPACE OF A.I. INSTRUCTION IN THE MARKET? THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" CAROLINE: IT HAS BEEN A BIG WEEK FOR A.I. INVESTMENT WITH EARNINGS NVIDIAED A OTHERS QUESTIONING THE PACE OF THE A.I. SPENDING AND QUESTIONING THE CHINESE COMPETITION. LET\u2019S FOCUS ON WHAT IF ANYTHING MARVEL IS TELLING US BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL ABOUT CHIPS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR AMAZON OR ONE OF THOSE. IF YOU CANNOT WIN NOW WHEN CAN YOU? > > IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WERE NOT AS BULLISH AS WE HAVE HEARD TALKING ABOUT THE TOP FOR SPENDING $600 BILLION SO I WOULD PUT AMAZON IN TOP FOUR BUT YOU WILL HAVE PERIODS OF DIGESTION. THAT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH THE DATA CENTERS BUT ONE IS THE MARKET WILL BE THREE TO FOUR TRILLION THAT. IS MORE LOOK 200 BILLION SO HE IS TACKING THAT MARKET BEING 10X BY THE END OF THE DECADE. IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT IT IS DON\u2019T BELIEVE 2K3WR0E69. CAROLINE: SO LOOKING AT A.I.\u2019S SERVICEABLE AND DON\u2019T WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT WILL COME IN FITS AND STARTS. > > EXACTLY. AND OF TO GO TO 2030. EVERY COMPANY WILL SPEND MORE ON A.I. INFRASTRUCTURE. THE HYPER SCALEERS WILL KEEP SPENDING ON THE CAP EX BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH DEMAND. THEY HAVE MORE VISIBILITY TO THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE USE CASES ARE EMERGING. THE NEXT THING IS THE COST SIDE. SINCE GEMINI IS ABLE TO DO A JOB AT A FRACTION THAT IS A ADVANTAGE AND A COMPANY LOOK GOOGLE THAT IS VERTICALLY WITH THE CHESAPEAKE MAY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE LONG RUN. IF THE PERFORMANCE MATCHES. CAROLINE: THE CHINESE GIANT IS INTEGRATED. IT IS DOWN ON THE REPORT THEY ARE GOING. > > WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE LARGE PBGS PLAYER DEVELOPING A IN-HOUSE A.I. CHIP AND IF THE HYPER SCALERS GO IN-HOUSE IT WILL HAVE A BAKER ON THE SPHRBGT COMPANIES WHETHER NVIDIA AND ANYONE. CAROLINE: NVIDIA HAVING THE WORSE WORK. YOU HAVE BEEN ON EVERY SHOW. WE WISH HIM A RESTFUL. DO NOT FORGET TO CHECK OUT OUR FORECAST AND FINDS US ON THE TERMINAL. WISHING YOU A WONDERFUL LABOR DAY NOR THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE MONDAY. WE HAVE A DAY OF REST.
