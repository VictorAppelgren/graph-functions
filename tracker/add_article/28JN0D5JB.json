      "summary": "Social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook are now hubs for the illicit trade of human remains, including skulls, bones and fetuses, often sourced from grave robbing or unregulated medical specimens.  Legal gaps—particularly in the UK’s Human Tissue Act 2004—allow collectors and sellers to buy, sell and modify remains with little oversight, while experts warn that the market fuels further looting and cultural disrespect.  Investigations by The Guardian, LiveScience and academic studies have documented dozens of online sellers, the lack of provenance, and the ease with which buyers can acquire these items, raising concerns about ethics, law enforcement and the need for stricter regulation and enforcement.",
