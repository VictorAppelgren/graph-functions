  "title": "James Dobson ignited the culture wars \u2014 and changed US politics",
  "description": "Long before Rush Limbaugh, Dobson took to the airwaves with his hardcore message",
  "content": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that the death of an important figure among the Christian right would have been big national news. These were people held in high esteem by the political establishment, credited with electing Republican politicians to high office and protecting the nation\u2019s moral character. But when the Family Research Council\u2019s Dr. James C. Dobson \u2014 one of religious right\u2019s most influential figures \u2014 died last week, it wasn\u2019t much of a story, even in right-wing media.\n\nYou would think conservatives would have at least given him a proper memorial. After all, President Donald Trump and his MAGA movement would never have come to power without Dobson and others like him. But now that they have a full-fledged demagogue and cult leader running the country, it appears the American right is no longer interested in conservative Christian leaders of yesteryear.\n\nCharismatic preachers with devoted followers have long been a mainstay of American life. It\u2019s one of our defining characteristics. But there was a time when their importance, along with the activists who peddled their ideas, rivaled those of politicians themselves. Billy Graham and his crusades, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority were, among others, prominent figures in the conservative movement and helped shape American politics for more than 50 years. But Dobson was one of the most instrumental \u2014 and effective \u2014 of those leaders in cultivating the culture war we are still dealing with today.\n\nDobson grew up in the fundamentalist Church of the Nazarene, one of those extremely conservative evangelical faiths that don\u2019t allow dancing or dating, and remained a devoted adherent his entire life. But he was an ambitious type who saw the possibilities of combining his Christian faith with something a bit more modern: The field of psychology. This led him to earn a PhD from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he went on to serve as a professor for over a decade. But he came to national prominence in 1970 with the publication of his book \u201cDare to Discipline.\u201d\n\nThe timing was propitious. Baby boomers were charging through American society at warp speed, challenging the prevailing morals and mores \u2014 and terrifying large numbers of Americans, who felt that the fabric of the nation was unraveling. His book was little more than a permission slip for corporal punishment, something a good many people believed was sorely lacking in the homes and the schools of all those young people with their long hair, loud music and fragrant pot. \u201cDare to Discipline\u201d was a big hit, and its sequel, \u201cThe Strong-Willed Child,\u201d was even bigger.\n\nDobson believed children to be little performers who manipulate adults and need to be tamed. It wasn\u2019t enough, he thought, to simply spank them; they had to be spanked until they lost their will to protest. In \u201cThe Strong-Willed Child\u201d there is a very famous and horrific description of his beating of the family dachshund named Siggy (for Sigmund Freud) when he refused to go into his crate:\n\nThis was how the great conservative Christian psychologist recommended people behave toward the innocent people and creatures who depended upon them. It was truly sick stuff.\n\nDobson entered the political scene around the same time as Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority, in the late 1970s. His schtick, though, was a little different. While Dobson was a far-right evangelical, he wasn\u2019t a preacher. His fame as an author was such that he was soon ready to get into media full-time, and he started Focus on the Family as a \u201cparachurch\u201d organization that openly combined his family psychology practice with evangelical religion and politics. Dobson\u2019s radio show was heard daily on stations all over the country and it tilled the ground for what later became right-wing hate radio. Many years before Rush Limbaugh became a household name, James Dobson was spewing patriarchal vitriol across America\u2019s airwaves.\n\nHe pushed creationism, religious home schooling, anti-pornography and gambling \u2014 the whole wish list of the Christian right. But he spent most of his energy excoriating LGBTQ people and feminists, particularly those who advocated for abortion rights. Over the years, his show became more and more explicitly partisan as Republicans embraced the Christian right as their most important organizing faction. Millions of people heard Dobson\u2019s call.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nDuring the 1980s, along with a couple of other conservative psychologists, he created the Family Research Council to be a sort of evangelical think tank that would write and recommend public policy, steeped in Christian fundamentalist values, to Republican candidates and elected officials. By the 2000s Dobson was a kingmaker in the GOP and was feted by every Republican politician who coveted his endorsement.\n\nAn entire generation of conservatives grew up in households that were under the influence of Dobson and his beliefs. Day after day, they heard him on the radio and were indoctrinated into the hard-right culture war mentality that still pervades the Republican Party.\n\nBut today\u2019s Christian right has been usurped by Trump and his MAGA believers, a quasi-religious cult of personality devoted to the president. Dobson himself became an enthusiastic supporter. Sure, many MAGA voters still consider themselves to be Christians, and some no doubt attend church. But they have shown remarkable flexibility when it comes to the morality of their new leader, and while their culture war continues, it\u2019s not explicitly religious anymore. Now it\u2019s all about fighting the \u201cwoke\u201d left, which refers to the same enemies \u2014 LGBTQ people and feminists mostly, along with Black and brown people who simply want to acknowledge their presence in American society \u2014 as before. Except for a few lone holdouts like House Speaker Mike Johnson, who sounds like a voice from the past when he brings it up, these days there\u2019s nary a peep about the Bible in GOP politics. Then again, how can there be with such a mendacious, felonious, libertine as their standard bearer?\n\nJames Dobson spent many years at the pinnacle of social power and political influence in America. He lived to see Roe v. Wade overturned in 2022, which would have made him happy, and the right still hates the same people he hated, so there was probably some satisfaction in that. But on his death, the religious right was no longer the political powerhouse that it was during his heyday. Trump is now the GOP\u2019s messiah \u2014 and Christian leaders like Dobson paved the way for his ascension. You have to wonder if, at the end of his life, Dobson realized whose work he had really been doing all those years.\n\nThe post James Dobson ignited the culture wars \u2014 and changed US politics appeared first on Salon.com.",

  "summary": "James C. Dobson, a prominent figure in the Christian right and influential in American politics, died last week at the age of 40. His death was not widely reported in right-wing media, despite his prominence in the political establishment. Dobsen, who was instrumental in cultivating the culture war that we are still dealing with today, came to national prominence in 1970 with his book \"Dare to Discipline,\" which he believed was a permission slip for corporal punishment. He also advocated for the creation of religious home-pornography and anti-abortionism, particularly targeting those who oppose abortion rights. His radio show, which he used to air on stations across the country, influenced the culture wars.",

      "text": "Over the course of Billy Graham\u2019s Crusade ministry, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association held four Crusades in the state of Georgia. In 1994, Dr. Graham stepped up to the podium one last time in Georgia, preaching his final Georgia Crusade in the heart of Atlanta. As we celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the 1994 Atlanta Crusade, let\u2019s take a look at the picture it painted of how the Gospel brings hope in an ever-changing world.\nAtlanta, a city rich in civil rights history and culture, no doubt enhanced Dr. Graham\u2019s message of hope through salvation. There was an undeniable emphasis on unity among different backgrounds\u2014denominations, races, and demographics. The arena was filled with a diverse audience. Dr. Graham spoke on redemption, grace, and the hope of Jesus Christ. His message came at a time when social division was at a high and technology was advancing rapidly. It was a period of uncertainty and great change in the nation. This Crusade served as a testament to Dr. Graham\u2019s belief that faith could connect people from all walks of life, fostering an atmosphere of peace.\nFor many in the stands, they had grown up hearing the words of Dr. Graham on television and radio. And that night, they had the opportunity to hear from him in person. But the outcome had little to do with Billy Graham and everything to do with the power of the Word of God. Many attendees accepted Dr. Graham\u2019s invitation to come home, to make a decision to join the family of God that evening.\nThere were many prominent pastors and leaders present at the Crusade. This highlighted the importance of the event, showing that the Crusade was not just about \u2018America\u2019s Pastor\u2019 but about the broader Christian community gathering together to worship and share the Good News of Jesus Christ.\nThe 1994 Atlanta Crusade emphasized how we can have hope in the midst of an ever-changing world, because the Lord remains the same. Dr. Graham\u2019s message inspired people to come together and bring about change in the community.\nIf you have never made the decision to follow Jesus, we invite you to embark on your own journey to hope and redemption. Come and experience the life-changing power of the Cross as you step back into time with Billy Graham in The Journey of Faith tour at the Billy Graham Library. You can also find out more about how to experience peace with God at PeaceWithGod.net."

      "text": "Pat Robertson\nFounder and Chairman\nDr. Robertson served as the founder and chairman of The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. (CBN); co-founder, chancellor, and chief executive officer of Regent University; founder of Operation Blessing Relief and Development Corporation (OB); founder and president of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ); co-founder and chairman of International Family Entertainment, Inc.; and a leading force behind several other influential organizations and broadcast entities. His greatest treasure in life was knowing Jesus Christ and having the privilege of proclaiming Him and His power to others. His life was lived to the glory of God.\nEarly Life, Education, and Military Service\nPat Robertson was born on March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Virginia, to A. Willis Robertson and Gladys Churchill Robertson. His father served for 34 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.\nAfter graduating with honors from McCallie School, a military prep school in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mr. Robertson entered Washington and Lee University in 1946, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1948, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. After graduating magna cum laude from Washington and Lee in 1950, Robertson served as the assistant adjutant of the First Marine Division in Korea. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1952 upon his return to the United States. Mr. Robertson received a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1955 and his M.Div. from New York Theological Seminary in 1959.\nFor more information on the life and ministry of Pat Robertson, please visit: CBN.com/Pat .\nIn lieu of flowers, the Robertson family requests that anyone wishing to honor Pat can do so by visiting here (cbn.com/HonorPat) and supporting the organizations he loved dearly: CBN, Operation Blessing, and the Regent University Pat Robertson Memorial Scholarship Fund.\nFamily\nIn 1954, he married Adelia \u201cDede\u201d Elmer Robertson. They were married 67 years before she predeceased him on April 19, 2022, at the age of 94. Together they had four children: Timothy Brian Robertson of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Elizabeth Robertson Robinson of Dallas, Texas; Gordon Perry Robertson of Chesapeake, Virginia; Ann Robertson LeBlanc of Portsmouth, Virginia; plus 14 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.\nReligious Broadcasting\nIn 1959, Mr. Robertson moved his family to Tidewater, Virginia, with just $70 and a vision of establishing the first Christian television network in the United States. Although he didn\u2019t even own a TV, he filed incorporation papers for The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc., then raised funds to purchase a defunct UHF station. On October 1, 1961, CBN began broadcasting from WYAH-TV in Portsmouth, Virginia. At the time, its signal barely reached the city limits, recalled his son Gordon Robertson, CBN\u2019s president and CEO.\nThe ministry\u2019s scope grew exponentially over the decades, reaching viewers across America and around the globe through television broadcasts, cable, satellite, the internet, and other media. Today, CBN is one of the world\u2019s largest evangelistic ministries, proclaiming the Good News in over 100 countries and dozens of languages, including Russian, Arabic, Spanish, French, and Chinese.\nCBN\u2019s flagship program grew out of a telethon in 1963, when Mr. Robertson asked a \u201cclub\u201d of 700 viewers to give $10 a month. In 1966, The 700 Club program was created, airing each weekday with interviews, prayer and ministry. Today, it is one of the longest-running religious television programs in America. He hosted the daily program until October 1, 2021, the sixtieth anniversary of CBN\u2019s first broadcast, when he announced that Gordon Robertson would be the show\u2019s new full-time host. Over the years, Mr. Robertson\u2019s co-hosts included Ben Kinchlow, Sheila Walsh, Gordon Robertson, Terry Meeuwsen, and Wendy Griffith.\nThroughout its broadcast history, The 700 Club and CBN News have covered national and international events and issues, including key elections, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war on terror, Israel, and the Middle East. Guests have included former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Donald Trump; key congressional leaders from both parties; as well as a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of world and national figures, journalists, professional athletes, celebrities, and pundits.\nRegent University\nIn 1977, Mr. Robertson incorporated CBN University, and classes began in 1978. Later renamed Regent University, the school quickly became a leading academic center for Christian thought and action, and now has over 30,000 alumni. Today, thousands of students take classes on its Virginia Beach campus and online around the world.\nWith the mission of \u201cChristian leadership to change the world,\u201d Regent University offers associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees in numerous disciplines and holds accreditations from bodies including the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.

He resides in Colorado.\nworst parenting book ever! I would rate it at 0 stars if I could.\nThis book is not about helping your child to develop any sense of internal discipline at all, merely about how to beat your child in a battle of wills.\nThe author even advocates smacking a child! This is illegal in my country and all the scientific research backs up how wrong this is. It teaches children that violence and intimidation are OK. It is known even to lower IQs I am shocked how backward and unenlightened this author is.\nWords can not convey what a truly awful parenting method this is, which is an easy road admitedly, but with disastrous long term effects. Normally I can not ever throw a book out, but I couldn't bring myself to inflict this on any child so it goes straight in the recycling bin. I'm totally disgusted with it.\nIf you want a good book on parenting strong willed children, check out instead anything by Howard Glasser, particularly \"transforming the difficult child: the nurtured heart approach\".\nI pulled our old copy of this book off the shelves because I was looking for some guidance for dealing with our youngest, who is about a year and a half old. Although I think the general approach to discipline he advocates is quite sound, I was hoping to find more specifics for dealing with children at that young age. Sadly, kids that young are really not the focus of the book.\nIt is interesting to see the range of reviews in this book. Many of the very negative ones seem to come from two sources:\n- People who are vehemently opposed to any form for corporal punishment; These will, of course, not approve of Dobson's belief that it is appropriate in some circumstances. Dobson repeatedly emphasizes the need for fairness, clear expectations, moderation, appropriateness, and parental self-control when giving such punishment. He also continually drives home the fact that all such punishment must be within the framework of total love where a child always feels worthwhile, cared for, and safe. But there are many who equate physical punishment and child abuse, and all rational thought stops once they hear about spanking.\n- People who disagree with Dr. Dobson because he is a Christian, or a conservative, or because he doesn't think homosexual behavior is healthy and must be promoted and affirmed; These people want to disagree with whatever else he says.\nIt is interesting, really, because he spends some time discussing Dr. Spock in this book. Dr. Spock wrote a very influential book on child-rearing back in the '50's. At the time of Dobson's book (the '70's), Spock was criticized by many for being too permissive, and encouraging parents to not be stern enough with their children. Dobson notes that many of Spock's critics were really mad at him (Dr. Spock) because he opposed the U.S.'s involvement in the Vietnam war and therefore they misrepresented what Dr. Spock wrote. Things have come full circle. Now Dr. Dobson is being accused of being too harsh, but you can often see their complaints are really not because of what he wrote in this book. It is obvious that some of his detractors are actually angry with him for opposing abortion, or divorce, or homosexual behavior, or some other pet cause they may have.\nThis book sums up my daughter to a \"t!\" She was a firecracker before birth and at 13, she is still my firecracker. On the back of the book, Dobson has written,\"....there are others who seem to be looking for a fight upon exit from the womb. Such a child comes into the world smoking a cigar and barking orders in the delivery room.\" Yep! That's my girl! I have been told strong-willed children can learn to become great leaders and my answer is always that I hope my daughter uses her abilities for good and not for evil!! Shaping her will has been tough, but I work at it daily. From the time she was born until now, I have spent many days exhausted and I don't need comments from people who have only dealt with my compliant children (my 11 year old boy is such a child) - until you have parented a strong-will child, you don't know what it is like! Let me back up a bit, I was always everyone's favorite babysitter in high school and was good with children. I went to college to become an elementary school and always had good classroom management. I always just thought it was my talent with children until I met my daughter. I have eaten a lot of humble pie in parenting her, and I now realize that children come with their own agenda and ideas. This doesn't mean that these children can be allowed to be brats or hurt others. It simply means their parents have to work harder to raise them from \"cave people\" into civilized beings who can live in polite society. I am now more patient when I see kids misbehaving in public with tired parents - sure, some may be bad parents, but they may also be tired parents dealing with a strong-willed child and I try to give them the grace and help I wish I had received more often when I was in a similar situation. I'll forage ahead and there are days I see a wonderful person beginning to emerge behind her eyes. Until she is grown (and even then) I will continue to pray for her to be a happy, healthy, contributing member of society! Thanks Dobson! I wish I had picked up your book sooner!!\nI glanced through some of the reviews before reading this and am wondering if many of the 1-star reviewers actually read the book. Yes, Dr. Dobson advocates for spanking (as do most Christian traditional parenting authors), but to me he SO CLEARLY laid out that corporal punishment (or any punishment, for that matter) need be balanced with a powerful, unconditional, and steady LOVE for our children. How did the negative reviewers miss that?\nI borrowed my mom's copy of this book, which she presumably read and marked up when I myself was a strong willed child. How interesting to see the parts that stuck out to her and that shaped her parenting! (For the record, she spanked, and I have never questioned her love).\nI think the title is a bit misleading - there wasn't really anything that particularly applied to strong willed children in this book. It's application is for ALL children (aren't they all strong willed at some point or another?), not specifically those who are stubborn or rebellious in nature.\nHis tone and some of the stories he chose weren't my favorite, but the advice is so solid - the clear message to both love and guide your children - that I couldn't help but give it 5 stars.\nI've never been a huge James Dobson or Focus on the Family fan (though my Dad is), but I thought this deserved a chance. I only got through the first chapters. I hated the mentality of children being trained like animals and forcing your child to bend their wills to yours. This was originally written in the 70s but it had a 50s mentality. Maybe the updated editions are better, but I couldn't stomach what I did read. Thanks for your ideas, but I think I'm in a happier place. Or maybe I just don't have your kind of kid. Or maybe... I'll stop. I don't need to be insulting.\nWhile I'm not a huge fan of Dobson's tone and anecdotes, his content was very helpful. He promotes understanding when a child is willfully disobeying you versus just being a distracted, excitable kid. You discipline in the former situation and try to instruct/teach in the later. And while \"discipline\" includes corporal punishment, it's certainly not limited to that.\nI especially appreciated how he addressed the fact that you want to train your child to respect authority without crushing his or her spirit.\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend this book, even if you don't have a \"strong-willed\" child.\nI didn't realize there was an updated version of the book until I finished it. I guess that negates my observation that too much space was devoted to debunking other parenting philosophies that seemed outdated.\nThere was only a handful of information in here that is useful for me right now, but it was good information that helped me re-evaluate how I discipline and how I could improve for it to be more effective for my strong-willed child. I liked how he presented his suggestions and advice in a light and readable manner. And what I also really liked about this book was how Dr. Dobson discussed and criticized some popular views out there (like not spanking and parenting only by negotiation/explanation, etc.). He does it much more eloquently than I could, so I'm definitely saving that information for whenever I might need to use it in a discussion or debate!\nThis book straight up condones child abuse. One should be alerted to a red flag reading the intro in which he finds beating his dog \u201cinto submission\u201d just a barrel of laughs. If I sound bitter, I am. Please don\u2019t subject your child to this book.\nHorrible book by an even more horrible human being. I regret that I ever read this book and used it to raise my kids. Stay away from this crap unless you want to ruin your children for life!\nI trust Dobson's insights when it comes to managing strong-willed extrovert children, whose personalities have much in common with dogs', in the way you'd handle dogs. He meant well and apparently did well with the ideas he explains here. The problem is that he seems to know absolutely nothing about managing strong-willed introvert children, whose personalities are more like cats'. In other words he offers strategies that might be useful if I were forced to spend a lot of time with the sort of child I would not be willing to adopt, but counterproductive if directed toward the sort of child I'd want to adopt. This book is highly rated by extroverts for extroverts who are trying to bring up extroverts. I only wish the editors had reminded these people that \"extroverts\" is not the same thing as \"people,\" that real extroverts aren't even a majority of humankind. One full star off for the assumption that all or most families include even one extrovert.\n(Note: I have a copy of this book. It is for sale. Like all the books I have for sale, it's either not formed visible mildew or had visible mildew scrubbed off with bleach, but it's in a moldy part of the world so let the buyer beware. When I sell books online I order clean copies from Amazon; when I sell them in real life people can see what they're getting. When I've tried to add \"when and where bought\" information to this page, the system messes up my read dates--won't do that again!)\nDobson, a 200 pound man, brags about beating a 12 pound Dachshund with his belt.\nWhy? Because the dog wanted to sleep next to a heater instead of going to Dobson's bedroom.\nDon't get parenting advice from people who abuse animals.\n\u201cI had seen this defiant mood before,\u201d Dobson explained in the first chapter of his 1978 book, The Strong-Willed Child.\n\u201cThere was only one way to deal with it. The only way to make Siggie obey is to threaten him with destruction. Nothing else works. I turned and went to my closet and got a small belt to help me \u2018reason\u2019 with Mr. Freud.\u201d\n***\n\u201cI hit him again and he tried to bite me . . . That tiny dog and I had the most vicious fight ever staged between man and beast. I fought him up one wall and down the other, with both of us scratching and clawing and growling and swinging the belt.\u201d\nFinally Siggie backed himself into a corner and snarled at the belt-wielding child psychologist. It was to be the little dog\u2019s last stand. \u201cI eventually got him to bed,\u201d Dobson writes, \u201cbut only because I outweighed him 200 to 12!\u201d\nThe next night when Dobson ordered the family pet into his nighttime enclosure, Mr. Freud went \u201cin perfect submission.\u201d\nTwo-hundred-pound man with belt wins. Twelve-pound dog loses.\nRead it as a teacher, not a parent, because it was a free copy and thought I could convert some advice to my situation. Supposedly the 2005 update is more relevant for teachers. He mentions in this version of a future book for teachers. I can't seem to find one anywhere, so maybe he just stuck with parenting and added something to the newer version. Many reviews of this book are negative because of his advocacy of corporal punishment, which is blanketedly described as child abuse, but what I read was just the opposite of abusive. Definitely not insights I'm taught in the teaching profession, which is more concerned with not getting sued than actually helping create a healthy environment in a classroom. As someone not a parent, I'll have to let that controversy rest, but as a teacher, I do know that neither authoritarianism nor permissiveness works. There has to be a balance.\nFirst, ending with Siggie was a bit weird for me...all else aside ..\nWell written and very relevant today in a society which moral values have declined and funneled into the gutter. It's not very controversial for those who studied Childhood Development and have actual experience of watching children grow and develop.\nI do understand why some people hate Dr. Dobson's writings. It's been almost half a century from its publication and we can see clearly how humanism substitution affected our society. We are also now aware (due to social media), how Godless nations treat human lives (and actually make enemies of them). Yet, at the same time, we want to emanate the lifestyles of Godless nations, without considering the societal effect to the future generations of our own nation.\nWe just have to look at the bigger picture, and make personal sacrifices be viewed with dignity once more.\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\nMeh. It was largely common sense and since I didn\u2019t read the updated version it was super out-dated examples so the application is kind of hit or miss. That\u2019s not saying the examples were bad necessarily just not very compelling or easily translated to the 21st century. I didn\u2019t like the layout of the book either - basically just a bunch of anecdotes and then a q&a portion at the end of most chapters. I wasn\u2019t really moved or changed by the material. My big take away is \u201cYou can break the rebellious and counter-productive will of a child just as long as you don\u2019t break his/her spirit - the essence of who they are and how they are uniquely wired\u201d seems reasonable enough!\nRating 2 stars merely because I would not recommend this edition to other young parents. It\u2019s not even being published anymore, likely because so much has changed since this edition was written in the 1970s.\nIf you pick up this edition by chance, it is worth the read, but take some of the data presented with a grain of salt. So much has changed since the 70s\u2026 obstetrical health and data, mental health awareness, social issues, technology development, etc. However, there is also timeless parenting advice in this book. My strong suggestion, if you are able, would be to skip this edition and try to get your hands on \u201cThe New Strong-Willed Child\u201d instead.\nI truly think every parent should read this book - not just those of strong-willed children. As Dobson himself states, we are all strong-willed at the depths of our heart (in some way or another) so I fully believe this book will enlighten any parent who reads it.\nDo I agree with everything he suggests? Of course not. To take this book as the Bible would be foolish. But to toss it aside and call it \u201ca handbook for abuse\u201d is FAR more foolish and shows a lack of emotional maturity.\nI have gleaned so much from this book and knowing my own children, it has helped me see what MY children could benefit from as far as discipline and love.\nI read the old version of this book so I don't know what has been updated. I was apprehensive going into it as I have heard mixed reviews. I will say that a few of the stories/ways he talks about things are somewhat abrasive. I don't agree with everything. However, there was a lot of content that was helpful to me in evaluating what discipline is appropriate in what circumstance. I think if you can look past the old fashioned outlook, take the good stuff and ignore what doesn't sit well, there is a lot of gold to be found.\nI\u2019ve heard of lots of people strongly opposing this book. I can\u2019t imagine why. I didn\u2019t read anything that was morally wrong with what he had to say. The book is very dated but I feel that most of the principles are solid. He seems to truly care about raising a child well and not crushing their spirits. I will take some of the things he said to heart and others won\u2019t be a good fit. I definitely don\u2019t think he\u2019s evil or that the book is wrong. I just thought it was a little long winded toward the end. Overall it\u2019s worth reading at least once.\nNot only was The Strong-Willed Child an extremely enlightening, encouraging read, it brought up excellent points for consideration for the Christian parent.\nWith the Bible as a backing, Dr. Dobson conveys sound logic and is very reasonable with his suggestions that include how to approach difficult topics, addressing behavior problems, and handling not just your average strong-willed toddler but also difficult preteens and teenagers.\nHighly recommend this book to Christian parents wishing to raise their child in a Biblical way.\nI am a 37 year old parent who barely speaks to my own parents. I recalled finding this book as a child, and it breaking my heart. I was trying so hard to do what I thought was right, but I'm a problem?\nMuch later in life, I was reminded and picked this up. It will likely be enjoyed by those who wish to beat, traumatize, and push their children away from Christianity. It answered a lot of questions about how I was treated as a child, at least.\nThe TLDR is that this psychopath encourages you to view children as property, and that it's okay to do whatever you want with your property.\nRead this book way back when my now, grown daughter was young and very strong willed (almost an understatement). Gave me some great insight and help, tho at times I wanted to send my daughter to Dr. Dobson as I was willing to bet he would write a whole new book. She was a challenging child and teenager to say the least!! I know there is \"The New Strong-Willed Child\"... might should buy this for her to read when she has children!!\nAntiquated approach to parenting. Book is full of verbose stories referencing the bible and is often repetitive. Takeaways and lessons are helpful and reflective of other parenting books, but takes a while to get to the main lessons due to the many stories and anecdotes sprinkled in the text. Question and answer parts of the chapters are helpful in exploring potential questions that the reader may have, but contain many long anecdotes before answering the question.\nSome good ideas and solid instruction. Could\u2019ve been trimmed down to half this length. Not for anyone who is into passive parenting (or maybe it\u2019s exactly for them) or believes children don\u2019t need actual discipline (aka structure and clearly defined boundaries). His constant use of the Bible as his reference point for reasoning and citation kind of turned me off after the 35th time. Some science or human studies would\u2019ve buoyed me a little more. Still, a pretty good guide.\nExcellent reminder to me that a strong willed child tests the boundaries often because boundaries = love to them. By enforcing a boundary I'm expressing love to my child. Also good was the recommendation that spankings be reserved for outright rebellion. Offenses that aren't done out of pure defiance merit more creative punishments.\nThis book is very outdated. The author clearly grew up in the era where men rolled the word and women had a little voice. His main point is to smack the child which I do no agree with. My child has a discipline problem because she has ADHD. She cannot control herself or her emotions. I was hoping this book would help me with that but like I said, it is outdated.\nA very good book I think .I would have to read other books on the topic of children to grasp concepts properly Though. One thing I took away is \"don't smile with your students till spring\"..something like that.\nDue to the controversial nature of this book, I feel compelled to write a review. Parts of this were silly, dated and full of poor exegesis . And some principles were actually helpful even if the example and stereotypes less so . 2.5"

      "text": "Jerry Falwell Helps Found the Moral Majority - Timeline Event\nFounder\nJerry Falwell, Paul Weyrich, Richard Viguerie, Robert Billings, Ed McAteer, Howard Phillips\nTime Period\n06-01-1979\nDescription\nThe Moral Majority, with the help of radio and television preacher Jerry Falwell, helped mobilize a generation of conservative Christian voters. The secularization of public schools and the advent of federal protection for abortion rights roused evangelicals and conservative Catholics during the 1970s, leading to the formation of several Christian advocacy groups, including the Moral Majority in 1979. The Moral Majority supported Ronald Reagan in the presidential election of 1980 and was credited with part of his landslide victory over Jimmy Carter, formerly an evangelical darling in 1976. The Moral Majority's success turned Falwell into a household name, even as the organization became a victim of its own success the late 1980s.\nInteractive Timeline(s)\nBrowse Related Timeline Entries\nNarrative\nDuring the 1970s, conservative Catholics and evangelical Protestants became increasingly worried about the moral direction of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court had banned official prayers in public schools, upheld abortion rights, and protected free speech for pornographers. Moreover, the popular though ultimately unsuccessful movement to pass the Equal Rights Amendment for women\u2019s equality in the workplace seemed to undermine the traditional family and male authority. Popular evangelical authors like Francis Schaeffer warned that these decisions were the fruit of a campaign by \"secular humanists\" to transform America from its true origins as a Christian nation. Schaeffer and other conservative intellectuals called for a mass response from evangelical Christians who had been traditionally reluctant to engage in electoral politics. In the late 1970s, however, they responded and a loose network of conservative Christian advocacy groups -- including the Christian Voice, the Moral Majority, the Religious Roundtable, and the National Christian Action Coalition -- were formed. These groups were at the center of the movement that academics later labeled the New Christian Right.\nThe Moral Majority was the largest and most influential of these groups and Jerry Falwell was the key to that success. Falwell, a fundamentalist Baptist minister in Lynchburg, Virginia, had been leery of political activism prior to the 1970s. In March 1965, two weeks after the infamous \"Bloody Sunday\" in Selma, Alabama, Falwell preached a sermon titled \"Ministers and Marchers\" in which he criticized Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights activists for engaging in political activism. Of course, Falwell's sermon was itself quite political in its refusal to challenge the segregated status quo, but it also is a prime example of the belief, common among evangelicals prior to the 1970s, that the church should remain above formal politics. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Falwell's beliefs on race and politics shifted, in part because of the influence of Francis Schaeffer, who first alerted him to the significance of Roe v. Wade.\nAlarmed at the secular drift of American society, Falwell launched an evangelistic campaign with a political edge during the bicentennial in 1975-1976. Falwell called them \"I Love America\" rallies and the grand production, featuring patriotic music by a large choir from Falwell's new Liberty Baptist College (now Liberty University), toured a succession of state capitals. Falwell's campaigns and books promised to return America to the right, God-fearing track, while also attracting the attention of conservative political organizers like Paul Weyrich and Ed McAteer.\nWeyrich, who had founded the Heritage Foundation in 1973 with money from the wealthy Coors family, believed that evangelical Christians were an untapped source of conservative voters. Ed McAteer, a sales executive for Colgate-Palmolive, introduced Weyrich to Falwell at a Dallas rally in February 1979. The rally was held in response to a local television station that had banned popular televangelist James Robison after he had accused homosexuals of being child molesters. More than 10,000 people attended the protest rally, at which Robison introduced Weyrich as \"a brother Cath-o-lic\" and challenged any who had a problem with that to leave the stadium. Afterward, McAteer assembled a collection of preachers, including Falwell and local Southern Baptist preacher W. A. Criswell, to talk with Weyrich about forming a new Christian advocacy group. In response to concerns about church involvement in liberal politics, especially left-leaning judges, Weyrich commissioned a poll of evangelical church-goers that reported an overwhelming majority in favor of conservative activism.\nFalwell expressed interest and a meeting was scheduled for May of that year in Lynchburg, VA. At that meeting, Weyrich offhandedly said, \"Out there, there is a moral majority, but it has been separated by denominational and historical differences.\" Falwell seized on the phrase \"Moral Majority\" as the name for their new organization, which sought to transcend the traditional divide between evangelical Protestants, conservative Catholics, and neoconservative Jews. The Moral Majority's founders embodied that goal, with three Catholics (Weyrich, Richard Viguerie, and Terry Dolan), a Jew (Howard Phillips), and two fundamentalist Baptists (Falwell and Robert Billings). Falwell hosted the Moral Majority's headquarters in Lynchburg and used his popular radio and television show, the Old Time Gospel Hour which aired on 350 stations, to popularize it with his extensive national audience. The Moral Majority Report, mailed monthly to more than 600,000 people, kept up the drumbeat of American dissolution and the need for social and spiritual revival.\nThe following year, observers credited the Moral Majority with Ronald Reagan's landslide victory over Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election. Despite the fact that Carter, a self-proclaimed \"born again\" Christian, had won a majority of the evangelical vote in 1976, Reagan, a divorcee with a less reliably religious background, won 61 percent of the evangelical vote to Carter's 34 percent. The Moral Majority's influence continued during Reagan's two terms in office and made Falwell a national name with real influence. For example, when Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor in the summer of 1981, one of the first people he called in America was Falwell, whom he asked for support in the subsequent American debate over whether to sanction Israeli for the unauthorized action.\nYet Reagan's success also was the undoing of the Moral Majority. The Moral Majority had convinced Americans to fight against \"secular humanism,\" pornography, homosexuality, the ERA, and abortion, but replacing a negative crusade with positive goals was harder. They had won and helped place a conservative Republican in the White House, but while Reagan talked a good game on issues that the New Christian Right cared about during his campaigns, he did not spend much of his political capital on those issues once in office. The Moral Majority began having a hard time attracting donations, changed its name in 1986, and was finally dissolved in 1989. The white conservative evangelicals and Catholics that supported it, however, did not fade away quietly into the night. They continued to vote in overwhelming numbers for conservative politicians in the 1990s and 2000s, giving George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney more than three quarters of the white evangelical vote from 2000-2012. The Moral Majority had played an important role in mobilizing an entire generation of New Christian Right voters.\nThe Moral Majority was the largest and most influential of these groups and Jerry Falwell was the key to that success. Falwell, a fundamentalist Baptist minister in Lynchburg, Virginia, had been leery of political activism prior to the 1970s. In March 1965, two weeks after the infamous \"Bloody Sunday\" in Selma, Alabama, Falwell preached a sermon titled \"Ministers and Marchers\" in which he criticized Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights activists for engaging in political activism. Of course, Falwell's sermon was itself quite political in its refusal to challenge the segregated status quo, but it also is a prime example of the belief, common among evangelicals prior to the 1970s, that the church should remain above formal politics. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Falwell's beliefs on race and politics shifted, in part because of the influence of Francis Schaeffer, who first alerted him to the significance of Roe v. Wade.\nAlarmed at the secular drift of American society, Falwell launched an evangelistic campaign with a political edge during the bicentennial in 1975-1976. Falwell called them \"I Love America\" rallies and the grand production, featuring patriotic music by a large choir from Falwell's new Liberty Baptist College (now Liberty University), toured a succession of state capitals. Falwell's campaigns and books promised to return America to the right, God-fearing track, while also attracting the attention of conservative political organizers like Paul Weyrich and Ed McAteer.\nWeyrich, who had founded the Heritage Foundation in 1973 with money from the wealthy Coors family, believed that evangelical Christians were an untapped source of conservative voters.

      "text": "Help for parents of children and teens is on the way in this practical study of boundaries, motivating without anger, actions and consequences, and respect and being worthy of it.\nJames C. Dobson, Ph.D., hosts the daily radio program Dr. James Dobson's Family Talk.\nA licensed psychologist and marriage, family, and child counselor, he is a clinical member of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. For 14 years Dr. Dobson was an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California School of Medicine, and he served for 17 years on the attending staff of Children's Hospital Los Angeles in the Division of Child Development and Medical Genetics. He earned a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California (1967) in the field of child development.\nHe is the author of more than 50 books, including The New Dare to Discipline, The New Strong-Willed Child, When God Doesn't Make Sense, Night Light, Bringing Up Boys, and the New York Times bestseller Bringing Up Girls.\nHeavily involved in influencing governmental policies related to the family, Dr. Dobson was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the National Advisory Commission to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. He has also served on the Attorney General's Advisory Board on Missing and Exploited Children, the Department of Health and Human Services' Panel on Teen Pregnancy Prevention, and the Commission on Child and Family Welfare. He was elected in 2008 to the National Radio Hall of Fame, and in 2009 received the Ronald Reagan Lifetime Achievement Award.\nDr. Dobson is married to Shirley and is the father of two grown children, Danae and Ryan, and the grandfather of Lincoln and Luci Rose. He resides in Colorado.\nThis booked fucked me up as a child, and continues to screw with my ability to be loving and nurturing to my own children as an adult. If you need fresh ideas and support for helping children learn healthy limits without physically abusing them or extinguishing their humanity, I highly recommend \"How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen\" by Joanna Faber and Julie King.\nInteresting but most of this approach is way too strict in my opinion. And listen, you don't often hear me say that. There were some ideas that I agree with or at least can look at them as food for thought. I read this book at the same time I read Cesar Milan's book on training puppies - and I have to say if you compare the two/ or if you followed each approach/ \"Dare to Disc.\" with the kids and Cesar's approach with the dog - I believe the dog would be the one living the better life.\nThis book was my introduction to Dr. Dobson. Read between 1977 and 1979, when our older son was three to five years old. It seemed to radical then; today it must seem antediluvian. But it rings true, and it works. There's no magic formula for anything involving human beings, but it was a helpful starting point; certainly better than much of the claptrap being foisted on parents then and now.\nThis is a tough book to review. The first 4 chapters are about disciplining your child, with a strong emphasis on spanking. My husband & I choose not to spank. Especially after reading the excellent parenting books, The Five Love Languages of Children and Personality Plus for Parents, I believe that spanking isn't a good way to discipline, and there are even some children who would be damaged emotionally by it. I just tried to replace \"spanking\" with \"timeouts\" in my head. The next section covered education, which I believe is primarily the parents' responsibility, so I enjoyed that. Even there, he is a little old fashioned and seems to believe that sitting still and memorizing rote facts is beneficial. And parts of that section were dry. But there was a lot of good stuff in there, too. The last section was about morality, and I appreciated that section. At the end of the book, he gives another good dose of spanking advice, and even seems to give the impression that if you are a good Christian parent, you must spank your children. I don't believe it. I just wish he offered more creative and appropriate ways of disciplining young children. He manages to come up with creative ideas for teenagers (he doesn't believe in spanking them). So, if you can get past all the spanking propaganda, you can find some good advice in this book.\nI agreed with alot of what Dobson says regarding discipline - be consistent, reward good behavior, and make your child understand that you dislike their behavior, not THEM, when you DO discipline them. You're not doing them a favor by allowing them free reign. And THANK HEAVENS for a solid stance on morality too!\nI also appreciated his thoughts on teachers. Coming from a family of teachers, I've seen firsthand the stressful problems they have to deal with now - not just teaching students, but basically becoming their parents also. Parents can't leave the disciplining to teachers!\nI hope the updated version is better, but I had to read the older version for research. Normally, I probably wouldn't have read a book like this, and I must say - it is awful. Am I able to give it no stars? Because that's what this book deserves.\nNot only do I fundamentally disagree with Dobson's outlook, but he just doesn't do a good job of making his case. His formula goes something like this: make a declarative statement, throw out some anecdotal information to support it, and conclude the chapter stating something like \"I have just proven...\" with great confidence. He doesn't offer much evidence at all to support his claims, which is an important thing to consider. His entire theory is hedged on his own intuition and experience (and misinterpretation of Scripture). The closest he gets is claiming that according to the FBI, teens today (in the 70s) are more violent than ever - but he doesn't actually provide the source. For example, he starts chapter III by stating that \"it should now be apparent to everyone that we are in the midst of a very serious worldwide revolution. This cataclysmic social upheaval is being ignited and fueled by the young - the students - the 'under thirty' populace. . . . these antagonists are united in their opposition to one common target: authority in all its forms\"(98). He makes these claims but doesn't provide evidence, presumably because his audience will agree with him. And they likely may; however, he fails to consider any possible reasons for civil disobedience - or anything short of submitting to all authority at all times - other than the idea that these young people haven't been disciplined enough. Then, later, he claims \"having established the importance of discipline in education\"...but again, he offered no evidence for his claim other than his own opinions and experiences.\nHis language is also troubling. He paints children to be \"adversaries\" of their parents...often ascribing evil intent to children for things that children do because they are young and curious and still learning about the world. Discipline becomes a war between parent and child, child and teacher, etc. Parents are \u201cvictims of emotional blackmail\u201d (28), \"harassed\" (31) by their children, who \"cold-bloodedly\" (29) challenge them. He says from time to time that parents shouldn't beat their children *too* harshly, but then he uses words like \"thrashings\" (60) to describe them.\nHe also notes that corporal punishment is important because pain is a great teacher, using the example of a hot stove: a child touches it, is burned, and knows to keep away. But he doesn't seem to consider what happens to the child if the source of pain is supposedly a trusted and loving one.\nI realize this was written in a different time, so I hope that his updated version is better. Maybe it's just verbal discipline and strict rules? I don't know. I suspect spanking is still a part of it, and knowing what I know of Dobson, I'm sure his patriarchal views don't change much, if at all, in the updated version. Oh, right, that's the other thing - he's clearly writing to \"mom\" most of the time because it is unfair to wait to discipline the child until \u201cpoor, tired dad has come home.\u201d (I won't even go into the other patriarchal stuff he says.)\nMajor medical associations recommend against spanking (much less anything more severe). I hope people will heed their words with more respect and attention than they give to Dobson's.\nPretty common-sense advice, such as: -be consistent -don't give in to whining -follow through with consequences the first time a child disobeys instead of nagging etc.\nI think you would read this same (good) advice in any child-rearing book, but this was presented in a disturbingly Dobsony way.\nMy very favorite part of the book was when Dobson was listing all the horrible things teens were into in the 70s such as drug usage and vandalism, and he included \"civil disobedience\" in the list! Oh, those horrible, undisciplined teens who go to sit-ins and non-violent protests! Oh, the horror! : ) Like I said, disturbingly Dobsony. Also, amusingly un-P.C. by today's standards.\nI started to read this and got about 80 pages in or so and decided to not complete it. I was very disappointed in this book and felt like Dr. Dobson approached child rearing in a philosphical way instead of a biblical way. Very seldomnly did he refer to the Bible and God's viewpoint and occassionally referred to \"mother nature\" and things like that. There are so many philosophies out there on what is the right way to raise a child and I have prayed for my mind to be clear and free from finding a philosphy that fits our family but rather that God would lead me to wisdom from His Word period and I did not feel like this book was in line with that!\nThis book teaches to use spanking, even though there is virtually unanimous conclusion from research that spanking leads to increased anxiety disorders, depression, drug use, delinquency, and more, and lower self-esteem, happiness, etc. All of what you don't want, and less of what you want. He misses the big picture that parenting is about developing character, not just getting unwavering obedience from kids. Children are God's children and thus are people who are free to act, rather than to be acted upon. This means that though we dont let them act in ways that will hurt them or others, and while we do still teach them to honor and obey their parents, there are other and much better, healthier ways to do so. Read Unconditional Parenting to learn how to parent the Christ-like way that develops good character and develops a child who can solve problems, respect you in front of and even behind your back, be kind to others simply because it makes them happy, and does not cause mental illness and all the other things no one wants.\nWhat an excellent book! I was raised under the principles taught in this book and am so thankful to have an updated edition to study and grow in as I begin to raise my own children. Dobson focuses in on the heart issues in raising a child and struggles that a sinful nature in both the parent and child will create. Through the appropriate use of discipline it is possible to shape your child's understanding of the world around them to give them the tools to properly honor God and their parents as they grow. I especially appreciated his discussion on the proper use of positive reinforcement as an encouragement in training your child how to behave. I know the corporal punishment is often the main focus of this book but the reinforcement is also a key part. I highly recommend this book to young parents searching for help on how to raise their children. Do not look down on the age of the book. Some principles are timeless and \"Dare to Discipline\" is one of them!\nOf all the hard-core discipline books from evangelicalism, this one's actually one of the more reasonable. And I'm not a big Dobson fan. The standard elements of such books are here, but he's presenting it for a purely secular audience (the Scripture is all in the back in an appendix).\nIt's funny to read his diatribe against the youth culture of the 60s -- that under-30 set -- when he's only 34 when he wrote the book!! :p It's also funny to read his harangue against the 1950s as the beginning of all evil, when I'm pretty sure now he idolizes the 1950s as the perfection.\nAh . . . but who remembers such things? History is such a bore!\nDTD was written during a time when parents erred on the side of being too lax. homes typically lacked much of any discipline, so dobson did a great service by balancing things out and calling on parents to set limits. i've seen many, however, misuse its message as an excuse for being too harsh and too physical in their discipline, which is why i gave it 2 stars. i still think it is a good book for those who tend to be too lax, however.\nI have not read this book recently, but my father did. He was led to believe that corporal punishment is the way to go by \u201cleaders\u201d such as this guy. Please don\u2019t subject your children to this.\nLove Dobson and Focus on the Family. Now that I'm a mom, I find myself leaning on them more and more for practical Christian advice and support.\nThis book talks about why discipline is important - something often overlooked in modern society. My 18-month old is getting to the age of willful disobedience, so this book was so helpful! It discussed effective ways to discipline in different ages and situations, including spanking. It was so wonderful to have practical, supportive information in this area. There are right and wrong ways to spank, but this knowledge has been lost in a society afraid to openly discuss corporal punishment. I am so glad to have the knowledge captured in this book.\nIt was also written in an easy style. I found myself falling into it. And, I read most of the book in one day.\nNote: Dobson does discuss corporal punishment point-blank towards the beginning of the book and does not pull any punches. He does not use soft or vague words and discusses things very specifically. It was a little hard to read (thinking about applying it to my beloved child!), although I totally understand why the information was included and think it is necessary information for parents to have.\nTo be clear, I hate read this book. Also James Dobson is clearly a kinky MF masquerading as a child/adolescent expert, which is scary (this is coming from a not-super-vanilla human).\nPart of it makes sense to me--Kids need and want boundaries and structure, most kids can be reasoned with unless they're clearly doing what they're doing to challenge authority in which case it's important to establish authority, kids should be taught to respect others and they should be respected as humans, and above all love is the most important thing. I was on board with all of that, for the whole 20 pages that it lasted, and that was after 40 pages of me wanting to constantly throw the book across the restaurant I was in.\nAnd then he talks about spanking and it gets really fucking weird. Also I couldn't get myself to read any of the last chapter about sex education and morality because that was also too weird for me to handle. The section on education & classroom management was painful, the section on \"obstacles to learning\" was one of the dumbest things I've ever read.\nThe best thing about this book is that it reminds you to be consistent in your parenting. It isn't all about corporal punishment, though it does advocate that as a method of discipline for the worst of offenses. Instead, it tells you to tailor the discipline to the offense and the child, and reminds you to make sure to be in tune with your children to make sure that the actions your punishing are actual rebellion and not just tiredness, over-stimulation or even sickness. The book also advocates positive reinforcement as a method of getting your children to do what you want them to do. The only problem with the book is that it doesn't delve into other types of effective discipline. The book is full of common sense advice and I recommend it to every parent.\nBook should be re-named \"dare to beat\". It is illegal to hit an adult, and should be illegal to hit a kid. Writer comes across as a sociopath, under the guise of religion.\nGreat book, but in need of another update. (The \"New\" Dare to Discipline was published in 1995 ... now nearly 20 years old. Yes, hard to believe, but 1995 was almost 20 years ago.) You have to be willing to ignore or look past some of the things that reflect the way things were in the 80's and 90's. Things have changed since then, and so have both children and their parents.\nSince I have young kids, the first half of the book was the most insightful for me. (The 2nd half of the book deals with raising school-aged children, talking mainly about issues kids face with learning at school and also sexual education / morality.)\nBest principles for me?\n(1) Say what you mean, and mean what you say. If you give your kids instruction, and they don't listen -- back up your words with actions (not more words, warnings, etc.). He suggests parents get extremely creative about the actions they use to back up their words. This has already inspired us to stop giving endless warnings to the kids ... but instead to calmly back up our words with action-based discipline that results in the appropriate level of discomfort to the kids (with the objective of helping them remember -- next time -- to listen and obey).\n(2) There is a difference between immaturity and disrespect. When a child shows disrespect or issues a direct challenge to parental authority (as opposed to just forgetfulness, inattentiveness, lack of self-discipline, etc.), Dobson suggests dealing with it in a decisive manner.\nThat helps me a lot ... when my kids are showing immaturity, my objective is to teach them and coach them to maturity. When they show disrespect and challenge for our authority, that calls for a completely different kind of discipline that demands their respect and obedience.\n(3) Dobson believes in rewarding kids as they learn and mature (through praise and through tangible rewards), and he has lots of great ideas for how to do it effectively. He suggests kids learn to earn money and privileges by showing responsibility in the home.\n(4) Dobson reminds parents to shower their kids with love, create an environment of light-heartedness mixed with good humor, and spend lots of time enjoying them and encouraging them. He does a great job showing the balance between love and discipline.\nOverall, 3 stars ... would be 4 stars if it were updated, for example, with advice to parents raising kids in today's post-Christian social environment, or how to manage the challenges created by today's world of smart phones, tablets, social networking, etc.\nI have a feeling that many people who will read this book, or more than likely, never read this book, believe that this book is primarily about spanking your children. They would probably believe Dobson's methods or ideas are out of touch and/or just wrong. Honestly, I haven't made up my mind about spanking yet, but I do know that his book is less about spanking and more about consistent discipline that is done with love and authority, one that will hopefully provide great, healthy boundaries for your children and respect for their parents. You could probably omit the word spanking or things of that nature and still find great benefit from this book. While he seems to be dismissive of some behavioral psychologists early in the book, his methods of reward and punishment borrow heavily from their tradition. And I would say he emphasizes reward more over punishment. Some parenting books I've read give ambiguous guidance and insight into how to be a loving parent, but no real tips or tricks. This book actually provides nice charts and methods to use for chores and other things like that. Now, my main criticism of Dobson is when he turns into the old man on the front porch, railing against the way society is today. He can be very political and terminology for people and certain ideas are often cringeworthy. I could have done without his lectures on the evils of \"safe sex\" education in the schools or his thoughts on communism. Overall, I think we will be keeping this book around. As I said, I don't agree with everything he says, but if I can't think of any books I've read recently where I've agreed with everything they advocate.\n\u201cAlthough no child with severe autism has been successfully transformed into a normal individual, the use of reinforcement therapy did bring some of these patients to a state of civilized behavior.\u201d\nI debated on whether or not to give this three or four stars. I think many assume this book is all about spanking your children, but it really comes down to knowing when it is appropriate to discipline your child, and that it is absolutely essential. I like that he points out that either extreme doesn't work \u2013 you can't simply be harsh and critical and discipline your child all the time, but you also can't give into their every whim and let them run all over you. Both are unhealthy for your child, and will give you less than desirable results. This book teaches that there is a healthy balance \u2013 with every bit of discipline, there needs to be an outpouring of love and affection as well. He also points out that children WANT discipline- they want to know where the boundaries are. He shares several specific stories that contrast what happens when discipline is used, and when discipline is not. And just to be clear- discipline does not just mean corporal punishment or spanking- it is using an appropriate consequence to ensure that a child will respect and listen to his parents. He even points out that each child is different, and if a spanking is not going to teach a child, it shouldn't be used. In this book, Dr. Dobson also addresses education and the decrease in morals in our society, both of which were interesting to read. Overall, I feel this was a very helpful book \u2013 as a previous special education teacher, and a current parent, it is helpful to remember that both discipline and love have a place and that they work together, not exclusively. The things I didn't like about this book \u2013 I really wish he had listed more specific examples. Most parents reaching for this book are probably needing some help with a child of their own ;-), and I wish there had been more ideas listed specifically on how to handle situations where a child is being disrespectful or disobedient. Obviously it would be impossible to address everything because each circumstance is unique, but a list of several examples would've been helpful just to get the gears going. The other thing I didn't love about this book \u2013 there were several grammatical and spelling errors that I feel were just a simple matter of someone not proofreading very well. They weren't too bad, but it happens frequently enough for it to become a bit annoying.\nAlthough still gestating at this moment, the aspect of bearing children that frightens me the most is not the physical abuse pregnancy inflicts on my body, not the pain of labor, but the fact that I'm going to have to discipline my child. I was never good at it as a baby-sitter or Sunday school teacher, and I know that i'm not going to magically acquire the skills to discipline my children just because they happen to enter the world and be mine.\nI highly recommend this book - the first half was a super quick read for me, and I feel like I learned so much from it. The second half deals a little more heavily with discipline (or lack thereof) within the school system, and I found it to be a little dry. However, I still recommend that parents and educators alike read this book and glean from it the wisdom that Dr. Dobson has acquired in his many years as a therapist and parent. This book will continue to serve as a reference to us in the years to come, and I imagine it to become a dog-eared, well-worn book on the shelf.\nThis book me a while to get through. But I am done! I borrowed this from my Bishops wife and I think I am going to have to buy my own copy so I can read it again and again! I like Dr. Dobson's philosophy! I think he is right on. He is very conservative but I really like that! Its refreshing! I learned that I am in charge! I don't know why we forget that, but it felt good to read it. He told a story about a mom who called about her six month old son's fever and he asked what his temperature was and she said \"I don't know he won't let me check it\"...ok sadly enough I heard myself in that lady! The kid was six months old and he already won at the battle of control! He also refers to sex education and teen discipline its a little early for me but that is why I want to buy this book to refer back too! I highly recomend this book to anyone who feels they are out of control. Now to read the first Dare to Discipline!! :)"

  "argos_summary": "James Dobson, a key architect of the modern Christian right, died last week but the news was muted even in conservative media, reflecting a shift in influence from evangelical leaders to Trump\u2011aligned politics. The article traces Dobson\u2019s rise\u2014from his 1970s parenting books and Focus on the Family radio show to founding the Family Research Council\u2014and notes how his legacy helped shape Republican culture wars, yet is now largely eclipsed by the MAGA movement. It situates Dobson within a broader historical context that includes figures like Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson, and references a wide range of reviews of his parenting book that illustrate the controversy over his discipline philosophy.",
