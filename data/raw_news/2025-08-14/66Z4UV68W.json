  "content": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy .\n\nThe \"Plus\" in Anker Solix F3800 Plus isn't just for show \u2014 it's an accurate representation as it takes every core feature of the original and builds on an already excellent home battery backup solution.\n\nIt's been more than a year since I discussed the Anker Solix F3800, and using that product in that time has reinforced the points I made in the review. After a few months with its successor, I can easily say it is a repeat success.\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus is a well-done upgrade with few tradeoffs that will provide a premium portable power station experience. It's an iterative upgrade that will give new buyers of the product bonus perks, but at a higher price \u2014 though you can catch it with heavy discounts.\n\nThe original review still stands. It's an expensive, heavy, yet powerful whole home backup solution that should only be purchased by customers that know exactly what their needs are.\n\nIt's still not quite the perfect capacity-to-weight-and-price ratio, but the increased specs and new features push it to a higher value than the original. Also, if you already own the Anker Solix F3800, it can be paired with the Anker Solix F3800 Plus for expansion.\n\nIf you're looking for a portable unit that'll stand alone without future expansion, there are likely better, more portable options. The Anker Solix F3800 Plus has wheels and well-placed handles for moving around, but it pushes the limit of the term \"portable.\"\n\nIt works best as the core of a larger system with solar panels, expansion batteries, generators, and a Home Power Panel. The Anker Solix F3800 Plus is weaker as a standalone unit versus the competition.\n\nAt first glance, you'd easily mistake the Anker Solix F3800 Plus for the previous model, but there are a few port changes that make them distinguishable. Otherwise, the design is nearly identical with the large gray faceplates, blue LEDs, and big wheels.\n\nIt is 27.6 inches by 15.1 inches by 14.6 inches, so about the size of a large cooler turned on its side. It takes up a significant space in a vehicle or closet, but it is a good size to capacity ratio.\n\nIt gained a few pounds, weighing an incredible 136.7 pounds. It's still a job to maneuver around, even with the handles and wheels, but it's not impossible.\n\nThe big wheels in the back are enough to go over grassy terrain, but avoid anything too challenging. Small bumps can be enough to slam everything to a halt, so be aware of what you're rolling over.\n\nThe suitcase-style pop-up handle is good enough to drag the big battery around. For lifting, there's a hidden handle underneath that makes it easier for one or two people to get it off the ground.\n\nThere are two significant feature additions that set the Anker Solix F3800 Plus apart from its predecessor. Users can charge faster via solar, and there's a new generator bypass feature.\n\nPeak solar input is now 3,200W, up from 2,400W in the previous model. Connecting to an external generator is now more versatile, offering compatibility with both 240V and 120V systems via the Home Power Panel port.\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus starts at 3,840Wh capacity and can be expanded to 53,800Wh with another F3800 unit plus expansion batteries. Those ratings haven't changed across generations, but if you already have the original model, it can be connected to the F3800 Plus for easy expansion.\n\nStarting with just the F3800 Plus can provide some relief during power outages or power on the road. There's no need to try and rush into a whole-home power backup, but it's easier with the piece-by-piece expansion offered by Anker.\n\nThe available inputs and outputs have also changed slightly.\n\nThere are plenty of options for getting power in and out of the Anker Solix F3800 Plus. Some of the specs and ports have changed versus the original model.\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus can also act as an uninterruptible power supply with a delay of 20 ms. Power passthrough when connected to AC power or a generator is also possible, but not when in EV charging mode.\n\nNote that the L14-30R port is the only one available for EV charging in the Plus model. The L14-50R was available previously, but was removed in favor of the RV TT-30R output.\n\nAnker did provide a couple of accessories to test with the unit this time around. I got to try the Anker Solix PS400 Portable Solar Panel, and I was also sent the 240V Charging Cable.\n\nSadly, I don't have a 240V outlet or generator to try the 240V Bypass Charging Cable with, but it is a well-made cable that'll enhance the versatility of the Anker Solix F3800 Plus. It connects to the Home Power Panel port for up to 3,300W of input or power bypass.\n\nThe Anker Solix PS400 Portable Solar Panel proved to be one of the more reliable solar panels I've tried. Now, it shouldn't be any surprise that solar panels can't operate at 100% potential all the time.\n\nI tested the panels at different times and easily got 170W or more with little effort. Of course, bright sunshine without cloud cover at an optimal angle can get you closer to 400W, but that's hard to do with any panel.\n\nGenerally, I've been happy to see around 200W from a single panel. Previous panels I've tested are quoted closer to 200W and are lucky to produce more than 100W without more effort, so the higher potential yields much better results.\n\nUsers can chain four of these panels together to a single solar panel input port. That's 1,600W of potential input, which is doubled with the second solar input port.\n\nThis kind of incredible potential input is very important for both whole-home backup and travel. Either way, you're getting more power, faster, and keeping the lights on for longer thanks to improved solar panel input.\n\nUsing Anker Solix F3800 Plus as a portable power station\n\nI rent, so I still haven't taken the steps to set up whole-home battery backup and solar. So, my use case has leaned more towards the Anker Solix F3800 Plus as a portable power station.\n\nYes, somehow this unit still qualifies as \"portable\" despite it weighing 136.7 pounds. The wheels help, and there's the hidden handle underneath, but it's testing the limits of that moniker.\n\nA knee injury I dealt with for the front half of 2025 made reviewing the Anker Solix F3800 Plus nearly impossible. In that time, I was able to use it as a backup system and test the uninterruptible power supply, but little else.\n\nOnce I was finally able to get enough strength back in my knees to get the battery down the stairs, with help, it proved to be a challenge. This is one hefty battery.\n\nThat said, I think it's an excellent price per watt-hour value. I expect most people will buy one and stick it somewhere in their home or RV for use as a backup or supplementary system.\n\nCamping and such is still possible with this unit, but understand, it's going to take up more space than you'd probably like for shorter excursions. Unless you're hoping for a home backup system to double as a portable camping utility, look at mid-sized portable power stations closer to the 75-pound range.\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus proved to be a similar experience overall compared to its predecessor. It's still whisper-quiet in use until you've put it under significant load, but even then, the fans may hit 60 decibels.\n\nAnker says the standby life is also improved, which has proven true. Topping off the battery was rarely necessary between uses, as it held onto its charge well.\n\nIn these months using the Anker Solix F3800 Plus, I can say it is a reliable, if large, battery. Portable power stations and home backup solutions like these are utilitarian, so there's not much to say beyond it works.\n\nSeriously, three 100W USB-C ports are incredible to have, not to mention six additional AC outlets. There's not much you can't power from this monstrous battery.\n\nWith other power stations, you usually have to choose one device that gets the \"good\" 100W ports and rely on the AC outlets for other devices. With three 100W USB-C ports, you can fast charge an iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and keep your Apple Vision Pro going without needing extra charging bricks.\n\nOf course, the AC outlets are also good for keeping things powered around the home. There have been a few power outages where I plug in the home entertainment system into one outlet, a fan in the other, and stay relatively cool while playing video games until power returned.\n\nAt least the wheels make it easy to move around as long as it doesn't need to go up or down stairs.\n\nI don't have anything new to say about the very straightforward Anker app. It shows the battery and its power allocation in a simple UI, and that's great.\n\nThere are plenty of settings that can be accessed from the app that aren't obvious from the battery itself. Change charging speeds, timeout settings, and more.\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus can connect over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Of course, you're not going to get any information if the battery is completely powered down.\n\nThere's thankfully no sign of a social network within the app, which seems to be becoming more prevalent among utility apps. Smart batteries, bikes, and water bottles all seem to barrage users with unnecessary social tools, and Anker avoids that here.\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus debuted in a higher price slot than the previous model, but regular discounts make it much more affordable \u2014 therefore more bang for your buck. The improved solar charging and generator bypass are excellent year-over-year upgrades.\n\nThis is an incredibly large and heavy portable power station that isn't for everyone. However, if you're looking for massive potential in home battery backup, Anker has you covered.\n\nThose that want to prioritize portability may want to look at smaller systems. Anker offers some, though we can also recommend options from Jackery and Bluetti.\n\nThe high efficiency of the solar connections, AC inputs, and variety of ports make this giant battery a good option. It's an easy choice for those starting on their whole-home backup journey.\n\u2022 Expand all the way to 53.8 kWh\n\u2022 Expanded input up to 3,300 W or 6,000 W with additional battery\n\u2022 Handles and wheels help with maneuverability...\n\u2022 ... but weight is still an issue if you're not prepared to move a 136-pound object\n\u2022 Large, cabinet-like shape won't be suitable for all use cases\n\u2022 More suited for home backup than portable power\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus is a good iteration on an already great product. It's still not perfect, and physics will prevent it from ever being a good option for everyone.\n\nThat said, the capacity is a good tradeoff for the weight, if you can lift it.\n\nWhere to buy the Anker Solix F3800 Plus\n\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Plus is available on its own for $2,799 from Anker, discounted from $4,799 at the time of publication. There's also the 30% tax credit that customers should take into account.\n\nGet the Anker Solix F3800 Plus with the 400W solar panel for $3,199 from Anker, which is discounted from $5,698. The Anker Solix 240V Bypass Charging Cable is also discounted to $299 from $399.",

      "text": "iPad Pro\nAll about iPad Pro\nTable of Contents\n- iPad Pro\n- 1. Next iPad Pro\n- 2. iPad Pro Evolution\n- 3. Pricing and Release\n- 4. Apple Pencil\n- 5. iPadOS\n- 6. Apple Intelligence\n- 7. Seventh-generation (2024)\n- 8. Sixth-generation (2022)\n- iPad Pro (M2) Review\n- Six month update (M2)\n- 9. Fifth-generation iPad Pro (2021)\n- 10. Fourth-generation iPad Pro (2020)\n- 11. Third-generation iPad Pro (2018)\n- 12. Second-generation iPad Pro (2017)\n- 13. First-generation iPad Pro (2015)\nThe iPad Pro is Apple's flagship iPad targeted at professional and prosumer users alike. It is available in two sizes: an 11-inch iPad Pro and 13-inch iPad Pro. They are compatible with the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard.\nThe iPad Pro can function as a tablet, laptop replacement, or even a desktop with a dedicated monitor depending on your personal use case. A feature in macOS called Sidecar transforms any iPad into an external display for the Mac. A feature introduced in macOS Monterey called Universal Control takes this functionality even further by letting a Mac control multiple iPads and Macs at once.\nCommon uses for Apple's tablets include watching videos, reading books and magazines, taking notes, making video calls, and general web browsing. Its portability and power have made it popular with college students and those who frequently travel. It is also a powerful dedicated drawing tablet thanks to the Apple Pencil.\nAs its name suggests, the iPad Pro is capable of professional work. However, its mobile operating system still falls short for some customers. This applies especially to those who need to perform complex tasks, require specific apps that aren't on iPadOS, or create apps in Xcode.\nAfter years of vocal complaints from power users, Apple addressed many of the issues that limited iPad Pro as a productivity machine. iPadOS 26 introduced a new multitasking paradigm and vastly improved file system, among other upgrades.\nNext iPad Pro\nRumors around the iPad Pro with M5 place the release in 2025, but the window keeps slipping. The device was expected initially in the first half of the year, but now it may not arrive until Apple reveals the M5 MacBook Pro.\nAn M5 processor would likely be the only significant change to the product line. The M4 models were redesigned to be thinner and lighter with OLED displays, so Apple isn't likely to do much externally for M5.\nApple Intelligence continues to be a major focus for Apple, so expect M5 to contribute to that. More RAM is also possible, as iPhone 17 Pro is expected to have 12GB, so iPad Pro could step up to 12GB and 24GB based on storage tiers.\nA future iPad Pro could be foldable. Rumors suggest Apple hasn't given up on its iPhone Fold, and could use that technology to develop a foldable iPad, and eventually, a foldable Mac.\nThere is a lot of evidence that shows Apple is working on foldable technology, but rumors have placed the first device at two years away for nearly a decade. If Apple can ever perfect the technology to meet its standards, the fad may have passed and such a device may never release.\nEvolution\nReviewers and the general public have praised all generations of the pro models. The most common criticism is their premium cost. By the time you've added accessories, its price can be greater than or equal to a base MacBook Air or even MacBook Pro.\nApple threw customers a curveball when it began updating iPad Air with M-series processors. While those who already own an iPad Pro will not move to the iPad Air, it rivals the pro-level tablet in several important ways.\nSimilarities include a similar full-screen design and support for the Magic Keyboard and second-generation Apple Pencil. Both product lines are available in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes.\nCompared to the iPad Air, the pro-level iPads boast better performance with M4, ProMotion, and Face ID. The rift between product lines expanded somewhat in 2024 since the updated iPad Pro models are thinner, have OLED displays, and support a different Magic Keyboard.\nCustomers that want the best technology, more storage, and the latest accessories will need to choose iPad Pro.\nPricing and Release\nThe latest 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models were announced in early 2024. They start at $999 for the 11-inch version and $1,299 for the 13-inch model.\nApple Pencil\nThe Apple Pencil is an Apple-developed wireless stylus that works with various iPad models. It is a low-latency stylus with pressure sensitivity and angle detection. The iPad will reject a user's palm input when using the Apple Pencil.\nThe first-generation Apple Pencil was released alongside the first-generation iPad Pro in 2015. It connects to compatible iPad models via Bluetooth and can be charged using the iPad's Lightning port or a Lightning cable when used with the included adapter. The Apple Pencil will last for roughly 12 hours on a full charge. Fifteen seconds of charging time enable the Apple Pencil to perform for up to 30 minutes.\nThe second-generation Apple Pencil has a flat side and uses conductive charging in place of a Lightning connector. It attaches to the flat side of an iPad and pairs utilizing that connection. A double-tap gesture can be used to switch tools in some compatible apps.\nApple moved to a new landscape-oriented selfie camera in iPads, which required new Apple Pencil models. The Apple Pencil Pro introduces new features like haptics, barrel roll, and a squeeze gesture. The USB-C model takes over as a new budget option with USB-C charging.\niPadOS\nThe iPad operating system has seen several significant upgrades since it was first introduced with iPadOS 13.1 in 2019. It appeared as if Apple wanted to further differentiate the tablet line with pro features, but instead, the most significant differences between iOS and iPadOS so far are related to the tablet form factor.\nSome users have requested that Apple skip iPadOS and go straight to macOS, or create some hybrid of the two. Those that can't get their work done on iPad believe Apple is artificially limiting the device by locking it down.\nWith each new iteration of iPad Pro hardware and iPadOS software, Apple has opened up the operating system to be more advanced. External monitor support, Stage Manager, external drive support, Thunderbolt, and cursor support leveled up the iPad Pro meaningfully with each feature.\niPadOS 18 was yet another iterative update with a focus on iOS 18 features like new customization options and changes to system apps. The most significant upgrade is with Apple Intelligence, which is Apple's version of AI that can run on any M-series processor.\nThe iPad-focused features of iPadOS 18 include handwriting recognition and Math Notes. Algorithms learn the user's handwriting and can reproduce it when autocorrecting handwritten text. Users can also write out math equations and see answers auto-populate in their handwriting.\nThe biggest change to iPadOS ever came in 2025 with iPadOS 26. Apple finally abandoned the old Split View and Slide Over paradigm in favor of a full-fledged windowing system.\niPadOS 26 windows work similarly to macOS windows and even have traffic light controls at the top corner for tiling, maximizing, minimizing, or closing the window. There's also a menu bar that appears when the cursor is moved to the top middle of the display.\nApple also revamped the Files app a bit to be more useful for power users. Files and extensions can now be set to open in specific apps, plus there's the new Preview app borrowed from Mac.\nPodcasters can also finally record a show using local audio while on a call. There's also been updates to enable audio control on a per app basis so users can select which inputs and outputs they use instead of it being the most recent connection.\nApple Intelligence\nEvery iPad with an M-series chip can run Apple's take on artificial intelligence \u2014 Apple Intelligence. It is an on-device system that uses large language models and generative technologies for editing text, photos, or providing summaries.\nThe initial launch of Apple Intelligence included Writing Tools, system-wide summaries, and Photos Clean Up, among other smaller features. The rollout of the features initially revealed during WWDC 2024 will take all year, culminating in in WWDC 2025.\nApple released iPadOS 18.2 in December 2024 with Image Playground, ChatGPT integration, and Genmoji. It also refined existing AI features with more tools and polished the overall experience.\nThere isn't anything new in iPadOS 18.3 beyond minor refinements as Apple prepares for the next big release. The iPadOS 18.4 update is expected to include the new app intents system that will provide Apple Intelligence access to in-app data and what is shown on display.\nSeventh-generation (2024)\nAfter releasing no new iPad hardware in 2023, Apple finally revealed the 11-inch iPad Pro and 13-inch iPad Pro with the M4 chip in May 2024. They both have tandem OLED displays, which are two oled panels stacked atop each other, with thinner chassis designs and new accessories.\nMany features returned, like ProMotion, Thunderbolt/USB 4, and the 12MP Main Camera with LiDAR. Apple removed the Ultra Wide Camera and prioritized the single rear camera.\nThe selfie camera moved to the landscape side of the iPad Pro, which necessitated an update to the Apple Pencil charging system. Apple Pencil Pro supports the new charging mechanism.\nThe M4 processor was a big surprise as it was introduced before the M3 Ultra's expected reveal. It is built on an improved 3nm process and brings improved processing cores along with the new GPU architecture introduced with M3. Apple skipped M3 Ultra entirely.\nA new nano-texture glass option is available for select models as an upgrade. The nano-texture glass is ideal for high-end color-managed workflows and demanding ambient lighting environments, maintaining image quality and contrast while reducing glare.\nAlso launched alongside the seventh-generation iPad Pro was the redesigned Magic Keyboard. Like previous iterations, it still features the floating cantilever design, aluminum palm rest, and backlit keyboard. The touchpad, however, is larger, and it fits the new dimensions of the thinner iPad Pro.\nApple rearranged the magnets in the iPad to account for the new design, so older magnetic accessories won't work. Accessory makers jumped onto the new device and quickly iterated with stands, cases, and keyboards for the updated devices.\nRead the full review of the 13-inch iPad Pro where specs and features are detailed and the idea behind \"pro\" in iPad is discussed.\nSixth-generation (2022)\nApple's sixth generation of iPad Pro was a minor spec bump that was announced via a press release in October 2022. Apple moved the tablets to the M2 processor and added a new feature called Apple Pencil hover.\nThere were very few features included with the updated models beyond the new chipset. Apple says users can now capture ProRes video via the rear camera system thanks to the extra processing power.\nApple included Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 to bring its connectivity options up to modern standards. The 5G cellular option remains the same.\nApple Pencil hover is a new feature that enables the iPad to detect how far away the Pencil is being held from the display. Third-party apps can build support for the feature to open up new interactions within apps.\niPad Pro (M2) Review\nApple once again updated the iPad Pro hardware with minor changes to its software. The move to M2 boosts performance, though most users won't notice, and Apple Pencil hover is a novel feature.\nThe M2 processor is the same no matter the device, coupled with up to 16GB of RAM. That means users get the same power and efficiency found in the 13-inch MacBook Pro packed into a thin tablet.\nThe camera system hasn't changed, but the neural engine and image signal processor's power in the M2 processor means better video than ever. Users can now take advantage of the ProRes video format for uncompressed recording.\nThe selfie camera remains in its portrait-oriented location with a 122-degree field of view. Center Stage is still here, and nothing was updated about the camera sensor.\nThunderbolt was also unchanged in the 2022 models. The 40Gbps data transfer and compatibility with Thunderbolt peripherals remain.\nApple Pencil hover adds a new dimension to device interactions, though developers will need to add support. The implementation is well done, as the reactive UI responds well in different cases.\nWe think the Liquid Retina XDR display makes content pop on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. With localized dimming across the 10,000 mini LED backlights, this display can achieve a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.\nApple didn't bring this stunning display to the 11-inch model despite the generational update. Display specs, form factor, ports, speakers, and cameras remain indistinguishable from the previous generation.\nNew connectivity versions are welcome, as these iPads get Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. These upgrades are minimal, but offers some sense of future-proofing.\nWith each iteration, the iPad Pro gets more powerful and more capable. However, we believe Apple still needs to introduce pro-level software like Final Cut or Logic Pro to leverage this power.\nSix month update (M2)\nWe continue to find it difficult to justify the power of the M2 and additional features over previous, cheaper models. Apple hasn't brought any of its professional tools to iPad Pro, so it seems developers don't have a lot of incentive to do so themselves.\nThe introduction of apps like DaVinci Resolve improve the number of use cases that the iPad can cover, but it still lacks some functionality found on Mac.\nWe're looking forward to a future design update and mini LED on the 11-inch model.\nRead more in the full review \u2014 2022 iPad Pro M2 review: Six months later, powerful and still stale\nFifth-generation (2021)\nApple unveiled the fifth-generation 11-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro at its \u201cSpring Loaded\u201d event in April 2021. Like previous generations, it ships in two sizes. However, some advanced hardware is exclusive to the larger model.\nBoth models upgraded to Apple\u2019s powerful M1 processor. The chip\u2019s benchmarks outscore all Intel MacBooks and most Intel desktop Macs. The eight-core processor and eight-core GPU will combine to provide a significant performance boost over the A-series chips in earlier models.\nApple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro differs from the smaller model with a new display, which Apple refers to as Liquid Retina XDR. For this iteration, Apple is using mini LED technology.\nHousing 10,000 mini LEDs behind its 12.9-inch screen, it uses considerably more light sources than the 72 LEDs used in the previous model. Overall, the display can output 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits of peak brightness.\nThe advantage of the technology is similar to the Pro Display XDR's system of local dimming zones, but the iPad Pro goes further still. Using the sheer number of mini LEDs, it has 2,596 local dimming zones, enabling a 1 million to 1 contrast ratio.\nAs well as the improvements to the display, the 12.9-inch model has the same screen features as the 11-inch, including ProMotion, True Tone, and P3 wide color support. Naturally, it is higher-resolution than its stablemate at 2,732 by 2,048 pixels, giving it a pixel density of 264ppi.\nA Thunderbolt 3 port is in the base, enabling it to connect to external devices up to 40Gbps. The connection also includes support for USB 4.\nThe updates also extend to having 5G connectivity, bringing them in line with the iPhone 12 in providing faster cellular Internet access to users.\nFourth-generation (2020)\nApple announced the fourth-generation iPad Pro in March 2020 with new updates to its cameras and processors. The two sizes come with up to 1TB of internal storage and a cellular option.\nThe A12Z Bionic processor was optimized for more powerful graphical applications and better AI for camera operations. The eight-core GPU and eight-core CPU with improved thermals meant more performance than ever, and all models had 6GB of RAM. Apple said the processor was faster and more efficient than most Windows laptops at the time.\nBenchmarks showed a slight improvement in processing and graphical power compared to the A12X. The A12Z is a rebinned version of the A12X, meaning an inactive GPU core is in use now that was not before.\nThe fourth-generation iPad Pro has a dual-camera system with a built-in LiDAR scanner. A 12MP wide-angle and 10MP ultra wide-angle camera will improve photography and depth capture. The camera system uses a similar sensor to those found in the iPhone XR series of phones, so don't expect iPhone 11 levels of quality and no night mode.\nLiDAR can be used for 3D environment mapping to allow AR to be massively improved. The scanner works from up to five meters away and gets results instantly, making AR apps easier to use and more accurate.\nThere are now five independent studio-quality microphones on the device to capture the best audio possible without extra equipment. While this might be useful for better call quality or recording a quick tune on your guitar, don't expect to launch a Podcast using just the built-in mics.\nThe wireless capabilities have also improved, with Wi-Fi 6 and improved LTE coverage with 30 bands versus 29 in previous generations. The U1 chip was notably absent from this updated model.\nAlongside the new iPad comes a new Magic Keyboard designed to transform the tablet into a laptop. It has a glass trackpad, working with the cursor support Apple added to iPadOS in 2020. It uses a hinge mount to make the tablet appear to float above the keys. It also has a scissor-switch keyboard nearly identical to those on the latest MacBooks. The Magic Keyboard with trackpad works with the third and fourth-generation iPad Pro and the iPad Air 4.\nThird-generation (2018)\nApple announced its third-generation pro tablet announced during a 2018 Special Event. It included the classic 12.9-inch size and an 11-inch model that would replace the second generation's 10.5-inch model.\nBoth devices received a new edge-to-edge Liquid Retina display, ProMotion with a 120Hz screen refresh rate, improved front and rear cameras, and the Apple A12X Bionic chip.\nThe third generation was the first to use Face ID and remove Touch ID, like modern iPhones. Face ID on the third-generation iPad Pro can work in any orientation. The tablets also boast tap-to-wake, allowing a user to wake an iPad via touching the screen rather than pressing a physical button.\nThe third-generation models were also the first iPads to use USB-C ports instead of Apple's proprietary Lightning port.\nThe maximum storage capacity of the third generation doubled that of the second generation, with a maximum of 1TB of storage possible on both models. Interestingly, installing 1TB of memory will also gain you more RAM, maxing out at 6GB in both models.\nThe 11-inch model was initially released for $799 for the most basic model, with additional configurations driving the price upward to $1,699. The 12.9-inch model could be bought for $999 at the cheapest, with the one terabyte cellular-enabled model priced at $1,899. Because of reductions in memory pricing across all Apple products since their 2018 launch, the 12.9-inch and 11-inch now max out at $1,499 and $1,699, respectively.\nSecond-generation (2017)\nThe second-generation iPad Pro models were announced at Apple's WWDC event in 2017 and saw significant upgrades over their predecessors. Replacing the 9.7-inch model was the new 10.5-inch model, though the 12.9-inch model's size would remain unchanged.\nBoth second-generation models used an A10X Hex-core CPU and a 12-core GPU, ProMotion display, and a True Tone display that was 50% brighter than the previous models.\nThe second-generation models also boasted a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, a 7-megapixel front-facing camera, and storage capacities up to 512 GB.\nAt launch, the 10.5-inch model started at $649 and could cost as much as $1,079. Depending on the configuration, the 12.9-inch second-generation model could be purchased for as low as $799 or as much as $1299.\nThe second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro was discontinued in October of 2018. Then the 10.5-inch model was later discontinued in March of 2019.\nFirst-generation (2015)\nReleased on November 11, 2015, the first-generation iPad Pro featured a 12.9-inch display and was available in silver, gold, and space gray. Depending on the size or cellular connectivity, it could be purchased for $799 to $1299.\nIn March of 2016, Apple released the smaller 9.7-inch model, which featured an additional rose gold color to its line. It was available for $599 to $1129, depending on the buyer's chosen configuration.\nBoth models included Apple's A9X system-on-a-chip and the Apple M9 motion co-processor, and both featured Touch ID and Retina Display. A smart connector allowed users to connect Apple's Smart Keyboard, and both models were compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil.\nApple discontinued both first-generation iPad Pros in June of 2017."

      "text": "Just announced at CES, the new Anker Solix F3800 offers incredible capacity and expansion opportunities for anyone looking to reduce their reliance on the city's electrical grid \u2014 and we've had one for a few weeks.\nAnker's latest home battery backup solution sits at an interesting crossroads for customers. We wouldn't recommend Anker Solix F3800 for first-time portable power station buyers unless they know exactly what they want or have deep pockets.\nInstead, we see Anker Solix as step one of many to achieving a whole-home backup solution. It works well enough on its own for powering devices for hours or days but ultimately works best as part of a bigger home backup unit or for RV power.\nAnker Solix is incredibly expandable, similar to a Bluetti home backup station we've recently reviewed. The two systems take different approaches to improve portability and expansion \u2014 wheels on Anker versus a separate inverter for Bluetti.\nAccess to electricity is vital, so everyone should consider investing in some kind of power backup solution. Companies like Anker offer many options, from beverage cooler-sized batteries to densely packed towers like the one in this review.\nThe Anker Solix F3800 is a good entry point for those seeking to expand into whole-home energy backup and storage. Add expansion batteries, a direct home panel connection, and solar panels to reduce or remove reliance on the power grid.\nAnker Solix F3800 home battery backup review \u2014 design\nAnyone familiar with Anker should know the company has a particular design philosophy. The Anker Solix F3800 showcases that design with its big gray faceplate, blue LED highlights, and quality-of-life features like wheels and handles.\nPower stations are heavy thanks to densely packed battery cells, but Anker Solix F3800 is the heaviest single-unit product we've ever tested. It weighs 132.3 pounds.\nFor reference, most of the large battery units weigh around 75 pounds. That size and weight translate directly to capacity, and Solix F3800 has plenty of it.\nIt is 27.6 inches tall, 15.3 inches wide, and 15.6 inches deep. That's equivalent in height to a mini fridge but the width and depth of a small drink cooler.\nAn extendable handle lets you pull the battery like a very heavy suitcase. This takes some practice, as 132 pounds isn't exactly a maneuverable weight.\nThere are four wheels \u2014 two small swivel wheels and two large rear wheels. You'll be able to pull it across an even plot of grass, but nothing more rugged than that.\nThankfully, Anker has thought of a way to carry the Solix F3800 without throwing your back, or better yet, with two people. Laying the battery flat on its back exposes a handle in the bottom that folds out for easier carrying.\nPorts\nHome backup solutions and portable power stations like Anker Solix F3800 are crammed with ports. These ports aren't so useful if the unit is acting as a home backup solution, but they certainly come in handy for portable power station use.\nThe Anker Solix F3800 has the following outputs:\n- 3 100W USB-C\n- 2 12W USB-A\n- 6 AC outlets\n- NEMA 14-50 AC\n- NEMA L14-30R AC\n- Car socket\nThe three AC outlets on the left work as uninterruptible power supplies with less than 20ms to switch. Vital loads that need fast switching should be connected to these outlets.\nInputs include standard 1,800W AC, two solar inputs up to 1,200W each, a port for the expansion battery, and a port for the home panel.\nAnker Solix F3800 home battery backup review \u2014 features\nAnker Solix F3800 has a capacity of 3,840Wh with a maximum output of 6,000W. it supports 120V and 240V dual voltage output.\nIn case of a high load surge, it has a 9,000W surge peak.\nCustomers can connect another F3800 to double the output to 12,000W. Attaching additional expansions with the BP3800 allows up to 53.8kWh \u2014 that's double Bluetti's AC300 & B300 total expandability.\nThe inclusion of two large NEMA outlets means users can power their RV or EV directly from Anker Solix F3800.\nIf the unit is connected to the home through a smart panel, customers can control exactly how power is used throughout the day. Pass AC power through to connected loads while simultaneously charging the battery with solar, then switch to the stored power when grid power is more expensive or less green.\nAnker claims that the 3,800Wh capacity is enough to power a home for an entire day. That's based on what a family uses during emergencies like blackouts, not normal use with every appliance running.\nOf course, that one day can be expanded into a week's worth of power if you're willing to upgrade to the 53.8kWh system. Solar adds to that time by providing up to 2,400W in ideal conditions.\nWith a maxed-out Anker Solix system, we expect a user could reduce their reliance on the grid to negligible amounts. How much or how little the grid is needed will depend on location, weather, and other factors.\nUsing the Anker Solix F3800 home battery backup system\nPower stations like the Anker Solix F3800 operate similarly to others in the category. Recent models tend to all use the same LFP chemistry with 3,000 charging cycles, have plenty of ports, and use fans for cooling.\nWhat sets each of these batteries apart is the overall construction and design. There's some factor in the quality of the battery itself, but that hasn't been an issue yet, as the ones we've tested seem to perform within the specs offered by the respective companies.\nAs part of our testing, we plugged in our desk's power strip one day at the start of the shift. The standing desk motor, monitor, iPads, phone charger, AirPods charger, router, and HomePod were powered by the Anker Solix F3800.\nAt 100% capacity, the battery estimated that it would last a little over a day with that consistent load. The load jumped to 400W when operating the standing desk but otherwise remained around 80W.\nThe battery produced between 50 decibels and 60 decibels when the fans engaged. Otherwise, the battery was inaudible.\nWe didn't power the battery off completely overnight, so it kept powering the connected devices like the HomePod. It was at 40% when we returned to work the next day.\nThere's not a lot to say about actually using the battery. It powers on, charges, discharges, and lives up to being a portable power station thanks to its handles and wheels.\nWhat stands out is Anker's overall design, port placement, quiet operation, and expandability. The app is also a well-made tool, if a bit utilitarian.\nThe Anker app\nAnker's app is simple, with a section that displays connected devices. The app lets you control power cycles if you have home equipment like the home panel and solar.\nWithout that advanced equipment, the app serves as a straightforward interface for the Anker Solix F3800. Tap in to see inputs, outputs, and how long the battery can run, given the current load.\nUsers can toggle power or set a timer to shut it off. The settings menu provides access to AC charging speeds, device timeout settings, and other basic controls.\nHome battery backup, wheels included\nAnker Solix F3800 works as a portable station when necessary but shines as a home backup solution. It can be expanded to offer days of power for any home and reduce the user's reliance on grid power.\nSmart design choices like an additional carry handle, large rear wheels, and port arrangement make it an excellent overall product. There are better entry portable power stations for those wishing to dabble in the space, but Anker Solix F3800 is a good choice for those seeking home power backup solutions.\nAnker Solix F3800 home battery backup - Pros\n- Expand all the way to 53.8kWh\n- Up to 2,400W of potential input for fast charging\n- Dual 120V/240V output\n- Plenty of outlets with RV and EV connections\n- Wheels and handles make up for the incredible weight, at least a little\nAnker Solix F3800 home battery backup - Cons\n- Heavy enough to be a problem\n- Could fit in a large RV, but more suited for homes despite the outlets\nRating: 4.5 out of 5\nAnker has a great power station with a good balance of ports and features. The size, weight, and cost of this battery pushes the score down from the ideal.\nIt may be unfair to Anker, but physics is the limiting factor in giving this product 5 out of 5. Simply put, we believe a perfect product in this category would nail a capacity-to-weight ratio, and this leans too heavy.\nWhere to buy the Anker Solix F3800 home battery backup system\nThe new home battery backup system was revealed during CES 2024, so it's a fresh addition to the Anker family. Get Anker Solix F3800 direct from Anker for $3,999. Launch deals can land a discount on the individual battery or combos.\nAppleInsider is at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show this week until January 12, with our reporters seeing the latest HomeKit devices, Apple accessories, 8K monitors, massive televisions, and more in-person throughout the event.

      "text": "Apple Vision Pro\nAll about Apple Vision Pro\nTable of Contents\nApple has been rumored to be working on some kind of Apple VR headset for years, and it's finally here. Though the Apple Vision Pro isn't quite VR, instead, it is mixed reality with AR and VR applications.\nThe headset and its operating system visionOS are referred to by Apple as spatial computing. They blend software with the world around the user via video passthrough.\nApple Vision Pro is a headset that obscures the user's vision, not a pair of transparent goggles or glasses. But high-quality cameras pass 3D video of the environment to the user through a pair of pixel-dense displays.\nIt is seen as the first step into an entirely new kind of computing that could lead to the long-rumored Apple Glass \u2014 AR glasses. Even this headset, with its \"pro\" moniker, is likely just a stepping stone to a more budget-friendly Apple Vision model down the line.\nNext Apple Vision\nRumors are already building about future models. Apple could be preparing four new Apple Vision headsets with some focused on lowering the price, but may not release until late 2027.\nIn the meantime, Apple is expected to update the first-generation hardware with the M4 or M5 processor and possibly include a newly-designed head strap that'll improve comfort.\nApple Vision Pro 2, a 2027 or later model, would iterate on the existing hardware while some speculate an \"Air\" or \"SE\" model could make things lower-priced without sacrificing too much technology. Some hope for a more lightweight model without the glass front display.\nApple announced visionOS 26 during WWDC 2025 and it had more modest updates that focus on quality-of-life changes, but the new Spatial Widgets add a whole new category of interactions. Locked windows and placed widgets will remain in place, even if the Apple Vision Pro is powered off.\nLeaks suggest Apple is developing the next generation of Apple Vision in tandem with the smart AR glasses we've dubbed Apple Glass. No release window has been shared beyond the end of the decade.\nMeta Orion, seen above, is a pair of 2024 prototype glasses that use projectors to show UI over the real world on transparent lenses. Apple Glass are likely to be transparent OLED or similar rather than projectors.\nNew rumors suggest Apple will release the Apple Vision Pro 2 before releasing a lower-priced model. This shift in strategy seems to stem from difficulty getting the lower priced model into the right price range without sacrificing functionality.\nAll has been quiet around next-generation Apple Vision Pro rumors. It seems Apple may announce a chip bump in late 2025 or early 2026. The true second-generation model isn't due until later, and could arrive first, if not alongside, a cheaper unit.\nPricing is up in the air as US tariffs change the calculus for all of Apple's products. It could mean making Apple's already incredibly expensive headset even more costly until tariffs subside.\nApple Vision Pro design\nThe ski goggle-like design that's been rumored since early 2021 ended up being the final product. A curved piece of glass acts as a lens for the multiple cameras, while the exterior case is aluminum.\nThe Solo Knit Band is 3D-knitted as a single piece, easily adjusted with a fit dial, and attached using a pull-tab for easy removal. It provides a snug fit, but leaves most of the headset weight on the wearer's face.\nThe headset is so form-fitting that users can't wear glasses, unlike PlayStation VR 2. Apple partnered with Zeiss to offer prescription or reader lenses that are available as a separate $150 or $100 purchase.\nThe sides of Apple Vision Pro house small speakers called Audio Pods that point spatial audio into the user's ears. The top has a button for controlling certain features like the 3D camera, and the Digital Crown on the right acts as a Home Button and controls immersion.\nA power cable attaches to the side via a proprietary mechanism. It is attached to an external battery pack that enables around 2 hours of portable use, but users can attach the battery to power if needed.\nIf the battery dies, the entire headset shuts down, as no backup power is available. When Apple Vision Pro is shut down, window placement is forgotten and has to be reset.\nThe front glass acts as an external display for a feature called eyeSight. It enables users to indicate if they are paying attention or not via an admittedly odd effect.\nWhen the user is fully immersed and can't see the outside world, a colorful waveform appears. If passthrough is active, the user's eyes are visible through a lenticular display. Nothing is shown on the external display if a person isn't looking at it.\neyeSight was designed to ensure that users could feel confident in using the headset in any environment. However, it seems some social hurdles will have to be overcome before such technology is commonplace during social interactions.\nSince eyeSight relies on a user's Persona, it has the same uncanny valley effect. Personas are still in beta, so odd bugs appear that make user's eyes look shut or distorted.\nApple Vision Pro technology\nApple's headset is a standalone device running on an M2 processor and R1 co-processor. The dual-chip design enables spatial experiences \u2014 M2 processing visionOS and graphics, while R1 is dedicated to processing camera input, sensors, and microphones.\nA reference found in Xcode suggests the Apple Vision Pro has 16GB of RAM, which is the same amount in developer kits. Customers can configure their devices with 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage.\nThere is a 12-millisecond lag from camera to display, which users shouldn't be able to notice. The passthrough works best in bright environments, but it is done well enough that depth perception isn't an issue.\nAn eye-tracking system of LEDs and infrared cameras enables precise controls just by looking. Users can glance at a text input field and then speak to fill it in.\nThere are 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones in the aluminum and glass enclosure. This all adds up to a heavier-than-average product when compared to competing VR headsets.\nTwo high-resolution cameras transmit over one billion pixels per second to the displays. Each display has a 3,660 pixels by 3,200 pixels resolution, or about 3,380 pixels per inch.\nThe display system uses a micro-OLED backplane with pixels seven and a half microns wide, allowing for it to fit about 50 pixels in the same space as a single iPhone pixel. A custom three-element lens was designed to magnify the screen and make it wrap around as wide as possible for the user's vision.\nLiDAR and a TrueDepth camera work together to create a fused 3D map of the environment. Infrared flood illuminators work with other sensors to enhance hand tracking in low light.\nThere is a fan keeping the processors cool and vent holes in the top and bottom of the headset. While certain spots on the Apple Vision Pro exterior might feel warm during use, it's never hot on the user's face thanks to separation by the Light Seal.\nSince Apple Vision Pro has multiple cameras, it can capture \"spatial\" 3D content. Recorded spatial video can be viewed in the Photos app on an Apple Vision Pro headset. Over 150 3D movies were available within the Apple TV app at launch.\nApple added basic 3D video recording to the iPhone 15 Pro with iOS 17. It can capture 1080p 30Hz spatial video that can be played back within the headset natively.\nSpatial video captured on Apple Vision Pro has more depth, but spatial video captured on iPhone is more crisp. Either way, future hardware will make today's videos look terrible by comparison.\nSpatial Personas\nOne of the first post-release features to get added to Apple Vision Pro is called Spatial Personas. The user's Persona is no longer locked inside of a 3D window during FaceTime calls and SharePlay, enabling more immersive interactions.\nThe Spatial Persona takes on a ghost-like consistency since Apple Vision Pro has no awareness of what the back of a person looks like. Only the user's face, a bit of hair, and upper chest are visible with detached hands floating around.\nThe effect is uncanny at first, but becomes more natural as the oddly designed Personas play a psychological trick to convince you you're sharing a space with the person. The combination of 3D, spatial audio, and the ability to look each other in the eye creates quite the convincing effect.\nOptic ID, privacy, and security\nFor security, Apple introduces Optic ID as an iris-scanning system. Much like Face ID or Touch ID, it will be used to authenticate the user, enable Apple Pay purchases, and other security-related elements.\nApple explains that Optic ID uses invisible LED light sources to analyze the iris, which is then compared to the enrolled data stored on the Secure Enclave, which is similar to the process used for Face ID and Touch ID. The Optic ID data is fully encrypted, not provided to apps, and never leaves the device itself.\nContinuing the privacy theme, the areas where the user looks on the display and eye tracking data aren't shared with Apple or websites. Instead, data from sensors and cameras are processed at a system level so that apps don't necessarily need to \"see\" the user or their surroundings to provide spatial experiences.\nApple VR, AR, or MR\nApple avoided calling any experience offered by Apple Vision Pro a conventional name like \"Apple VR.\" Instead, it stuck to its own marketing terms like Spatial Computing.\nThere has been some contention on what to call this headset. Some refer to it as Apple VR since users put on a headset and are shown content. Others call it Apple AR with options for full immersion thanks to the Digital Crown.\nEven the term Mixed Reality (MR) doesn't quite fit. Even if it is just marketing, Spatial Computing describes the experience well.\nThink of it this way \u2014 Oculus and PlayStation VR are easily classified as VR headsets since virtual reality experiences are their primary function. For Apple Vision Pro, VR is just a feature, not the entire purpose.\nDuring the keynote and developer sessions, Apple used in-house marketing terms to refer to each experience. It calls 2D apps \"windows,\" 3D objects \"volumes,\" and fully immersive VR \"spaces.\"\nvisionOS\nThe software is run via visionOS with apps from iPhone and iPad able to operate with little to no developer intervention. Compatible apps shown in the 3D space are still 2D windows that constrains content within that space.\nNative apps take on 3D effects and developers can add 3D objects around a window called ornaments that enhance interactions. Menus and controls appear to pop in front of or beside the app.\nObjects created in the USDZ format can be pulled into a space, but it seems developers will need to tool unique experiences for visionOS using specific frameworks. Apps previously built with ARKit will show up as a 2D window.\nFull Apple VR experiences weren't the focal point of the keynote, but they do exist. Apple plans to film multiple 360-degree videos for users to become immersed in, not to mention third-party VR apps.\nThe visionOS SDK was provided to developers in late June, 2023. It included a simulator to interact with software in a testing environment, but full-on-device testing wasn't possible until hardware kits and sessions arrived in July.\nMany developers opted out of including their existing iPad app in the visionOS app store at launch. The lack of access to hardware to test the apps on made it difficult to know if the apps would be usable or lead to customer complaints.\nOnly about 600 native applications were available at launch on February 2, 2024. That number is increasing rapidly as developers finally get their hands on the hardware.\nApple revealed visionOS 2 during WWDC 2024 and it contained a few quality-of-life updates. Users can convert any photo to 3D, new gestures make navigation easier, and developers have more APIs.\nThe new display feature lets users view the virtual Mac display in normal, wide, and ultra wide sizes. The screen can literally wrap around the user with a high-resolution view that takes advantage of foveated rendering.\nSpatial Computing competition\nApple may have only just announced its Spatial Computing platform, but that doesn't mean it's the only one on the market. Competitors have been exploring AR and other extended-reality solutions for over a decade.\nGoogle has abandoned Glass, and Microsoft has moved on from Hololens, but other options still exist. Xreal Air are among the few products attempting to provide AR today, despite the limited technology in play at the consumer level.\nApple Vision Pro review\nApple Vision Pro is Apple's first spatial computer, so that makes reviewing it a significant challenge. While the device has been around for a while now, not enough has changed to warrant revisiting our initial views from the early review and one month review.\nAfter a year, it is clear that Apple needs to push harder for more native apps and content on Apple Vision Pro.\nDesign\nThe first thing to understand about Apple Vision Pro is that there's very little on the market it can be compared to directly, if any. It runs a spatial operating system called visionOS, it is a wearable computer meant for more than just gaming, and it doesn't have physical controllers.\nApple Vision Pro is on the heavy end of the spectrum when compared to other headsets. The aluminum and glass enclosure looks and feels more premium than products like the Oculus or PSVR that rely on plastic construction.\nThere are two band options, the Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band. Which one is more comfortable will depend entirely on the user, but many seem to prefer the Dual Loop Band.\nThe Light Seal, cushion, and band are all sized during the order process. Apple Vision Pro is precisely fit to the user, and wrong sized components can lead to discomfort.\nThere is an external battery pack that offers a 2 hour battery life. A cable can be attached to the battery to keep Vision Pro powered indefinitely.\nApple Vision Pro weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces, depending on the paired accessories. The battery pack weighs 12.45 ounces.\nDisplay\nPerhaps the most impressive part of Apple Vision Pro is the dual micro-OLED displays. They provide a 3,660 pixel by 3,200 pixel resolution, which is nearly 4K per eye.\nThe display can refresh between 90Hz, 96Hz, and 100Hz. Videos that play at 30fps and 24fps are able to play at their native frame rates to prevent judder.\nZeiss optical inserts are available for those that require vision correction. With or without the additional inserts, expect a slight glare when viewing high contrast content.\nThe external cameras and sensors work with the R1 to recreate the physical world as a virtually lag free 3D rendering inside the headset. The resulting image is a slightly dimmer representation of the real world, but it is done well enough that the passthrough is quite convincing.\nUnlike other virtual reality headset options on the market, Apple prioritized visual fidelity when using passthrough. However, it also provided a high-density display capable of producing incredible immersive content in a 3D space.\nFeatures\nApple Vision Pro has a varied feature set similar to an iPad or Mac. It can perform work and productivity tasks, be an entertainment device, or a communication tool. The most obvious difference here is the interface behind how you get those tasks done.\nApp windows float about in a virtual space, either a representation of the room you're in or a spatial environment. Native apps have 3D UI elements and are easier to use with look and tap gestures, while compatible apps from iPad are not optimized, but work well with a Magic Trackpad.\nWatching video is immersive even if it is just a basic 2D YouTube channel. The immersion increases with 3D movies and the most incredible experiences can be found with Apple Immersive Video.\nThe biggest issue with Apple Vision Pro in the months since launch is a lack of immersive content. This special video type is new and Apple seems to be the only company able to produce it at the moment, and the rollout has been slow if non-existent.\nThe immersive content and 3D video can be found in the Apple TV app, Disney+, and other apps. Apple Arcade even has a selection of spatial games.\nAudio playback from Apple Vision Pro works great with the dual driver Audio Pods. However, for even better audio and bass, AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are the way to go.\nAnother powerful feature of Apple Vision Pro is the Mac Virtual Display. It allows the user to bring in a 4K display from their Mac and use applications in the virtual window.\nA spatial computing start\nApple Vision Pro is in its infancy and until it launches globally, there will likely be many popular apps missing from the native App Store. It is not a device for everyone, the price alone says as much.\nThat isn't to say it is a failure. It is an excellent first-generation product that is good enough and represents an exciting future for spatial computing.\nApple is expected to reveal visionOS 2.0 during WWDC in June. That update may sand off some of the rough edges in this nascent platform.\nUsing Apple Vision Pro (pre-release)\nApple is providing developer labs and kits to help with the pre-release development of apps for the Spatial Computing platform. This has allowed some first-hand experience beyond Apple's initial WWDC announcement to make it out to the public.\nOverall, those who have interacted with the headset come away with similar ideas and feelings. This is a first-generation product that is entering a crowded space but also stands apart as a mix of AR and VR with high-end technology making things feel effortless.\nUsers familiar with the competitor's headsets say that Apple Vision Pro has a wider and taller field of view. Certain lighting environments, like super bright rooms or dim areas, show the limitations of the video feed, but it isn't distracting.\nEye tracking and gesture controls seem to be excellent, even in pre-release demos. These systems feel well thought out and executed and are missing some of the usual growing pains new interaction paradigms tend to have.\nDedicated apps seem to work well and blend in with the environment, giving enterprise developers an excellent option for job or maintenance training. And while Apple says iPad apps can be ported with little effort, developers will need to give some attention to their apps to ensure legibility and controls translate to the platform.\nWeight wasn't an issue, though after over an hour of constant use, fatigue did start to set in. Eye strain didn't seem to be an issue, given the quality of the displays.\nvisionOS 26\nApple introduced some interesting updates in 2025 with visionOS 26. Personas have vastly improved and spatial widgets bring permanent and pinned objects to the platform.\nWidgets in visionOS act as a kind of wall ornament that can display information from various apps. The Apple Music spatial widget might be the most imaginative, as it takes a playlist and turns it into a kind of concert poster that live updates with whatever album is playing.\nWidgets like the clock, calendar, or photos can be inset into a surface to make them appear to have depth. One of the photos widgets allows users to set a panoramic behind a window, which changes perspective based on the user's position.\nA side-effect of getting these permanently placed widgets is pinned windows. If a window is lined up with a surface, it will snap to it and lock in place.\nPersonas were also improved with visionOS 26. They've pushed beyond the weird uncanny valley video-game like avatars into something passable as real \u2014 at least from a distance.\nWhen viewed inside of a tiny FaceTime window, it would be easy to mistake a Persona for a person, at least until they turned their head. Enlarge the image and things become clear, like limited facial movements and odd details at the edges.\nApple Vision Pro release date and price\nApple tends to announce products shortly before they are released, but since Apple Vision Pro is a new platform, it gave itself plenty of space. Developers were given about a year to work on their visionOS experiences, and developer kits are available with stringent secrecy protocols via a request application.\nEstimates place the first year of shipments between 400,000 and 1 million units. The high price may prove prohibitive, but ambitious supply chain numbers indicate 10 million shipped in three years.\nApple Vision Pro was available to pre-order on January 19 starting at $3,499 with 256GB of storage and shipped February 2, 2024. It is bundled with two head straps, light shields, and the battery. The optical inserts are available online-only at $99 for reader-strength lenses and $149 for prescription-strength lenses."

MacBook Pro History\n- New MacBook Pro\n- Fifth gen\n- Fourth gen\n- Third gen\n- Second gen\n- First gen\n- Current models\n- Closeout models\nThe MacBook Pro debuted on the cusp of Apple's transition to Intel-based processors in 2006 and has been the flagship laptop for the company since. It has flourished as the laptop of choice for Apple developers and continues to be one of Apple's most important products even after its transition to custom Apple Silicon.\nThe MacBook Pro runs macOS and uses proprietary Apple Silicon. The latest models have a unibody aluminum design, displays with a notch cutout, and a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID.\nApple revealed its own artificial intelligence efforts during WWDC 2024 and it is called Apple Intelligence. It is a privacy-focused feature set with on-device models that can call out to a server-side model powered by Apple Cloud Compute. Only Macs with M-series processors will have access to Apple's AI when they upgrade to macOS Sequoia or later.\nApple is expected to update the MacBook Pro to M5 at the end of 2025 or early 2026. A lot depends on when Apple is able to ship the next-generation chipset, which may be revealed in an updated iPad Pro in October.\nThe Mac Studio was updated with M4 Max and M3 Ultra in early 2025, and Apple indicated that not every generation will get an Ultra chip. So there's a solid chance there will never be an M4 Ultra.\nThe new MacBook Pro models likely won't have any redesigned elements or external changes. Many of Apple's products will see a spec bump for M5, but recent hardware renovations mean designs will stay the same.\nApple Silicon release cycle\nM5 models of the MacBook Pro are expected to be revealed in the fall of 2025 or early 2026.\nThe M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max were introduced in the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in October 2024. These chipset upgrades were accompanied by display changes and a Nano Texture option.\nAll models now start at 16GB of RAM for better support of Apple Intelligence features.\nThe M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max were revealed at once in October 2023, a release that saw the end of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The spec bump didn't change much about the MacBook but it introduced the space black color for high end models.\nThe M2 processor was revealed during WWDC in 2022 and added to the existing 13-inch MacBook Pro. Unlike the M2 MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro received no other notable changes to its design or functionality. In January 2023, Apple unveiled the M2 Pro and M2 Max processors for the updated MacBook Pro lineup.\nThe introduction of the M1 processor to the 13-inch MacBook Pro revitalized the product after it languished under Intel's slow product updates and poor optimization. Apple chose not to change the external appearance of its MacBook Pro lineup when it debuted the M1 in 2020. Then later, the 24-inch iMac was exemplary of what Apple can achieve when using its custom processors.\nThe M1 Pro and M1 Max processors were revealed alongside a redesigned 16-inch MacBook Pro and 14-inch MacBook Pro in late 2021. They abandoned the Touch Bar in favor of full-sized function keys and added several ports.\nMacBook Pro \u2014 Design\nApple introduced the aluminum unibody design in the second-generation MacBook Pro, and that overall design has stuck around since. The chassis became thinner with each iteration of the MacBook Pro until Apple removed all legacy ports in favor of four USB Type-C Thunderbolt ports. However, Apple's 2021 models brought back the HDMI port and SD card slot in a slightly thicker case design.\nAll modern versions of the laptop have a large glass trackpad, an updated Magic Keyboard with scissor switches, and an Apple logo on the display case. The Touch Bar was present on the 13-inch MacBook Pro until it was discontinued in 2023. Additionally, all MacBook Pro models are equipped with a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system featuring force-cancelling woofers.\nApple's approach to case design has remained largely unchanged, even with a slight redesign to accommodate the additional ports and increased cooling needs in the 2021 models. Notably, Apple increased the size of the feet on the laptops to allow for better airflow underneath during regular use.\nThe M3 Pro and M3 Max models released in late 2023 are available in a new space black color option, replacing the previous space gray option. Apple brought space black to the entire M4 MacBook Pro lineup in 2024, but otherwise the industrial design didn't change.\nMacBook Pro \u2014 Processors and Configurations\nThere are three sizes of MacBook Pro and twelve different processors available across four generations. The M4 processor family took over, but M3, M2, and M1 models can still be found at third-party retailers.\nCustomers can choose between the M4 Pro chip or M4 Max chip in either the 16-inch MacBook Pro or 14-inch MacBook Pro during purchase. Both models have identical port configurations, display specs, and designs \u2014 only the display size and battery life differ. The M1 Pro, M1 Max, M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M3 Pro, M3 Max configurations can still be purchased at select retailers, but Apple no longer offers them new.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro didn't get an M3 option, instead Apple included the M3 and then M4 in the 14-inch MacBook Pro. This machine replaces the low-end of the MacBook Pro line.\nThe base M4 has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU that can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM. Dynamic Caching enables more impressive graphical processing like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh mapping.\nThe M4 Pro has two configuration options. The base chip has an 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU while the upgraded version has a 14-core CPU and an 20-core GPU. It supports up to 48GB of RAM and 4TB SSD.\nThe Apple M4 Max chip takes things even further with a 14-core CPU and 32-core GPU. It can be upgraded with a 16-core CPU, a 40-core GPU, and up to 128GB of RAM.\nApple doesn't ship the Ultra chipset in MacBooks, but it is notable that the M3 generation won't be getting an Ultra. M4 Max outperforms M2 Ultra in benchmark tests.\nI/O\nApple moved away from the scissor-switch mechanism in favor of a thinner \"butterfly\" mechanism in 2015 in the MacBook Pro, which led to several issues. The MacBook keyboards have been under heavy scrutiny since.\nThe first version of the butterfly keyboard launched with the tiny 12-inch MacBook. That now-retired laptop sacrificed processing power for an ultra-thin and lightweight design, including a keyboard mechanism prioritizing thinness over travel distance and reliability. The controversial butterfly switch led to numerous issues, including stuck or unresponsive keys. The company eventually started a warranty program to service MacBooks with noticeable keyboard problems.\nIn late 2019, Apple debuted an updated 16-inch MacBook Pro with a return to the scissor-switch mechanism. Apple called it the Magic Keyboard, with scissor switches resembling those on Apple's desktop keyboard of the same name.\nApple never quite solved the butterfly issue, no matter the design revisions and fixes it provided. The butterfly keyboard was replaced with the new Magic Keyboard across the MacBook lineup. The last one to receive the new keyboard was the 13-inch MacBook Pro, released in early 2020.\nAs rumors of thinner devices continue to surface, it seems Apple may encounter another keyboard redesign in the near future. The existing keyboard is sturdy and Apple can't have a repeat of the butterfly problem.\nTrackpad\nIn 2008, Apple debuted a new trackpad that users could click anywhere on the surface. Before that, trackpads had included left-click and right-click buttons underneath the touch-cursor portion.\nThe third-generation MacBook Pro included an updated trackpad with a larger surface and pressure-sensitive haptics. Called the Force Touch trackpad, it replaced the mechanical clicking hinge with a haptic motor that approximates a click-through vibration. The trackpad doesn't click or operate without power since it has no moving parts.\n3D Touch was an iPhone feature that popped up extra software options when applying pressure with a click. While Apple removed this from the iPhone, the MacBook trackpad still uses the Mac's equivalent Force Touch system. Apple still ships trackpads with Force Touch built-in, but it isn't emphasized in macOS.\nTouch Bar\nThe controversial fourth-generation MacBook Pro did more to change the keyboard than the butterfly switch \u2014 it also introduced the Touch Bar. The OLED strip replaced the function key row entirely, leading to many user complaints. The Touch Bar includes Touch ID and the T1/T2 coprocessor.\nApple finally discontinued the Touch Bar after ending production of the 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2023.\nThe Touch Bar showed shortcut buttons based on the MacBook Pro's open and active application. Text suggestions, emoji, photo tools, and video timelines pop up depending on what a user is doing.\nAn altered version of watchOS powered the Touch Bar, operating entirely on the T1/T2 chip. This coprocessor also handled full disk encryption and storing Touch ID data.\nPorts\nThe Apple Silicon MacBook Pros have multiple types of ports, a change from Apple's previous move to remove everything other than USB-C and a headphone jack. Now, users will find three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, and an HDMI port on every M4 Macbook Pro.\nBase M4 models get three Thunderbolt 4 ports while M4 Pro and M4 Max models get three Thunderbolt 5 ports.\nThe SD card slot doesn't offer the latest and greatest speeds, instead, it is limited to SDXC type cards. The HDMI port in 2023 models can output to a single 8K monitor at 60Hz or a 4K monitor at 240Hz.\nApple's return to various port types comes after years of customers complaining about needing adapters to make any connection that wasn't USB to USB.\nApple also brought back the MagSafe charging port in the MacBook Pro. This port is MagSafe 3 and can fast charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro at 140W for 50% battery in 30 minutes when an appropriate power adapter is used.\nRetina Display\nThe Liquid Retina XDR Display is found in the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro features a standard Retina Display. The term \"Retina\" is used by Apple for displays with a high pixel density, making individual pixels indiscernible at normal viewing distances.\nThe Liquid Retina XDR Display utilizes mini-LED backlighting to achieve a higher dynamic range and improved black levels. It also features a 120Hz ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate, which presents content at its original frame rate. These advancements contribute to enhancing the overall battery life when viewing specific content.\nM4 MacBook Pro models have a display that can be made much dimmer in dark environments. The display can also reach 1,000 nits for SDR content in bright environments.\nTandem OLED could make its way to MacBook Pro, but it isn't clear how soon given the expensive nature of these panels. The upgrade from mini-LED backlighting would be immense, but costly.\nmacOS Sequoia\nAnnounced at WWDC 2024, macOS Sequoia brings a number of new features to Apple computers. Here are some of the notable updates MacBook Pro owners can expect.\nImproved Window Tiling\nAn improvement has been made to the existing window management features. The window tiling now works similarly to some third-party management apps.\nYou can drag a window to a spot on the screen, and it will automatically reposition itself. For example, placing it on the far edge of a screen can cause it to expand and fill the left half of your MacBook Pro display.\nMessages\nUsers can now add different effects to the text they send to others, such as bold, italics, and underlining. Also, in Messages, users can schedule messages to be sent to contacts at specific times, which is handy for sending out important news, reminders, and time-specific information.\nAdditionally, Tapbacks will have the option to react to messages with emoji.\niPhone mirroring\nUsers can bring their iPhone onto the macOS Sequoia desktop using the new iPhone Mirroring app. The iPhone just needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network and signed into the same Apple ID for the function to work.\nOnce connected, users will see a digital representation of the iPhone on the desktop. Apps can be opened and used with some exceptions.\nApps can't be reorganized and certain system functions aren't available, but otherwise, the iPhone can be operated normally. Any time a mirroring function is active, the iPhone remains locked and the screen is off.\nThe iPhone mirroring function relies on Continuity, which can only have one active session at once. So, users can't bring an iPhone into macOS while their Mac display is mirrored into Apple Vision Pro.\nDedicated Passwords app\nAfter incorporating passwords as part of the Keychain integrated into its operating systems, Apple has finally made an app for it. The new Passwords app is used to manage user authentication across Apple's ecosystem of devices.\nThe macOS version is the only one that can import password lists.\nSafari\nA new summarization feature, dubbed Highlights, provides users with a short summary paragraph that is contextually generated based on the webpage they are looking at. This can include details about locations when planning a trip, information about a TV show or movie, and even quick links to other resources.\nA new version of Reader mode has been redesigned with new elements, including a table of contents and a summary of the article.\nDistraction Control was introduced later in the macOS Sequoia beta cycle. It allows users to hide distracting elements in Safari, but it doesn't function as an ad blocker.\nApple Intelligence\nApple Intelligence is Apple's attempt to integrate artificial intelligence into its products. As Apple prioritizes security, much of the Apple Intelligence processes occur on the device itself.\nFurthermore, Apple describes Apple Intelligence as \"personal intelligence,\" focusing on enhancing how users interact with the apps and services they already use instead of concentrating on novel use cases.\nApple Intelligence is limited to M-series Macs and iPads, as well as iPhones running the A17 Pro chip and newer. Any MacBook Pro with an M1 or newer can run Apple Intelligence.\nApple made a small set of AI features available to developers with the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta.\nMacBook Pro History\nThe MacBook Pro has been a part of Apple since 2006. Here's how it has changed.\nNew MacBook Pro\nApple updated the MacBook Pro lineup with the M4 family of chips in October 2024. The M5 update likely won't take place until late 2025 or early 2026.\nFifth Generation MacBook Pro\nApple's MacBook Pro has seen many changes over the years, and one of the biggest arrived in late 2020. The fifth-generation MacBook Pro launched in November 2020 with custom Apple Silicon inside. The machine abandoned Intel processors in favor of the M1.\nThe fact that Apple now controls both the hardware and software in the Mac line for the first time means significant performance improvements and better battery life. Apple claims that the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1 chip is up to 2.8 times faster with up to 5 times faster graphics than its early 2020 Intel predecessor.\nSecurity has been significantly improved by introducing a new custom system architecture to the market. No instances of malware or adware have been detected for this product yet.\nApple's innovation with its Apple Silicon is evident in the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which were introduced alongside the updated 16-inch MacBook Pro and 14-inch MacBook Pro. The integrated CPUs and GPUs, sharing a unified memory stack, propel these computers to operate as much as 3.7x faster than the Intel versions, a significant performance boost.\nThis generation also marks the end of the Touch Bar and the introduction of more ports, like HDMI and SD card slots. They use Thunderbolt 4 ports and MagSafe 3 with fast charging capabilities.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro was updated with an M2 processor in 2022, though no other changes were made. The 14-inch and 16-inch models were updated with the M2 Pro and M2 Max in January 2023 with a few minor alterations like Wi-Fi 6E and 8K HDMI output.\nApple discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro in favor of selling the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3. The M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were also launched in October 2023 and are included in MacBook Pros with a new space black color option.\nThe M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max were added to the MacBook Pro lineup in October 2024 with few other changes including Thunderbolt 5 for high end models. The display has brighter SDR up to 1,000 nits, can be dimmed more than before, and customers can add Nano Texture.\nM5 is expected in late 2025 or early 2026 with few other updates beyond chipset.\nFourth Generation MacBook Pro\nThe fourth-generation MacBook Pro was released in October 2016, updating both the 15-inch and 13-inch models. The MacBook Pro hadn't been updated in years, and some pro users voiced their uneasiness about Apple's attention discrepancy between rapidly advancing mobile devices and the stagnating Mac. However, the machine's significant 2016 updates proved more controversial than widely embraced.\nThe ultra-thin MacBook Pro needed the smallest ports available, so it came with USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. They were versatile but new to users who would need adapters or all new equipment to use the port. There was no more MagSafe, but all ports could power the laptop without the need for a proprietary cable.\nHowever, all eyes were on the new generation's keyboard, which had carried over from the 12-inch MacBook. Thinner keys with a butterfly mechanism and less space between them, a touch screen panel instead of a function row, and a giant trackpad all made this design futuristic and new. Apple also added its Touch ID technology in a button next to the Touch Bar that acted as the sleep/wake switch.\nThrough the years, the ports change mattered less as more users got USB accessories to match, but the keyboard didn't live up to Apple's hopes. April of 2018 saw a report that said the butterfly keyboard was failing at up to twice the rate of the previous generations.\nClass-action lawsuits were filed, Apple updated the keyboard with membrane material to prevent foreign object ingress, and a final update to the keyboard in May 2019 changed out materials for stronger ones. Apple also announced a keyboard service program for all the affected MacBooks. These changes have seemed to reduce the need for repair of \"sticky keys,\" but they still weren't enough for users expecting their devices to \"just work.\"\nThe first revision to the fourth-generation MacBook Pro came in November 2019, and along with it, a newly dubbed \"Magic Keyboard.\" Apple brought back the scissor mechanisms and even the physical escape key to finally and hopefully bring the years of keyboard issues to rest. This 16-inch model also included new spec updates to align it with the iMac Pro and increased the battery to the maximum allowed for plane travel, 100W.\nIn May 2020, Apple released a 13-inch update with a new Magic Keyboard, faster processors, and more storage.\nThird Generation MacBook Pro\nAt WWDC 2012, Apple announced a third-generation \"MacBook Pro with Retina display.\" As its name implies, it was the first Apple notebook with a high-resolution screen. It also added Core i7 processors, USB 3.0, a second Thunderbolt port, and HDMI. To further accommodate the thinning of the laptop, Apple added MagSafe 2, which had a thinner connector and port. FireWire 800 and Ethernet were dropped to allow for the new ports, but users could still connect them via thunderbolt adapters.\nThis laptop also lost some moving parts. Apple dropped the disk drive and switched the hard drive to a solid-state drive. The design further removed user upgradeability by soldering in the memory and gluing in the battery.\nThis generation saw more significant user-facing updates than the standard memory or screen changes of previos Macbook Pro models. In 2013, the laptops gained Thunderbolt 2, Iris graphics, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and the higher-end 15-inch model got additional Nvidia graphics. 4K support was added via the HDMI as well.\nThe 2015 update, the last before the current generation, included all of the usual speed updates and some hardware changes. That generation marked the Force Touch trackpad's debut, making for quieter and softer clicks and allowing for deep-press-triggered contextual menus.\nSecond Generation MacBook Pro\nApple announced the second-generation MacBook Pro during a press event in October 2008. A new design, dumping the old PowerBook chassis, sported a unibody aluminum enclosure with tapered edges, like the MacBook Air. The optical drive and ports were rearranged for the new body style: ports on the left and optical drive on the right.\nApple changed ports and dropped FireWire 400, but the FireWire 800 port remained. The update also changed the DVI port to a Mini DisplayPort.\nThis generation allowed users to change their battery out, which is useful for travel or switching in a spare. The battery only lasted about five hours on one charge, so buying an extra allowed the device to last closer to a full day.\nApple added a glass surface trackpad with its new sleek aluminum case. Users could click the new trackpad anywhere, an upgrade over designated buttons below on the first-generation trackpad. Later updates added inertial scrolling, similar to what iOS offered.\nFirst Generation MacBook Pro\nAmong the first Intel Macs, the first-generation MacBook Pro arrived in January 2006 with a 15-inch screen. Apple launched a larger 17-inch variant in April. These were the first MacBooks with webcams. They also introduced the MagSafe connector.\nThe move from PowerPC to Intel was much faster than anyone, even Apple had anticipated. The process went without too many hitches, and it proved to be up to three times as fast as the PowerBook G4 it replaced.\nMacBook Pro \u2014 Pricing\nRetail MacBook Pro price points start at $1,599, but discounts are readily available in our Mac Price Guide, knocking hundreds of dollars off nearly every configuration.\nJump straight to the product line of your choice:\nCurrent models\n- M4 14-inch MacBook Pro prices\n- M4 Pro and M4 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro prices\n- M4 Pro and M4 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro prices"
