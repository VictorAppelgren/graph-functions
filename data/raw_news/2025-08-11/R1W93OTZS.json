  "description": "Hint: He just spent billions to acquire the guys who worked on the model being called 'underwhelming.'",
  "content": "The biggest loser from OpenAI's new GPT-5 Model isn't who you think originally appeared on TheStreet. AI enthusiasts had been hopped up on the hopium that creator OpenAI would achieve a major breakthrough with GPT-5, the latest installment of the software behind ChatGPT. But if the social media reception thus far is any indication, it appears more that GPT-5 is breaking brains, rather than expectations. That's because, by most accounts, the GPT-5 hype train has derailed; expectations were far too great and the results are too few. For years, CEO Sam Altman and his crack team of AI engineers hyped up GPT-5 as if it would be a fantastic leap in the grand scheme of AI models. Its coming was augured as borderline biblical among the San Fran-centric tech elite. In highly-online circles, AI accelerationists joked that there were just \"two years left\" to make money and \"escape the permanent underclass\" before OpenAI's long-awaited model launched and took all our jobs. Since GPT-5 launched, the tone has shifted. Many of those same boosters are backtracking, seemingly a little less sure about the timeline to artificial general intelligence (AGI), the kind of AI that can take on human tasks and learn without much intervention. That's not to say that the model isn't a form of progress, but to many, the new GPT-5 model is seen as a downgrade. That's got to be a disappointment, but there's arguably somebody who lost even bigger than OpenAI in all of this. We'll give you a hint: he just spent billions to hire many of the forefathers of the now-criticized model. In June, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on a hiring spree, spending $14.3 billion to buy a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data labeling and model evaluation software. Really, it wasn't Scale AI that Zucc really wanted. It was CEO Alexandr Wang, who now leads the company's 'Superintelligence' division. That big buy preceded a series of big buys by Meta's top dog, who was soon on the prowl for top AI talent. Blank checks in tow, Zuckerberg raided the cabinets of competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and smaller AI labs like Thinking Machine Labs. He reportedly offered one researcher at the latter up to $1.5 billion in compensation in exchange for six years of work. However, many hires came from OpenAI. Their departure signaled, at least to the AI-enthused, that AGI or a more omniscient super intelligence (ASI) was likely still years away. But as fate would have it, many of those poached away by Meta were almost certainly involved in GPT-5. Based on what they were seeing, surely they knew as much.\n\nAnd so the researchers took the money, joined Meta, and OpenAI released its most underwhelming model in as many years. You'd have to think that Mark isn't too happy about that. Maybe the singular silver lining is that it sets the bar low for whatever Meta is working on right now. But aside from the massive spending on talent, Meta's AI aspirations are running into another wall: their cash and cash equivalents. During the pandemic, Zuckerberg went all-in on the metaverse, positioning Meta for an AR and VR-driven future. It was so sold on the opportunity, it even changed its corporate name to Meta, reflecting its embrace of the technology. The Reality Labs division of the company \u2014 which encompassed everything from its Oculus VR headset, its new Ray-Ban AR glasses, and the lesser-known Horizon Worlds online platform \u2014 has cost Meta over $50 billion since its rebrand in Aug. 2020. A few years later, it's hard not to compare Meta's newfound embrace of AI to Reality Labs. It's similarly costly and the company is all-in. It might be less cavalier about the business opportunity here, because if AI does eventually work out, companies attached to the tech might make a lot of money. But for the moment, it's hard to ignore that 'AI technology' (large language models, for the most part) lose gobs of money. That goes for OpenAI, Anthropic, and also Meta. It's a lesser-discussed component of its earnings, which were lauded by investors. But check out the balance sheet and you'll see the cash has almost gone. Six months ago, the company had $43.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Come Jun. 30, they had $12 billion. Most of that has migrated to the Property and equipment section, implying that this cash is being invested in buildout. But there's reason to worry about overbuild, at least if you take Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at his word. Still, as if burning through $31.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents in the last six months wasn't already cause for hysterics, the company is looking for more dry powder. It recently struck a $29 billion private credit deal, seeking to continue scaling. Could Meta really crack the code? Of course, all this spending likely means little if Meta makes it to artificial general intelligence (AGI) first. Though, there's still some conjecture if that's possible with the current angle of attack employed by leading AI labs (that is, training large language models). Even if investors are onboard with the potentially years-long commitment of capital and time, you'd have to imagine they'd want to start to see evidence of scale from the technology. At the least, some sort of indication that this is going to start paying off long before the AI can do everything that its boosters swear by it to. Maybe in this market, with valuations at record highs, there is increased tolerance for the timeline. There is hopium aplenty right now. But as AI agents struggle to breakthrough in enterprise settings and leading AI models remain wildly unprofitable, you'd have to expect that the seemingly infinite amounts of money being thrown into AI will eventually have to pale some sort of payoff. That would mean more expensive credits and less access to the technology, unless AI upstarts can find unlimited processing power and energy sources to bring the \"cost of intelligence\" down to zero. Right now, much of this is subsidized by the venture capital class. (And at Meta and Google, the cost is being subsidized by ad businesses, likely some indication of where the tech is inevitably going.) If the payoff isn't painfully obvious soon, maybe you start to see some investors revolt next year. After all, every dollar expended on capex is a dollar not spent on dividends and share buybacks. That might be okay for now, but with Meta up 27% year-to-date, one has to wonder how long investors will actually have to wait for the future to finally arrive.

We saw some minor sell signals on August 1, but they have been erased. The major indices rallied last week, albeit in choppy fashion, with up days on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and down days on Tuesday and Thursday. The sell signals and warnings that we had on August 1 included a bearish crossover of the five-day- and 13-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), a break of the 21-day EMA, and the cycling of the Vortex indicator into negative territory. In addition, price volatility picked up following the July 31 bearish reversal, and that can be a bad sign after a big advance. The 21-day rate of change (ROC) got very close to cycling into negative territory before popping last week. We still have two bearish divergences on the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) after cycling into extreme overbought territory -- a warning, but not a sell signal. For now, it looks like the major indices could be at the start of another leg higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) just missing a closing all-time high on Friday and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 reaching closing highs. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for the SPX remains bullish, but is bearish for the Nasdaq 100. The data for the volatility index (VIX) is bullish, suggesting we could see another move higher and then an eventual pullback in the stock market.

      "text": "OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 model was meant to be a world-changing upgrade to its wildly popular and precocious chatbot. But for some users, last Thursday\u2019s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.\nOn Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, \u201cand the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.\u201d He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5\u2019s performance and the overall user experience.\nGiven the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.\nOpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)\nSoon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn\u2019t feel the same. It\u2019s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,\u201d wrote one member of the community in a thread titled \u201cKill 4o isn\u2019t innovation, it\u2019s erasure.\u201d\n\u201cSure, 5 is fine\u2014if you hate nuance and feeling things,\u201d another Reddit user wrote.\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable \u201cthinking mode.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,\u201d the CEO wrote on X. \u201cAs we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!\u201d\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n| Got a Tip? |\n|---|\n| Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01. |\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\u201cIt seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more \u201cbusiness\u201d and less chatty,\u201d says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. \u201cI personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.\u201d\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\u201cA lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn\u2019t describe it that way,\u201d Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be \u201cunknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.\u201d"
