      "feedback": "Strong start anchored in 0–3 week drivers (Fed path via Powell’s hint and pricing of an 85% Sep cut from 17F49LURJ; Nvidia as AI proxy; Santos’ semi-annual metrics) but the piece needs a tighter, source-grounded causal chain and explicit near‑term thresholds. Convert into a four‑part 0–3w frame: (1) immediate drivers and catalysts (Powell’s rate‑cut signal with 85% odds; Nvidia earnings as AI exposure bellwether; Santos’ Darwin/Barossa/Pikka milestones); cite each claim to the exact ID (17F49LURJ for the rate‑cut odds, S1OY7ISLY for Santos milestones). (2) transmission and positioning (rate‑cut optimism lifting equities; energy names driven by Barossa readiness and Pikka oil timing; private‑market funding pullback feeding risk premia—MW3AO9NFK supports the latter); attach sources per assertion. (3) explicit thresholds and invalidation (e.g., if Sep cut odds fail to hold near 60–70% or Nvidia guidance disappoints, or Santos misses first‑oil timing to 2026; if Intel stake/intel‑policy signals alter disruption risk; reference 218AGGUXB for policy/inflation debates). (4) monitoring list and scenario scaffolding (three scenarios: base: gradual rally on rate‑cut path; upside: stronger AI/corporate capex; downside: tariff/reflation surprises); ensure all factuals (Barossa 98% complete; Darwin ready‑for‑start; Pikka first oil Q1 2026; Arch/Mubadala deal sourcing hits) are pulled from S1OY7ISLY and MW3AO9NFK. Also separate opinion from Krugman/rawstory content (218AGGUXB) from data, and clearly mark policy/energy versus macro‑cyclic narratives. Quantify every claim drawn from sources (e.g., Santos FCF US$1.1b; LNG US$11.57/mmbtu; interim dividend US$0.134; Barossa 98% complete; target private‑credit fund ~$1b with <50% raised) and recast the conclusion as a probability‑weighted stance rather than a single base case. Finally, tighten the prose so the causal chain is explicit, and map each assertion to its source ID in‑line (e.g., 17F49LURJ, S1OY7ISLY, MW3AO9NFK, 218AGGUXB, LLN6N4H3Z) to satisfy density, coverage, and reconciliation needs.",
