  "description": "Despite Democratic lawmakers fleeing and holding up vital relief efforts, Texas Governor Abbott\u2019s flood relief was faster than California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s response to the L.A. wildfires.",
  "content": "Despite Democratic lawmakers fleeing and holding up vital relief efforts, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s flood relief was faster than California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s response to the L.A. wildfires.This weekend, Abbott helped to present more than 60 of the families most impacted by the catastrophic floods in the Texas Hill Country with $25,000 relief checks, which the governor called an initial \"down payment\" on the relief still incoming.In an interview with Fox News Digital, Abbott explained the funds were a result of Texas partnering with country music legend George Strait and other private groups to ensure that funds raised by the star went straight to those who suffered the worst damage.Abbott said that both he and Strait agreed there is a \"need for speed to help these people as quickly as possible.\"ABBOTT VOWS INDEFINITE SPECIAL SESSIONS, SAYS FLEEING DEMS COULD FACE ARREST \u2018FOR LITERALLY YEARS\u2019\"We've seen in other states when there's been travesties that occurred there, like the fires in California, and so much money was raised and never has gotten to the people who needed it, we want to make sure that did not happen in the state of Texas,\" Abbott explained.\"There has been an outpouring of support to Texas organizations to help the people of this state,\" he added. \"Now our job is to make sure it gets into the hands of the people who need it the most.\" This comes just over a month after much of central Texas suffered a devastating flood that killed over 100 and decimated homes and businesses.In response to the suffering, Strait, a Texas native, held a concert on July 27 to raise funds for those most impacted. Just two weeks later, victims are already receiving relief checks from the concert.Abbott said that Strait was insistent that \"he was doing this for one reason, because he was sick and tired of the people who've been damaged and harmed the most by the storm are not getting the money they need.\"CALIFORNIA LAUNCHES REDISTRICTING FIGHT TO \u2018NULLIFY\u2019 TEXAS GOP PLAN, WITH DEMS POISED TO GAIN 5 SEATS\"So, what we did we set up an operation to make sure we were able to identify who sustained the worst damage, then make sure that they would be on the receiving end of these checks,\" he explained.Strait\u2019s concert closely resembles a similar star-studded benefit concert, titled \"FireAid,\" in California that raised more than $100 million for victims of the wildfires in Los Angeles.FireAid billed itself as \"a benefit concert for wildfire victims.\" Aside from music by the likes of Lady Gaga, Jelly Roll, Katy Perry and Olivia Rodrigo, the five-hour show featured multiple stories from victims of the Altadena and Palisades fire who had lost their homes.Fox News Digital reported in July that six months later, victims in the city\u2019s most impacted neighborhoods still had not received any direct funds raised by the concert. In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for FireAid told Fox News Digital that \"to most effectively deliver aid to the community as quickly as possible, we partnered with vetted and trusted local nonprofits who had the capacity and infrastructure to directly reach the individuals in need.\"The spokesperson said \"this assistance provided food security, housing, resources for schools and more directly to individuals in the affected communities.\"TRUMP AND NEWSOM FIGHT OVER NATIONAL GUARD HEADS TO TRIAL IN CALIFORNIAThey said that to date, FireAid has \"distributed two rounds of funding totaling close to $75 million to organizations helping people on the ground and expect to distribute the remaining $25 million by the end of the year.\" \"The funds address the urgent needs from individuals in our communities\u2014 from immediate financial assistance, to childcare, groceries, mental health and housing and rebuilding public spaces as well as fire prevention. The grants have been distributed to more than 160 frontline nonprofits, schools, and local organizations which were identified and selected by FireAid,\" said the spokesperson. Abbott claimed that several factors have made Texas\u2019 response to the flooding disaster very different from California\u2019s.\"It starts with generosity \u2026 but the second thing is we don't let things slow us down. We are very empathetic with those who have lost their homes, who've had their lives turned upside down, who are trying to get back into their homes,\" he said. \"So, we were able to cut through all the red tape and make sure that the money got into the hands of those who needed it the most.\"He went on to say that \"now we're working with the local governments to make sure these people are going to be able to take these dollars, these resources, and actually begin that construction process to get their homes rebuilt.\"This comes despite the governor\u2019s ongoing showdown with Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives, who fled the state and brought the legislature\u2019s efforts to pass new flood relief measures to a grinding halt. The Democrats fled the state in protest of redistricting plans that would potentially give Republicans five additional seats in Congress.GOV. GREG ABBOTT THREATENS TO REDISTRICT 8 SEATS FOR GOP IF DEM LAWMAKERS DON'T RETURN TO TEXASThe governor and other state leaders, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and House Leader Dustin Burrows, both Republicans, have filed legal action to arrest the rogue lawmakers and have threatened to remove them from their offices. Thus far, however, the Democrats have been able to evade Texas authorities and hold up any progress by denying the state House the necessary quorum to pass legislation.\"We're able to give that to the victims, even though we have Democrats who've fled the state and been dishonorable to our state,\" said Abbott, adding, \"One thing about Texans is we stand and fight if we have principles we want to fight on. And what these Democrats have done, they fled the state, and that's very un-Texan on their part.\"He went on to say that \"we\u2019ll get the financial resources to those who need it, but also we're working to provide greater assistance for them in the meantime.\"\"That said, there are laws that need to be passed, such as creating early warning systems, such as making sure we change what the rules are in the flood zones, and things like that. That's going to require these Democrats showing back up and casting a vote,\" he explained.WATCH: TRUMP SAYS FBI 'MAY HAVE TO' HELP TEXAS ROUND UP AWOL DEM LAWMAKERS\"Know that the gears of government to improve the response to this disaster are being slowed down and denied because Democrats are not showing up and doing their job,\" he went on. \"So, despite the fact that we have a bunch of cowardly Democrats who turned tail and ran out of state and right here to do their job, my main focus that I put my time and attention to is helping out the flood victims of this tragedy to make sure they're getting the resources they need and so we can accelerate the rebuilding process to get their lives back to normal as quickly as possible.\"A spokesperson for Newsom\u2019s office directed Fox News Digital to a press conference he held with several Texas Democrats, including state Rep. Ann Johnson, who claimed during the event that Democratic lawmakers \"waited to address that issue\" of flood relief for two weeks but that \"they only put one bill up for us to debate in the House and it was redistricting.\"\"We have an arrest warrant for us to go back to Texas for one bill only. They don\u2019t want us to come back for flooding,\" said Johnson.She accused Republicans of \"using those families as a distraction,\" saying, \"the governor can write a check right now to try to start the process and so its his decision what\u2019s valuable to him.\"Johnson suggested that Democrats \"will gladly show up\" to address flooding, school testing, human trafficking or court infrastructure but not for the redistricting vote. Fox News Digital also reached out to the Texas House Democratic Caucus for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.",

      "text": "The star-studded benefit concert that raised more than $100 million dollars for wildfire victims in California is itself under fire for how the money was spent.\n\"I have not seen any benefit from the FireAid money, and I am very involved here and neither have my neighbors,\" said David Howard, who lost two homes in Pacific Palisades.\nFireAid billed itself as \"a benefit concert for wildfire victims.\" Aside from music by the likes of Lady Gaga, Jelly Roll, Katy Perry and Olivia Rodrigo, the five-hour show featured multiple stories from victims of the Altadena and Palisades fire who'd lost their homes.\n\"My house is gone,\" Altadena fire victim Mark Jones told the audience. Six months later, Jones told Fox 11 in Los Angeles he expected someone to reach out and provide help, but that didn't happen. Did Jones believe he would receive money? \"I did, and I am sure with most Altadenians. The fire aid was for us. So, we figured where is the money? Where is it going?\"\nFox News asked that question Wednesday of FireAid and the Annenberg Foundation, which helped put the concert together.\n- Did any non-profits receive money? If so, how much did each receive?\n- How many fire victims received aid?\n- How much aid or financial assistance was paid to the victims?\n- What accounting practices were adopted to prevent FireAid money from being co-mingled with other operating funds among those non-profits receiving money?\nWe have yet to receive a response, but officials acknowledged receiving our inquiry.\nThe FireAid website says the concert raised an estimated $100 million designated for \"direct relief\".\nDuring the concert, host and actor Miles Teller told viewers \"all the money raised will go directly to people who need it now and long-term efforts to build it back.\"\nCELEBRITIES, CORPORATIONS OPEN WALLETS AFTER DEADLY FLOOD IN TEXAS HILL COUNTRY\nThat was echoed by host and actor Samuel L. Jackson, who said, \"Go to the website and give what you can. All the money will go directly to people who need help in the short term and the long-term effort to get this city back on its feet.\"\nBut last week, in a statement to the Fox affiliate in Los Angeles, the charity said, \"FireAid does not have the capability to make direct payments to individuals and that was never the plan. We partnered directly with trusted local non-profits...to reach communities in need.\"\nFox News contacted more than 70 of those non-profits. Some replied. Others declined. Some are well known like the Boys and Girls Club, YWCA and Meals on Wheels.\nOthers are more obscure or promised to help specific ethnic groups or artists.\nOne that promoted \"self-determination in the Latino community\" vowed to use their FireAid grant to create \"a more humane and democratic society by responding to the needs and problems of disenfranchised people.\"\nAnother claimed to use natural helpers or 'promotores' to \"cultivate egalitarian relationships based on trust and respect.\"\nLOS ANGELES POLICE HOPE TO REUNITE FIREARM OWNERS WITH GUNS AFTER DEVASTATING PALISADES FIRE\nAt least $6.5 million in donor money also went to the County of Los Angeles.\nAll told, FireAid says it has granted $75 million so far to 188 non-profits. The remaining $25 million should go out in August and will focus on \"long-term wildfire mitigation, environmental resilience, and sustainable rebuilding,\" according to the group.\nThe LA Times this week published an extensive piece on FireAid funding, contacting 100 non-profits receiving aid. It said the money provided a lifeline to many groups, allowing them to provide food, shelter, mental health services and animal care.\nSo who exactly who is responsible for how the money is spent? That's not entirely clear. The Annenberg Foundation helped organize the concert but claims only an advisory role in how the money is spent.\nAn Annenberg spokesperson says spending decisions are made by the FireAid Advisory Committee made up of respected philanthropists. They make recommendations to the FireAid Board of Trustees. It includes several executives from the LA Clipper basketball team, a businessman and wife of a prominent media executive.\nWhile there is no evidence of fraud, California Congressman Kevin Kiley wants U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate \"where these donations went and who benefited.\"\nWe asked fire victim David Howard if the thought that was necessary.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"100%,\" he said. \"No question. We need to get to the bottom of where the money is going. A lot of money is going to non-profits in a lot of different areas and it's not going to where it needs to.\""

      "text": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday evening that the FBI \"may have to\" round up a group of Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to avoid voting on the state\u2019s proposed redistricting map.\nThis comes as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and several Texas leaders, including Attorney General Ken Paxton, have demanded that the 50 Democratic members of the state legislature who fled the state return or face consequences.\nThe Democrats fled the state in an effort to deny Republicans the necessary two-thirds quorum required to vote on the redistricting map, which would likely give the GOP an edge in elections and potentially add five House seats to the Texas Republican congressional delegation.\nNational Democrats have praised the stunt. During a press conference on Sunday, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a leading Democratic figure, shared his support for the Texas Democrats, describing their departure as a \"righteous act of courage,\" while claiming Republicans want to silence \"millions of voices, especially Black and Latino voters.\"\nFBI URGED TO LOCATE OR ARREST TEXAS DEMOCRATS WHO FLED STATE TO STALL REDISTRICTING VOTE\nAbbott said the lawmakers\u2019 commitment to voting as elected state officials is a duty and is \"not optional.\" The governor also said a legislator determined to have \"forfeited his or her office due to abandonment\" can be removed from office under the Texas Constitution, thereby creating a vacancy, which the governor can \"swiftly fill\" under Article III, Section 13.\nAfter the Democrats failed to meet Abbott's 4 p.m. CT Monday deadline to return, Texas Speaker of the House Dustin Burrows announced he would sign arrest warrants against any absent Democrat lawmakers if authorized by a vote of the chamber. Shortly thereafter, the House did approve the warrants and Abbott then swiftly called on the Texas Department of Public Safety to arrest the \"delinquent Texas House Democrats.\"\nThe attorney general has stated that the lawmakers \"should be found and arrested no matter where they go.\"\nTrump weighed in on the political intrigue Tuesday at the White House when he was asked by a reporter, \"Do you want the federal government and the FBI to help locate and arrest these Texas Democrats who have left the state?\"\nThe president responded that it is a bad look for Democrats to \"abandon\" the state rather than fight it out in the legislature.\n\"Well, I think they've abandoned the state,\" he said. \"Nobody's seen anything like it, even though they've done it twice before. And, in a certain way, it almost looks like they've abandoned the state. Looks very bad.\"\nPressed further on whether the FBI should get involved, Trump answered, \"Well, they may have to.\"\n\"They may have to,\" he repeated. \"No, I know they want them back. Not only the attorney general, the governor wants them back. If you look, I mean the governor of Texas is demanding they come back. So, a lot of people are demanding they come back.

      "text": "The fight between President Donald Trump and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over the National Guard's presence in California is coming to a head on Monday in the start of a three-day trial.\nGovernment attorneys are set to argue that Trump had legal authority to deploy roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June to assist with anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests and riots.\nWhile most of the National Guard members have since been demobilized, the trial could set the stage for more fights across the country as Trump federalizes guard members in Washington, D.C., and threatens to do so elsewhere in response to high crime rates in blue cities.\nJudge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee and brother of retired liberal Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, is presiding over the case.\nTRUMP AND NEWSOM ON COLLISION COURSE AS FIGHT OVER NATIONAL GUARD INTENSIFIES IN COURT\nBreyer previously granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Newsom, saying Trump's decision to mobilize the National Guard was illegal because it infringed on California's authority. One of the conditions required under the law Trump cited to federalize the National Guard is that a rebellion must be underway, and Breyer said the riots in California fell far short of that scenario.\nBut Breyer's decision was quickly reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A three-judge panel for the appellate court unanimously found that the courts have limited ability to review whether a president has properly invoked the law to federalize the National Guard.\n\"We are persuaded that, under longstanding precedent interpreting the statutory predecessor to \u00a712406, our review of that decision must be highly deferential,\" the panel wrote. \"Affording the President that deference, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under \u00a712406(3), which authorizes federalization of the National Guard when \u2018the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\u2019\"\nThe panel paused Breyer's initial order indefinitely, but Monday's trial is the next step in the court process as the judge weighs the merits of the case.\nWhile little is left on the ground in California for the judge to resolve \u2013 Newsom recently announced that about 300 of Trump's deployed National Guard members remain active in the state \u2013 legal questions surrounding Trump's actions persist.\nAs part of the trial, Breyer will examine the 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from being used for civil matters. Newsom has argued Trump violated that law and plans to call military officials as witnesses during the trial to testify about the directions the National Guard and a few hundred Marines received.\nNewsom has said they were illegally engaged in law enforcement activities, while government attorneys argue they were protecting federal personnel and federal properties.\nAPPEALS COURT APPEARS SKEPTICAL OF NEWSOM'S CLAIM THAT TRUMP ILLEGALLY DEPLOYED NATIONAL GUARD\nWhile Newsom also argued that Trump's unusual decision to bring the National Guard into a state without the governor's consent was illegal and required the governor's permission, the three-judge panel has already leaned in favor of Trump on that point.\nThe panel found that while the law's language, which states that Trump must go \"through\" the governor, could mean the president committed a \"procedural\" violation, it did not warrant restricting Trump's use of the military.\nNewsom has claimed more broadly that militarizing California was unnecessary and caused the unrest in Los Angeles to intensify.\nState and local law enforcement officers made about seven riot-related arrests prior to Trump's announcement about the National Guard on June 7, but they made about a thousand arrests during the subsequent 10 days, California attorneys said in court filings.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAn ICE official said in an affidavit that National Guard members were \"essential\" to providing reinforcements around the 300 North Los Angeles Federal Building, which was the site of protests during the controversial immigration raids.\n\"Prior to the National Guard's deployment, rioters and protestors assaulted federal, state, and local law enforcement officers with rocks, fireworks, and other objects. They also damaged federal property by spray painting death threats to federal law enforcement officers,\" the ICE official wrote."

Greg Abbott warned state Democrats that the threat of arrest upon returning to Texas will last \"for literally years\" on Sunday.\nAbbott made the statement during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" with host Shannon Bream. He argued it is within his authority to keep the Texas legislature in a special session indefinitely, extending the penalties for Democrats who fled the state.\n\"I'm authorized to call a special session every 30 days. It lasts 30 days. And as soon as this one is over, I'm gonna call another one, then another one, then another, then another one,\" Abbott said.\n\"If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol. If they want to evade that arrest, they're gonna have to stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years,\" he added.\nTEXAS DEMOCRATS FLEE STATE TO BLOCK TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING VOTE IN DRAMATIC LEGISLATIVE MOVE\nThe warning comes as Abbott is seeking to remove delinquent Democrats from office, arguing they have abdicated their roles under the state constitution.\n\"We have a situation where lawmakers are violating the law in Article 3 of the Texas Constitution where they are required to act on bills. Because they're violating that constitutional mandate, that means they are not fulfilling their oath of office, and they can be removed from office in this legal action that I'm taking,\" he said.\nTRUMP, REPUBLICANS RACE TO REDRAW TEXAS CONGRESSIONAL MAP AS DEMOCRATS THREATEN LEGAL WAR\nAt least 100 members of the 150-member Texas House must be present to conduct business, and approximately 50 of the Democrats have left. Abbott says their commitment to voting as elected state officials is a duty and is \"not optional.\"\nCOLBERT CONFRONTS JB PRITZKER WITH MAP SHOWING ILLINOIS GERRYMANDERING\nMost of the Democrats have set up in Illinois and New York, where they have received the backing of Democratic governors J.B. Pritzker and Kathy Hochul, respectively.\nAlongside Abbott's extended threat of arrest, the Republican governor has also threatened to increase the redistricting margin for his party if lawmakers don't return to Austin.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"What I'm thinking now is that if they don't start showing up, I may start expanding,\" Abbott said during an appearance on the \"Ruthless\" podcast. \"We may make it six or seven or eight new seats we're going to be adding on the Republican side.\"\nFox News' Joseph Wulfsohn contributed to this report"

      "text": "As the controversy surrounding Texas\u2019s redistricting efforts still rages, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Friday that the Golden State will move forward with a plan for a special election in early November to place its own redistricting plan on a ballot measure before voters.\nNewsom said the move was a counterpunch to Texas and was being done in a transparent fashion, but would also likely see Democrats pick up five seats if the measure is adopted. The plan would allow Democrats to temporarily bypass the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission and adopt a new congressional map ahead of the 2026 elections.\n\"We are talking about emergency measures to respond to what\u2019s happening in Texas and we will nullify what happens in Texas,\" Newsom said at a Friday press conference flanked by several California lawmakers and some Texas Democrats who fled their state.\n\"We\u2019ll pick up five seats with the consent of the people. And that\u2019s the difference between the approach we\u2019re taking and the approach they\u2019re taking,\" Newsom continued. \"We\u2019re doing it on a temporary basis. We\u2019re doing it in a fully transparent way and we\u2019re doing it by asking the people of the state of California for their consent and support.\"\nCalifornia would be the first Democratic-led state to actively begin the process of passing new congressional district lines ahead of the 2026 midterms in response to Texas\u2019s redistricting push.\nNewsom said Democrats have until Aug. 22 to get the measure on the ballot and he railed against President Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in justifying the move.\n\"Greg Abbott, who doesn't have the courage, doesn't have the backbone, doesn't have a conscience of the consequences of his actions... is dialing now for new seats,\" Newsom said Friday, referring to the Texas governor\u2019s push for a mid-decade redistricting map and a call with President Trump.\n\"[Trump\u2019s] agenda is failing. His presidency has failed. He knows the headwinds in a midterm. He's dialing for seats now.\"\nTexas Republicans, encouraged by the Trump administration, are pursuing a congressional map aimed at adding up to five GOP-leaning districts, prompting fierce backlash and counteraction. Texas Democrats have fled the Lone Star State to Democrat-stronghold states to break quorum and halt the vote.\nThe Texas House requires a quorum of two-thirds of members present to conduct official business and state lawmakers have reported they plan to be absent from the state until the end of August, when the special session ends.\nTexas Democrats argue that their state\u2019s redistricting plan is unconstitutional and nakedly partisan.\nPelosi defended the Texas walkout, calling it \"self-defense for our democracy.\"\nShe said Democrats will not let Trump \"pave over\" free and fair elections in the country.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTexas Speaker of the House Dustin Burrows signed arrest warrants for the absent Democrats on Monday, following the state House approving of such warrants and Gov. Greg Abbott calling on the Texas Department of Public Safety to arrest the \"delinquent Texas House Democrats.\" The arrest warrants are largely viewed as symbolic as they only apply to those within state lines.\nCalifornia State Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat, said maps would be available to view next week.\n\"Once these maps are released, voters will have the opportunity to digest these maps, review them for weeks and months leading to this election,\" he said.\nFox News\u2019 Emma Colton and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott has expedited flood relief efforts for victims of recent catastrophic floods, providing $25,000 checks to over 60 affected families, in contrast to the slower response to California's wildfire relief efforts. Abbott's initiative, supported by country music star George Strait, aims to ensure that funds reach those in need quickly, avoiding the pitfalls seen in California's FireAid concert, which raised over $100 million but has faced criticism for its distribution process. Meanwhile, Texas Democrats have fled the state to block redistricting efforts, prompting Abbott to threaten arrest and extend special legislative sessions indefinitely.",
