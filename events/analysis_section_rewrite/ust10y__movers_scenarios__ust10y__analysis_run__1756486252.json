      "feedback": "Your draft captures the right drivers but misses the required canonical‑handle mapping, explicit “What to watch” clause, and precise catalyst windows. 1️⃣ For the margin‑recovery Up, add “spx/ndx” after the driver, insert a “What to watch” sentence (e.g., “Q3 2026 earnings release confirming 8.9 % margin expansion”), and keep the 60 % probability only if you can cite the 8.8 % CAGR and 8.9 % margin data from H86O3XRUJ. 2️⃣ For the AI‑platform Up, map to “spx/ndx” and “ust10y” (since AI lift offsets rate drag), add a “What to watch” clause (e.g., “Q3 2026 earnings confirming AI‑native platform revenue share > 15 %”), and tighten the probability to 55 % citing the 80 % workforce upskilling from H86O3XRUJ. 3️⃣ For the Fed‑rate‑hike Down, explicitly reference “ust10y” and “spx/ndx”, add “What to watch” (e.g., “Fed Q1 2026 policy meeting announcing a 1‑point hike”), and keep the 5 % valuation drop figure from H86O3XRUJ; probability can stay at 50 % but note the 10 bp term‑premium compression from VDO8D9T7M. 4️⃣ For the wage‑inflation Down, map to “spx/ndx” and “ust10y” (since higher costs compress margins), add “What to watch” (e.g., “Wage‑inflation data from delivery centers > 3 % in Q3 2026”), and reduce the probability to 45 % citing the risk‑side note in H86O3XRUJ. Ensure each line follows the exact “Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %” format, keep all clauses within one sentence, and avoid any mention of unrelated assets or macro themes.",
