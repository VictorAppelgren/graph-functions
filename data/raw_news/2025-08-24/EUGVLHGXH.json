  "content": "SINGAPORE, Aug. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Once seen as a fringe subculture, trading card game (TCG) collectors have stepped into the global spotlight, shaping mainstream culture, commerce, and community.\n\nRiding this wave, TCG Unite, Asia's first fully functional all-in-one TCG marketplace app, marks a breakthrough for the region's TCG community by combining a comprehensive marketplace with in-app features including:\n\u2022 Portfolio Value Tracking \u2013 Monitor the value of your card collection.\n\u2022 Integrated Logistics \u2013 End-to-end shipping via DHL, SingPost, or self-collection in Singapore; similar arrangements are being explored in Japan and Malaysia to facilitate cross-border trading.\n\u2022 Escrow and Dispute Resolution \u2013 Safe custody of funds with transparent dispute resolution processes to facilitate refunds.\n\nThe TCG Unite app will formally be unveiled at the company's inaugural launch event on 30 August at SingPost Centre, with the ticketed event already experiencing sell-out demand. More than 700 attendees are anticipated at the on-ground event, with one of the main draws being a Card Show which will feature an unprecedented app-only mode of transacting, as well as app-exclusive discount vouchers of up to 10% off card purchases.\n\nTCG Unite was founded by a team whose collective experience spans decades across MNCs, high-growth SMEs, and entrepreneurial ventures. The group saw an opportunity to tackle two persistent challenges in the TCG scene: widespread fraud in the digital age and the absence of a trusted hub for Asia's diverse TCG community.\n\nCOO Mango Teo remarked: \"As TCG enthusiasts ourselves, we thoroughly understand the pain points faced by various sub-communities. That drives us to make TCG trading more secure and accessible, with fairer prices across the board. The TCG Unite app, with proprietary features such as a handcrafted card info database, has been more than a year in development, and its upcoming formal launch is testament to our hard work. App registration rates have been encouraging, and we will not stop in our quest to create the perfect TCG trading experience for hobbyists in Asia and beyond.\"\n\nTCG Unite is a cross-border app marketplace and community platform built by trading card game (TCG) enthusiasts \u2014 for TCG enthusiasts. Headquartered in Singapore, we exist to solve several problems the global TCG scene has long had to deal with: fragmented ecosystems, limited access to geographically restricted collectibles, unreliable pricing data, and fraudulent transactions.",
