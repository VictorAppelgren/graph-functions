  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nShipping Nvidia's H20 chips to China was \"great\" for Beijing and Washington and not a security threat, the tech giant's chief said Friday.\n\nThe California-based company produces some of the world's most advanced semiconductors but cannot ship its most cutting-edge chips to China due to concerns from Washington that Beijing could use them to enhance military capabilities.\n\nNvidia developed the H20 -- a less powerful version of its AI processing units -- specifically for export to China.\n\nThat plan stalled when the Trump administration tightened export licensing requirements in April.\n\nThe H20 was \"not a national security concern,\" Jensen Huang told reporters in Taipei, describing the chip as \"great for America\" and \"great for the Chinese market.\"\n\nHuang insisted there were \"no security backdoors\" in the H20 chip allowing remote access, after China summoned company representatives to discuss security issues.\n\n\"We have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors, there are no such things, there never has, and so hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\" Huang said.\n\nHe sidestepped a question about reports that Nvidia would pay the United States 15% of its revenues from the sale of H20 chips to China, which US President Donald Trump confirmed last week.\n\nInstead, Huang expressed gratitude to the Trump administration for allowing the chips to be shipped to the Chinese market.\n\n\"The demand I believe is quite great and so the ability to ship products to, H20s to China, is very much appreciated,\" the CEO said.\n\nHuang also said Nvidia is in talks with the US government about a new chip for China.\n\n\"Offering a new product to China for the data center, AI data centers, the follow on to H20, that's not our decision to make. It's up to of course the United States government, and we're in dialog with them but it's too soon to know,\" he said.\n\nHuang met with Trump at the White House this month and agreed to give the federal government the cut from its revenues, a highly unusual arrangement in the international tech trade, according to reports in the Financial Times, Bloomberg and The New York Times.\n\nInvestors are betting that AI will transform the global economy, and last month Nvidia -- the world's most valuable company and a leading designer of high-end AI chips -- became the first company ever to hit $4 trillion in market value.\n\nThe firm has, however, become entangled in trade tensions between China and the United States, which are waging a heated battle for dominance to produce the chips that power AI.\n\nIt comes as the Trump administration has been imposing stiff tariffs, with goals varying from addressing US trade imbalances, wanting to reshore manufacturing and pressuring foreign governments to change policies.\n\nA 100% tariff on many semiconductor imports came into effect this month, with exceptions for tech companies that announce major investments in the United States.",

  "summary": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that shipping Nvidia's H20 chips to China is not a security threat, but a beneficial move for both Beijing and Washington. The California-based tech giant produces some of the world's most advanced semiconductors but cannot ship its most advanced chips to the country due to concerns from Washington that Beijing could use them to enhance military capabilities. The H20, a less powerful version of its AI processing units, was developed specifically for export to China. However, this plan was thwarted when the Trump administration tightened export licensing requirements in April. Huang insisted there were no security backdoors in the H20 chip and that the company has made clear that H20 has no such devices that allow remote access. He also mentioned that Nvidia is in talks with the US government about developing a new chip for China.",
