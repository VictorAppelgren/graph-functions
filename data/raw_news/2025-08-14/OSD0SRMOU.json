  "content": "THIS IS A BALANCE OF POWER LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.. JOE: FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. STUDIO TO TV AND RADIO AUDIENCES WORLDWIDE WELCOME TO THE OF POWER. TYLER: TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT HEADS TO SCOTLAND WITH JUST ONE WEEK UNTIL THE TARIFF DEADLINE. > > I WILL BE MEETING WITH THE EU ON SUNDAY. WE WILL BE WORKING ON A DEAL. WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN MAKE A DEAL. I HIGHLY RESPECTED WOMAN. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. JOE: TRUMP LANDING IN SCOTLAND A SHORT TIME AGO SET TO MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AS THEY TRY TO LAND A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SIX DAYS UNTIL THE DEADLINE. AND A LOOK AT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS ON THE GROUND IN GAZA AS GLOBAL LEADERS CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE AFTER THE U.S. AND ISRAEL PULLED OUT OF NEGOTIATIONS ACCUSING HAMAS OF ACTING IN BAD FAITH. JOE: A PARDON FOR GHISLAINE MAXWELL? NEWS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT THINKS ABOUT A PARDON ON CROP -- OR COMMUTATION FOR THE EPSTEIN ACCOMPLISH AS THE DOJ TODAY MEETS WITH THE CONVICTED SEX TRAFFICKING FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE IMPENDING TRADE DEADLINE FOR THE PRESIDENT ARRIVED IN SCOTLAND, TELLING REPORTERS HE PLANS TO MEET WITH THE HEADS OF STATE AND BUSINESS LEADERS IN THE FIVE DAY TRIP AMONG THEM UK'S KEIR STARMER AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT ARTHUR LAVONDA LYON. -- URSULA VON DER LEYEN. HE SHARED WHAT HE THINKS IS THE ODDS OF THE U.S. AND EU STRIKING A TRADE DEAL. PRES. TRUMP: I THINK WE HAVE A 50-50 CHANCE, MAYBE LESS. A 50-50 CHANCE OF MAKING A DEAL WITH THE EU. IT WILL BE A DEAL WHERE THEY HAVE TO BRING DOWN THEIR TARIFF. RIGHT NOW IT IS OUT 30%. OR THEY CAN LEAVE THEM THE WAY THEY ARE. I WOULD HAVE SAID WE HAVE A 25% CHANCE WITH JAPAN. THEY KEPT COMING BACK AND WE MADE A DEAL. KAILEY: JOINING US TO DISCUSS IS BLOOMBERG'S WENDY BENJAMIN'S IN. WENDY, WE KNOW THE EU COMMISSION PRESENT MEANT -- PRESIDENT URSULA VON DER LEYEN WILL MEET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP THIS WEEKEND. AT THE EU HAS REVERSED ITS FAVOR. IT MOVED UP ON IT ONLINE WHEN IT COMES TO A GREAT DEAL. SHOULD WE SEE THIS AS PROGRESS? HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO AN ACTUAL FRAMEWORK? WENDY: IT'S HARD TO TELL. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING EXPECTATION SETTING. IF URSULA VON DER LEYEN, WHO HE PRESCRIBED -- DESCRIBED AS OAK WILL RESPECTED WOMAN, THAT SHE IS COMING THERE, SHE WOULD NOT BOTHER -- BOTHER COMING UNLESS SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE CLOSE. SHE SAID THERE WERE ABOUT 20 STICKING POINTS. THEY ARE GOING THROUGH SECTORAL TARIFFS, WHAT TO DO WITH STEEL, ALUMINUM, AUTO MANUFACTURING. THERE ARE STICKING POINTS TO WORK OUT BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN AT THE URSULA OF UNDERLYING AND AN TRUMP LEVEL. THEY WILL AGREE TO THE FRAMEWORK OF A DEAL THAT WILL HOLD OFF ON RECIPROCAL TARIFFS AND ALLOW MORE DETAILED TALKS TO COME FORWARD. JOE: WE ASKED TO PETER NAVARRO A COUPLE DAYS AGO AT THIS TABLE, IF THEY LAND A DEAL, THE EU, SOUTH KOREA, DO WE WALK AWAY AND SAY APRIL 1 REMAINS AT THE DEADLINE AND EVERYBODY ELSE STARTS PAYING BASED ON THE LETTER YOU RECEIVED, OR DOES THE DATE MOVE AGAIN FOR THOSE IN TALKS WITH THE WHITE HOUSE? HE WOULD NOT ANSWER. HE SAID IT SAYS -- IT IS UP TO THE BOSS. WENDY: IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, EVERYBODY IS UP TO THE BOSS. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT AT SOME POINT TODAY, SOME OF THESE DEALS ARE JUST GOING TO BE THE LETTERS I SEND OUT, INSTRUCTING YOU WHAT YOUR TARIFFS ARE FROM NOW ON. IT COULD BE, HE GETS A FEW MORE MARQUEE ONES LIKE THE EU, U.K., AND SOUTH KOREA UNDER HIS BELT. THEN, JUST SAYS THE HECK WITH THAT. I WILL SEND LETTERS OUT AND THIS IS THE WAY IT IS. THEY ALSO OPEN THE DOOR TO MORE NEGOTIATIONS. I THINK IF A LEADER CAME BACK AND SAID, I GOT YOUR LETTER BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT ALUMINUM, HE MIGHT PUSH THINGS BACK. THESE DEADLINES ARE VERY FLUID. TYLER: STICKING TO TRADE WHAT SORT OF DEALS ARE WE WAITING FOR? WE KNOW THE EU AND SOUTH KOREA. WHAT ARE OTHER TRADING PARTNERS WE GET TO HEAR FROM THAT WERE PERHAPS NOT PRIORITIZED LEADING TO THIS? WENDY: AT THE MOMENT, CANADA. THEY EVEN SAID TODAY OR YESTERDAY, THE LAST 48 HOURS OR SO, SOMEBODY SAID, WE AREN'T IN CANADA. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL. IT WON'T WORK. THAT ALSO MIGHT BE A NEGOTIATING POSITION. REMEMBER, HE HAS SET TARIFFS ON EVERY PART OF THE PLANET. THE ISLANDS WITH PENGUINS ON THEM HAVE TARIFFS TOO. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE DEALS TO BE MADE. THE FILIPINO PRESIDENT WAS JUST IN. THEY ARE STILL WORKING ON THAT DEAL. THERE IS THIS WHOLE PLAN TO GO THROUGH. JOE: THE PRESIDENT IS HEADING ABROAD WITH THE TRAIT STORY UNFOLDING. THE ISSUE IS STILL DOGGING THE PRESIDENT AFTER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TODD BLANCHE MET WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCOMPLISH JOLENE MAXWELL FOR A SECONDARY AND THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT IT ON HIS WAY OUT THIS MORNING AS WE GET NEW POLLING ON THE ISSUE. A NEW REUTERS POLL SHOWS ONLY 17% OF THE PUBLIC APPROVES OF THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THIS ISSUE. > > NOW, THE PRESIDENT LANDS IN SCOTLAND AND IT SEEMS THE ISSUE COULD BE FOLLOWING HIM. IMAGES OF THE PRESIDENT WITH EPSTEIN HAVE BEEN POSTED ACROSS THE U.K. THIS MORNING. AS OF THE PRESENT ARE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE HE HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT AN ALLEGED BIRTHDAY CARD HE SENT TO EPSTEIN. PRES. TRUMP: I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. SOMEBODY COULD HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER AND USED MY NAME. THAT HAS HAPPENED A LOT. YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DOSSIER. THE FAKE DOSSIER. EVERYTHING IS FAKE. EVERYTHING IS FAKE WITH THE DEMOCRATS. TYLER: WE MENTIONED POLLING WITH THE EPSTEIN ISSUE. WE HAVE FULLY TODAY FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT 88% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS ACTUALLY APPROVE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE. HE SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL WHEN IT COMES TO THE BASE. HOW COULD THIS ISSUE TO FIGHT HIS FACE? WENDY: THE POLLING IS SHOWING IT IS PULLING AWAY. THERE IS THE BEGINNING OF A FRACTURING IN AN INCREDIBLY SOLID BASE THAT HE HAS ENJOYED THROUGH BOTH TERMS THUS FAR. AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A CRACK IN THAT. THERE WAS ANOTHER POLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT SHOWED 36% OF REPUBLICANS DISAPPROVE OF THE WAY HE IS HANDLING THE EPSTEIN STORY. THAT'S REMARKABLY HIGH FOR HIS OWN PARTY FOR THIS PRESIDENT. OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN PARTY. I WOULD THINK, JILL BIDEN INCLUDED THROUGH THEIR OWN PARTY IS UPSET WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE. FOR TERM, THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED. FOR ONE THIRD OF REPUBLICANS TO BE UPSET WITH THE WAY HE IS HANDLING THIS IS REMARKABLE. HE WAS ASKED ABOUT GHISLAINE MAXWELL AND THE PARDON. HE SAID, I HAVE THE POWER TO DO IT BUT I HAVE NOT DECIDED WHETHER TO DO IT. I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WILL PLAY WITH HIS FACE. IF HE PARDONS HER, IT WILL -- IT DEPENDS. HE MADE IT CLEAR IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SHE SAYS TO TODD BLANCHE, WHO INTERVIEWED HER SEVERAL TIMES TODAY. THIS STORY ISN'T GOING AWAY, UNFORTUNATELY. THE IMAGES OF HIM ON BUS STOPS AT SCOTLAND WILL BE IRKING HIM, I'M SURE. > > HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME POINTING TO BILL CLINTON. > > BILL CLINTON TODAY SAID, RELEASE THE FILES. I DON'T CARE. > > THIS COULD GET MORE INTERESTING. NOW JOINING US FOR MORE ON HOW REPUBLICANS ARE SURROUNDING THE RELEASE OF THE EPSTEIN FILES AND WHAT AWAITS LAWMAKERS ON AUGUST RECESS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES IS MARK SHORT, THE FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FROM VICE PRESIDENT MARK -- MIKE PENCE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL DISTRACTION. WE WON'T SOLVE THE ISSUE OF THE EPSTEIN FILES TONIGHT. LAWMAKERS IN THE HOUSE ENDED UP GOING HOME EARLY BECAUSE OF THIS. A VERY CLOSE, SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THEY RETURNED IT TO GET A BUDGET DONE. IT WILL BE LOOMING OVER THE HILL WHEN THEY RETURN. HOW MUCH DOES IT AFFECT BUSINESS? MARK: IT WILL AFFECT ITS SIGNIFICANT LEAK. PROBABLY THERE IS A SENSE AMONG SOME IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT IT FELT LIKE WE AVOIDED HAVING A VOTE ON THIS PRIOR TO THE AUGUST RECESS. SO THIS WILL BUY US SOME TIME. IT MIGHT BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT GOES AWAY. I THINK DISTRICTS WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS. THIS HAS BEEN A WHITE-HOT ISSUE FOR REPUBLICANS AND MANY OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE INFLUENCERS ON THE RIGHT WERE DRUMMING UP THE STORY THAT DEMOCRATS WERE CAUGHT IN THIS SCANDAL AND EXPECTED IT TO COME OUT. I THINK YOU WILL SEE MORE REPUBLICANS SIGN ONTO THE DISCHARGE PETITION FORCING THE HAND OF THE SPEAKER TO VOTE ON THIS. TYLER: DO YOU THINK IT RISKS THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS? THAT IT WILL TAKE SO MUCH ROOM UP WHEN LAWMAKERS COME BACK THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A SHOW DOWN THE FALL? MARC: I AM CYNICAL ABOUT THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS IN GENERAL. WE HAVEN'T HAD CONGRESS COMPLETE APPROPRIATIONS BILLS ON TIME SINCE BILL CLINTON. I IMAGINE YOU WILL HAVE A CONTINUING RESOLUTION. I DON'T KNOW HOW HIGH THE RISK IS FOR A SHUTDOWN. THE EARLY NUMBERS ARE PRETTY CLOSE. I THINK YOU WILL SEE THEM AVOID A SHUTDOWN FOR NOW. > > NO SHUTDOWN. GOOD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT THERE ARE OTHER MATTERS AT HAND. WE HAVE TALKED A LOT RECENTLY ABOUT RESCISSIONS. WE WERE PROMISED ANOTHER IF THE LAST ONE PASSED. NOT TO MENTION THE POTENTIAL FOR ANOTHER RECONCILIATION BILL. NOT TO GET TOO OVERBOARD, WOULD THERE BE ANOTHER RESCISSIONS PACKAGE? IT IS WHAT SENT DEMOCRATS TO THE HILL, SAYING, WE WILL SHUT IT DOWN. MARC: THERE COULD BE ANOTHER RESCISSIONS PACKAGE AT SOME POINT IN THE FALL, I IMAGINE, AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 30 VOTE FOR A CONTINUING RESOLUTION. I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING AT A FIGHT WITH CONGRESS ON THE IMPOUNDMENT AT AND I THINK THEY WILL DEBATE A RESCISSIONS PACKAGE THAT ACTUALLY FAILS. THEN THEY CAN SEE, -- SAY, CONGRESS IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. WE CAN IMPOUND THE FUNDS AND SET UP A LEGAL BATTLE LATER IN THE YEAR. TYLER: SOME REPUBLICANS SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER RESCISSIONS PACKAGE. I LOVE YOUR TAKE THAT CONGRESS IS GIVING UP ITS POWER OF THE PURSE INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON ANOTHER PRIORITY TO GET DONE. MARC: I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT RESTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN -- GIVING UP LATELY BUT I THINK THE RESCISSIONS PACKAGE THAT PASSED WAS THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL THAT THEY COULD DO. I THINK THE FACT IF YOU HAVE A SECOND ONE, THE CHANCES OF IT PASSING ARE MUCH LESS. JOE: I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE IDEA OF REBATE CHECKS. THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT IT THIS MORNING AND JOSH HAWLEY FOLLOWED UP WITH LEGISLATION. LET'S HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE TO SCOTLAND. PRES. TRUMP: WE HAVE SO MUCH MONEY COMING IN. WE ARE THINKING ABOUT A LITTLE REBATE BUT THE MAIN THING WE WANT TO DO IS PAY DOWN DEBT. WE ARE THINKING ABOUT A REBATE BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH MONEY COMING IN. FROM THE TARIFFS. A LITTLE REBATE FOR PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN INCOME LEVEL MIGHT BE VERY NICE. JOE: A LITTLE REBATE AND JUST LIKE THAT SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY'S OFFICE PUTS OUT A TWEET TO SEND A REBATE CHECK TO EVERY WORKING AMERICAN. YOU SEE THAT ON BLOOMBERG, TV, AND YOUTUBE. HE WILL INTRODUCE THIS LEGISLATION. EVERY WORKING PERSON IN AMERICA. ISN'T THIS WHAT REPUBLICANS CRITICIZED JOE BIDEN FOR FOR TWO YEARS? MARC: I HAVE NEVER SEEN A REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION WITH SO MANY CENTRAL PLANNERS IN THEIR ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT. IT IS BASICALLY THE POLICY OF THE DEMOCRATS. IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE REPUBLICANS ADVANCE BY THE -- LEGISLATION TO RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE AND EMBRACE MORE REGULATIONS. THIS REFLECTS A DRAMATIC SHIFT. I THINK RATHER THAN SAYING REBATE CHECKS IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE MONEY ROLLING INTO THE TREASURY AS A TAX ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT IS NOT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT PAYING THE TARIFF, IT'S AMERICAN CITIZENS. SO INSTEAD OF GIVING A REBATE CHECK, ONE THING THEY COULD DO IS LOWER THE TARIFFS TO PROVIDE HELP FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. TYLER: LET'S THREAD THE NEEDLE BETWEEN A RECONCILIATION TO POINT OUT PACKAGE AND THE IDEA TARIFF REVENUE IS SUPPOSED TO HELP PAY DOWN WHAT WE SAW ADDED WHEN IT COMES TO DEFICIT SPENDING FROM THE FIRST RECONCILIATION PACKAGE. CAN YOU CONNECT THE DOTS? RECONCILIATION TO POINT OUT, HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON TOLD US THIS WEEK THEY ARE ALREADY STARTING TO WORK ON IT. WOULD IT BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADDING TO THE DEFICIT IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF PRIORITIES THAT MIGHT END UP GETTING WRAPPED INTO IT? MARC: I THINK THE TALK OF RESIDENT -- RECONCILIATION TWO POINT KNOW IS HAPPY TALK. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL SEE THAT. THE FIRST BILL HAD ALL THE MAJOR PRIORITIES OF CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THEY ARE ALMOST SEARCHING FOR WHAT TO PUT IN IT. I THINK THIS WILL GIVE THE PROSPECT OF HOPE FOR THE VOTERS TO SAY, WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL SEE ONE. JOE: I WANT TO QUICKLY ASK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO THE FED YESTERDAY. AS SOMEBODY WAS A BIT MORE FINANCIALLY MINDED THAT SOME IN WASHINGTON. -- EXAMINE SOME IN WASHINGTON READ THIS WILL RESULT IN VERY LITTLE. HE WON'T GET FIRED. HE WON'T STEP DOWN. AND NOBODY EXPECTS THE FED TO CUT INTEREST RATES NEXT WEEK. WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP DOING? MARC: I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. I THINK FOR THE PRESIDENT, HE VIEWS THIS AS A NO LOSE SITUATION. EITHER A, POWELL CONCEDES AND LOWERS RATES, WHAT TRUMP WANTS. B, POWELL GETS TIRED AND QUITS, AND TRUMP WOULD BE OK WITH THAT TOO. C, IF THE TARIFF POLICY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR HE HAS SOMEONE TO BLAME. IT IS A SIGNAL HE SETS UP FOR WHOEVER SUCCEEDS POWELL. HE HAS A CLEAR MESSAGE. I WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE HELL OR YOU WILL LOWER RATES. FOR HIM I THINK IT IS A NO LOSE SITUATION. JOE: GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. THE FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO VICE PRESIDENT MARK PENCE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST LIVE WITH US IN WASHINGTON ON BLOOMBERG. A FEW MOMENTS AGO A FEDERAL JUDGE IN BOSTON ISSUED THE SECOND NATIONWIDE BLOCK OF THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDERS THIS MONTH. LAWSUITS CONTINUE. A RECENT SUPREME COURT DECISION RESTRICTING INJUNCTIONS IS HAVING LIMITED IMPACT ON THIS ISSUE. WE WILL BRING YOU ANY REACTION WE HAVE AHEAD FROM THE PRESIDENT. TYLER: COMING UP, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT OR SET OF UNDER LIEN WILL TRAVEL TO SCOTLAND TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AS THE EU TRIES TO CLINCH A TRADE DEAL. FIRST, THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA AS THE U.S. AND ISRAEL WITHDRAW NEGOTIATING TEAMS FROM QATAR WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYING HAMAS IS NOT ACTING IN GOOD FAITH. WE DISCUSS WHAT IS NEXT FOR GAZA WITH KIERAN DONNELLY HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM AT THE IRC NEXT ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. U HAMAS --PRES. TRUMP: HAMAS DID NOT REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. I THINK THEY WANT TO DIE. IT'S VERY BAD. THEY PULLED OUT. THEY WILL HAVE TO FIGHT. THEY WILL HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP. JOE: PRESIDENT FROM COMMENTING THIS MORNING ON CEASE-FIRE TALKS WITH HAMAS THAT WERE CUT SHORT AFTER THE U.S. AND ISRAEL WITHDREW THEIR NEGOTIATING TEAMS FROM QATAR. THEY HAVE LEFT THE TABLE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. I'M JOE MATTHEW ALONGSIDE TYLER KENDALL IN WASHINGTON. SPECIAL ENVOY STEVE WITKOFF TOLD REPORTERS HAMAS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE COORDINATED OR ACTING IN GOOD FAITH AS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS UNFOLDS IN GAZA. ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU IS CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE GLOBAL BLOWBACK OVER WHAT NGOS ARE DEEMING A MASS STARVATION OCCURRING RIGHT NOW IN GAZA. EMMANUEL MACRON IS MOVING TO RECOGNIZE A PALESTINIAN STATE OFFICIALLY, A STEP UNLIKELY TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE WAR, BUT ONE THAT RAISES POTENTIAL PRESSURE ON OTHER WORLD LEADERS TO ACT. IT JOINING US WITH THAT AND MORE IS BLOOMBERG'S MAGDALENA DELPHI LIVE FROM WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. GREAT TO HAVE YOU. THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN ASKED ABOUT EMMANUEL MACRON TODAY, HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. WHAT HE SAYS DOES NOT MATTER. WHAT DOES THE MOVE MEAN FOR THE POLITICS OF THE WAR? MAGDALENA: OF COURSE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THERE WILL BE ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THE GROUND. WE WON'T BE SEEING A CEASE-FIRE TOMORROW BECAUSE HE ANNOUNCED FRANCE WILL BE ACKNOWLEDGING PALESTINE AS A SOVEREIGN STATE. HOWEVER IT IS STILL A POWERFUL SYMBOL AT A CRITICAL TIME. FIRST, BECAUSE IT IS BRINGING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION BACK TO GAZA. IN RECENT WEEKS HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SAYING THE SITUATION THERE IS WORSE THAN EVER. PEOPLE ARE STARVING. CHILDREN ARE EXTREMELY MALNOURISHED AND CIVILIANS ARE BEING SHOT ON THEIR WAY TO GET FOOD. PRESIDENT MACRON IS BRINGING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO THE CRISIS. THE SECOND THING IS HE IS ESTABLISHING A TONE FOR A CONFERENCE TAKING PLACE AT THE UNITED NATIONS NEXT WEEK BEING COHOSTED BY FRANCE AND SAUDI ARABIA. THEIR DIPLOMATS ARE SET TO DISCUSS A TWO STATE SOLUTION AND THE NEXT STEPS FOR GAZA AFTER A CEASE-FIRE IS REACHED. SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED PALESTINE SHOULD BE A SOVEREIGN STATE. NOW THAT FRANCE, THE OTHER COHOST, HAVE DONE THE SAME, THE AGENDA IS SET FOR HOW CONVERSATIONS ARE SET TO GO AT THE CONFERENCE. THE THIRD THING THIS DOES IS OPENS THE DOOR FOR OTHER -- OTHERS TO FOLLOW SUIT INCLUDING KEIR STARMER, WHO IS PART OF IT HAS BEEN PUSHING TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINE AS A STATE FOR A WHILE. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE KEIR STARMER IS SET TO MEET WITH DONALD TRUMP NEXT WEEK AND DONALD TRUMP HAS BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S EAR. THERE ARE POSSIBLE RIPPLE EFFECTS THAT COULD COME FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY. TYLER: ALL RIGHT. MAGDALENA, THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING. NOW, SOME NEWS OUTLETS INCLUDING THE BBC AND AFP ARE WARNING THEIR JOURNALISTS IN GAZA ARE AT RISK OF STARVATION CALLING ON ISRAEL TO TAKE ACTION BEYOND THE APPROVAL OF AIR DROPPING AID INTO THE CONFLICT ZONE. HEADLINES PILE UP ABOUT DIRE CONDITIONS. ONE REPORT FROM THE GUARDIAN READING \"SKELETAL CHILDREN FILL HOSPITAL WARDS AS STARVATION GRIPS \" ISRAEL BLAMED THE SITUATION ON HAMAS SAYING THE MILITANT GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FOOD DISTRIBUTION SHORTFALLS. WE TURN TO KIERAN DONNELLY HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS AT THE IRC OR INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING BLOOMBERG. CAN YOU GIVE US CONTEXT SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS? HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THIS CONFLICT ZONE ARE CURRENTLY AT RISK WHEN IT COMES TO STARVATION? KIERAN: THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON, TYLER. IN GAZA THERE ARE 2.1 MILLION PEOPLE. THE ENTIRE POPULATION IS CLASSIFIED IN WHAT WE CALL ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY. IT MEANS EVERYBODY IN GAZA STRUGGLES TO FIND FOOD TO FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY ON A DAILY BASIS. OF THE 2.1, ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF FOOD INSECURITY AND .5 MILLION ARE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCALE, FAMINE CONDITIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE A LAGGING INDICATOR. THEY INDICATE THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND AT THE TIME THE DATA WAS COLLECTED AND THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY. TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON IT AND CONTEXT TO IT, THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE SHOWN, THE APOCALYPTIC SCENARIO ON THE GROUND, IT HAS TRANSLATED TO CHILDREN, ELDERLY PEOPLE, AND EVEN HEALTHY ADULTS THAT JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND ARE SUCCUMBING TO ACUTE MALNUTRITION AND STARVATION. THIS WILL ONLY CONTINUE WITHOUT RAPID AND SCALED UP HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION ON A LEVEL WE HAVE NOT SEEN YET IN THE WAR. JOE: WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS INCLUDING JOE BIDEN'S EFFORTS TO GO AROUND THE ISRAELIS. OUR OWN ALLIES, BY BUILDING A PEER. THAT DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE EXPERIMENT. HOW SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND THIS? IS IT ISRAEL OR HAMAS THAT IS MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR BLOCKING FOOD TO GAZA? KIERAN: LOOK, I CAN SAY THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DELIVER AID AT THE VOLUMES NEEDED TO GET TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT MOST NEED IT WHERE THEY CURRENTLY ARE AND TO DELIVER NOT JUST FOOD, BUT SPECIALIZED SERVICES AND MALNUTRITION TREATMENT, MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND SO ON, AND TO DO ALL THAT IN A WAY THAT FOLLOWS THE MOST RIGOROUS PROCESSES FOR ENSURING THAT NO PARTY IN THE CONFLICT BENEFITS, ALL THAT EXISTS TODAY IN THE UNITED NATIONS AND HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE IRC. THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALLOWING US THE ACCESS AND SPACE TO SCALE UP. WE HAVE SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THE AID WE DELIVER AND MANAGE DOES NOT BENEFIT HAMAS OR ANY OTHER PARTY IN CONFLICT ZONES AROUND THE WORLD. WE SEE THINGS LIKE PEERS, DISCUSSIONS OF A DROP IN THE HEADLINES. THESE THINGS ARE REALLY DISTRACTIONS. THEY WILL NEVER ALLOW US TO REACH THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE REACHED WITH THE LEVELS OF AID AND TYPES OF SERVICES THEY NEED. WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS ACCESS ON THE GROUND, NOT EARDROPS. -- AIR DROPS. TYLER: WHAT IS WHAT ACTION THAT COULD BE PRIORITIZED TO HELP YOU GET AID TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT THE MOST? KIERAN: WE HAVE TONS OF SUPPLIES SITTING ON THE GAZA BORDER. AS DOES EVERY OTHER HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION IN GAZA. OPEN THE BORDERS. ALLOW OUR SUPPLIES ARE IN. CREATE SAFE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS SERVICES. OPEN THE GATES. THAT IS WHAT IS NEEDED TO SAVE LIVES IN GAZA. THERE IS A TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE LOOMING IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. JOE: GREAT TO HAVE YOU AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHTS, KIERAN DONNELLY, HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS AT THE IRC, THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF BALANCE OF POWER THIS EVENING. COMING UP, WE TURN TO EUROPE. URSULA VON DER LEYEN WILL MEET PRESIDENT TRUMP THIS WEEKEND IN A BID TO CLINCH A TRADE DEAL AHEAD OF THE AUGUST 1 DEADLINE ONE WEEK FROM TODAY. PRESIDENT TRUMP HEADS TO SCOTLAND FOR THE WEEKEND. HE HAS TRADE ON THE AGENDA, NOT ONLY WITH THE EU, BUT THE U.K.. WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS NEXT ON A BALANCE OF POWER. LIVE FROM WASHINGTON ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. PRES. TRUMP: AUGUST 1 WILL COME. WE HAVE NOT REALLY HAD A LOT OF LUCK WITH CANADA. I THINK CANADA COULD BE ONE WARRIOR -- WHERE THEY WILL JUST PAY TARIFFS. WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH EUROPE AND THE EU. THERE ARE A LOT OF TARIFFS AND A LOT OF COUNTRIES. THAT'S THE BIG ONE NOW. JOE: THE BIG ONE, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS, HEAD OF BOARDING'S FIGHT TO SCOTLAND FOR THE WEEKEND SAYING WHILE THE AUGUST 1 DEADLINE IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING, ONE WEEK OUT, HE BELIEVES MANY TRADE DEALS WILL BE FINISHED IN TIME. JOINING US FOR MORE IS HEIDI WHITAKER, A SENIOR FELLOW IN THE CENTER FOR GEO-ECONOMIC STUDIES AND THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, THE FIRST CHIEF ECONOMIST IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION STATE DEPARTMENT. ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN WASHINGTON. IS THERE A STRATEGY HERE FOR THE EU, THE PRESIDENT, AND HIS ADVISERS FROM PETER NAVARRO TO HOWARD LUTNICK AND SCOTT BESSENT? WE ARE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF JAPAN AND THE DEALS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY UNLOCK. THE EU WOULD BE THE BIG ONE, AS THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED. COULD THAT HAPPEN IN THE NEXT WEEK? HEIDI: IT COULD, BUT I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH. AS WE GO TOWARDS THE DEADLINE A LOT OF COUNTRIES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE CAPITULATING OR READY TO WRITE CHECKS AND I THINK THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. THERE IS A SENSE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO TAKE THE TEMPERATURE DOWN AND HAVE LESS CHAOS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE JAPAN DEALER I THINK THAT EVEN THE JAPAN -- THE JAPANESE ARE NOT CLEAR WHAT THEY AGREED TO. THEY CAME OUT TODAY SAYING, UNLIKE WHAT PRESIDENT SAID, IT'S NOT A $550 BILLION CHECK THAT THEY CAN JUST DO THAT KIND OF SPLIT WITH THE JAPANESE. IT'S MORE OF A FRAMEWORK WHERE THERE IS NO DEAL SIGNED. JOE: THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED IT A BLANK CHECK. HEIDI: HOWARD LUTNICK SAID IT COULD BE FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, FABS, A LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK THE JAPANESE ARE TAKING A STEP BACK AND GOING, WE DID NOT AGREE TO THOSE TERMS. THIS WILL BE DECIDED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES. THERE IS AN ENVELOPE FOR LOANS AND LOAN GUARANTEES, POTENTIAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THOSE WILL BE TAKEN BY COMPANY DECISIONS WITH THE BACKING OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THEY ALSO ASSUME THAT THE U.S. WOULD BE CONTRIBUTING AS WELL. THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS AND A TRADE IS VERY COMPLICATED. TITLE: ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION ESSENTIALLY SAYING THIS INNOVATIVE FUND, IN THEIR WORDS, ULTIMATELY GOT THE JAPAN DEAL OVER THE FINISH LINE. TO COME BACK TO THE EUROPEAN UNION, WE KNOW THESE ARE 27 DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES NEGOTIATING. HOW ARE WE SEEING THAT COMPLICATE THINGS AS WE TRY TO GET TOWARDS THE FINISH LINE AND WE KNOW THE EU COMMISSION PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO GET THIS DONE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER THE WEEKEND. HEIDI: SHE WILL BE GOING TO SCOTLAND SUNDAY AND NEGOTIATING WHAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE A FINAL DEAL. THE EU HAS COME TOGETHER AND AGREED THAT THEY WOULD BE READY TO RETALIATE ON AUGUST 7. IF, ON AUGUST 1, THE PRESIDENT MOVES AHEAD WITH FULL TARIFFS WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANY NEGOTIATIONS. I THINK THEY WOULD BE READY TO COME DOWN TO THE 15%. I THINK THE LANDING ZONE OF 15% IS WHAT A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE ASSUMING THEY WILL GET TO. AGAIN, TRUMP CAME OUT AND SAID THEY NEED TO BUY THEIR TARIFFS DOWN. I THINK THAT MEANS THE SAME THING THE JAPANESE DID IN WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- LIKE WHAT THEY INTERPRETED, TO WRITE A BIG FAT CHECK. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE EUROPEANS DO THAT. 27 MEMBER STATES AND THEY ALL HAVE TO AGREE TO WHATEVER THE TERMS ARE AGREED TO BY URSULA VON DER LEYEN. JOE: LIKE PAYING DOWN A MORTGAGE APPARENTLY IS HOW TRADE DEALS WORK IN THIS WHITE HOUSE. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS VISION OF SELLING GM CARS AND FORDS AND CHRYSLER'S IN PLACES LIKE EUROPE AND JAPAN. IS THIS A FALSE PROMISE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT COULD COME FROM OPENING THE MARKETS? HEIDI: I DO THINK THAT THE AUTO ISSUE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, TO EUROPE, AND FOR JAPAN AS WELL, THEY WANT TO HAVE THE U.S. MARKET OPEN TO THEIR AUTOS. IF WE ARE MANUFACTURING VERY LARGE SUV TYPE VEHICLES, THEN, THEY ARE NOT AS EASILY MARKETABLE. IN EUROPE, AND CERTAINLY NOT JAPAN. IT COMES DOWN TO CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR CERTAIN MARKETS. IT IS REALLY RATHER THE -- WHETHER THE PRICE POINT HITS THE RIGHT MARKET FOR EUROPE OR JAPAN. IT'S REALLY A CONSUMER DECISION. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, IN EUROPE, IN PARTICULAR, THEY HAVE A HUGE, HUGE ONSLAUGHT OF MARKETS. THEIR OWN AUTOMAKERS ARE STRUGGLING NOW TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN COMPETE. TYLER: WE HAVE SEEN A SECTOR SPECIFIC TARIFFS COME INTO THE CONVERSATION IN SUCH A SPECIFIC AND SIGNIFICANT WAY. WHY? IS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THERE IS THE POTENCY FOR THE U.S. ON THAT SIDE, THAT ALL OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS REALLY DO WANT TO SEE CARVEOUTS FOR KEY INDUSTRIES? HEIDI: IDEALLY I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE CARVEOUTS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF COUNTRIES JUST COME DOWN TO WHATEVER THE LOWEST IS. EUROPE WILL PUSH ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM, ON AUTOS, AND ON PHARMA. THOSE ARE THREE KEY AREAS FOR THE EU. FOR JAPAN IT WAS THE RICE IMPORTS. IT'S A DEEPLY DIVISIVE POLITICAL ISSUE IN JAPAN. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHILE WE IN THEORY OPEN TO THE MARKET FOR U.S. EQUITIES, STILL, IT WILL BE DIVISIVE. YOU DO HAVE CERTAIN AREAS WHERE YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE FRICTION. BUT AGAIN, THESE ARE ALL VERY COMPLICATED DEALS TO NEGOTIATE. IF YOU HAVE TWO PARTIES WALKING AWAY THINKING YOU HAVE A DEAL AND THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO DETAILS, IT'S PROBLEMATIC. IT MEANS THE TARIFF WAR ISN'T GOING AWAY IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. AUGUST 1 COMES, THEN WE SEE, ACTUALLY, WHAT WE HAVE. JOE: WHAT IS MORE LIKELY? THE TRADE WAR WITH EUROPE OR A DEAL? HEIDI: IT WILL BE HARD TO NOT COME TO A DEAL EVENTUALLY WITH EUROPE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER FOR THE U.S.. I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT CANADA. THEY ARE NOT ONLY OUR DEAR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH, BUT ONE OF OUR CLOSEST TRADING PARTNERS. THEIR ECONOMY IS COMPLETELY TIED TO EXPORTING TO THE U.S.. RIGHT NOW IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ON THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AT ALL. HE IS SAYING CANADA IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST THAT I THINK THAT'S WORRYING. TYLER: HEIDI CREBO REDIKER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NOW, A LOOK AT THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC IMPACT TO THE IMPENDING TRADE DEADLINE ON AUGUST 1. MEGAN SHELLENBERGER, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT KPMG. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE SEEING THE BASELINE TARIFF RATE SHAKEOUT. OUR UNDERSTANDING, THE INVESTOR'S UNDERSTANDING HAD BEEN IT WOULD BE AT 10%. THAT THAT WOULD BE THE FLOOR. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THINGS SWITCH UP. NATIONS ARE HOVERING CLOSE TO A 15% TARIFF RATE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU SEE THIS HEADED WHEN IT COMES TO A GLOBAL BRAND -- BLANKET TARIFF? MEAGAN WE ARE SEEING WITH THE AUGUST 1 DEADLINE, SOME OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS, TARIFFS WILL STILL INCREASE. LOOK AT THE EU TRADE DEAL. IN THE BEST EXAMPLE TARIFFS INCREASE 10%-15%. THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE A LOT OF REVENUES COMING IN FROM TARIFFS AND CLIMBING DURING THE MONTH. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING AT THAT AND THINKING ABOUT CAPTURING SOME OF THOSE REVENUES TO PAY FOR SOME INCREASES IN THE DEFICIT IN THE BILL. IT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT IF A LOT OF THESE DO GET NEGOTIATED DOWN, MAYBE WE EVEN GET A HIGHER BASELINE TARIFF. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN FLOATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION GOING FROM 10%-15 PERCENT. REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS, THE EFFECTIVE TARIFF RATE ON U.S. IMPORTS WILL CLIMB. THE TAX BURDEN ON BOTH CORPORATE AND HOUSEHOLDS IS LIKELY TO INCREASE. JOE: AN INTERESTING IDEA IS WHERE THE MONEY GOES. NOW, THE PRESIDENT IS SUGGESTING REBATE CHECKS, POTENTIALLY. WE COULD HAVE A WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHERE THAT MONEY WOULD BE MOST USEFUL. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE TARIFF -- TARIFFS START TO GO AWAY? THE MORE DETAILS WE HAVE, POTENTIALLY, THE FEWER TARIFFS WE HAVE BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. TO WHAT EXTENT COULD THIS DATE A WEEK FROM TODAY MOVE? MEAGAN: THE UP AND DOWN IS A BIG SOURCE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ECONOMY IS EXPERIENCING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. ONE THING I TALK ABOUT WITH CLIENTS IS EVEN IF THE TARIFFS GO AWAY TOMORROW, IT IS STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE IT'S UP THERE IS NOT A LOT OF FAITH IN THE DIRECTION OF TARIFFS. I THINK THAT REGARDLESS OF NEGOTIATIONS WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT A HIGHER FEDERAL TARIFF RATE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. ALSO BECAUSE THERE ARE NINE SECTION TWO 32 INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY THAT ARE SECTOR SPECIFIC TARIFFS ON EVERYTHING FROM TRUCKS TO RARE EARTHS. SEMICONDUCTORS. PRODUCTS THAT GO INTO SOLAR CELLS. AND OF COURSE, COPPER AND LUMBER, THE FIRST TWO. WE HAVE A LOT OF THOSE IN OUR FORECAST. OUR OWN FORECAST IS THE EFFECTIVE TARIFF RATE CLIMBED FROM WHERE IT IS TODAY, 9%-10%, TO POTENTIALLY DOUBLE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. TYLER: I WONDER WHERE YOU ARE TELLING CLIENTS WHO ARE ASKING ABOUT POTENTIAL INFLATIONARY IMPACTS OF TARIFF. -- TARIFFS. WHAT TIMELINES ARE YOU FORECASTING WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING THE NUMBERS? PARTICULARLY AS WE SEE TARIFFS RATES SHIFTING ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS? MEAGAN: THERE IS A LAG OF 16-18 MONTHS. EVEN IF WE ASSUME IT'S A LOT FASTER THIS TIME AROUND DUE TO ENFORCEMENT, WE ARE STILL AT THE EARLY END OF THE TIMELINE FOR SOME OF THE FIRST TARIFFS THAT WERE SIGNED INTO LAW. I DON'T THINK THE INFLATIONARY IMPACTS HAVE BEEN FULLY FAILED. ALSO, THE IMPACTS ON DEMAND AND A SLOWDOWN IN CONSUMPTION, POTENTIALLY, MARGIN COMPRESSION, AND POTENTIAL LAYOFFS. THAT IS THE CORE OF THE DEBATE, I THINK I'M AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE RIGHT NOW. WHICH ONE WINS OUT? DEMAND VIA A MARGIN COMPRESSION OR LAYOFFS OR INFLATION? TIMING WISE, WE THINK INFLATION MIGHT HIT FIRST, OVER THE FALL AND WINTER, POTENTIALLY. THAT'S WHY WE THINK THE FED WILL HOLD OFF FOR SOME TIME. THOUGH, IT WILL BE HOTLY DEBATED, I THINK, OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD CUT RATES. JOE: THANK YOU FOR HAVE THINK -- THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. THE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT A BALANCE OF POWER. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE HAS CONSIDERED -- HAS NOT CONSIDERED PARDONING CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER GHISLAINE MAXWELL BUT COULD IF YOU WANTED TO. WE DISCUSS HOW PRESIDENTIAL POWER COULD IMPACT THE RELEASE OF THE EPSTEIN FILES NEXT WHEN WE ASSEMBLE OUR POLITICAL PANEL ON BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. JOE: THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. ALONGSIDE TYLER KENDALL, I'M JOE MATHIEU, THE STORIES WE ARE FOLLOWING IN TODAY'S POWER BREEZE. CORNELL UNIVERSITY MIGHT BE THE NEXT SCHOOL TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO REINSTATE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RESEARCH FUNDING THAT WAS PULLED BECAUSE OF ALLEGATIONS OF ANTI-SEMITISM. THE DEAL IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE A CASH FINE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AS WELL AS A WIDE SET OF POLICY REFORMS. WEDNESDAY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY BECAME THE FIRST SCHOOL TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT. A WHITE HOUSE SOURCE TOLD BLOOMBERG BROWN UNIVERSITY AND NORTHEASTERN -- NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, I SHOULD SAY, ARE CLOSE TO STRIKING SIMILAR DEALS. TYLER: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS DEPORTING DETAINEES FROM THE MAKESHIFT ASCENSION -- DETENTION CENTER IN FLORIDA DUBBED ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ. FLORIDA'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IS ABOUT 100 PEOPLE WERE DEPORTED DIRECTLY FROM THE FACILITY BUT DECLINED TO SAY WHERE THEY WERE BEING SENT. THE FACILITY WAS QUICKLY SET UP IN LATE JUNE AND WAS TOURED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP BEFORE OPENING THIS MONTH. LAST WEEK A GROUP OF DETAINEES SUED FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES CLAIMING THE CENTER HAS NO PROCEDURES FOR MIGRANTS TO CONTACT THEIR LAWYERS. JOE: PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVED IN SCOTLAND FOR A FIVE-DAY VISIT FOR WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLING A WORKING TRIP FOR TRADE TALKS WITH LEADERS FROM THE EU AND U.K.. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE STAYING AT A GOLF RESORT ON SCOTLAND'S NORTHEAST COAST FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE TRIP. FOR LISTENERS ON BLOOMBERG RADIO, WE ARE LOOKING AT IMAGES OF SECURITY RAMPING UP AROUND THE PROPERTY AHEAD OF HIS ARRIVAL ON LAND AND SEA. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL VISIT HIS FAMILY'S NEWEST GOLF COURSE NEAR THE CITY OF ABERDEEN, AHEAD OF ITS OFFICIAL OPENING NEXT MONTH. AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE COMPANY -- COUNTRY ARE PREPARING FOR PROTESTS. TYLER: JOINING US WITH THEIR REACTION IS THIS YEAR'S POLITICAL PANEL, RICK DAVIS, STONEBRIDGE CAPITAL PARTNER AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST ALONGSIDE DEMOCRATIC ANALYST GINNY SHEEHAN AND MEL AMOUNT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR -- JEANNIE SHEEHAN KAILEY:AINO A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR FROM IONA YAMMER OF THE CITY. THERE ARE PRETTY HIGH STATES BUT THE EU COULD FACE A 30% TARIFF IF THEY DON'T MAKE A DEAL WITH THE U.S.. WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT? COULD PRESIDENT RUMPLE THE TRIGGER ON A RATE THAT HIGH? EARLIER TODAY HE SAID THERE WAS A 50-50 CHANCE THEY GET AN AGREEMENT. RICK: IF THEY DON'T GET AN AGREEMENT HE WILL PULL THE TRIGGER ON A RATE THAT HIGH BECAUSE THAT IS HOW HE HAS DEMONSTRATED HIS NEGOTIATING TACTICS WITH PRETTY MUCH EVERY COUNTRY IN NEGOTIATION WITH HIM. THAT SAID I THINK THE EUROPEANS ARE SMART ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND I THINK THERE IS MORE LIKELY A CHANCE THAT A FRAMEWORK GETS ORGANIZED AROUND MORE BASIC TARIFFS LIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. IF ANYTHING, WE WILL ALSO SEE HIM MEET WITH KEIR STARMER, THE PRIME MINISTER OF GREAT BRITAIN WHO IS SET AS THE MODEL OF GETTING DEALS DONE WITH DONALD TRUMP SO FAR. THERE WAS A LOT WHAT THEY -- THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM WHAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ALREADY. JOE: WE WILL SEE IF THAT INCLUDES ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET LIKE KEIR STARMER DID WHEN HE CAME FOR THE BIG VISIT. ARE WE GETTING BEHIND IT -- BEYOND OURSELVES WITH EXPECTATIONS FOR A DEAL WITH THE EU? AUGUST 1 IS A WEEK FROM TODAY. JEANNE: IT WILL BE FASCINATING. WE HEARD FROM JAPAN TODAY SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE. NOT SO FAST. DONALD TRUMP SAID BEFORE HE LEFT FOR SCOTLAND, THERE IS A 50-50 CHANCE. THEY HAVE TO FIND OUT, FROM THE 30%. WE HEAR FROM JAPAN, THE MODEL OF THE DEAL, WE ARE TOLD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THEY ARE IN TWO DIFFERENT UNIVERSES WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUYDOWN FUND. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS WILL BE FASCINATING. UNLIKE JAPAN, THE EU IS 27 COUNTRIES. DEALING WITH A CONFEDERATION IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN DEALING WITH ONE NATION. THEY ARE BOTH HARD. BUT IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE TO GET 27 DIFFERENT NATIONS TO COME ON BOARD. THEY CAN'T DO THAT BY THE FIRST, AND DONALD TRUMP PULLS THE TRIGGER, AND HE MIGHT, APPARENTLY THEY ARE PREPARED TO RETALIATE ON THE SECOND. THE LOSERS ON THIS WILL BE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE PAYING FOR THESE TARIFFS. DESPITE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS, THESE ARE TARIFFS WE PAY, NOT FOREIGN COUNTRIES. TYLER: PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAYS HIS TARIFFS PLANS WOULD GO HAND IN HAND WITH LOWER INTEREST RATES. THE SCRUTINY AND CRITICISM OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE WAS ON FULL DISPLAY THIS WEEK WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITED THE RENOVATION SITE OF THE FED HEADQUARTERS HERE IN WASHINGTON. WE WANT TO PLAY YOU SOME OF THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND FED CHAIR JEROME POWELL WHEN HE VISITED THERE YESTERDAY. PRES. TRUMP: IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS ABOUT THREE POINT $1 BILLION. IT WENT UP A LITTLE BIT, OR A LOT. 2.7 IS NOW 3.1. IT JUST CAME OUT. CHAIR POWELL: I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT FROM ANYBODY AT THE FED. THE THIRD BUILDING, THAT'S WHAT THAT IS. PRES. TRUMP: IT IS A BUILDING THAT IS BEING BUILT. CHAIR POWELL: NO. IT WAS BUILT FIVE YEARS AGO. WE FINISHED THAT. PRES. TRUMP: IT'S PART OF THE OVERALL WORK. CHAIR POWELL: IT'S NOT NEW. TYLER: OF COURSE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE COSTS FOR THE RENOVATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON. RICK, PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT ON TO SAY HE DOES NOT HAVE PLANS OR INTENTIONS TO FIRE POWELL. HE WILL LET HIM SERVE OUT HIS TERM UNTIL MAY OF 20 26. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE OPTICS HERE IS NOT TO FIRE POWELL? WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S ULTIMATE GOAL? RICK: THE PRESIDENT IS A MASTER MARKETEER AND THE FACT HE IS NOT FIRING HIM IS A BIT OF A CONCESSION FOR DONALD TRUMP. WHAT WILL HE GET OUT OF THAT? HE WILL BEAT HIM UP ON COST OVERRUNS AND THE COST OF THE RATE CUTS. AT THE END OF THE DAY I AGREE WITH MARK SHORT EARLIER ON THE PROGRAM. THERE IS REALLY NO DOWNSIDE FOR DONALD TRUMP WITH THESE THEATRICS. SOONER OR LATER, I WILL BE GONE AND RATES WILL COME DOWN AND HE WILL DECLARE VICTORY ON BOTH. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS FILL THE GAP. THIS WEEK'S VISIT TO A CONSTRUCTION SITE THAT -- IT LITERALLY COULD HAVE BEEN A SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE ROUTINE AND IT'S JUST FILLING TIME. JOE: JUST WAITING FOR THE COLD OPEN WHENEVER THEY ARE ALIVE AGAIN. I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING AN EPISODE OF THE APPRENTICE BUT NOBODY GOT FIRED ON THIS ONE. DO YOU SEE THIS THE SAME WAY? MAYBE, WE WILL EXTEND THIS A LITTLE FURTHER. OUR DONALD TRUMP AND JAY POWELL GOING TO BECOME FRIENDS NEXT? JEANNE: I'M NOT SURE. YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN, JEROME POWELL SHAKING HIS HEAD AS DONALD TRUMP PULLS THE LETTER OUT. IT'S A PERFECT MOMENT. I THINK IT IS VERY STRATEGICALLY THAT THERE IS NO DOWNSIDE HERE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I WANT TO GIVE KUDOS TO JEROME POWELL. UNLIKE SOMEBODY LIKE CHRISTOPHER WRAY, WHO, UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER THIS YEAR FROM DONALD TRUMP DID RESIGN, SAYING THAT WOULD BE THE PATH FORWARD TO KEEPING THE FBI ABOVE THE POLITICAL FRAY, JEROME POWELL, AS OF YET IS NOT TAKING THAT PATH. I THOUGHT CHRISTOPHER WRAY WAS DEAD WRONG ABOUT THAT. YOU JUST EMBED THEM MORE INTO THE POLITICAL FRAY WHEN YOU ACCEPT DONALD TRUMP'S PUSH AND GET YOURSELF OUT. KUDOS TO JEROME POWELL FOR STICKING WITH IT. THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FED IS CRITICAL FOR ALL OF US. I THINK YOU SHOULD BE CELEBRATED FOR THAT. HE HAS TO KNOW HE WILL BE PUNCHING BAGS DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH INTEREST RATES NEXT WEEK, CERTAINLY, AND GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE HE'S A PERFECT, PERFECT PERSON FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BLAME SINCE JOE BIDEN ISN'T HERE TO KICK AROUND ANYMORE. TYLER: ANOTHER STORY THAT REALLY DOMINATED THE HEADLINES THIS WEEK THAT WE WANT TO GET TO HAS TO DO WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN. TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP SHARED WHETHER HE HAD CONSIDERED A PART GHISLAINE MAXWELL. REPORTER: WOULD YOU CONSIDER A PARDON OR COMMUTATION FOR GHISLAINE MAXWELL? PRES. TRUMP: I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT. BUT IT IS SOMETHING I AM ALLOWED TO DO. REPORTER: YOU WOULDN'T RULE IT OUT? TYLER: RICK, WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. THERE IS POLLING FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SHOWING PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS VERY SOLID SUPPORT WHEN IT COMES TO HIS BASE. AND OTHER POLLING SHOWS REPUBLICANS ARE NOT TOO HAPPY WITH HOW HE HAS BEEN HANDLING THE ISSUE. 64% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS SAY THEY THINK THE DOJ IS HIDING SOMETHING ACCORDING TO THE RECENT WALL STREET JOURNAL POLL. DOES IT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO FRACTURE A BASE THAT HAS BEEN PRETTY SOLIDLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENT? RICK: I CAN'T IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE MS. MAXWELL HAS ANY INFORMATION THAT WILL BE SO NOTEWORTHY THAT IT WILL RESULT IN THE PRESIDENT GETTING EXCITED ABOUT RELEASING FROM A 20 YEAR PRISON SENTENCE THE BUSINESS PARTNER AND FRIEND OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN AT A TIME WHEN HIS BASE IS SAYING HE'S NOT DOING ENOUGH TO PROSECUTE THE EPSTEIN CASE. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE REACTION OF THE MAGNA BASE -- MAGA BASE WHEN HE LETS GO A TRAFFICKER OF YOUNG WOMEN AND SOMEBODY THAT HAS A TOLERATED SEX ABUSE? THAT WOULD BE A DEATHKNELL. YOU ARE RIGHT. THE SUPPORT HE HAS ON THIS, IN HIS BASE IS HALF OF WHAT HE HAS IN ANY OTHER ISSUE HE IS CURRENTLY PROSECUTING AS PRESIDENT. AS HE IS DOING TODAY, TREAD LIGHTLY ON THIS, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS IS DANGEROUS. JOE: WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF DONALD TRUMP PARDONED MAXWELL? JEANNE: ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE. EVEN THE THOUGHT OF IT. THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT WAS FOUND GUILTY OF THE ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING OF UNDERAGE GIRLS, AIDING AND ABETTING ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS PEDOPHILES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD EVEN CONSIDER IT. THE THING HE SHOULD CONSIDER IS RELEASING THE EPSTEIN FILES. EVEN A BILL CLINTON SAID TODAY, RELEASE THE FILES. SO, RELEASE THEM, MR. PRESIDENT, BUT DON'T RELEASE THE WOMAN FOUND GUILTY OF AIDING AND ABETTING THE PEDOPHILE. THAT'S INSANITY. IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE. IF HE DOES THAT, THE PUNCH BACK WILL BE ENORMOUS. JOE: JEANNIE SHE HAD --JEANNE SHEEHAN ZAINO AND RICK DAVIS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. TYLER: THIS HAS BEEN \"BALANCE OF POWER\".\" WE WILL SEE YOU MONDAY.",

The two leaders are working towards securing a deal in the final six days of the TARIFF deadline. The meeting comes as the US and EU are trying to secure a trade agreement with six days left until the deadline of the deadline to meet. The EU has recently reneged on its favor with the US, citing the potential for a trade deal with Japan as a sign of progress. The White House is also meeting with the heads of state and business leaders in a five-day trip, including UK's Keir Starmer and the EUROPEAN COMMISSION President ARTHUR LAVONDA LYON, along with UK's KEIR STARMER.",
