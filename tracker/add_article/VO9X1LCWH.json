      "summary": "Boeing’s new CEO Kelly Ortberg has halted the company’s decline after a year of turmoil, improving 737 production and securing major contracts, including a sixth‑generation fighter. The stock has risen 39% year‑to‑date, yet Boeing remains unprofitable, lagging Airbus in the single‑aisle market and struggling with debt, a costly acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, and certification delays for new jets. Ortberg’s immediate focus is to boost 737 MAX output to pre‑crisis levels and position Boeing for future models while revitalizing its defense and space divisions.",
