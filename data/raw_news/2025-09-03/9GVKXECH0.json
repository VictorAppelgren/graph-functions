  "title": "The 7 Very Best Toddler Cups",
  "description": "Open cups, straw cups, and insulated water bottles that encourage hydration and healthy oral development.",
  "content": "Like starting solid foods, introducing babies to the concept of drinking from a toddler cup can be messy, but it\u2019s best done early, starting around 6 months old. This gives children plenty of low-stakes practice while making the transition from bottle or breast to straw cups, water bottles, and open cups. Since the muscles and skills needed to drink from a nipple are different from the ones needed to drink from a straw or open cup, you\u2019ll want a cup that sets your kids up for success and doesn\u2019t get in the way of them staying hydrated.\n\nAccording to Kaitlin Wiseman, a pediatrician and co-founder of Playhouse MD, the most important things to look for are cups that are open or free-flow, and straws that are valve-free. Many parents prefer a straw with a valve because valves are what keep the straw or cup from leaking. But they also make kids have to suck really hard to get any liquid out, which can cause them to drink less and doesn\u2019t promote the same oral motor development. Sippy cups are also not ideal, Wiseman says, as well as any kind of cup where you have to bite down to get liquid to flow.\n\nI have spent the past year testing toddler cups with my son, who\u2019s currently 2 and a half, trying to find the perfect combination of leakproof, open flow, durable, and easy to use. There are a lot of duds out there, but with the help of experts like Wiseman as well as fellow Strategist parents with tons of experience, I\u2019ve discovered many excellent options, including cups for true beginners and water bottles for older toddlers.\n\nIn this guide, I am focusing mainly on open cups and straw cups. These two types of cup go hand in hand to help young children stay hydrated and meet the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019s milestone of being able to drink from an open-flow cup with minimal spillage by the time they are 18 months old. According to Wiseman and Solid Starts founder Jenny Best, learning to drink from an open cup encourages healthy oral development including mature swallowing, good lip and tongue control, and eventually self-feeding skills. Open cups are used more often at home during mealtime and straw cups are used more often as a transition between bottles and open cups. Straw cups are often preferred by parents for use away from home, where spilled water or milk is more inconvenient. And as children get older and start day care or preschool, they will typically need a toddler-friendly water bottle to bring with them each day. For open cups, I prioritized cups that are easy for little hands to hold and designed with weighted bottoms or high sides to reduce tipping and help prevent spills. For straw cups and water bottles, I prioritized soft, short, valve-free straws that are safe for toddlers and don\u2019t require forceful sucking to drink. Most toddler cups are made of stainless steel, silicone, or plastic. Of the three, stainless steel is considered the safest material to drink out of and has the added benefit of not holding onto soapy residue after cleaning. It\u2019s very sturdy and lasts a long time but can dent easily when dropped. For this reason, some stainless-steel water bottles for toddlers come with a plastic or silicone bumper on the bottom. Cups made from flexible silicone are a favorite among parents as they literally bounce back when dropped (or thrown). Plastic cups are lightweight and less expensive but the material is less stable and therefore potentially less safe to drink out of, especially if used with hot liquids or if left to sit in the sun. If you are buying a plastic or silicone toddler cup, you should confirm that it is BPA-free and doesn\u2019t contain PVC, BPS, latex, and phthalate materials. Since there is no way to keep an open cup from leaking, they are best used at home where spills are easier to clean up and less of a big deal. Beginner straw cups are often not leakproof because they are usually valve-free, which makes it easier for babies to get used to the feeling of sucking through a straw. But straw cups and water bottles for older toddlers, even those with valve-free straws, are typically made leakproof via caps that stop the flow of liquid when closed. During testing, I shook and turned these straw cups upside down, both with and without the caps closed, to ensure they wouldn\u2019t suddenly leak in a backpack or spill all over the floor at preschool. Consistently cleaning the various parts of your toddler cup is as important as it is annoying. And generally the more small parts the cup has, the more difficult it will be to clean. All of the cups and water bottles on this list are dishwasher-safe (usually on the top rack), but most of the parents I spoke to said they choose to clean the straw parts by hand with a little brush to prevent any mold from growing. Whenever possible, I prioritized cups that are easy to clean. Most toddler cups are pretty simple by design, so details like a particularly easy-to-use flip cap, a wide straw, or a large array of cute illustrations can mean the difference between the cup you almost buy and the one you actually take home. For example: If you have a kid who likes to chew on straws, you\u2019ll want to consider buying from a brand that sells replacements. In my testing, and in my conversations with other parents, these minor details kept coming up either as the reason for brand and product loyalty or the reason they gave up on a cup that initially seemed perfect but ultimately didn\u2019t work out.\n\nNew! You can now save this product for later. Type of cup: Combination sippy, straw, and open | Materials: Powder-coated stainless steel | Leakproof: Yes | Cleaning: Dishwasher-safe I deeply appreciate products that grow with a child, and this toddler cup from Como Tomo, a brand known for its innovative baby bottles, is one of the few options that works well for babies who are just beginning to transition away from the bottle and older toddlers too. It\u2019s basically three cups in one: a sippy cup, a straw cup, and an open cup. It comes with a silicone sip spout and a silicone straw that are easy to swap depending on your child\u2019s age. I know I said above that I didn\u2019t consider sippy cups for this guide, but the Como Tomo\u2019s sippy spout is made of such soft silicone, with a large-enough opening, that it functions more like a funnel that merely slows the flow of liquid, no biting or sucking required. The straw is made of the same ultrasoft silicone; my 2.5-year-old son loves the feel of it and refers to it as \u201csquishy.\u201d The straw does have something like a valve (basically a layer of silicone that\u2019s cut into four sections) to limit leakage, but because the material is so soft, there is virtually zero resistance when drinking out of the straw. My son uses this cup with the straw when we are out of the house and as an open cup at home during mealtimes. For me, it checks a long list of boxes that don\u2019t usually come together in a single cup: It\u2019s made of insulated stainless steel and keeps water cold for hours. It has a push-button lid that makes the cup totally leakproof when the lid is closed, plus a soft valve that prevents it from leaking without the lid, unless you really shake it. It\u2019s small enough to be held as an open cup but not so small that it won\u2019t work for an older child. The handles, which you can remove, have a clever notched design that guarantees they are always correctly lined up with the straw or spout, instead of endlessly spinning around the cup. And it comes in two colors that are bright but not garish. Our Como Tomo has been dropped a bunch of times and the powder coating still hasn\u2019t chipped, but note that it doesn\u2019t have a bottom bumper like some of the other stainless-steel cups on this list. And because the straw is quite soft, it may not be the best option for toddlers who like to chew on their straws. With that said, Wiseman did tell me that soft straws are the safest option for kids just learning to use a straw cup, as hard plastic and harder silicone straws pose a risk of injury, especially among extra wiggly children.\n\nBest (less expensive) toddler cup overall\n\nBest open cup for babies and toddlers\n\nNew! You can now save this product for later. Type of cup: Straw | Materials: Stainless steel, silicone, plastic | Leakproof: When cap is closed | Cleaning: Top-rack dishwasher-safe For my son\u2019s long days at school and after-care, I pack this B.Box insulated water bottle. It has a valve-free straw that is angled to reduce leakage and very easy to drink from, keeps his water cold, is easy for him to open and close, fits in the mesh pocket on the side of his lunch box, and has a hard plastic bumper on the bottom so it doesn\u2019t dent when he drops it on concrete. We are on our second one after the first one got lost at camp this summer. And for a while I was sending him to camp with a Munchkin Cool Cat insulated straw cup that we also tested. But I swear he was barely drinking water on those days because the straw of the Munchkin is so hard to drink out of (both my husband and I have tried using the Munchkin and even with very forceful sucking, we couldn\u2019t get much water). So I bought another B.Box and we have been very happy with it. It has never leaked, except when my son intentionally flicks the straw back in a certain way to make it spray droplets into the air. But that is possible with all of the valve-less water bottles he has used. He has finally grown tired of that game. And it\u2019s very easy to clean by hand, though it\u2019s also safe to put in the dishwasher on the top rack.\n\nBest (less expensive) insulated water bottle for older toddlers\n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

      "text": "This article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\nIn 2019, a toxicologist named Matthew Campen drove into the wilderness of the San Juan Mountains in northern New Mexico with his 12-year-old son. They were working on a school science project about plastic waste, comparing samples from different points along the Rio Grande. In the shadows of the rugged, snow-capped peaks, they knelt at the edge of the river and collected water in glass jars.\nCampen had not been surprised when the water samples they collected from around Albuquerque, where they lived, were full of microplastics \u2014 pieces of plastic under five millimeters, the size of a grain of rice. But when they analyzed the samples from the seemingly pristine forest in the San Juans, he was amazed to find microplastics there, too. \u201cEven near the head-waters of the Rio Grande, it was super-easy to find these things,\u201d he told me.\nCampen, who runs a lab at the University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy, is an inhalation toxicologist who studies the impact of smoking, wildfires, and other respiratory pollutants. \u201cI basically was like, We eat and breathe rocks all the time, and we\u2019re exposed to little particles of diesel,\u201d he said, \u201cso who even cares about plastics? \u201d The results of his son\u2019s experiment shifted his focus.\nEarlier this month, six years after that pivot, Campen published an alarming paper that made headlines around the world. The adult human brain, his research found, today contains about a disposable spoon\u2019s worth of plastic \u2014 roughly 50 percent more than eight years ago. The rate of accumulation mirrors the rate that plastic is increasing in prevalence in our environment. \u201cIt\u2019s frighteningly correlated,\u201d he said when he announced his results. To illustrate his findings, Campen, who is sandy-haired with a youthful face and a wry sense of humor, held a disposable spoon next to his head. \u201cMy prop,\u201d he called it. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t feel comfortable with this much plastic in my brain,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t need to wait around 30 more years to find out what happens if the concentrations quadruple.\u201d\nTo conduct the study, Campen\u2019s lab obtained brain, liver, and kidney specimens from people who died in either 2016 or 2024. To isolate the plastic embedded in the samples, they applied a solution that chemically digested the tissue. \u201cHave you seen Breaking Bad?\u201d Campen asked me. \u201cThey used acid. We\u2019re using the opposite of that. Just a really powerful base of potassium hydroxide.\u201d Whatever remained was spun in a centrifuge to create a pellet, which could be chemically analyzed. Other methods to identify microplastics in environmental samples allow researchers to see particles larger than five micrometers. Campen\u2019s method can detect and measure nanoplastics, which are smaller than one micrometer, or one-1,000th of a millimeter. The particles they saw in the brain samples were 200 nanometers \u2014 about the same size as two COVID-19 viruses side by side.\nHe was astonished that the brain samples had seven to 30 times more plastic than those from the livers or kidneys. One contributing reason may be that brain tissue is extremely fatty and plastics like to glom on to fat. \u201cOur team had to repeat the findings a lot before I was willing to believe them,\u201d Campen said. Nanoplastics, it seemed, can travel almost anywhere in the body, including across the blood-brain barrier, once they are ingested or inhaled and then absorbed into the bloodstream.\nAfter getting the results from their experiments, Campen and his team went looking for even older samples. (\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes a challenge to find brains,\u201d he said.) Eventually, a colleague from Duke University sent him specimens from as far back as 1997. These older brains had even less plastic, a finding that supported the bioaccumulation trend they had seen. Of the 12 types of polymers they detected in the more recent brain samples, polyethylene (used to make single-use bottles, bags, and even, sometimes, utensils) was the most prevalent. It\u2019s also the most common plastic in the world.\nCampen acknowledged that we still don\u2019t know what his findings \u2014 or any discoveries of bodily plastics \u2014 mean, exactly, for human health. But the evidence we have, based mainly on studies of mice and cell cultures, is suggestive. Though correlation isn\u2019t causation, it\u2019s worth keeping track of all the correlations.\nResearchers are studying at least two possible mechanisms for micro- and nanoplastics to harm the human body. By physically occupying space in organs and cells, they could disrupt cell function, block molecular messengers, and trigger inflammation. If the body is constantly producing this inflammatory response, there may be an increased risk for a host of diseases. The presence of microplastics has been linked to cardiovascular disease and reduced sperm count and suspected of links to lung cancer, colon cancer, and dementia.\nOther studies have looked at the way the chemical compounds in these particles might harm the body. Some of the most common additives in plastics, like bisphenols and phthalates \u2014 which make products more flexible, durable, or flame resistant \u2014 have been extensively studied for decades. These additives are known to be endocrine disrupters, meaning they can wreak havoc on our hormones; this can be particularly dangerous for the developing bodies of infants and children. Once lodged in our tissues, microplastics may leach these chemical compounds continually into our bodies. They are \u201cwhat we call sustained-release vehicles,\u201d Don Ingber, a professor at Harvard\u2019s medical and engineering schools, told the Harvard Gazette. \u201cThey\u2019re just sitting there, and every day they\u2019re releasing a little bit for the rest of the lifetime of those cells in your gut or other organs.\u201d\nCampen is now working on experiments that, he hopes, will decisively connect microplastics in the body to human-health effects. \u201cI mean, if you believe at face value the amount of plastics we\u2019re showing in the brain,\u201d he told me, it makes you wonder, \u201cHow are we even alive? \u201d\nI spoke to dozens of researchers who agreed that microplastics represent a public-health crisis. \u201cI can say, with a high degree of confidence, that microplastic particles are in the bodies of virtually every American today,\u201d Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College and the author of a recent major report on plastics and health, told me. \u201cThey are loaded with chemicals, which leach out of the microplastic particles, and cause disease in the human body.\u201d He is frustrated that we haven\u2019t done more to address the problem. \u201cOne of the things you learn in medicine,\u201d he said, \u201cis when you have a sick patient in the emergency room, you have to make decisions quickly, even before all the data comes in.\u201d\nThe word MICROPLASTIC was coined only two decades ago in the 2004 paper \u201cLost at Sea: Where Is All the Plastic?\u201d by British marine biologist Richard Thompson. He and others had found that small colorful fragments of common plastics were extremely abundant along the coast of the U.K. By comparing modern plankton samples with ones from as far back as the 1960s, Thompson determined that the number of microplastics had increased significantly since then.\nThe field of microplastics remained relatively small until the Great Pacific Garbage Patch became nonscientifically famous. A photograph of a seabird with a plastic-stuffed belly went viral, as did a bloody video of a sea turtle with a straw deeply embedded in one of its nostrils. Researchers started to realize, then confirm, that all this macroplastic was slowly breaking down into microplastics, which formed the bulk of the plastic in the ocean. (Less than 10 percent of all the plastic ever produced has been recycled.) These billions \u2014 or trillions, once nanoplastics were considered \u2014 of chemical-laced, weathered polymer specks would persist for eons, were mostly impossible to clean up, and have been found to be toxic, sometimes even deadly, to many aquatic animal species. One study published this past fall included the grim news that microplastics were found in dolphin breath.\nTo chart the increasing volume of microplastics on earth, some scientists turned to ice and sediment cores, which function like tree rings. Each layer is a time capsule, a frozen snapshot of what happened on the planet in one year. When Jenni Brandon was a graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, she analyzed some extremely well preserved sediment cores drilled from the Santa Barbara Basin off the coast of California. In her samples, she found the quantity of microplastics in each layer had increased exponentially since the Second World War, doubling every 15 years. \u201cWe did not expect to get such a nice exponential curve,\u201d she said.\nMicroplastics aren\u2019t confined to our oceans; they fill our atmosphere. In his book A Poison Like No Other, the science journalist Matt Simon wrote that each year the equivalent of 5 billion plastic bottles rains down on the U.S. in the form of microplastics. Inside our houses and workplaces, it\u2019s even worse. One study from California found more than six times the number of microfibers indoors compared with outdoors. Carpets are mostly made with synthetic plastics, as are couches, toys, and blankets. People track microplastics into their homes on their shoes \u2014 the soles can pick up, especially in cities, chemical-heavy flecks of tire rubble, brake pads, acrylic paint, and construction foam. In 2021, a researcher estimated we inhale roughly 7,000 microplastics a day. Just by moving around in synthetic clothing \u2014 items made of polyester, rayon, nylon, or fleece \u2014 I may be individually producing as many as 900 million microfibers each year.\nThe ubiquity of microplastics creates difficulties for those trying to study them. Austin Gray, the co-author of the dolphin paper, told me he spends a lot of his time trying to avoid cross-contamination. When I visited his lab, he opened a tan metal box and removed a glass slide: the preserved remains of a dolphin sigh. In the cabinets above us, Gray indicated the rows of glass petri dishes and beakers covered in aluminum foil. \u201cBecause we deal with microplastics, we clean or heat our glassware,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we cover it with foil to make sure there\u2019s no introduction from the atmosphere.\u201d The process is time-consuming yet necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty tedious, but it helps us control for background. You can\u2019t get rid of everything, but it\u2019s good to do your best and then account for it.\u201d Gray and his students take blank samples from their environment as controls, similar to radio journalists collecting ambient noise. They wear traffic-cone-orange lab coats while they work; fibers from white coats could be mistaken for microplastics in their samples, while orange is relatively rare.\nListing where microplastics are found in our food and beverages starts to become absurd since the list includes most everything. The contamination starts on our croplands, where each year farmers in North America spread up to 660 million pounds of microplastics via sludge, the human waste and other organic matter sourced from wastewater-treatment plants. (In Europe, it approaches a billion pounds.) Sheets of plastic are also used on fields as mulch \u2014 more than 13 billion pounds worldwide \u2014 and then are left in the soil to disintegrate.\nEvery time you eat or drink, you are likely ingesting microplastics. Brandon told me she avoids disposable water bottles and foods wrapped in plastic. More surprisingly, she avoids fancy sea salt because it has approximately the same concentration of microplastics as the ocean from which it derives. No shellfish, either, since bivalves like oysters and mussels are filter feeders. Brandon still uses honey, but when honeybees were discovered to carry microplastics on their sticky legs from plant to plant, she was devastated.\nEven the most diligent efforts may not be enough. This past year, nanoplastics were found in human testes and ovaries, both of which, like the brain, have a blood-tissue shield. Researchers have found plastics in human hair, saliva, lungs, livers, spleens, and colons. Plastics have been found in placentas, in breast milk, and in meconium \u2014 a newborn\u2019s first stool.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you could test anyone and be like, \u2018There\u2019s no microplastics in you,\u2019\u201d Imari Walker-Franklin, a research scientist and the co-author of the book Plastics, told me. At this point, simply announcing your lab\u2019s discovery of microplastics in human tissues is obvious or, as Campen put it to me, \u201ca little bit trivial.\u201d Just as we are made of stardust, we are, increasingly, made of plastic.\nSome of the earliest evidence we have that microplastics can make us sick comes from the 1970s, when a group of textile workers developed lung damage after extensive exposure to synthetic fibers. Later, at a plant in Rhode Island, several employees who handled nylon flock, which is used to change the texture of some fabrics, developed an interstitial lung disease. It came to be known as flock-worker\u2019s lung.\nOccupational exposure is not the same as exposure in the general population, but it can serve as a warning. Even a small amount of micro- or nanoplastic embedded in the body\u2019s tissues could trigger an inflammatory response. \u201cPeople might think, Oh, it\u2019s a low concentration,\u201d one researcher told me, \u201cbut if your body\u2019s constantly producing a response to it, that eventually could lead to an increased risk for certain diseases.\u201d\nIn 2024, scientists in Italy published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine that found a strong association between micro- and nanoplastics in the human body and cardiovascular disease. The researchers enlisted 257 patients who were having surgery to remove plaque from the blood vessels in their necks. When they examined the plaques to see if they contained microplastics, 58 percent did. The researchers followed up with the patients about three years later and reached an astounding conclusion. The patients whose excised plaques contained microplastics were more than four times likelier to experience heart attack, stroke, or death compared with those who had no microplastics detected. They also had higher levels of inflammation in their blood, which is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. \u201cIt\u2019s possible those micro- or nano-plastics may be enhancing, or amplifying, the inflammatory process,\u201d A. Enrique Caballero, a professor at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the NEJM paper, told me.\nOther small studies have found correlations between microplastics and health problems elsewhere in the body. The male reproductive system, in particular, seems to be under plastic assault. Men with severe erectile dysfunction were found to have up to seven types of plastic in their penises. (That study, published in 2024 by researchers in Miami, was the first to detect microplastics in human penile tissue, which was extracted from six individuals who were undergoing surgery to get an inflatable prosthesis.) Microplastics have also been found in human semen samples. One experiment conducted in China, from October, found that all the semen and urine samples from 113 men contained microplastics. The samples that contained Teflon (the chemical PTFE), which coats cooking utensils, cutting boards, and nonstick pans, had reduced sperm quality, lower total sperm numbers, and reduced motility.\nLast year, Campen conducted a study of 158 human placenta samples and found that those containing higher amounts of plastics belonged to mothers who gave birth preterm. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Campen told me, \u201cbecause those infants are, by definition, like three or four weeks younger than full term. So even though they\u2019ve been in existence for a shorter period of time, they seem to have accumulated more plastics.\u201d Again, it was only a small correlation, \u201cbut it absolutely puts plastic uptake in the headlights as a contributor to adverse gestational outcomes,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have published a \u201crapid systematic review\u201d on the human-health effects of microplastics exposure, using strict criteria for the studies they included. They found that, so far, microplastics are suspected of links to colon cancer and certain lung cancers \u2014 diseases that have become significantly more prevalent in recent decades. Since 1995, colorectal-cancer diagnoses have doubled for adults under 55, and lung-cancer rates appear to be rising among nonsmokers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to really pinpoint many of these disease end points specifically to plastic, right?\u201d Walker-Franklin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have all the controls you need to make a causative relationship.\u201d But the correlations keep coming.\nJaime Ross, a neuroscientist at the University of Rhode Island, has been testing how microplastics affect mice. In one study, she added microplastics to their drinking water to see if it would affect their cognitive function. She didn\u2019t expect much, but after only three weeks, the microplastics had already crossed into the mice\u2019s brains. Moreover, the mice were acting strangely, showing signs of cognitive decline similar to dementia. \u201cWe were totally shocked,\u201d Ross told me. She had her graduate students repeat the experiment and got the same results.\nOne important detail in the design of Ross\u2019s study was that the microplastics used were \u201cclean,\u201d i.e., they contained none of the known toxic chemicals commonly found in plastics. They were also free of bacteria and viruses. It was the mere presence of a plastic particle that triggered a reaction \u2014 perhaps simply inflammation.\nIn the real world, most of the microplastics we are exposed to contain multiple chemical additives. \u201cYou\u2019re never just going to ingest pure polypropylene with nothing in it,\u201d Brandon told me. Plastics precursors include known carcinogens like vinyl chloride and benzene, which have caused cancer clusters in several communities located next to petrochemical plants. And in addition to containing endocrine disrupters, the plastics we ingest are weathered by UV rays, heat, and friction \u2014 processes that can result in a variety of potentially hazardous transformations.\nMicroplastics can also help toxins piggyback into human tissue. After plastic breaks down in landfills or the ocean, it can bond with heavy metals or chemicals lingering in the surrounding environment. One such chemical, a flame retardant known as PBDE, has been detected in marine plastic litter and fish. Flame retardants were once commonly used in things like children\u2019s pajamas until a scientist turned activist led an effort to get them banned as a likely carcinogen. Studies have found that PBDE is shown to cause cognitive declines in U.S. children and that rats exposed to PBDE developed liver tumors.\n\u201cInfants and young children are probably the most vulnerable people in the population to the health effects of these chemicals,\u201d Landrigan said. \u201cEverything from autism to cancer to attention deficit disorder to birth defects to low birth weight to stillbirths.\u201d The challenge in getting anyone to care is that these diseases can develop slowly and subtly over years, even generations.\n\u201cThe kids who are affected, in many cases, are not visibly sick,\u201d Landrigan said. \u201cThey\u2019re impaired. They\u2019re not doing as well as they could have been doing had they not had these exposures.\u201d Landrigan was part of the team that pushed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ban lead in paint and gasoline. He sees microplastics as a similar situation in the sense that \u201cthe children who had low-level lead exposure could lose five or ten points of IQ, but they looked okay across the room. It was only when you tested them that you realized there was a problem.\u201d He added, \u201cIt just took time to convince policymakers that these effects were real.\u201d\nImari Walker-Franklin gave birth to her first child, a healthy baby girl named Danielle, this past May. She showed me a picture on her phone: an adorable 6-month-old in a tiny purple velvet dress asleep in her father\u2019s arms next to her beaming mom. When I asked whether becoming a mother had changed how she viewed her work, she burst out laughing. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s another layer of worry.\u201d\nWalker-Franklin, who is 31 and WNBA tall, runs an environmental-science lab focused on microplastics and the chemicals they carry at RTI International, a nonprofit research institute in North Carolina. When I visited, she was overseeing two young chemists who were dosing human lung cells with tire rubble. Bike, car, and plane tires are constantly abrading, releasing invisible plastics into the air as they roll along. Synthetic rubber contains an additive known as 6PPD. When it leaches into the environment, it can transform into 6PPD-quinone, a chemical that has been linked to mass die-offs of coho salmon in the Pacific Northwest.\n\u201cThis is the tire rubble,\u201d Walker-Franklin said, holding up a glass vial the size of a medicine bottle containing black bits, like coarsely ground pepper, in a sooty-black solution. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating whether it has the same reaction on human cells as it did in salmon and, if so, why and under what conditions.\u201d\nThere were three clear vials of brightly colored microplastics on the lab counter, as if the team were about to start a craft project. \u201cWe ordered them from Etsy,\u201d Walker-Franklin said, picking up a vial of green particles labeled AGED HDPE (high-density polyethylene, commonly used to make things like milk jugs, trash cans, and shampoo bottles) and 250-1000, indicating the size in microns. The Etsy microplastics supposedly came from recycling facilities, where they had been crushed from primary products like laundry-detergent bottles into jagged, M&M\u2019s-size fragments. Walker-Franklin then made the pieces even smaller with grinders, sieves, and a CryoMill, which freezes plastic with liquid nitrogen, then pulverizes it into a plastic dust \u2014 an attempt to mimic the diverse sizes and shapes of microplastics in the real world.\nThe particles in this dust were still visible to the naked eye, however, meaning they were bigger than what a person would realistically inhale. (Most environmental toxicologists don\u2019t worry much about particles bigger than 2.5 microns.) \u201cSourcing, or even making, lab microplastics that are environmentally relevant is a huge difficulty,\u201d Walker-Franklin said. Many studies conducted to date have relied on clear polystyrene microbeads ordered from scientific-supply companies, which are machine made, perfectly spherical, and not commonly found in the wild.\nWalker-Franklin\u2019s team was incubating tire rubble and the colorful microplastics with lung epithelial cells for various lengths of time \u2014 a day, a week, or a couple of months \u2014 first to see which chemicals the particles leached and then their effects on cells in vitro. \u201cSome of the concentrations that we\u2019re starting with for dosing are relatively high\u201d \u2014 much higher than what an average person would inhale or ingest, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re mimicking a situation for occupational health or other routes of high exposure.\u201d\nFor tire rubble, this could include workers who recycle tires every day, road-construction crews, traffic officers, or anyone (particularly children) who regularly plays on synthetic turf. Astroturf and other such fields are each filled with an average of 400,000 pounds of tire rubble, known as rubber crumb, to provide springiness, cushioning, and traction.\nOne of the young chemists, Kirstyn Tober, showed me a plate of living lung epithelial cells, which, so far, had been exposed to a tire-rubble leachate for 24 hours. The tire particles had been artificially aged in another effort to mimic real-world conditions \u2014 and they seemed to be provoking a stronger reaction.\nTober pulled a different plate from its incubator and handed it to Walker-Franklin, who placed it under a microscope. The cells had been mixing with a tire leachate for three days, and they were dying. She adjusted the knobs and let me take a look. I squinted through the lens until the cells came into focus. There were paisley-shaped, swollen pinkish blotches, unevenly dotted with dark, dribbly nuclei. An abstraction of cells under stress.\nWalker-Franklin picked up another vial, which contained jagged yellow polypropylene fragments, and gave it a shake. \u201cWe want to understand whether certain plastics are showing more toxicity,\u201d she said. \u201cShould we be focusing more on polypropylene food containers versus tire rubble?\u201d\nThis kind of question is tricky to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tease apart and hard to make blanket statements,\u201d Walker-Franklin said. \u201cDifferent chemicals are used to create different colors, for example.\u201d A blue polystyrene yogurt cup may have an entirely different chemical recipe from a red polystyrene Solo cup. If only one HDPE product is problematic, then \u201cis it really the HDPE, or is it chemicals that were added to that particular product?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is it only toxic when it breaks down in certain environments \u2014 the ocean, a dump, in soil?\u201d Chemical structures can change when exposed to light, so UV-weathered plastics may leach chemicals differently from shiny new ones.\nSo far, Walker-Franklin told me, the tire work was showing what she had expected, but not wanted, to see. The tire rubble was leaching the chemical 6PPD, which was showing up in the cells \u2014 though no one yet understood how \u2014 and some of it was transforming into 6PPD-quinone. \u201cSo we\u2019re seeing the same transformation products in human lung cells as what is actually killing the salmon,\u201d she said, adding that the next steps would be to measure whether the presence of microplastics and their chemicals, like 6PPD-quinone, causes cells to release higher levels of inflammatory cytokines \u2014 the immune system\u2019s artillery against foreign invaders \u2014 and thereby causes more inflammation. She was also going to do what\u2019s called a nontargeted analysis of some microplastics samples to detect all the unknown organic chemicals each one contained.\nWalker-Franklin cited a report that found plastics are made with at least 16,000 different chemicals, of which about a quarter are already known to be hazardous to human health. Little is known about the rest. Each company and manufacturer has its own recipe, its trade secrets. It would be impossible to uncover all the ways they might make us sick. \u201cThere is a need for chemical transparency and chemical simplification,\u201d she said.\nLast year, more than 900 scientists called for a global treaty to better regulate the chemicals in plastics and to end plastic pollution by 2040. Yet the latest international negotiations for such a treaty, which took place in South Korea in late November, failed.\nMany plastics are necessary or unavoidable or good at keeping us safe: tires that don\u2019t crumble, syringes, intravenous lines, N95 face masks, bike helmets. Plastic parts make cars lighter, which means they are more fuel efficient and less deadly, and during accidents, a plastic airbag could save your life. If anything, since certain plastic products are so useful, more effort should be made to eliminate the easily replaceable ones, like single-use bags, water bottles, and excessive packaging. They get us little but a rushed, throwaway life.\nWhen I asked the scientists studying microplastics what they do in their own lives to limit their exposure, they often ended up contradicting one another \u2014 and themselves. The problem is so big, they said, and the needed change so systemic, that no individual action would suffice. Still, Campen told me he avoids fatty meat because of the amount of nanoplastic concentrated in it. \u201cThe way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\u201d (He was more skeptical of other measures, like tossing out your plastic cutting board. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about 90-micron particles,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are boulders. They will go right through your gastrointestinal system.\u201d)\nWalker-Franklin suggested investing in a good HEPA filter for your vacuum because dust is microplastics rich, and be sure to wipe down surfaces and store glasses and mugs upside down. She also recommended wearing a mask in nail salons to avoid breathing aerosolized nail polish from files and grinders and advised against reheating soup in plastic containers. (A recent study found that frequently eating from plastic takeout containers can increase the risk of heart failure.) And instead of buying synthetic clothes, if it\u2019s feasible, opt for natural fibers like cotton, linen, hemp, and wool.\nSince plastic lasts forever, any local fix will be a half-measure. But that\u2019s not a reason to give in to nihilism and do nothing or to lose your mind and throw out all your plastic. Ordering takeout occasionally, cooking an omelet with a plastic spatula, or bringing wet wipes on the plane with your baby isn\u2019t the end of the world. Growing anxious or depressed over the microplastics scourge may be more harmful to your overall health anyway, especially if it leads you to stop exercising and eating well.\nMany researchers I spoke with returned to the need for solutions that are beyond the capabilities of any individual. \u201cI just don\u2019t think people who live normal lives can think about plastic pollution to the level that we would think they need to,\u201d Gray, the dolphin-breath scientist, told me. \u201cLife is hard enough. The onus should be put on the government, on industry, on corporations.\u201d\nIt will not be an easy fight: The plastics industry is the oil industry, which has long foreseen that, as the climate crisis escalates and the energy transition unfolds, the world will use less oil. As that market shrinks, the industry will need to do something with all its reserves. Plastics are its future. According to one report, plastics will make up about one-third of oil-demand growth in 2030 and nearly half by 2050. Currently, single-use disposable plastics represent at least 40 percent of the planet\u2019s annual plastics output, which equals some 400,000,000 tons. That number is expected to double by 2040 and triple by 2060.\nSince Campen\u2019s paper was published in early February, he said, \u201cthe response has been laudatory and deeply somber. People are taking this seriously, even leaders in government.\u201d But he saw the work as just a beginning. \u201cWe have a larger objective of fixing this plastic-pollution problem,\u201d he added, \u201cand this paper has not yet caused changes in policy.\u201d\nStill, he is surprisingly optimistic. He believes wholeheartedly that the U.S. is capable of logical policy solutions, like regulating plastics sales and improving recycling pathways. He cited the Clean Air Act as a model. \u201cI don\u2019t know about a global agreement,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think that individual countries can control their own materials and waste.\u201d He warned, though, that \u201cit will get worse before it gets better.\u201d\nHis son, who originally inspired his father\u2019s microplastics research, will be starting college in the fall. \u201cHis perspectives on plastic are not too different from mine,\u201d Campen told me one recent evening. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s an important concern, but he also thinks it is, hopefully, fixable.\u201d\nIn the year ahead, Campen wants to study which foods have the highest abundance of plastics. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, and it\u2019s ultimately what the public needs to know right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some trends for certain diseases that are worrisome, and people need to look at that. But right now, plastics are a major part of our lifestyle, our health and well-being, and our ability to get food to our table.\u201d\nHis own food was on the table, he said, so he had to go. \u201cThere\u2019s no immediate collapse,\u201d he said before hanging up. \u201cSo, you know, take deep breaths.\u201d"

      "text": "In this article\nThe best lunch boxes make packing a midday meal \u2014 and cleaning up after it \u2014 easy and straightforward. But the exact best lunch box for you will depend on the age of your kid(s), the type of food you typically pack, and whether you prefer packing that food in plastic or stainless steel. It\u2019ll also need to be appealing and easy to use for the kid who will be toting it to school every day. Because it\u2019s rare for schools to offer refrigeration for student lunches, a lunch box with reliable insulation, or an insulated bag that your lunch box fits into, is essential to making sure that everything from tuna salad to yogurt stays fresh and appetizing for at least a few hours.\nTo help you find the best lunch box for you and your family, I talked to teachers, parents, and nutritionists about the lunch boxes and containers they recommend. I also tested several of the options on this list and collected opinions from other Strategist parents who own or have tested them as well. While some of the products below are best for kids in a certain age range, many of them can be used by kids of any age, from preschool to high school \u2014 and even adults, too.\nUpdated on August 22, 2025\nI added several new picks. I also confirmed that all of the products we recommend are in stock and that prices are up to date.\nOur top picks\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nWhat we\u2019re looking for\nType of lunch box\nIn this guide I\u2019m focusing on three categories of lunch-packing gear: bento box, insulated lunch bag, and thermos. Bento boxes have multiple compartments that keep different foods and snacks separate, eliminating the need for plastic bags or individual containers. Insulated lunch bags can be used alone, or as a way to add insulation to a bento box or other containers; they are typically soft-sided and often have additional pockets for ice packs, a water bottle, and utensils. Thermoses are insulated to keep food hot or cold and usually made of stainless steel.\nSize, capacity, and compatibility\nYour child\u2019s age and appetite should determine the size of their lunch box \u2014 the older they are and the more they tend to eat, the more space you\u2019ll need. There isn\u2019t a standard size for any given age group; as kids get older and hungrier, and develop stronger preferences, the options are all over the map (Lululemon reusable totes are popular among teens, for example).\nIf you\u2019re planning to use a bento box within an insulated lunch bag, check the dimensions of each to be sure they actually work as a pair. And even if you\u2019re not planning on nesting two products together, you should have a clear idea of your top priorities before you start shopping, like whether you want a product with room to accommodate a water bottle, ice pack, and utensils.\nMaterial\nThe safest materials to eat off of are glass, stainless steel, food-grade silicone, and plastics that are BPA-, phthalate-, and PVC-free. Glass is conveniently see-through and easy to clean but can be heavy and more fragile, which is why it\u2019s not often used to pack kids\u2019 lunches. Stainless steel is also easy to clean, as well as incredibly durable. Silicone and food-safe plastics are lightweight, durable, and convenient, but instructions will vary on whether you can put them in the dishwasher or microwave. Many of the parents I spoke to prefer stainless-steel lunch containers over silicone or plastic because they are less likely to retain food odors or a soapy taste.\nTemperature regulation\nAnything insulated will help food hold its temperature, whether hot or cold. If your kid prefers chilled veggies or piping-hot macaroni and cheese, look for features like built-in ice-packs, double-walled stainless-steel thermoses, or extra space to include something of the sort.\nLeakproof vs. not\nSome but not all lunch boxes have silicone seals and locking lids to keep wet foods from seeping into your kid\u2019s backpack. Others are better suited for more un-spillable items like PB&J sandwiches and carrot sticks. Many insulated lunch bags have waterproof linings to make them easier to clean, and most bento boxes have securely latching lids. But neither of those features on their own will make a lunch bag or lunch box totally water tight. If there are no leakproof properties mentioned on the label, it\u2019s safe to assume you\u2019ll need to pack only \u201cdry\u201d foods or incorporate additional containers or sandwich bags.\nCleaning\nSpills and stains are inevitable, so take note of how easy the lunch box or food container will be to clean, and whether or not it is dishwasher-safe. Many containers, bento boxes, and lunch bags will require hand washing or spot-cleaning of at least some components, often to help preserve their leakproof qualities.\nExtra details\nLunch boxes with bright colors and fun illustrations are especially appealing to little kids who are still learning how to socialize and might legitimately make a lifelong friend based on a common love of unicorns. And while they are not always obvious in online product photos, small details like mesh inner pockets, carrying straps with buckles, stretchy side pockets for water bottles, dedicated space for ice packs, and removable dividers can dramatically improve the user experience of a lunch box or bag.\nBest lunch box overall\nNew!

You can now save this product for later.\nSize/capacity: Three sizes | Material: Stainless steel | Temperature regulation: Not insulated | Leakproof: No | Cleaning: Dishwasher-safe\nPlanetBox stainless-steel lunch boxes were the ones I heard about most from parents with elementary- and middle-school-aged kids. The brand makes three different single-layer bento boxes: the five-compartment Rover, the two-compartment Shuttle, and the three-compartment Launch. Of the three, the Shuttle is the smallest. Both it and the Rover are designed for children 3 years old and up; the Launch is the largest and designed for children 10 years old and up. They all have the same easy-to-open latch system and durable hinge. And all three can be used with or without a variety of decorative-patterned magnet decals, one of which has space to write your kid\u2019s name.\nStrategist senior editor Winnie Yang has used the PlanetBox Rover with her now-9-year-old daughter for over six years and notes that, despite it being dropped on the ground and crammed into a backpack day after day, it still looks as good as new. And based on Yang\u2019s recommendation, I bought a Rover that I use for day trips and park lunches with my 2.5-year-old son. I typically pack a sandwich, cut-up fruit like apples or strawberries, cucumber or carrot sticks, and a string cheese; then I fill the little circle spot with hummus, a couple goldfish, or two grapes. Strategist senior writer Lauren Ro has also used the Rover with her kids; she bought it about three years ago and until very recently was using it daily with her now-6-year-old son. But she recently switched him to the smaller PlanetBox Shuttle because he said the Rover felt too babyish, despite their similar looks.\nOne drawback of PlanetBox bento boxes is that none of these three models are leakproof, so you can\u2019t safely pack wet foods like yogurt, soup, or pasta with sauce in them. But they all come with either one or two lidded stainless-steel containers that fit inside the bento box to store wet foods. And while the prices may seem high for a lunch box, they are basically indestructible and come with a five-year warranty, plus they\u2019re versatile enough to be used by the same kid for several years. (Bentgo does make a stainless-steel bento box that\u2019s leakproof, and which I\u2019ve reviewed below, but it uses silicone inside the lid to create a seal, and requires a bit more maintenance, which some parents would prefer to avoid.) Overall I gave the top spot on this list to PlanetBox lunch boxes because they are fully stainless steel, can be put in the dishwasher without worry, and have a reliably long lifespan. You can even extend that lifespan, if needed, by repairing worn-out hinge pins or latches with replacements sold on the brand\u2019s site.\nJust take note that while the Shuttle, which measures 7.8 by 5.2 by 2 inches, is small enough to fit inside several of the insulated lunch bags we recommend below, the Rover and the Launch are too big, meaning your best option is to buy one of PlanetBox\u2019s own insulated bags.\nRead more: Welcome to Plastic-Free Kitchen Week\nBest (less expensive) lunch box overall\nSize/capacity: Multiple sizes | Material: BPA-free plastic and silicone | Temperature regulation: Some models have a built-in ice pack; otherwise not insulated | Leakproof: Yes | Cleaning: Food tray is top-rack dishwasher- and microwave-safe\nBento boxes from Bentgo are among the most popular options for preschool and elementary-school kids because they are available in a variety of sizes and designs, easy to pack and open, and not too much of a pain to clean. While many parents prefer using stainless steel, Bentgo\u2019s lunch boxes have the added benefit of a leakproof silicone seal, so you can use them to pack wet foods. Ro uses the classic five-compartment model with her younger son who is 3 years old because it\u2019s smaller than the PlanetBox Rover and comes in different colors and patterns. But for older kids, like Yang\u2019s 9-year-old daughter, the Bentgo Fresh model can hold more food and has a removable divider that allows you to pack food into either three or four compartments \u2014 a level of flexibility Ro wishes existed for the PlanetBox Shuttle. In contrast to the Rover and some of Bentgo\u2019s other bento boxes, the Bentgo Fresh doesn\u2019t have the tiny round compartment that can only hold about ten M&Ms or a small amount of dipping sauce.\nOn hot days, or when she doesn\u2019t want to pack a separate ice pack, Milk Teeth co-founder Rebecca Calavan uses a Bentgo Chill bento box that comes with a built-in ice pack. It\u2019s the same Bentgo lunch box that Strategist senior editor Jen Trolio has been using daily with both of her daughters, now ages 7 and 10, for the past three years; Trolio prefers the four-compartment Bentgo Chill over the five-compartment design since the fifth compartment in the latter is so small. Jessica Garza, a kindergarten teacher in Katy, Texas, who runs the blog The Primary Parade, also uses the Bentgo Chill for her kindergartner and praises how easy it is for kids to open and close on their own. Bentgo recently also released larger and smaller versions of the Bentgo Chill, the Chill Max and the Chill Mini. The Chill Max has one removable divider so that you can have three or four compartments, and while it is bigger (and heavier) than the standard-size Chill, it still fits in the insulated lunch bags we recommend below, so it\u2019s a nice option for hungrier kids.\nBentgo\u2019s bento boxes are dishwasher- and microwave-safe, though technically that\u2019s only true for the inner food tray and only on the top rack of the dishwasher. To preserve the silicone seal, the brand recommends hand-washing the clamshell-esque outer casing.\nBest bento boxes\nBest (less expensive) stainless-steel bento box\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nSize/capacity: Two sizes | Material: Stainless steel | Temperature regulation: Not insulated | Leakproof: No | Cleaning: Top-rack dishwasher-safe\nI learned about this stainless-steel bento box from New York features writer Irin Carmon, who has two kids ages 3 and 5 years old. Carmon told me she finally switched all of her kids\u2019 dishes to stainless steel because silicone took on a soapy taste after washing, bamboo broke, and plastic discolored and warped. The WeeSprouts stainless-steel bento box comes in small and large sizes; she uses the small. Like the PlanetBox bento boxes, the WeeSprouts bento comes with a silicone-lidded container for dressings or dips. \u201cI like that it doesn\u2019t have a bunch of piddling little compartments \u2014 it\u2019s more versatile that way,\u201d Carmon says, noting that she has bought at least three different bento-style lunch boxes over the years, including from Bentgo, before naming this one as her favorite. \u201cBoth Bentgo plastic lunch boxes that we had broke or warped. Maybe we didn\u2019t follow the instructions on dishwashing properly, but if it needs a lot of maintenance it\u2019s not worth it to me,\u201d she says. And compared to the stainless-steel Elk and Friends bento box she tried, Carmon prefers the WeeSprouts because it has a metal lid rather than a silicone one.\nBest bento box for hot lunch\nNew!

Garza also appreciates this feature and adds that, thanks to the bright but not babyish colors, she is able to use OmieBox lunch boxes for both her kindergartner and her tween, packing everything from mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese to soup. Trolio, meanwhile, has the OmieBox UP, which is designed to hold more food for older kids, and though it\u2019s not the lunch box she uses every day, it comes in handy in the winter when she sends more warm food or when her kids are particularly excited about a \u201cbest served warm\u201d leftover like pasta and meatballs.\nBest leakproof stainless-steel bento box\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nSize/capacity: 9.8 x 7.6 x 2.2 inches, 5 cups | Material: Stainless steel and silicone | Temperature regulation: Not insulated | Leakproof: Yes | Cleaning: Hand-wash to protect seal\nIf you are looking for a stainless-steel bento like the PlanetBox Rover but your top priority is that it won\u2019t leak, Bentgo\u2019s stainless-steel lunch box is your best bet. It uses a silicone inner lid to seal each compartment when closed, so that wet foods can sit next to dry without mixing, and sauces or dressings won\u2019t stain your kid\u2019s backpack. It is very close in size, weight, and capacity to the Rover and therefore fits easily into PlanetBox insulated lunch bags, as well as the bigger Bentgo insulated lunch bag, but is too big for many \u201cstandard\u201d lunch bags. I have not yet sent it to school with my 2.5-year-old son because he sometimes struggles with the latches on both the Bentgo and the Rover. But I have tested it with juicy fruit salad, yogurt, and messy pasta to check the seal. Even after turning it upside down and shaking it, nothing leaked out. According to Bentgo it is dishwasher-safe on the top rack, but the brand also says you should hand-wash it to protect the seal. In terms of durability, the Rover has a longer warranty and is easier to repair if the hinge or the latch breaks; where the Bentgo hinge is welded on, PlanetBox lunch boxes use a pin that can be replaced and also sells replacement latches on its site. So in the end, PlanetBox won out over Bentgo\u2019s stainless-steel bento box because this one isn\u2019t fully stainless steel, doesn\u2019t have as long of a warranty, doesn\u2019t have options for repairs, and is higher maintenance, cleaning-wise. But still, if you are looking for a mostly stainless-steel bento box that is reliably leakproof, Bento\u2019s is a solid choice.\nBest insulated lunch bags\nBest insulated lunch bag overall\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nSize: Two sizes | Material: Recycled polyester | Temperature regulation: Insulated; some models also include a cold pack | Leakproof: No | Cleaning: Spot clean only\nElementary-school kids love to express their personal style through their school gear, and for kids who embrace a \u201cmore is more\u201d aesthetic, Pottery Barn Kids has a colorful patterned lunch box (and usually a coordinating backpack) to match just about every interest. When we surveyed kids of all ages about their back-to-school shopping habits, multiple elementary-school kids and their parents mentioned the fun designs; you can even add your child\u2019s name or initials for an extra $16.\nThe lunch bags come in two styles/sizes: classic, which measures 7.5 by 4 by 8.5 inches, and \u201ccold pack,\u201d which measures 9.25 by 3.75 by 7.75 inches and comes with an ice pack that functions as a removable divider. The classic is big enough to hold a smaller bento box, a compact thermos, or a couple of small food-storage containers. The cold-pack design is bigger and more easily fits a variety of bento boxes if you move the cold-pack divider accordingly; just be warned that it still isn\u2019t big enough to fit a PlanetBox Rover or stainless-steel Bentgo lunch box. Some designs are also available in an \u201cadaptive\u201d version, which modifies the cold-pack style to add looped zipper pulls; Trolio, who recently tested one, found these especially convenient to use. She was also impressed by finishing details like a removable, adjustable shoulder strap with notably high-quality hardware, an outer flat zipper pocket, an easy-to-clean interior, and a stretchy mesh side pocket that can hold a small water bottle.\nBest (less expensive) insulated lunch bags\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nSize: 7.28 x 10.43 x 3.35 inches | Material: Coated cotton | Temperature regulation: Insulated | Leakproof: No | Cleaning: Wipe or spot clean\nState backpacks and lunch bags are popular among elementary-school kids because of the huge variety of designs, from glittery gold to sport themes and licensed characters and brands like LoveShackFancy, Barbie, and Hot Wheels. This Rodgers lunch bag, for example, comes in over two dozen different patterns and colors, all of which match the brand\u2019s backpacks. But it\u2019s also easy to wipe clean and has a buckle strap, a removable divider, and two inner pockets: one that\u2019s mesh for utensils and one that holds a Post-it size note or a name tag. You can also get a three-letter monogram embroidered on the side panel for an extra $20. Trolio has tested the State Rodgers Lunch Box with her daughters and reports that while the Bentgo stainless-steel lunch box doesn\u2019t fit inside, both the standard and large sizes of the Bentgo Chill do. She likes how the buckle handle is easy to clip to the the outside of an overstuffed backpack, and her younger daughter especially appreciates how it matches her State backpack and dance bag.\nNew!

It doesn\u2019t fit the PlanetBox Rover, so Yang packs it with an assortment of containers: stainless-steel ones from U Konserve or plastic ones from Rubbermaid for most items, and sometimes a thermos for hot pasta or soup. It comes in ten colors, has an inner mesh pocket and a front zipper pocket, and \u2014 as with other L.L.Bean bags \u2014 you can add a monogram for free.\nNew!

I pack it with my son\u2019s B.box mini lunch box to provide insulation during preschool or day camp. It does its job well and I like that it has two outer pockets: a stretchy mesh one for his water bottle that\u2019s similar to the one on the Pottery Barn Kids lunch bag and easily fits his insulated B.box water bottle, and a zipper one that I use for utensils. The bag also has enough room to add a small snack like carrot sticks or pretzels separately from his lunch box. My son is a car and truck fanatic, but I didn\u2019t necessarily want all of his school bags to be covered in vehicles, so I was happy to find the Bentgo shark pattern that I like just as much as he does. Like the State lunch bag above, the strap of the Bentgo has a buckle that allows me to attach it to a backpack or the side of our stroller.\nBest large insulated lunch bag\nNew!

But at a certain point, most kids grow out of cute prints and smaller-sized lunch bags. This extra-spacious, lightweight lunch bag by tween and teen favorite Hydro Flask has plenty of space to fit a variety of different lunch containers, drinks, and extra snacks. The bag also has an interior zipper pouch that can hold utensils or other small items and two sturdy handles \u2014 one on the top and one on the side. The abrasion- and water-resistant fabric is especially durable and a breeze to clean. And as with other Hydro Flask products, it comes in a bunch of trendy solid colors that older kids will like.\nBest (less expensive) large insulated lunch box\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nSize/capacity: 7 x 8.5 x 6.25 inches | Material: Recycled nylon and recycled polyfill | Temperature regulation: Insulated | Leakproof: No | Cleaning: Wipe or spot clean only |\nThe larger size and cute but cool designs of Baggu\u2019s puffy lunch bag make it a great option for high-schoolers or for adults and caregivers who are packing lunch for a day out with several kids. It is insulated, very lightweight, and can be flattened when not in use. The interior will snugly fit a six-pack of seltzer; or, a kids\u2019 straw cup, an apple, a yogurt cup, and a large sandwich bag or a small stacking bento box. I have used it for everything from car trips to picnics to trips to the zoo. It\u2019s a bit bulky for my son to carry, but Baggu makes a smaller, flatter version of this bag that Ro uses with the Bentgo classic bento box and that I have seen many of my son\u2019s preschool classmates toting to school. Just note that it doesn\u2019t have any handy extra features, like other lunch bags on on this list: no buckle on the handle or removable strap, and no additional pockets inside or out.\nBest thermos\nBest thermos overall\nNew!

It keeps food cold or hot for hours and fits easily into most tote bags or backpacks, eliminating the need for an insulated lunch bag. It is dishwasher-safe and has a protective silicone bumper on the bottom to keep it from denting if bumped or dropped. To boost its insulating powers, fill it with hot water and let it sit for a few minutes before packing it with warm food, or pop it in the freezer for a spell if you want it to stay cold longer.\nBest (less expensive) thermos\nNew!

It also has a silicone bumper on the bottom to keep it from getting dented when my son inevitably drops it, and the lid is easier than the Hydro Flask for him to open. We typically use it to pack oatmeal or yogurt and fruit in the morning so that when we are in a rush, I can feed it to him on the way to school. But I also like to use it for myself; the other day I filled it with some fruit salad from the refrigerator and three hours later it was still almost too cold. We have it in the same shark print as his lunch bag. And because it has rounded edges and no seams inside, it\u2019s super easy to clean.\nBest reusable food containers\nBest stainless-steel food containers\nNew!

The round containers they prefer are available in three sizes: five, nine, and 16 ounces. Yang has owned all three sizes since 2018 and still uses them on a regular basis. She has a similar set from another brand, but says the U Konserve containers are better quality with more snugly fitting lids.

Of all the products she tested, they checked the most boxes: lightweight, leakproof, microwaveable, and easy to store in a small space. The containers aren\u2019t cheap, but they are sturdy enough to last a very long time. They also come in a variety of different sizes and shapes, the smallest of which measures 6.8 by 5 by 2.5 inches and will fit in any of our favorite insulated lunch bags.\nBest reusable sandwich bags\nNew!

They\u2019re resealable and dishwasher-, freezer-, and even oven-safe, so they can be used for cooking and storage beyond packing lunches. They come in a huge range of colors and sizes, from small snack bags to ones that would fit a whole sandwich to ones that can store dry goods in the pantry. I have Stasher bags in three different sizes: pocket size for apple or cucumber slices, a sandwich size for storing cheese or packing a PB&J, and the medium-size stand-up bag for freezing fruit or storing extra pasta. I bought them because I wanted to curb my plastic use. But I also love the colors and how easy and satisfying they are to open and close compared to a Ziploc bag. The seal is impressive, and it\u2019s fun to smoosh the two top edges together. Silber notes that while Stashers might seem a little pricey, they are actually a great investment that last a long time.\nNew!

Kitchens usually makes waffles on weekends and always prepares extra so that she can freeze them for her daughter to eat during the week; she stores them in the gallon size of these Compostic compostable storage bags that you can wash, dry, and reuse. I was surprised to realize they weren\u2019t single use, so I bought a box and have been loving them. They\u2019re perfect for anyone who is trying to cut down on conventional Ziploc bags but doesn\u2019t want to pay the steep price of Stasher bags.

Unfortunately, a small number of people don\u2019t respect those rules, so we\u2019re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\nYou must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems \u2014 for example, by:- introducing malware\n- spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures\n- jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs\n- accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:\n- phishing\n- creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews\n- misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human\n- providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us\n- providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not\n- using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone\u2019s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights\n- reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law\n- using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)\n- using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology\n- hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms\n- providing services that encourage others to violate these terms\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you\u2019re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else\u2019s creative content if they\u2019ve given you their permission.\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.\nWhat\u2019s covered\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nWhat\u2019s not covered\n- This license doesn\u2019t affect your data protection rights \u2014 it\u2019s only about your intellectual property rights\n- This license doesn\u2019t cover these types of content:\n- publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn\u2019t require a license because it\u2019s considered common knowledge that everyone\u2019s free to use.\n- feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.\nScope\n- worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n- non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others\n- royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\nRights\nThis license allows Google to:\n- host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content \u2014 for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go\n- publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you\u2019ve made it visible to others\n- modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it\n- sublicense these rights to:\n- other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose\n- our contractors who\u2019ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below\nPurpose\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\n- operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities.

Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work \u2014 for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\nYou\u2019re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization or business\n- an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms\n- your organization\u2019s administrator may assign a Google Account to you.

You may use Google\u2019s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don\u2019t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\nOther content\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations \u2014 for example, a store owner\u2019s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization\u2019s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations\u2019 content are theirs, and don\u2019t necessarily reflect Google\u2019s views.\nSoftware in Google services\nSome of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\n- worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world\n- non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others\n- royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\n- personal, which means it doesn\u2019t extend to anyone else\n- non-assignable, which means you\u2019re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else\nSome of our services include software that\u2019s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you.

Under this guarantee, we\u2019re liable for any lack of conformity that you discover:\n- within two years of the delivery of goods (such as a phone) or the one-time supply of digital content or services (such as purchasing a movie)\n- at any time during the \u201ccontinuous\u201d supply of digital content or services (such as Maps or Gmail)\nYour national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren\u2019t limited by any other commercial guarantees that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please contact us.\nLiabilities\nFor all users\n- fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation\n- death or personal injury caused by negligence\n- gross negligence\n- willful misconduct\nOther than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.\nFor business users and organizations only\nIf you\u2019re a business user or organization:\n- To the extent allowed by applicable law, you\u2019ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.\n- If you\u2019re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don\u2019t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don\u2019t override those immunities.\n- Google won\u2019t be responsible for the following liabilities:\n- loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings\n- indirect or consequential loss\n- punitive damages\n- Except as stated in the For all users section above, Google\u2019s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) \u20ac500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.\nTaking action in case of problems\nBefore taking action as described below, we\u2019ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\n- cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google\n- violate the law or a legal enforcement authority\u2019s order\n- compromise an investigation\n- compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services\nRemoving your content\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nWithout limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\n- you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\n- we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\n- we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google \u2014 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you\nFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time.

Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland.

If you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, please contact us to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an Online Dispute Resolution platform, but Google isn\u2019t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nIf you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.

You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.\nEEA instructions on withdrawal\nIf you\u2019re an EEA-based consumer, then EEA consumer law gives you the right to withdraw from this contract as described in the EU\u2019s Model Instructions on Withdrawal, provided below.\nRight of withdrawal\nYou have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.\nThe withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.\nTo exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail).

      "text": "Jenny Best is the founder of Solid Starts, an Instagram account and smartphone app focused on helping parents introduce their babies to solid foods through baby-led weaning, and the co-author of Solid Starts for Babies: How to Introduce Solid Food and Raise a Happy Eater.\nThe reason I started Solid Starts is that spoon-feeding my first child didn\u2019t go so well. He really didn\u2019t like the texture of purees, and I didn\u2019t know there were alternatives. At the time, there wasn\u2019t a lot of information on how to introduce real food to babies; like, how do you get from pur\u00e9es to eating a family dinner of steak? That seemed like such a huge leap. So when I got pregnant with my twins, I was basically like, By the time they are 6 months old and ready to start solids, we have to find a different way of doing it.\nI started doing research and found a group of medical experts who were promoting baby-led weaning. A lightbulb went off in my head, because it just seemed to makes so much sense. I did baby-led weaning with my twins and was stunned \u2014 it was just night and day. I couldn\u2019t believe how happy they were.\nSo many parents are overwhelmed, like I was. Maybe you just nailed a nap schedule or you feel like you got into some sort of rhythm, and then the doctor\u2019s like, \u201cLet\u2019s start solids.\u201d To that parent, I would just say this is a process that can take time, and a baby\u2019s primary source of nutrition for the entire first year of their life should be breastmilk or formula. You can take it slow; your baby does not need to be eating three meals a day of solid food until they are around 12 months old. So start in a way that feels right for you and your family. The most important thing is letting the baby feed themselves. That could be putting pur\u00e9e in a bowl and letting them dip their fingers in and lick it off their own finger. That could also be handing over a preloaded spoon of mashed potatoes and letting the baby grab it and take it from you.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThe thing I love about these plates is they are very low-profile, meaning the baby can actually see into them while seated in a high chair and then more easily reach in to grab food. And I think we forget about that. We buy this beautiful tall bamboo bowl or whatever it is, but then the baby can\u2019t actually see the food because the bowl is higher than their eye level.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nIf you\u2019re giving them a leakproof cup, babies won\u2019t ever learn the skills needed to use an open cup. So with my twins, we started with an open cup at around 6 months, as soon as we started solids. What I find works best is to put about an ounce of liquid in there, either an ounce of water or an ounce of breastmilk or formula, and hold the cup in front of them for them to reach and grab with their two hands. You can even put pur\u00e9e in there so it\u2019s more slow-moving \u2014 applesauce or something from a pouch \u2014 to give them a better chance at learning the gradual tipping motion without spilling it all over their face on the first try.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nLong-handled infant spoons make it way too easy for babies to poke the back of their mouth or poke their eye. So for self-feeding, the utensils should really be short. These short pre-spoons are fantastic because the food goes right through the spoon or sticks to it so babies can more successfully taste the food and not drop it. And because of the textured surface, foods like avocado or mashed banana will stick and cling to these more than they would to a typical metal spoon.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nBelieve it or not, when a baby picks up a banana and squishes it in their hand, it cues the brain to learn how to process that food in the mouth. And that can actually reduce the risk of choking and help kids develop a tolerance for different sensory experiences, from food to sand to grass. So, yeah, baby-led weaning is really messy on purpose, and the food is going to go way beyond the area of a bib. That\u2019s why I loved using these smocks instead. I always had at least two of them in rotation so that I wasn\u2019t constantly doing laundry.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nA splat mat will make life so much easier because you can let everything fall down off the high chair and onto the splat mat then fold it up and dump out the food and crumbs versus trying to pick up every tiny piece of rice that might have ended up on the floor.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nFor the messiest meals, I like to use this food catcher that acts kind of like an upside-down umbrella to collect all the food pieces that fall off the tray. Because sometimes, a whole meatball falls to the floor and you don\u2019t want to waste the food, but you aren\u2019t so sure about eating it off the dirty floor. The Catchy saves those pieces and will help you minimize food waste.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nIn addition to open cups, I recommend starting straw cups at 6 months of age because that\u2019s when babies still have a really strong natural sucking reflex, and you want to take advantage of that because it sort of dies down closer to 12 months of age. This cup is excellent for teaching straw skills or helping a baby that\u2019s struggling to get it down. It\u2019s shaped like the honey bear you\u2019ve seen at the grocery store with honey in it, and it\u2019s squeezable. When you squeeze it, some of the liquid inside gets pushed up to the straw and hits the baby\u2019s mouth. Then the brain goes, \u201cOh, I should suck that in.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen a baby not learn straw drinking from this cup. But I will say, parents shouldn\u2019t try to make a cup like this at home from an actual honey bear, because of the connection between honey and botulism before 12 months of age.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nI mean, they\u2019re washcloths. But I love to have really good washcloths around that are nice and absorbent and soft to clean up the mess that comes with starting solid foods. These are worth investing in; I usually had 10 to 20 of them on hand, because with twins I was washing two babies\u2019 faces and cleaning up four arms and wiping up two high chairs several times a day.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nOne of the best ways to help babies tolerate toothbrushing is by using your finger and kind of desensitizing them to having something in their mouth like that. These little brushes cover your finger and have little bumps on them to help simulate a toothbrush. Obviously, because most babies don\u2019t have teeth at 6 months, you\u2019re just gently rubbing the gum, but it really helps them get used to the sensation so down the line you\u2019re not fighting with a toddler. Then when they\u2019re used to the finger brush, you can start using the actual brush that comes in the set. If your baby or toddler really does not like having their teeth brushed, you can sit them on the edge of the sink with your arm wrapped around their waist and let them play with the water to give them something fun to do while you\u2019re brushing their teeth.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nI think there is a fair amount of knowledge around the most common choking hazards, like string cheese, popcorn, and grapes, but I just wanted to put all of the information available plus tips on introducing allergens in one place, so parents don\u2019t have to be researching all over on their own. The Solid Starts app teaches you how to introduce any food to your baby for their particular age and development phase. So whether it\u2019s how to reduce the risk of choking with apples, which are on the list of the ten most common choking hazards for kids under 3, or how to introduce eggs, a common allergen among infants, the app walks you through every step, and the majority of the information is free.

      "text": "Welcome to Plastic-Free Kitchen Week on the Strategist, where we\u2019ve been obsessively researching and testing plastic alternatives \u2014 for everything from appliances to cleaning supplies to cookware. For more, head to our Plastic-Free Kitchen Week hub.\nWhen I decided to divest from plastic in the kitchen, most of the swaps I made came easy. I happily retired the one nonstick pan I had and learned how to cook eggs on a carbon-steel skillet. Tossed my black plastic spatula. Tossed my other black plastic spatula. Until I opened my Tupperware cabinet and came face to face with my beloved deli containers.\nThere is a reason deli containers are used in most professional kitchens and plenty of personal ones. They are easy to store, light as air, and usually free. They come in a range of sizes with universal lids, so I never need to tear apart my kitchen to find the one I\u2019m looking for. They stack perfectly in my freezer. Nest together in my cabinet. Are light enough to throw in my cooler on the way to the beach or pack up a dish to take to a friend\u2019s dinner party. Sure, they can discolor over time or start to melt from one too many washes in the dishwasher. But I never have to feel bad about tossing them when that happens, because they\u2019re so cheap. And they might be killing me.\nOf course, you can reduce your microplastic consumption if you use the deli containers responsibly. But I do not. I reuse most of mine from takeout spots (sin number one), put them in the dishwasher and microwave (sin number two), and pour hot liquids into them all the time (sin number three). So, even though I don\u2019t want to give them up, I think it\u2019s time to find a replacement. My hunt, below.\nThe early contenders\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nI\u2019ve kept a variety of Mason jars in my apartment for years, mostly for drinking water and smoothies out of. I\u2019ve also used them for quick pickling and infusing. As I started my journey of transitioning away from plastic in the kitchen, I started relying on the odd Mason jar or two for storing sauces, soups, and dressings. The wide mouth is a must \u2014 it makes them much easier to clean \u2014 but even with the larger opening it gets a bit messy trying to store other types of leftovers.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nI was intrigued by Caraway, best known for its easy-to-clean nonstick cookware, when I saw the brand had a similarly nice-looking food-storage set available in either 17 or 28 pieces. I tested out the smaller set, which actually only comes with five containers plus 12 accessories of varying usefulness, like the brand\u2019s signature storage racks. The containers themselves feature ceramic-coated glass, which makes them freezer safe, microwave safe, and even oven safe. I was intrigued most by the oven-safe feature until I realized these are basically shrunken-down baking dishes with lids. If I wanted to bake a lasagna and then immediately store it in the fridge, they would be perfect. But for daily needs, they\u2019re quite heavy and bulky. The other problem? The lids, which are not oven safe, don\u2019t create an airtight seal either, so I can\u2019t travel with them if there\u2019s any liquid stored inside. Not that you would want to take these on a commute because of how heavy they are. I also did the math, and I could buy approximately 720 new deli containers for the cost of this set.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nConfession time: I often put my deli containers into the microwave, which is a cardinal sin in the world of microplastics mitigation. So I decided to test out Anyday \u2014 a food-storage set specifically designed to go into the microwave \u2014 to see how it stacked up. While the bowls are glass, the magic comes in with the lid design. Each silicone-gasket lid has a silicone handle in the center that can be lifted up to allow just enough steam to escape to keep the bowl from exploding while trapping enough to evenly warm your food. Then, once it\u2019s time to store the bowl in the fridge, the knob is pressed down to create a seal. It\u2019s nice knowing that I could put these containers in the microwave without essentially boiling my food in microplastics as I\u2019d done in the past. And this totally eliminates the need to place damp paper towels over all my food before nuking it. The Anyday set is nifty but, once again, the heavy glass bowls are a dealbreaker.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nAfter testing out the Caraway and Anyday sets, I went to spend the weekend at my parents\u2019 house and remembered why Pyrex is an oldie-but-goodie. While there are plenty of Pyrex styles on the market, I love the trusty Snapware lids. Not only are they totally leakproof, but they also are stackable. And while Pyrex is not going to win any points for weight, the glass bottoms can at least be nested together.\nThe runner up\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nStrategist kitchen and dining writer Emma Wartzman (who also happens to be the brain behind Plastic-Free Kitchen Week) turned me on to these. While they are made of glass, they were the lightest of all the glass options I tried and the general size and shape of the organizers feels the most similar to an actual deli container. And, most importantly, they\u2019re the only set I tried that has a universal lid system which is a prime feature of deli containers. While Wartzman mostly uses them to decant dry goods in her pantry, I found them to be just as great for leftovers since the silicone lids form a fairly tight seal. Though not tight enough to be travel friendly. However, I do need to give them a demerit since, while they are stackable, they are not nestable, so they take up more space in the cabinet than I\u2019d like.\nThe winner\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nI finally realized I would need to rule out from glass if I wanted something lighter in weight which led me to try this stainless-steel set from Black+Blum. While the London-based company has been making products designed to minimize plastics for well over a decade, it was completely new to me. Initially, I thought I wouldn\u2019t like the opaque bowls, but I found they didn\u2019t really bother me much since the lids themselves are clear so I can still see what\u2019s inside each. And, most importantly, where all the others failed, this set met all my expectations when it came to weight, lid design, and storage. They are by far the lightest of all the options I tried. The Black+Blum set was also the most airtight and leakproof thanks to the vacuum-sealed lid lock. The very first night I unboxed them, my roommate made soup and (bravely) took the leftovers to work the next morning. Not a single drop spilled on their commute. The wider, flatter shape, it turns out, is excellent for prepping ingredients and storing all sorts of leftovers. Plus the different sizes nest together nicely, taking up roughly the same amount of space that my deli containers did. And, like the Anyday set above, they are microwavable due to the specific stainless steel used and the rounded shape of the boxes. Though there are some caveats: You can only microwave for two minutes at a time with lid lock open in microwaves that go up to and include 1000W. While they certainly aren\u2019t cheap compared to my deli containers, they are a long-lasting investment I can feel good about having in my kitchen.\nMore From This Series\n- How Our Readers are De-Plasticizing Their Kitchens\n- Ask the Strategist: Your Most Ultraspecific Plastic-Free-Kitchen Queries\n- Welcome to Plastic-Free Kitchen Week\n- Replace This With That: An Exhaustive List of Plastic-Free Kitchen Swaps\nThe Strategist is designed to surface useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

      "text": "By: Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP\nYou've probably heard that when your baby is around 6 to 9 months old, it's time to begin moving away from bottle feeding. But like many parents, you may feel a little apprehensive about this next step in your child's growth and development.\nIf your little one pouts, shouts or bursts into tears when you offer them a \"big kid cup,\" take a deep breath. Protests like these are totally normal! After all, little humans don't like letting go of familiar habits any more than we do. And the comfort they get from sucking on a warm bottle can be hard to give up.\nLike all growth stages your child will pass through, this one takes patience and time. But there are many good reasons not to give in when your child demands a bottle.\nWhy prolonged bottle feeding can cause health problems\nPediatricians and dentists stress the benefits of training your child to drink from a cup at mealtime as you gradually reduce the number of bottle feedings. Ideally, this transition will begin around 6 months, when you offer your child a cup for the first time. You will then reduce the number of bottle feedings slowly, completing the transition sometime between 12 and 18 months.\nLetting children bottle-feed longer than this can cause them to:\n- Skip meals. Little ones who sip on bottles during the day often don't feel hungry at mealtimes. This may mean they're getting less of the fiber and rich nutrients found in solid foods. If you're begging your child to eat, bottles might be the cause.\n- Reach an unhealthy weight. For many kids, bottles become high-calorie meal supplements and snacks, leading to toddler obesity. And while many people find chubby toddlers adorable, pediatricians point out that early obesity sets the stage for weight (and health) problems later in life.\n- Develop cavities. Early childhood caries, sometimes called \"baby bottle tooth decay\" or baby tooth cavities, happen when your child's teeth are constantly bathed in milk, formula, juice or other drinks. Little ones who drink from bottles well into their second year may also have tooth alignment problems and even speech delays, since little mouths need to strengthen the muscles for clear speech.\n- Resist even more. Toddlers cling to their bottles even more fiercely as time goes by. This can trigger a major power struggle between you and your child, so starting early is the healthiest path for both of you.\nTips for a smoother transition to drinking from a cup\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you offer your child a cup when they start eating solid foods, usually around 6 months. You can use a \"sippy\" (training) cup with a spouted lid or offer a cup and straw. Some children may choose to drink from an open cup without a straw \u2013 and that's just fine, too.\nSippy cups should be used only while little ones are learning. It's healthiest for kids to drink from an open cup by about 2 years of age. (If your child has a chronic illness, physical differences or shows signs of small motor skill delay, ask your pediatrician to help you put together a schedule that follows your child's abilities.) When your child is using a sippy cup, only fill them with plain fluoridated water without juice or sugar.\nMove away from the bottle gradually. When you begin weaning, tell your child they can drink from a bottle at mealtimes. Gradually eliminate bottle feedings at other times, especially naps or bedtime. Be ready to offer extra snuggles, songs or bedtime stories so your child feels reassured, but learns to self-soothe without a bottle. Giving your child plain water in bottles between meals and then moving to plain water in sippy cups or cups can help with the transition.\nStart offering a cup to your child as early as 6 months. Bring one to the table with your child's plate and encourage them to give it a try. Begin by putting formula or breast milk in their cup\u2014whatever they're drinking already. (This might feel more natural than starting with water.) As they get the hang of things, you can fill their cup with plain water at mealtimes, too.\nCelebrate their success. Notice your little one's progress and offer them praise. If it feels right, put on party hats and sing a happy tune. Your child is eating and drinking like a big kid, which helps set the stage for lifelong health. Hooray!\nIf your child balks, do a little investigating. Maybe they aren't thirsty when you offer them a mealtime drink, and that's okay. Model good habits by drinking water when you eat together. If they seem to need a little more attention, don't hold back. \"Wow, you took a sip! Good job! I love seeing you drink from your big-kid cup.\"\nBring everyone into the act. Let daycare providers, sitters, grandparents, siblings and friends know that your child is building a new skill. Other caregivers need to follow the same routine so your child can move forward.\nIssues to watch for along the way\nBottle weaning can be tricky, so it's smart to know some of the challenges that parents and caregivers sometimes face. Here are a few extra tips for you.\nOffer cups mainly at mealtime. Little ones who carry their cups around all day like security blankets may drink way too much (and need more frequent diaper changes). If your toddler is thirsty, offer them a little plain water, but then set the cup aside and remind them it will be there when it's time to eat.\nTrust your child to self-soothe without a bottle. Temporary sleep problems can turn into serious struggles if you give in to your child's protests and offer a bottle at bedtime. Create a healthy new routine when your little one can snuggle with you, listen to a story or soft music and drift off. A pacifier may also help.\nOffer healthy beverages. Plain water is the healthiest drink for your child, and the fluoride in tap water helps prevent tooth decay. (If you're wondering how fluoride works and whether it's safe for kids, here's a helpful article.)\nMilk and juice contain natural sugars that deliver extra calories and increase cavity risks, so offer small portions. Avoid drinks with added sugar, especially carbonated beverages, which damage tooth enamel.\nAs your child transitions to an open cup, place one next to the bathroom sink or water dispenser so they can serve themselves. Help them practice with the faucet or dispenser valve and offer praise for progress. (Another big-kid milestone to celebrate!)\nChoosing the right cup for your child\nThere are literally hundreds of choices out there, so this can be confusing. Many sippy cups have a valve under the spout to stop spills. But kids have to suck to get any liquid from them, which is just like drinking from a baby bottle. Not at all helpful for learning and development!\nIf you prefer a sippy cup rather than an open cup (with or without straw), choose one with no valve. It should have a snap-on or screw-on lid with a simple spout. Opt for one with two handles to help little hands get a grip. Some cups have a weighted base that pulls them upright when they tip\u2014great for minimizing spills. But remember, the sippy cup is an optional step toward using a \"regular\" cup. Many children transition from breast or bottle to a regular cup without a sippy cup in between!\nWhat about breastfed babies?\nWith many parents pumping for convenience, little ones may drink breast milk from bottles as part of their regular routine. In this case, breastfeeding parents can follow the same steps for weaning from a bottle to a cup as those who use formula.\nIf you have used no bottles at all, you can introduce a cup filled with breast milk around 6 months of age.\nRemember\nYour child's resistance to using a cup doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Be patient and trust that your little one will gradually start drinking like a big kid.\nIf resistance turns into a full-blown power struggle, talk with your pediatrician. Also consult your pediatrician if your child has a chronic illness, physical difference or developmental delay that will affect their ability to move away from bottle feeding.\nMore information\nAbout Dr. Shu\nJennifer Shu, MD, FAAP, medical editor of HealthyChildren.org, is a board-certified pediatrician, author and mother living in Atlanta.

You will continue to receive generic ads while online or on your device.\nMobile\nWe may from time to time offer certain location or pinpoint based services, such as location assisted navigation instruction. If you elect to use such location-based services, we must periodically receive your location in order to provide such location-based services to you.

This information will be used to provide you the location-based services.

We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n15.\nSecurity\nWe have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures to help protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure; unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security. You use the Services and provide us with information at your own initiative and risk. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us using the details in the Contact Us section below.\n16.\nLinks\nThe Services contain links to other websites that we do not control, and the Services contain videos, advertising and other content hosted and served by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party.

Most of our Services, with the exception of certain child-directed services as described below, are intended for a general audience and are not intended for and should not be used by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 on our general audience services, and we do not target such services to children under the age of 16.\nSome of our Services are clearly identified as being marketed directly to children under the age of 16 (such as our Dodo Kids channel or other child-directed services). In connection with such child-directed services, we do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from users under the age of 16 without complying with applicable legal requirements and making appropriate disclosures. We are committed to compliance with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d), a U.S. federal law designed to protect children online. We may collect and store persistent identifiers (such as IP addresses) from children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.\nFor any of our Services, if a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below. We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.\n18.\nSensitive Personal Data\nWhen we conduct research or carry out surveys and you participate in our research or surveys, we may collect sensitive Personal Data about you, for example, information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation.

Otherwise, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Data as this term is defined under applicable data protection and privacy laws on or through the Services or otherwise to us.\nIf you send or disclose any sensitive Personal Data to us or the public through the Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data, you must not submit such content to our Services, and you must contact us to make us aware immediately.\n19.\nImportant Information for California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nWe collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nIf European Union or United Kingdom data protection law applies to the processing of your information, you can review the European requirements section below to learn more about your rights and Google\u2019s compliance with these laws.\nContents\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\n- Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\n- Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\n- Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\nInformation Google collects\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\nWhen you\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\nThings you create or provide to us\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\nInformation we collect as you use our services\nYour apps, browsers & devices\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\u2019re using your Android device.\nYour activity\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\n- Terms you search for\n- Videos you watch\n- Views and interactions with content and ads\n- Voice and audio information\n- Purchase activity\n- People with whom you communicate or share content\n- Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\n- Chrome browsing history you\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\u2019s saved in your account.\nYour location information\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\nDepending on the products you\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\n- IP address\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\nProvide our services\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\nMaintain & improve our services\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\nDevelop new services\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\n- We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\nMeasure performance\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\nCommunicate with you\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\nWe\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\u2019ve saved with Google.\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\nPrivacy controls\nActivity Controls\nDecide what types of activity you\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\nAd settings\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\nWhen you\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\nWhen Google shares your information\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\nWith your consent\nWe\u2019ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent.

      "text": "Conscious Cup - 8 oz\nAhimsa dishware is built to last a lifetime with no peeling or breaking. To read our full lifetime warranty, click here.\n- Dishwasher safe.\n- Avoid using abrasive cleaning tools and harsh detergents (including steel wool and dishwasher pods/ powerballs) to preserve the titanium color finish and keep products in optimal condition.\n- Stackable design \u2014 say bye-bye to clutter!\n- Please supervise children at mealtime for safety, especially young children under 3.\n- Take care when handling or serving hot foods and liquids.\n- Do not microwave.\nDesigned with busy parents in mind.\nBuilt for a lifetime of health.\nAhimsa is consciously crafted of high quality food-safe stainless steel and titanium. Our dishes are free of BPA (and all bisphenols), PVC, phthalates, lead, siloxanes, melamine and formaldehyde\u2014meaning that harmful chemicals won't transfer into your child's food.\nWhy stainless steel?\nWhile plastic, melamine and even BPA-free dishware, flatware, and drinkware made for kids is often a go-to choice, science says it\u2019s not the best for their development. Stainless steel, however, brings a healthier, more sustainable, and effortlessly fun option to the table\u2014for life.\nDoctor designed, kid approved.\nEach Ahimsa piece is intentionally sized to promote early motor skills and confidence, while offering easy measurements for healthy portioning at every age. Kids love our colorful reflective surfaces and won't want to eat with anything else!\nQuestions? We're here to help.\n-\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a report in July 2018 suggesting ways that families can limit exposure to certain chemicals at mealtime, including \u201cthe use of alternatives to plastic, such as glass or stainless steel, when possible.\u201d The report explained that \u201c\u2026some additives are put directly in foods, while \u201cindirect\u201d additives may include chemicals from plastic, glues, dyes, paper, cardboard\u201d. Further, \u201cChildren are more sensitive to chemical exposures because they eat and drink more, relative to body weight, than adults do, and are still growing and developing.\u201d While stainless steel items meet the recommendation to avoid plastic products in children, Ahimsa\u00ae products have the obvious advantage of not breaking like glass.\n-\nThe first years set the stage for healthy habits for the rest of your child\u2019s life. It\u2019s never too early to start.\nBalanced Bites Plates:\nOur compartment plates are a visual map for parents to plan and for children to learn about the importance of food variety at each meal. Additionally, parents have found by using stainless steel rather than dinnerware that can be microwaved \u2013 they are choosing more healthy, fresh foods for their children.Cups:\nAhimsa cups are not only inert stainless steel and therefore, nontoxic and do not leach chemicals \u2013 but they are also the perfect size for small hands. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry advises that sippy cups should not be used for extended periods of time due to tooth decay. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association discourages sippy cups because they can interfere with a child\u2019s ability to develop a mature swallowing pattern. We are so happy to offer cups that promote health not only due to their makeup, size and structure \u2013 but also to encourage healthy teeth, eating and speech development.Cutlery:\nEncouraging children to use utensils during meals helps with pincer grasp and fine motor development. Parents have shared with us that their children often chose not to use their utensils until they started using our brightly colored cutlery and then continued to do so through habit.\n-\nNo. Our steel is durable, so it won\u2019t break or shatter with everyday use, like glass. And it won\u2019t peel, like other colored stainless steel products you\u2019ve seen. We use a special process that allows the colors to naturally occur in the metal.\n-\nAccording to the Steel Recycling Institute, steel can be recycled over and over and over again without losing its integrity and requires less energy to recycle than to make anew. Most plastic unfortunately ends up in landfills and it is estimated to take 700 years to decompose. Our special coloring process that allows Ahimsa\u00ae products to be fully metal is environmentally friendly, so it does not produce toxic run-off into the ecosystem."

      "text": "Best in Class is what we call our series of carefully chosen, rigorously vetted flagship shopping guides. The goal of each Best in Class post is to help you, the reader, find exactly what you\u2019re looking for, whether it\u2019s a brand-new bidet or a protein powder that\u2019s not sludgy or a sleeper sofa that isn\u2019t completely hideous. And though we cover a breadth of topics, the methodology for coming up with these product picks is standardized across our eight primary categories \u2014 Beauty, Home, Kids and Babies, Kitchen, Style, Tech, Travel, and Wellness.\nOur writers are each deeply embedded in their categories (and you can learn more about each of our staffers and their areas of expertise here). But they are also journalists, with access to a vast network of experts in their fields who are ready to answer questions about what works, what\u2019s a myth, and what stands the test of time. However, we should note that \u201cexpert\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean doctor or scientist \u2014 even though we do interview lots of them. We want to talk with people who have a particular set of authority and knowledge, like professional chefs on the pots and pans they use for everyday cooking, stylists on the no-show underwear they recommend to clients before they hit the red carpet, and even Park Slope parents on understanding what stroller is rugged enough to make it through Prospect Park. The process of writing any Best in Class guide starts with a series of interviews with these vetted sources, to get a lay of the land, start to narrow down a list of products to call in and try out, and understand what we should be looking out for while testing.\nOur writers will also add more products to the list of ones to test based on their own research and personal experience \u2014 even if no expert has explicitly recommended it to them. Is there a rug that no interior designer recommended but we saw in Laila Gohar\u2019s living room? Is there a new face wash on the market that Gen Z is buying in hoards? Have Lance Bass and Samantha Irby both raved about the same water bottle, when we asked them about what they can\u2019t live without? We want to know if these work, too.\nFrom there, our writers get to testing the products. The testing process varies from product to product and story to story. Our kitchen and dining writer might test dozens of chef\u2019s knives and sheet pans at home over the course of a few months, while our furniture writer might visit showrooms all over New York to sit on couches. We will always explicitly outline our methodology in the introduction of our posts. And this testing process is ongoing, so we\u2019ll frequently update our Best in Class guides when we learn about an updated model or discover a new product.\nAfter all that work is done, we\u2019ll write our guide. Here, we\u2019re breaking down each section of our Best in Class guides, so you can better understand why we\u2019ve shown our work in this particular way.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking For\nHere, our writer will highlight the nitty-gritty product features that readers should care most about, based on their hands-on experience and interviews with experts. The details we feature will depend on what product we\u2019re writing about \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the material or the active ingredient or the size \u2014 but we will always endeavor to highlight the specs that would be most helpful for you, as a reader, to understand how to make the best purchase decision. You can think of this as our criteria, the ruler against which we\u2019ll be measuring all products in the piece.\nOur Picks\nEvery Best in Class guide will have a \u201cbest overall\u201d pick. This product is the one that our writer believes is truly best in class, out of everything that they\u2019ve tested, reported, and researched, and it should be the one that best matches the writer\u2019s stated criteria, as outlined in \u201cWhat We\u2019re Looking For.\u201d We always endeavor to make sure our best overall pick is accessible. That means keeping price in mind, along with merchants and availability. So even if a bespoke pair of Japanese selvedge jeans are the very best, it doesn\u2019t make sense to name that the best overall pick if they\u2019re never in stock or take five weeks to ship or cost twice as much as anything else in the guide. If we are recommending the most expensive item as the best overall, we will always be sure to explain why it\u2019s worth the splurge.\nWe\u2019ll almost always include a \u201cbest (less expensive) overall\u201d pick, and if we do, we\u2019ll explain how it compares to our best overall pick.\nWe also know that each shopper has a different budget and personal needs, so from there, our writers will also identify other top products in the category, with specific subheads.\nOur Experts\nThis section will appear at the end of all Best in Class guides, listing every expert the writer spoke with while reporting this guide \u2014 even if they are not directly quoted in the piece.\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape. Some of our latest conquests include the best acne treatments, rolling luggage, pillows for side sleepers, natural anxiety remedies, and bath towels. We update links when possible, but note that deals can expire and all prices are subject to change."

If you believe a user of the Services is infringing your copyright, please provide written notice to our agent listed below for notice of claims of copyright infringement.\nVox Media, LLC\n1701 Rhode Island Avenue NW,\nWashington, DC 20036\nTel: (202) 591-1140\nEmail: copyright@voxmedia.com\nYour written notice must: (a) contain your physical or electronic signature; (b) identify the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed; (c) identify the allegedly infringing material in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material; (d) contain adequate information by which we can contact you (including postal address, telephone number, and email address); (e) contain a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, the copyright owner\u2019s agent, or the law; (f) contain a statement that the information in the written notice is accurate; and (g) contain a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. Please do not send notices or inquiries unrelated to alleged copyright infringement to our designated copyright agent.\nIf you believe that your trademark is being used somewhere on the Services in a way that constitutes trademark infringement, the owner or an agent of the owner may notify us at copyright@voxmedia.com. We ask that any complaints provide the accurate identity of the owner, how we may contact you, and the specific nature of the complaint.\nIf you believe in good faith that someone has wrongfully filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see www.loc.gov/copyright. Send counter-notices to the same addresses listed above and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider\u2019s address is located, or, if the content provider\u2019s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.\nIf a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company\u2019s discretion.\nIf the Sites receive more than one Notice of Copyright Infringement concerning a user, the user may be deemed a \u201crepeat copyright infringer.\u201d The Sites reserve the right to terminate the accounts of \u201crepeat copyright infringers.\u201d\nMaterial on our Sites may include inaccuracies or typographical errors.

We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or any delay in the performance of, any of our obligations under these Terms that is caused by any event or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including any failure of public or private telecommunications networks or any delays or latency due to your physical location or your wireless data service provider\u2019s network. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in no event shall our liability to you exceed the amount of fees you paid us (if applicable) for a period of three months prior to the date you submit a claim.\n17. Exclusions and Limitations\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\u201d\n19. Arbitration Agreement\nPlease read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Vox Media, LLC, and any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, brands and entities that it controls, including Curbed, Eater, Grub Street, New York Magazine, Polygon, POPSUGAR, Recode, SB Nation, Select All, The Cut, The Daily Intelligencer, The Dodo, The Strategist, The Verge, Thrillist, Vox, Vulture, and other affiliated sites, properties, or applications (collectively \u201cVox Media,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. Both you and Vox Media acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Vox Media\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof. Any arbitrations filed after the date these terms go into effect must comply with these arbitration provisions.\nThe parties agree that this Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16.\nPre-Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Procedure\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Vox Media must be emailed to TOS.Disputes@voxmedia.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). A Notice to you by Vox Media must be sent to the email address associated with your Vox Media subscription or Membership, if applicable. Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; and (if different) the email address associated with the relevant Vox Media subscription or Membership; (ii) if you are submitting the Notice, how and when you became a member, your membership history, and current membership status; (iii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, including any relevant facts, and if you are submitting the Notice, facts pertaining to your use of Vox Media communities and sites ; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice; and (vi) if you are the claimant and are represented by counsel, your signed statement authorizing Vox Media to disclose your Vox Media membership details to your attorney while seeking to resolve your claim. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute.\nAfter receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).\nCompliance with this section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures. All of the procedures are essential so that you and Vox Media have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of these procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these procedures in arbitration.\nArbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitrationThe arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by the NAM. (If the NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 5.) The NAM Rules are available online at https://namadr.com/ by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For all non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in Washington, DC, District of Columbia.\nYou and we agree as otherwise expressly provided herein and except as to the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution requirements referenced above and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement, applicability of the SOL, whether claim can or should be brought in small claims, whether a plaintiff or the company has complied with the pre-arbitration notice and negotiation requirements, or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration (including whether a dispute is subject to this Arbitration Agreement or a previous arbitration provision between you and Vox Media), which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.\nAt the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Vox Media and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.\nAs in court, you and Vox Media agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.\nExcept as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including the awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in accordance with applicable law. You and we agree that dispositive motions shall be allowed in any arbitration if requested by either party.\nIn any arbitration between you and Vox Media, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.\nCosts of Arbitration\nUnless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees.\nSmall Claims Court; Infringement\nEither you or Vox Media, LLC may elect to have any claim that qualifies for small claims court in the United States county where you live or work heard by such small claims court. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\nWaiver of Jury Trial\nYOU AND VOX MEDIA WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Vox Media are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Vox Media over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND VOX MEDIA WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Vox Media is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth below.\nMass Filings Procedure\nIf, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements herein, until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Arbitrator selection for each batch or stage shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and shall be subject to any rights to strike an arbitrator provided under applicable state law if the rights granted by law exceed those provided for in the NAM rules, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.\nStage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 10 claims per side (20 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Vox Media shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee.\nStage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 20 claims per side (40 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Vox Media shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee.\nStage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Vox Media shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge.\nIf your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:\nOption One: You and Vox Media may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have the claim heard in court consistent with the Agreement. You may opt out of arbitration by providing your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by sending Vox Media an email to TOS.Disputes@voxmedia.com. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation associated with Stage 3. Vox Media may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30 day opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.\nOR\nOption Two: If neither you nor Vox Media elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.\nA court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement.\nYou and Vox Media agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Vox Media acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.\nOpt-out\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:\nVox Media Inc., 1701 Rhode Island Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement. Notices sent to any other address, or sent by electronic mail or communicated orally, will not be accepted or effective. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Vox also will not be bound by it.\nExclusive Venue\nIf you send the opt-out notice and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Vox Media to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then both you and Vox Media agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Washington, DC, District of Columbia, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n20.

      "text": "Every product that appears on the Strategist has been independently selected by our rather obsessive staff (and you can read more about our editorial guidelines here). That means our mighty team of journalists is constantly testing products, interviewing experts and people with good taste for recommendations, tracking trends and launches, and keeping one eye open for actually good deals. We\u2019re constantly chatting among ourselves, sharing shopping tips and one-of-a-kind finds. We\u2019ve even created a Slack channel, called #strat-chats, for the express purpose of talking about the things we\u2019re most excited to buy.\nEach of our writers has deep expertise and experience around their subject matter, and their knowledge often extends far beyond what they\u2019re doing at work. (Take, for example, our fitness writer, who logged over 1,900 miles of running last year, or our travel writer, who dabbled in van life for eight months.) And though we always endeavor to show our work in our guides and reviews, here, we wanted to take a moment to show off the people behind the product recommendations.\nArielle is a writer covering wardrobe basics and personal care, and she regularly contributes to The Strategist Beauty Brief.

      "text": "Conscious Cup - 8 oz\nAhimsa dishware is built to last a lifetime with no peeling or breaking. To read our full lifetime warranty, click here.\n- Dishwasher safe.\n- Avoid using abrasive cleaning tools and harsh detergents (including steel wool and dishwasher pods/ powerballs) to preserve the titanium color finish and keep products in optimal condition.\n- Stackable design \u2014 say bye-bye to clutter!\n- Please supervise children at mealtime for safety, especially young children under 3.\n- Take care when handling or serving hot foods and liquids.\n- Do not microwave.\nDesigned with busy parents in mind.\nBuilt for a lifetime of health.\nAhimsa is consciously crafted of high quality food-safe stainless steel and titanium. Our dishes are free of BPA (and all bisphenols), PVC, phthalates, lead, siloxanes, melamine and formaldehyde\u2014meaning that harmful chemicals won't transfer into your child's food.\nWhy stainless steel?\nWhile plastic, melamine and even BPA-free dishware, flatware, and drinkware made for kids is often a go-to choice, science says it\u2019s not the best for their development. Stainless steel, however, brings a healthier, more sustainable, and effortlessly fun option to the table\u2014for life.\nDoctor designed, kid approved.\nEach Ahimsa piece is intentionally sized to promote early motor skills and confidence, while offering easy measurements for healthy portioning at every age. Kids love our colorful reflective surfaces and won't want to eat with anything else!\nQuestions? We're here to help.\n-\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a report in July 2018 suggesting ways that families can limit exposure to certain chemicals at mealtime, including \u201cthe use of alternatives to plastic, such as glass or stainless steel, when possible.\u201d The report explained that \u201c\u2026some additives are put directly in foods, while \u201cindirect\u201d additives may include chemicals from plastic, glues, dyes, paper, cardboard\u201d. Further, \u201cChildren are more sensitive to chemical exposures because they eat and drink more, relative to body weight, than adults do, and are still growing and developing.\u201d While stainless steel items meet the recommendation to avoid plastic products in children, Ahimsa\u00ae products have the obvious advantage of not breaking like glass.\n-\nThe first years set the stage for healthy habits for the rest of your child\u2019s life. It\u2019s never too early to start.\nBalanced Bites Plates:\nOur compartment plates are a visual map for parents to plan and for children to learn about the importance of food variety at each meal. Additionally, parents have found by using stainless steel rather than dinnerware that can be microwaved \u2013 they are choosing more healthy, fresh foods for their children.Cups:\nAhimsa cups are not only inert stainless steel and therefore, nontoxic and do not leach chemicals \u2013 but they are also the perfect size for small hands. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry advises that sippy cups should not be used for extended periods of time due to tooth decay. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association discourages sippy cups because they can interfere with a child\u2019s ability to develop a mature swallowing pattern. We are so happy to offer cups that promote health not only due to their makeup, size and structure \u2013 but also to encourage healthy teeth, eating and speech development.Cutlery:\nEncouraging children to use utensils during meals helps with pincer grasp and fine motor development. Parents have shared with us that their children often chose not to use their utensils until they started using our brightly colored cutlery and then continued to do so through habit.\n-\nNo. Our steel is durable, so it won\u2019t break or shatter with everyday use, like glass. And it won\u2019t peel, like other colored stainless steel products you\u2019ve seen. We use a special process that allows the colors to naturally occur in the metal.\n-\nAccording to the Steel Recycling Institute, steel can be recycled over and over and over again without losing its integrity and requires less energy to recycle than to make anew. Most plastic unfortunately ends up in landfills and it is estimated to take 700 years to decompose. Our special coloring process that allows Ahimsa\u00ae products to be fully metal is environmentally friendly, so it does not produce toxic run-off into the ecosystem."

      "text": "Jump to section\nAs essential to a summer wardrobe as a swimsuit or sun hat, sandals will take you from your 100-degree commute to your 10,000-step vacation. But a great pair can be surprisingly hard to find. Often, the ones that look chicest leave blisters, while the most comfortable ones leave something to be desired in the style department. But good news: As the Strategist\u2019s resident style writer, I\u2019m rather obsessive (and opinionated) about what makes for a great sandal, and I found many for this list by asking many tasteful women about theirs. You\u2019ll find everything here from Goop-coded Havaianas to dupes for the Row\u2019s $690 Dune flip-flops. (And if you\u2019re looking for more summer shoes to shop, check out our guides to the best espadrilles and flip-flops.)\nUpdate on August 14, 2025\nWe added a few new pairs, plus confirmed availability and updated prices for all others. Some styles from Camper, Keen, Aerosoles, and Vagabond are on sale.\nFlip-flops\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nFirst up: a slew of Havaianas. \u201cI might say they are the most Goop-coded Havaianas, but that would give the impression I shop at Goop,\u201d says artist Melly Wirtes. The Slim Crystal Flip Flops are the pair she slips into for walks around the block on the Upper East Side and vacations to South Carolina and Jamaica. It \u201cmay be laughable,\u201d but the Slim\u2019s little crystal turns them into something more than just a humble flip-flop, she told me. It helps that it \u201ckind of registers as a neutral on my skin tone (read: fair complexion perpetually slightly sunburned in summer)\u201d in ballet rose. (Meanwhile, she mentally earmarks Havaianas\u2019 Brazil \u2014 more on those further down \u2014 as \u201cswimming pool/beach/outdoor\u201d flip-flops.)\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nUnlike standard-issued Havaianas, these Havaianas are square-toed rather than round. It \u201cgives them that grown-woman feel,\u201d says journalist Devine Blacksher. Blacksher owns two pairs: one for indoors and the other for outdoors (say, running errands around the neighborhood or for pedicure appointments). \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t wear flip-flops across the city, but for local stuff, they make sense,\u201d she says.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nYou can often catch Catbird\u2019s chief creative officer, Leigh Plessner, about town in this pair of Havaianas flip-flops. Plessner takes them out of town, too \u2014 at the beach, she wears these with nightgowns or a housecoat over a swimsuit when the sun\u2019s out, and silk dresses after sunset. The logo \u2014 a flag of Brazil \u2014 is a little \u201csilly and winky\u201d when paired with her more formal outfits, she says.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThe Lilys from TKees are everything Ruby Buddemeyer, director of copy and concept at Starface, wants in a sandal: low-profile, not loud, easy to throw on. And while the sandals have a thin silhouette, there\u2019s some cushioning in the sole \u2014 and, importantly, no break-in time. \u201cI hate breaking in shoes. I tried Birkenstocks a handful of times and can\u2019t handle the break-in,\u201d says Buddemeyer. \u201cThese were comfortable right away.\u201d She\u2019s worn them for four summers in a row now.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThis new version of the Lily is similarly low-profile with a square-toe silhouette. It\u2019s the flip-flop that Strategist writer Brenley Goertzen went on a weeks-long search for. (Goertzen even returned some Havaianas in her hunt.) \u201cI\u2019ll admit the price tag is steep for flip-flops, but they feel so nice underfoot and the straps don\u2019t dig in,\u201d she told me. They arrived just a week ago, but she\u2019s already picturing wearing them by the pool.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThis summer, when Buddenmeyer isn\u2019t in her Tkees, she\u2019ll be in Reformation\u2019s Jessie Thong Sandal. \u201cThey\u2019re a bit heavy \u2014 not in a detrimental way, just in the sense that you need to get used to them,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially when I compare them to my Tkees, which are incredibly lightweight.\u201d Unlike her Tkees, they\u2019re made from suede (instead of leather). Like her Tkees, they come in a selection of colors, including avocado, espresso, and lipstick.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nIn lieu of the Row\u2019s $690 Dune flip-flops, stylist Lilli Millhiser went with $99 Island Slippers. \u201cConsidering all the stories of the jellies falling apart, I just couldn\u2019t justify the $700,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019re still $100, but that\u2019s way better than $700.\u201d She looked at Reef and Teva, but these were the simplest option (with some arch support), completely unadorned but for a tiny logo that you could cut off. Technically men\u2019s flip-flops, they\u2019re available in men\u2019s sizes 5 to 14 (or starting at around a women\u2019s size 7).\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThe Love List newsletter editor Jess Graves predicted \u201cjelly everything\u201d was going to be everywhere last year \u2014 and the trend\u2019s continued into this year. She traced the trend back to the Row\u2019s Fashion Week show when the buzzy Mara jelly flat was introduced. But word spread that jellies broke easily, including the pair Graves bought. Ancient Greek Sandals\u2019 Saionara looks similar to The Row\u2019s flip-flop, but for a fraction of the cost. The Saionaras feature see-through jelly straps on a hand-stitched leather sole. \u201cThey feel like a grown-up Old Navy flip-flop,\u201d Graves says.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nAncient Greek Sandals\u2019 jellies are still pretty pricey \u2014 though these much cheaper ones from the Gap are a pretty convincing dupe.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThe Kinto from A.Emery is square toed, thicker strapped, and has a slim silhouette. The sandals \u2014 which come in colors like lapis, walnut, and eggshell \u2014 are \u201cconsiderably comfortable,\u201d according to Joanna Fu, New York correspondent for Vogue Hong Kong, who adds that these are \u201cas dressed up as flip-flops can be.\u201d Her recommendation convinced me to get a pair (which I included in last year\u2019s June installment of our Strategist Haul series). They\u2019re almost forgettable \u2014 and I mean that in the most complimentary way. They remind me of vintage Jil Sander, and they truly go with everything, from sheer beach pants to cutoffs. (A fun tidbit: I\u2019m almost sure I caught Magasin\u2019s Laura Reilly in a pair on Instagram, too.) A. Emery also makes the Morgan, the equivalent of a suede version.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nA more substantial flip-flop is the Deia from Margaux, which Strategist senior editor Hilary Reid received recently. \u201cThe thick upper weave gives a little more coverage than your average flip-flop\u201d Reid says. \u201cThe style reminds me of a pair of hand-me-down sandals I had from my mom, which I think she bought in the \u201990s and I proceeded to wear to a pulp.\u201d She plans to pair these with linen pants and poplin skirts this summer.\nEditor\u2019s note: Some sizes are now sold out, but you can sign up to receive an email when your size is back in stock.\nFlats\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nStrategist senior editor Ailbhe Malone\u2019s first pair of Camper Orugas \u201clasted three summers of tough wear \u2014 from a wedding weekend in Toulouse to endless mind-numbingly long walks with a stroller and two weeks of traveling slowly east from Budapest to Northern Transylvania.\u201d Malone\u2019s now on her second pair (the same from the July edition of our monthly Strategist Haul series from 2023). \u201cLike Birkenstocks, they have a natural cork sole so they don\u2019t smell sweaty, but unlike Tevas, the outsole is a kind of platform made from EVA,\u201d she says. \u201cThe result is a supremely comfortable shoe that lasts a long time and leans heavily on the luxe end of sporty-luxe.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nWriter Alexis Cheung discovered the Montbell Lock-On Sandals (not to be confused with the Sock-On Sandals we\u2019ve written about before) last year on a trip to Boulder, or \u201cthe Mecca of outdoor gear.\u201d You could wear them for any active excursion, \u201calthough I\u2019d personally never hike in them,\u201d she says. Plus, they \u201cpack down into nothing,\u201d if you\u2019re backpacking.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\n\u201cIf I saw these online only, I\u2019m not sure I would\u2019ve ordered them,\u201d Reid says (she wasn\u2019t entirely convinced by all the hardware). Not until later when she passed someone wearing them in her neighborhood did Reid \u201cimmediately clock them as comfortable and really nice-looking,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are indeed just that \u2014 very comfortable (the sole is surprisingly cushy for sandals this flat).\u201d And the grommets add a little shine to her otherwise understated outfits.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nAbena Anim-Somuah, the food writer behind the Your Friend in Food substack, picked up the Ancient Greek Sandals\u2019 Alcyone on a trip to Greece some summers ago. She has packed them for nearly every vacation since, taking them from old European cities to the African countryside. \u201cSometimes, they\u2019ll be the only dressy shoes I pack for a summer vacation,\u201d she says. She only wishes tying them wasn\u2019t \u201ca wee bit cumbersome.\u201d Her friend jokingly nicknamed them her Mesopotamia 11s (they\u2019re Ancient Greek Sandals after all).\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nSimilarly, the Ancient Greek Sandals\u2019 Eleftheria have been a \u201cfaithful travel companion\u201d to Victoria Filippini, a content creator and writer of the newsletter Taking Notes. That has included going to cottages up north in Canada and through the south of France. \u201cThey\u2019ve been with me for both vacations without much walking and for heavy sightseeing trips in equal measure,\u201d she says. Even as someone whose feet swell in the heat, she hasn\u2019t ever gotten a blister from these. \u201cI\u2019ve worn them so much my toes are literally imprinted into the soles,\u201d Filippini tells me. Like the Alcyone (above), the Eleftheria can initially be tricky to put on. Eventually, they should stretch enough that you\u2019ll be able to just slide them right on as she does now.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nSimply cut with crossover straps and a toe post, Ancient Greek Sandals\u2019 Kansiz are \u201cbarely noticeable when worn yet immediately missed when switched out for another,\u201d says Tanya Gonzalez, co-founder of Eauso Vert. Gonzalez credits this to the \u201cthoughtful construction, as \u201csome sandals snag the back of heels and cause blisters. These don\u2019t and stay close to the foot so you don\u2019t have to worry about these slipping out of place.\u201d (They don\u2019t make \u201cthat annoying flip-flop sound,\u201d either.) She should know \u2014 one of her pairs survived a year of traveling from a bachelorette party in Greece to her sister-in-law\u2019s wedding in India. The other pair she danced in for hours at her wedding (which happened to be a four-day event).\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nNew!

Strategist senior writer Lauren Ro received her first Tevas when she was 10 years old. The Original Universals, which were created back in 1984 by a Grand Canyon river guide, are her \u201csuper-reliable \u2018adventure\u2019 sandals\u201d to this day. They\u2019re \u201cextremely crunchy-looking to me in the best way,\u201d she says. Or there\u2019s the slim version that Catbird founder Rony Vardi likes. \u201cI always turned my nose up at them. Too chunky, too crunchy, too ugly. But the thin straps spoke to me, and I really warmed up to ugly,\u201d she says. They were essential when recovering from a foot injury, quickly becoming her most-worn sandal last summer (packed for a trip to Rome and taken to the beach).\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nOn the other side of the Strategist\u2019s sandal debate: Chacos. It\u2019ll be another \u201cChacos summer\u201d for Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo. \u201cI wear my Chacos pretty much everywhere, especially if I am going to possibly encounter a playground sprinkler,\u201d says Corsillo. They were the only shoes she packed for a week in Southampton. Meanwhile, brand consultant Nancy Rosenbloom told me she lives in three sandals, including the same Chaco Z1s as Corsillo. \u201cThese are essential for summers in Vermont for when my hike turns into a swim and I get to feel like an amphibian,\u201d Rosenbloom says. They have a thicker sole that gives them \u201cbetter traction in the elements\u201d than Tevas.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nWhile it hasn\u2019t been long since Writes got Loeffler Randall\u2019s Laras (for a birthday in March), they don\u2019t have the \u201cprecariousness of sandal straps that feel like they\u2019re about to snap at any moment.\u201d In fact, she can move the metal ball between her big toe for more room. (Nary a blister yet, either.) \u201cHate to use the clich\u00e9 they can be dressed up or down, but they really can,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel kind of Row-Khaite-Tot\u00eame to me.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nReid was first turned on to Margaux\u2019s Flat style six years ago and has been wearing them every summer since. She told me the padded footbed prevents her from having \u201cdreaded hot heels\u201d on longer jaunts, and that she\u2019s worn them to walk all over the city, in addition to wearing them on trips to Jamaica and Italy: \u201cThey look right in just about every setting,\u201d Reid adds. And while her tan pair from six years ago is still in pretty good shape, she\u2019s considering buying a fresh pair of the same for this summer.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nIt\u2019s become an annual tradition for cookbook author and Devour newsletter writer Odette Williams to replace her pair of these simple, thin-strapped sandals each summer with exactly the same pair \u2014 she wears them that much. The design, with a strap around the ankles and another across the toes, endears them to her, as they\u2019re \u201cgreat day-to-night shoes.\u201d And though the brand\u2019s site notes that these sandals start out stiff, Williams assures that they take a day to break in, max.\nFishermans\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nWe\u2019re calling Keens\u2019 Newports as the new Teva Voya Infinity. Our senior writer Lauren Ro first noticed them in a post from Parisian store Rendez-Vous, \u201conly to realize that they\u2019re the adult version of the sandals my kids wear. Somehow, the monochrome, tactical look registered completely differently.\u201d They\u2019re the Strategist\u2019s sandal for this summer (a New York Times editor already ordered them off her recommendation in another Instagram Story), a designation previously held by Mary-Kate Olsen\u2019s Voya Infinity. \u201cThe Newports are, perhaps, a podiatric improvement on the Voya Infinities in that they provide more traction,\u201d Ro speculates.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThere\u2019s \u201csome witchy orthopedic magic happening\u201d with the Bloomer, Rosenbloom says. \u201cI\u2019ve walked ten miles in the city and never got a blister or a foot cramp.\u201d You\u2019re not clinging to the shoe with your toes like you would with a slide, either. It combines the fisherman with the flat-form for a sandal that\u2019s \u201cbuoyed by a protective sole,\u201d agrees Strategist writer Kitty Guo. Her feet feel more protected from \u201cglass, gum, and general street grime,\u201d too.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nElizabeth Cardinal Tamkin, author of the Corner Booth newsletter and content director at Kule, doesn\u2019t like to show her toes all that often. Still, K.Jacques\u2019 Adrien are \u201ckind of like the loafer of sandals, if you will,\u201d keeping her feet covered for the most part. So far, they\u2019ve been in her sandal rotation for three years. \u201cThe only reason why I wouldn\u2019t wear them is because I sometimes end up wearing them too much,\u201d she tells me. But the more worn they get, the better. (And a K.Jacques customer for over 20 years, creative consultant Joyce Lee just bought the Anaelle. It\u2019ll be her fifth or sixth pair: \u201cI keep them forever because the sole and footbed last and wear in so nicely.\u201d)\nEditor\u2019s note: The company lists its prices in euros, so this is an approximation to dollars.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nIt\u2019s going to be the third summer our writer Katherine Gillespie gets around with a pair of Plasticanas. \u201cI find them more comfortable than a jelly style should be,\u201d she says. They\u2019re made from a sturdy hemp plastic, which, according to Gillespie, qualifies them as \u201cobviously great for the beach, especially if you find yourself on a rocky European beach\u201d where going barefoot isn\u2019t recommended. But even on a Greenpoint sidewalk, they\u2019re better than a flip-flop. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprisingly practical summer city shoe,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThey\u2019re waterproof. They\u2019re grippy. They have a closed toe box.\u201d And while Gillespie suffers from getting blisters easily, she could wear these right out of the box (after taking the advice of a Salter House sales associate and going up a size). They\u2019re more comfortable than Filippini expected them to be. \u201cI think that\u2019s to do with their being a hemp rubber instead of traditional plastic,\u201d she says. On a recent weekend in Niagara, \u201cthey were the perfect shoe for farmers-market trips, wine tastings, caf\u00e9 runs, and lounging poolside,\u201d she says. They\u2019ve been her \u201cgo-to summer shoes\u201d since last year.\nEditor\u2019s note: Most sizes are now sold out, but you can sign up to receive an email when your size is back in stock at each retailer below.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nEmilia Petrarca, author of the newsletter Shop Rat, swears by Hereu\u2019s Pescas, which are \u201cthe sturdiest, most comfortable sandals\u201d she has. The shoes take her far and are what Petrarca wears while walking around on trips. \u201cI\u2019m sure I saw other people wearing them, but what sealed the deal for me was how soft the leather was,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can just tell they\u2019re super well made.\u201d These can be styled in endless ways, too \u2014 including with socks (as she did while walking all around Naples last fall). \u201cThey\u2019re a little \u2018dorkier,\u2019 I would say, but that\u2019s what I like about them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re thicker and chunkier, but I think they can be girlie.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: The company lists prices in euros, so this is an approximation to U.S. dollars.\nSlides\nNew!

They carry that essence,\u201d says Hannah Baxter, beauty director at Marie Claire. Coming Soon co-founder Fabiana Faria thinks how your foot imprints onto them makes them more yours. Golde\u2019s Trinity Mouzon Wofford grew up with them in upstate New York \u2014 Mouzon Wofford\u2019s mom wore them for as long as she can remember \u2014 and they\u2019re now the ones she wears while living in Brooklyn. Almost a decade later, after moving to the Hudson Valley, they\u2019re her gardening shoes. She says, \u201cThey don\u2019t feel beachy (I\u2019m not beachy), but they still invite the feeling of summer.\u201d Anim-Somuah thinks they\u2019re \u201cthe ultimate accessory to let everyone know that you aspire to be a Park Slope mom.\u201d She gets a pair of Arizonas every other year and retires the older pair to use as house shoes.) Bathen co-founder Hannah Zisman says she could get away with them \u2014 in a high-shine finish, at least \u2014 for a wedding in Maine, the Hamptons, and Whistler.\nNew!

It\u2019s the sandal of choice for self-professed \u201cbig Birkenstock person,\u201d Pia Velasco, a generative AI specialist. \u201cI spend as much time as I can by the water, and these are just really easy to wash the sand, dirt, and mud off,\u201d Velasco says.\nNew!

Over the years, they\u2019ve been everything from Muay Thai training slides in Thailand to Los Angeles beachwear.\nNew!

Ferrara first found the Crocs for a photo shoot and then decided to wear them herself. They\u2019re easy to hose down. \u201cNew York City in the summer is so yucky, but there are all these hydrants that are open so I just put my feet in them,\u201d she says. They\u2019ve even been confused for the Row and a Givenchy knockoff.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThe first friend in brand consultant Nancy Rosenbloom\u2019s circle to own a pair of Beatrice Valenzuela\u2019s Sandalias was Herman Miller creative director Kelsey Keith. Keith has them in teal, while Rosenbloom goes to Rhoan for the store\u2019s rainbow of colors (amethyst, rum, shell). \u201cAny color goes with any outfit, somehow,\u201d she says.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nLast summer, Catbird founder Rony Vardi relied on this pair of slides called the Colbie (which have been reissued this summer with a more molded footbed) for the transition time between spring and summer. They\u2019re not as comfortable as Birkenstocks, but \u201cthe cute-to-comfortable ratio is favorable.\u201d It\u2019s the thin straps that make them look more expensive, too \u2014 Vardi thinks they could easily be mistaken for \u201ca cool Japanese brand\u201d instead of preppy J.Crew.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThese sandals are what Zisman takes on tropical vacations \u2014 they\u2019ve seen Tulum and Palm Springs already, with Maui next on the list. \u201cThey\u2019re like elevated Tevas but still comfortable,\u201d she says. The bandanna print is surprisingly versatile and adds some punch to the colorful linen dresses and matching short sets Zisman packs.\nEditor\u2019s note: Zisman\u2019s Framboise Bandana version is currently sold out, so we\u2019ve linked to another colorway.\nNew!

You can now save this product for later.\nOriginally from Hawaii, Cheung grew up wearing \u201cJesus sandals,\u201d or Jandals as they\u2019re properly called. \u201cThey\u2019re great for beach days, because they\u2019re waterproof, and for traveling, because they flatten into nothing,\u201d she says. And while they don\u2019t have a ton of arch support, Cheung says her feet have never hurt even \u201cafter pounding the pavement\u201d in them. Also appealing: the low price (if you\u2019re in Hawaii, you can find them at ABC convenience stores). \u201cIf they break down, you don\u2019t feel bad about rebuying,\u201d Cheung explains. \u201cBut I have friends whose pairs are ancient.\u201d\nNew!

The silhouettes are \u201cbeautifully minimalist,\u201d with touches like toe rings to make them interesting, says Petrarca. The Bari is an updated version of the brand\u2019s best-selling Susan, with corded lines of leather that cross the foot. Just take note: The sandals are \u201cnot blisterproof. Not really meant for walking long distances,\u201d she cautions. \u201cBut they feel worth it.\u201d More recently, Petrarca bought the pool slide version of the Bari. \u201cThey\u2019re more affordable, and therefore I feel less precious about them,\u201d she says. \u201cI threw them in my suitcase (along with my other Baris) for a recent trip to Jamaica. I think they\u2019re just as chic.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nReid got these sandals last summer, and the slides were comfortable to wear straight out of the box with no blisters even after the first few wears. Notably, they have a surprisingly cushy footbed and somewhat of an Herm\u00e8s Oran air (without looking like a blatant knockoff).\nEditor\u2019s note: Some sizes are now sold out, but you can sign up to receive an email when your size is back in stock.\nPlatforms\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\n\u201cThe idea of wearing sandals on the sidewalk or the subway and having my bare toes exposed to God knows what is horrifying,\u201d says brand consultant Katie Stone. \u201cBut sometimes sandals are necessary, especially when it\u2019s 90-plus degrees out and the thought of putting on socks is unimaginable.\u201d The compromise is this Teva, which she doesn\u2019t have to be precious about. The height (higher than that on the original) means there\u2019s \u201cenough to separate my bare feet from the disgustingness of the street.\u201d Not only that, they\u2019re \u201cquite cushiony without looking geriatric (no offense).\u201d Something about the extra inch also gives her license to \u201cwear them in slightly more formal settings (dinners, happy hours) where regular Tevas would not be appropriate.\u201d It\u2019ll be the third summer she spends in them.\n(For \u201cbasically fancy Japanese Tevas,\u201d Abel Objects\u2019 Kelsey Lim recommends the Suicoke Depa-V2PO. \u201cI have lived in New York City too long to want my exposed feet too close to the ground,\u201d she says. These help her feel safe. But don\u2019t dillydally, as stock is selling fast.)\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nNew!

You can now save this product for later.\nThere might be horror stories about breaking in pairs of Dr. Martens, but the Nartillas shouldn\u2019t make the back of your foot bleed. \u201cThey have a bouncy sole that feels totally different from a Dr. Martens boot. It isn\u2019t stiff at all. It\u2019s more like a Hoka sole,\u201d says podcast producer Mbiye Kasonga. For four summers in a row, Kasonga\u2019s worn them for days when she ends up racking up 10,000 steps. Because of the laces, they\u2019re not the easiest to take on and off. This could \u201cbe the only con of the shoe, but in my mind that\u2019s also a pro,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to slide around like I might be in a Birkenstock.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nYou might never guess these wedges are from Crocs \u2014 a big selling point for Strategist junior writer Bella Druckman, who was searching for a pair that could stand up to the city streets while still looking put-together. The shoes are especially easy to clean: \u201cEven if they get dirty, they won\u2019t stay that way for long,\u201d Druckman says. The platform on them also gives her a few inches without making them difficult to walk in the slightest.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nStrategist senior editor Winnie Yang has logged miles with these Keens while hiking, restaurant-hopping in the Hamptons, and traversing concrete and cobblestoned streets across cities. The secure straps and gripped soles made them supportive and comfortable right from the beginning. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to get on and off, and they have a little height to them, which gives my feet (or maybe just my mind) that critical distance from grimy sidewalks and subway floors,\u201d Yang says. The sandals also don\u2019t call attention to themselves \u2014 a fact she appreciates, as she\u2019s not one to get a pedicure.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nReid\u2019s hunt for \u201cgood walking sandals that aren\u2019t hideous\u201d turned up this Vince pair that a friend of hers even compared to Lemaire. Though the soles are \u201cpretty heavy,\u201d the sandals feel exceptionally sturdy and have a heel-soothing cushioned sole. Like Reid, Buddenmeyer found the footbed soft, with the sandals super-comfortable immediately. Buddenmeyer suggests they run a bit big (she went with a 7 instead of her usual 7.5 ).\nWedges and heels\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nIf you\u2019re a \u201c\u201990s-era Calvin Klein\u2013loving someone who\u2019s aged out of punishing heels,\u201d try Hopp\u2019s Limbo Slide, says Monica Khemsurov, co-founder of Sight Unseen and founder of Petra. (They\u2019re seemingly inspired by those cut-out wedges, she adds.) Unlike her other ugly-cool thrifted sandals, these haven\u2019t fallen apart after a little over a year of traipsing around the Lower East Side and beyond. She notes, \u201cThere\u2019s the potential to wobble if your foot hits the ground the wrong way.\u201d That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re dangerous, as they\u2019re \u201cmore comfortable than your average heel, and you still get some of that height.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nA recent find for writer Jo Rosenthal is this thong-strap wedge that \u201cgives a stepmom-in-Florida-who-drinks-Chardonnay-at-lunch energy, and I mean that in the best way. They work perfectly for strutting around the city like I\u2019m about to cut the line everywhere I go passive-aggressively.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nReid ordered the Evelyn from Tuckernuck early this summer because \u201celegant, strappy, low-heeled sandals that are not a bazillion dollars can be hard to come by.\u201d So far, she has been pleased. \u201cThe top strap falls at a very flattering place on the foot and doesn\u2019t cut off my leg in a stumpy way (which some ankle straps can),\u201d she says. Importantly, they break in pretty quickly (though there was some rubbing on the first wear).\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nChloe Weitman, founder of Yeah It\u2019s Jewelry, wears these \u201990s-style Steve Madden platforms when it\u2019s too hot in Los Angeles to think about putting on socks. They\u2019re nostalgic, though more comfortable than the pair you had in high school, thanks to the very stretchy upper.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nThe ubiquitousness of Maryam Nassir Zadeh\u2019s Olympia wedges put Ro off them originally. Until she couldn\u2019t resist anymore (which coincided with them going on sale). Now she knows why every woman on the Lower East Side wanted a pair. \u201cThey\u2019re sexy. They\u2019re comfortable. They go with every warm-weather outfit imaginable.\u201d On a vacation to St. Kitts back in March, they went as well with white paper-bag shorts as they did with a LBD. \u201cI was worried about the vinyl straps getting sweaty or digging into my feet, but I barely noticed them,\u201d she says.\nNew!

From the wedding reception to the ceremony \u2014 from approximately 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. \u2014 she almost forgot about them while dancing. (Despite her intention to put on some Schultz flats.) Years later, they\u2019ve become her special-occasion sandals, specifically for any event \u201cthat might involve being outside for an extended period of time on gravel, grass, or uneven surfaces\u201d (including a Food & Wine Best New Chefs party). Because they\u2019re white (wedding-appropriate and not impossible to ever wear again), they might get dirty. Not in a \u201cthese are unwearable\u201d way, though (\u201cthe fabric didn\u2019t fray or tear after taking photos in the woods or hanging out by a firepit\u201d she says).\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nDr. Scholl\u2019s sandals had a moment last year when Sarah Jessica Parker wore them while filming And Just Like That \u2026 But they outdate the buzz \u2014 in fact, they\u2019ve been around since 1959. \u201cThey were originally coined the \u2018exercise\u2019 sandal for a reason. The design of the shoe really puts your calves to work,\u201d says Shelby Ying Hyde, a writer who has contributed to the Cut, Vogue, and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, and who notes her legs got a workout in these when she took them on a trip to Miami for Swim Week and brought them poolside in Los Cabos.\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\nStrategist writer Tembe Denton-Hurst tipped creative strategist Carrie Carrollo off to Camper\u2019s Twin sandals. Carrollo was intrigued by their \u201ccontrasting silhouettes \u2014 each a different organic shape (sisters, not twins, contrary to the name),\u201d she says. It didn\u2019t hurt that they had the \u201clowest of block heels\u201d for a little lift. They\u2019re easy to move in, too, according to Carollo: \u201cI have almost wide, almost flat feet and find some shoes with this type of construction too narrow, but these are perfect.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\n\u201cIt was a totally unplanned purchase, I had 30 minutes to kill in Soho during which time I actually walked into the Camper store and left with these on my feet,\u201d Wall Street Journal art editor Alexandra Citrin-Safadi says. They reminded her of the MNZ Tupelos she \u201cthrashed beyond salvation.\u201d Beyond a cost-effective replacement, they\u2019re easy. \u201cIt took me one day to get used to them (any shoe with a toe split requires a 24-hour adjustment period).\u201d Unless it was raining in the last few weeks, she pretty much hasn\u2019t taken them off. \u201cThey\u2019re great for more casual knock-around activities, ideally with a peasant-y cotton skirt and a big vintage T-shirt thrown on top. I can already tell this will be my playground mom look through Labor Day.\u201d\nNew! You can now save this product for later.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a few years since I found a strappy sandal that\u2019s this flexible (stylistically) and not vintage (RIP to when you could get gently used Manolos for under $100 on the RealReal),\u201d Citrin-Safadi tells me. These are among the cheapest here, at under $150. Citrin-Safadi was \u201cpleasantly surprised by the quality\u201d initially, especially since another pair of Vagabonds she owned broke while she was walking down Calyer Street a decade ago. Even more so now. \u201cThis being my second consecutive summer with these sandals is notable, as I usually destroy sandals after one season, a testament to their quality,\u201d she says.\nNew!
