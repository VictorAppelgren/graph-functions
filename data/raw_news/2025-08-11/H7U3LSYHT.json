  "content": "US stock futures wavered around the flatline as Wall Street braced for July's inflation report and President Trump revealed his pick to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFutures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the benchmark S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) held steady.\n\nAfter the bell on Monday, Trump announced that he nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the BLS.\n\n\"E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,\" the president said on Truth Social.\n\nTrump fired Erika McEntarfer as commissioner of the BLS earlier this month following the release of the July jobs report, which contained \"larger than normal\" revisions to data and revealed fewer jobs than previously thought had been added to the economy. Trump said, without providing evidence, that McEntarfer had been acting politically and her numbers \"were wrong.\"\n\nTrump also met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan Monday evening, which boosted its stock in after-hours trading. Last week, the president called for Tan to resign, but after Monday's meeting he indicated his cabinet would continue discussions with the CEO, without specifying the topics under consideration.\n\nDuring day trading, stocks slumped even as Trump granted another 90-day pause on the most punishing tariffs on China as the two countries work toward a trade deal.\n\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\n\nWall Street is preparing for the release of July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Tuesday morning. Analysts expect it to show that prices increased as Trump's tariffs kicked in. A hot inflation report could put the Federal Reserve in a tight spot as it navigates rising prices amid recent signs of a weakening labor market. In the background, anticipation over the possibility of a September interest rate cut continues to grow.\n\nInvestors will get two more pulse checks on the state of the economy later this week, with the release of the Producer Price Index on Thursday and retail sales data on Friday.",

      "text": "In This Article:\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order implementing another 90-day pause on additional tariffs on China that were set to take effect on Tuesday. The move again pushes off a deadline for imposing the harshest taxes on Chinese imports as the two sides continue negotiations on a deal.\nTrump posted on social media that he had signed the order around 8 p.m. ET. Around the same time, China also announced the extension of the tariff pause via official news agency Xinhua.\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\nThe extension means headline rates agreed to in May of 30% on Chinese imports and 10% on American goods will continue for the immediate future \u2014 until a new deadline on November 10 \u2014 and avoid a snap-back to previous triple-digit levels. Sector-specific tariffs on goods like steel and some medical supplies will keep the effective tariff rate between the two countries higher.\nThe extension also comes amid an increased focus from Trump in recent days on Russia and the war in Ukraine, with Trump putting an additional 25% tariff on imports from India over that nation\u2019s consumption of Russian oil.\nThe new pause could also increase the odds for a meeting later this year between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. The two men\u2019s teams have both floated the concept of a face-to-face meeting, perhaps as soon as the coming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea at the end of October.\nMonday's announcement also came after three meetings of the two trade teams in recent months \u2014 gatherings that took place in Geneva in May, London in June, and Stockholm in July \u2014 resulted in signs of progress, though tensions remain between the two sides.\nHe Lifeng, China's vice premier for economic policy, has represented his country at all three meetings. A representative for He \u2014 Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang \u2014 said after the most recent round in Sweden that the two sides had \u201ccandid exchanges over their economic concerns,\u201d according to a translation.\nCertain issues like semiconductors, including a plan to allow the resumption of Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chip exports to China, as well as Chinese exports of rare earth minerals, have been the focus of the talks so far, with a long list of issues between the two nations still to be discussed.\nOver the weekend, the Trump administration struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD to allow those chipmakers to sell some chips into the Chinese market in exchange for a 15% cut of the sales.\nClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

      "text": "President Trump said in a social media post Friday afternoon that he directed members of his administration to fire Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the BLS on Friday published a July jobs report that contained what it called \"larger than normal\" revisions to data from May and June.\nThe July jobs report published Friday morning showed the US economy added 73,000 jobs last month, fewer than expected, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%.\nThe most notable numbers to emerge from the report, however, were downward revisions to job gains in May and June, which saw 258,000 jobs taken away from what had been initially reported.\nMay's job gains were revised down to 19,000 from 144,000, while June's additions were cut to just 14,000 from the 147,000 initially reported.\nLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer appeared to confirm McEntarfer's firing in a post on X, saying Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski would serve as interim head of the BLS. McEntarfer was confirmed as BLS commissioner by an 86-8 Senate vote back in January.\nIn its release on Friday, the BLS said these revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"\nAs he left the White House for the weekend later Friday, President Trump repeated his charges, without providing evidence, that McEntarfer was acting politically and that her \"numbers were wrong.\"\nHe added that he would begin reviewing candidates for her permanent replacement soon and that he has three people in particular in mind without revealing their names.\nHe responded to the question of whether the candidates he is focused on have labor statistics experience by saying, \"I'll put someone in who's going to be honest.\"\nEconomists, meanwhile, on Friday were near-unanimous in their view that July's jobs data and the revisions to May and June reflect a labor market that is far weaker than had been suggested by recent data and characterizations by some officials, notably Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\"The 'solid' state of the labor market described by the FOMC earlier this week looks more questionable after the July employment report,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note Friday.\nJob gains over the last three months have now averaged just 35,000 after Friday's revisions.\nIn his post on Friday, Trump accused McEntarfer and the BLS of reporting \"faked\" jobs numbers in the run-up to last year's election, and noted February's benchmark revision to 2024 jobs data that showed payroll growth last year was overstated by some 818,000 jobs."

      "text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n-\nThe Chart of the Day\n-\nWhat we're watching\n-\nWhat we're reading\n-\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nNobody really knows what the future will bring, but Wall Street likes to have a good idea, especially when it comes to the Federal Reserve's next move.\nWhat might have been a likely outcome for the central bank to cut rates in September now seems closer to a toss-up, based on the way the market is reacting to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's latest remarks.\nAt the end of the Fed's policy meeting on Wednesday, Powell didn't explicitly say the next move would be a cut, and reiterated that it's still early days in understanding how tariffs will impact inflation.\n(Markets flashed red following Powell's commentary, and the CME FedWatch tool showed the likelihood of a cut in September dropped from 65% on Tuesday to 45% at the end of the meeting.)\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\nFed policymakers don't make rate decisions ahead of time, so Powell's response is typical. But a quirk in the Fed's calendar raises the stakes for the September meeting. As Morgan Stanley's chief US economist Michael Gapen has observed, the gap between the Fed's July and September huddles is the longest in the Fed's annual schedule.\nA lot can happen between now and then.\n\"A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level, but it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,\" Powell said during the press conference Wednesday.\nWe do have some level of certainty, however. Powell indicated that, to some extent, the Fed has already chosen to look through the inflationary effect of tariffs as a one-time event. The Fed, he reminded everyone in a not-so-comforting way, could have raised rates to counteract the pricing pressures of the new levies. But he and most of his colleagues think it best to wait for now.\nHowever, a long enough wait can result in a different outlook. As Powell himself acknowledged, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at a lot of data in the next cycle. It is one of the cycles where we have two employment and two inflation reports, and we\u2019ll see where that takes us.\u201d As the timeline stretches out, uncertainty can expand.\nOf the data ahead, Powell noted that he's especially keeping his eye on the unemployment rate, as both supply and demand for jobs have declined \u2014 deprioritizing the headline monthly job gains. But if the unemployment rate starts to rise, that's a good indicator that the central bank has kept up its slightly restrictive posture for too long. But he also suggested the fight to curb inflation \"is most of the way back.\" We already have two dissenters on the rate-setting committee who believe the Fed should already be cutting."

Trump, President of the United States of America: Gold will not be Tariffed!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday afternoon.\nOn Friday, the Financial Times reported that CBP classified Swiss one-kilogram and 100-ounce bars of gold as subject to 39% tariffs recently imposed on Switzerland by the Trump administration.\nGold futures (GC=F) declined 2.5% early on Monday as investors awaited clarity from the White House over its trade position on the precious metal amid reports that imports of Swiss gold bars would not be exempt from tariffs.\nSmall US firms paying Trump tariffs face $202B annual hit\nSmall US businesses are struggling to comply with President Trump's new tariffs.

Overall, the US accounts for 17% of Switzerland's watch exports. As of April, goods from the country faced a much lower 10% tariff rate.\nPresident Trump has said he loves farmers, but his policies are starting to ripple across the agriculture industry.

The report, due Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes as investors stay alert to how much President Trump\u2019s tariffs are starting to affect consumer costs.\nAccording to Bloomberg data, headline CPI is expected to have increased 2.8% year over year in July, up from a 2.7% rise in June. On a monthly basis, prices are forecast to increase 0.2%, a slight slowdown from June\u2019s 0.3% gain, driven by lower gasoline prices and expectations of moderately softer food inflation.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, the annual inflation rate for July is expected to tick up to 3.0% from June\u2019s 2.9%, indicating that rising goods inflation is no longer being offset by easing services inflation.\nCore prices are also projected to climb 0.3% month over month, outpacing the previous 0.2% rise seen in June and marking the strongest gain in six months.\nIn June, signs of tariff-driven cost pressures emerged, with apparel prices up 0.4% on a monthly basis and footwear rising 0.7% after several months of declines. Furniture and bedding prices also gained 0.4%, reversing May\u2019s 0.8% drop, another signal that these higher costs are starting to reach consumers.\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\"The July CPI will bring further signs of higher tariffs pushing up prices,\" Wells Fargo economist Sarah House wrote last week. \"It is still early in the price adjustment process to see how higher import taxes will ultimately be distributed between the end-customer, domestic sellers and foreign exporters.\"\n\"At the same time, growing consumer fatigue is making it more difficult to raise prices in general,\" House added. \"We continue to expect inflation to pick up, but not ratchet higher, over the second half of the year, with both the core CPI and core PCE deflator returning to around 3% in the fourth quarter.\"\nTuesday's report is set to arrive amid ongoing trade developments that could further alter the US effective tariff rate, now hovering near 18.6% \u2014 the highest since 1933, according to the latest Yale Budget Lab estimate.\nStill, markets are increasingly betting the central bank will lower interest rates at its September meeting, driven largely by concerns over the US labor market\u2019s health after significant downward revisions, alongside persistent inflation.\n\"CPI could leave [the] Fed with dual headaches,\" Citi analyst Stuart Kaiser wrote in a preview of the report, adding investors will likely focus on updates to core goods prices."

      "text": "Wall Street strategists are sharply recalibrating their economic outlooks after Friday's July jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring and staggering downward revisions to prior months' data, suggesting the labor market may be losing steam at a quicker pace than previously thought.\nThe US economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below the 104,000 expected by economists. But the bigger surprise came from revisions to the May and June figures, which collectively erased 258,000 jobs. This marked the largest two-month downward revision since May 2020.\nSarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, called the July jobs report \"a dud\" in a client note titled \"July and the No Good, Very Bad Jobs Report.\"\n\"The 'solid' state of the labor market described by the FOMC earlier this week looks more questionable after the July employment report,\" she said, citing broad-based hiring weakness in cyclically sensitive sectors like manufacturing, retail, and professional services.\nDespite persistent strength in healthcare hiring, she added, \"the pace [of job growth] has lurched lower to just 35K\" over the past three months when factoring in revisions.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, bluntly told Yahoo Finance that the July numbers were simply \"not good. There's no way to sugarcoat that. The two-month revision is just staggering. It basically wipes out two months of what we thought were healthy job gains.\"\nCiti economist Veronica Clark agreed, telling Yahoo Finance, \"It's not so much this July number, but the massive downward revisions to the June number that we had last month. ... This definitely does look like a labor market that is weakening.\"\nMeanwhile, Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, called the report a \"gamechanger\" in a post on X, echoing others in saying \"the labor market now looks a lot weaker than expected.\"\nThe unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% in July, in line with expectations and still near historic lows. But as Clark pointed out, \"that happened despite the labor force participation rate falling more,\" a shift some economists have linked to President Trump's immigration crackdown.\nAhead of the report, there were growing concerns that increased deportations were reducing labor supply and keeping the jobless rate artificially low.\nSeptember rate cut odds surge\nThe revised data has added urgency to calls for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, with market pricing shifting notably in the aftermath.\n\"We still anticipate that the Fed starts to cut in September with consecutive cuts thereafter leading to about 100 basis points of cuts in total,\" said Leslie Falcone, head of taxable fixed income strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nFalcone noted that while the Fed had already turned more cautious, the scale of the revisions surprised even the most dovish forecasters. \"Some of these revisions are much more than what people expected. ... I do think that this is a bit on the weaker side. And it does put cuts back on the table.\"\nTraders seem to agree. Following the report, the probability of a September rate cut surged to about 80%, up from just 38% the day prior, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nEarlier this week, Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller broke from the majority of FOMC officials, dissenting against the decision to hold interest rates steady after warning that the labor market was weaker than initial data had indicated.\nThat warning appeared prescient on Friday as markets tumbled following the report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell over 2% by midmorning, the Dow (DOW) shed nearly 600 points, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 1.6%. Meanwhile, bond prices surged on increased rate cut bets, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) down 11 basis points to around 4.2%.\nAdding to labor market concerns, escalating trade tensions were also top of mind for investors as Trump hiked tariff rates on several US trading partners, including a surprise 39% tariff on Switzerland.\n\"The market had sort of put tariffs in the rearview mirror and assumed that the labor market was okay,\" Sosnick said. \"Well, both of those assumptions have been overturned quite dramatically this morning.\"\nThe strategist warned markets appear to be entering a \"reckoning period,\" explaining, \"We're not seeing a lot of reflexive dip buying. ... That, to me, tells me that the psychology, at least as of this particular moment, is a bit more tenuous than it was.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled Steve Sosnick's name.

      "text": "Intel stock jumps after Trump calls meeting with CEO Lip-Bu Tan 'interesting,' signals more talks ahead\nIn This Article:\nIntel (INTC) stock jumped Monday as CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with President Trump, who had called for Tan's resignation last week.\nAfter the meeting, Trump posted to Truth Social saying that he had met with Tan along with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. \"The meeting was a very interesting one,\" the president wrote, adding, \"His success and rise is an amazing story.\"\nTrump said Tan and his Cabinet will \"spend time together\" and \"bring suggestions\" to him in the next week, without specifying the topics to be discussed.\nIntel also released a statement acknowledging the two met and saying they had \"a candid and constructive discussion on Intel\u2019s commitment to strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\"\nIntel stock rose 3.5% on Monday during the day as reports circulated about the meeting. After Trump's post landed Monday evening, Intel continued to rise about 2.8% in after-hours trading.\nCiting unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Tan was set to meet with Trump on Monday to explain his personal and professional background and to propose ways that Intel and the government can collaborate.\nLast week, Trump called for Tan's resignation in a Truth Social post minutes after Fox Business covered Republican Sen. Tom Cotton's recent criticism of the CEO over his ties with China. In a letter to Intel, Cotton expressed \"concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations,\" given Tan\u2019s investments in Chinese businesses through his venture capital firm, Walden International.\nTrump wrote in his post last Thursday, \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.\u201d\nTan responded by saying reports about his career contained \"misinformation.\"\n\"There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles ... I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I\u2019ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem \u2014 and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,\" Tan wrote in a memo to employees.\nIntel also issued its own statement following Trump's comments, emphasizing its commitment to \"advancing US national and economic security interests\" and to making investments \"aligned with the President's America First agenda,\" including domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\nTan was named Intel's CEO in March, taking over after his predecessor Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the board last year. The company struggled to stem losses in its manufacturing business, regain market share in its legacy computer chip segment, and develop an AI strategy."

Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer. Trump also extended a 90-day pause on tariffs against China while meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, which positively impacted Intel's stock. The upcoming Consumer Price Index report is expected to show rising prices due to tariffs, raising concerns about the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts amid signs of a weakening labor market.",
