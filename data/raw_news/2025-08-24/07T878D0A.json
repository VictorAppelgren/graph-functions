This copy may not be in its final form, may be updated and may contain minor transcription errors. For previous show transcripts, visit the \"This Week\" transcript archive.\n\nKARL: I'm joined now by former CIA director and CENTCOM commander, General David Petraeus.\n\nGeneral Petraeus, thank you for joining us this morning. Let me start with that lookback. What -- what do you think? Do you think there will be another Putin-Zelenskyy meeting? And is there any reason to think it would be more successful than that one?\n\nGEN. DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: There's not that much right now that would lead us to believe that, I don't think. In fact, out of the last two weeks, really, Jonathan, I think what should be clear to all, and I think it is even clear to President Trump, is that despite all of his efforts, again which we applaud, to end the war, to stop the killing, Vladimir Putin clearly has no intention of doing that unless he's given additional territory, which is heavily fortified and Russian forces would have to fight for years at the pace that they're going.\n\nHe wants to displace President Zelenskyy, replace him with a pro-Russian figure, and frankly, to demilitarize Ukraine. None of which can be acceptable to Ukraine nor to the European countries and the United States. In fact, by the way, President Zelenskyy, under the Ukrainian constitution, doesn't even have the authority to declare that certain territory would be controlled by the Russians. That would have to go to a national referendum.\n\nSo, again, I think it should be clear. The obstacle to peace at this point in time is President Putin. And what we need to do is change those dynamics by helping Ukraine far more than we have so far, lifting restrictions on them, seizing the $300 billion of frozen reserve in European countries of Russian money, giving it to Ukraine, more sanctions on Russia, even including the Gazprom Bank and curtailing the export of oil further than we have already.\n\nKARL: Let me get to something else that President Trump said this week. This is a post on social media. He wrote, in part, \"It is very hard if not impossible to win a war without attacking an invader's country. It's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defensebut is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning. It\u2019s like that with Ukraine and Russia.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that it was Biden that wouldn't let Zelenskyy -- wouldn't let Ukraine attack into Russia.\n\nWhat -- first of all, what's your take on what the president was intending to say there?\n\nPETRAEUS: It's a very valid observation. It's spot on.\n\nAnd interestingly, as we learned in a story overnight, it's contrary to the Pentagon policy. This is another case where it appears that the Pentagon is carrying out policies that conflict with President Trump's inclination.\n\nNow, I can understand why they would limit the use of certain long-range systems against Russia when they think that Russia might still be willing to make a deal, but that should be very clear not to be the case at this moment, and I hope that there will be a review of that policy.\n\nIndeed, that was exactly what the Biden administration did in the past. They were overly sensitive endlessly about how Russia might react to something that they provide to Ukraine, and they were restricting the use of the army tactical missile system and others.\n\nAnd so, I hope that that will get a review in the White House and therefore a change in the Pentagon.\n\nKARL: Yeah, this is a \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d report overnight you're referring to saying that the Pentagon has been blocking Ukraine's use of those long-range missiles inside Russian territory. Obviously, the Ukrainian military has been using drone attacks which are far less lethal.\n\nBut let me -- let me get your sense of the human cost of this war because I know this is something you've spoken about, and I find astounding. You know, upwards of 20,000, just on the Russian side, getting killed every month. In the matter of just a few months, a greater death toll than the entire U.S. death toll in the Vietnam War. I mean, it's kind of hard to imagine.\n\nPETRAEUS: It's staggering, Jonathan. Again, as someone who had five combat commands as a general officer and wrote letters of condolence to America's mothers and fathers almost every single night of those commands, I can't fathom -- I can't process, if you will, understand the magnitude of the losses on the Russian side.\n\nIt's now estimated that over 1,060,000 Russians have been killed or wounded in this war. And of those, well over 500,000 have been so seriously wounded or killed that they couldn't even return to the front lines.\n\nThis has to have over time a very, very substantial impact on the ability of Russia just to find a civilian workforce as well. In fact, it's reported that they are actually looking in Africa for women who can actually replace some of the men in Russia in various industries.\n\nKARL: And of course, we've seen they've also tapped North Korean military soldiers --\n\nKARL: -- fighting on the ground in Ukraine. Quite extraordinary.\n\nBefore you go, I want to get your reaction to another development on Friday, the firing of the Defense Intelligence Agency chief, Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, after he oversaw the initial assessment on the Iran nuclear strike. What -- what do you -- what do you make of the president or the administration firing the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, you know, apparently because they didn't like an intelligence assessment?\n\nPETRAEUS: Yeah, I don't know the details of this particular case, Jonathan. As you mentioned, it just took place at the end of this week.\n\nThere's a maxim in the intelligence community always about speaking truth to power. I think that that's what this administration, any administration should always ask of its intelligence analysts and indeed its senior intelligence leaders.\n\nKARL: And very quickly, we'd also just shown on the screen, there are 16 general officers that have been either fired or reassigned since Trump became president.\n\nAnd obviously, the seven of them, which we talked about earlier, are women. What -- what do you make of this? It seems like a -- it's been called a purge in the ranks. What -- is this a concern?\n\nPETRAEUS: I think it has to be a concern. Obviously, it's unprecedented. There's never been anything like this.\n\nThere have been cases in the past where individuals who've gotten crosswise with the president or with the secretary of defense certainly, usually on a policy issue in which they should not have spoken out and indeed were replaced.\n\nBut the numbers here obviously are much more significant than that.\n\nKARL: All right. General David Petraeus, thank you very much. Always good to talk to you. Appreciate your time.",

      "text": "Supreme Court formally asked to overturn landmark same-sex marriage ruling\nKim Davis, a former clerk who refused gay couples, brought the appeal.\nTen years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision.\nKim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees.\nIn a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses.\nMore fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was \"egregiously wrong.\"\n\"The mistake must be corrected,\" wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell \"legal fiction.\"\nThe petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Davis is seen as one of the only Americans currently with legal standing to bring a challenge to the precedent.\n\"If there ever was a case of exceptional importance,\" Staver wrote, \"the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it.\"\nLower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk \"cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.\"\nDavis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law.\n\"Not a single judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention,\" said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News.\nA renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent\nDavis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy.\nAt the time Obergefell was decided in 2015, 35 states had statutory or constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only eight states had enacted laws explicitly allowing the unions.\nSo far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal.\nIn June, the Southern Baptist Convention -- the nation's largest Protestant Christian denomination -- overwhelmingly voted to make \"overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that defy God's design for marriage and family\" a top priority.\nSupport for equal marriage rights softening\nWhile a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020.\nAmong Republicans, support has notably dipped over the past decade, down from 55% in 2021 to 41% this year, Gallup found.\nDavis' petition argues the issue of marriage should be treated the same way the court handled the issue of abortion in its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade. She zeroes in on Justice Clarence Thomas' concurrence in that case, in which he explicitly called for revisiting Obergefell.\nThe justices \"should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights.\n\"It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now,\" said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law.\nBlackman predicts many members of the Supreme Court's conservative majority would want prospective challenges to Obergefell to percolate in lower courts before revisiting the debate.\nThe court is expected to formally consider Davis' petition this fall during a private conference when the justices discuss which cases to add to their docket. If the case is accepted, it would likely be scheduled for oral argument next spring and decided by the end of June 2026. The court could also decline the case, allowing a lower court ruling to stand and avoid entirely the request to revisit Obergefell.\n\"Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seem wildly uninterested. Maybe Justice Neil Gorsuch, too,\" said Sarah Isgur, an ABC News legal analyst and host of the legal podcast Advisory Opinions.\n\"There is no world in which the court takes the case as a straight gay marriage case,\" Isgur added. \"It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement.\"\nRuling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages\nIf the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law.\nDavis first appealed the Supreme Court in 2019 seeking to have the damages suit against her tossed out, but her petition was rejected. Conservative Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito concurred with the decision at the time.\n\"This petition implicates important questions about the scope of our decision in Obergefell, but it does not cleanly present them,\" Thomas wrote in a statement.\nMany LGBTQ advocates say they are apprehensive about the shifting legal and political landscape around marriage rights.\nThere are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Nearly one in five of those married couples is parenting a child under 18.\nSince the Obergefell decision, the makeup of the Supreme Court has shifted rightward, now including three appointees of President Donald Trump and a 6-justice conservative supermajority.\nChief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as \"an act of will, not legal judgment\" with \"no basis in the Constitution.\" He also warned then that it \"creates serious questions about religious liberty.\"\nDavis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year."

In Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine, waves could reach heights of 15 feet into Saturday.\nHigh rip current risks are still possible through the weekend along parts of the East Coast, making for dangerous beach conditions.\nErin will likely become a post-tropical on Friday going into Saturday as it races out to sea.\n-ABC News' Melissa Griffin"
