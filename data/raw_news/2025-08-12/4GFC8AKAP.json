  "title": "Businesses Focused on Navigating Uncertainty, Says Marsh McLennan CEO",
  "description": "Marsh McLennan CEO John Doyle tells Open Interest that navigating complexity is the central concern for businesses today, particularly dealing with near-term uncertainty and managing the longer term impact of AI. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Let's talk a little bit about what the mood music is like. We do know that just the outright mentions of recessions are going down, but what are some of the big issues that are really keeping CEOs up at night? Well, good morning. It's great to be with you. Yeah, we spend a lot of time and have the privilege of advising businesses all over the world trying to navigate the current environment. And, you know, the complexity of the moment is really what what stands out. And so, you know, whether it's ground wars, trade wars, culture wars, the promise and risks around A.I. and emerging technologies, extreme weather events, creating chaos for for humans and humankind around the world, but also for for supply chains and for for economies. And so navigating that complexity is the challenge of the moment. And trying to grow their business through that is, you know, is their focus. And you know, what I would say in our dialogues with with clients all over the world, they're a bit more focused on the short term in navigating some of this uncertainty while at the same time sorting out how I might impact their business or their industry. Can I just add another headwind to that? Sure. Because there is this trend that seems to be evolving since the start of Trump's presidency and that is calling out specific CEOs. It was Walmart at the start of the year. It was Intel last week. Today it is Goldman Sachs is David Solomon. How would you advise a company to deal with something as complex as a president, specifically singling out a CEO for something he doesn't like? Well, it's clear the playbook in Washington has changed. Right. And so we all recognize that. And, you know, we're all trying to navigate how that how those changes have manifested themselves over the course of the year. There's a lot of good things that are happening. And in balancing trade and opportunities for American based businesses all over the world. And so as a community, we're bracing those kinds of things, but also trying to really understand the priorities of the administration and how our businesses may run into some of these issues. So it's not head down or rolls out to represent our companies and our businesses and the markets that we're trying to serve. And so, you know, heads up and communicate and communicate effectively. Well, something that I don't think I heard you mentioned and forgive me if you did when it comes to that worry list of concerns, what about cybersecurity? It feels like that is an ever present evergreen sort of issue that's floating out there. Well, I didn't mention it specifically, but it's part of the perils around A.I. and the rapid development of large language models. And so, you know, our our biggest business inside of Marsh McLennan is our risk businesses and welcome relief for our clients. And prices have actually been moderating over the course of the year, which is which is terrific for our clients. However, the cost of risk continues to escalate and cyber is a great example of that. And and so planning for and really doing a lot of scenario planning around certain cyber events and more extreme cyber events as a result of AI generated risks is an important part of our advising clients today. With the list of risks, there's an expectation that we're likely to get an active wildfire season coming up. Already. It follows the start of the year, the devastation that we saw in Southern California. Just how different is the market and the insurance market following that? Well, as I mentioned, prices have begun to moderate during the course of this year. That's after several years, the price increases. And so the insurance market is pricing in a much higher level of of catastrophe risk. Wind, flood, fire, quake. So much higher pricing is built in. And so we got off to a. From an economic standpoint, obviously, human tragedy in what happened in southern California. But from an economic perspective, we got off to a tough, tough start with the wildfires in southern California. Right now. There are wildfires raging in more remote parts of California, in Canada. There are there's news this morning from from Europe, in Turkey, for example, that Dardanelles, you know, facing shut down through the Dardanelles. And so it's another area that drives supply chain risk. But also we need to build back in a more resilient way. Right. And so insurance in the insurance industry and risk financing will be there. But we have a lot of data and information about how to build more resilient communities and more resilient economies. 40 to $50 billion of insured loss in Southern California, but $150 billion economic hit when I'm sure the governor in California would rather be investing in other ways. Yeah, absolutely. Well, in addition to, of course, wildfires and these weather events, you also mentioned on your earnings call that pushing up the price of insurance. Your insurance costs are nuclear vertical. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more information about what that means and what effect that's happening. So nuclear verdicts, you know, in our industry, we're in the business of helping clients think through some of those more severe scenarios, 100 million judgments or more up 400. Over the course of the last decade. So you have a very powerful plaintiff's bar in the United States. You have increased litigation funding as an asset class in the United States, fueling what is a growing cost of risk around liability insurance. The United States by far today, already has the highest cost of liability insurance of any market around the world. And I'm very, very worried about I mentioned that prices are coming down. Liability insurance prices are continuing to escalate. And so there was an opportunity in the one big beautiful bill to straighten out some tax incentives around litigation funding. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. And so as an industry, we were quite vocal about that opportunity. Funding is just one aspect of it. There's tort reform that needs to happen at the state level. It's happened in Georgia. It's happened a bit in the state of Florida as well. And so as an industry, we're helping our clients think through how to manage that rising cost of risk. John, If we can just end around where we started this idea of navigating a lot of headwinds. To what degree are you seeing companies still frozen and putting off investment decisions because of that or moving forward now? We're starting to see a bit more clarity. Right. And I think some of the bigger downside scenarios around the trade discussions all over the world have begun to come in. Right. And so so we're starting to see M & A activity pick up, for example. But also, businesses need to make decisions. You need to move forward. And so obviously, there's still more clarity in front of us and how it impacts the economy and ultimately settling many of these trade negotiations around the world. But but we're starting to see some level of clarity, and that's helpful, obviously, to the economy.",
