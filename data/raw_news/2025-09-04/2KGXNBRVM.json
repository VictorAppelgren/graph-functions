  "title": "Samsung's Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Is Just as Thin as Apple's iPad Pro",
  "description": "The company unpacked two new flagship Android tablets at IFA 2025, alongside a fifth entry in the Galaxy S25 series.",
  "content": "Google may have given up on making Android tablets, but Samsung is putting along. Last week, Samsung announced a budget slate\u2014the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite\u2014but now it's time for flagship tablets. At IFA 2025, the tech exhibition in Berlin, the company announced the next-gen Galaxy Tab S11 series, comprising the Tab S11 and the Tab S11 Ultra. Also in tow is the Galaxy S25 FE (Fan Edition), a midrange Android phone that marks the fifth entry in the Galaxy S25 series.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S11 costs $800, while the Tab S11+ is $1,200, and the Galaxy S25 FE starts at $650. All of these devices are available for purchase today. Here's what you need to know.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra are the iPad Pro of the Android world, boasting flagship specs across the board. They can even match Apple's latest slate in one key metric: thickness. Apple highlighted the remarkable thinness of the M4-powered iPad Pro when it launched in 2024, and now the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra matches it\u2014both Apple\u2019s and Samsung's top-tier tablets are a mere 0.20 inches thick (5.1 mm). The cheaper Tab S11 is 0.22 inches, which is a hair thicker than the 11-inch iPad Pro. Samsung's tablets are slightly heavier, though.\n\nUnlike the prior generation Tab S10 series, there's no middle \u201cPlus\u201d model anymore. You have the 11-inch Tab S11 and the gargantuan 14.6-inch Tab S11 Ultra. Both run Android 16 out of the box, have 120-Hz AMOLED displays, and can hit a peak brightness of 1,600 nits. Samsung's S Pen stylus is bundled as usual, but it has been redesigned for the first time in years, with a hexagonal design for better grip and a cone-shaped tip for increased tilt angles and finer control. It magnetically sticks to the top edge of the slate for storage and charging.",

      "text": "Another year, another version of Google\u2019s mobile operating system. Android 16 brings a whole new look (Apple also just announced a redesign in iOS 26), more customization options, some chunky security enhancements, and a few welcome accessibility improvements. Android 16 is rolling out to select devices today\u2014these are the new features that caught our eye.\nGoogle officially ditched the delicious dessert names for Android years ago with Android 10, but it still uses them internally. Android 15 was Vanilla Ice Cream, and Android 16 is codenamed Baklava.\nWhen Is Android 16 Arriving for Your Phone?\nThe official release date for Android 16 is June 10. This release is earlier than usual (last year\u2019s release was September), and Google has already scheduled another \u201cminor\u201d release, maybe Android 16.1, for the last quarter of 2025. The developer preview of Android 16 was released in November 2024, and Google dropped beta releases in January, February, March, and April.\nGoogle's Pixel phones always get the new Android version first, but Android 16 is also coming to select devices from Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, Motorola, Nothing, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Samsung, Sony, Sharp, Vivo, and Xiaomi in the coming months. Check your phone manufacturer's website, forums, or social media to learn when (if ever) to expect Android 16.\nHow to Download and Install Android 16\nFolks with a Google Pixel phone (Pixel 6 and newer) can download Android 16 by going to Settings > System > Software updates > System update and tapping Check for update.\nIf you can't wait, you may be able to install the Android 16 Beta. These prerelease versions enable developers to test the forthcoming version of Google\u2019s mobile operating system, learn about the new features, and prepare their apps or games to work properly. They also give early adopters the chance to get a sneak peek.\nBeta releases are more stable than developer previews, but some bugs are likely, and there are a few hoops to jump through to install them, so it\u2019s not recommended for everyone. If you want to try it, you need a supported partner device (including select phones from Honor, Oppo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi), and you must sign up for the Android Beta Program. Most folks who sign up will get the beta updates over the air without wiping their phones, but you can\u2019t opt out of the beta program without factory resetting your phone. Make sure you back up your Android phone first.\nUpdates usually pop up automatically, but you can always check whether you have the latest version in Settings > System > System update by tapping Check for update. Want to get off the beta and go back to Android 15? Go to Google's Android Beta page, scroll down to find your device, and hit Opt out. This will wipe all locally saved data, so you'll lose anything you haven\u2019t backed up. You should get a prompt to return to the older version.\nTop Android 16 Features\nThese are the features and improvements coming in Android 16 we're most excited about. You can learn more at Google\u2019s developer site, and make sure to read our interview with Google\u2019s Android chief about his hopes for the platform.\nGoogle is introducing real-time tracking into your Android notifications for services, like food delivery and navigation. Instead of having to open up the relevant app, you\u2019ll see live updates in the notification drawer showing when your Uber will arrive or what turn to take next if you\u2019re traveling somewhere using directions. These Live Updates will be the top notification and also appear on the Always-on Display, so you can see at a glance when your food will arrive via an app like DoorDash. Pull down to expand the notification, and you\u2019ll see a progress bar and quick links to actions, such as the option to call or message the driver.\nSimilar to Live Activities in Apple\u2019s iOS, Live Updates may be implemented slightly differently by each manufacturer. Samsung apparently plans to roll Live Updates into its Now Bar that sits at the bottom of the lock screen, while OnePlus will integrate them into its existing Live Alerts system.\nThis new extra-secure mode in Android 16 is for at-risk folks, like public figures, journalists, and activists, who need extra protection for their digital lives. Google\u2019s Advanced Protection already exists for Google accounts but now extends to Android 16, imposing tough security settings on apps and services to keep your data safe. It includes checks on memory to block exploits, USB protection, and guards against unsafe websites and spam calls and messages. A later release will add intrusion detection by keeping a permanent end-to-end encrypted log from your device in the cloud, which can be shared and analyzed by a security expert if you suspect there\u2019s a problem.\nSadly, fraud is big business. Most folks have seen a scam on their phone at some point, whether disguised as tech support, a prize, or a crypto investment opportunity. Google is using on-device AI to spot scam texts with the Scam Detection feature in Google Messages. It runs locally on-device, so no message content is shared, and shows a pop-up warning to folks when it discovers a suspected scam, warning them of the risk and offering the opportunity to report and block the scammer. Some permissions will also be blocked during phone calls, so scammers can no longer walk people through the process to sideload a malicious app.\nHealth Connect enables different health, fitness, and wellbeing apps to share data covering your health in certain categories (Activity, Body Measurement, Cycle Tracking, Nutrition, Sleep, and Vitals). Google is now adding support for Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard widely used by health care providers. It\u2019s unclear exactly how this will work or what data it will include, but it may make sharing health records easier.\nAs one of the newest Bluetooth features, Auracast enables audio streaming to hearing aids and other supported devices in public spaces. Several people can use it to connect to the same audio stream simultaneously and get audio from TVs in public spaces like the gym, for example, or stream audio directly to hearing aids at a public concert. Android 16 supports broadcasting, so you can go to Settings > Connected devices > Audio sharing and choose to share audio from your device with nearby devices that support Bluetooth LE Audio, which includes Auracast.\nWhile some apps restrict resizing and screen orientation, Google is removing this default capability in Android 16. Every app should now adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios, including tablets and folding phones. Google also wants developers to ensure that app content is displayed edge to edge.\nGoogle is redacting content in sensitive notifications, such as one-time passwords, when it detects the potential risk of someone else seeing the notification. This might be if you are not connected to your home Wi-Fi and haven\u2019t unlocked your phone in a while.\nFor folks with low vision and reduced contrast sensitivity, Google is detecting text that might be an issue and drawing a high-contrast color box underneath it to ensure the text is as legible as possible.\nThere are a couple of notable new features for folks using Bluetooth LE Audio hearing aids with Android 16. First is the option to switch between the built-in microphones on the hearing aids and the microphone on your phone for voice calls. Second is the ability to adjust the ambient sound volume picked up by your hearing aid's microphones. Both could prove helpful in noisy environments with a lot of background noise.\nGoogle is pushing a host of small camera improvements in Android 16 for keen photographers. There\u2019s hybrid auto exposure, allowing a balance of automatic and manual ISO and exposure control, precise color temperature and tint adjustments, better night mode support for apps, and support for Ultra HDR images in the HEIC file format. Google is also adding the Advanced Professional Video codec for higher-quality video recording and post-processing.\nHave you ever wished Android was more like Windows? Support for desktop windowing, enabling you to run multiple apps simultaneously, is in the works. Multitaskers will be able to resize windows, and the new feature will work seamlessly with split screen (just like the new iPadOS 26). Google is also adding connected display support, so you can attach an external display to your Android device and discover the joys of a dual-screen setup. Currently part of the developer preview, this won't come to your Android tablet until later this year.\nThe latest evolution of Google\u2019s Android design language is Material 3 Expressive. While it\u2019s not a complete overhaul, it is giving Android a facelift with fresh new animations, better haptic feedback, more dynamic color themes, impactful fonts, and more chances to personalize your Android device. Google has done its homework, drawing on 46 studies with more than 18,000 participants to make changes that people of all ages approved.\nBefore you get too excited, Material 3 Expressive won\u2019t be part of the June release, instead rolling out on Pixel phones first, later this year, and then on other Android devices. Impatient folks may get a peek by signing up for the Android Beta Program.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

      "text": "The Best Android Tablets\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThe best Android tablet? When you think tablet, your mind may gravitate toward the iPad, but maybe you don't want to be a part of Apple's ecosystem. After all, the right slate is the one that perfectly fits into your life, regardless of whether you want to watch videos, play games, read books or comics, work, or do a bit of everything on it. The good news is that there are so many Android tablets that you have some nice options.\nOur top pick is the OnePlus Pad 3, which we\u2019ve chosen because it\u2019s a superb all-rounder and is available with a collection of accessories to make it more useful. If you have more specific uses for your Android tablet in mind, we\u2019ve got separate categories to make choosing one less arduous.\nBe sure to check out our other buying guides, including the Best Tablets, Best iPad, Best Tablets for Kids, Best Amazon Fire Tablets, and Best iPad Accessories.\nWhy Not Buy an Apple iPad?\nThe iPad is a brilliant tablet, regardless of which model you buy. A big part of its appeal is Apple\u2019s software which is tailored to the big screen and will only get better with the introduction of iPadOS 26, the wealth of tablet-specific apps available, and the many services that sync all your Apple products together. If you own an iPhone or a Mac, the iPad neatly and seamlessly interacts with them, and Apple\u2019s online services like iCloud and AirDrop make using them all together a fuss-free experience.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t own any other Apple products or have an Android phone, many of these benefits will be lost. Google has many similar services for Android, and an Android tablet makes a good buy if you have an Android phone already. Manufacturers also build their own special features into software, so pairing a Samsung phone with a Samsung tablet, or a OnePlus phone with a OnePlus tablet, makes good sense. That said, if you\u2019re shopping for both a new tablet and a new smartphone, then do seriously consider an iPhone and an iPad.\nIt was once the case that Android tablets had poor app support and the hardware was cheaper than an iPad, but these stereotypes don\u2019t really apply anymore. App support is far better than it used to be, and in the same way certain iPad tablets cost as much as a laptop, so do some Android tablets. Ultimately, whether you consider an iPad may come down to what smartphone you currently use.\nOther Tablets to Consider\nGoogle Pixel Tablet for $399: Google has a spotty history with Android tablets, going from the highs of the Nexus 7 to the, well, distinct averageness of the Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The 10.2-inch LCD screen is one of the highlights; the size and 439-gram weight are just right for carrying around, and Google\u2019s fuss-free Android software is simple and logical. However, the Google Tensor G2 processor can get hot under strain, and there\u2019s only 8 GB of RAM. What makes it special is the Speaker Dock, which turns the Pixel Tablet into a big smart home display. But unlike the Nest Hub Max, you can take the screen off the dock and use it separately. The Charging Dock\u2019s speaker is loud and sounds excellent, and the Pixel Tablet\u2019s microphones and large screen make using Gemini so easy. It's especially great if you are in the Google Home smart home ecosystem, as you can set the lock screen to double as a control panel for all your devices. Used alone, the Pixel Tablet can\u2019t compete with the OnePlus Pad 3 or Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE, but with the dock, it becomes a unique dual-use product with an emphasis on the smart home.\nGrandPad for $780: If you want a tablet for an elderly relative, or you feel you\u2019d rather have a single, easy-to-use device instead of a tablet and a phone, the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) may be an option worth investigating. It\u2019s an 8-inch tablet with a front and rear camera, which comes with a case, a charging dock, a stylus, plus an included 4G LTE connection. The interface has been simplified and is controlled using large buttons with clear text, plus quick access to key websites, apps, and features, including voice and video calls. The GrandPad is designed to help those who aren\u2019t familiar with technology still enjoy all it has to offer. In addition to the basics, there are 15 different games, curated music stations, streaming radio, a magnifying glass and flashlight tool, email, and a private family-only voice and video call network. There\u2019s also fast, 24/7 customer support should anyone run into problems, and a companion app for other family members. We love the GrandPad\u2019s concept and the way it promises to help more people enjoy modern technology without concern or feeling overwhelmed by complex software. However, you don\u2019t purchase it like other tablets on our list, and the GrandPad has a monthly subscription attached. Pay up front for a year, and it costs $780, while the monthly plan costs $95 per month. And while this does include the 4G LTE connection and 24/7 customer support, it still makes it an expensive system. However, what it offers is unusual, and few other tablets make using the software so simple, and the customer support may be worth the price alone for some.\nAmazon Fire HD 8: Small tablets aren\u2019t common anymore, but the Fire HD 8 gets both the size and the price right. The 8-inch screen has a 1280 x 800-pixel resolution, which may not sound like much, but it\u2019s fine for watching videos and playing a few games. Like the Fire Max 11, it has Amazon\u2019s version of Android without Google Play installed, but you\u2019ll still be able to download Netflix and most other video apps, plus get access to all the content on Amazon Prime. The compact dimensions and 337-gram weight make it great for carrying around in a bag, the battery roughly lasts 13 hours on a single charge, and there are a pair of cameras for video calling too. It\u2019s not a high-performance tablet\u2014there\u2019s only 32 GB of storage on the cheapest model, and even the charging is basic, with a full charge likely to take a massive five hours. However, because it\u2019s $100, it's easy to forgive the shortcomings. If you want a more powerful small tablet, the Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 will be a better choice, but neither is suited for work due to the small screen. Amazon regularly puts its Kindle and Fire ranges on sale, so look out for better deals if you\u2019re not in a hurry.\nTablet Accessories\nTwelve South HoverBar Duo (Gen 2) for $80: Twelve South will tell you the HoverBar Duo is designed for the Apple iPad, but look down into its FAQ and you\u2019ll find it\u2019s also compatible with other devices with a minimum 5-inch and maximum 8.68-inch height. Check the specs, and this means it\u2019ll hold the OnePlus Pad 3, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE, and many other devices, too. It\u2019s great news, as iPad owners can\u2019t keep this excellent stand to themselves. We like it due to the QuickSwitch tab, which lets you unclip the flexible arm from its desktop stand and attach it to a shelf mount, considerably increasing its versatility. Desktop stands are fine if you\u2019re using the tablet on a table, but the shelf mount means your tablet can be kept off the surface, making it handy for use in the kitchen or in places where a surface may not be available at all, such as the bathroom or bedroom. Twelve South\u2019s products are always well-made and attractively designed.\nKeychron B1 Pro for $40: If you want to work on a tablet, you\u2019re probably going to need a physical keyboard. There are specific keyboard cases available for most tablets, but they can be very expensive, and are not the only option. A standalone Bluetooth keyboard makes good sense as it can be used with other mobile devices or a desktop computer. Choose wisely, and it\u2019s easy to carry around too. Keychron\u2019s keyboards are all excellent, and the 425-gram, 75% layout B1 Pro is a very good choice if you want to slip it into your bag along with your tablet. Keychron claims the internal battery will last for 1,200 hours on a single charge, the keyboard\u2019s map can be customized, and it\u2019s compatible with both Windows and Mac computers when you\u2019re not using it with a tablet. Unfortunately, the keyboard is not backlit, which does limit its use a little, but for $40, it\u2019s a solid value considering its versatility, the build quality, and the pleasing typing experience.\nIkea Havrehoj Tablet Stand for $15: There are dozens, even hundreds, of different stands for tablets, but this one from Ikea represents a strong blend of value, design, and versatility. It\u2019s made of metal with a soft, cork surface where the tablet rests, with the ability to raise, lower, and angle the platform to get exactly the right position. There\u2019s even a little hook on the back of the stand for a pair of headphones. The tablet support has a gap in the middle, so you can still charge the slate in portrait orientation. Ikea's tablet stand is suitably minimalist, works for any brand of tablet, and at $15, it\u2019s an excellent value too. Pair it with the Keychron B1 Pro keyboard, and you\u2019ve got a cool, low-cost setup for work and video.\nStaedtler Noris Digital Pencil for $28: The world of styluses is confusing. There are two different standards to be aware of, and famed writing implement brand Staedtler supports devices with an EMR screen, which includes Samsung\u2019s phones and tablets, along with a host of Chromebooks and other tablets. The Noris is made from upcycled wood for a truly tactile feel, a 0.7-mm tip modeled on a classic pencil, and 4,096 levels of pressure to make it appealing to artists. The Noris is a fun alternative to Samsung\u2019s S Pen range. It doesn\u2019t have a battery, so it doesn\u2019t need recharging. You don\u2019t have to install special software; it\u2019s compatible with a tablet\u2019s screen rather than particular apps, and even comes in two sizes to make it suitable for different hand sizes.\nPenoval USI 2.0 Stylus for $60: The EMR standard is joined by the USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) standard, and it\u2019s used by the Google Pixel Tablet, the Amazon Fire Max 11, and a host of Chromebooks. The Penoval USI 2.0 Stylus has a D-shaped aluminum body for extra grip and feel, a triangular nib, and magnets inside to attach it to your tablet\u2019s body. Unlike the EMR stylus, which takes power from the device\u2019s screen, the USI stylus has its own battery, which should last around 90 hours before it requires a recharge using a USB-C cable. Like the EMR stylus, it has 4.096 levels of pressure sensitivity, palm rejection technology, and an eraser on the end of the pencil. This may sound like a small thing, but it\u2019s a wonderful part of the stylus experience, as turning the pen over to erase something on screen is surprisingly rewarding. It doesn\u2019t need pairing with your tablet either, so it works immediately.\nSamsung Type-C USB Flash Drive for $27: Some Android tablets have expandable storage space using a microSD card, but not all of them do. In addition to buying an external storage device to increase the native memory, you may find it necessary to transfer files between devices, and an external drive makes this simple. There are many options out there, but we like the portability, range of memory options, durability, and speed of Samsung\u2019s Type-C USB Flash Drive. The tiny memory stick supports the USB 3.2 Gen 1 standard, transfers data at 400 MB/s, connects to most devices that have a USB-C port, and is resistant to water, shock, and magnetic fields. It doesn\u2019t require a power source and is specifically made for mobile devices, so you shouldn\u2019t encounter performance or compatibility problems."

Learn more.\nApple has officially set a date for its iPhone September event, which is due to take place on September 9. This year's launch will be held at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple's campus in Cupertino, California. The company is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 range, which for the first time will include the iPhone 17 Air\u2014though that name could change\u2014Apple's thinnest and lightest iPhone to date. We're also expecting the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and the AirPods Pro 3.\nThe invitations included the tagline \u201cAwe dropping,\u201d along with the Apple logo in shades of blue and green. These are rumored to be color choices for the iPhone 17 Pro devices. The logo also moves like a heat map on Apple's website, which could allude to potential thermal improvements in the upcoming devices, or the rumored switch back to aluminum instead of titanium on the iPhone Pro models (which would also improve thermals, anyway).\nWIRED will be on the ground live-blogging the latest from Apple's presentation. In the meantime, you can brush up on all the features coming to your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Watch, as Apple usually drops the next operating system version right after the event.\nOura Is Building a Manufacturing Facility in Texas\nOura, the leading global manufacturer of smart rings, announced this week that it has plans to build a manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Oura\u2019s largest enterprise customer is the Department of Defense, and US-based manufacturing operations will support its needs. Oura has sent tens of thousands of rings to optimize performance across all branches of the US armed services. It notes that its rings are being used in four key research areas: stress management and resilience, fitness optimization, fatigue risk management, and early illness detection.\nThis announcement comes at a time when the smart ring industry is going through lots of shake-ups. The US International Trade Commission recently ruled in favor of Oura in a patent infringement case against competitors Ultrahuman and Ringconn, which have had to pull their respective rings from the US market. This is particularly bad news for Ultrahuman, which has a facility in Plano, Texas, where the company was planning to manufacture rings in the US to get around tariffs. Ultrahuman is also countersuing. (It\u2019s all very messy.)\nWe'll keep an eye on the situation as it evolves, but for now, US customers might only be able to buy an Oura ring. It\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s our favorite smart ring. \u2014Adrienne So\nPlaud Has a New Note Pin\nPlaud makes a credit card-sized AI note-taking device that listens to the world around you and then transcribes conversations, summarizing them into meeting notes with actionable insights. It began with the Plaud Note, then the Plaud NotePin, a wearable device, and this week the company unveiled the Plaud Note Pro ($179).\nIt shares a similar card-shaped design with the original, but now it features two extra microphones to pick up audio at a wider range. There's also now a 0.95-inch AMOLED screen that displays battery life, the current recording status, and the mode. Unlike the original, you don't need to flip a switch to swap from recording calls to in-person meetings\u2014the Pro will do it for you. Just long-press the button once to start recording. You can highlight key information during a meeting with a short press, and you can type in the phone app simultaneously to add your thoughts; they'll be contextualized to the recording instantly. Plaud also lets you snap a photo with your phone to add additional context.\nPlaud's Note Pro can identify and label individual speakers in its transcriptions, and it can transcribe 112 languages. You can also ask Plaud (via the app) a specific question from your notes, so there's no need to hunt for key details. It employs large language models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The Note Pro is up for preorder now and ships in October. You get 300 transcription minutes per month, but you'll have to cough up $100 per year to quadruple that and get access to new features faster. (There's a plan that offers unlimited transcription minutes for $240 annually.)\nLevel Launches a Discreet Smart Lock\nLevel Home makes some of the sneakiest smart locks you\u2019ll find. The company's original lock stays hidden inside your existing lock, but its latest designs are full lock replacements that look like everyday locks instead of bulky smart ones. The new Level Lock Pro embraces that design ethos. It looks like a simple front door lock with a small face, and doesn\u2019t look large enough to have smart home features. But it does.\nThere\u2019s no keypad (though you can purchase one for $79) or biometric reader, but it does work with Apple's Home keys or NFC key fobs, along with a physical key. It can connect to devices via Bluetooth if your Wi-Fi goes down. It\u2019s also Matter compatible. The Pro has an even smaller design than its predecessor, the Level Lock, and Level says the Pro is faster and more efficient with a dual-core microprocessor built into the lock. It also has door status detection, so it can tell you whether the door is closed or ajar without any additional accessories.\nThe Level Lock Pro is available now for $349 and comes in either a black matte or silver finish. \u2014Nena Farrell\nChipolo Debuts Rechargeable Bluetooth Trackers\nChipolo\u2019s been making Bluetooth trackers we like for a while, but you've always had to manually replace the battery. No more! Chipolo\u2019s new Card and Loop trackers are rechargeable, and the company claims six months of battery life on a single charge.\nBoth devices offer 400 feet of Bluetooth range. The larger card-sized tracker is designed for wallets, while the little Loop is a small circle you can add to a keyring, dog collar, or even sneak into your kid\u2019s backpack. While Chipolo has been our favorite for Android, it works with both Apple and Android\u2019s native device-tracking apps (Find My and Find Hub, respectively), and Chipolo has a companion app that the tracker will pair with for extra features.\nThe charging style varies for these two models, with the smaller Loop recharging via USB-C and the larger Card capable of using Qi wireless chargers. Chipolo doesn't include any chargers or cords, so choose the model you\u2019ve already got the equipment for. The trackers are available for preorder, with the Card and Loop on sale for $39. They'll ship in October. \u2014Nena Farrell\nSamsung Quietly Unearths a New Budget Tablet\nGoogle may have given up on tablets, but Samsung's churning on. Early this week, the company introduced its latest entry-level slate, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite, padding the existing Tab S10 series. It has a 10.9-inch screen that can hit up to 600 nits of peak brightness, Samsung's Exynos 1380 processor (the same as in the Galaxy A26), and starts with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. There's a microSD card slot so you can expand space if you need it. As usual, the S Pen stylus comes included in the box. It starts at $349 and goes on sale September 4.\nThe Tab S10 Lite comes right as rumors are bubbling up about Samsung's next tablet generation, the Galaxy Tab S11 series, which purportedly includes the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. This week, Samsung announced a virtual Galaxy Event on September 4, kicking off the festivities at the IFA consumer tech show in Berlin. That's likely where we'll learn more about these flagship Android tablets, and likely the Galaxy S25 FE midrange smartphone.\nNothing Used Stock Photos for Its Phone (3) Demo Units\nHere's a weird one. Early in the week, I received an anonymous email from someone claiming that Nothing had used stock photography to pass as photos shot with the company's Phone (3), which launched early in July. This source provided a screen recording of an in-store demo unit that showed a handful of images, which Nothing claimed were shot on the Phone (3).\nMost of these photos were on the Stills photo licensing platform, so I reached out to two of the photographers\u2014Roman Fox and Henry Han\u2014and both claimed Nothing purchased the photos under a standard digital use license. Fox says his photo was captured on a Fujifilm XH2s, and Han says he used a mirrorless camera. Clearly, none of the photos in these demo units were shot by a Nothing smartphone.\nX content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nNothing cofounder Akis Evangelidis took to X to break down what happened, citing that initial live demo units need placeholder images four months before the launch of the phone. These are supposed to be replaced as the company enters mass production with actual photo samples with a new version of the live demo unit. \u201cIt was brought to our attention that some live demo units' stock imagery were not updated,\u201d Evangelidis says. The company is working to rectify this so that all demo units reflect the latest version, with no stock photography.\nIt's a reasonable explanation, and I checked prior marketing materials and Nothing's own reviewer's guide and didn't find any of these stock photos present. Han points out that Nothing licensed the photos from April 28, 2025, through October 28, 2026, which doesn't quite line up with Evangelidis' timeline and also runs for longer than necessary. However, the transaction statement says \u201cArbok LDU\" with \u201cStock Images\u201d as the project description; Arbok is likely the codename for the Phone (3), and LDU stands for Live Demo Unit. All of which suggests that the company isn't lying. Maybe just use Phone (2) sample images as a placeholder next time."

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nFINDING THE BEST iPad should be simple. You just get whatever\u2019s new, right? If only. Apple sells four main iPad models, each with its strengths and varying sizes. In addition, a growing number of older iPads are floating around the eBays of the world. Since all these devices largely look the same, it\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re buying and what you should pay for it. This guide covers the iPad models available right now, what\u2019s coming up, the important differences between them, and the old versions that exist (including the ones you shouldn\u2019t buy at any price). I also break down which Apple Pencil is right for you.\nBe sure to check out all our buying guides, including the Best iPad Accessories, Best iPhones, Best iPhone 16 Cases, Best Tablets, and Best MacBooks.\nUpdated April 2025: We've added our thoughts on the Apple iPad (A16).\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore. Subscribe Today.\nWhich iPad Do You Own?\nThere are tons of iPads out in the world, and it can be tough to figure out exactly what model you own if you're thinking of selling it or you're looking for accessories and want to make sure they'll work with your iPad. Apple also doesn't name its slates sequentially as it does with the iPhone, only adding to the confusion. No matter. Finding your model is simple.\n- Look at the back of your iPad. Etched on the back cover, near where it says \"Designed by Apple in California,\" should be a model number starting with the letter A.\n- Head to this website from Apple. Look for your corresponding model number, and that's it! You found your iPad model. (Pro tip: Use your browser's \"Find in Page\" function to type in your model number and find it quickly.)\nAccessory makers usually indicate which iPad a case, folio, or keyboard cover is designed to work with. If you see a retailer mentioning a specific generation or processor, this is Apple's current lineup:\n- iPad: 11th generation (A16, 2025)\n- iPad Mini: 7th generation (A17 Pro, 2024)\n- iPad Air 11-inch: 7th generation (M3, 2025)\n- iPad Air 13-inch: 2nd generation (M3, 2025)\n- iPad Pro 11-inch: 5th generation (M4, 2024)\n- iPad Pro 13-inch: 7th generation (M4, 2024)\nExclusive iPadOS Features\nThere are a few features only available on M1, M2, M3, and M4-powered iPad models, while others are exclusive to the iPad Pro. Be sure to check out our iPadOS 18 roundup for the latest features.\n- Reference Mode: Available on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with M1, M2, and M4. Reference Mode allows you to use the tablet as a reference monitor to ensure color accuracy and consistent image quality when editing photos or videos with a secondary display.\n- Stage Manager: Available on iPads with M1, M2, M3, M4, and older iPad Pro models (2018 onward) with the A12X and A12Z chips. For a desktop-like multitasking experience, Stage Manager allows you to resize windows, overlap them, and group them together. You'll also see recently used apps and windows appear on the left side of your screen.\n- External Display Support: Available on iPads with M1, M2, M3, and M4. When using Stage Manager, you can also connect the iPad Pro and iPad Air to an external display with resolutions up to 6K. That way, instead of mirroring the iPad to the display, you can access four apps on the external display and four apps on the tablet.\n- Virtual Memory Swap: Available on iPads with M1, M2, M3, and M4. If you're in need of more memory for RAM-intensive apps, Virtual Memory Swap will increase the available memory for all your apps and provide up to 16 GB for more taxing apps. If you're using an M1-powered iPad Air, this feature is only available on the 256-GB version.\n- Apple Pencil Hover: Available on both sizes of the iPad Pro (M2 and M4) and iPad Air (M2 and M3). Using the second-generation Apple Pencil (on the M2-powered iPad Pro) and Apple Pencil Pro, you can hover the stylus millimeters above the screen and see a preview of what will happen before touching the display. For example, with a third-party graphic editing app like Pixelmator, hovering allows you to cycle through presets to see a live preview, or you can hover over a cropped photo to see the original image.\nWhich iPads Support Apple Intelligence?\nApple has been on a tirade touting Apple Intelligence, a suite of artificial intelligence features available in select hardware across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We break down many of the new Apple Intelligence features in our iOS 18 roundup if you'd like to learn more. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not available on all iPad models. The following iPads support Apple Intelligence:\n- iPad Mini (7th gen, A17 Pro)\n- iPad Air (5th gen, M1)\n- iPad Air (6th gen, M2)\n- iPad Air (7th gen, M3)\n- iPad Pro (5th gen, M1)\n- iPad Pro (6th gen, M2)\n- iPad Pro (7th gen, M4)\nAvoid These iPads\nThe iPad Mini 1 through 5 and iPad 1 through 9 have low-resolution, pixelated screens or are just too old. Forget buying one of the old 2014 iPad Air 1 or 2015 Air 2\u2014those are too long in the tooth. Just don\u2019t. Yes, money is tight, but your sanity is important. There\u2019s a chance an older iPad could perform decently, but unless someone is giving you one for free, try to hunt for a newer model. Many of the older iPads no longer receive software updates, and they'll seem quite slow compared to your phone and your computer.\nPeruse our Best Tablets guide for ideas if you don't want to spend a lot. If you\u2019re buying something for a child to use, our Best Kids' Tablets guide has good options with kid-friendly features and parental controls.\nShould You Buy an Older iPad Pro?\nApple has always packed a little extra into its iPad Pro tablets. It's still totally fine to buy the 2021 11-inch iPad Pro and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro if you can even find them, but try not to spend more than $600 and $850, respectively. Anything more and you may as well buy the latest. These models are all powerful and match the current Pro slates in many ways; they also work with the first-generation Magic Keyboard with Trackpad. But again, cross-check prices with more recent models.\nOlder iPad Pro models, like the models from 2018 or 2020, are not worth buying (if they're even available). They're just too old.\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy?\nYes. Apple launched a new iPad Air and base iPad in March of this year. There was also a new iPad Pro in May of 2024, along with a new iPad Mini in October. Apple may be working on an M5-powered iPad Pro for later this year, but the M4 model is still an excellent tablet and plenty powerful.\nOther iPads to Consider\nApple no longer sells these iPads, but these slightly older models are still good options, as long as you can find them for the right discount. I recommend checking third-party retailers (like Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H). I also suggest cross-checking the price with the latest models to make sure you're spending a fair amount less on the older tablet. Older models not mentioned here are increasingly hard to find and might not be worth it.\niPad Pro (2022, 6th Gen): These iPad Pro tablets (7/10, WIRED Review) use the same M2 chip that's inside the MacBook Air (2022), Mac Mini, and iPad Air (2024). It also has an excellent mini-LED screen (with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate) along with a dual camera system (with a lidar sensor), a front-facing camera with support for Center Stage, as well as great speakers and mics. It's compatible with the original Magic Keyboard case, second-generation Apple Pencil, and Apple Pencil with USB-C. I only recommend it if you can find the 11-inch for $749 or less and the 12.9-inch for $900 or less.\niPad Air (2022, 5th Gen): This iPad Air has an M1 processor (which can also be found in the 2020 MacBook Air), a 10.9-inch LCD screen, a USB-C port, Touch ID built into the top power button, and 5G support. It's a great, lightweight tablet that's plenty powerful for most tasks. It packs support for the second-generation Apple Pencil, Apple Pencil with USB-C, and the Magic Keyboard case. I only recommend it for $450 or less.\niPad (2022, 10th Gen): The 10th gen iPad comes with an A14 Bionic chip (the same that's in the iPhone 12), a modern design (in fun colors, too), 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, a USB-C port, Touch ID integrated into the power button, a 12-megapixel selfie camera, 12-megapixel rear camera, and support for 5G. It's also compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil, Apple Pencil (USB-C), Magic Keyboard Folio, and Smart Folio. It's worth noting, however, that the display isn't fully laminated, so there's a gap between the screen and the glass that might make the Apple Pencil feel less precise. It's a solid choice if you're looking for a basic, affordable iPad. But seeing as how it's now three years old, I only recommend it for $260 or less.\niPad Air (2024, M2): This iPad Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is less than a year old, so it's still an excellent option. You'll have the choice between an 11-inch and a 13-inch Liquid Retina display, but both are powered by an M2 chip (the same one that powers the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro from 2022). Additional features include a USB-C port, Touch ID built into the power button, and a 12-megapixel sensor in landscape orientation (with support for Center Stage). It's also compatible with Apple Pencil (USB-C), Apple Pencil Pro, first-gen Magic Keyboard case, and the Smart Folio case. I only recommend it if you can find the 11-inch version for under $400 and the 13-inch for $600 or less.\nGreat iPad Accessories\niPad accessories are endless. Below, we've highlighted some of our favorites to round out your tablet experience, and you can find more in our Best iPad Accessories guide.\nZugu Case for $50: This is our favorite folio case for the iPad for multiple reasons. It's not only durable (complete with a rigid bumper), but it also has a magnetized cover that stays shut and a flap that allows you to position the screen at eight different angles. The case is magnetic, allowing you to stick it on the fridge securely. It's also reasonably priced, comes in an array of colors, and has a spot for your Apple Pencil.\nSatechi M1 Wireless Mouse for $30: We're already big fans of Satechi's accessories at WIRED, and this mouse didn't disappoint. It has a comfortable ergonomic design, a sleek aluminum finish, and smooth scrolling. It has great battery life too\u2014with a built-in lithium-ion battery, I've been using it for the past four months and have yet to charge it.\nMageasy CoverBuddy Case (iPad Pro) for $65: This case allows you to magnetically connect it to Apple's Magic Keyboard case without having to take off the case each time. It feels durable and doesn't add too much bulk to the iPad. There's also a slot for the Apple Pencil Pro or the USB-C version. The company also offers the CoverBuddy Lite for the iPad Air (M2).\nLogitech Combo Touch (10th-Gen) for $220: The Combo Touch (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a built-in keyboard, trackpad, and kickstand, making it ideal for getting work done on your iPad. It's also detachable, so you can easily remove the keyboard when you don't need it. It connects via Apple's Smart Connector, meaning you never need to tinker with Bluetooth or bother charging it. It's also available for the iPad Pro (M4) (although it does add a bit of weight to such a thin tablet) and the iPad Air (M2).\nCasetify Impact Screen Protector for $56: If you're worried about damaging your iPad screen, I recommend this protector from Casetify. It's super thin, has excellent touch sensitivity, and is mostly fingerprint-resistant (I've wiped some smudges here and there). It's painless to apply\u2014the company supplies a microfiber cloth, a de-dusting sticker, and wet and dry wipes.\nPaperlike Charcoal Folio Case for $65: Paperlike is known for its screen protector, but the company also offers a great case. It's designed to feel like a sketchbook, complete with a polyester fabric cover that feels lightweight and high-quality. You can also prop your iPad up at two different levels. It doesn't come with an Apple Pencil slot, but there is a large flap closure that keeps it from falling out. I tested it with the iPad Air, but it's also available for the iPad Pro (both sizes).\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub for $60: Ports are limited regardless of the iPad model. This hub from Twelve South has an 85-watt USB-C port with passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI, and a headphone jack. If you have trouble fitting it on an iPad with a case, the included socket-USB-C-to-plug-USB-C cable will fix this.\nApple Magic Trackpad (USB-C) for $129: For a spacious trackpad, the Magic Trackpad 2 is a great choice. Instead of physical buttons, it has Force Touch sensors where you can feel different levels of pressure on the pad. With support for various iPadOS gestures, you won't have to touch the screen as much. It automatically pairs with your iPad via Bluetooth and recharges with the Lightning port.\nLogitech K380 Bluetooth Keyboard for $40: If you prefer an external keyboard, it's hard to go wrong with the Logitech K380. It's lightweight and portable and can be connected to up to three devices via Bluetooth (with dedicated buttons to switch between them). The keyboard is powered by AAA batteries, which lasted us around four months, so you don't have to worry about carrying a charger around.\nTwelve South HoverBar Duo 2.0 for $80: The HoverBar serves two purposes. You can mount it to the side of your bed, kitchen counter, or shelf (to view content comfortably and hands-free), or you can use the included stand at your desk. With the 2nd-gen version, you can now remove the arm from the clamp and attach it directly to the stand, making it easier to swap between both modes."

      "text": "The Best Samsung Phones\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThere's the iPhone, and then there are Samsung Galaxy phones\u2014those are the two most popular phone brands in the US. But whereas Apple is the sole company behind the iOS mobile operating system, even the best Samsung phones face stiff competition in the Android world. (And yes, Galaxy phones are Android phones, though Samsung calls its layer over Android \u201cOne UI.\u201d)\nGoogle's Pixel phones are my favorite Android devices, but Samsung's offerings are just as great and often have better hardware. Alongside Google, Samsung promises the longest software support for its cheap and high-end devices. That means you don't have to upgrade your phone as often, as it will stay up-to-date, secure, and free of bugs for longer. But the Korean giant has many, many models at varying prices. What's the best Samsung phone? I sort it out here, starting with the Galaxy S25. I also have tips and tricks to get the most out of your shiny new hardware.\nCheck out our mobile guides, including the Best Samsung Galaxy S25 Cases, Best Galaxy S24 Cases, Best Android Phones, Best Cheap Phones, Best Pixel Phones, and Best Folding Phones.\nUpdated July 2025: We've added the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7 and mentioned the Flip7 FE.\nWhy Buy Samsung?\nThe best part of being in the world of Android is choice of hardware. Want a phone with a headphone jack? Sure! Want a gaming phone with two USB-C ports? Why not. Want a phone that fast-charges in around 30 minutes? It exists. So why stick with the stalwart Samsung?\nIn my experience and research, Samsung's smartphones have a track record of reliability, and because it's a major player, it has a wider network of authorized repair centers than competing Android manufacturers. Yes, I remember the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco and even the issues with the first-gen Galaxy Fold, but Samsung now has a customer satisfaction score equal to Apple, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. That said, I haven't read great things about the company's US customer support team.\nWith its flagship phones, you're getting top-of-the-line specs and exceptional build quality with long software support. I primarily pick Pixel phones over Samsung because I prefer Google's software experience, but there are plenty of people who like Samsung's take on Android. As always, keep an open mind and consider all the other options available to you.\nIs Now the Best Time to Buy?\nYes. Samsung's Galaxy S25 series arrived early in the year, and it also has debuted most of its budget phones for 2025. The Galaxy Z Fold7 and Flip7 also just launched in July. It's worth keeping the company's launch time frames in mind if you only want the latest and greatest.\n- The flagship Galaxy S series launches at the start of the year during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event. The Galaxy S25 series, for example, was announced on January 22 and launched on February 7.\n- The budget Galaxy A series typically arrives in the spring (April or May). There are several A series phones so, they usually dribble out during the first few months of the year. This year, there's the Galaxy A16, A26, A36, and A56.\n- The folding Galaxy Z series have always launched in the summer, and this year's event was on July 9, where the company unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold7, Z Flip7, and Z Flip7 FE.\n- The midrange Galaxy FE series is the \u201cFan Edition,\u201d but this is more or less a slightly cheaper variant of the Galaxy S series. It typically launches in the fall, around late September or October. Expect to see a Galaxy S25 FE soon.\nConsider these dates as you shop, because you may want to hold off and wait for the new model, or it can help inform you on when to expect the best discounts.\nHow Long Are Samsung Phones Supported?\nAndroid phones used to have disastrously poor software support. Two years after you bought your $1,000 phone, it would no longer receive software updates. Thankfully, Google began promising longer software update cycles to its Pixel phones, which ended up pushing Samsung to match it.\nThe following Samsung phones will receive seven years of software updates from their release date, which includes Android operating system updates and monthly security patches. The latter keep your phone secure, and new OS versions can bring new features to your phone.\n- Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, Galaxy S25 Edge, and Galaxy S25 Ultra\n- Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and Galaxy S24 FE\n- Galaxy Z Fold7, Galaxy Z Flip7, Galaxy Z Flip7 FE, Galaxy Z Fold6, and Galaxy Z Flip6\nSamsung's latest Galaxy A-series phones, from the A16 and up, will receive six years of updates. Most other older Samsung devices, like some in the Galaxy A series or older flagships, will receive four years of OS updates and five years of security patches starting from the date of release. Some of this varies, as Samsung has kept changing its policy year over year, but there's a little more helpful information here.\nTo find out if your Samsung phone has a pending update, go to Settings > Software update > Download and install. It should check for any updates and download them, then you'll see an option to install it. Make sure you back up your phone before installing any update. We have a guide here.\nWhy I Recommend Buying Unlocked\nMost people buy phones directly from their carrier, but if you're reading this guide, I suggest you buy an unlocked smartphone. When you buy a carrier phone, it's \u201clocked\u201d to that network. That means if you want to switch carriers, like move from Verizon to T-Mobile, you'll have to ask your carrier to unlock the device, and this can be a huge headache. (Especially if you're traveling and want to use an international SIM card.) Asking a carrier to unlock a phone usually has a few requirements, like making sure your device is paid off or waiting for a set period of time. Unlocked phones, on the other hand, don't have this problem. You're free to use whatever carrier you want, whenever.\nCarriers also mask the true cost of a smartphone. AT&T may entice you with a $36 per month payment for a shiny new Samsung flagship, when in reality, that means you're paying $1,300 on a smartphone over 36 months. Did you really want to spend that much? Or will a cheaper phone suffice? Also, you're more likely to get software updates faster as they come directly from Samsung, and there's often far less preinstalled bloatware to deal with.\nAll to say, buy unlocked! You can buy unlocked Galaxy phones directly from Samsung and most third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.\nThe Settings to Change on Your New Samsung Phone\nSamsung has an annoying habit of announcing a bunch of cool new features with its smartphones, then leaving them turned off by default. If you've never fiddled around with your phone's settings, there's a good chance there are a lot of fun and helpful features you're not using.\nThis can include things like changing the navigation from onscreen buttons to gesture navigation, adding the battery percentage icon next to the battery bar, or keeping the always-on display turned on instead of requiring a tap on the screen. Good news for you! As I routinely switch phones, I drummed up a list of the most important settings to change when you get a Samsung phone. Read it here. Pro tip: I personally can't stand using Samsung's default keyboard, so I almost always change it to Google's Gboard instead.\nExplaining the Galaxy S25 and Qi2\nQi2 is the new wireless charging standard\u2014it takes a page from Apple's MagSafe technology and embeds magnets directly into the smartphone, allowing it to connect to accessories and chargers magnetically, even the same ones available for iPhones. That has the potential to increase the compatibility of accessories across devices, which is a good thing. The magnets ensure precise charging, so you never worry about a misaligned phone that won't charge, it offers better efficiency, and can potentially charge faster. We have more details in our Qi2 explainer here.\nConfusingly, Samsung's newest flagship phones are \u201cQi2 Ready\u201d and technically not true Qi2 smartphones. This means that they have the capability to support Qi2 if paired with a magnetic case, but alone, the S25 series do not have built-in magnets. It's disappointing and creates more confusion, and already I've encountered some cases with varying degrees of magnetic strength, and some cases don't quite work with basic Qi wireless charging stands. Read our deep dive into \"Qi2 Ready\" for more. And check out our Best Galaxy S25 Cases guide too.\nQualcomm Snapdragon vs. Exynos Chipsets\nA Samsung phone sold in the US may not be the same as a Samsung phone sold in the UK. That's because Samsung's Galaxy S series flagship phones have long relied on two different processors. Devices sold in the US and select markets are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, whereas other regions have Samsung's homegrown Exynos chipsets. Recently, Samsung has opted to use Qualcomm chips globally, though even in the US, some cheaper Samsung phones employ Exynos.\nThe gap isn't as wide between these processors anymore, but there have been issues in the past. Exynos chips tended to overheat a few years ago, though they sometimes offer slightly better battery life than their Qualcomm counterparts. It even greatly impacted camera quality too as the chip handles the image processing. Again, none of this is as big of an issue as it used to be, but it's worth keeping in mind as you shop.\nOther Samsung Phones to Consider\nIf you don't see a Samsung phone mentioned in this guide, that might be because it's not sold in the US and is a little harder to source for testing. But here are a few other Samsung phones I've tried to consider.\nSamsung Galaxy A36 5G for $400: The Galaxy A36 (6/10, WIRED Review) doesn't quite measure up to its peers from Nothing and Motorola. Performance is just too choppy, and that's not acceptable at this price. It's manageable\u2014it's not so slow that it will frustrate\u2014but you can do better. If your needs are very minimal, it's an OK phone, and the camera system is good, with day-long battery life, a nice AMOLED screen, and 6 years of software updates.\nSamsung Galaxy A16 for $175: Samsung's Galaxy A16 still doesn't reach the highs of the Galaxy A14, and that's largely due to sluggish performance. Sure, Samsung is promising six years of software updates, but that remarkable update window doesn't matter when the phone is frustratingly slow, and you want to throw it out the window. If you barely plan on using this device but want something from a reliable brand that will stay secure, the Galaxy A16 is fine. Its performance just isn't competitive with other similarly priced phones.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold6 for $1,900 or Galaxy Z Flip6 for $900: If you don't want to pay a premium for a new folding phone, then consider last year's Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip7 (7/10, WIRED Review). The Fold6 has a close to \u201cnormal\u201d smartphone experience on the exterior 6.3-inch screen. Open the phone up and there's a vast 7.6-inch AMOLED screen staring at your face, turning this folding phone into a tiny tablet. The Flip6 isn't as nice as the newer Flip7\u2014the bigger and brighter cover screen on the latest model is a step up\u2014but it's worth considering over the new Galaxy Z Flip7 FE. Technically, it's nearly identical to that phone, but the FE uses a Samsung Exynos chip instead of a Qualcomm processor, and performance may not be as smooth. The main drawback? Battery life isn't great.\nIf you're looking to save some cash, it's fine to buy Samsung's Galaxy S23 range or the Galaxy S23 FE from 2023, as long as the prices are a good deal lower than the original MSRP. (They're hard to find at most major retailers.) These phones will still get support for a while, and they're pretty great. I don't think it's worth buying anything older.\nShould You Invest in Samsung\u2019s Ecosystem?\nSamsung is one of the few smartphone manufacturers that can match Apple in its hardware ecosystem. Not only does the company make smartphones, but you can also expand your experience by adding on a Galaxy Watch8 smartwatch, Galaxy Buds3 Pro earbuds, Galaxy Ring fitness ring, Galaxy Tab S10+ tablet, and even a Windows-powered Galaxy laptop.\nThere are certain perks to this, like how some features on the Galaxy Ring and Watch8 are only available when paired with a Samsung phone, and its earbuds will automatically switch between Samsung devices based on what you're using. There's not much in the way of exclusive features when using a Galaxy phone with a Galaxy laptop, but features like Quick Share let you speedily send photos and documents between your devices.\nAgain, it's not necessary, and these other devices might not be the right ones for you within their respective categories, but if you're chasing hardware parity, you have that option with Samsung.\nWhat Is Galaxy AI?\nWith the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung launched \u201cGalaxy AI,\" a selection of artificial intelligence features, many of which are powered by Google's Gemini large language models. These enable smart features that may be helpful day to day, like real-time translations during phone calls, real-time transcriptions in Samsung's Voice Recorder app, the ability to summarize long paragraphs of text in the Samsung Notes app, or change a sentence's tone with the Samsung Keyboard.\nIn the Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy AI expanded to include Gemini as the default voice assistant and the ability for Gemini to work with multiple apps simultaneously. It also debuted Drawing Assist, which lets you sketch or enter a prompt and get an AI-generated image. Now, you can also use video in real-time with Gemini, even from the cover screen of the Galaxy Z Flip7.\nYou can find many of these features by heading to Settings > Galaxy AI to toggle them on or off. We have an explainer on how to limit Galaxy AI to on-device processing, too.\nWhat Is Samsung DeX?\nSamsung's DeX (short for \u201cdesktop experience\u201d) launched in 2017, and it's a way to plug in your Samsung phone to an external monitor and trigger a desktop version of the Android OS, all completely powered by the phone. You can find a list of compatible Samsung phones here\u2014the Flip7 is the first Galaxy Flip to support DeX\u2014and you'll need a monitor, mouse, and keyboard, plus a cable to connect the phone to the monitor. (You can also cast DeX to select screens wirelessly.)\nWhen in DeX mode, you can resize Android apps and have them all open in separate windows. It's a proper computing platform, though you probably won't want to use this as a permanent laptop replacement or anything of the sort. It's great if you're visiting another office, or working out of a coffee shop or airplane (if you have a portable display). We have a whole guide to setting up and using DeX here.\nHow I Test Phones\nI've been reviewing smartphones for a decade, but one of my earliest smart devices was a Samsung Galaxy Captivate, which I got for \u201cfree\u201d from my carrier at the time. After working during college, I finally saved enough cash for a Galaxy S3, my first flagship. I've spent years using Samsung phones in my personal life and began reviewing them for work not too long after.\nWith each Samsung smartphone, I always put my personal SIM card inside and spend as long as I can (a few weeks) using the phone as my own. I do camera testing and compare the results with similarly priced devices, I benchmark performance and play graphically demanding games to see how they fare, I try out all the new features and even take calls to make sure that ol\u2019 function still works fine.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

      "text": "The Best Android Phones\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThe best Android phone means something different to everyone\u2014it's hard to find one that caters to every need. But chances are there's a new smartphone that comes close to what you're looking for. From the bottomless pit of phone choices, my favorite Android handsets include the Google Pixel 9a, Pixel 10, and Samsung Galaxy S25. All the phones we've selected have advantages, and I've laid them out here based on extensive testing.\nSee our other mobile buying guides for more, like the Best iPhones, Best Cheap Phones, Best Samsung Phones, Phones With a Headphone Jack, Best Pixel Phones, and Best Folding Phones.\nUpdated August 2025: We've added the Google Pixel 10 series.\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy?\nYes. Many of the phones in this guide are the latest models we've tested. Prices of smartphones, laptops, and tablets may start creeping up over the coming months due to tariffs. Apple's upcoming iPhones, for example, are slated to get a price bump, and Samsung jacked the price of its latest folding phone. It's an evolving situation, but it's smart to buy a new smartphone sooner than later (if you need to upgrade).\nBuy an Unlocked Phone\nWe recommend unlocked phones in this guide. When a phone is sold as unlocked, that means it can be used on multiple wireless carriers and networks. When you go into a carrier store and buy a phone, usually on a payment plan, it often comes locked to that network, and they'll try to get you to pay for a host of unnecessary accessories and features.\nCarriers are legally required to unlock a phone upon request so you can switch networks, but it's a big hassle and they may have terms about how long you have to wait to ask. Try to pay full price for your phone, or make sure it specifically says it's unlocked. Buy it from the manufacturer or a third-party retailer directly, or investigate your carrier's policies for unlocking phones if they're bought on a payment plan that requires you to use its network. An unlocked phone is less of a hassle when you travel and want to switch to an international SIM card too.\nAndroid Specs to Look For\nIf none of the smartphones in this guide strike your fancy and you want to keep looking, here are a couple of things to keep in mind as you shop.\nDisplay: Gone are the days of shoddy phone displays\u2014almost every smartphone uses an OLED panel now. Cheaper phones still use LCD, which won't have as deep blacks and poppy colors, but even phones under $300 can sport OLED. You'll see some variations, like AMOLED or Dynamic AMOLED 2X, but that's mostly marketing jargon.\nScreen size: You hold a smartphone all the time, so make sure whatever you pick is the right size for your palms. Most small Android phones are around 6.1 to 6.3 inches (measured diagonally), whereas larger phones typically top out at 6.8 or 6.9 inches.\nProcessor: Most smartphones are powered by a Qualcomm or MediaTek processor. Google phones use the company's in-house Tensor chip, and some Samsung phones utilize Samsung's Exynos processor in select markets. It's difficult to say how reliably a processor will perform without looking at reviews and benchmark results, so do your research. If you're after reliable performance, try to stick to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7 series or higher, or MediaTek's Dimensity 7000 series or higher.\nRAM: You'll at the very least want a phone with 6 GB of RAM, though 8 GB would be better. This will let you juggle multiple apps much more seamlessly. If you want to future-proof your device, opting for 12 or 16 GB will likely allow you to better access new and upcoming artificial intelligence features, though it depends on the manufacturer and how well they support their devices.\nCooling: Good-performing phones can be ruined if they get too hot because then the processor gets throttled, causing slowdowns. This mostly applies to folks who game a lot, but it's worth checking whether there's a dedicated cooling system on the phone. You'll want to look for language like \u201cheat pipes\u201d or \u201cvapor chamber cooling.\u201d\nRefresh rate: Most phones used to come with 60-Hz refresh rates, meaning the display refreshed 60 frames per second. Nowadays, even cheap phones offer 90- or 120-Hz screens. The more frames refreshed in a second, the more fluid everything looks and feels. It might sound small, but it can make a big difference in your smartphone feeling buttery smooth. We have a broader guide that explains this technology further. Flagship phones have screens with variable refresh rates that range from 1 to 120 Hz, meaning they're often more battery efficient (look for LTPO or LTPS).\nBattery capacity: Smartphone batteries are measured in milliampere-hours (mAh). A big battery doesn't necessarily mean better battery life, because much depends on the size of the screen and other technologies the phone is powering. Most phones should have 4,000-mAh cells or higher, and you typically won't see anything higher than 5,500 mAh. Some phones now have silicon-carbon batteries, a new technology that allows them to be denser but thinner\u2014the OnePlus 13, for example, has a 6,000-mAh battery but is slimmer than many of its peers.\nCharging speeds: Most Android smartphones can charge fast, but certain companies offer shockingly fast recharge times. That's usually because they have a proprietary charging brick you'll need to use. You can find charging speed information on a phone's product spec page. OnePlus phones are famous for recharging fully within around 30 minutes. Just remember that these days, most smartphones do not come with a charging brick, just a cable. We have more details in this fast charging guide.\nSoftware updates: Software support is crucial. It means your phone will stay secure for longer and you'll get new features over time. The gold standard in Android is seven years right now, thanks to Samsung and Google. However, if you have a cadence of replacing your phone every two or three years, then the lesser update policies of other Android phone makers might not be as big of a deal to you.\nCameras: Camera specs are very misleading. A phone with a 108-megapixel sensor doesn't mean it will take better photos than a phone with a 50-MP sensor. The only way to really know is to look at reviews. What you can do, if the camera is important to you, is check if there's a versatile system. The best camera phones offer a primary wide camera, an ultrawide, and a telephoto zoom (usually at 5X zoom). Cheap phones tend to come with a lot of cameras, many of which are useless.\nExtra features: It's important not to overlook the smaller features you may expect. Does the phone have a near-field communication sensor (NFC) so you can make contactless payments? Does it have a good IP rating that can survive a drop in the pool? You'll want IP68! Is there wireless charging (Qi2 or Qi?)? What about a microSD card slot or headphone jack? Make sure you vet the phone's tech specs if you're after something specific.\n5G service: Most smartphones support 5G now, the current generation of network connectivity. If the phone you're looking at doesn't support 5G\u2014don't fret! 4G LTE isn't going anywhere yet. Don't feel pressured to upgrade to a 5G phone. You do need a 5G-enabled smartphone if you want to make use of 5G speeds. It's available in phones as cheap as $200.\nHow to Switch Between Phones\nThe best way to switch phones is to follow the setup prompts when you first boot up your new device\u2014make sure you transfer data from an old phone via a cable. It's much faster than doing it wirelessly, though that's an option too. Some manufacturers, like Samsung, will suggest you download a proprietary data transfer app on your old device, like Smart Switch, and you should. It means less work for you\u2014whether it's fewer apps you need to sign into or fewer icons you need to rearrange. If you're coming from an iPhone, you can use Google's official Android Switch app, though it's not necessary if you are switching to a Samsung phone.\nCheck out our tips on setting up your new Android phone for more, and our steps on how to back up an Android and how to factory reset it.\nHow We Test Smartphones\nI put my personal SIM card in every smartphone I test and use it for at least a week, if not two or three. I stress-test performance by playing mobile games and running benchmark tests, like Geekbench and Antutu, while also monitoring thermals. I make calls to test the smartphone's microphone quality, since, you know, it's still a phone.\nI often do camera testing by bringing a competing phone along and analyzing photos side by side on a larger, more color-accurate screen. I've been reviewing smartphones for close to a decade\u2014not just the flagship devices either. I'm always testing cheap phones to see what innovations are trickling down.\n| Compare phones | Price (MSRP) | Display | Processor and RAM | Storage | Battery |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Best Overall: Google Pixel 9a | $499 | 6.3-inch, 120-Hz, OLED | Tensor G4, 8 GB RAM | 128, 256 GB | 5,100 mAh |\n| Smartest Phones: Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL | $799+ | 6.3-inch, 6.3-inch, and 6.8-inch, 120-Hz LTPO, OLED | Tensor G5, 12 or 16 GB RAM | 128, 256, 512 GB, and 1 TB | 4,970, 4,870, and 5,200 mAh |\n| Best Flagships: Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, Galaxy S25 Ultra | $800+ | 6.2-inch, 6.7-inch, 6.9-inch, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, 12 GB RAM | 128, 256, 512 GB, and 1 TB | 4,000, 4,900, and 5,000 mAh |\n| Best Battery Life: OnePlus 13 | $900 | 6.82-inch 120-Hz LTPO, OLED | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, 12 GB RAM | 256 and 512 GB | 6,000 mAh |\n| Best Under $400: Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G | $400 | 6.7-inch, 120-Hz, AMOLED | Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, 8 GB RAM | 256 GB | 5,000 mAh |\n| Best Aesthetic: Nothing Phone (3) | $799 | 6.67-inch, 120-Hz, AMOLED | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, 12 or 16 GB RAM | 256 and 512 GB | 5,150 mAh |\n| Best Small Phone: Motorola Razr Ultra | $1,300 | Internal: 7-inch, 165-Hz LTPO, AMOLED, 120 Hz.

We like the ones below, but you'll be better off with one of the options above. If you haven't yet done so, check out our Best Cheap Phones and Best Folding Phones guides for more.\nGoogle Pixel 9 series for $599+: The Pixel 9 series (9/10, WIRED Recommends) from 2024 is still a great buy if you can find them on sale. The Pixel 9 is similar to the Pixel 9a but with better build quality and larger camera sensors. The Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL have the 5X optical camera and the vapor chamber cooling, among other perks. The key is to make sure you avoid paying MSRP. These have dipped fairly often in price during sale events, and now, as stock gets cleared, you can probably find a killer deal if you hold out.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip7 for $1,100: Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) got some great upgrades over its predecessor, but it wasn't enough to dethrone the Razr Ultra 2025 as my top flip phone pick. Still, it's worth considering if you're shopping for a folding phone of this category, because the cameras are solid, the displays are excellent and larger than ever, and the cover screen is a little more useful (though not as versatile as on Motorola's phone). Battery life is even worse here over the Fold7, so snag a power bank while you're at it.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge for $950: Samsung's latest innovation is to slim down the smartphone to an amazingly thin 5.8 mm. That's not as impressive as phones from the past, but the Galaxy S25 Edge (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is still impressive when you hold this lightweight 6.7-inch phone in your hand. It maintains several features from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, except there's no S Pen stylus, no telephoto cameras whatsoever, and battery life is not good at all for a phone of this size and price. I routinely had to keep it topped up throughout the day. But if you're an average to light user, you may find it sufficient, and maybe you'll be able to appreciate the thin and light size even more.\nNothing Phone (3a) for $379 and Phone (3a) Pro for $459: Here's another well-rounded smartphone that doesn't have an exorbitant price. The Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are sub-$500 Android phones, and they are both fantastic. They're identical in every way except the cameras, where the Pro model has a slight advantage in zoom and low-light capabilities. I think the Phone (3a) looks nicer and is a better value. Run through the list of specs and you'll be hard-pressed to find fault with the hardware. The display is wonderfully smooth with its 120-Hz refresh rate, and it's no struggle to see in the sun. Performance is snappy, battery life is reliable, and the camera quality is decent for the money. There are some drawbacks\u2014these phones are only IP64-rated, so don't drop them in the pool. There's no wireless charging, and connectivity isn't seamless. While it'll work best on T-Mobile, you'll only get 4G on Verizon and AT&T until you ask the carriers to whitelist the device for 5G access. That process is sure to be frustrating.\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE for $650: Samsung's Galaxy S24 FE is a better buy now that the flagship Galaxy S24 series is harder to find for sale. It's a perfectly capable smartphone with a triple-camera array (including a 3X telephoto camera), and it delivers good performance. It has wireless charging, is IP68 water resistant, and has solid day-long battery life. It's a shame the design\u2019s a bit drab. It's worth pointing out that we're coming up on a year since the S24 FE launched, so expect an S25 FE real soon.\nMotorola Moto G Power 2025 for $300: The new Moto G Power (7/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't as great as its predecessor, and that comes down to one reason: Due to a lesser chipset, there's a slight hit in performance, and it feels a bit more sluggish to use. However, the performance is good enough that you won\u2019t feel frustrated. Outside of this, it's a remarkable $300 phone. The green faux leather back exudes luxury, and it's nice and slim. The cameras are solid, and the 6.8-inch LCD screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate and gets plenty bright. Best of all, the company retained the wireless charging it debuted in last year's model, making it one of the only sub-$300 phones with this convenience. Another area of improvement? It's IP68/69-rated, so you won't have to baby this phone near a pool; it can handle a dip just fine. Motorola has also extended software updates on the Moto G series, promising two Android OS upgrades, with the same three years of security updates. There's a fair amount of bloatware, but you can remove most of these preinstalled apps.\nMinimal Phone for $399: Having trouble curbing your screen time? Instead of going cold turkey with something like the Light Phone III, try the Minimal Phone (6/10, WIRED Review). This is an e-paper Android phone with a physical keyboard. The goal is to let you access the usual Android apps, but because the screen is ill-suited to videos and most social media, you'll naturally be able to avoid those distractions. It's successful in this task, but the constant screen ghosting and plasticky build dampen the experience.\nMobile Accessories You Might Need\nWe have case recommendations for a few popular devices, like Samsung's Galaxy S25, Galaxy S24, and Galaxy S23, or Google's Pixel 9 series. It's smart to slap a case on these glass sandwiches and even a screen protector to keep the display free of scuffs and scratches. Here are a few other noteworthy accessories, including charging adapters, which many phones don't include anymore. Read our Best USB-C Cables guide for other recommendations.\nAnker 45-Watt Charger for $28: This tiny charger will be enough for most people to charge most smartphones. It's compact, reliable, and cheap, plus the prongs fold up. More smartphones than ever can go up to 45-watt charging speeds, so take advantage with a 45-watt charger.\nCounterpart Retractable The Charger for $44: It's not the best value, but this design-forward charger has a retractable 4-foot cable that makes it a fantastic two-in-one\u2014no need to pack a separate charger and cable! It outputs 35 watts, which is plenty to fast-charge most phones and tablets, and the prongs fold in for travel.\nPeak Design Samsung and Pixel Everyday Case for $50: If you have a Samsung or Pixel phone and you frequently mount your phone to a bike or scooter, you owe it to yourself to snag this case and Peak Design's bike mount. The case snaps perfectly into the mount, is dead simple to release, and has yet to fall off after years of riding. Peak Design also sells several other accessories you can attach to the back of these cases, bringing Android into Apple's MagSafe ecosystem.\nNimble Champ Portable Charger 10,000 mAh for $60: This portable battery is small enough to leave in a bag but has enough power to fully recharge your phone once or twice. There's a USB-C and USB-A port; it delivers 18 watts of power, so it can recharge your tablet or phone, and it's housed in 73 percent post-consumer plastic with plastic-free packaging.\nNomad ChargeKey V2 for $29: When your phone dies, it's almost always when you forget to bring a charger or battery pack. The ChargeKey is a nifty solution\u2014it's like clipping a tiny USB-C charging cable to your keychain. Just plug one end into your phone and the other into any kind of power source (a friend's phone or a charging adapter if you manage to find one), and you can top up your phone. Native Union also has a similar item that's cuter but nearly as capable.\nChoose a Wireless Charger: Our guide to the best wireless chargers includes dozens of models in varying colors, shapes, and materials, and even some designed for specific phones. Not every Android phone supports wireless charging, but it's a luxury you'll want to take advantage of. Take a gander at our guide for our favorites.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

      "text": "The Best Tablets for Work and Play\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThe best tablet can be a portable TV screen around the house and a way to get light work done away from your desk. Tablets are not essential but are nice to have around. With a wealth of apps for drawing, painting, and making music, they\u2019re also a great outlet for creative impulses.\nThe iPad\u2019s ease of use and best-in-breed software make it the obvious choice for most people\u2014that's why our top pick is the 2025 iPad with A16\u2014but if you don\u2019t want an Apple tablet, there are other options. Android tablets have made a comeback in the past couple of years. Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets are also an affordable way to watch movies and browse the web, as long as you don\u2019t mind their limitations. There are even great E Ink slates for jotting down notes or sketching. We've tested dozens of tablets over the years, and these are the best right now.\nCheck out our other guides, including the Best iPads, Best Android Tablets, Best Digital Notebooks, Best Drawing Tablets, Best Kids' Tablets, Best iPad Accessories, and Best Fire Tablets.\nUpdated July 2025: We\u2019ve added the OnePlus Pad 3, Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3, and Idea Tab Pro.\nDo You Actually Need a Tablet?\nIt depends! If you already have a laptop and a smartphone, it could feel redundant. But if your family member or loved one is hogging the TV, it's nice to be able to hold a big screen in your lap and catch up on your favorite shows, and even bring it along to every room in the house. Some tablets with accessories like keyboard covers and styli are also capable of handling some work and might make great travel computers. While some people may be able to fully replace their laptop with them, it's not for everyone.\nThings to Consider When Shopping for a Tablet\nDisplay size: The biggest factor to consider when shopping is size. Tablets usually range between 8- and 14-inch screens, with common sizes falling somewhere in the middle. A 14-inch screen might sound great until you start carrying it everywhere. It's big, and using the touchscreen can be unwieldy. I prefer tablets around 10 inches because the screen is large enough to feel distinct from my phone and it's not painful to operate.\nKid-friendly tablets: Is this tablet for a kid? You may want to take a look at Amazon's Fire HD Kids tablets as they come with a thick case and Amazon offers a worry-free two-year warranty\u2014if they break the tablet in that time, Amazon will send you a new one no questions asked. However, if you want to stick with an iPad or Android tablet instead, you can often set these devices up for kids out of the box, with parental controls and app restrictions. We have a guide on parental controls and screen time limits for Apple, Google, and Microsoft accounts.\nCellular connectivity: Do you need your tablet constantly connected to the internet, even when you're out and about? Typically only midrange and high-end tablets have the option of cellular connectivity (you'll have to pay for a data plan through your carrier). If you're planning on using it for work, then it might be a good idea, but you can always try and rely on the coffee shop's Wi-Fi network (just make sure it's secure). If you're only away from Wi-Fi for a few moments while using the tablet, consider turning your smartphone into a hotspot. It might not be as fast, but it's cheaper and does the job.\nAccessories: Some tablets have a much bigger accessory ecosystem than others. iPads have so many cool accessories that enhance the tablet experience, some of which are universal, but you won't find as many purpose-built accessories for Android or Windows tablets. Keep an eye on what the tablet manufacturer offers\u2014likely a folio case, keyboard cover, or stylus.\nSoftware support: A tablet is like a laptop\u2014you're not upgrading it every year, more so once every four to five years. That's why software updates matter. Apple supports its iPads the longest, though some features may not be available to certain models. Still, it helps maintain the device's security and keeps it bug-free. Samsung has lengthy update cycles too, though not nearly as long as Apple. Keep a look out for this as you shop.\niPadOS vs. Android\nThe two prevailing tablet operating systems are Apple's iPadOS and Android. iPads are much more common in this space because Apple has been iterating on the software for more than a decade. Google, on the other hand, has had a spotty relationship with tablets\u2014it came out the gate strong and then all-but abandoned development for bigger screens until very recently. There's renewed interest in Android tablets as the software experience is much better and optimized for bigger displays. Some Android tablet makers even have desktop modes that try to simulate a laptop experience, like Samsung's DeX mode.\nIf you're already in Apple's ecosystem and own an iPhone, MacBook, or Apple Watch, an iPad is a no-brainer. Apple's hardware complement each other\u2014like how you can wirelessly use an iPad as an external monitor with a MacBook. And even if you use an Android phone or Windows desktop, an iPad still offers the best tablet experience. However, if you hate iPadOS (or Apple), or just want to stick with the same Android app ecosystem as your smartphone, the multitasking experience has improved and there are a few great Android tablets to consider.\nOther Tablets to Consider\nWe test tons of tablets every year. Here are a few others we like, just not as much as our picks above.\nLenovo Tab Plus for $272: There are a lot of cheap Android tablets on the internet, and I urge you to be careful with what you buy. If Amazon's Fire tablets don't interest you (see below), consider Lenovo's Tab Plus. I used it for a month for pure entertainment. The 11.5-inch screen is nice and big compared to a phone screen, yet it's portable enough for travel. The built-in kickstand is excellent and should be standard on all tablets. It's not the snappiest, but the performance was more than adequate. While the software is largely fine, on rare occasions, a few preinstalled apps caused full-screen ads to pop up on the screen (one was for \u201cvirus protection\u201d). It's crazy that Lenovo would allow that kind of garbage to show up, but the easy fix is to uninstall all the bloatware.\nOnePlus Pad 2 for $550: OnePlus is still selling the Pad 2, which is the 2024 tablet and predecessor to the current Pad 3. The 12.1-inch screen isn't as big, and performance is a small step below due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset inside. Still, that's plenty powerful to handle most apps and games. You'll have a hard time finding accessories (like the keyboard), but if the Pad 3 is too pricey, this one's not a bad buy.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus for $550: The Galaxy Tab S9 FE is the \u201cFan Edition\u201d version of the flagship Tab S9 series, meaning it makes some sacrifices for a more palatable price. It now has a successor\u2014the Tab S10 FE series\u2014but I haven't tested it yet. The S9 FE comes in a Plus and standard variant\u2014I tested the former\u2014and both include a stylus. It performed much better than the older Tab S7 FE tablet with fewer stutters. The 12.4-inch LCD screen is large and a rarity to find at this price in the Android world, but it's a bit tricky to comfortably hold, especially when browsing apps in bed. It has dipped to $400, so try to catch it on sale. At $550, you may as well buy the newer Tab S10 FE.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 Series for $576+: The 2023 Galaxy Tab S9 series (7/10, WIRED Recommends) consists of three tablets: the Tab S9, Tab S9+, and Tab S9 Ultra. They're all expensive, though prices have come down since their release (the Ultra is no longer available). The hardware is still excellent, and considering the newer Tab S10 series isn't dramatically different, the Tab S9 series is still worth a look. They sport superbright 120-Hz screens and IP68 water resistance, and Samsung includes the S Pen stylus.\nHonor MagicPad 2 for \u00a3400: This classy tablet is also not currently sold in the US. Quite similar to the OnePlus Pad 2 we recommend above, it boasts a truly gorgeous OLED display with impressive specs (3K resolution, 1,600 nits, 144-Hz refresh rate) that are generally unavailable at this price. Paired with the eight speakers, watching movies and gaming on this tablet is a pleasure. The stylus and keyboard are great (I love the handwriting and formula recognition), but they don\u2019t seem to be available in the UK. I found Honor\u2019s AI features, like Magic Portal, which gets good at predicting what you want to do, very useful, maybe more so on a tablet than a phone. Battery life is good, and charging is speedy (66 watts). The only real weakness here is the limited processing power, which can\u2019t match something like an iPad (though you will pay a lot more for an equivalent Apple device). \u2014Simon Hill\nTablet Accessories\nTablets often don't come with kickstands or enough ports, so it's a good idea to snag a few accessories to enhance your experience. These are some of our favorite tablet accessories, many of which you can also find in our Best iPad Accessories guide.\nSatechi Aluminum Desktop Stand for $45: This is my favorite tablet stand, so much so that I've taken it with me on trips. It packs down relatively well, and it is very stable\u2014there's no wobbling around here. You can also adjust the angle quite a bit. It can handle huge sizes too\u2014it worked perfectly with my 12.9-inch iPad Pro.\nLogitech K380 Pebble Bluetooth Keyboard for $40: Want a simple Bluetooth keyboard for your tablet instead of spending half the price of your tablet on a keyboard case? I've used Logitech's K380 for years and it's functioned perfectly. It takes two AA batteries that I've yet to replace (Logitech claims two years of use), and you can switch between three connected devices via Bluetooth.\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub for $60: This works with iPads and other tablets just fine. You can either plug it in and keep it flush with the edge of a slate or use the included cord to keep it extended. You get a USB-C port you can use for pass-through charging, a USB-A, an HDMI, and a headphone jack.\nLamicall Gooseneck Tablet Holder for $20: I've used this on my bed frame to hold up various tablets for more than a year. The gooseneck requires a bit of finagling to get to the right position, and if you're constantly tapping the tablet, it will jiggle around. But it's a great hands-free way to watch movies. You can affix the clamp to any surface, like a desk or kitchen counter.\nTwelve South HoverBar Duo Mount/Stand for $80: You can use this as a stand or as an arm mount, and Twelve South makes it really easy to switch between the two. That means you can easily affix your tablet to your bedside arm mount and then put it on the stand in your home office in the morning. Both are sturdy, and the arm mount is decently adjustable. Best of all, it doesn't wiggle around as much as the Lamicall above when you tap the screen.\nAnker Nano 3 30-Watt Charging Adapter for $17: Most tablets charge at around 18 watts, so this 30-watt charger from Anker is more than capable. The plugs fold up, and it's pretty compact.\nUgreen 145-Watt Portable Charger for $70: This power bank is surprisingly compact considering its 25,000-mAh capacity. That's enough to recharge most tablets two or three times. It dishes out up to 145 watts, meaning it has plenty of power to recharge even a laptop. You can fast-charge with the USB-C ports and use the USB-A port on another device. There's a small LED that shows the battery\u2019s current charge.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

      "text": "it\u2019s no secret that Apple has mastered the art of smoke and mirrors. When the company debuted the new iPad Pro, the flashy livestreamed keynote\u2014and the hands-on event for media afterward\u2014made it seem as if the company had finally given its high-end tablet the biggest refresh in years. And this is technically true. But that\u2019s also because the bar is already set fairly low.\nThe last two iPad Pros haven\u2019t been all that innovative. In 2021, Apple added an M1 chip and a mini-LED display; in 2022, it came with an M2 and some new minor software features. The latest model, which becomes available May 15, comes with new OLED display technology, a larger 13-inch screen size, an all-new M4 chipset, and a few cosmetic tweaks. It\u2019s also thinner\u2014Apple\u2019s thinnest product ever, to be exact. It\u2019s compatible with new accessories too, including a redesigned Magic Keyboard case and the first-ever Apple Pencil Pro.\nIt\u2019s more than what we\u2019ve been given over the past two years. And I was genuinely excited about the enhancements. But hours after the event, when the adrenaline dropped, my editor looked at me and said: \u201cIf you think about it, the new changes to the iPad Pro aren\u2019t that crazy.\u201d To prove him wrong, I started to list them out loud, only to realize he was right. In the grand scheme of things, the noteworthy updates to the iPad Pro are the external changes to its hardware, ones that were expected and necessary for such a high-end tablet\u2014except for the M4 chip. But with nothing to show for its new processor just yet, aside from a speedier CPU and GPU, this iPad Pro feels half-baked.\nLight \u2018n\u2019 Bright\nInstead of recycling the same chassis as it has been doing for the past few years, Apple has finally ditched the old iPad Pro shell for an entirely new one. You\u2019ll now have the choice between the standard 11-inch display or a slightly larger 13-inch size. Apple sent me the latter to test for this review. It\u2019s not a dramatic difference. But as someone who stares at a monitor all day, I\u2019m all for any extra screen real estate. (I use the 15-inch MacBook Air as my daily driver.) If you plan on working off of the iPad Pro full-time, I\u2019d recommend the bigger size.\nApple has also upgraded the new tablet from mini-LED to OLED panels on both sizes (it was only the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that received the mini-LED treatment on the sixth-generation version). Known as Ultra Retina XDR, it uses a new display technology called Tandem OLED, consisting of two fused OLED layers, resulting in a brighter screen."

Apple Inc. overhauled the iPhone for its 10th anniversary in 2017, while Samsung Electronics Co. revamped its design with the Galaxy S10 in 2019. By contrast, Google\u2019s latest Pixel looks unchanged. Aside from new colors, the Pixel 10 Pro could easily be mistaken for last year\u2019s Pixel 9."

Learn more.\nApple's iPads have been on the back burner since 2022\u2014there have been plenty of iPhones and Macs since, even a mixed-reality headset, but it's been two years since we've seen a new tablet. Now the wait is finally over. During its virtual event today, Apple announced the next-generation iPad Pro and iPad Air, an all-new M4 chip, as well as updated accessories.\nHere's everything Apple announced.\nUpdated June 4, 2024: An earlier version of this article stated the M2 powering the iPad Air was three times faster than the A12 Bionic chip. The company has since corrected this, confirming it's three times faster than the A14 Bionic chip. We've updated the article to reflect this.\nAll-New M4 Chip\nSince 2020, Apple has exclusively launched its M-series processors alongside another Mac. That's no longer the case, as Apple unveiled the all-new M4 chipset debuting inside the new iPad Pro.\nThe new chip is built on a second-generation three-nanometer process, packing more transistors into a smaller space, enhancing both power efficiency and speed. The CPU has four performance cores and six efficiency cores, which Apple says delivers up to 50 percent faster CPU performance than the M2 in the previous iPad Pro. There's also a 10-core GPU for four times faster performance. As with the M3, it comes with features such as ray tracing, mesh shading, and dynamic caching.\nThe shift in strategy makes sense, seeing as how Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (which focuses on new software capabilities coming to its entire product line) is next month. In April, Bloomberg reported that iOS 18 will include \u201ca new slate of generative AI features\u201d and that Apple was currently in talks with OpenAI to incorporate some of the company's features into the next version of the iPhone operating system (this is in addition to reports that Apple is also talking to Google about licensing the Gemini assistant).\nDuring its earnings calls, Apple CEO Tim Cook has been hinting at the company's incoming AI features as well\u2014both in February and, more recently, earlier this month. Although Apple didn't get into AI-specific features, it's seemingly laying the AI groundwork with the new M4.\nIt's currently only available with the new iPad Pro, but we can expect Apple to implement the chip in the next-generation Macs.\nAn OLED iPad Pro\nThe last two versions of the iPad Pro haven't been all that innovative. In 2021, Apple added an M1 chip and a mini-LED display; in 2022, it came with an M2 chip, ProRes video capture, and support for Wi-Fi 6E. The latest iPad Pro, however, packs the largest number of notable upgrades we've seen in a while.\nYou'll have the choice between a 13-inch iPad Pro and the standard 11-inch. For the first time, Apple is now employing OLED panels instead of mini-LED, but this isn't just any OLED screen. Apple says its new display technology is called Tandem OLED, which is comprised of two OLED layers fused together. This results in a brighter screen, which it calls Ultra Retina XDR. OLED screens typically don't get as bright as LCDs, but Apple says these new iPads can hit 1,000 nits and 1,600 nits in peak brightness.\nThese iPads are also the thinnest Apple products ever. The 11-inch model is 5.3 mm, and the 13-inch model is 5.1 mm, which is 0.8 and 1.3 mm thinner than the 2022 iPad Pro 11-inch and 12.9-inch models, respectively. They're also quite lightweight at 0.98 and 1.28 pounds.\nYou can choose between standard or nano-texture glass (as seen on the Studio Display and Pro Display XDR) that helps to reduce glare. This is a $100 addition that is available only on the 1- or 2-terabyte iPad Pro models. Speaking of, the base storage now starts at 256 GB.\nOn the back is a 12-megapixel camera, lidar scanner, and a new adaptive True Tone flash. The latter offers improved document scanning in harsh lighting conditions, and Apple says it employs AI and stitches multiple images to deliver a nicer scan. The front-facing camera has also been moved to landscape mode.\nApple also announced new updates for its Pro video- and audio-editing apps\u2014Final Cut Pro 2 and Logic Pro 2. The former has more interesting features, such as live multicam support, which lets you connect multiple iPhones or iPads during a multicam shoot, and you can view all the feeds on one iPad and even control things like focus and white balance remotely.\nAll of these new features come with an inevitable price increase. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999, while the 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,299. It's currently available for preorder and will go on sale May 15.\nA Bigger iPad Air\nThe sixth-generation iPad Air doesn't have as many significant upgrades as the iPad Pro, but it does now come in two sizes. As with the new iPad Pro, you'll now have the choice between an 11-inch and a 13-inch screen (for 30 percent more screen real estate). That way, you don't have to shell out for the Pro version if all you want is a bigger screen without the other features. (For example, it doesn't have Apple's ProMotion, which adds a 120-Hz screen refresh rate for more fluid interactions.)\nApple kept the same design it unveiled back in 2020, complete with slim bezels, a USB-C port, and Touch ID integrated into the top button. The only difference is the selfie camera placement. As with the iPad (10th gen) and the latest iPad Pro, the 12-megapixel sensor has been moved to the center of the iPad on the Air in landscape orientation. You'll get the same 12-megapixel rear camera as on its predecessors.\nUnder the hood, Apple upgraded the M1 chip to an M2\u2014the same silicon that powers the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro (2022), and the sixth-generation iPad Pro. Compared to the M1, Apple claims the M2 is up to 50 percent faster and three times faster than the iPad Air with the A14 Bionic chip. But the increase in performance is likely incremental if you're coming from the M1. You'll likely only notice a difference if you come from an older iPad Air powered by one of Apple's A-series chips. Apple also doubled the starting storage with 128 gigabytes, and you can upgrade it all the way up to 1 terabyte.\nThe 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the 13-inch model starts at $799. It's available for preorder now and ships May 15.\nThe Apple Pencil Goes Pro\nIt seems as if Apple has always struggled to find the Goldilocks zone for the Apple Pencil. The first-generation version has a Lightning connector, so you have to remove the cap and awkwardly plug it into the iPad's charging port. The second-generation version is the most feature-packed, but it's pricey for what it is. Plus, it's also not compatible with all iPad models. And the USB-C version feels perplexing\u2014it lacks pressure sensitivity and attaches magnetically, but it doesn't support wireless charging and also doesn't work on all iPad models.\nThe latest is the Apple Pencil Pro\u2014everything is \u201cPro\u201d these days. It looks identical to its predecessor, matte finish and all, but it also comes equipped with a few new features. There's now a \u201csqueeze\u201d capability that opens up a new tool palette (double tap is still available), and the new haptic engine inside offers you feedback as you squeeze. A built-in gyroscope sensor lets you change the orientation of the tools you're using as you twist the pencil, offering up even finer control.\nAdditionally, anyone who tends to lose their Apple Pencil will be happy to know that the new version has support for Apple's Find My network. Now you can track the Pencil Pro on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac via the Find My app in case you misplace it.\nThe third-generation Apple Pencil is currently available for preorder for $129. It starts shipping on May 15. It's only compatible with the new iPad Air and new iPad Pro models. It's a little ridiculous that there's no backward compatibility, not even for someone with an iPad Pro from 2022.\nA New Magic Keyboard Case\nThe first-ever Magic Keyboard case hit shelves in 2020, but since then, third-party accessory companies like Logitech, Zagg, and Brydge have built better options that are more functional, more durable, and less expensive.\nApple's new refreshed version isn't all that different from its predecessor, but it does come with some noteworthy improvements (yet still a high price). It now includes a Function row (for access to controls like screen brightness), an aluminum palm rest, and a larger trackpad with haptic feedback\u2014so it should feel a lot similar to a MacBook. According to Apple, it's also thinner and lighter.\nIt's available for both the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro starting at $299 and $349, respectively. It's currently available for preorder and will go on sale May 15.\nOn a final note, Apple says it's lowering the price of the base 10th-generation iPad that it launched back in 2022 from $449 to $349. That means the 2019 9th-gen iPad will likely start disappearing from store shelves."
