  "title": "Controversial tennis star taunts Carlos Alcaraz in message to Emma Raducanu",
  "description": "Emma Raducanu was sent a message by a tennis star following her US Open link-up with Carlos Alcaraz.",
  "content": "Controversial tennis star Danielle Collins taunted Carlos Alcaraz as she sent a message to 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu. Alcaraz and Raducanu joined forces in the US Open mixed doubles earlier this week but failed to get past the first hurdle as they were defeated by Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula in their opening match. The mixed doubles at Flushing Meadows was revamped this year to attract the biggest stars of the singles game, with the event even branded as an \u201cexhibition\u201d because of the changes. There was a prize pot of \u00a3740,000 up for grabs, with Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori ultimately defending the title they won 12 months ago.\n\nAfter Alcaraz and Raducanu has been dumped out of the tournament, the Briton took to Instagram and wrote: \u201cCrazy!! @carlitosalcarazz. \u201cThank you partner, had so much fun.\u201d Alcaraz, who won his only US Open singles title to date in 2022, replied: \u201cStill waiting for those Spanish words. Thank you partner.\u201d And Collins jumped in with a cheeky comment as she penned: \u201cWay to carry the team Em!!!\u201d\n\nCollins also featured in the US Open mixed doubles alongside Christian Harrison, with the duo acting as late replacements for Katerina Siniakova and Jannik Sinner. Sinner withdrew from the tournament through illness hours before it got underway after retiring from the Cincinnati Open final while 5-0 down to Alcaraz in the opening set. Collins and Harrison won their opening match against Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev in New York to progress to the quarter-finals, where they overcame compatriots Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton. But they were knocked out in the last-four by Errani and Vavassori as they lost 4-2, 4-2 to the eventual champions.\n\nCollins, who is ranked at No. 59 in the world in singles, has proven to be a controversial figure at times and has clashed with the likes of Iga Swiatek and Maria Sakkari in the past. In January, she sarcastically cupped her ear and blew kisses to the Australian Open crowd after getting the better of home favourite Destanee Aiava in the second round. And after being booed by fans during her on-court interview, she exclaimed: \u201cDuring the match I was like, while I\u2019m out here I might as well take that big, fat paycheque. CoCo [Vandeweghe] and I love a good five-star vacation so part of that cheque is going to go towards that. So thank you guys, thanks for coming out here and supporting us tonight.\u201d",
