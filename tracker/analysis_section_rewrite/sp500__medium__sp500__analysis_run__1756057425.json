      "feedback": "This draft shows a credible sectoral bias and useful anchor points, but to reach world‑class quality you should (1) tighten the causal chain: explicitly map macro drivers (AI compute demand, data‑center energy use, and durable cash flows) to sector bets (semis/AI infra, high‑quality dividends, autos/EV capex) and tie each linkage to a source (STBVARD8F for Nvidia AI/50%+ capex context; 4661GWFP7 for value/low‑volatility tilts; WTNT85IPR for GM/Cadillac EV and the tariff backdrop); (2) build a formal 3– to 4‑scenario map with clear catalysts, timing windows, path dependence, and explicit invalidations: base, tariff‑risk tilt (tariff clarity Sep–Nov 2025; 25% passenger vehicle tariffs per WTNT85IPR), AI capex surprise (data‑center energy demand, 945 TWh by 2030 per STBVARD8F), and a discretionary‑demand shock (Disney/KO consumer leisure pricing signals from U3ZK13ZQI and KO dividend framework from YX2J8NHZ1); for each scenario specify triggers, thresholds, and exit/invalidation conditions; (3) quantify where possible: use Costa Coffee sale physics (£2B implied from STBVARD8F; Costa 2023 revenue £1.22B) and GM capex cadence ($10–$12B annual through 2027; $4B US manufacturing push from WTNT85IPR); tie dividend/stock picks to explicit yields and growth histories (TXN 2.7% yield; AXP, SBUX, PG around 2–3%; XOM ~3.7%; SO ~3.1%; MAA ~4.3%; SHW ~0.9% per YX2J8NHZ1); (4) replace generic narrative with a concise, source‑anchored catalyst map: for each stock/sector, specify the signal, date window, and the invalidation or reversal cue; (5) strengthen the watch list and risk signals: Nvidia/Alphabet earnings, KO Costa‑sale updates, GM EV cadence, and tariff developments as near‑term flags (STBVARD8F)(WTNT85IPR)(YX2J8NHZ1)(U3ZK13ZQI); (6) improve structure and currency: present a tight 1‑page scenario table or bullet map (base + 1–2 alts) with a 3–6 month horizon, end with base case, alts, risks, and watch‑list signals, and ensure every claim is tied to a specific source to avoid any unsupported synthesis.",
