  "description": "Billionaire claims big tech giant favours ChatGPT over his rival app",
  "content": "Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple over claims the company is refusing to put his chatbot at the top of its iPhone download charts. The billionaire said xAI, which makes the Grok app, would take \u201cimmediate legal action\u201d about what he alleged was an \u201cunequivocal antitrust violation\u201d. In particular, Mr Musk is upset that ChatGPT, made by rival tech company OpenAI, features at the top of the download store in the US and many other countries. He claimed that Apple had made it \u201cimpossible\u201d for any other AI app to surpass it. In a post on X, he wrote:\n\nHe later wrote: \u201cHey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your \u201cMust Have\u201d section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know.\u201d Apple frequently features ChatGPT in sections of the App Store that recommend new apps, and the iPhone-maker has a deal with OpenAI to provide answers on its Siri platform. However, it is unclear whether the company makes it impossible for other apps to surpass it. Less than 24 hours ago, Mr Musk had celebrated Grok briefly jumping to the top of Apple\u2019s download charts in Singapore. ChatGPT is also at the top of the rival Google Play Store\u2019s download charts. Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive, responded by saying that Mr Musk had used X, formerly known as Twitter, to benefit his own companies at the expense of his rivals. \u201cThis is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Mr Altman wrote.\n\nSince Mr Musk bought Twitter in 2022, the company\u2019s algorithm has at times been tweaked to promote his posts. Mr Musk has frequently threatened legal action against OpenAI. He helped found the company but left after a dispute with Mr Altman over its non-profit status. Last year, he sued the company over claims he was manipulated into investing. OpenAI counter-sued, accusing him of \u201cunlawful harassment\u201d. A trial is due next year. He has previously threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies due to the deal between the iPhone-maker and OpenAI, and accused Apple of censorship after the company suspended advertising on X amid an antisemitism row. The Tesla chief has also criticised Apple\u2019s App Store fees, which take up to 30pc of spending on apps, saying it is \u201clike having a 30pc tax on the internet\u201d. Apple is currently fighting an anti-monopoly lawsuit from the US government, as well as potential regulatory crackdowns in the EU and UK.",
