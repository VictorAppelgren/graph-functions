      "summary": "The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) has cut its active pathogen monitoring from eight to just two—Salmonella and Shiga toxin‑producing E. coli—effective July 1, citing funding shortfalls.  The move, announced by the CDC, may hinder early outbreak detection and trend analysis for the six omitted pathogens.  The change follows concerns that reduced surveillance could weaken food‑safety oversight and slow responses to future foodborne illness spikes.",
