      "feedback": "The analysis has a solid base but can reach world-class quality with a tighter, evidence‑driven 0–3 week framework and explicit, testable catalysts. Actionable edit plan: 1) Reframe as a crisp causal chain from Powell’s rate‑cut signal to near‑term risk‑on, linking the 85% Sep 25bp cut odds, the HK/U.S. equity reactions (Hang Seng +1.2%, Hang Seng Tech +1.8%, S&P +1.5%, Nasdaq +1.9%), and the continued rally into futures (T7HLAX8QN; 17F49LURJ). 2) Quantify every key data point and event: quote exact levels (Hang Seng 25,642.70; 1.2%/1.8% moves; S&P/Nasdaq percentages) and clearly attach them to timing (Friday rally, weekend pricing). 3) Build a structured 0–3 week scenario with explicit probability weights and precise catalysts: base case data‑driven gradual easing, bull case from softer‑than‑expected payrolls/inflation prints plus Nvidia strength, bear case from stronger data or hawkish tilt; define invalidation thresholds. 4) Enrich the catalysts/trigger set: immediate drivers (Powell Jackson Hole hint; Nvidia earnings; August payrolls and inflation prints), positioning catalysts (Evergrande delisting as China risk overlay; Santos’ LNG/Barossa/Pikka milestones as energy‑cycle ballast), and the policy‑risk overlay from Krugman’s Trump/tariffs discussion (218AGGUXB). 5) Add precise invalidation levels: e.g., if payrolls/inflation prints surprise to the upside and Sep cut odds retreat, or if Hang Seng breaks decisively below 24,000, shift to risk‑off. 6) Strengthen the reaction function: specify how flows, valuation, and liquidity translate into asset moves (e.g., energy/LNG exposure as ballast, tech as proxy for AI cycle, China risk delaying breadth). 7) Expand the monitoring checklist with concrete, time‑stamped data and named events (Powell speak/press, CPI/NFP prints, Nvidia result, Hang Seng daily close around key levels, Evergrande status). 8) Tighten first‑principles grounding and reconciliation: acknowledge the dual macro signal (policy easing vs. China/property risk) and the energy tilt from Santos as a belt‑and‑suspenders reader for LNG equities, while cleanly separating these from the Krugman/Trump‑policy narrative. 9) Ensure strict source discipline: attribute each factual claim to one of the four IDs; after the narrative insert concise mappings like Powell→T7HLAX8QN; Nvidia→17F49LURJ; Santos→S1OY7ISLY; Krugman/Trump risk→218AGGUXB; and remove any non‑source claims. 10) Consider a compact probability canvas (base 60%, bull 25%, bear 15%) to quantify uncertainty and guide next‑step positioning.
