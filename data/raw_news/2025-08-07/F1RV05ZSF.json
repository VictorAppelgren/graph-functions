      "text": "You can technically wear any earbuds or headphones while working out but some are better suited for gym use and other sporting activities, particularly when it comes to their design. Sports buds are not only sweat- and water-resistant but they often have sport fins or ear hooks to help keep them securely attached to your ears. If you prefer to stay in touch with your surroundings, I've included several earbuds with an open design, some of which clip-on on to your ears like earrings. I've tested all the earbuds and headphones on this list and will update it as new models are released. Also, for even more workout audio options, check out our best bone-conduction headphones and best true-wireless sports earbuds with ear hooks lists.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nBest earbuds and headphones for working out for 2025\nPros\n- Improved design and sound quality with smaller case\n- Equipped with more powerful H2 chip\n- Good noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Heart-rate sensors\n- Strong battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Some users may not get a tight seal\n- A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2\n- More basic Find My feature (no Precision Finding)\nIt's been almost six years since the Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019 so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. (Read our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review).\nThere are a lof of new premium earbuds with built-in ear hooks, although the majority of them, like Shokz OpenFit 2, have an open design with no ear tips, which some people prefer. I like the Shokz and some of those other open earbuds but if you're looking for ear-hook style earbuds with noise canceling and superior sound quality, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are the best right now.\nPros\n- Slightly improved design and comfort\n- Impressive sound for open earbuds\n- Improved battery life\n- New physical control button\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nShokz' second-gen OpenFit 2 has a slightly upgraded design, upgraded drivers that noticeably improve the sound quality, better battery life and a new physical control button. The changes don't seem huge on the surface but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality, with more bass and better clarity. They sound excellent for open earbuds -- at least in quieter environments.\nPros\n- Lightweight design with integrated wingtip that fits securely\n- Very good sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H1 chip\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- No enhanced Find My with proximity view (only standard Find My)\nHot on the heels of the third-generation AirPods, Apple has another new set of earbuds, this time from its subsidiary audio company, Beats. Technically, the new Beats Fit Pro aren't AirPods but they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro. Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. And for some people, they might just be better than the AirPods Pro.\nPros\n- Lightweight design, now with USB-C charging\n- Excellent sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H2 chip\n- Strong voice-calling performance\n- Support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with Apple's Vision Pro headset\nCons\n- No support for high-resolution audio with other Apple devices except headset\n- Still no XL tips included\nApple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro, Apple's wearable headset. Is it possible that new acoustic architecture makes the buds sound subtly different with current devices like the iPhone? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available.\nPros\n- Impressive sound with \"Sound by Bose\" technology that beats out competitors in the price range\n- Comfortable, secure fit with three ear tip and \"fit fin\" sizes designed to keep buds in your ears during sporting activities\n- Good battery life (40 hours total)\n- Ear-detection sensors and touch controls are well-implemented and customizable in Skullcandy-iQ app\nCons\n- Charging case is bulky and little tricky to put buds into\n- Lack the premium finish of Bose's expensive buds\n- Noise-canceling is decent but not great\n- In my voice-calling tests, Callers said they couldn't hear me well in noisy environments\nSkullcandy hyped its new Method 360 ANC earbuds (read full review) as \"the boldest audio product of 2025, featuring a partnership you didn't see coming.\" Whether the Method 360 ANC earbuds are the boldest audio product of the year is debatable but I was certainly surprised to learn that Skullcandy had joined forces with Bose to create what's essentially a budget version of Bose's $299 QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. Not only do the Method 360 ANC buds sound better than most earbuds in this price class (they sound very similar to Bose's $170 QuietComfort Earbuds), they also fit comfortably and securely. While they share many of the traits of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they're lighter and lack the more premium finish of those pricey buds. Also, their noise canceling isn't up to the QC Ultra's very high ANC standard. But it's still effective and better than the noise canceling I experienced with the previous Skullcandy earbuds I tested.\nThe Method 360 ANC's only potential major drawback is the rather large carrying case. Some people won't mind that it's bulky but others might.\nPros\n- Lightweight with a comfortable, secure fit thanks to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters and redesigned ear tips\n- Very good sound with a bass-forward, dynamic sound profile\n- Good noise canceling\n- Strong voice-calling performance with good background noise reduction\n- Built-in voice controls and Sony's Speak-To-Chat feature\n- Optional accessories available to customize the look of the buds and case\nCons\n- Overpriced at their list price\n- No wireless charging\nTruth be told, in some ways, I like the Sony's new LinkBuds Fit better than its flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-canceling earbuds. While they don't sound quite as good or have noise-canceling that's quite on par with those buds, they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is thanks to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters but Sony also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step-down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls. Read our hands-on first take.\nPros\n- Good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Good battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Voice-calling performance could be a little better\nThe well-designed OpenDots One are among the best open earbuds out there right now. While they don't sound quite as good as the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, they're pretty close and fit my ears slightly better and have better battery life. Like the Ultra Open Earbuds, which list for $299 but are currently on sale for $249, they're overpriced, but at least they cost less than the Bose and their case has wireless charging. Read review.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound with more bass\n- Good battery life\n- Well-priced\nCons\n- A little heavier than Shokz models\nAnker's Soundcore AeroFit 2 open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds, which also listed for $100. The second-gen Aerofit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements. The buds aren't as light as the Shokz OpenFit 2 buds and don't sound quite as good but they cost quite a bit less and offer good all-around performance with augmented bass response. Available in multiple colors, they're a good option for those looking for ear-hook style open earbuds with a fairly premium design and good sound quality, without the high price tag of top-end models.\nPros\n- Impressive overall performance for the price\n- Very good, slightly warm sound with slight bass push that can be tweaked in user-friendly companion app\n- Decent noise canceling and background noise reduction for voice calling\n- Support for AAC, AptX and LDAC audio codecs\n- Robust feature set (wireless charging, ear-detection sensors, multipoint Bluetooth 5.4)\nCons\n- Touch controls are a bit finicky\n- Voice-calling performance could be better in noisier environments\nEarfun is one of our go-to brands for value earbuds. Its Air Pro 4 buds aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s but they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds.\nEarfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs.\nLike their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much.\nAs I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio). I do think the voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do.\nPros\n- Upgraded design from X10\n- Secure, comfortable fit\n- Slightly better sound and noise canceling\n- Improved battery life\n- Fully waterproof and dust-proof\nCons\n- Lack a bit of clarity\n- Sound is degraded if you don't get a tight seal\nThe Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. However, they don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks.\nFully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 have slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get 5 sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. But the buds are affordable and a good value overall. As for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent though not exceptionally good.\nPros\n- Lightweight and very comfortable\n- Excellent design\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Good call quality\nCons\n- Sound quality and battery life is slightly better with step-up OpenFit model\nShokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. However, this model, like Shokz's step-up OpenFit true-wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology.\nWhile Shokz' flagship OpenFit 2 buds sound slightly better, have better battery life (up to 11 hours instead of 6 at moderate volume levels) and a physical control button, the Open Fit Air cost about $60 less and are a tad lighter and quite comfortable to wear. Available in three color options, they're lightweight (8.5 grams), comfortable and I liked how the ear hooks felt soft but had just the right amount of rigidity. They're IP54 splash-proof and dust-resistant and their charging case is fairly compact for this style of sports buds with ear hooks.\nWhile the earbuds sound quite good for open earbuds, they don't sound quite as good as a set of noise-isolating earbuds in this price range (they're a tad bass shy). Nor do they sound as good as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which do cost more and serve up a little more bass and fuller sound (the Bose also sound slightly better than Shokz Open Fit buds). Equipped with two microphones in each bud, the Open Fit Air offer good voice-calling performance. Additionally, the feature multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them to two devices simultaneously.\nPros\n- Dual-driver technology improves sound dramatically\n- Comfortable and secure open-ear design\n- Low vibration\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Limited sound leakage\nCons\n- Somwhat pricey\nThe problem with bone-conduction headphones has always been that they just don't sound all that good. That is unless you plug up your ears, which defeats the safety benefit of their open-ear design and is why they're so popular with runners and bikers. Well, that just changed. Shokz has finally cracked the code on bone-conduction sound quality with a novel dual-driver design in its new flagship OpenRun Pro 2 headphones ($180).\nWith the OpenRun Pro 2, Shokz has solved the bass deficiency issue by adding a second, more traditional speaker driver that's tasked with firing bass frequencies toward your open ears. Shokz employed that same micro-speaker technology (it calls it \"air conduction\") in its first non-bone-conduction headphones, the OpenFit ($140) and Open Fit Air ($120) true-wireless earbuds.\nPros\n- Sturdy design (IP54 water-resistant)\n- Comfortable\n- Come with a second set of ear pads for workouts\n- Good battery life\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No companion app\n- No headphone cable for wired mode with devices with headphone jacks\nWhile the BlueAnt Pump X headphones aren't going to win any awards for sound quality (they sound good but not great), they have a few things going for them as gym headphones. First, they fold up and feel sturdily built, weighing in at 295 grams (while they're not light, they're also not too heavy). Second, they're comfortable to wear and come with two sets of swappable ear pads -- the \"everyday\" set is covered with soft faux leather, while the workout set is cloth-covered and is designed to keep your ears cooler as you heat up. Finally, they're IP54 splash-proof and sweat-proof. I also liked that they feature physical control buttons, making them easy to operate, and support USB-C audio, which allows you to plug them into a USB-C-equipped smartphone, tablet or PC and use a wired connection to improve the audio quality with more clarity.\nEquipped with Bluetooth 5.4 but lacking a companion app or ear-detection sensor, their sound profile leans to the warm side. They have a bit of bass push, which some people like, and you get three modes to choose from: Transparent, Noise Cancelling and X-Mode. The latter offers the most dynamic range and volume, which is why I tended to keep it in X-Mode. Battery life is also decent at up to 58 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels with noise cancelling off. But in most other respects, as their price indicates, these are pretty much midrange headphones. In other words, don't expect to be blown away by their sound quality, noise-canceling or voice-calling performance. But they're decent across the board and make appealing gym headphones for those who like to work out in over-ear headphones.\nPros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested in the past several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open-ear design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. They're still true wireless earbuds, and at $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Decent sound\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- Somewhat generic design\nBaseus is known for its value earbuds, power banks and charging products. While its Bowie MC1 aren't in the same league as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, they cost about a sixth of the price and sound pretty decent for this style of of clip-on earbuds, particularly with less demanding tracks that don't feature heavy bass and a lot of instruments playing at the same time. On Amazon, you'll find clip-on buds with a similar design, including the Tozo OpenEarRing ($30) and Amazfit Up ($50), so they're a little generic. But I found the sound quality to be slightly better many competing clip-on value buds. I also liked that they have a single physical control button on each bud for controlling playback and adjusting volume levels.\nBattery life is rated for up to 9 hours at moderate volume levels, which is good, but expect to get les than that because you do tend to have to listen to open earbuds at higher volumes, especially in noisier environments. With an IP57 certification, the buds are splash-proof and dust-proof, making them suitable for runners and bikers. Voice-calling capabilities are also decent but don't expect business-class performance.\nPros\n- Lightweight, compact design with sport fins\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Good sound quality for the price\n- Decent noise canceling\nCons\n- Sweat-resistant (IPX2 rating) but should be at least IPX4\nCarrying a list price of about $100, Samsung's 2023 Galaxy Buds FE feature a single driver (Samsung isn't saying what size it is), three mics on each earbud and active noise canceling. They charge in a case that's the same size and shape as what you currently get with all of Samsung's latest Galaxy Buds, including the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. And they look a lot like an updated version of Samsung's discontinued Galaxy Buds Plus earbuds, which also came with a set of swappable fins that helped create a secure, comfortable fit. Like those buds, the Galaxy Buds FE are sweat-resistant with an IPX2 water-resistance rating that protects against splashes.\nThey don't sound quite as rich as the Galaxy Buds Pro, and their voice-calling performance isn't up to the Buds Pro's level (it's decent, not great). But they do offer respectable sound quality (it's certainly as good as the Galaxy Buds 2's) and decent noise canceling. I also found them to be lightweight and comfortable to wear. While they may not measure up to more premium earbuds, including the Buds Pro, they deliver good bang for the buck. The Galaxy Buds FE are rated for up to 6 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and 8.5 hours with it off.\nPros\n- Good sound quality for clip-on earbuds\n- Nicely-designed with comfortable, secure fit (flexible joint)\n- Good voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nThe Soundcore by AeroClip are Anker's current flagship clip-on earbuds. Not only do I like their design -- they have a premium look and feel -- but they're comfortable to wear and feature very good sound for clip-on buds. Equipped with 12mm drivers, they serve up ample bass with good volume and decent clarity. The buds sound fuller and more open than many cheaper clip-on buds and are among the better-sounding open earbuds I've tried (Android users should note that they have support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). I also thought they worked well for making calls. For the most part, callers said they could hear me clearly -- even in noisier environments like the streets of New York City (Anker says they have four beamforming mics, wind-blocking meshes and advanced AI). Battery life is rated at up to 8 hours at moderate volume levels, and the buds are IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant (they're splash-proof). Their only drawback is their somewhat high price tag.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound and noise canceling\n- Good battery life\n- Case has wireless charging\n- Voice-control features built into buds\nCons\n- Buds and case are a little big\n- Voice-calling performance could be slightly better\n- Voice-control features are a bit hit or miss\nIn recent years, with its new earbuds, Bose has focused on premium noise-canceling buds with premium price tags. But now it's released more affordable QuietComfort Earbuds at $179 (\u00a3180) for folks priced out of its $299 (\u00a3300) flagship QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. The new QC Earbuds, as Bose calls them, don't perform quite as well as the QC Ultra Earbuds, but they offer a very secure fit, strong sound and noice-canceling performance while adding a few new features, including built-in voice controls, not found in the Ultras.\nPros\n- Smaller design\n- Improved sound and noise-canceling\n- New, more powerful Tensor A1 chip\n- Excellent battery life\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Hands-free Google Assistant for Android users\n- Spatial audio\nCons\n- Ear tips may not allow some people to get a tight seal\n- No support for AptX or LDAC audio codecs for Android users\n- A few features not available for Apple users\nGoogle has redesigned its Pixel Buds Pro 2 to fit more ears better. Not only are the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smaller than their predecessor but Google's equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and enables its new \"hands-free, eyes-free\" Gemini virtual AI assistant. As long as you get a snug fit and tight seal (yes, that's critical for sound quality and noise-canceling performance), these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users.\nPros\n- Improved battery life (up to 10 hours)\n- Improved voice-calling performance\n- Good sound quality if you get a tight seal\n- Fully waterproof\nCons\n- Case is fairly large\n- Some people may not be able to get a tight seal\nJBL upgraded its ear-hook style sport earbuds in 2023. Available in black or white, the Endurance Peak 3 buds offer better battery life (up to 10 hours with four extra charges in their case), improved voice-calling performance and an IP68 rating that makes them fully water- and dust-proof. They also have an Ambient Aware transparency mode and Talk Thru mode that can automatically lower your music's volume level and open up the buds to the outside world. That means you can have conversation with someone without removing the buds from your ears.\nThey stayed on my ears securely during runs and I thought they sounded quite good, although they do have a bit of bass push (i.e., they have powerful bass). Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side. That said, the buds do seem durable and if you get a good fit, they're an excellent and less pricey alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro. I also thought the touch controls worked well; I was easily able to toggle through the sound modes.\nPros\n- Comfortable\n- Swappable sweat-proof ear pads included\n- Good sound\n- Decent noise canceling\n- Strong battery life\nCons\n- Fairly pricey\n- No companion app at launch\nKnown for its swim headphones and earbuds, H2O Audio has now branched out into more land-based headphones with its Ript Ultra over-ear headphones and Ript Light earbuds. For working out, the Ript Ultra headphones' key feature are their ear \"cushions.\" Two swappable sets are included: one is covered with soft-to-the-touch silicone and is sweatproof (the pads are washable) while the other is covered with soft faux leather for everyday use. Both sets of cushions are nicely padded with memory foam on the inside and the headphones are comfortable to wear, though slightly heavy at 10.5 ounces (298 grams).\nThe Ript Ultra are fairly pricey but they do sound good and feature decent noise canceling as well as long battery life (up to 50 hours at moderate volume levels). I'm not sure they sound quite as good as some $250 headphones -- they lack a bit of clarity -- but they're pretty dynamic and have some warmth to them with plenty of punchy bass. Voice-calling performance was also decent and the headphones come with a protective carrying case and include a cord for wired listening. Hopefully, they'll come down in price a bit because they have some appealing traits, especially those swappable ear cushions, and seem to be sturdily built even if they are mostly made of plastic.\nPros\n- Excellent sound and best-in-class noise canceling\n- Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system gets you a secure, comfortable fit\n- Immersive Audio creates a different listening experience\n- Slightly improved voice-calling\nCons\n- No wireless charging or multipoint Bluetooth\n- Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life\nWhile the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're definitely a little better. They should fit most ears well and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. And a natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and relatively comfortable for on-ear headphones\n- Excellent battery life\n- Good sound for their price\nCons\n- Entry-level look and feel\n- Limited feature set with no wired option\nSony released these entry-level CH-720N noise-canceling headphones in 2023. They're quite good but if you can't afford them (they list for $150), the company's new budget on-ear CH-520 headphones are an intriguing option for only about $50.\nThey lack noise canceling and are pretty no-frills but they feature good sound for their price, are lightweight and pretty comfortable for on-ear headphones. They also have excellent battery life (they're rated for up to 50 hours at moderate volume levels). Additionally, they have multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with two devices simultaneously, such as a smartphone and computer, and switch audio. Voice-calling performance is decent but not up to the level of what you get with the CH-720N.\nNote that there's no wired option -- this is a wireless Bluetooth-only headphone. The CH-520 offers overall balanced sound with decent clarity. The bass has some punch to it but doesn't pack a wallop, and you're not going to get quite as wide a soundstage as you get from Sony's more expensive over-ear headphones. But these definitely sound better than Sony's previous entry-level on-ear headphones and sound better than I thought they would. I tried the white color but they also come in blue and black.\nPros\n- Improved sound quality, ANC and ear pad design\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No Apple H2 chip\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No major design changes except for case\nLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones in 2008. This is the fourth generation and they carry the same list price as their predecessor. They look similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate because of a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read our full review to find out what makes these very good headphones, albeit with some caveats.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Good sound with very good noise canceling\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- 35 hours of battery life\nCons\n- No carrying case\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No LDAC audio codec support\nSony's improved entry-level noise-canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. But they sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these have already seen significant discounts, with prices dropping to as low as $98 during flash sales.\nFactors to consider when buying workout headphones and earbuds\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new workout earbuds or headphones. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good options for less than $75. But the premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150.\nNoise-isolating or open design\nWorkout earbuds are available in a couple of styles. Some come with silicone tips that are designed to create a tight seal in your ear and keep sound out (they have a noise-isolating design). Others have an open-ear design with the buds resting on top of your ears, firing sound into them. The noise-isolating style typically gives you better sound with stronger bass while the open-ear design has the advantage of allowing sound in for safety reasons.\nFit (comfort)\nIt's key that workout earbuds and headphones fit you not only comfortably but securely. The best headphones should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds (or headphones) for long periods of time without any irritation.\nDurability\nYou want workout buds or headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your workout buds and headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one.\nHow we test workout earbuds and headphones\nWe test the best headphones and earbuds for working out based on six key criteria and evaluate the models we test in both a gym environment and for outdoor workouts that include a three-mile run. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.\n- Design: Evaluating design, we assess not only how comfortable the headphones and earbuds fit (their ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. When it comes to earbuds, we also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.\n- Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\n- Noise-canceling performance: We evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out to the streets of New York to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they do muffling not only street noise but people's voices.\n- Extra features: Some great-sounding workout headphones and earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user friendly it is.\n- Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones or earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voice.\n- Value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones and earbuds against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. The best headphones balance price, quality, and functionality.\nOther workout headphones and earbuds we tested\nEdifier LolliClip: Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds may be the best-sounding and most comfortable clip-on earbuds but they list for $300. In contrast, Edifier's new LolliClip buds cost $130 and their sound is pretty close to what you get with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds -- and they're almost as comfortable to wear while fitting my ears securely. They also have some features the Bose buds don't have, including active noise canceling (it's not all that effective but you do sense it muffling some noise in the lower frequencies), a heart-rate monitor, blood oxygen sensor and spatial audio with head-tracking. There's also a low-latency mode for gaming and support the LDAC for Android users.\nJabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: Jabra billed these buds, which have unfortunately been discontinued, as the \"world's toughest earbuds,\" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true. While there are two new color options, the Gen 2 model doesn't look any different from the original but it includes an LE Audio smart case, allowing wireless streaming from any device with USB-C or 3.5mm port (I tested it with inflight entertainment and it worked well, with no audio lag). The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 also feature enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio \"for a better music experience,\" enhanced Natural HearThrough for better awareness when outdoors, and improved noise-canceling performance.\nSoundcore by Anker Sport X10: The Soundcore Sport X10 have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks that flip up when you're using them and flip down when you want to set them in their charging case, which has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. As long as you get a tight seal, they sound good, with powerful, punchy bass and good detail. They also have active noise canceling, which is effective but not as good as Sony's or Bose's noise canceling. They're also fully waterproof with an IP rating of IPX7, which means they can be fully submerged in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. Battery life is rated at up to eight hours with an additional three charges in the charging case.\nShokz Open Move: Shokz' entry-level OpenMove bone-conduction headphone lists for $80, although we've occasionally seen it drop below $70. It replaces the older Titanium model and features some small design upgrades. I found it comfortable to wear and while it doesn't sound great, it sounds relatively good for a bone-conduction headphone -- again, keep your sound quality expectations in check or you'll be disappointed. It's very good for listening to podcasts, audiobooks and news broadcasts while you run.\nSennheiser Sport True Wireless: The Sport True Wireless bluetooth earbuds (about $130) are essentially Sennheiser's CX True Wireless earbuds with sport fins -- for a more secure fit -- and better durability. They have an IP54 rating that makes them splash-proof and dust-resistant. The CX True Wireless, rated IPX4, don't offer dust resistance.\nSkullcandy Push Active : With their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro and they actually fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro -- I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but these are one of the better models. They also cost a lot less than the Beats.\nCleer Audio Arc 2 Sport: Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. The 2023 model (about $170) steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new \"enhanced\" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro: While the Powerbeats Pro remain popular workout earbuds, they've been around for several years so it's best to buy them at significant discount.\nJBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL headphones have put out some decent true-wireless bluetooth earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IP rating of IPX5 (splash-proof) and wireless charging.\nSony LinkBuds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 or the LinkBuds S noise-isolating Bluetooth earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as decent sound and very good voice-calling performance. Like the third-gen AirPods, their open design allows you to hear the outside world -- that's what the ring is all about. Read our Sony LinkBuds review."

      "text": "When I test headphones and earbuds for running, I focus on how comfortably and securely they fit, along with how durable they are, and other key factors like how easy it is to access and operate their controls. Sound quality and voice-calling performance are also important. While noise-isolating earbuds with active noise canceling come with transparency modes that allow you to hear the outside world, many runners and bikers prefer fully open earbuds or bone-conduction headphones to avoid having anything in their ears (for safety reasons). I've tested all the products on this list and fully reviewed several of them.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nWhat are the best headphones or earbuds overall for running?\nWhile I currently have the Shokz Open Fit 2 true-wireless earbuds at the top of this list, it's hard to declare one model the best overall for running because there are so many good ones. That said, I like a lot of the new sport-oriented open earbuds that have integrated ear hooks or a clip-on design because they fit the most securely -- you don't have to worry about them falling out of or slipping off your ears.\nWhat We Updated: April 2025\nWe added the Shokz OpenDots One and SoundCore by Anker AeroClip buds to the list.\nRead more: Best Wireless Earbuds of 2025\nBest running headphones and earbuds of 2025\nPros\n- Slightly improved design and comfort\n- Impressive sound for open earbuds\n- Improved battery life\n- New physical control button\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nShokz has released the second-gen OpenFit 2 with a slightly upgraded design, upgraded drivers that noticeably improve the sound quality, better battery life and a new physical control button. The changes don't seem huge on the surface, but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality with more bass and better clarity. They sound excellent for open earbuds -- at least in quieter environments.\nPros\n- Dual-driver technology improves sound dramatically\n- Comfortable and secure open-ear design\n- Low vibration\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Limited sound leakage\nCons\n- Somwhat pricey\nThe problem with bone-conduction headphones has always been that they just don't sound all that good. That is unless you plug up your ears, which defeats the safety benefit of their open-ear design and is why they're so popular with runners and bikers. Well, that just changed. Shokz has finally cracked the code on bone-conduction sound quality with a novel dual-driver design in its new flagship OpenRun Pro 2 headphones ($180).\nWith the OpenRun Pro 2, Shokz has solved the bass deficiency issue by adding a second, more traditional speaker driver that's tasked with firing bass frequencies toward your open ears. Shokz employed that same micro-speaker technology (it calls it \"air conduction\") in its first non-bone-conduction headphones, the OpenFit ($140) and Open Fit Air ($120) true-wireless earbuds.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound with more bass\n- Good battery life\n- Well-priced\nCons\n- A little heavier than Shokz models\nAnker's Soundcore AeroFit 2 open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds, which also listed for $100. The second-gen Aerofit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements. The buds aren't as light as the Shokz OpenFit 2 buds and don't sound quite as good, but they cost quite a bit less and offer good all-around performance with augmented bass response. Available in multiple colors, they're a good option for those looking for ear-hook style open earbuds with a fairly premium design and good sound quality without the high price tag of top-end models.\nPros\n- Improved design and sound quality with smaller case\n- Equipped with more powerful H2 chip\n- Good noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Heart-rate sensors\n- Strong battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Some users may not get a tight seal\n- A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2\n- More basic Find My feature (no Precision Finding)\nWhy I like them\nThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the 5 different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThese new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.\nReasons to buy\nFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).\nPros\n- Good sound quality for clip-on earbuds\n- Nicely-designed with comfortable, secure fit (flexible joint)\n- Good voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nThe Soundcore by AeroClip are Anker's current flagship clip-on earbuds. Not only do I like their design -- they have a premium look and feel -- but they're comfortable to wear and feature very good sound for clip-on buds. Equipped with 12mm drivers, they serve up ample bass with good volume and decent clarity. The buds sound fuller and more open than many cheaper clip-on buds and are among the better sounding open earbuds I've tried (Android users should note that they have support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). I also thought they worked well for making calls. For the most part, callers said they could hear me clearly -- even in noisier environments like the streets of New York City (Anker says they have 4 beamforming mics, wind-blocking meshes and advanced AI). Battery life is rated at up to 8 hours at moderate volume levels and the buds are IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant (they're splash-proof). Their only drawback is their somewhat high price tag.\nPros\n- Good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Good battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Voice-calling performance could be a little better\nThe well-designed OpenDots One are among the best open earbuds out there right now. While they don't sound quite as good as the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, they're pretty close and fit my ears slightly better and have better battery life. Like the Ultra Open Earbuds, which list for $299 but are currently on sale for $249, they're overpriced, but at least they cost less than the Bose and their case has wireless charging. Read review.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Active noise canceling\n- Spatial audio with head tracking\n- Heart-rate and blood oxygen detection\nCons\n- Noise canceling isn't all that effective\n- Touch controls are a little finicky\nBose's Ultra Open Earbuds may be the best-sounding and most comfortable clip-on earbuds. But they list for $300. In contrast, Edifier's new LolliClip buds cost $130 and their sound is pretty close to what you get with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds -- and they're almost as comfortable to wear while fitting my ears securely. They also have some features the Bose buds don't have, including active noise canceling (it's not all that effective but you do sense it muffling some noise in the lower frequencies), a heart-rate monitor, blood oxygen sensor and spatial audio with head-tracking. There's also a low-latency mode for gaming and support the LDAC audio codec for Android users.\nThe buds have a battery life rating of up to 6 hours with noise canceling on and 9 hours with it off at moderate volume levels. As for water-resistance, their IP56 rating means they can withstand a sustained spray of water and they're also dust-resistant. As I said, I was overall impressed with the sound quality. It's not going to be quite as good as what you get with noise-isolating earbuds with silicone ear tips that you jam in your ears, but for open buds it's quite good. With these type of buds, which allow you to hear the outside world for safety reasons, the bass tends to be a little weak. But the LolliClip buds output ample bass (you have a few EQ settings to choose from, including a bass boost mode) and offer decent clarity. Note that you will have to play around with the fit of the buds on your ears to optimize the sound quality -- a little adjustment can make a significant difference. Voice-calling performance was good but not exceptionally so.\nMy only gripe is with the touch controls. They're a little finicky (you have to figure out just what is the touch zone), but you do get several customization options in the Edifier ConneX companion app.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable, secure fit\n- Attractively designed\n- Good sound\n- Easy-to-use pinch controls\n- Decent battery life\nCons\n- Some competitors sound slightly better\nThe Nothing Ear (Open) buds may not sound quite as good as Shokz' OpenFit 2 buds, but they do offer very respectable sound for open earbuds and I found them lightweight and comfortable to wear (the overall fit and where the buds end up sitting on your ears will impact sound quality, particularly when it comes to bass performance). Overall, the buds are well-designed and feature Nothing's signature translucent plastic on the exterior of the bud. They're IP54 certified, which means they're splash-proof and dust-resistant.\nAside from their design, I liked their pinch controls and slim, elongated case. Voice-calling performance was also good, though it can be a little harder to hear callers in noisy environments because these are open earbuds. Battery life is rated at 8 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional 22 hours in the charging case. While there's a bass boost mode as part of the equalizer settings in Nothing's companion app for iOS and Android (there's also a \"low-lag gaming mode), the buds can deliver only so much bass. But I was happy wearing them nevertheless.\nPros\n- Upgraded design from X10\n- Secure, comfortable fit\n- Slightly better sound and noise canceling\n- Improved battery life\n- Fully waterproof and dust-proof\nCons\n- Lack a bit of clarity\n- Sound is degraded if you don't get a tight seal\nThe Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. They don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks.\nFully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 has slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get five sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. The buds are affordable and a good value overall.\nAs for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent but not exceptionally good.\nPros\n- Lightweight\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound and noise canceling\n- Strong voice-calling performance\n- Built-in voice controls\nCons\n- Case is slightly big\n- No wireless charging\nTruth be told, in some ways, I like the Sony's new LinkBuds Fit better than its flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-canceling earbuds. While they don't sound quite as good or have noise canceling that's quite on par with those buds, they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is due to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, but it's also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step-down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls. Read our hands-on first take.\nPros\n- Lightweight and very comfortable\n- Excellent design\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Good call quality\nCons\n- Sound quality and battery life is slightly better with step-up OpenFit model\nShokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. However, this model, like Shokz's step-up OpenFit true-wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology.\nWhile Shokz' flagship OpenFit 2 buds sound slightly better, have better battery life (up to 11 hours instead of 6 at moderate volume levels) and a physical control button, the Open Fit Air cost around $60 less and are a tad lighter and quite comfortable to wear. Available in three colors, they're lightweight (8.5 grams) and comfortable, and I liked how the ear hooks felt soft but had just the right amount of rigidity. They're IP54 splash-proof and dust-resistant and their charging case is fairly compact for this style of sports buds with ear hooks.\nWhile the earbuds sound quite good for open earbuds, they don't sound quite as good as a set of noise-isolating earbuds in this price range (they're a tad bass shy). Nor do they sound as good Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which do cost more and serve up a little more bass and fuller sound; the Bose also sound slightly better than Shokz' Open Fit buds. Equipped with two microphones in each bud, the Open Fit Air offer good voice-calling performance. Additionally, the feature multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them to two devices simultaneously.\nPros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nPros\n- Smaller ring-shaped driver and new Air Fitting Supporters create a more comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound\n- Decent voice-calling performance\n- Built-in voice controls\nCons\n- May not fit some ears comfortably\n- Fairly pricey\nWhile the LinkBuds Open retain the ring-shaped open driver of the original LinkBuds, it's slightly smaller than the original's driver (11 versus 12mm). Also, the Air Fitting Supporters are an improvement over the original's Arc Supporters, which were quite slim and didn't conform to the shape of your ear as well as these new supporters do. The combination of the slightly smaller driver design and the new supporters should allow the buds to fit more ears more comfortably and securely. However, those with smaller ears may have some issues with them.\nI personally got a very secure fit and was able to run with the buds without a problem (they're IPX4 splashproof). The originals created some pressure points for some wearers. I had to fiddle around with their positioning in my ears from time to time, but I didn't experience any pain points with the LinkBuds Fit. However, Apple's new AirPods 4 were slightly more comfortable in my ears, though they didn't fit as securely.\nAside from the fit, the other big change is to the sound quality. It's definitely improved. Despite the smaller drivers, the buds play more loudly and also deliver a little more bass. The buds are equipped with Sony's V2 digital processing chip and Sony says the driver's have a \"high-compliance diaphragm and powerful neodymium magnet\" that were \"specifically selected to reproduce clear mid and high frequency sound.\" I also liked the built-in voice controls.\nPros\n- Lightweight design with integrated wingtip that fits securely\n- Good sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H1 chip\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- No enhanced My Find with proximity view (only standard Find My)\nThe Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, but they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds and 2023 Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise cancellation, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Secure fit with open design\n- Relatively good sound for bone-conduction headphones\n- USB-C charging\nCons\n- Bass lacks fullness (not for critical listening)\n- Neckband design isn't for everybody\nShokz's OpenMove bone-conduction headphones list for $80. The OpenMove headphones have some small design upgrades over their predecessors. I found them comfortable to wear, and while the sound isn't great, it's relatively good for a bone-conduction headphone. Again, keep your sound quality expectations in check or you'll be disappointed. They're very good for listening to podcasts, audiobooks and news broadcasts while you run. I tend to listen to Sirius XM radio while running.\nThis model charges via USB-C and includes a simple carrying pouch. Battery life is rated at up to 6 hours.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit\n- Good sound\n- Loaded with features\n- Touchscreen in charging case\n- Built-in voice controls\n- Dolby spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nCleer's Arc 2 earbuds were among the best-sounding open wireless earbuds with an ear-hook design. Among this style of open buds, the new Arc 3 buds are still near the top for sound but other companies like Shokz and Bose have caught up and arguably sound slightly better. But the Cleer Arc 3 buds have something that other buds of this ilk don't have: a touchscreen LCD built into its charging case. It allows you to control playback and access the buds' features, including EQ settings and even use the case as a remote to snap a photo on your smartphone.\nIn fact, the Arc 3 are probably the most feature-rich open earbuds out there right now -- and they're fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. They have built-in voice controls to raise and lower volume, and skip tracks forward and back, as well as Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head-tracking. Additionally, you can nod your head twice to take a call or shake your head back and forth to reject it (this feature is referred to as gesture controls). And finally, they have a UV light that sterilizes the buds when they're in the case. Oh, and a step counter.\nWhile the sound can be a tad uneven from track to track, and the buds' bass lacks a little punch compared to what you get with a good set of noise-isolating buds in this price range, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. They also offered solid voice-calling performance. They're a little expensive but their price seems to be creeping down a bit.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Don't look or feel cheap\n- Decent sound\n- Relatively compact charging case\nCons\n- Companion app is underwhelming\nI didn't try the original Soundpeats GoFree earbuds, but the second-gen GoFree 2s deliver a good value, with decent sound for open earbuds that sit on top of your ears -- there's a touch of distortion at higher volumes, but they have ample bass. While they don't quite look or feel like premium buds, they also don't look or feel cheap. They're missing premium features like ear-detection sensors (when you take one off, your music doesn't automatically pause), and their companion app for iOS and Android is a bit underwhelming. But I found them pretty comfortable to wear, they fit securely and their touch controls worked well.\nThey're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, have support for the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android phones that support it, and they are IPX5 splash-proof. Battery life is rated up to nine hours at moderate volume levels and their case is one of the more compact cases I've seen for these types of earbuds.\nI thought voice-calling performance was acceptable, though not great. These are open earbuds, so they do let sound in, and it can be a little hard to hear callers in noisier environments.\nPros\n- Great battery life\n- Ambient Aware mode is handy\nCons\n- Case is bulkier than most\nJBL upgraded its ear-hook style sport earbuds in 2023. Available in black or white, the Endurance Peak 3 buds offer better battery life (up to 10 hours with four extra charges in their case) improved voice-calling performance and an IP68 rating that makes them fully water- and dust-proof. They also have an Ambient Aware transparency mode and Talk Thru mode that can automatically lower your music's volume level and open up the buds to the outside world. That means you can have a conversation with someone without removing the buds from your ears.\nThey stayed on my ears very securely during runs and I thought they sounded quite good, although they do have a bit of bass push (i.e. they have powerful bass). Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side. The buds do seem durable and if you get a good fit, they're an excellent and less pricey alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro. I also thought the touch controls worked well; I was easily able to toggle through the sound modes.\nPros\n- Significantly improved sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's new H2 chip\n- Better battery life and upgraded microphones\nCons\n- Basically the same design as the previous model\n- No high-resolution audio\nAs long as you can get a good, secure fit, the lightweight second-gen AirPods Pro make excellent earbuds for running and feature a top-notch transparency mode that allows you to hear the outside world. They now come with extra small ear tips for those with very small ears, but Apple still doesn't have extra-large tips for those with larger ears.\nFactors to consider when buying running headphones\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new wireless sports buds. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable sports buds for less than $75. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150.\nNoise-isolating or open design\nSports buds are available in a few styles. Some come with silicone tips that are designed to create a tight seal in your ear and keep sound out (they have a noise-isolating design). Others have an open design with the buds resting on top of your ears, firing sound into them. The noise-isolating style typically gives you better sound with stronger bass while the open design has the advantage of allowing sound in for safety reasons.\nEar hooks or not\nSome sports buds feature designs with integrated ear hooks or sports fins. Both help keep the buds more securely on or in your ears. They aren't essential to getting a secure fit (there are buds with no ear hooks or fins that fit some people securely), but they do help. Not everybody finds these types of designs comfortable.\nFit and comfort\nIt's key that sports earbuds fit your ears not only comfortably but securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds for long periods without any irritation.\nDurability\nYou want sports buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your sports at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one.\nHow we test running earbuds and headphones\nWe test running headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria and evaluate the models we test in both a gym environment and for outdoor three-mile runs. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.\n- Design: Evaluating design, we assess not only how comfortable the headphones and earbuds fit (their ergonomics) but also their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. When it comes to earbuds, we also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.\n- Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\n- Noise-canceling performance: We evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out to the streets of New York to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they muffle not only street noise but people's voices.\n- Extra features: Some great-sounding running headphones and earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user-friendly it is.\n- Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones or earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voices.\n- Value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones and earbuds against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther running headphones and earbuds we tested\n1More Fit SE S30: 1More makes a few open sports earbuds with ear hooks, including the newer Fit SE S31 ($50). The Fit S50 ($100) feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). But I like the fit a little better on the step-down S30, which is IPX5 splashproof (it can sustain a spray of water) and costs less than $40, making it a better value.\nSoundcore by Anker AeroFit Pro: The AeroFit Pros are among the better open-ear \"air conduction\" earbuds, with a premium look and feel, and are comfortable to wear. (I had no problem keeping them on my ears while running or working out.) On the downside, they're expensive, but they do feature strong audio quality for these types of earbuds, with ample bass and volume, plus decent clarity. They're good for making calls (they do a pretty good job of reducing background noise) and also offer strong battery life of up to 14 hours at moderate volume levels.\nJabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: Jabra billed these earbuds, which have unfortunately been discontinued, as the \"world's toughest earbuds,\" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true. While there are two new color options, the Gen 2 model doesn't look any different from the original, but it includes an LE Audio smart case which allows wireless streaming from any device with USB-C or 3.5mm port. I tested them with in-flight entertainment and they worked well, with no audio lag. The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 also feature enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio \"for a better music experience,\" enhanced Natural HearThrough for better awareness when outdoors and improved noise-canceling performance.\nSony Link Buds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods. They don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-isolating earbuds, but they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as good sound and very good voice-calling performance.\nEarfun Free Pro 2: We used to have the EarFun Free Pro 2 earbuds on this list. They're still available at a discount and are decent earbuds for running but EarFun has released the new EarFun Free Pro 3 buds, which are a definite upgrade.\nJBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 has stems while the Live Free 2 has a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging.\nShure Aonic 215 II: Shure's Aonic 215 II is kind of the audiophile equivalent of the Beats Powerbeats Pro. They have a hook that wraps around the top of your ear, and they stay in my ears very securely (even more securely than the Powerbeats Pro earbuds). Like that Beats model, they have a jumbo charging case. What's interesting about them is that the Bluetooth module is detachable. (I liked the physical control button they have instead of touch controls.) As the name implies, the Aonic 215 True Wireless Noise-Isolating Earphones incorporate Shure's SE215 buds, the $99 model in its line of earbuds that have detachable cables. The modules, which can be bought separately for $229, are designed to drive any Shure earbuds that have a detachable cable, including the $899 SE846.\nSennheiser Sport True Wireless: The Sport True Wireless earbuds are essentially Sennheiser's CX True Wireless earbuds with sport fins (for a more secure fit) and better durability. They have an IP54 rating that makes them splash-proof and dust-resistant. These aren't noise-cancelling earbuds but they do have an awareness mode that allows ambient sound to leak into the buds so you can hear what's going on around you for safety reasons. They use Bluetooth 5.2 and have support for the AAC and AptX audio codecs. Battery life is rated at up to 9 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional two charges in the charging case (there's no wireless charging).\nSony Float Run: Sony's Float Run is a unique take on \"off-ear\" headphones, which is another way to describe open earbuds that sit away from your ears. I can't say these have the greatest sound -- the bass is underwhelming -- but they fit my head securely and comfortably. They're designed for folks who don't like to have earbuds jammed into their ears, and runners who want to hear the outside world for safety reasons.\nSkullcandy Push Active : With their ear-hook design, the Skullcandy Push Active are essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro, and they fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro. I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but this model is one of the better ones."

      "text": "Finding the perfect streaming device isn\u2019t just about connecting to your favorite shows, movies and sports; it\u2019s also about how the experience fits into your lifestyle. Whether you need lightning-fast navigation, cinematic sound with Dolby Atmos compatibility or crystal-clear 4K HDR visuals, there\u2019s a device for you \u2013 especially handy if your older smart TV isn\u2019t keeping up with the latest streaming platforms. We\u2019ve spent hours testing every major streaming device and smart TV system on the market. From Roku and Google to Amazon Firesticks and Apple TV, we\u2019ve dug deep to bring you honest, detailed insights. Stick with us as we guide you through the best streaming devices available today.\nOur Picks\nSTREAMING PLAYER DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $30 (save $20)\n- $35 (save $6)\n- $84 (save $16)\n- $100 (save $40)\nWhat is the best streaming device overall?\nWe prefer Roku's content-agnostic approach, ease of use, large app library and excellent search functionality over those from other companies. We've found that the Roku Express 4K Plus is usually the cheapest Roku that offers 4K HDR streaming, and is therefore the best streaming device to buy. The Express 4K Plus lacks Dolby Vision support, but we've found that this usually isn't a deal-breaker, as Dolby Vision only works on some TVs (and notably not Samsung). Additionally, we don't think that Dolby Vision looks any better than regular HDR and isn't generally worth extra money.\nThat said, there are times during the year when the Roku Express 4K Plus is not our top pick. This occurs when the Streaming Stick 4K is on sale and is cheaper than the Express 4K Plus. The Streaming Stick 4K offers all the same functionality of the Express 4K Plus, but includes Dolby Vision support -- which is why it's typically more expensive. We don't think this addition is worth the premium price, but it certainly shouldn't prevent you from grabbing the Streaming Stick 4K if it's the cheaper of the two.\nBest streaming devices of 2025\nPros\n- Super simple, app-based menus\n- Cheaper than 4K HDR rivals\n- Fast and responsive\n- Ethernet support (with third-party adapter)\n- Dolby Atmos supported on some apps\nCons\n- No Dolby Vision support\n- Roku's voice assistant remains weaker than rivals from Amazon, Apple and Google\nRoku is our favorite streaming system, with the most streaming app options, the simplest streaming platform interface and the best search. It also has a content-agnostic platform that doesn't push any one media streaming service provider, like Amazon Prime Video or Apple, over another. The Express 4K Plus streaming media player is one of the cheapest streaming TV options with 4K HDR. (Even if your current TV doesn't support those formats, your next one probably will.) Thanks to the AirPlay update, this Roku device is one of the least expensive ways to connect your iPhone or other Apple device to your TV. It is cheaper than the company's Streaming Stick 4K Plus and other 4K HDR streaming devices, and it's our top pick for best streaming device overall.\nPros\n- Robust app and Dolby Vision support\n- Simple interface\n- Good search for TV and movies\nCons\n- Costs $10 more than the nearly identical Express 4K Plus\n- No support for gaming services\n- No smart home control\n- Voice assistant remains limited\n- Does not support Dolby Atmos\nThe Roku Streaming Stick 4K features the same simple interface, large app selection and impressive search function found on all Roku devices, but also offers Dolby Vision support. Along with a stick-like design, Dolby Vision HDR is the main difference between the Streaming Stick 4K and the Express 4K Plus, and is ostensibly why the Streaming Stick 4K is more expensive than its sibling. While we think the Streaming Stick 4K is a great device, we're just not sold on the Dolby Vision upgrade -- mostly because we generally don't think that it provides a major image quality upgrade over standard HDR. But if Dolby Vision is important to you, this device will not disappoint.\nPros\n- Useful remote\n- Large app selection\n- Makes excellent use of the Google Assistant\n- Ties in well with YouTube TV, Google Photos\nCons\n- Can lag when switching apps or using voice\n- Assistant doesn't always give the best option to play back content\n- No full Dolby Atmos\nThe Chromecast with Google TV 4K isn't quite as good as the Roku Express 4K Plus, but it comes closer than any other device on the market. Chromecast outdoes Roku by adding Dolby Vision compatibility, but its biggest smart device strength is Google Assistant voice search, which works well for finding stuff to watch. We also like the impressive integration with other Google services such as Google Photos and YouTube TV. The interface is more evolved-looking than Roku, but ultimately we prefer Roku's simpler approach, no-nonsense search results and lower price. That said, the new Chromecast is a better smart streaming device choice for those already living in Google's world.\nPros\n- Fast loading times\n- Latest playback standards offered\n- Amazon ecosystem capabilities\nCons\n- Only slightly improved from previous model\nLike its predecessor, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2023) loads apps almost immediately, and navigating around the system is swift and smooth. Even better, the Max offers Wi-Fi 6E and nearly all the latest playback standards, including Dolby Vision. For people hooked into the Amazon ecosystem, the new Ambience mode can include up-to-date delivery information on your TV screen. Though it's only a little better specified than the original Max, the second gen is now officially the best Fire Stick on the market today.\nPros\n- Cheaper starting price than previous Apple TV 4K\n- Speedy performance\n- Modern, A15 Bionic chip\n- Robust app and format support, integration with other Apple services\nCons\n- Still a lot more expensive than rival, capable streamers\n- No noticeable apps or experiences to take advantage of new chip\n- TV gaming on Apple Arcade remains lacking\n- Ethernet is just on the priciest model\nThe 2022 Apple TV 4K starts at $129, $50 less than its previous version. It also has a faster A15 Bionic processor under the hood and an updated Siri Remote that swaps out the proprietary Lightning connector for USB-C. If those changes sound minor, that's because they are. When using the device, it's hard to see any real difference compared to last year's model.\nBut it continues to be a good choice for those who want an Apple device to use Apple Arcade for gaming or take full advantage of their Apple One subscription bundles. Video purists will appreciate its flexible HDR and TV calibration feature.\nFor most people, however, Apple's venerable remote control streaming device just isn't worth the money, especially now that Roku has nearly all the major apps and AirPlay. If you really want Dolby Vision, you can find that on the Roku Streaming Stick 4K at a fraction of the price.\nPros\n- Compact, easy to set up and affordable\n- Excellent dialogue reproduction\n- Tried and true Roku experience\nCons\n- Lacks bass in movies and music\nSoundbars with streaming onboard may be a relatively recent development, but Roku's new Streambar nails it. It has the Roku interface we know and love, complete with 4K HDR with improved sound for any TV, especially dialog. It's smaller and more affordable than its predecessor, the Roku Smart Soundbar, but we think the new Streambar media streamer device makes more sense for most people.\nPros\n- Cutting-edge streaming with 4K AI upscaling, Dolby Vision\n- Native Android, cloud gaming and Steam Link options\n- Improved Android TV interface with Google Assistant\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Some issues understanding voice commands\n- Slower than Roku to launch Netflix\nSure, it's an expensive media device -- and that's before adding a game controller -- with 8GB of storage and 2GB RAM, compared to 16GB of storage and 3GB RAM, but if you want a jack-of-all-trades video streaming player, the Shield is it. In addition to 4K streaming and HDR, it offers a robust library of games, both console-level and Android TV, Steam Link, built-in Google Assistant complete with smart home control, NAS access, Plex server capability, HD HomeRun integration and much more.\nFactors to consider when choosing a streaming device\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to consider how much you're willing to spend on a new streaming device. Higher-end devices can cost well over $100, like the Apple TV 4K, the Roku Streambar, and the NVIDIA Shield TV. But if your budget is a little tighter, there are plenty of simpler yet still very effective streamers which are priced as low as $30.\nBrand compatibility\nYou'll want to consider the other brands in your home's ecosystem before choosing a product. If you're already an Apple loyalist, you might opt for the Apple TV to round out your supply of iPhones and HomePods. Or, if you're already an Amazon Prime subscriber, the Fire Stick may be your best option. Google and Chrome junkies may prefer to keep it in the family with several Chromecast and Google options to complete their ecosystem. In any case, keeping it \"in the family\" may be your best bet in terms of picking your streaming device.\nUse cases\nConsider what exactly you'll be using your streaming device for. Are you looking for extra streaming services beyond what your TV already offers? Are you looking for a powerful device which you are also able to game on? Make sure your use cases align with the capabilities of the streaming device you choose.\nDisplay hardware and connectivity\nAsk yourself how you'll be integrating the streaming device into whatever environment you're buying for. Most devices offer both HDMI connectivity and Wi-Fi, though wireless connectivity issues may force some people to use Ethernet, for example. Consider whether you're willing to add wires to your setup to let your streaming device run as smoothly as possible.\nHow we test streaming devices\nEvery streaming device we review receives hours of hands-on testing. Typically, this involves installing the device on multiple TVs, evaluating the setup process, adding popular streaming channels and using the product as if it were our own. We use all of the major features available on the platform and note how they stack up against the competition. To do this, we hook rival streaming devices to the same TV so we can switch back and forth easily to compare the experiences.\nOur metrics that we look at to rate a device include: hardware design and features, remote capabilities and design, overall platform ease-of-use, effective layouts and design, search capabilities, privacy settings, the number of apps and their performance, and the overall speed and reliability of the system.\nOther streaming devices we've tested\nRoku Ultra LT: This is technically the cheapest current device with Roku's streaming system and an Ethernet port. The savings compared to the actual, non-LT Ultra isn't much, however, and it lacks that device's slick extras like Dolby Vision, programmable keys, fast app launching and the remote finder.\nJubileeTV: JubileeTV's modus operandi is to simplify streaming TV access for aging Americans. With technology constantly advancing and an overwhelming amount of content available, older viewers can feel lost. JubileeTV provides a familiar viewing experience for seniors to enjoy their favorite programming while staying connected to family and loved ones. Learn more about the simplified streamer in our full JubileeTV review.\nRoku Ultra (2024): The Roku Ultra (2024) has seen some upgrades including a new caching system for faster loading times and a new voice remote with USB-C charging. If you already have an Ultra, then simply buy the new Voice Remote Pro 2nd Edition instead. Read CNET's full review of the Roku Ultra (2024).\nFire TV Stick 4K: The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K debuted in 2018 and is still around today. While we generally think it's worth it to upgrade to the Max, the original Fire TV Stick 4K is still a good choice for those who want 4K streaming without paying for the latest bells and whistles, namely Wi-Fi 6 and blazing-fast speed.\nFire TV Stick Lite: The Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is our favorite budget streaming device, besting the Roku Express. The Lite trounces the Express in features-for-the-money. This Fire TV's biggest advantage is a remote with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. The cheapest Roku with a voice remote is the Express Plus 4K, which uses Roku's more basic voice system, not Alexa. The Fire Stick's remote also doesn't need line of sight to work. If you want to spend as little as possible on a streaming player, learn more about the Fire TV Stick Lite in our full review."

      "text": "Pros\n- Lightweight design with integrated wingtip that fits securely and comfortably in your ear\n- Very good sound\n- Effective noise canceling and excellent transparency mode\n- Better battery life than AirPods Pro\n- Powered by Apple's H1 chip, so they have most of the features AirPods Pro, including spatial audio\n- Beats app for Android users\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- Currently no enhanced My Find with proximity view (only standard Find My)\nEditor's note, Dec. 8: This review has been updated to note that the Beats Fit Pro earbuds have been awarded a CNET Editors' Choice Award. The review is otherwise largely unchanged from the version originally published Nov. 1, 2021.\nReleased just a few days after the debut of the third-gen AirPods, Apple has another new set of earbuds, this time from its subsidiary audio company, Beats. Technically, the new Beats Fit Pro ($200) aren't AirPods, but they're built on the same tech platform as Apple's 2019 true-wireless model. Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. And for some people, they might just be better than the AirPods Pro -- which is why we'veAirPods you've always wanted awarded them the CNET Editors' Choice Award in 2021.\nThe Beats Fit Pro are officially debuting today, but if they look familiar, it's because they've leaked twice in the past few weeks -- first during an iOS update and more recently, when Kim Kardashian was spotted wearing them.\nThe concept behind the Fit Pro is pretty simple. Take Beats iconic Powerbeats Pro sports buds with its big ear hook and shrink it down. I can't say I ever loved the Powerbeats Pro's design but a lot of people do because the ear hook gives you a feeling of security that your buds aren't going to fall off your head. I personally prefer my sports buds to have a wingtip that fits into the inside of your ear rather than wrap around the outside of it. And that's what we have here.\nMost of the time those wingtips -- or sports fins as they're sometimes called -- are removable and often come in different sizes. But what's interesting with the Fit Pro is that it's a one-size-fits-all wingtip that's been integrated into the design. You can't replace it as far as I can tell but it does seem durable and it's made of firm but pliable silicone rubber that's soft to the touch. The buds fit comfortably and securely in my ears and never felt like they would slip out, even when I ran with them (I never lost the good seal I had with the ear tips). I much prefer this design to that of the Powerbeats Pro.\nBeats earbuds have always had a physical control button -- which I like -- and the Fit Pros also have one. What's nice about it is that because it's an extension of the wingtip, it has a soft-to-the-touch finish and a little bit of grip to it.\nYou use it to control music playback and answer and end calls -- and a long press switches between noise-canceling and transparency modes. You can also program the long press to be volume controls on the buds themselves, a feature a lot of people have been asking for on the AirPods -- and maybe one we'll see migrating to those models now that Beats has debuted it to the Appleverse. These also have always-on Hey Siri so you can raise and lower volume just by asking Apple's voice assistant. You can also issue other voice commands without touching a button.\nThe buds are lightweight, weighing 5.6 grams each and are IPX4 water-resistant, which means they're splash-proof (same as the AirPods Pro and AirPods 3). They fit my ears really well and come in four color options -- white, lavender, gray and black. I'm a little surprised Beats didn't do red for launch, but I'm sure you'll see more colors next year.\nRead more: Best true-wireless earbuds\nBefore I get into features and performance, I just have a few more comments about the design. The one big complaint about the Powerbeats Pro is their huge case. The case for the Fit Pro isn't quite as small as the one for the AirPods Pro or even the Beats Studio Buds, but it's still compact and much smaller than Powerbeats Pro's case. In a bit of a nod to Android users, the case charges via USB-C not Lightning. However, it's missing the wireless or MagSafe charging found in AirPods Pro and AirPods 3 cases. That's not a big deal in my opinion, but you might disagree.\nBattery life is rated at up to 6 hours with noise canceling on and 7 hours with it off at moderate volume levels. That's compared to around 4.5 hours for the AirPods Pro with noise canceling on and 5 with it off (the AirPods 3 also are rated for up to 6 hours but they don't have active noise canceling). You can get an extra 21 hours of juice or around 3.5 charge cycles when the case is fully charged.\nVirtually the same features as the AirPods Pro\nAside from the lack of wireless charging and MagSafe compatibility, the only other notable feature currently missing from the the Beats Fit Pro compared to the AirPods Pro is enhanced Find My with proximity view that allows you to precisely locate your AirPods within a few feet of where they might be hiding. The Beats Fit Pro currently have standard Find My, but Beats has confirmed that it's working to add enhanced Find My and the additional AirPods updates that were part of iOS 15.1 in a future firmware update. But that won't include wireless charging, which would require a hardware upgrade.\nOne of the big downsides of the Beats Studio Buds is that they don't have Apple's H1 chip, so they're missing things like Apple's Adaptive EQ feature that detects how the earbuds are sitting in your ears and optimizes sound on the fly along, as well as spatial audio and auto switching between devices on your iCloud account. But as noted, these new Beats Fit Pro have the H1 chip on board, so you're getting an AirPods Pro-like experience with better sound and noise canceling than the Studio Buds, as well as a top-notch transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world in a natural way. As far as I can tell the noise canceling and transparency are at the same level as the AirPods Pro or very close to it. The noise canceling isn't quite as good as that of the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but it's effective at muffling external noise. It's not adjustable, however -- the modes are noise canceling on, noise canceling off and transparency mode. And there are no EQ settings to customize the sound profile.\nTo my ears, these actually appear to sound slightly better than the AirPods Pro (which, admittedly, are two years old). Beats says they have custom 9.5mm drivers and I think they have a touch more clarity and the bass packs a little more punch and goes a little deeper. Subtle differences in fit can change sound quality -- more on that in a minute -- but I got a tight seal with both sets of buds and I came away thinking the Beats Fit had a slight advantage. Using the Qobuz streaming service, which sounds better than Spotify, I run tracks such as Imagine Dragon's Monday, Spoon's Knock Knock Knock and The Hardest Cut, Foo Fighter's Everlong, Holly Humberstone's The Walls Are Way to Thin and Silk Sonic's Leave The Door Open through the buds and make comparisons. The Beats are a little bit more dynamic. They deliver plenty of bass but it's not overemphasized.\nThe Fit Pro have wide soundstage but they don't offer quite as expansive or refined sound as the more expensive Sony WF-1000XM4 buds. While I'm not talking about a big difference in sound quality, the Sony just sounds slightly more natural and has a touch more detail that can better bring out the nuances in music tracks. But I think the Beats' sound will impress a lot of you. It's good. And these avoid distorting at higher volumes, which probably has as much to do with the Adaptive EQ digital processing as the drivers.\nTight seal is crucial\nOf course, just how good a noise-isolating earbud sounds is dependent on how good a fit you get. And I'll just point out that I got a decent seal with the largest size of the included tips (like with the AirPods Pro, these have an ear tip test that tells you if you have good seal). But I ended up switching them out for my go-to Sennheiser tips that tend to fit my ears best with a lot of buds, including the Sonys.\nThis is a little wonky, but a of companies include tips with a slightly recessed tube -- that's the part that attaches to the earbuds post (see photo below). But the Sennheiser's tube is flush with the outer rim of the tip so once you put it on the post, the tip extends out from the bud a few millimeters more. Those few millimeters and the shape of the Sennheiser tips created a perfect seal in my ears.\nTo be clear, the Beats tips fit my ears well -- and they should most people's ears well -- but I'm looking for the perfect fit when I test buds so I get the optimal performance for sound quality as well as noise-canceling, which can suffer if you don't get a tight seal. I can't tell how important ear tips are -- they can make or break an earbud -- and I just wanted to mention how a subtle design difference can make an impact. And unlike with the AirPods Pro, which have a custom tip design, you can basically swap any tips in. (Note that I tend to use third-party foam tips with the AirPods Pro to get a better seal. Foam tips offer a little more grip and I have no problems running with the AirPods Pro.)\nApple-only extras meet Android appeal\nLike the AirPods Pro, these Beats have ear-detection sensors with skin detection so they can tell when the buds are actually in your ears and not in a pocket, for example. They automatically pause your music when you take your earbuds out and resume playback when you put them back in (there is way to turn this feature off).\nI'm not going to talk much about Apple's new spatial audio feature with head tracking other than to say it's a nice bonus feature that allows you to get virtual surround sound when you're watching movies and TV shows on various Apple devices. Like I said in my AirPods 3 review, it's a neat effect with video watching but a bit more hit or miss with Apple music tracks with Dolby Atmos. It also now works with group FaceTime calls, which is kind of cool.\nThe Beats Fit Pro will pair with most other Bluetooth audio devices, but you lose all the extra features like spatial audio and always-on Hey Siri and audio sharing with other people who have AirPods. However, unlike the AirPods, Beats has an app for Android devices that makes their buds slightly more friendly to Android users. At least it's making some effort to appeal to the other side of aisle.\nFrom an Android perspective, the good thing about the Beats Studio Buds not having an H1 chip was that except for always-on Hey Siri, it didn't have those extra Apple-only features, so you didn't feel like you were missing out on anything. In this case you are, but Android users still might consider these anyway, thanks to their design, strong sound, good noise canceling and transparency modes and mostly good voice-calling performance.\nSlight step behind AirPods for calls -- for now\nYes, they are better than the Studio Buds and Powerbeats Pro for making calls but arguably not quite as good as the AirPods or AirPods Pro -- at least for the moment. According to Beats, they have 6 microphones, up to 5 of which are used during calls, a voice accelerometer helps isolate your voice and there's a wind-mitigation system.\nIn my torture tests in the streets of New York, they did a decent job reducing background noise but there were some subtle differences between these and the AirPods Pro and AirPods 3. Some people said they heard slightly more background noise with the Beats and didn't think my voice came across quite as clearly (perhaps that's due to the AirPods' stems being a little closer to your mouth). With the noise canceling on, I could hear everyone quite well, so no complaints on my end.\nIt's quite possible we get some improvements with firmware upgrades, but for now I'd have to say these are good for voice calling but a slight step behind both the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro -- at least in noisy environments.\nBeats Fit Pro: Final thoughts\nThat said, for me, the Beats Fit Pro came out as the winner over the AirPods Pro. They're the sporty AirPods I've always wanted. I like the AirPods Pro a lot and have no problem keeping them in my ears. I can also see how some people like the familiar pipe design of the AirPods with their now shorter stems. And not everybody likes having the Beats \"b\" splashed across their earbuds. But the Fit Pro really do lock in your ears and if you get a tight seal they sound slightly better and have equally good noise canceling. Their battery life is also a little better and you're not stuck with the single \"AirPods white\" color.\nFor people who are a little worried about the size and fit of the Sony WF-1000XM4 and some the other top sounding buds, including those from Sennheiser, Master & Dynamic, Bowers & Wilkins and Bang & Olufsen (check out our full list of best-sounding wireless earbuds), the Fit Pro are a viable alternative that's a little more affordable and may be a more comfortable fit for your ears (I don't have a problem with the Sony's fit but some people do).\nIt will be interesting to see how much these hurt sales of the Beats Studio Buds and AirPods Pro. They're hard to compare to the AirPods 3 because if you're getting those, you're getting them for their open design. But I do think you'll see the $150 Studio Buds on sale more frequently. They've already been on sale for $20 to $30 off and I wouldn't be shocked if they head closer to the $100 mark.\nWhile the AirPods Pro list for $250, they now generally sell for around $200 and sometimes less online. So they're basically the same price as the Beats Fit Pro. I guess Apple wins either way if you buy one or the other, but it's funny to see two models from the same company competing directly with each other. Maybe it will bring out the best in Apple and the AirPods Pro 2 will be that much better when they arrive, perhaps as soon as next year. But for now these may very well the best Apple earbuds you can buy, particularly if you're looking for buds that lock in your ears."
