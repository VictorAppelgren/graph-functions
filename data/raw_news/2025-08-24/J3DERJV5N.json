  "title": "India, Australia trade talks hit dairy, wine tariff hurdles as year-end deadline looms, say sources",
  "description": "NEW DELHI/CANBERRA (Reuters) -India has rejected Australia's push for deeper tariff cuts on dairy and alcohol, hampering efforts to conclude the second phase of a trade pact by year-end, two Indian government sources said.  An interim trade pact signed in 2022 lowered tariffs on a range of goods, but negotiations on a broader Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) covering goods, services and visas have slowed, with dairy and wine emerging as key sticking points, the sources said.  The officials declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media on confidential trade talks.",
