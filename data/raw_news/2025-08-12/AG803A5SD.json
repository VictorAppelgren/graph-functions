  "title": "What If An All-Time Great New York Mets Core Isn\u2019t A Championship Core?",
  "description": "The 12 months bridging Steve Cohen\u2019s fourth and fifth seasons seemed to establish the Mets built an alternative to the championship-or-bust standard of measuring success.",
  "content": "The Mets spent the first four seasons of Steve Cohen\u2019s tenure making him look either way too optimistic or not optimistic enough for declaring on Nov. 10, 2020 \u2014 his first full day as the team\u2019s owner \u2014 that he \u201c\u2026would consider that slightly disappointing\u201d if \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t win a World Series I the next three-to-five years.\u201d\n\nBut the 12 months bridging Cohen\u2019s fourth and fifth seasons seemed to establish the Mets had built an acceptable alternative to the championship-or-bust standard of measuring the success of his first half-decade at the helm.\n\nWinning a title this year would be great for the Mets, of course. But for 53 or so weeks from last June to this June, the Mets looked like something they\u2019d never been in the previous six decades: A consistently good, mostly drama-free team that was redefining the Mets experience. The embarrassing episodes were gone, along with the excuses for coming up just short in pursuit of the best free agents. Home games were a communally happy experience instead of one in which 40,000 people were conditioned to expect the most cynical outcome possible.\n\nBut the last six weeks have been an awfully familiar throwback to the old days. The Mets enter tonight\u2019s game against the Braves (oh dear) in the midst of a seven-game losing streak \u2014 their second seven-game skid since June 13, when they blew a five-run lead against the Rays to begin an 18-31 swoon. Only the Rockies and Nationals have a worse record in that span.\n\nThe Mets, who led the NL East by 5 1/2 games following the games of June 12, are six games back of the Phillies entering today and just two games ahead of the Reds in the race for the final wild card spot.\n\nThe collapse has been total for the Mets, who should take the field tonight to Lloyd Christmas bellowing about pets\u2019 heads falling off. The Mets have scored the fewest runs (194) and allowed the third-most runs (259) since June 13.\n\nThe quintet of Pete Alonso, Francisco Lindor, Jeff McNeil, Brandon Nimmo and Juan Soto are batting a combined .230 with 39 homers and 126 RBIs over the past 49 games. The only starting pitcher to last six innings since June 7 is David Peterson. The only pitchers other than Peterson to even throw a pitch in the sixth inning since then are Clay Holmes, who has done it twice, and Griffin Canning, who did it once but is out for the season after suffering a torn Achilles on June 26.\n\nThe rotation problems aren\u2019t unique to the Mets. David Stearns pivoted from the durable and unspectacular Jose Quintana and Luis Severino to Canning, Holmes and Frankie Montas, but his moves wouldn\u2019t look any better if he\u2019d decided to ask Cohen to open up the checkbook for some combination of Corbin Burnes, Roki Sasaki and Blake Snell.\n\nThe real concern for the Mets in the short- and long-term is their position player core \u2014 a core that, sans Soto, has been intact for the entire rollercoaster ride of the Cohen era.\n\nThe Mets have rarely had a quartet as accomplished as Nimmo, Lindor, McNeil and Alonso \u2014 who rank 14th, 16th, 17th and 18th in franchise history per Baseball-Reference WAR \u2014 on the field at the same time over the last six-plus decades.\n\nAlonso, McNeil and Nimmo are triumphs of scouting and development. Alonso is one homer away from breaking a tie with Darryl Strawberry atop the all-time franchise list. The stories of McNeil, who battled injuries throughout his minor league career before winning the 2022 major league batting title, and Nimmo, a raw Wyoming product who played 564 games in the bushes before reaching the bigs for good in 2017, are particularly rewarding for an organization that previously struggled to graduate everyday players to the big leagues.\n\nLindor\u2019s emergence from his mistake-filled first season into a captain candidate might be an even bigger long-term win for the franchise because he serves as a reminder the Cohens will be far more patient and supportive owners than the Wilpons ever were. The $765 million helped, for sure, but Soto didn\u2019t have to worry about getting thrown under the bus the first time he struggled or committed a public relations error.\n\nBut is the Alonso-Lindor-McNeil-Nimmo the core that can lead the Mets into an era of sustained championship contention?\n\nThey have been the constants over the last four-plus seasons, a stretch in which the Mets have gone 405-361 \u2014 the 12th-best record in the majors \u2014 while matching euphoric highs with excruciating lows. A 2021 season in which the Mets led the NL East into August but finished 77-85 was followed by a 101-win 2022 in which the Mets were knocked out of the wild card round by the Padres. The Mets went 75-87 and began retooling in 2023 before coming back from 11 games under .500 last season to reach the NLCS.\n\nThe last 14 months have been especially extreme for the Mets, who led baseball with a 110-62 record from June 3, 2024 through this June 12. But that stretch of .640 baseball has been bookended by spans in which the Mets went 42-66 (.389), a 99-loss pace over a 162-game season. Was Jose Iglesias really that big an addition and subtraction? And if so, what does that say about the core?\n\nThis stumble hasn\u2019t been as sudden as the 2007 and 2008 downturns, but the expanded playoff field would make missing the playoffs the greatest collapse in team history and erase any progress the Mets have made in reshaping their reputation as entertaining foils for their biggest and more successful rivals.\n\nEven the most token of efforts by Derek Jeter to make an \u201cappearance\u201d at Yankees Old-Timers Day Saturday included a dig at the Mets. The Braves are in the midst of their worst season in almost a decade, but generations of Atlanta stars \u2014 some with Mets ties! \u2014 will nonetheless cackle with delight if the Braves continue their mastery of the Mets over the next two weeks. The Phillies making the World Series while the Mets don\u2019t even qualify for the tournament might inspire a third Chase Utley-themed episode of \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nMaybe, in an age of reboots and updates, this is the modern telling of the 1999 team, which suffered eight-game and seven-game losing streaks but made it to game six of the NLCS. Perhaps this drama really is embedded in the Mets\u2019 DNA and another deep playoff run is on the horizon. The Mets might not be any different than anyone else during an era in which there are no great teams. And all this fretting about the core will look really silly if the Mets take the long-awaited third parade down the Canyon of Heroes this year or next.\n\nAnd if none of this happens? Then the Mets will be much closer to coming to grips with the possibility that one of the great cores in team history may not be the one that gets the franchise to the next level.",

      "text": "Only a handful of people have spent as much time this century with both the Braves and Mets than Jeff Francoeur, who opened his career with 730 games for his hometown team before playing 199 games in the Big Apple.\nSo if he can\u2019t figure out the Braves\u2019 multi-generational dominance of the Mets, what hope is there for the rest of us?\n\u201cIt\u2019s still so weird, man,\u201d Francoeur said early Tuesday night, before the Braves continued doing their part to try and ruin another Mets season with a come-from-behind 7-3 win. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom the fact.\u201d\nTo be fair to the Mets, whatever magic they had over the previous two-plus months disappeared before they arrived in Atlanta last Tuesday. The Mets\u2019 1-10 skid started with a sweep two weekends ago at the hands of the Rays, who won the three games at Citi Field in an increasingly convincing manner.\nBut five straight losses, many in familiarly painful fashion, to the Braves have underlined the rapidity of the Mets\u2019 fall while serving as a reminder of the multi-layered history that may be in the process of repeating itself.\nThe Braves are 37-41 this season and have a winning record against just four of the other 16 teams they\u2019ve opposed. Yet they are two wins away from clinching the season series against the Mets for the eighth straight season and the 24th time in 32 seasons since Atlanta joined the NL East in 1994.\nThe Braves are 28-10 against the Mets since the start of the 2022 season \u2014 a span in which the Mets have won six more playoff games than Atlanta.\n\u201cThe fact that they can\u2019t beat them consistently \u2014 it\u2019s so weird,\u201d said Francoeur, who broadcast Tuesday\u2019s game for TBS. \u201cRight now, I think the Mets are the better team. But something changes when they play.\u201d\nThe Braves have undoubtedly derived a little more pleasure out of beating the Mets than anyone else this century \u2014 some of which stems for how the Mets operated in the before times.\nTravis d\u2019Arnaud, the only position player to appear in 200 games for both the Mets and Braves since 2000, said in 2024 that no team makes him angrier than the Mets, who cut him in 2019 after he appeared in just 10 games following his recovery from Tommy John surgery. For good measure, d\u2019Arnaud is hitting .307 against the Mets since leaving the team.\nLater in 2019, infielder Adeiny Hechavarria was released by the Mets one day before he would have earned a $1 million roster bonus. He signed with the Braves, whom he helped to an NL East crown while declaring how thankful he was to no longer be with the Mets.\nAnd some of it is the joy hyper-competitive athletes take from vanquishing the same little brother rival over and over and over again. None of the four Braves icons \u2014 Francoeur along with Hall of Famers Tom Glavine, Chipper Jones and John Smoltz \u2014 in the home broadcast booth could contain their glee June 8, 2023, when Ozzie Albies\u2019 walk-off homer capped a third straight comeback win and basically ended the Mets\u2019 season.\nAfterward, Albies declared sweeping the Mets was \u201c(t)he best feeling.\u201d\n\u201cI remember when I got drafted in \u201902 and then got called up in \u201905 \u2014 when we came up to New York, it was like \u2018We\u2019re gonna kick their butts,\u2019\u201d Francoeur said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing. Chipper ingrained it. Freddie (Freeman) ingrained it. And so it kind of gets passed down.\u201d\nIt even trickles down to the non-uniformed staffers. Told Monday the good vibe surrounding the Mets at Citi Field this season might change if the Braves sweep the series, one member of the traveling party said \u201cFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears.\u201d\nTwo more wins by the Braves this week might do a lot more than just change some vibes. Over the last 13 days, the Mets \u2014 forever linked with the 2007 and 2008 collapses that cost them playoff berths \u2014 have gone from owning baseball\u2019s best record and a 5 1/2-game lead over the Phillies in the NL East to clinging to a two-game lead over the Brewers and Cardinals in the race for the last NL wild card berth.\nThe five wins over the Mets also provides a dangerous spark for the Braves, who are six games behind the Brewers and Cardinals but no strangers to impressive in-season comebacks.\nThe 2001 Braves were eight games out of first in June before winning the 10th of their record 14 straight division titles. The 2021 team didn\u2019t get over .500 until August and won the World Series. A year later, the Mets led the Braves by 10 1/2 games in June and seven games in August before Atlanta finished on a 35-15 kick to win the division (thanks to a tiebreaker gleaned from sweeping the Mets in Atlanta on the final weekend).\nOf course, these are the Mets, for whom incredible comebacks are as much a part of the collective experience as agonizing collapses. And there are plenty of memorable moments the Mets have enjoyed at the expense of the Braves.\nBut the Grand Slam Single, the 10-run eighth-inning comeback on June 30, 2000, Mike Piazza\u2019s famous home run hit in the first game in New York after 9/11 and last year\u2019s playoff clincher in Atlanta all have one thing in common: They were outliers that didn\u2019t categorically change the Braves dominance.\nThe 1999 NLCS ended with Andruw Jones literally walking it off after the Mets squandered a pair of late-inning leads following a comeback from a six-run first-inning deficit. The 2000 Mets made the World Series without having to play the Braves in October. Two days after Piazza\u2019s homer, Armando Benitez blew a save to cost the Mets a sweep and a chance to move within 3 1/2 games of first place. And last season ended two wins shy of the World Series for the Mets.\nLast season also offered up so many reminders that the Mets are liable to render all this hand-wringing and historical perspective moot by late October or early November. But right now, they are watching history repeat itself in real time\u2026over and over and over again.\n\u201cThey have outplayed us,\u201d Francisco Lindor said Tuesday night. \u201cThey have played better defense, ran the bases better. They hit better. Overall they have done everything better than us.\u201d\nFor whatever reason, they usually do."
