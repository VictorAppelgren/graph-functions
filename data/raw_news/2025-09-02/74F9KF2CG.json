  "description": "The world has changed many times over since I first walked into a newsroom 40 years ago. In most ways, it's a much better place now than then.",
  "content": "That sounds almost like a political statement these days, but it shouldn't be. No matter what politicians, activists and others with an agenda tell you, the reasons for optimism far outweigh the case for fear and discouragement.\n\nThis week, I will wrap up a nearly 42-year career in journalism. The world has changed many times over since I walked into a newsroom in Owensboro, Kentucky, for the first time as a fulltime professional.\n\nAnd on most measurements, our world is a much better place now than then.\n\nYou know, I can hear you. \"Yeah, right,\" you muttered. \"This guy can't exit stage right fast enough.\"\n\nBut no, really. The facts are on the side of optimism.\n\nMany trend lines are upward and to the right\n\nTake, for example, the standard of living in much of the world. The World Bank estimates that the global extreme poverty rate was 43% in 1985. It's now less than 9%.\n\nThat's extraordinary progress over the past 40 years \u2212 largely thanks to capitalism and global trade.\n\nHumans are not only wealthier, but we also are living longer than ever before. Life expectancy around the world was 62.2 years in 1985. By 2023, it had increased to 73.2 years. Even in the United States, where we are routinely told that Americans are dangerously unhealthy, life expectancy has increased from 74.56 years in 1985 to 79.25 last year.\n\nStatistics aside, I can attest, as someone born in the swinging '60s, that Americans' standard of living is much higher now than then. Homes are bigger and more comfortable. Cars are safer and more reliable. Health care is immensely better (although much more expensive). Violent crime rates are down significantly, since at least the early 1990s. The civil rights of all Americans are better respected and better protected than 60 years ago (one example: Fort Lauderdale's world-famous beaches were still racially segregated in my lifetime).\n\nI can still hear you muttering. What about climate change? Income inequality? Donald Trump and MAGA? The loony left and socialism? Artificial intelligence and the \"end of work\"?\n\nI'm not saying that we don't have problems, or that you shouldn't be concerned about any or all of those things. What I am saying is that the prophets of doom have been consistently wrong for at least the past 60 years. I'm confident they are still wrong, and they will be wrong 60 years from now when my grandchildren are my age.\n\nIn 1984, when I began my career, we were told to fear imminent nuclear annihilation, mass starvation triggered by overpopulation, the depletion of oil and gas leading to economic collapse, the extinction of whales and many other species, and President Ronald Reagan's \"police state.\"\n\nNone of it happened.\n\nOnly a few years ago, we were told that the American dream is dead and that the millennial generation would forever trail baby boomers and even Gen X in health, wealth and happiness.\n\nMillennials on track to become wealthiest generation\n\nGuess what? Millennials are now financially better off than baby boomers were at the same age, and they're on track to become the wealthiest generation in human history. You know who is likely to surpass them? Their children.\n\nRapid advances in medicine are not only extending lives but also dramatically improving the quality of life for older people like me and almost certainly will do so to an unimaginable degree over the next 20 or 30 years as millennials near retirement age.\n\nSo, healthier and wealthier? Check. Happier? Not so much.\n\nYounger Americans, in particular, are more discontent now than in past decades. Rates of anxiety and depression spiked before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. surgeon general even declared that loneliness and isolation were at epidemic levels in 2023.\n\nThe reasons for the disconnect between the upward and to the right trend lines in so many areas of our lives and the downward spiral of our emotional, mental and spiritual health are complex and varied, although the wasteland of social media is often identified as a primary cause.\n\nMy lifelong profession also has a role. Journalism is structurally designed to miss the most important story of our lifetimes \u2212 that life on this planet is better now than it has ever been for a rapidly growing number of people.\n\nAs an old editor I worked for said, we don't write about planes landing safely at the airport because it's not news. Yet, we go Defcon 1 when a plane crashes, and rightly so. But focusing almost solely on problems while largely ignoring what works can lead to skewed perceptions.\n\nSticking with air travel, flying has become roughly twice as safe each decade for almost 60 years. In 1968, one commercial air passenger died for every 350,000 passengers who boarded a plane. In 2022, it was 1 per every 13.7 million.\n\nBut only 64% of Americans this year said air travel is \"somewhat\" or \"very\" safe. That disconnect is driven, at least somewhat, by 24/7 news coverage of plane crashes.\n\nMuch of life is about assessing risk \u2212 is it safe to cross the street, to eat the brown banana, to invest in that new computer company called Apple? (I sadly missed that last one. Apple stock traded at 10 cents a share my first year as a journalist.)\n\nMost things are not getting worse \u2013 really\n\nWhen we're fed information on news platforms and social media feeds that paints the world as unceasingly dark and scary, it affects how we think about our own surroundings and how we act. I have friends who won't visit our city's downtown because they've read and heard so much about crime in our community, even though the downtown is largely safe for most people and crime stats are trending in the right direction.\n\nIn 2023, University of Virginia researchers studied the public's negative perceptions about long-term trend lines. The authors concluded, \u201cWe found something on which all Americans seem to agree: Things are getting worse than they really are.\u201d\n\nIn reality, most things are not getting worse. They are getting better, and in many cases, much better \u2212 whether or not we acknowledge that fact.\n\nYou are certainly free to choose pessimism, fear and despair if that's what you want. I choose optimism. And the facts are on my side.\n\nThat's enough for now. You've been a great audience all these many years. Thank you for joining me on the journey. It's been good, and I've enjoyed it immensely. But my ride is here.\n\nTim Swarens will retire this week after a nearly 42-year career as a journalist, including working as an editor and writer at USA TODAY, the Indianapolis Star and the Miami Herald.

      "text": "90 seconds to midnight: From Doomsday Clock to 'The Last of Us,' our demise is always near\nA lot of money, fame and power can be had in the present by peddling dark visions of what lies in the future. And a lot of false prophets are willing to profit from our fear.\nMy first nuclear nightmare shook me awake one night when I was in elementary school in the 1970s. Five decades later, I still recall an image from that dream \u2013 I'm running in terror with other children on the school playground after we've been told of our imminent doom.\nMy last atomic dream was scorched into my memory as an adult \u2013 I am driving away from my college campus when a mushroom cloud erupts in the eastern sky.\nMy generation was programmed to fear the nuclear apocalypse, but we were neither the first nor the last to be conditioned to believe that the end is near. From The Doomsday Clock to \"The Last of Us,\" it seems we're always 90 seconds from midnight.\nOpinions in your inbox: Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns throughout the week\nIt's not that we lack from real danger \u2013 war, famine, disease, drought and atmospheric rivers continue to plague us, and likely always will. Yet I've learned to be leery of those who gaze into a cloudy future and speak with certainty about distant days.\nProphets of doom profit from our fears\nA lot of money, fame and power can be had in the present by peddling dark visions of what lies in the future. And a lot of false prophets are willing to profit from our fear.\nIn high school, I read \"The Population Bomb,\" a bestseller that predicted hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s because of overpopulation. The book's author, Stanford University entomologist Paul Ehrlich, became a minor celebrity, even sitting next to Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show\" set shortly before the first Earth Day in 1970.\nIt turned out to be fictitious nonfiction, of course. Global population has grown from 3.7 billion in 1970 (at the height of the book's influence) to 8 billion today.\nU.N. secretary-general: World population reaching 8 billion. What this means for the family of humanity.\nEarth Day: Could we save the planet if we treated it like a child?\nAt the same time, life expectancy across the planet has increased from 56 years in 1970 to more than 73 years today. And the United Nations projects that humans will live on average to be almost 82 years old by this century's end.\nAs a young adult in the '80s, I heard peers say it would be irresponsible to bring children into a world on the brink of nuclear annihilation and mass starvation. I hear such concerns echoed now by new generations who've been taught to fear the future.\nI used to mull when to have children: Now I ask if I should I have them.\nEvery generation has faced enormous challenges\nBut what if \u2013 and this will be hard for some even to contemplate \u2013 we're living not in the end of days but the best of days? If you doubt that is the case, point to the period of history when life was safer, more prosperous and held more opportunities for more of humanity. (Hint: It didn't exist.)\nYes, all things may fall apart and the center not hold. Perhaps, eventually, such things are inevitable.\nAdvice for Gen Z: Want to improve your mental health? Helping others can be a good way to help yourself.\nDon't they deserve a future?: I know firsthand how international aid fails refugees. Here's how we can fix it.\nBut I suspect that the children of today \u2013 like my own generation \u2013 will in time look back and say: We made it. And the journey was not nearly as bad as we feared.\nNone of this is meant to dismiss the dangers the world faces. War, in Ukraine or another part of the world, may spiral out of control. Another pandemic may be even worse than the current one. We may fail to adapt to climate change aggressively enough to forestall devastating consequences.\nBut living in fear isn't the way forward. And giving credence to the merchants of apocalypse comes at a prohibitive cost.\nDays after my mother was diagnosed with the cancer that would soon claim her life, I was alone with my father. \"It's gone so fast,\" he said. I realized he was talking about his life with my mother. He was 89 at the time. They had been married for 68 years.\nThese days, I recall that conversation when I think about the future. Life is short \u2013 even when it's relatively long. We don't need to fear what may come. We have more than enough of the good, bad and in between to embrace today.\nTim Swarens is deputy opinion editor for USA TODAY."

      "text": "The World Bank has continuously tracked global poverty at least since 1990 (for example, see World Bank 1990; Chen and Ravallion, Chen 2010; Ferreira et al. 2016, World Bank 2022). This also coincides with the beginning of our contemporary period of widely available household survey data which are needed to measure poverty. There is, however, a void for many countries before the 1990s. Household survey data is far more scarce in the 1980s and almost non-existent before then. Historical global poverty estimates have been offered by Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) and an OECD 2021 report. We outline a different method to extend the data series of annual global poverty to the end of the Second World War. Our main motivation for estimating historical poverty rates is to contextualize the size of the COVID-19 poverty shock in a broader historical perspective (see World Bank 2022 for a recent discussion).\nData and assumptions\nThe World Bank\u2019s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) hosts country-level household survey data starting around the 1980s. With each decade, there has been an increase in the number of countries with an available household survey. Fewer than 16 countries reported household survey data in a typical year in the 1980s compared to 37 countries in the 1990s and more than 75 countries in the following two decades (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Average number of countries with survey microdata each year by decade\nOne criterion selected by the World Bank for reporting global poverty is that the available survey data covers at least 50% of the population of low and lower-middle-income countries (within a three-year window), as well as the global population overall. This criterion is met for the years starting in 1981 and now up to 2019. However, there are reasons to scrutinize the data further in the 1980s. While the 50% minimum population threshold for the lower-income countries is met in the 1980s, this is driven mostly by available data in China, which has survey data for the years 1981, 1983, and 1987. For instance, 40% of the global extreme poor in 1987 lived in China, a low-income country in that period. At the same time, survey coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa was below the 50% threshold in the 1980s, so no regional aggregate is reported in PIP.\nAdditional uncertainty is introduced as there is a switch in the welfare aggregate used for China\u2014income was used to measure welfare until 1987, while subsequent datapoints (in 1990 and beyond) use consumption instead. Conceptually, consumption is less than or equal to income on average\u2014income can be used for consumption or savings; and so switching from one measure to the other will create a break in the series. Given the size of China in the global poverty counts during this era, this switch not only is a break in comparability in the Chinese poverty trends but also a break in comparability for the global poverty estimate. Between 1988 and 1989, global poverty (at the $2.15 line in 2017 PPP dollars) increased by 170 million people with China contributing 154 million. While we do not have survey microdata for China in those years, national accounts-based data suggests that between 1988 and 1989 household incomes grew not fell. Therefore, this increase in poverty is largely an artifact of the shift in the choice of the welfare aggregate in China from income in the 1987 survey (with poverty estimated at 67.5%) to consumption in the 1990 survey (poverty estimated at 72%). To obtain annual estimates of global poverty, these datapoints are interpolated (as described in Prydz et al. 2019)\nGiven the combination of relatively limited survey data in most countries in the 1980s, the break in comparability for China pre- and post-1990, and China\u2019s influence on the changes in global poverty in this period, we \u201cbackcast\u201d global poverty prior to 1990 rather than using the available microdata before 1990 for this exercise.\nBackcasting global poverty\nStarting with distributions of income or consumption for each country from PIP, all lined-up to 1990, we extrapolate each distribution backward using growth rates from PIP (largely based on WDI) supplemented by growth rates using Bolt and van Zanden (2020). We are able to do this for 164 World Bank economies. In the years when no growth data is available for these countries (mostly because the country did not exist in its present form), we assign the average growth of the region using the regional definitions in PIP. For the remaining countries with no microdata in PIP, we assign an average welfare distribution of the region. This gives us a distribution for each of the 218 World Bank economies for the period 1950 to 1989 similar to what we have in the period after 1990. We refer to the poverty estimates derived using this method as backcast estimates.\nNote that the extrapolations are based on the estimates of growth rates of per capita GDP for each country. These growth rates have no information about the dispersion in the welfare changes within each country. Hence, our backcast data assumes distribution neutrality within a country for the entire period from 1950 to 1989. While changes in inequality certainly affect poverty, historically, most changes to poverty have been driven by growth rather than distributional changes. Additionally, there is evidence that within-country inequality stayed relatively stable in this period which gives additional confidence to our estimate.\nSeventy years of progress and setbacks in global poverty reduction\nWe find that there was a gradual decline in global extreme poverty\u2014that is, those living below the $2.15 poverty threshold in 2017 PPP\u2014in the period from 1950 to 1990. Global poverty declined by about twenty percentage points over those 40 years. Figure 2 splices together three series: the backcast series from 1950 to 1990, the PIP data from 1990 to 2019 (labeled as historical data) and projected estimates for 2020 from the work by Mahler \u24e1 Yonzan \u24e1 Lakner (2022) (also see World Bank 2022).\nFigure 2: Global extreme poverty, 1950-2020\nFigure 3 shows the same series, but focuses on the annual changes. We find that global extreme poverty increased at only three points in time during the backcast period\u2014in the mid-1960s, in the early 1970s, and the late 1970s. The first episode is mostly explained by rising poverty in India, which experienced a tumultuous economic period in the mid-1960s (a drought, the war with Pakistan, devaluation). The latter periods roughly coincide with the first and second oil crises. For every other year, we observe (at least modest) declines in global poverty.\nOn average, poverty declined by 0.5 percentage points annually from 1950 to 1990. This rate of poverty reduction then doubled to 1 percentage point annually in the period after 1990 leading up to 2019. For the entire period after World War II up to 2019, global extreme poverty increased only in four episodes\u2014the first three discussed above, and the last during the mid-1990s triggered by the Asian financial crisis. Using these estimates, the shock due to COVID-19 is the largest negative shock to global poverty since WWII.\nFigure 3: Annual change in global poverty\nThe OECD\u2019s publication \u201cHow was life?\u201d also provides long-run estimates of extreme poverty. The largest estimated change in the OECD data series is a 1 percentage point increase in poverty rate from 50 to 51 percent in 1954. It is not clear what event drives this increase, but if it is real, it is a slightly larger percentage point increase than the 0.9 percentage point increase recorded in 2020 in our data. However, it was a much smaller increase in the number of poor people (in both absolute and relative terms) than recorded in 2020. We also looked at significant global events or events in large countries such as China and India that have occurred since the Second World War, such as the 1947 partition of British India, that may have increased poverty. None of these events was global enough in reach to result in the size of poverty increase seen in 2020. Perhaps the most significant global event considered, The Great Leap Forward in China (1958-1962), was a severe and large income shock, but it did not result in a large increase in global extreme poverty. This is because at that moment in time extreme poverty in China is estimated to have already been higher than 90 percent and thus had little scope to increase further.\nFinal words of caution\nA lot of uncertainty surrounds the estimates of global poverty. A large part of this uncertainty stems from the unavailability of household survey data (see here and here). As discussed above, our backcasting method ignores the changes in inequality between households within a country. In addition, there are uncertainties in countries\u2019 GDP estimates themselves. Studies (see here and here) have highlighted the concerns in the reported GDP from recent years, and there are additional uncertainties around GDP estimates for the years before 1990. Therefore, the backcast estimates of global poverty reported in this blog should be viewed taking into consideration these gaps in knowledge. However, despite these caveats, the available evidence indicates that 2020 was a solemn and historic year for many reasons, including the unprecedented rise in global poverty.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the UK Government through the Data and Evidence for Tackling Extreme Poverty (DEEP) Research Program.\nJoin the Conversation"

      "text": "Homicides, arrests, car thefts: How crime in Indy has fallen, and risen, so far in 2024\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Halfway into the year, Indianapolis hit a grim milestone.\nThe city marked its 100th homicide after a man died in an early-morning shooting June 27 on South Meridian Street.\nIn some aspects, crime has risen in Indianapolis as 2024 reaches the midway point. Other areas have markedly decreased since peaking in 2021.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown from data as of June 24, the latest available numbers:\nHow many homicides have there been?\nWhen it comes to the gravest of crimes, Indianapolis has seen 78 people killed so far this year.\nIt's a 17% decline from the same time in 2023. At this point last year, 94 people had died in criminal homicides.\nHomicides deemed criminal do not include killings investigators determined were self-defense or accidental. When factoring in those killings, the number reaches 101.\nThe city ended 2023 with 174 criminal homicides.\nRelated: Indianapolis killings in July 2024\nHow many shootings have there been?\nThe number of people who have been shot and survived in the city totals 268, which is a 12.4% decrease from last year. At this point in 2023, 306 people had been injured in shootings.\nFor both years, the average number of people shot per day in Indianapolis is more than one.\nHow else is crime declining?\nCrime has declined in several other categories.\nOverall violent crime is down 28%. In a further breakdown, aggravated assaults have reduced by 34%, recording 1,811 this year compared with 2,742 last year.\nRobberies are down 19.1%.\nWhere is crime rising in Indianapolis?\nOne category has seen a sharp increase in data provided by Indianapolis Metropolitan Police.\nAuto thefts continue to rise in the city, almost exclusively due to robberies of Kias and Hyundais. The stat follows a national trend, which started in 2021 as videos circulated on social media showing how people can peel the steering column off the cars and use a USB cable to start them.\nLast year, Indianapolis joined other U.S. cities in a lawsuit against the automakers, saying they have not done enough to prevent the thefts from occurring. The suit remains pending in federal court.\nHow many homicides have had an arrest?\nThe percentage of homicide arrests made by Indianapolis police is rising, reaching a 72% solving rate.\nAmong the 78 criminal homicides recorded this year, 31 have led to an arrest. Adding to this year's clearance rate, police have made numerous arrests from killings that occurred in years prior.\nThis is a sharp increase from prior years when roughly half of the city\u2019s homicide cases would go unsolved by the end of the year.\nMore coverage: 65% of Indianapolis killings unsolved in 2022. 'It's like a waiting list' for justice.\nHow did Indianapolis police increase their arrests?\nKendale Adams, Indianapolis\u2019 deputy chief of investigations, credits the rising rate to several factors.\nFirst, the agency has focused on beefing up its homicide unit, and assigning more detectives so their caseload more closely matches the widely adhered policy for detectives to juggle four or six homicides per year.\nAdams also attributed the rise to increased cooperation from the community and new policing technology. The department invested millions of dollars of federal funding into license plate readers and public safety cameras posted throughout the city. Police officials credited the technology for an arrest in the killing of a Dutch soldier downtown in 2022.\nContact IndyStar reporter Sarah Nelson at sarah.nelson@indystar.com"

      "text": "A growing share of Americans say reducing crime should be a top priority for the president and Congress to address this year. Around six-in-ten U.S. adults (58%) hold that view today, up from 47% at the beginning of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency in 2021.\nWe conducted this analysis to learn more about U.S. crime patterns and how those patterns have changed over time.\nThe analysis relies on statistics published by the FBI, which we accessed through the Crime Data Explorer, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), which we accessed through the National Crime Victimization Survey data analysis tool.\nTo measure public attitudes about crime in the U.S., we relied on survey data from Pew Research Center and Gallup.\nAdditional details about each data source, including survey methodologies, are available by following the links in the text of this analysis.\nWith the issue likely to come up in this year\u2019s presidential election, here\u2019s what we know about crime in the United States, based on the latest available data from the federal government and other sources.\nHow much crime is there in the U.S.?\nIt\u2019s difficult to say for certain. The two primary sources of government crime statistics \u2013 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) \u2013 paint an incomplete picture.\nThe FBI publishes annual data on crimes that have been reported to law enforcement, but not crimes that haven\u2019t been reported. Historically, the FBI has also only published statistics about a handful of specific violent and property crimes, but not many other types of crime, such as drug crime. And while the FBI\u2019s data is based on information from thousands of federal, state, county, city and other police departments, not all law enforcement agencies participate every year. In 2022, the most recent full year with available statistics, the FBI received data from 83% of participating agencies.\nBJS, for its part, tracks crime by fielding a large annual survey of Americans ages 12 and older and asking them whether they were the victim of certain types of crime in the past six months. One advantage of this approach is that it captures both reported and unreported crimes. But the BJS survey has limitations of its own. Like the FBI, it focuses mainly on a handful of violent and property crimes. And since the BJS data is based on after-the-fact interviews with crime victims, it cannot provide information about one especially high-profile type of offense: murder.\nAll those caveats aside, looking at the FBI and BJS statistics side-by-side does give researchers a good picture of U.S. violent and property crime rates and how they have changed over time. In addition, the FBI is transitioning to a new data collection system \u2013 known as the National Incident-Based Reporting System \u2013 that eventually will provide national information on a much larger set of crimes, as well as details such as the time and place they occur and the types of weapons involved, if applicable.\nWhich kinds of crime are most and least common?\nProperty crime in the U.S. is much more common than violent crime. In 2022, the FBI reported a total of 1,954.4 property crimes per 100,000 people, compared with 380.7 violent crimes per 100,000 people.\nBy far the most common form of property crime in 2022 was larceny/theft, followed by motor vehicle theft and burglary. Among violent crimes, aggravated assault was the most common offense, followed by robbery, rape, and murder/nonnegligent manslaughter.\nBJS tracks a slightly different set of offenses from the FBI, but it finds the same overall patterns, with theft the most common form of property crime in 2022 and assault the most common form of violent crime.\nHow have crime rates in the U.S. changed over time?\nBoth the FBI and BJS data show dramatic declines in U.S. violent and property crime rates since the early 1990s, when crime spiked across much of the nation.\nUsing the FBI data, the violent crime rate fell 49% between 1993 and 2022, with large decreases in the rates of robbery (-74%), aggravated assault (-39%) and murder/nonnegligent manslaughter (-34%). It\u2019s not possible to calculate the change in the rape rate during this period because the FBI revised its definition of the offense in 2013.\nThe FBI data also shows a 59% reduction in the U.S. property crime rate between 1993 and 2022, with big declines in the rates of burglary (-75%), larceny/theft (-54%) and motor vehicle theft (-53%).\nUsing the BJS statistics, the declines in the violent and property crime rates are even steeper than those captured in the FBI data. Per BJS, the U.S. violent and property crime rates each fell 71% between 1993 and 2022.\nWhile crime rates have fallen sharply over the long term, the decline hasn\u2019t always been steady. There have been notable increases in certain kinds of crime in some years, including recently.\nIn 2020, for example, the U.S. murder rate saw its largest single-year increase on record \u2013 and by 2022, it remained considerably higher than before the coronavirus pandemic. Preliminary data for 2023, however, suggests that the murder rate fell substantially last year.\nHow do Americans perceive crime in their country?\nAmericans tend to believe crime is up, even when official data shows it is down.\nIn 23 of 27 Gallup surveys conducted since 1993, at least 60% of U.S. adults have said there is more crime nationally than there was the year before, despite the downward trend in crime rates during most of that period.\nWhile perceptions of rising crime at the national level are common, fewer Americans believe crime is up in their own communities. In every Gallup crime survey since the 1990s, Americans have been much less likely to say crime is up in their area than to say the same about crime nationally.\nPublic attitudes about crime differ widely by Americans\u2019 party affiliation, race and ethnicity, and other factors. For example, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are much more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say reducing crime should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year (68% vs. 47%), according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.\nHow does crime in the U.S. differ by demographic characteristics?\nSome groups of Americans are more likely than others to be victims of crime. In the 2022 BJS survey, for example, younger people and those with lower incomes were far more likely to report being the victim of a violent crime than older and higher-income people.\nThere were no major differences in violent crime victimization rates between male and female respondents or between those who identified as White, Black or Hispanic. But the victimization rate among Asian Americans (a category that includes Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders) was substantially lower than among other racial and ethnic groups.\nThe same BJS survey asks victims about the demographic characteristics of the offenders in the incidents they experienced.\nIn 2022, those who are male, younger people and those who are Black accounted for considerably larger shares of perceived offenders in violent incidents than their respective shares of the U.S. population. Men, for instance, accounted for 79% of perceived offenders in violent incidents, compared with 49% of the nation\u2019s 12-and-older population that year. Black Americans accounted for 25% of perceived offenders in violent incidents, about twice their share of the 12-and-older population (12%).\nAs with all surveys, however, there are several potential sources of error, including the possibility that crime victims\u2019 perceptions about offenders are incorrect.\nHow does crime in the U.S. differ geographically?\nThere are big geographic differences in violent and property crime rates.\nFor example, in 2022, there were more than 700 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in New Mexico and Alaska. That compares with fewer than 200 per 100,000 people in Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine, according to the FBI.\nThe FBI notes that various factors might influence an area\u2019s crime rate, including its population density and economic conditions.\nWhat percentage of crimes are reported to police? What percentage are solved?\nMost violent and property crimes in the U.S. are not reported to police, and most of the crimes that are reported are not solved.\nIn its annual survey, BJS asks crime victims whether they reported their crime to police. It found that in 2022, only 41.5% of violent crimes and 31.8% of household property crimes were reported to authorities. BJS notes that there are many reasons why crime might not be reported, including fear of reprisal or of \u201cgetting the offender in trouble,\u201d a feeling that police \u201cwould not or could not do anything to help,\u201d or a belief that the crime is \u201ca personal issue or too trivial to report.\u201d\nMost of the crimes that are reported to police, meanwhile, are not solved, at least based on an FBI measure known as the clearance rate. That\u2019s the share of cases each year that are closed, or \u201ccleared,\u201d through the arrest, charging and referral of a suspect for prosecution, or due to \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances such as the death of a suspect or a victim\u2019s refusal to cooperate with a prosecution. In 2022, police nationwide cleared 36.7% of violent crimes that were reported to them and 12.1% of the property crimes that came to their attention.\nWhich crimes are most likely to be reported to police? Which are most likely to be solved?\nAround eight-in-ten motor vehicle thefts (80.9%) were reported to police in 2022, making them by far the most commonly reported property crime tracked by BJS. Household burglaries and trespassing offenses were reported to police at much lower rates (44.9% and 41.2%, respectively), while personal theft/larceny and other types of theft were only reported around a quarter of the time.\nAmong violent crimes \u2013 excluding homicide, which BJS doesn\u2019t track \u2013 robbery was the most likely to be reported to law enforcement in 2022 (64.0%). It was followed by aggravated assault (49.9%), simple assault (36.8%) and rape/sexual assault (21.4%).\nThe list of crimes cleared by police in 2022 looks different from the list of crimes reported. Law enforcement officers were generally much more likely to solve violent crimes than property crimes, according to the FBI.\nThe most frequently solved violent crime tends to be homicide. Police cleared around half of murders and nonnegligent manslaughters (52.3%) in 2022. The clearance rates were lower for aggravated assault (41.4%), rape (26.1%) and robbery (23.2%).\nWhen it comes to property crime, law enforcement agencies cleared 13.0% of burglaries, 12.4% of larcenies/thefts and 9.3% of motor vehicle thefts in 2022.\nAre police solving more or fewer crimes than they used to?\nNationwide clearance rates for both violent and property crime are at their lowest levels since at least 1993, the FBI data shows.\nPolice cleared a little over a third (36.7%) of the violent crimes that came to their attention in 2022, down from nearly half (48.1%) as recently as 2013. During the same period, there were decreases for each of the four types of violent crime the FBI tracks:\n- Police cleared 52.3% of reported murders and nonnegligent homicides in 2022, down from 64.1% in 2013.\n- They cleared 41.4% of aggravated assaults, down from 57.7%.\n- They cleared 26.1% of rapes, down from 40.6%.\n- They cleared 23.2% of robberies, down from 29.4%.\nThe pattern is less pronounced for property crime. Overall, law enforcement agencies cleared 12.1% of reported property crimes in 2022, down from 19.7% in 2013. The clearance rate for burglary didn\u2019t change much, but it fell for larceny/theft (to 12.4% in 2022 from 22.4% in 2013) and motor vehicle theft (to 9.3% from 14.2%).\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on Nov. 20, 2020."

      "text": "Americans\u2019 confidence in air travel safety dips slightly after Washington plane crash: AP-NORC poll\nAmericans\u2019 confidence in air travel safety dips slightly after Washington plane crash: AP-NORC poll\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Americans\u2019 confidence in air travel and the federal agencies tasked with maintaining air safety has slipped a little from last year, following a recent crash in Washington, according to a new poll, but most still believe air transportation is generally safe.\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 64% of U.S. adults say plane travel is \u201cvery safe\u201d or \u201csomewhat safe.\u201d That\u2019s down slightly from last year, when 71% said that. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults now say air transportation is very or somewhat unsafe, up from 12% in 2024.\nFaith in government agencies\u2019 ability to ensure safe air travel dipped as well. Just over half of U.S. adults have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of confidence in federal government agencies to maintain air safety, down slightly from about 6 in 10 last year.\nThe poll was conducted Feb. 6-10, shortly after the Jan. 30 collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter in Washington but before a Delta jet flipped on its roof while landing in Toronto. The Washington collision, which killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft, was the country\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster since 2001. The decline in confidence, while small, suggests that the event may have rattled some Americans. The 2024 poll was conducted after another incident that raised questions about the safety of air travel, in which a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner above Oregon, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.\nOverall, Americans think traveling by plane is about as safe as walking or taking a car. About two-thirds say either walking or driving are safe forms of transportation. Only about half of U.S. adults say a local subway, metro or light rail system is safe, in line with 2024.\nAfter the Washington crash, President Donald Trump, a Republican, blamed federal diversity and inclusion promotion efforts and reassured Americans that it is safe to fly. That may help explain why Democrats and independents, but not Republicans, have seen a drop in trust.\nIndependents\u2019 belief that plane travel is safe fell substantially, from about 6 in 10 calling it safe last year to about 4 in 10 now. About 7 in 10 Democrats say plane travel is safe, down slightly from about three-quarters in 2024. Republicans have not changed their views about air travel being safe.\nDemocrats and independents also have less faith in the government\u2019s ability to ensure air safety than they did four years ago. The poll was conducted before the firing of probationary Federal Aviation Administration employees, but at least some of the shift is likely related to the change in presidential administration, from Joe Biden, a Democrat, to Trump.\nIn January 2024, when Biden was still president, about 7 in 10 Democrats said they had high confidence in federal government agencies to maintain air safety. Now only 6 in 10 Democrats say that. Independents\u2019 confidence also declined, while Republicans\u2019 opinions did not move.\nThe poll found that U.S. adults\u2019 confidence in pilots and commercial airlines remains unchanged. About 8 in 10 U.S. adults have a high level of confidence in pilots, and about three-quarters say that about commercial airlines.\n___\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,112 adults was conducted Feb. 6-10, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points."

      "text": "The August 19 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and the protests that followed have focused attention on the militarization of police in the United States. Police overreach, especially in African-American neighborhoods, is nothing new: it was Marquette Frye\u2019s confrontation with California Highway Patrol officers on Aug. 11, 1965, that sparked the Watts Riots in Los Angeles almost half a century ago. But much has changed since the 1960s and 1970s: American police are a lot more militarized than they were back then, and many of the checks and balances that made the U.S. a democratic republic have been eroded by both courts and politicians. Here are 10 events of recent decades that have encouraged the growth of a police state in the U.S. and promoted the type of toxic environment in which unarmed Brown was shot six times.\nAlthough the war on drugs started under President Richard Nixon and continued under the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, it was expanded considerably during Ronald Reagan\u2019s two terms as president. Reagan proved to be much more draconian than Nixon, aggressively promoting militarized no-knock drug raids, asset forfeiture laws and mandatory minimum sentences, especially for crack cocaine. The drug war has greatly increased the prison population and placed a heavy burden on taxpayers, as well as imperiled many innocent Americans. Since the 1980s, there have been countless examples of narcotics officers targeting the wrong house or apartment for a no-knock SWAT raid, brandishing assault weapons and killing or injuring innocent people who had nothing to do with drugs. And when that happens, the officers hardly ever face incarceration or even civil charges.\nHistory repeats itself, and in 1992, 27 years after the Watts Riots, the acquittal of four white police officers who had viciously beaten Rodney King (an African-American motorist who led them on a high-speed chase) was followed by rioting that brought more deaths than the 1965 riots. King, by his own admission, was no saint, but a video of the March 3, 1991 beating clearly demonstrated that the officers crossed the line from legitimately subduing him (which they had every right to do) to being downright sadistic and acting in a spirit of revenge. Said then LA mayor Tom Bradley (a former LAPD lieutenant), \u201cThe men who beat Rodney King do not deserve to wear the uniform of the LAPD.\u201d Bradley\u2019s comments were hardly anti-law enforcement; he was proud of the years he had spent on the force. Rather, Bradley\u2019s point was that instead of letting King have his day in court, the officers acted as judge and jury. And their acquittal encouraged a climate of authoritarianism in the United States.\n3. 9/11 Terrorist Attacks\nWith the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaeda was hoping to destabilize the U.S. and weaken its standing in the world. And the George W. Bush administration played right into al-Qaeda\u2019s hands, promoting a climate of fear and intimidation with the blessing of a Republican-dominated Congress. The Bush years brought a variety of authoritarian, anti-Fourth Amendment measures, from the Patriot Act of 2001 to no-fly lists to the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. Instead of defying al-Qaeda by celebrating the U.S.\u2019 long tradition of constitutional law, the Bush administration made the war on terror a war on American democracy.\n4. Waterboarding and Torture at Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base\nAfter 9/11, the U.S. crossed a dangerous line when the CIA, with the blessing of the George W. Bush administration, openly supported the use of waterboarding on detainees at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. During the Cold War, the U.S. allied itself with a long list of fascist regimes that practiced torture. But it wasn\u2019t until the post-9/11 era that an American vice president, Dick Cheney, came right out and flaunted the use of torture by the U.S. government itself.\n5. Growth and Expansion of Asset Forfeiture Laws\nDuring the Ronald Reagan years, asset forfeiture laws were aggressively promoted as part of the war on drugs. But abuses in the name of asset forfeiture have become much more widespread since the 1980s, and there have been countless examples of police seizing property under the pretense that some type of crime might have been committed. If a motorist pulled over by police for having a broken taillight is carrying $600 in cash, the officer can confiscate that cash and claim there was reason to believe the money was being used in connection with a crime. Even if there is no arrest or evidence of wrongdoing and no charges are filed, the person still has to hire a lawyer to try getting the money back. The property is guilty until proven innocent. Civil forfeiture laws are an assault on the Fourth Amendment and in effect, turn American police departments into common thieves.\n6. National Defense Authorization Act and Erosion of Habeas Corpus\nHistorically, one of the many positive things about the U.S. was its recognition of habeas corpus, the right to be spared indefinite detention without a trial. But the National Defense Authorization Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law on Dec. 31, 2011, gives the U.S. military the right to detain U.S. citizens indefinitely without trial. If a U.S. citizen is declared an enemy combatant, indefinite detention without trial is possible. Journalists Chris Hedges and Noam Chomsky have both been part of an anti-NDAA lawsuit, arguing that the NDAA is an attack on Americans\u2019 right to habeas corpus.\n7. Department of Homeland Security Promoting Militarization of Local Police Departments\nThe militarization of American police departments escalated after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Department of Homeland Security launched a program that provides military surplus equipment to American police departments (including the type of weapons used by the U.S. soldiers in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan). Police departments in Des Moines, Iowa or Fargo, North Dakota now have the type of military weapons they didn\u2019t have access to in the past. This disturbing trend has continued in the Barack Obama era; in 2011, the Department of Homeland Security gave $2 billion in grants for local police departments to obtain military weapons.\n8. Growth of the Prison/Industrial Complex\nAnti-drug laws and prosecutions became much more draconian in the 1980s and \u201990s, turning imprisonment into a huge industry. From manufacturers of prison uniforms to companies that sell food to prisons, the prison-industrial complex has an interest in locking up as many people as possible. The U.S. incarcerates, per capita, more adults than any another country in the world (716 per 100,000 people in 2012 compared to only 79 per 100,000 in Germany or 82 per 100,000 in the Netherlands, according to the Center for Prison Studies in London). Especially disturbing are the growth of privately owned prisons, which the American Civil Liberties Union has vehemently opposed. In 2010, the ACLU sued the Nashville-based Corrections Corporation of America (the U.S.\u2019 largest private prison company) because of extremely violent conditions in one of its prisons, the Idaho Correctional Center. That year, ACLU senior attorney Stephen Pevar was quoted as saying that in his 39 years of suing prisons and jails, he had \u201cnever confronted a more disgraceful, and federal rights violations than this one.\u201d In 2013, a federal judge held the CCA in contempt of court for understaffing the Idaho Correctional Center.\n9. NYPD Assault On Occupy Wall Street\nOccupy Wall Street was (and still is) a peaceful movement that used nonviolent acts of civil disobedience to protest against the bailouts of large banks and the financial sector\u2019s assault on the American middle class. But the response of the New York Police Department to the Occupy protests of 2011 and 2012 was far from nonviolent, and the NYPD\u2019s heavy-handed treatment of the protestors sent out a message that challenging corporate power can be dangerous. Gerald Celente spoke the truth when he said that the NYPD had become, in effect, \u201cenforcers for the crime bosses\u201d (the crime bosses being the banksters and Wall Street). And the banksters enjoyed a major victory when Occupy activist Cecily McMillan was, in effect, incarcerated for challenging corporate power. McMillan was arrested on March 17, 2012 during a demonstration at New York City\u2019s Zuccotti Park, where she said that NYPD plainclothes officer Grantley Bovel forcefully grabbed her right breast from behind, and McMillan, not knowing he was a cop, responded by elbowing him in the face. McMillan was charged with assaulting a police officer, convicted and sentenced to three months at Rikers Island. The message was clear: protest Wall Street\u2019s criminality, and the consequences will be severe.\nThis article originally appeared on AlterNet"

      "text": "Gen Z has become lonely and antisocial. We have only ourselves to blame. | Opinion\nI'm not surprised that Gen Z has different drinking habits from other generations. I just wish we weren't so opposed to being social.\nOver the past several years, it has become apparent that Gen Z is pulling back from many of the social habits of previous generations.\nIn part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in part because of other cultural forces, Gen Z is rapidly becoming a more reclusive generation, and one that socializes differently. But now, it is becoming clear that young people are going out less and staying in more, in part because we are less inclined to drink alcohol.\nThe decision for Gen Z and all Americans to cut back on drinking isn\u2019t a bad thing, but young people need replacements for the social interactions that going to a bar or house party provides. We're becoming too isolated.\nGen Z does consume less alcohol, but we're also far less social\nAmericans are drinking less overall. While there are conflicting reports about Gen Z\u2019s unique habits, it is clear that we were ahead of the curve. While other age groups have seen declines in the number of people who say they drink over the past year, this decline has been consistent for those under 35 since the pandemic.\nI am one of those young people who forgoes drinking on a typical basis. I\u2019ll indulge here and there on special occasions, but I am far from a frequent drinker. Health reasons drive my decision-making, as they likely do for many sober-curious individuals out there. More Americans are realizing just how bad alcohol is for you, with Gen Z leading the charge.\nStill, I try to tag along with my friends even when they are drinking and I am not. Young people need to be more secure in their decision not to drink, rather than removing themselves from the situation altogether.\nGen Z has to find ways to become more social\nGeneration Z, born between 1997 to 2012, is dealing with loneliness and anti-dating epidemics. I don't think we need to drink more, but we have to stop pulling back socially. We're missing out on social settings, choosing instead to stay home.\nWe all know the likely causes. The crosswinds of the pandemic, work-from-home culture and a pullback from the bar scene have turned us into homebodies. What we don\u2019t know are the solutions. But we have to find some.\nYoung people need to become more involved in activities, whether that be community organizations or just doing something regularly with friends. Something has to fill the void that is left by our withdrawal from the bar and party scene. Something as simple as going out for a group dinner with friends, or doing something active with others, can go a long way.\nBelieve me, I understand that the bar scene is unattractive to many of us, and that trying to cut back on alcohol is a virtuous decision, but something has to replace the positive social benefits that alcohol provides. We can\u2019t all be homebodies \u2013 otherwise, the loneliness problems that our generation faces are likely to worsen.\nYoung people are approaching their social lives differently, but right now, it's hurting us. We all need to put in more effort in order to change that dynamic for the better.\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science."

      "text": "Why millennials are facing the scariest financial future of any generation since the Great Depression.\nLike everyone in my generation, I am finding it increasingly difficult not to be scared about the future and angry about the past.\nI am 35 years old\u2014the oldest millennial, the first millennial\u2014and for a decade now, I\u2019ve been waiting for adulthood to kick in. My rent consumes nearly half my income, I haven\u2019t had a steady job since Pluto was a planet and my savings are dwindling faster than the ice caps the baby boomers melted.\nWe\u2019ve all heard the statistics. More millennials live with their parents than with roommates. We are delaying partner-marrying and house-buying and kid-having for longer than any previous generation. And, according to The Olds, our problems are all our fault: We got the wrong degree. We spend money we don\u2019t have on things we don\u2019t need. We still haven\u2019t learned to code. We killed cereal and department stores and golf and napkins and lunch. Mention \u201cmillennial\u201d to anyone over 40 and the word \u201centitlement\u201d will come back at you within seconds, our own intergenerational game of Marco Polo.\nThis is what it feels like to be young now. Not only are we screwed, but we have to listen to lectures about our laziness and our participation trophies from the people who screwed us.\nBut generalizations about millennials, like those about any other arbitrarily defined group of 75 million people, fall apart under the slightest scrutiny. Contrary to the clich\u00e9, the vast majority of millennials did not go to college, do not work as baristas and cannot lean on their parents for help. Every stereotype of our generation applies only to the tiniest, richest, whitest sliver of young people. And the circumstances we live in are more dire than most people realize.\nWe've taken on at least 300% more student debt than our parents.\nSource: The College Board, Trends in Student Aid 2013. Calculations based on average per-student borrowing in 1980 and 2010.\nWe're about 1/2 as likely own a home as young adults were in 1975.\nSource: U.S. Census, young adults ages 24-35.\n1 in 5 of us is living in poverty.\nSource: U.S. Census, young adults ages 18-34.\nBased on current trends, many of us won't be able to reture until we're 75.\nSource: Projection for the class of 2015 based on a NerdWallet analysis of federal data.\nBut it\u2019s not just the numbers.\nWhat is different about us as individuals compared to previous generations is minor. What is different about the world around us is profound. Salaries have stagnated and entire sectors have cratered. At the same time, the cost of every prerequisite of a secure existence\u2014education, housing and health care\u2014has inflated into the stratosphere. From job security to the social safety net, all the structures that insulate us from ruin are eroding. And the opportunities leading to a middle-class life\u2014the ones that boomers lucked into\u2014are being lifted out of our reach. Add it all up and it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019re the first generation in modern history to end up poorer than our parents.\nThis is why the touchstone experience of millennials, the thing that truly defines us, is not helicopter parenting or unpaid internships or Pok\u00e9mon Go. It is uncertainty. \u201cSome days I breathe and it feels like something is about to burst out of my chest,\u201d says Jimmi Matsinger. \u201cI\u2019m 25 and I\u2019m still in the same place I was when I earned minimum wage.\u201d Four days a week she works at a dental office, Fridays she nannies, weekends she babysits. And still she couldn\u2019t keep up with her rent, car lease and student loans. Earlier this year she had to borrow money to file for bankruptcy. I heard the same walls-closing-in anxiety from millennials around the country and across the income scale, from cashiers in Detroit to nurses in Seattle.\nIt\u2019s tempting to look at the recession as the cause of all this, the Great Fuckening from which we are still waiting to recover. But what we are living through now, and what the recession merely accelerated, is a historic convergence of economic maladies, many of them decades in the making. Decision by decision, the economy has turned into a young people-screwing machine. And unless something changes, our calamity is going to become America\u2019s.\nUnderstanding structural disadvantage is pretty complicated. You\u2019ll need a guide.\nhat Scott remembers are the group interviews.\nEight, 10 people in suits, a circle of folding chairs, a chirpy HR rep with a clipboard. Each applicant telling her, one by one, in front of all the others, why he\u2019s the right candidate for this $11-an-hour job as a bank teller.\nIt was 2010, and Scott had just graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s in economics, a minor in business and $30,000 in student debt. At some of the interviews he was by far the least qualified person in the room. The other applicants described their corporate jobs and listed off graduate degrees. Some looked like they were in their 50s. \u201cOne time the HR rep told us she did these three times a week,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd I just knew I was never going to get a job.\u201d\nAfter six months of applying and interviewing and never hearing back, Scott returned to his high school job at The Old Spaghetti Factory. After that he bounced around\u2014selling suits at a Nordstrom outlet, cleaning carpets, waiting tables\u2014until he learned that city bus drivers earn $22 an hour and get full benefits. He\u2019s been doing that for a year now. It\u2019s the most money he\u2019s ever made. He still lives at home, chipping in a few hundred bucks every month to help his mom pay the rent.\nIn theory, Scott could apply for banking jobs again. But his degree is almost eight years old and he has no relevant experience. He sometimes considers getting a master\u2019s, but that would mean walking away from his salary and benefits for two years and taking on another five digits of debt\u2014just to snag an entry-level position, at the age of 30, that would pay less than he makes driving a bus. At his current job, he\u2019ll be able to move out in six months. And pay off his student loans in 20 years.\nThere are millions of Scotts in the modern economy. \u201cA lot of workers were just 18 at the wrong time,\u201d says William Spriggs, an economics professor at Howard University and an assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Labor in the Obama administration. \u201cEmployers didn\u2019t say, \u2018Oops, we missed a generation. In 2008 we weren\u2019t hiring graduates, let\u2019s hire all the people we passed over.\u2019 No, they hired the class of 2012.\u201d\nYou can even see this in the statistics, a divot from 2008 to 2012 where millions of jobs and billions in earnings should be. In 2007, more than 50 percent of college graduates had a job offer lined up. For the class of 2009, fewer than 20 percent of them did. According to a 2010 study, every 1 percent uptick in the unemployment rate the year you graduate college means a 6 to 8 percent drop in your starting salary\u2014a disadvantage that can linger for decades. The same study found that workers who graduated during the 1981 recession were still making less than their counterparts who graduated 10 years later. \u201cEvery recession,\u201d Spriggs says, \u201ccreates these cohorts that never recover.\u201d\nThe Class of Oh No\nHeaven help you if you graduated on the wrong side of the recession.\n\u201907 grad\u201909 gradOver 10 years, the typical \u201909 grad could earn up to0less than the typical \u201907 grad.\nBy now, those unlucky millennials who graduated at the wrong time have cascaded downward through the economy. Some estimates show that 48 percent of workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees are employed in jobs for which they\u2019re overqualified. A university diploma has practically become a prerequisite for even the lowest-paying positions, just another piece of paper to flash in front of the hiring manager at Quiznos.\nBut the real victims of this credential inflation are the two-thirds of millennials who didn\u2019t go to college. Since 2010, the economy has added 11.6 million jobs\u2014and 11.5 million of them have gone to workers with at least some college education. In 2016, young workers with a high school diploma had roughly triple the unemployment rate and three and a half times the poverty rate of college grads.\nOnce you start tracing these trends backward, the recession starts to look less like a temporary setback and more like a culmination. Over the last 40 years, as politicians and parents and perky magazine listicles have been telling us to study hard and build our personal brands, the entire economy has transformed beneath us.\nFor decades, most of the job growth in America has been in low-wage, low-skilled, temporary and short-term jobs. The United States simply produces fewer and fewer of the kinds of jobs our parents had. This explains why the rates of \u201cunder-employment\u201d among high school and college grads were rising steadily long before the recession. \u201cThe way to think about it,\u201d says Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist and author of The Great Risk Shift, \u201cis that there are waves in the economy, but the tide has been going out for a long time.\u201d\nThe decline of the job has its primary origins in the 1970s, with a million little changes the boomers barely noticed. The Federal Reserve cracked down on inflation. Companies started paying executives in stock options. Pension funds invested in riskier assets. The cumulative result was money pouring into the stock market like jet fuel. Between 1960 and 2013, the average time that investors held stocks before flipping them went from eight years to around four months. Over roughly the same period, the financial sector became a sarlacc pit encompassing around a quarter of all corporate profits and completely warping companies\u2019 incentives.\nThe pressure to deliver immediate returns became relentless. When stocks were long-term investments, shareholders let CEOs spend money on things like worker benefits because they contributed to the company\u2019s long-term health. Once investors lost the ability to look beyond the next earnings report, however, any move that didn\u2019t boost short-term profits was tantamount to treason.\nThe new paradigm took over corporate America. Private equity firms and commercial banks took corporations off the market, laid off or outsourced workers, then sold the businesses back to investors. In the 1980s alone, a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 were restructured. Companies were no longer single entities with responsibilities to their workers, retirees or communities.\nBusinesses applied the same chop-shop logic to their own operations. Executives came to see themselves as first and foremost in the shareholder-pleasing game. Higher staff salaries became luxuries to be slashed. Unions, the great negotiators of wages and benefits and the guarantors of severance pay, became enemy combatants. And eventually, employees themselves became liabilities. \u201cCorporations decided that the fastest way to a higher stock price was hiring part-time workers, lowering wages and turning their existing employees into contractors,\u201d says Rosemary Batt, a Cornell University economist.\nThirty years ago, she says, you could walk into any hotel in America and everyone in the building, from the cleaners to the security guards to the bartenders, was a direct hire, each worker on the same pay scale and enjoying the same benefits as everyone else. Today, they\u2019re almost all indirect hires, employees of random, anonymous contracting companies: Laundry Inc., Rent-A-Guard Inc., Watery Margarita Inc. In 2015, the Government Accountability Office estimated that 40 percent of American workers were employed under some sort of \u201ccontingent\u201d arrangement like this\u2014from barbers to midwives to nuclear waste inspectors to symphony cellists. Since the downturn, the industry that has added the most jobs is not tech or retail or nursing. It is \u201ctemporary help services\u201d\u2014all the small, no-brand contractors who recruit workers and rent them out to bigger companies.\nThe effect of all this \u201cdomestic outsourcing\u201d\u2014and, let\u2019s be honest, its actual purpose\u2014is that workers get a lot less out of their jobs than they used to. One of Batt\u2019s papers found that employees lose up to 40 percent of their salary when they\u2019re \u201cre-classified\u201d as contractors. In 2013, the city of Memphis reportedly cut wages from $15 an hour to $10 after it fired its school bus drivers and forced them to reapply through a staffing agency. Some Walmart \u201clumpers,\u201d the warehouse workers who carry boxes from trucks to shelves, have to show up every morning but only get paid if there\u2019s enough work for them that day.\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s really driving wage inequality,\u201d says David Weil, the former head of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor and the author of The Fissured Workplace. \u201cBy shifting tasks to contractors, companies pay a price for a service rather than wages for work. That means they don\u2019t have to think about training, career advancement or benefit provision.\u201d\nThis transformation is affecting the entire economy, but millennials are on its front lines. Where previous generations were able to amass years of solid experience and income in the old economy, many of us will spend our entire working lives intermittently employed in the new one. We\u2019ll get less training and fewer opportunities to negotiate benefits through unions (which used to cover 1 in 3 workers and are now down to around 1 in 10). Plus, as Uber and its \u201cgig economy\u201d ilk perfect their algorithms, we\u2019ll be increasingly at the mercy of companies that only want to pay us for the time we\u2019re generating revenue and not a second more.\nBut the blame doesn\u2019t only fall on companies. Trade groups have responded to the dwindling number of secure jobs by digging a moat around the few that are left. Over the last 30 years, they\u2019ve successfully lobbied state governments to require occupational licenses for dozens of jobs that never used to need them. It makes sense: The harder it is to become a plumber, the fewer plumbers there will be and the more each of them can charge. Nearly a third of American workers now need some kind of state license to do their jobs, compared to less than 5 percent in 1950. In most other developed countries, you don\u2019t need official permission to cut hair or pour drinks. Here, those jobs can require up to $20,000 in schooling and 2,100 hours of instruction and unpaid practice.\nIn sum, nearly every path to a stable income now demands tens of thousands of dollars before you get your first paycheck or have any idea whether you\u2019ve chosen the right career path. \u201cI was literally paying to work,\u201d says Elena, a 29-year-old dietician in Texas. (I\u2019ve changed the names of some of the people in this story because they don't want to get fired.) As part of her master\u2019s degree, she was required to do a yearlong \u201cinternship\u201d in a hospital. It was supposed to be training, but she says she worked the same hours and did the same tasks as paid staffers. \u201cI took out an extra $20,000 in student loans to pay tuition for the year I was working for free,\u201d she says.\nAll of these trends\u2014the cost of education, the rise of contracting, the barriers to skilled occupations\u2014add up to an economy that has deliberately shifted the risk of economic recession and industry disruption away from companies and onto individuals. For our parents, a job was a guarantee of a secure adulthood. For us, it is a gamble. And if we suffer a setback along the way, there\u2019s so little to keep us from sliding into disaster.\nBecoming poor is not an event. It is a process.\nLike a plane crash, poverty is rarely caused by one thing going wrong. Usually, it is a series of misfortunes\u2014a job loss, then a car accident, then an eviction\u2014that interact and compound.\nI heard the most acute description of how this happens from Anirudh Krishna, a Duke University professor who has, over the last 15 years, interviewed more than 1,000 people who fell into poverty and escaped it. He started in India and Kenya, but eventually, his grad students talked him into doing the same thing in North Carolina. The mechanism, he discovered, was the same.\nWe often think of poverty in America as a pool, a fixed portion of the population that remains destitute for years. In fact, Krishna says, poverty is more like a lake, with streams flowing steadily in and out all the time. \u201cThe number of people in danger of becoming poor is far larger than the number of people who are actually poor,\u201d he says.\nWe\u2019re all living in a state of permanent volatility. Between 1970 and 2002, the probability that a working-age American would unexpectedly lose at least half her family income more than doubled. And the danger is particularly severe for young people. In the 1970s, when the boomers were our age, young workers had a 24 percent chance of falling below the poverty line. By the 1990s, that had risen to 37 percent. And the numbers only seem to be getting worse. From 1979 to 2014, the poverty rate among young workers with only a high school diploma more than tripled, to 22 percent. \u201cMillennials feel like they can lose everything at any time,\u201d Hacker says. \u201cAnd, increasingly, they can.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what that downward slide looks like. Gabriel is 19 years old and lives in a small town in Oregon. He plays the piano and, until recently, was saving up to study music at an arts college. Last summer he was working at a health supplement company. It wasn\u2019t the most glamorous job, lugging boxes and blending ingredients, but he made $12.50 an hour and he hoped he could step up to a better position if he proved himself.\nThen his sister got into a car accident, T-boned turning into their driveway. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t walk; she couldn\u2019t think,\u201d Gabriel says. His mom wasn't able to take a day off without risking losing her job, so Gabriel called his boss and left a message saying he had to miss work for a day to get his sister home from the hospital.\nThe next day, his temp agency called: He was fired. Though Gabriel says no one had told him, the company had a three-strikes policy for unplanned absences. He had already missed one day for a cold and another for a staph infection, so this was it. A former colleague told him that his absences meant he was unlikely to get a job there again.\nSo now Gabriel works at Taco Time and lives in a trailer with his mom and his sisters. Most of his paycheck goes to gas and groceries because his mom\u2019s income is disappearing into the family\u2019s medical bills. He still wants to go to college. But since he can barely keep his head above water, he\u2019s set his sights on an electrician\u2019s apprenticeship program offered by a local nonprofit. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so hard to do something with your life,\u201d he tells me.\nThe answer is brutally simple. In an economy where wages are precarious and the safety net has been hacked into ribbons, one piece of bad luck can easily become a years-long struggle to get back to normal.\nOver the last four decades, there has been a profound shift in the relationship between the government and its citizens. In The Age of Responsibility, Yascha Mounk, a political theorist, writes that before the 1980s, the idea of \u201cresponsibility\u201d was understood as something each American owed to the people around them, a national project to keep the most vulnerable from falling below basic subsistence. Even Richard Nixon, not exactly known for lifting up the downtrodden, proposed a national welfare benefit and a version of a guaranteed income. But under Ronald Reagan and then Bill Clinton, the meaning of \u201cresponsibility\u201d changed. It became individualized, a duty to earn the benefits your country offered you.\nSince 1996, the percentage of poor families receiving cash assistance from the government has fallen from 68 percent to 23 percent. No state provides cash benefits that add up to the poverty line. Eligibility criteria have been surgically tightened, often with requirements that are counterproductive to actually escaping poverty. Take Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which ostensibly supports poor families with children. Its predecessor (with a different acronym) had the goal of helping parents of kids under 7, usually through simple cash payments. These days, those benefits are explicitly geared toward getting mothers away from their children and into the workforce as soon as possible. A few states require women to enroll in training or start applying for jobs the day after they give birth.\nThe list goes on. Housing assistance, for many people the difference between losing a job and losing everything, has been slashed into oblivion. (To pick just one example, in 2014 Baltimore had 75,000 applicants for 1,500 rental vouchers.) Food stamps, the closest thing to universal benefits we have left, provide, on average, $1.40 per meal.\nIn what seems like some kind of perverse joke, nearly every form of welfare now available to young people is attached to traditional employment. Unemployment benefits and workers\u2019 compensation are limited to employees. The only major expansions of welfare since 1980 have been to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, both of which pay wages back to workers who have already collected them.\nBack when we had decent jobs and strong unions, it (kind of) made sense to provide things like health care and retirement savings through employer benefits. But now, for freelancers and temps and short-term contractors\u2014i.e., us\u2014those benefits might as well be Monopoly money. Forty-one percent of working millennials aren\u2019t even eligible for retirement plans through their companies.\nAnd then there\u2019s health care.\nIn 1980, 4 out of 5 employees got health insurance through their jobs. Now, just over half of them do. Millennials can stay on our parents\u2019 plans until we turn 26. But the cohort right afterward, 26- to 34-year-olds, has the highest uninsured rate in the country and millennials\u2014alarmingly\u2014have more collective medical debt than the boomers. Even Obamacare, one of the few expansions of the safety net since man walked on the moon, still leaves us out in the open. Millennials who can afford to buy plans on the exchanges face premiums (next year mine will be $388 a month), deductibles ($850) and out-of-pocket limits ($5,000) that, for many young people, are too high to absorb without help. And of the events that precipitate the spiral into poverty, according to Krishna, an injury or illness is the most common trigger.\n\u201cAll of us are one life event away from losing everything,\u201d says Ashley Lauber, a bankruptcy lawyer in Seattle and an Old Millennial like me. For most of her clients under 35, she says, the slide toward bankruptcy starts with a car accident or a medical bill. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford your deductible, so you go to Moneytree and take out a loan for a few hundred bucks. Then you miss your payments and the collectors start calling you at work, telling your boss you can\u2019t pay. Then he gets sick of it and he fires you and it all gets worse.\u201d For a lot of her millennial clients, Lauber says, the difference between escaping debt and going bankrupt comes down to the only safety net they have\u2014their parents.\nBut this fail-safe, like all the others, isn\u2019t equally available to everyone. The wealth gap between white and non-white families is massive. Since basically forever, almost every avenue of wealth creation\u2014higher education, homeownership, access to credit\u2014has been denied to minorities through discrimination both obvious and invisible. And the disparity has only grown wider since the recession. From 2007 to 2010, black families\u2019 retirement accounts shrank by 35 percent, whereas white families, who are more likely to have other sources of money, saw their accounts grow by 9 percent.\nThe result is that millennials of color are even more exposed to disaster than their peers. Many white millennials have an iceberg of accumulated wealth from their parents and grandparents that they can draw on for help with tuition, rent or a place to stay during an unpaid internship. According to the Institute on Assets and Social Policy, white Americans are five times more likely to receive an inheritance than black Americans\u2014which can be enough to make a down payment on a house or pay off student loans. By contrast, 67 percent of black families and 71 percent of Latino families don\u2019t have enough money saved to cover three months of living expenses.\nAnd so, instead of receiving help from their families, millennials of color are more likely to be called on to provide it. Any extra income from a new job or a raise tends to get swallowed by bills or debts that many white millennials had help with. Four years after graduation, black college graduates have, on average, nearly twice as much student debt as their white counterparts and are three times more likely to be behind on payments. This financial undertow is captured in one staggering statistic: Every extra dollar of income earned by a middle-class white family generates $5.19 in new wealth. For black families, it\u2019s 69 cents.\nArc of Injustice\nThe racial wealth gap isn't just glaring. It's growing.\nBlack WealthWhite WealthThe median white household will have1015166986more wealth than the median black household by 2020.\nWant to get even more depressed? Sit down and think about what\u2019s going to happen to us when we get old. Despite all the stories you read about flighty millennials refusing to plan for retirement (as if our grandparents were obsessing over the details of their pension plans when they were 25), the biggest problem we face is not financial illiteracy. It is compound interest.\nIn the coming decades, the returns on 401(k) plans are expected to fall by half. According to an analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a drop in stock market returns of just 2 percentage points means a 25-year-old would have to contribute more than double the amount to her retirement savings that a boomer did. Oh, and she'll have to do it on lower wages. This scenario gets even more dire when you consider what's going to happen to Social Security by the time we make it to 65. There, too, it seems inevitable that we\u2019re going to get screwed by demography: In 1950, there were 17 American workers to support each retiree. When millennials retire, there will be just two.\nThere\u2019s one way that many Americans have traditionally managed to build wealth for themselves, to achieve some kind of dignity and comfort in old age. I\u2019m talking, of course, about homeownership. At least we\u2019ve got a shot at that, right?\nWhenever Tyrone moves into a new apartment, he lies down naked on his living room floor.\nIt\u2019s a ritual, a reminder of the years he spent without a floor underneath him or a ceiling above. He was homeless for four years in Georgia: sleeping on benches, biking to interviews in the heat, arriving an hour early so he wouldn\u2019t be sweaty for the handshake. When he finally got a job, his co-workers found out that he washed himself in gas station bathrooms and made him so miserable he quit. \u201cThey said I \u2018smelled homeless,\u2019\u201d he says.\nTyrone moved to Seattle six years ago, when he was 23, because he\u2019d heard the minimum wage there was almost double what he made in Atlanta. He got a job at a grocery store and slept in a shelter while he saved. Since then, his income has gone up, but he\u2019s been pushed farther and farther from the city. First stop was subsidized housing in Kirkland, 20 minutes east across the lake. Then a rented house in Tacoma, 45 minutes south, sharing a bedroom with his girlfriend and, eventually, a son. The breakup is why he\u2019s now in Lakewood, even farther south, in a one-bedroom right next to a freeway entrance.\nAnd it\u2019s already such a strain. Tyrone earns $17 an hour as a security guard at a building site, his highest wage ever. But he\u2019s a contractor (of course), so he doesn\u2019t get sick leave or health insurance. His rent is $1,100 a month. It\u2019s more than he can afford, but he could only find one building that would let him move in without paying the full deposit in advance.\nSince rent is due on the 1st and he gets paid on the 7th, his landlord adds a $100 late fee to each month\u2019s bill. After that and the car payments\u2014it\u2019s a two-hour bus ride from the suburb where he lives to the suburb where he works\u2014he has $200 left over every month for food. The first time we met, it was the 27th of the month and Tyrone told me his account was already zeroed out. He had pawned his skateboard the previous night for gas money.\nDespite the acres of news pages dedicated to the narrative that millennials refuse to grow up, there are twice as many young people like Tyrone\u2014living on their own and earning less than $30,000 per year\u2014as there are millennials living with their parents. The crisis of our generation cannot be separated from the crisis of affordable housing.\nMore people are renting homes than at any time since the late 1960s. But in the 40 years leading up to the recession, rents increased at more than twice the rate of incomes. Between 2001 and 2014, the number of \u201cseverely burdened\u201d renters\u2014households spending over half their incomes on rent\u2014grew by more than 50 percent. Rather unsurprisingly, as housing prices have exploded, the number of 30- to 34-year-olds who own homes has plummeted.\nFalling homeownership rates, on their own, aren\u2019t necessarily a catastrophe. But our country has contrived an entire \u201cGame of Life\u201d sequence that hinges on being able to buy a home. You rent for a while to save up for a down payment, then you buy a starter home with your partner, then you move into a larger place and raise a family. Once you pay off the mortgage, your house is either an asset to sell or a cheap place to live in retirement. Fin.\nThis worked well when rents were low enough to save and homes were cheap enough to buy. In one of the most infuriating conversations I had for this article, my father breezily informed me that he bought his first house at 29. It was 1973, he had just moved to Seattle and his job as a university professor paid him (adjusted for inflation) around $76,000 a year. The house cost $124,000 \u2014 again, in today\u2019s dollars. I am six years older now than my dad was then. I earn less than he did and the median home price in Seattle is around $730,000. My father\u2019s first house cost him 20 months of his salary. My first house will cost more than 10 years of mine.\nFor a long time, that\u2019s what cities did. They built upward, divided homes into apartments and added duplexes and townhomes.\nBut in the 1970s, they stopped building. Cities kept adding jobs and people. But they didn\u2019t add more housing. And that\u2019s when prices started to climb.\nSo much of this can be explained by one word:\nAt first, zoning was pretty modest. The point was to stop someone from buying your neighbor\u2019s house and turning it into an oil refinery.\nBut eventually people realized they could use zoning for other purposes.\nIn the late 1960s, it finally became illegal to deny housing to minorities. So cities instituted weirdly specific rules that drove up the price of new houses and excluded poor people\u2014who were, disproportionately, minorities.\nHouses had to have massive backyards. They couldn\u2019t be split into separate apartments. Basically, cities mandated McMansions.\nWe\u2019re still living with that legacy. Across huge swaths of American cities, it\u2019s pretty much illegal to build affordable housing.\nAnd this problem is only getting worse.\nThat\u2019s because all the urgency to build comes from people who need somewhere to live. But all the political power is held by people who already own homes.\nFor homeowners, there\u2019s no such thing as a housing crisis.\nWhy?\nBecause when property values go up, so does their net worth. They have every reason to block new construction.\nThey do that by weaponizing environmental regulations and historical preservation rules.\nThey force buildings to be shorter so they don\u2019t cast shadows. They demand two parking spaces for every single unit.\nThey complain that a new apartment building will destroy \u201cneighborhood character\u201d when the structure it\u2019s replacing is\u2026 a parking garage. (True story.)\nAll this extra hassle means construction takes longer and costs more.\nWhich means that the only way most developers can make a profit is to build luxury condos.\nSo that\u2019s why cities are so unaffordable. The entire system is structured to produce expensive housing when we desperately need the opposite.\nThe housing crisis in our most prosperous cities is now distorting the entire American economy. For most of the 20th century, the way many workers improved their financial fortunes was to move closer to opportunities. Rents were higher in the boomtowns, but so were wages.\nSince the Great Recession, the \u201cgood\u201d jobs\u2014secure, non-temp, decent salary\u2014have concentrated in cities like never before. America\u2019s 100 largest metros have added 6 million jobs since the downturn. Rural areas, meanwhile, still have fewer jobs than they did in 2007. For young people trying to find work, moving to a major city is not an indulgence. It is a virtual necessity.\nBut the soaring rents in big cities are now canceling out the higher wages. Back in 1970, according to a Harvard study, an unskilled worker who moved from a low-income state to a high-income state kept 79 percent of his increased wages after he paid for housing. A worker who made the same move in 2010 kept just 36 percent. For the first time in U.S. history, says Daniel Shoag, one of the study\u2019s co-authors, it no longer makes sense for an unskilled worker in Utah to head for New York in the hope of building a better life.\nThis leaves young people, especially those without a college degree, with an impossible choice. They can move to a city where there are good jobs but insane rents. Or they can move somewhere with low rents but few jobs that pay above the minimum wage.\nThis dilemma is feeding the inequality-generating woodchipper the U.S. economy has become. Rather than offering Americans a way to build wealth, cities are becoming concentrations of people who already have it. In the country\u2019s 10 largest metros, residents earning more than $150,000 per year now outnumber those earning less than $30,000 per year.\nMillennials who are able to relocate to these oases of opportunity get to enjoy their many advantages: better schools, more generous social services, more rungs on the career ladder to grab on to. Millennials who can\u2019t afford to relocate to a big expensive city are \u2026 stuck. In 2016, the Census Bureau reported that young people were less likely to have lived at a different address a year earlier than at any time since 1963.\nAnd so the real reason millennials can\u2019t seem to achieve the adulthood our parents envisioned for us is that we\u2019re trying to succeed within a system that no longer makes any sense. Homeownership and migration have been pitched to us as gateways to prosperity because, back when the boomers grew up, they were. But now, the rules have changed and we\u2019re left playing a game that is impossible to win.\nWhich means\nWe start earning less money, later. We have more debt and higher rent.\nwe aren\u2019t able to save.\nwe can\u2019t buy a house or prepare for retirement.\nthat unless something changes\u2026All of us are headed for a very dark place.\nThe most striking thing about the problems of millennials is how intertwined and self-reinforcing and everywhere they are.\nOver the eight months I spent reporting this story, I spent a few evenings at a youth homeless shelter and met unpaid interns and gig-economy bike messengers saving for their first month of rent. During the days I interviewed people like Josh, a 33-year-old affordable housing developer who mentioned that his mother struggles to make ends meet as a contractor in a profession that used to be reliable government work. Every Thanksgiving, she reminds him that her retirement plan is a \u201c401(j)\u201d\u2014J for Josh.\nFixing what has been done to us is going to take more than tinkering. Even if economic growth picks up and unemployment continues to fall, we\u2019re still on a track toward ever more insecurity for young people. The \u201cLeave It To Beaver\u201d workforce, in which everyone has the same job from graduation until gold watch, is not coming back. Any attempt to recreate the economic conditions the boomers had is just sending lifeboats to a whirlpool.\nBut still, there is already a foot-long list of overdue federal policy changes that would at least begin to fortify our future and reknit the safety net. Even amid the awfulness of our political moment, we can start to build a platform to rally around. Raise the minimum wage and tie it to inflation. Roll back anti-union laws to give workers more leverage against companies that treat them as if they\u2019re disposable. Tilt the tax code away from the wealthy. Right now, rich people can write off mortgage interest on their second home and expenses related to being a landlord or (I'm not kidding) owning a racehorse. The rest of us can\u2019t even deduct student loans or the cost of getting an occupational license.\nSome of the trendiest Big Policy Fixes these days are efforts to rebuild government services from the ground up. The ur-example is the Universal Basic Income, a no-questions-asked monthly cash payment to every single American. The idea is to establish a level of basic subsistence below which no one in a civilized country should be allowed to fall. The venture capital firm Y Combinator is planning a pilot program that would give $1,000 each month to 1,000 low- and middle-income participants. And while, yes, it\u2019s inspiring that a pro-poor policy idea has won the support of D.C. wonks and Ayn Rand tech bros alike, it\u2019s worth noting that existing programs like food stamps, TANF, public housing and government-subsidized day care are not inherently ineffective. They have been intentionally made so. It would be nice if the people excited by the shiny new programs would expend a little effort defending and expanding the ones we already have.\nBut they\u2019re right about one thing: We\u2019re going to need government structures that respond to the way we work now. \u201cPortable benefits,\u201d an idea that\u2019s been bouncing around for years, attempts to break down the zero-sum distinction between full-time employees who get government-backed worker protections and independent contractors who get nothing. The way to solve this, when you think about it, is ridiculously simple: Attach benefits to work instead of jobs. The existing proposals vary, but the good ones are based on the same principle: For every hour you work, your boss chips in to a fund that pays out when you get sick, pregnant, old or fired. The fund follows you from job to job, and companies have to contribute to it whether you work there a day, a month or a year.\nSmall-scale versions of this idea have been offsetting the inherent insecurity of the gig economy since long before we called it that. Some construction workers have an \u201chour bank\u201d that fills up when they\u2019re working and provides benefits even when they\u2019re between jobs. Hollywood actors and technical staff have health and pension plans that follow them from movie to movie. In both cases, the benefits are negotiated by unions, but they don\u2019t have to be. Since 1962, California has offered \u201celective coverage\u201d insurance that allows independent contractors to file for payouts if their kids get sick or if they get injured on the job. \u201cThe offloading of risks onto workers and families was not a natural occurrence,\u201d says Hacker, the Yale political scientist. \u201cIt was a deliberate effort. And we can roll it back the same way.\u201d\nAnother no-brainer experiment is to expand jobs programs. As decent opportunities have dwindled and wage inequality has soared, the government\u2019s message to the poorest citizens has remained exactly the same: You\u2019re not trying hard enough. But at the same time, the government has not actually attempted to give people jobs on a large scale since the 1970s.\nBecause most of us grew up in a world without them, jobs programs can sound overly ambitious or suspiciously Leninist. In fact, they\u2019re neither. In 2010, as part of the stimulus, Mississippi launched a program that simply reimbursed employers for the wages they paid to eligible new hires\u2014100 percent at first, then tapering down to 25 percent. The initiative primarily reached low-income mothers and the long-term unemployed. Nearly half of the recipients were under 30.\nThe results were impressive. For the average participant, the subsidized wages lasted only 13 weeks. Yet the year after the program ended, long-term unemployed workers were still earning nearly nine times more than they had the previous year. Either they kept the jobs they got through the subsidies or the experience helped them find something new. Plus, the program was a bargain. Subsidizing more than 3,000 jobs cost $22 million, which existing businesses doled out to workers who weren\u2019t required to get special training. It wasn\u2019t an isolated success, either. A Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality review of 15 jobs programs from the past four decades concluded that they were \u201ca proven, promising, and underutilized tool for lifting up disadvantaged workers.\u201d The review found that subsidizing employment raised wages and reduced long-term unemployment. Children of the participants even did better at school.\nBut before I get carried away listing urgent and obvious solutions for the plight of millennials, let\u2019s pause for a bit of reality: Who are we kidding? Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are not interested in our innovative proposals to lift up the systemically disadvantaged. Their entire political agenda, from the Scrooge McDuck tax reform bill to the ongoing assassination attempt on Obamacare, is explicitly designed to turbocharge the forces that are causing this misery. Federally speaking, things are only going to get worse.\nWhich is why, for now, we need to take the fight to where we can win it.\nOver the last decade, states and cities have made remarkable progress adapting to the new economy. Minimum-wage hikes have been passed by voters in nine states, even dark red rectangles like Nebraska and South Dakota. Following a long campaign by the Working Families Party and other activist organizations, eight states and the District of Columbia have instituted guaranteed sick leave. Bills to combat exploitative scheduling practices have been introduced in more than a dozen state legislatures. San Francisco now gives retail and fast-food workers the right to learn their schedules two weeks in advance and get compensated for sudden shift changes. Local initiatives are popular, effective and our best hope of preventing the country\u2019s slide into \u201cMad Max\u201d-style individualism.\nThe court system, the only branch of our government currently functioning, offers other encouraging avenues. Class-action lawsuits and state and federal investigations have resulted in a wave of judgments against companies that \u201cmisclassify\u201d their workers as contractors. FedEx, which requires some of its drivers to buy their own trucks and then work as independent contractors, recently reached a $227 million settlement with more than 12,000 plaintiffs in 19 states. In 2014, a startup called Hello Alfred\u2014Uber for chores, basically\u2014announced that it would rely exclusively on direct hires instead of \u201c1099s.\u201d Part of the reason, its CEO told Fast Company, was that the legal and financial risk of relying on contractors had gotten too high. A tsunami of similar lawsuits over working conditions and wage theft would be enough to force the same calculation onto every CEO in America.\nAnd then there\u2019s housing, where the potential\u2014and necessity\u2014of local action is obvious. This doesn\u2019t just mean showing up to city council hearings to drown out the NIMBYs (though let\u2019s definitely do that). It also means ensuring that the entire system for approving new construction doesn\u2019t prioritize homeowners at the expense of everyone else. Right now, permitting processes examine, in excruciating detail, how one new building will affect rents, noise, traffic, parking, shadows and squirrel populations. But they never investigate the consequences of not building anything\u2014rising prices, displaced renters, low-wage workers commuting hours from outside the sprawl.\nSome cities are finally acknowledging this reality. Portland and Denver have sped up approvals and streamlined permitting. In 2016, Seattle\u2019s mayor announced that the city would cut ties with its mostly old, mostly white, very NIMBY district councils and establish a \u201ccommunity involvement commission.\u201d The name is terrible, obviously, but the mandate is groundbreaking: Include renters, the poor, ethnic minorities\u2014and everyone else unable to attend a consultation at 2 p.m. on a Wednesday\u2014in construction decisions. For decades, politicians have been terrified of making the slightest twitch that might upset homeowners. But with renters now outnumbering owners in nine of America\u2019s 11 largest cities, we have the potential to be a powerful political constituency.\nThe same logic could be applied to our entire generation. In 2018, there will be more millennials than boomers in the voting-age population. The problem, as you\u2019ve already heard a million times, is that we don\u2019t vote enough. Only 49 percent of Americans ages 18 to 35 turned out to vote in the last presidential election, compared to about 70 percent of boomers and Greatests. (It\u2019s lower in midterm elections and positively dire in primaries.)\nBut like everything about millennials, once you dig into the numbers you find a more complicated story. Youth turnout is low, sure, but not universally. In 2012, it ranged from 68 percent in Mississippi (!) to 24 percent in West Virginia. And across the country, younger Americans who are registered to vote show up at the polls nearly as often as older Americans.\nThe fact is, it\u2019s simply harder for us to vote. Consider that nearly half of millennials are minorities and that voter suppression efforts are laser-focused on blacks and Latinos. Or that the states with the simplest registration procedures have youth turnout rates significantly higher than the national average. (In Oregon it\u2019s automatic, in Idaho you can do it the same day you vote and in North Dakota you don\u2019t have to register at all.) Adopting voting rights as a cause\u2014forcing politicians to listen to us like they do to the boomers\u2014is the only way we\u2019re ever going to get a shot at creating our own New Deal.\nOr, as Shaun Scott, the author of Millennials and the Moments That Made Us, told me, \u201cWe can either do politics or we can have politics done to us.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s exactly it. The boomer-benefiting system we\u2019ve inherited was not inevitable and it is not irreversible. There is still a choice here. For the generations ahead of us, it is whether to pass down some of the opportunities they enjoyed in their youth or to continue hoarding them. Since 1989, the median wealth of families headed by someone over 62 has increased 40 percent. The median wealth of families headed by someone under 40 has decreased by 28 percent. Boomers, it's up to you: Do you want your children to have decent jobs and places to live and a non-Dickensian old age? Or do you want lower taxes and more parking?\nThen there\u2019s our responsibility. We\u2019re used to feeling helpless because for most of our lives we\u2019ve been subject to huge forces beyond our control. But pretty soon, we\u2019ll actually be in charge. And the question, as we age into power, is whether our children will one day write the same article about us. We can let our economic infrastructure keep disintegrating and wait to see if the rising seas get us before our social contract dies. Or we can build an equitable future that reflects our values and our demographics and all the chances we wish we'd had. Maybe that sounds na\u00efve, and maybe it is. But I think we're entitled to it.\nCredits\nHe is also a part of the lettering sketch blog Friends of Type."

      "text": "Peak oil, a hypothetical point when global oil production maximizes and enters an irreversible decline, has been the holy grail of resource economics for decades: prized and just as elusive. Recently, technological development including increased digitization has altered conventional understandings associated with \u201cpeak oil\u201d. Like other consumable resources, peak oil is grounded in reality: Oil is a finite natural resource produced over a geological timespan whereas demand continues to climb. However, peak oil could also become a self-fulfilling prophecy, inadvertently misinforming the public.\nWhen this author was about 10 (more than 50 years ago), his father, an oil and gas Ph.D. geologist, told him that we will run out of oil, as all major fields have been already discovered.\nHow we react to this prophecy will determine a lot about decarbonization and the energy transition.\nNobody can quite agree on when we will reach the point of Peak Oil or even what will cause it. Norwegian state-owned oil company Equinor and energy researcher Rystad Energy predict a peak around 2028 owing to low investments in oil supply and increasingly efficient competition from renewable energy projects. McKinsey Consulting and French oil and gas company TotalEnergies, estimate peak oil in the early and mid-2030s respectively due to slow growth in the chemical industries as well as peak transport demand.\nA recent OPEC outlook report estimated steadily increasing demand, which would result in peak oil in approximately 2040. The International Energy Agency and U.S. Energy Information Agency foresee oil demand \u201cplateauing\u201d and recommend immediately exploring alternatives to sustain energy needs. According to BP\u2019s outlook, international oil demand may double as the developing world buys more ICE cars and builds Western-style consumer societies, and peak oil not hit until 2050 based on known oil resources with the application of today\u2019s technology.\nExtremely knowledgeable professionals cannot agree on the basic mechanisms or timing of peak oil. This is not a new trend. American geoscientist Marion King Hubbert predicted that global crude-oil production would peak in 2000. Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini of Saudi Aramco predicted that Peak Oil occurred in 2006. A UK Parliamentary task force concluded it had been 2013. There are hundreds of more faulty predictions that could be enumerated, but the shared fault in all these forecasts is a failure to recognize oil production as inherently political, and providing geological answers is vital but not sufficient.\nBeliefs and faith in this prophecy drive policy much more than any detached analysis. Peal oil skeptics point to revolutions in extraction leading to the production of more oil than ever before including hydraulic fracturing, Canadian oil sands, the Arctic reserves more accessible with climate change, and the giant Orinoco basin extra heavy crude reserves, the largest in the world. Proponents argue that peak oil creates scarcity, demand reducing oil dependency, and predict public unrest and economic difficulties.\nIf Peak oil is already here, and we have yet not met our decarbonization goals, then the implications for energy and the economy would be far-reaching. This new economy has essentially changed the way we operate post-pandemic with many continuing to work from home, travel less, and switch to battery-powered vehicles. Surging demand for rare earth minerals necessary to rapidly transition as oil fades may create a new set of scarce commodities and alter energy geo-economics with new strategic contentions.\nIf Peak oil is to arrive in the near future, then our current decarbonization strategies, while not ideal, may be sufficient to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement by 2050 with a temperature increase well below 2oC in comparison to pre-industrial levels. However, decarbonization strategies need to be extended to all emerging economies via increased investments, technology transfers, and knowledge-sharing from developed economies in order to reach the desired result.\nIf Peak Oil is far off, decarbonization and environmental strategies face tremendous obstacles from the oil market and political pressure from the OPEC+ cartel. Recognition that oil is abundant changes the global oil market as well as the much-needed transition to clean energy. If oil-producing, oil revenue-dependent countries will accept a \u201chigher volume, lower price\u201d strategy to capture returns from a diminishing value asset, then they will need to restructure their economies once oil supplies start declining and revenues fall.\nSkeptics unconcerned with environmental issues will often dismiss Peak Oil by pointing to past prophecies that never materialized and use them to unfairly diminish environmental problems. Contrarily, environmentalists will latch onto theories of Peak Oil hoping a greater natural force will vindicate their activism and propel them forward. This remains a fantasy. Stone age did not end because humans ran out of stones.\nDebates about Peak Oil do not serve the environmentally or economically conscious. Peak Oil will happen when technology makes ICE too expensive relative to the electric engine for transportation, and environmental regulation would make the polluting gasoline obsolete. As we search for the prophecy\u2019s vindication, the voters\u2019 values and the regulatory environment will continue to change, so basing environmental or energy planning on the existence or lack thereof of this magical inflection point is bad policy. The energy transition will happen when the alternatives to hydrocarbons can outcompete it.\nNo sooner, no later.\nCowritten by Wesley Alexander Hill"

      "text": "Are Republicans dishonest? Democrats immoral? Why toxic polarization threatens democracy.\nThe nation needs more Americans who understand that winning short-term political points is a losing game if we sacrifice our nation's long-term civic health.\nThis article is part of U.S. Democracy Day, a nationwide collaborative on Sept. 15, the International Day of Democracy, in which news organizations cover how democracy works and the threats it faces. To learn more, visit usdemocracyday.org.\nEarly in life, I heard the prophets of doom declare adamantly and repeatedly that the end was near for most, if not all, of us. And that our annihilation would come via a soul-chilling variety of means: nuclear Armageddon, overpopulation, global famine.\nYet here we are, living in the most prosperous and arguably the most peaceful time in human history. I know it doesn't feel that way. But, thankfully, peace and prosperity don't care about our feelings.\nSo, I've chosen, despite daily reminders of the fragility of life on this planet, to fight for optimism. After all, it costs nothing to be hopeful. And quite a lot to live in worry and fear.\nAmerican democracy faces significant threats\nStill, there is one critical area where current trends increasingly overwhelm the case for optimism: the future of American democracy.\nWhy am I concerned as we arrive at Friday's International Day of Democracy?\n\u220e Americans' trust in many major institutions (the criminal justice system, Congress, the police, public schools, organized religion, newspapers, tech companies) is at or near record lows. We tend not to listen to people or organizations we don't trust, and if we won't listen to one another, it's nearly impossible for a democratic society to function well.\nUncovering America: I walked from D.C. to NYC, and found my faith in America restored along the way\n\u220e Americans in recent years have become much more tribal in our thinking about people who don't share our political and social opinions. A Pew Research poll last year found that 72% of Republicans say Democrats are more dishonest and immoral than other Americans; more than 60% of Democrats ascribe those character flaws to Republicans. How willing are you to compromise, even for the common good, with someone you believe to be dishonest and immoral? And without compromise, a government for and by the people really doesn't work.\n\u220e The rapid decline of local news organizations has led to the emergence of \"news deserts\" in vast swaths of America. By one estimate, 70 million Americans now or will soon live in communities where no local journalism organization is informing citizens about important issues that affect their lives. Nor are journalists in those communities holding local government leaders accountable for their actions. The lack of critical information and accountability, both essential in a democracy, will over time poison local governments and further erode citizens' trust in their leaders and institutions.\n\u220e A former American president \u2212 our former president, whether you like or loathe him \u2212 has been indicted on criminal charges in four cases in the first nine months of this year. Two of those cases involve efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. This should be a time of national mourning and reflection, followed by a commitment to change our trajectory. Instead, we're trudging, set in our opinions, toward an election year that may pull our nation apart in ways we haven't seen since the chaos and despair of 1968.\nTrump wins \u2212 among nonvoters. But his delusional lies about a 'rigged' election may sink his 2024 chances\n\u220e A federal appeals court last week found that Joe Biden's White House, the FBI, the surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201clikely coerced or significantly encouraged social media platforms to moderate content\u201d in probable violation of the First Amendment. The fact that a broad array of officials targeted the might of the federal behemoth against Americans' First Amendment rights ought to alarm anyone who understands that the biggest threat to democracy is the unchecked power of government.\nHealth of democracy can't be taken for granted\nI could go on \u2212 and on. But the goal here isn't to leave you discouraged or depressed. Remember, I choose hope and optimism. The point rather is to remind us that the health of our democracy can't be taken for granted, especially now.\nIf you want to be a part of the solution and not a source of the problem, here are a few questions to ask yourself: How often do you engage in thoughtful conversations with fellow Americans who don't share your political views? How willing are you to listen to opposing opinions? Is your default setting to ridicule or dismiss those who have different life experiences and viewpoints than your own? Do you truly value American diversity, or do you think our nation would be better off if we had 50 shades of Vermont or 50 of Oklahoma?\nAre kids learning enough about civics? If we want to make history, we must understand it first.\nThe theme in those questions is more about attitude than actions. What our democracy needs most now is a change in attitude, a willingness among more Americans to extend respect, courtesy and grace to those who don't share their opinions, or even their values.\nThen we need more Americans who will risk investing time and energy into building bridges across political, social, religious, ethnic, racial and economic divides. And more Americans who understand that winning short-term political points is a losing game if we sacrifice our nation's long-term civic health.\nAre we doomed as a democracy? I choose to say no. But it will take years of hard work to repair the damage we are now inflicting on our nation and ourselves.\nTim Swarens is USA TODAY's deputy Opinion editor."

      "text": "People have worried that computers will take their jobs for basically as long as they\u2019ve been around, but those fears have felt more realistic than ever over the past year as artificial intelligence has begun to overhaul the way people work.\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei amplified those concerns in May when he warned AI could spike unemployment, particularly among white-collar jobs, to 20% over the next one to five years. Certain companies are already enlisting AI to do some of the work previously done by people; Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce are increasingly using AI to code among other tasks. And CEOs of companies ranging from Amazon to JPMorgan have warned their human workforces will shrink because of AI.\nHowever, some of those predictions deserve a healthy dose of skepticism. \u201cAI is so good, it\u2019s going to put humans out of jobs\u201d is a strong marketing message for companies selling the technology, and a potentially convenient excuse for an executive already mulling a workforce downsize.\nThe answer to whether AI really spells trouble for human workers isn\u2019t so black and white. That\u2019s according to more than half a dozen tech industry insiders CNN spoke with over the past month, who are mixed on just how much and how fast AI will upend the job market.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang, for example, told CNN AI will kill jobs only if \u201cthe world runs out of ideas.\u201d And Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told CNN that an AI \u201cjobpocalypse\u201d is among his minor concerns when it comes to the technology\u2019s impact.\nNonetheless, tech companies themselves have cut hundreds, in some cases thousands, of roles this year as they implement AI to take on a growing share of software development and other tasks.\nThere does seem to be broad consensus that the nature of work, including how it\u2019s done and which tasks humans do, is going to change, and perhaps more rapidly than with any previous technological transformation the world has seen before.\nMore than half of Americans say they\u2019re worried about AI\u2019s impact on the workplace, and a third believe AI will lead to fewer job opportunities for them over time, according to a Pew Research Center survey published in February. But the troubling AI failures that seem to make headlines every few weeks \u2014 from Elon Musk\u2019s Grok chatbot spouting antisemitic tropes after what the company called a faulty update to newspapers running AI-generated summer reading lists containing made up books \u2014 can make it hard to believe a wide-scale reliance on a robot workforce is just around the corner.\n\u201cI think that there will be some displacement. I think there\u2019ll be new job categories that emerge,\u201d said Gaurab Bansal, executive director of the nonprofit startup consultancy Responsible Innovation Labs. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at a complex reshaping, rather than a straightforward elimination.\u201d\nAnd we\u2019re just at the start.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a decade-ish, maybe more, period of uncertainty,\u201d Bansal said.\n\u2018A thinking, reasoning system\u2019\nSmall circles in Silicon Valley have for years been discussing how AI will upend the labor market \u2014 along with proposals for mitigating that impact, such as universal basic income, an approach that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has backed.\nBut the conversation has burst onto the public scene in recent months as tech giants introduce \u201cagentic AI\u201d tools.\nUnlike chatbots, where in each interaction users put in one question and get back one relatively simple response, agentic AI systems can handle more complex, multi-step tasks without step-by-step prodding. Think: coding a website based on a user\u2019s idea of what it should look like or do, or researching a topic and compiling it into a presentation.\nOpenAI last week launched an agent mode for ChatGPT that can accomplish tasks on behalf of users, while Anthropic in May introduced a model it claims can work independently for almost an entire workday.\n\u201cNow, you can give (the AI system) a goal, and it\u2019ll automatically break that down into a sequence of steps that it needs to perform the goal,\u201d Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at Amazon Web Services told CNN. \u201cYou suddenly have a reasoning, thinking system that can use various tools, so now the possibilities are really up,\u201d in terms of how they can be used in the workplace.\nAmazon, for example, used an AI developer agent to upgrade 30,000 software applications across the company last year. The project would have taken an estimated 4,500 software developers a year to complete, but the AI completed the task in just six months, according to the company. The switch saved Amazon around $250 million in capital expenditures, Sivasubramanian said.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella also said earlier this year that 20% to 30% of the company\u2019s code was being generated by AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said around half of the company\u2019s code development would be done by AI by next year. And Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told Bloomberg the company uses AI for about 30% to 50% of the company\u2019s work.\nUnlike earlier technology transformations, like the automation that\u2019s taken place in industrial settings, AI is relatively easy to adopt to improve or take over human tasks.\n\u201cAI workers are just software, and so you don\u2019t need to buy expensive physical machinery,\u201d said Steven Adler, a former OpenAI researcher. \u201cThe AI workers can also be upgraded easily when there\u2019s a stronger version. Particularly for companies used to getting software from the cloud \u2026 there\u2019s less friction to (deploying) a \u2018virtual coworker\u2019 product than ever before.\u201d\nSome jobs taken, some jobs augmented\nWhile certain categories of work, including coding and data analytics, are ripe for more significant disruption, many experts argue other roles will undergo changes rather than being eliminated altogether. Most workers, they say, will use AI to automate repetitive tasks, leaving them more time to work on creative or relational aspects of their job.\nA doctor, for example, might have an AI assistant take notes during a patient\u2019s visit and fill out their chart autonomously, giving that doctor more time for face-to-face discussions with the patient.\n\u201cMost tasks for most jobs can\u2019t be automated,\u201d Meta\u2019s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun said in a LinkedIn post last month.\nPut another way, AI is \u201cgood, but not perfect, for a subset\u201d of tasks that human workers currently do, but it can\u2019t replace most people outright, said Yacine Jernite, machine learning and society lead at open-source AI firm Hugging Face.\nCompanies and governments are investing in training workers for the AI era, including an AI training academy for teachers that a group of tech giants is partnering with teachers\u2019 unions to build in New York City. The White House last month launched a pledge for companies committed to investing in AI training and education for America\u2019s youth, which has been signed by 68 firms.\nDennis Woodside, CEO of the IT and customer service management software company Freshworks, said his firm is shifting workers that once reactively responded to customer support requests \u2014 a job more easily done by AI \u2014 to more hands-on work with clients.\nSome in the industry believe that AI will make some jobs obsolete, but it will also create new categories of work we can\u2019t currently imagine.\n\u201cWe saw that in the Internet era, where trillions of dollars of economic value were created each year and some of the biggest, most valuable, most successful companies that were started back then are prominent today in the economy,\u201d said Dan Priest, chief AI officer at professional services firm PwC. \u201cNet-net there should be a positive benefit to jobs growth, it\u2019s just going to be different jobs.\u201d\nStill, Jernite said he worries leaders in Corporate America might feel pressured to start making changes simply because they\u2019ve heard that AI could replace jobs.\n\u201cAnd people follow that direction, they fire people, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what the technology can or cannot do, but how it\u2019s perceived,\u201d Jernite said. \u201cThen they rehire those people when they figure out that\u2019s not how you leverage this really wonderful technology in a way that\u2019s responsible and sustainable.\u201d\nThe transition could be uncomfortable. Adler, the former OpenAI researcher, said he expects many white-collar workers will start to see lower wages as AI augments their jobs.\n\u201cAI will make an individual worker more productive and will help more people to be capable of doing a given job,\u201d Adler said. \u201cThe net effect is an oversupply of labor, which pushes wages down unless there\u2019s a big surge in labor demand.\u201d\nUltimately, Bansal said he believes policymakers must create a new economic framework for the AI era to ensure it\u2019s not just powerful tech companies benefiting at the expense of regular workers with fewer opportunities and more pressure to be productive. And, ideally, they need to move a lot faster than they did in addressing challenges posed by earlier waves of technology.\n\u201cWe need a new social contract for this era,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bargain we have between workers and sort of the economy is born of a different technological era.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Lisa Eadicicco contributed to this report."

      "text": "Programming Note: Watch The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper: What Whales Tell Us tonight at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\nAbout 15 billion miles from where you sit, two 12-inch golden records are hurtling through outer space with multilingual greetings to the universe from 55 humans and one humpback whale.\nWith a playlist curated by astronomer Carl Sagan and inspired by the way humpbacks use low frequencies to send messages across entire oceans, they were launched on NASA\u2019s two Voyager probes in 1977.\n\u201cAs much as the sounds of any baleen whale, it is a love song cast upon the vastness of the deep.\u201d Sagan wrote of the golden records.\nAnd, since 95% of the planet\u2019s biggest species had been harpooned to oblivion at the time, it could\u2019ve easily been the kind of love song that ends in tears.\nBut almost a half-century later, the comeback of the humpback is arguably the greatest success story in the history of conservation. While artificial intelligence could one day help us understand the lyrics of those songs in space, new science is putting a dollar value on the life of a whale \u2014 and finding they provide so much more than blubber and song.\n\u201cThey\u2019re literally seeding the upper parts of the ocean with the opportunity for plant life to grow,\u201d veteran marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender explained while bobbing on a Zodiac raft off the Antarctic Peninsula. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what feeds the food for whales, birds, seals \u2014 everything. They\u2019re basically farmers recycling nutrients and there\u2019s more food available to them the more they\u2019re around.\u201d\nCNN followed an international team of whale experts throughout 2023, from Friedlaender\u2019s lab at the University of California at Santa Cruz to humpback breeding grounds off the Pacific coast of Colombia, and their feeding grounds at the bottom of the world. While Friedlaender has been collecting whale data for more than 25 years, his work found new relevance after a team of economists from the International Monetary Fund estimated a single baleen whale provides about $2 million worth of Earth services, both in life and death.\nWhen baleen whales gulp vital nutrients like iron and nitrogen from the depths of the sea and defecate at the surface, they serve as the ocean\u2019s biggest fertilizer pumps \u2014 feeding the tiny phytoplankton which produces half the world\u2019s oxygen and captures as much planet-warming CO2 as four Amazon rainforests while holding up the bottom of the food chain.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the gold,\u201d smiled Chris Johnson, the global lead of whale and dolphin conservation at the World Wildlife Fund, as he held up a whale stool sample jarred from the chilly Antarctic water.\n\u201cWe have the poo. Repeat, we have humpback poo,\u201d Eva Prendergast, the British polar scientist at the helm, radioed back to the Ocean Endeavor, the cruise ship serving as base.\nThe team interacted with dozens of whales over the course of four days in Antarctica. They used specialized camera drones to measure body size and suction-cupped tags slapped onto the animals\u2019 backs with a long pole to record the way they move while capturing whale\u2019s-eye-view video.\nBut the most useful tools were MacGyvered into existence back at the lab in Santa Cruz. For over a decade, Friedlaender\u2019s team has been using crossbows with hollow-tipped darts to collect biopsy samples. It feels like \u201ca mosquito bite\u201d to the whales, Johnson said, but what they can test for is priceless: from stress hormones to toxins to \u2014 most importantly \u2014 pregnancy rates.\n\u201cWhat else tells you how a population is growing or shrinking?\u201d Friedlaender said after darting a humpback with a 20-yard shot and securing the tip in a sterile bag. \u201cWe can now tell if that whale is pregnant or not.\u201d\nHe has over 2,500 samples from the same region back in a fridge at UC Santa Cruz, a data set that allows him to compare fertility rates with year-by-year changes in the environment. And as global warming melts sea ice at staggering rates, the habitat for krill is shrinking and humpback pregnancies are dropping.\n\u201cIn the first year of life, juvenile krill spend the winter under the sea ice and feed on the microbial and algal communities,\u201d Friedlaender explained. \u201cWe have a very good understanding that when you have a poor sea ice year, the following year you\u2019re going to have lower reproductive rates. In good ice years, the reproductive rates are very high.\u201d\nSince the last two years have been the lowest levels of sea ice on record around Antarctica, the correlation is worrying, and the trend is only expected to accelerate as the planet warms.\n21st century threats\nBut the climate crisis is just one tragic setback in the humpback\u2019s comeback. While on the longest migration routes of any animal, whales must dodge cargo ships on crowded coastlines, \u201cghost\u201d fishing gear cut loose at sea and floating clouds of plastic pollution.\nAnd because of a global market for omega-3 krill oil supplements and nutraceutical feed for pets and fish farms, whales now compete with humans for their main source of food.\nIndustrial krill fishing fleets are taking to the Southern Ocean in growing numbers and have been recorded dragging their nets into areas full of feeding whales. After years of challenging whalers, the activist group Sea Shepherd will spend this season tracking krill fishers.\nThe fishery operation \u201cputs additional pressure on krill and krill predators that, along with growing bycatch of non-target species like the humpback and a lack of transparency across the industry, suggest that the current management framework is outdated and needs to change now,\u201d the WWF\u2019s Johnson told CNN.\nEarly in a career devoted to marine mammals, Johnson spent five years sailing on the research vessel of Roger and Katy Payne, the married scientists who blew humanity\u2019s minds by releasing Songs of the Humpback Whale in 1970.\nWhile people were familiar with the echolocating clicks of dolphins and orcas, the first baleen whale noises were recorded by Navy engineer Frank Watlington by accident in the 1950s, and after the Paynes worked with fellow cetologist Scott McVay to record more humpback songs around Bermuda, they were played during marine mammal protection hearings in Congress and the United Nations. Ten million copies were inserted into National Geographic magazine in 1979 \u2014 the largest single pressing in history \u2014 and a global movement to Save The Whales grew big enough to \u2026 save the whales.\nBy 1986, the International Whaling Commission had instituted a global ban on all commercial whaling. While Japan, Norway and Iceland have continued regardless, years of lawsuits and international pressure forced Japan to lower its annual quota of Minke whales from 1,000 to 333, and the two boats of Kristj\u00e1n Loftsson, Iceland\u2019s last whaler, harpooned two dozen fin whales in 2023.\nBut while the commercial harpoon is critically endangered, other threats remain \u2014 especially to whales that aren\u2019t as supremely adaptable as the humpback.\nScientists believe there are only about 360 North Atlantic right whales left on Earth \u2014 a species named by whalers who pointed out the \u201cright ones\u201d to hunt. Entanglements with fishing and lobster gear are the main hazard for the species migrating from the Arctic down the Atlantic coast. But concern over the North Atlantic right whale, and a number of other species, found dead on American beaches has galvanized an unusual coalition of environmentalists, fishermen and Republican beach town mayors hoping to stop the development of offshore wind farms.\nOn a campaign stop in South Carolina, former President Donald Trump mocked a call for ship speed limits during whale migration season while blaming the nascent wind industry for the harm. \u201cWindmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before,\u201d Trump said, with no evidence to support the claim.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a wind turbine can kill a whale,\u201d Friedlaender told CNN. \u201cOnce you have a structure in the ocean, the animal is not going to just run into it. I think the temporary issue comes in setting up a wind farm when you have a lot of vessel traffic that may co-occur with when whales are there and then the pile driving produces a lot of acoustic pollution, but that\u2019s also going to be relatively temporary. Once those are set up, that disturbance goes away.\u201d\nWhile pursuing its goal of generating 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030, the Biden administration recently finalized plans to protect whales by limiting leases that could impact key whale habitat, monitoring noise thresholds and helping develop whale-safe fishing gear, like innovative lobster pots which are brought to the surface with remote-controlled air bags instead of ropes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive sign that the Biden administration is doing this in a collaborative approach involving science, communities, industry and government agencies,\u201d Johnson said, and described how \u201cbubble curtains\u201d around turbine installations can contain acoustic pollution.\nA whale\u2019s song\nAdvances in artificial intelligence are beginning to help experts like Johnson and Friedlaender spot patterns of behavior previously unseen, while others hope to use AI to eventually understand the \u201clyrics\u201d in humpback song.\nIn December, a Templeton Foundation-funded team from the University of California at Davis and the Whale SETI Institute had a 20-minute \u201cconversation\u201d with a humpback in Alaska.\nWhen they played a whale\u2019s \u201cthrruup\u201d call recorded in the same spot the day before, a female humpback known as Twain responded 36 times, matching the intervals and waiting for responses from the boat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible we were either playing back her own call or one of the calls from the individuals that were in that group,\u201d Brenda McCowan, an animal behavior specialist at UC Davis told CNN. \u201cThese are a very different class of signals that are called social sounds, kind of a chatty, almost conversational,\u201d whale biologist Fred Sharpe added. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t have evidence to call it language, but it does have language-like qualities in it, that they\u2019re discrete units.\u201d\nThe Alaska team\u2019s federal permit only allowed it to engage with Twain for 20 minutes, and when they stopped the playback, \u201cshe basically called three times as she was moving away and then stopped,\u201d McCowan said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018where\u2019d you go, my new friends? Where\u2019d you go?\u2019\u201d Sharpe speculated.\nWhile female humpbacks communicate in \u201cthrruups\u201d and \u201cbloops,\u201d only males sing in the haunting tones that travel so well through the depths, and there is debate over whether they are more like singers in a seductive boy band or rivals in a rap battle.\nCarl Sagan was among the generation who believed they are mating calls like those of birds.\n\u201cBut then that hypothesis has very little evidence behind it,\u201d researcher Natalia Botero-Acosta told CNN while taking crossbow biopsies off the Pacific coast of Columbia. \u201cSo, there\u2019s this whole different set of hypotheses, that it is a mechanism for males to interact with each other and maybe arrange those competitive groups. Or that it can promote ovulation for females.\u201d\n\u201cI work with a couple of these projects that are trying to use AI to understand the context and the meaning to animal communication, but I don\u2019t have a need to talk to a whale,\u201d Friedlaender said when asked about the possibilities. \u201cA whale shouldn\u2019t have to tell us \u2018Here\u2019s all the things you\u2019re doing to screw us.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIf I could talk to a whale, I\u2019d say \u2018Sorry,\u2019\u201d Friedlaender added.\nWhile in Antarctica, he was giddy with the news that the first-ever Global Oceans Treaty had passed in the United Nations, creating a framework to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030, including key whale migration corridors. But almost a year later, only one country has ratified it.\n\u201cWe are seeing countries start to ratify it, but it\u2019s urgent we move fast,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAs soon as 60 countries ratify it, it enters into force. Last week Palau was the first, with Chile and the Maldives soon to do so. We\u2019re hopeful others will ratify soon.\u201d\nAt times, such diplomacy can feel as whimsical as launching golden records of whale song out of the galaxy.\n\u201cMany, if not most of our messages will be indecipherable,\u201d Carl Sagan wrote of the Voyager message. \u201cBut it is important to try.\u201d\nPeople saved the whales once. By doing it again, the experts say, humankind will enjoy the added benefit of saving itself."

      "text": "Thirty years of trade growth and poverty reduction\nBy Barbara D\u2019Andrea, Christophe Degain, Florian Eberth, Stela Rub\u00ednov\u00e1, Monia Snoussi-Mimouni and Ankai Xu\nSince the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization on 15 April 1994, global trade has surged, reaching over US$ 30.4 trillion in 2023, a fivefold increase since 1995. At the same time, tariffs have declined markedly under the WTO, helping to reduce trade costs. This growth in trade has coincided with a significant decrease in poverty worldwide, indicating the impact of trade on supporting economic development and improving people's lives.\nGoods and services trade have grown substantially\nWhen the WTO was launched 30 years ago, the aim was to create a new global order, based on openness, inclusivity and cooperation. Established as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which mainly dealt with trade in goods, the WTO also covers trade in services and intellectual property, with the overall objective of helping its members use trade as a means to raise living standards, create jobs and improve people's lives.\nThe 30 years since the WTO's creation have ushered in a new era of trade and economic growth. Between 1995 and 2023, total world trade \u2014 goods and commercial services \u2014 saw strong growth, averaging 5.8 per cent per year. This translates into an almost fivefold increase in world trade (see Figure 1).\nNotably, trade in commercial services outpaced goods trade, with an average annual increase of 6.8 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent for goods.\nThe growth of world trade outpaced that of global gross domestic product (GDP), which increased by an average of 4.4 per cent per year over the same period. The global trade-to-GDP ratio showed a significant upward trajectory, rising from 20 per cent in 1995 to 31 per cent in 2022, before falling back to 29 per cent in 2023, as goods trade declined in value terms on a balance-of-payments basis (see Figure 2).\nThis indicates the growing interconnectedness of economies through trade, despite temporary declines during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nShare of services in trade \u2014 particularly digitally delivered services \u2014 is growing\nThe past three decades also witnessed a growing share of services in global trade.\nThus, the share of commercial services in world trade increased from 19 per cent in 1995 to 25 per cent in 2023 (see Figure 3). However, it is important to note that these figures do not account for services trade under mode 3 of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, which involves local sales by the established affiliates of foreign services companies.\nConsequently, these figures substantially underestimate the true extent of services activity in global trade. According to the WTO's latest estimates, recently presented in the Global Trade Outlook and Statistics, with the inclusion of mode 3 services trade, the services share of global trade in 2022 was close to 42 per cent.\nWTO estimates also show that digitally delivered services have experienced a fourfold increase in value since 2005, with an average annual growth rate of 8.2 per cent over the period 2005-23. This growth has outpaced that of goods (4.8 per cent) and of other services exports (4.6 per cent) (see Figure 4).\nGlobal exports of digitally delivered services soared to US$ 4.25 trillion in 2023, up 9.0 per cent year-on-year. Digital delivery includes services traded across borders via computer networks (through the internet, mobile apps, emails, voice and video calls), and, increasingly, through digital intermediation platforms (such as those used for online gaming, music and video streaming, and remote learning).\nDigitally delivered services accounted for over 54 per cent of total services exports, and for 13.8 per cent of total combined exports of goods andservices in 2023 (compared to 8 per cent in 2005).\nFor further insights on services trade, visit the Global Services Trade Data Hub.\nShare of trade between developing economies has significantly increased\nOver the past three decades, the rapid economic growth facilitated by trade in developing and emerging economies has significantly transformed trade patterns, with particular growth in global trade between developing economies.\nTrade between developing economies expanded at a rate of 9.7 per cent per year, surging from less than a tenth of global trade in 1995 to nearly 25 per cent by 2022, reaching a total value of US$ 6.1 trillion.\nIn contrast, while trade between developed economies accounted for over half of global trade in 1995, by 2022 this proportion had declined to 39 per cent, confirming a relative shift in trade flows towards developing and emerging economies (see Figure 5).\nGlobal value chains (GVCs) have shown resilience\nThe GVC participation rate serves as an indicator of the level of trade occurring within supply chains. Despite drops during the 2008-09 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, GVC participation has maintained steady growth, demonstrating that global supply chains are resilient.\nBetween 1995 and 2022, GVC participation increased at a steady pace, with the forward GVC participation rate (covering exports to partners responsible for downstream production stages) increasing from 15.7 per cent to 20.4 per cent, and the backward GVC participation rate (covering imports for the production of goods and services for export) rising from 19.5 per cent to 28.3 per cent.\nIn 2022, the total GVC participation rate (comprising both forward and backward participation) reached 48.7 per cent, marking the highest level since 1995 (see Figure 6).\nTariffs and trade costs have declined\nThere has been a clear downward trend in tariffs since the WTO was established in 1995 (see Figure 7).\nThe simple average tariff applied by WTO members on a most-favoured nation (MFN) basis \u2014 whereby WTO members extend the same trade treatment, including tariff rates and market access, to all other WTO members \u2014 has declined from 13.1 per cent to 8.8 per cent.\nA similar trend emerges for tariffs applied on a trade-weighted basis, with the average MFN tariff dropping from 7.1 per cent to 3.8 per cent.\nBetween 1996 and 2022, the trade-weighted average of applied tariffs \u2014 based on the assumption of full utilization of preferential tariffs \u2014 dropped from 6.9 per cent to 2.0 per cent.\nBetween 1995 and 2020, international trade costs \u2014 including all physical and regulatory trade barriers \u2014 decreased by approximately 6 to 10 per cent across various sectors globally (see Figure 8). This reduction in trade impediments contributed to a notable increase in global trade, estimated at around 30 to 45 per cent. Most of the decline in trade costs occurred from 1995 to 2008.\nIncreased trade has coincided with a sharp reduction in global poverty\nBetween 1995 and 2022, low- and middle-income economies increased their share in global exports from 17 to 32 per cent. During that time, there was a notable decline in the proportion of these economies\u2019 populations subsisting on less than US$ 2.15 per day. This figure dropped markedly from 40 per cent in 1995 to 10 per cent in 2022, indicating the positive impact of trade on poverty alleviation and economic development within these regions (see Figure 9)."

      "text": "Many millennials are currently grasping in frustration at long-held American Dreams like homeownership, a steady job and an affordable cost of living. However, over the next twenty years, Millennials are poised to inherit some $90 trillion of assets and become the richest generation in history \u2013 but only the ones who already come from affluent families, potentially deepening wealth inequality further.\nBetween now and 2044 in the US, the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers are expected to hand over the reins of their significant wealth to Millennials, according to The Wealth Report, a periodic report from global property consultant Knight Frank.\nBut whether you\u2019re a Millennial on the receiving end of that wealth transfer is largely a lottery of birth.\nUltimately, this wealth shift is a result of inheritance from prior generations, largely involving property but also other assets. It will bring \u201cseismic\u201d changes to how wealth is put to use, said Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, in a statement.\nThe research also showed that affluent young people are less likely to see property or real estate as a way to build wealth in the future.\n\u201cThe low interest rate environment and impressive growth in house prices over the past 15 years is unlikely to be repeated in the next 15,\u201d Mike Pickett, director of Cazenove Capital, said in the report. There\u2019s evidence, he said, that the following generation, Gen Z, may be more comfortable renting a home, leasing a vehicle and living a subscription lifestyle than prior generations.\nHe added that not only will wealth be transferred to these younger people, but there are a variety of new ways to build wealth.\n\u201cIt goes beyond a simple shift of existing wealth,\u201d Pickett said. \u201cI think the diversity of opportunity to create wealth has also grown \u2014 for example, there are YouTubers worth tens of millions. First-generation wealth creation is on the rise, as is the array of entrepreneurial routes to create it.\u201d\nWealth revival in 2023\nThe report also revealed that more people became wealthier last year, with a growth in super-wealthy individuals that more than reversed a drop the year before.\nThe number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals \u2014 defined as those with a net worth of $30 million or more \u2014 was up 4.3% in 2023 from the year before, to 626,619 people globally, according to the report.\nNorth America saw its share of the ultra-wealthy grow the most of any region, rising 7.2% from last year. It was followed by the Middle East, with a 6.2% increase in the super-wealthy; and Africa, which increased by 3.8%. Latin America is the only region to see its population of ultra-wealthy individuals decline, dropping 3.6% from a year ago.\n\u201cThe improving interest rate outlook, the robust performance of the US economy and a sharp uptick in equity markets helped wealth creation globally,\u201d said Bailey.\nThis group of uber-wealthy individuals finds property an attractive investment, the report found. About 19% of this group plans to invest in commercial real estate this year, while 22% plans to buy residential property.\nLooking ahead, the number of supremely wealth people is expected to increase by 28% over the next five years, according to the report. While the numbers of the super wealthy are expected to grow, that is a much slower pace than the 44% increase in the five-year period ending in 2023.\nMore growth in ultra-high-net-worth individuals is expected in Asia, including India, China, Malaysia and Indonesia, the report said."

Now we fear something too small to see\n- Share via\nAs a kid, growing up in the 1960s, I feared death from above: the A-bomb\u2019s immense, blinding flash, its mushroom cloud. Nights during the Cuban missile crisis, I sat in bed, ear pressed to the window as I tried to gauge the height of planes overhead because I imagined bombers would fly low. For years, I checked every home I rented for its safest, least-windowed room, just in case. And during a nap when I was 20, I had a nuclear nightmare so vivid I remember it to this day.\nI never thought that in my life\u2019s Act III, the terror would be death from something too small to see \u2014 a microscopic virus, carried on someone\u2019s random sneeze. But it feels appropriate somehow, a reminder of something my generation once knew, then forgot: vulnerability.\nIt\u2019s become hip to hate boomers \u2014 our arrogant refusal to retire and make way, our failure to change the world, and now our rejection of our status as the \u201cat-risk elderly.\u201d\nI cop to the arrogance. We were told from day one how important we were. Around us, science was making real what had been science fiction just a decade before \u2014 jet planes, organ transplants, actual rocket ships. \u201cRemember this day!\u201d teachers were always saying. \u201cYou will be able to say I was there when the first American reached space...orbited Earth...walked on the moon.\u201d Later, when we rebelled, we weren\u2019t brats but a rag-tag youth army.\nI acknowledge our many political failures, though honestly, most people I know did struggle to make change, and are still trying. And we do have an insane sense of invincibility to everything, including old age (weight training! Botox! Viagra! Bionic knees!).\nBut in the time of the coronavirus, our true sin seems to me that we let ourselves believe our specialness kept us immune from the world. When the bombs didn\u2019t drop after all, when those terrifying geopolitical forces over which we had no control receded, we mistook our lives of relative privilege for a guarantee that we\u2019d always be OK. Yes, we lost some of our generation to Vietnam, and later to AIDS \u2014 losses compounded by governmental bungling. But to us, the memories of walking the streets jobless and destitute, and of world war, which haunted our parents\u2019 dreams, were ancient, irrelevant history.\nWe were safely vaccinated against once-fatal diseases, saw the civil rights movement suggest that the arc of history really was bending toward justice, went to college in droves and left mostly debt-free \u2014 my four years at a University of California campus combined cost about $6,800 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 and pretty easily found jobs that paid the rent.\nNobody burned our homes, the attack helicopters didn\u2019t hover overhead, the freeways hummed, new movies opened, beaches beckoned and store shelves stayed full of goodies. Sure, 9/11 was a reminder that it can happen here but for those living thousands of miles away without a personal connection to New York City, the dreadful, iconic images were only that. We were filled with a complacency so pervasive we stopped recognizing it.\nMy own unacknowledged belief that I was immune from suffering was what most shamed me when I got to know people who\u2019d grown up in other places, their lives irretrievably shaped by war, repression, famine. In 1970 when I was in my bedroom burning incense to irritate my parents, one of those people was being exiled from Shanghai to pick rice in the countryside. In the mid-1980s, while I fretted about losing a rent-controlled house in Santa Monica, another was searching the San Salvador morgues for the body of her disappeared brother. They knew quite well that the world could step in and smash everything they loved. Who was I to imagine otherwise?\nNow, I\u2019m holed up at home, with my millennial daughter, who herself grew up with a constant sense of doom. Of course there\u2019s another market crash, she says. Of course another tsunami, hurricane, flood, mass shooting. I send \u201care you OK?\u201d texts to friends as we all watch the death toll rise and our savings shrink, just when our laid-off kids and grandkids will need financial support.\nThis new bomb was a message to boomers \u2014 and maybe to all of us. History, like biology, doesn\u2019t care who you are or what stories you tell yourself. No one, not even a golden, blessed generation, escapes its hand.\nCarol Mithers is a Los Angeles journalist and coauthor, with Leymah Gbowee, of the memoir \u201cMighty Be Our Powers: How Sisterhood, Prayer, and Sex Changed a Nation at War.\u201d"

      "text": "Is capitalism to blame for hunger and poverty?\nBefore capitalism, most of the global population were living in extreme poverty. From 90 percent in 1820, the rate has now fallen to 10 percent.\nMost remarkably, since the end of communism in China and other countries in recent decades, poverty has declined faster than in any previous period in human history.\nMany people who believe that capitalism is to blame for hunger and poverty have an entirely unrealistic notion of life in pre-capitalist societies. Johan Norberg, the author of the book Progress, was himself an anti-capitalist in his youth. He admits, however, that he had never really given much thought to how people might have lived before the Industrial Revolution. He had basically imagined this entire epoch of human history similar to a trip to the countryside.\nFernand Braudel, the famous French historian wrote a definitive work on the social history of the 15th to 18th centuries. People\u2019s diets, he revealed, largely consisted of porridge, soup and bread made from low-quality flour, which was baked in batches every couple of months and was often moldy and so hard that it could only be cut with an axe. Most people, even in cities, had to get by on 2,000 calories a day, with carbohydrates making up well over 60 percent of the total. Food was often nothing more than a lifetime of eating bread and bread again, or mush and porridge. People back then were lean and small in stature \u2013 throughout history, the human body has adapted to inadequate caloric intake.\nSome people rave about the harmonious pre-capitalist world, in which everything was so \u201cdecelerated.\u201d This slowness, however, was mostly a result of physical weakness due to permanent malnutrition. It is estimated that 200 years ago about 20 percent of the inhabitants of England and France were not able to work at all. At most, they were only strong enough to walk slowly for a few hours each day, which condemned them to begging for their entire lives. The \u201cpossessions\u201d most people owned were limited to no more than a few items, as seen in contemporary pictures: a few stools, a bench and a barrel that served as a table. Even these descriptions only refer to Western Europe, which was home to the small number of countries where people were best off at the time.\nI have described this in such detail here so that you can more fully understand what it means when people say that 90 percent of the world\u2019s population were living in extreme poverty before the emergence of capitalism. In other parts of the world, living standards were far worse than they were in Western Europe. The British economist Angus Maddison, who specialises in analysing historical economic data, used a series of complex calculations to estimate the historic gross domestic product per capita for a range of countries around the world. In 1820, this amounted to 1,202 international dollars (a unit of measurement based on the year 1990) in Western Europe. The figure is similar in other Western countries, such as North America, Australia and New Zealand. In the rest of the world, however, GDP per capita at the same time was only 580 international dollars, or about half as much.\nThe impact of capitalism is evident from a longer historical comparison. In the first year of our common era, GDP per capita in Western Europe was 576 international dollars, compared to 467 international dollars for the world as a whole. That means that in Europe, GDP per capita doubled in the pre-capitalist period, between year 1 and the year 1820. In the much shorter period from 1820 to 2003, GDP per capita in Western Europe then rose from 1,202 to 19,912 international dollars and in the other capitalist countries of the West it climbed as high as 23,710 international dollars.\nBut the same progress was not replicated everywhere. In Asia, for example, in the 153 years from 1820 to 1973 GDP per capita only increased from 691 to 1,718 international dollars. And then, in just 30 years, from 1973 to 2003, it rose from 1,718 to 4,344 international dollars.\nSo what happened? These incredible developments in Asia are mainly due to the fact that China progressively introduced free-market principles after Mao Zedong\u2019s death in 1976. As late as 1981, as many as 88 percent of the Chinese population were still living in extreme poverty; today it is less than one percent. Never in world history have so many hundreds of millions of people been lifted out of abject poverty and into the middle class in such a short time.\nCapitalism has done more to overcome hunger and poverty than any other system in world history. The most devastating man-made famines over the past 100 years all occurred under socialism \u2013 in the 1930s alone, according to a range of estimates, between five and nine million people died in the Soviet Union from famines caused by the socialist collectivisation of agriculture.\nThe end of communism in China and the Soviet Union was a major factor in the 42 percent reduction of hunger between 1990 and 2017.\nIn North Korea, however, one of the world\u2019s few remaining socialist states, several hundred thousand people died in famines from 1994 to 1998.\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom reveals that the world\u2019s most capitalist countries have an average GDP per capita of $71,576. That compares to $47,706 in the \u201cmostly free\u201d countries. At the other end of the scale are the \u201cmostly unfree\u201d and \u201crepressed\u201d countries, where the GDP per capita is only $6,834 and $7,163, respectively.\nRainer Zitelmann is the author of The Power of Capitalism."

      "text": "Latest Federal Data Show That Young People Are More Likely Than Older Adults to Be Experiencing Symptoms of Anxiety or Depression\nAmericans\u2019 Mental Health Continues to Be A Concern as Many People Try to Move Beyond the Pandemic\nYoung adults in the United States continue to be more likely than their older counterparts to be experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression, according to the latest federal data analyzed by KFF researchers.\nThe analysis of the Census Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey finds that half (50%) of adults ages 18-24 reported anxiety and depression symptoms in 2023, compared to about a third of adults overall. The data also show that young adults are more likely than adults of any other age group to experience mental health symptoms.\nMany young adults have come of age in an era of pandemic-related school closures, remote work and job and income loss, all of which may contribute to poor mental health. Additionally, young adults in college settings may encounter increased difficulty accessing treatment.\nBut young adults are not alone in experiencing heightened mental health symptoms. The mental health and substance use concerns that were present during the COVID-19 crisis continue to affect many Americans, even as many people try to move beyond the pandemic, Census data show.\nNearly 4 in 10 (39.3%) adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in February 2021, compared to 32.3 percent in 2023. A KFF/CNN survey in October 2022 found that 90 percent of the public believes there is a mental health crisis in the U.S..\nPoor mental health has also been more pronounced among adolescent females during the pandemic, with 57 percent reporting feelings of hopelessness and sadness compared to 29 percent of their male peers in 2021, the latest such data available. In the same period, 30 percent of adolescent females reported that they seriously considered attempting suicide, compared to 14 percent of adolescent males.\nAdditionally, drug overdose deaths have sharply increased during the pandemic. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, in 2021 there were over 106,600 deaths due to drug overdose in the U.S. \u2014 the highest on record. This spike in deaths has primarily been driven by substances laced with synthetic opioids, including illicitly manufactured fentanyl.\nHere again young people especially have been affected. Research suggests that while substance use among adolescents has declined, drug overdose deaths have sharply increased among this population, primarily due to fentanyl-laced substances. Among adolescents, drug overdose deaths have more than doubled from 2019 (282 deaths) to 2021 (637 deaths). Male, Black, and Hispanic youth have experienced the highest increases in deaths due to drug overdose.\nThe analysis details several changes in the delivery of mental health and substance use services that have been implemented since the onset of the pandemic, including the growth of telehealth, steps to improve access to treatment for opioid use disorders, expansion of school-based mental health care, and the rollout of the 988 national suicide prevention and crisis line.\nRelated Resources\n- KFF also recently has updated our database of Medicaid Behavioral Health Services, which includes state-specific data on mental health and substance use on more than 50 indicators.\n- We have released a companion brief that summarizes the data, which was collected in our 2022 Medicaid Behavioral Health Survey.\n- Also available are updated mental health state fact sheets profiling each state."

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe American Dream is dead. Nearly 80 percent of Americans under the age of 30 don't believe it holds true anymore, and a majority over the age of 65 agree. While it's tempting to chalk this discontent up to a lack of patriotism among young people, the reality is that Americans are feeling hopeless, cynical, and doomed for good reason: through no fault of their own, the doorway to opportunity has slammed shut in their faces.\nWith few exceptions, your birthdate now determines whether you will be part of a permanent class of debt-dependent renters who spend their lives scrambling to keep up or financially independent owners who have the leisure to cultivate passions and become influential members of local society.\nTake the most profound example: the cost of living. Given rising inflation and high interest rates, housing costs and average monthly mortgage payments are about 100 percent more than they were four years ago. Twice as much\u2014in just four years! That rate of change has effectively shuttered the market against new buyers. According to Zillow, \"the roughly $106,500 needed to comfortably afford the mortgage payment on a typical home is well above what a typical U.S. household earns each year, estimated at about $81,000.\" Priced out of the housing market, young individuals and families are forced to either join the renter class\u2014paying the national median monthly rent of more than $2,100\u2014or move back in with their parents.\nJust as economic success has always only been part of the American Dream, these economic challenges represent just a small portion of the crisis facing Americans today. Beyond the financial challenges, Americans are facing an acute crisis of meaning and belonging with profound consequences for health, prosperity, and democracy itself.\nThis crisis manifests in four key areas:\nFor the first time in American history there are more single adults (18-55 years old) with no children than there are married adults with children, and 40 percent of all births are now out-of-wedlock, compared with 18 percent in 1980. The emergence of the isolated individual as the primary social unit has radical implications for every facet of American life, specifically for politics and economics. Cut off from the support of family and civil society, we must expect the demands on government to grow and debt-related financing to increase to meet the needs of this new, socially isolated constituency.\nPost-pandemic addiction rates remain high in America. Some habits like social media, porn, video games, and regular marijuana use\u2014which recently outstripped alcohol use rates\u2014erode mental health and sociability, and others like opioids and methamphetamines prove fatal. Over 100,000 Americans now die annually from drug overdoses, about a 500 percent increase since 2000. The burden of modern American life is so heavy that deaths of despair have become the new normal.\nMeanwhile, a decline in civic literacy has contributed to a loss of cultural memory and identity. According to a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation survey, \"more than 70% of Americans fail a basic civic literacy quiz [and] just half were able to correctly name the branch of government where bills become laws.\" Our regime is premised upon the idea of self-government under law. We call ourselves citizens, not subjects, but most people lack an elementary understanding of how our government works. Without knowledge of that system and an appreciation for our past, it's impossible to have hope for a better future.\nFinally, 28 percent of Americans are religiously unaffiliated and only 21 percent attend a religious service weekly. Our nation's second president, John Adams, wrote that \"Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\" Without a shared religious foundation, the ethical basis of our laws erodes, the social support provided by churches diminishes, and the thrust of our culture becomes fundamentally materialistic and nihilistic.\nWhen faced with such significant, even existential, challenges, the rising generation is searching for answers\u2014and for mentors. They want to learn how to live well but feel powerless to act. This explains the growing popularity of lifestyle influencers like Jordan Peterson, who pack venues with thousands of young men in places like Detroit, Michigan; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Fargo, North Dakota, looking for meaning and belonging.\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the crisis of \"American carnage\" that former president Donald Trump aptly, if shockingly, described at his 2017 inaugural address is more acute now than it was seven years ago. The great task facing our political leaders today will be to address it head-on by speaking to the heart and offering a blueprint to move Americans from isolation to independence, from despair and addiction to hope and health, from shame to confidence, and from doubt and loneliness to faith and community.\nGiven the scope of the problem, November's results may depend less on lawfare campaigns against Trump or Joe Biden's mental acuity than on which candidate can address the profound pain\u2014economic and spiritual\u2014experienced by the American people and can chart a pathway towards a restored American dream.\nJohn A. Burtka IV is the president and CEO of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and editor of Gateway to Statesmanship: Selections from Xenophon to Churchill.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own."

By 2021 this had more than doubled to 71 years.\nBut where, when, how, and why has this dramatic change occurred?\nTo understand it, we can look at data on life expectancy worldwide.\nThe large reduction in child mortality has played an important role in increasing life expectancy. But life expectancy has increased at all ages. Infants, children, adults, and the elderly are all less likely to die than in the past, and death is being delayed.\nThis remarkable shift results from advances in medicine, public health, and living standards. Along with it, many predictions of the \u2018limit\u2019 of life expectancy have been broken.\nOn this page, you will find global data and research on life expectancy and related measures of longevity: the probability of death at a given age, the sex gap in life expectancy, lifespan inequality within countries, and more.\nResearch & Writing\nMore articles on life expectancy\n\u201cLife Expectancy\u201d \u2013 What does this actually mean?\nThe rise of maximum life expectancy\nWhy do women live longer than men?\nHow does the risk of death change as we age \u2013 and how has this changed over time?\nPeriod versus cohort measures: what\u2019s the difference?\nIt\u2019s not just about child mortality, life expectancy improved at all ages\nThe Spanish flu: The global impact of the largest influenza pandemic in history\nWhy is life expectancy in the US lower than in other rich countries?\nKey Charts on Life Expectancy\nSee all charts on this topicEndnotes\nAs you can see, the chart also shows that the rise has not been completely constant.

      "text": "Millennials are building wealth faster than older generations. What's their secret?\nIn financial terms, millennials are having a good decade.\nThe generation born between 1981 and 1996 has built wealth faster than either Generation X or baby boomers in the 2020s, according to several recent reports. Another batch of studies show that millennials have more wealth now than older generations held at the same age.\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing better than we did,\u201d said Christian Weller, a Gen Xer and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\nA 2024 report from the Center for American Progress found that the average wealth of under-40 Americans rose by 49% between the end of 2019 and the end of 2023, to an inflation-adjusted average net worth of $259,000. That group includes millennials and the oldest of Generation Z. Millennials, by themselves, saw their wealth double in those years.\nBy contrast, wealth declined by 7% between 2019 and 2023 for Americans ages 40 to 54, a group dominated by Generation X. Wealth rose by 4% for Americans ages 55 to 69, mostly boomers.\nA 2025 report from Empower, the financial services company, found that millennial wealth rose 13% in 2024. Gen X and boomers saw much smaller gains.\nMillennials are wealthier than Gen X, boomers at the same age\nMillennials are wealthier now than older Americans were at the same age. The median millennial had a net worth of $84,941 in 2022, according to an analysis from the personal finance site LendingTree. Adjusting for inflation, Generation X had a median net worth of $78,333 at the same age. Boomers had a median net worth of $58,101.\nMillennials and Gen-Z adults have amassed wealth across the board in the 2020s. Average housing wealth for under-40 households rose by $22,000 between the end of 2019 and the end of 2023, the Center for American Progress analysis found. Liquid assets, including bank deposits, grew by $9,000. Other financial assets, including stocks and mutual funds, rose by $31,000.\n\u201cIt\u2019s every single category that has gone up,\u201d Weller said. \u201cThat is home equity, retirement savings, equity in privately held businesses \u2013 all of that has grown faster\u201d than for older generations, he said. \u201cHomeownership has risen faster; wages have grown faster.\u201d\nMillennial wealth is a Cinderella story. Millennial finances languished for years. As recently as five years ago, millennials trailed far behind older generations in net worth. As of mid-2019, millennial wealth totaled roughly $4 trillion, according to Federal Reserve data. Gen X's wealth totaled $25 trillion, and baby boomers held $59 trillion.\nBy the third quarter of 2024, however, millennial wealth had quadrupled to $16 trillion. Gen X and boomer wealth grew much more slowly.\nMillennials had more time to recover from the Great Recession\nOne big reason why millennials are gaining wealth at a faster rate than older Americans in the 2020s is that they had much less money at the decade's start.\nTheir rising fortunes also have a lot to do with the economic cycles that have played out in their adult lifetimes, financial analysts say.\nMany millennials started their careers, or tried to, during the bleak years of the Great Recession in the late 2000s. Home values plummeted, joblessness spiked, and the S&P 500 lost more than half of its value.\nMillennials had it bad in the Great Recession, but some older generations had it worse.\nThe downturn descended when the oldest Gen-Xers and the youngest baby boomers were in their prime earning years, their 30s and 40s.\nComing out of the Great Recession, the \u201cBeatlemania\u201d boomers, born in the early 1960s, had less wealth than older generations. To this day, that cohort lags in retirement wealth, research shows.\nThe same economic malaise afflicts much of Generation X. Americans ages 45 to 54 have less wealth than older generations held at the same age, according to the 2022 federal Survey of Consumer Finances.\nBecause millennials were younger in the Great Recession years, the damage to their lifetime earnings was comparatively small.\n\u201cMillennials have had more time to recover from the hits they took in the Great Recession when they were just coming out of the gates,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. \u201cI think a lot of them learned a lot of lessons from that period that have stuck with them.\u201d\nMore millennials are going into debt\nThe millennial wealth boom is not, however, a story of unqualified financial success.\nMillennials are increasingly turning to debt consolidation, according to data from Money Management International, the debt-counseling nonprofit.\nMillennials represent 43% of new counseling clients at Money Management International, leading all other generations, the agency reports. The average millennial client now carries $30,000 in unsecured debt, including credit card debt.\nFederal Reserve data suggests that millennials, and thirtysomethings, in particular, are carrying more debt now than a few years ago, especially by comparison with other age groups.\nIn the closing months of 2019, consumers in their 40s had the most total debt, $3.6 trillion, followed by Gen-X fiftysomethings ($3.3 trillion) and millennial thirtysomethings ($3 trillion), federal data show.\nBy the close of 2024, the generations had switched places. Fortysomethings still had the most total debt, $4.7 trillion. But now, thirtysomethings ranked second, with $4 trillion in debt. Fiftysomethings had fallen to third.\nTo some extent, millennial wealth is a story of haves and have-nots. Just over half of millennials are homeowners, according to a 2024 analysis by The Motley Fool. The generation took longer to reach that threshold than older generations because of rising home prices. Many millennials missed out on a chance to amass property wealth.\n\u201cI think that older millennials, who bought into the housing market before everything got out of control, are probably driving a fair amount of this overall net worth growth,\u201d said Schulz of LendingTree.\nNearly 70% of millennial wealth is concentrated in the top 10% of the generational population, according to an analysis by Inequality.org, a nonprofit that tracks wealth disparities. Their 2024 report terms millennials the \u201cmost unequal generation\u201d in the United States.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not every millennial who\u2019s basking in wealth,\u201d Schulz said."

      "text": "It\u2019s easy to look around and conclude that everything is horrible, that the world is getting less safe and more chaotic.\nThe case for optimism\nThe world is better than ever before. And Harvard\u2019s Steven Pinker can prove it.\nSteven Pinker, a Harvard psychologist and author of Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, has been arguing for years that this is an illusion. His last book, The Better Angels of our Nature, looked at the data and showed that violence has declined steadily throughout human history, and that the present age is in fact the safest we\u2019ve ever seen.\nHis latest book, Enlightenment Now, doubles down on this argument. Pinker zooms back and examines the \u201cbig picture of human progress\u201d since the late 18th century, right around the time the Enlightenment Age kicked off. This is basically the period in which the spirit of science \u2014 reason, evidence-based thinking, and the belief that knowledge can be used to improve the human condition \u2014 exploded in the Western world.\nPinker highlights the data on education, literacy, wealth, and longevity to make the broader case that life, on the whole, is getting better. He also rebuts dystopian arguments about the dangers of technology, particularly artificial intelligence.\nI spoke with him about why he\u2019s so optimistic about the future and about why I\u2019m not.\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\nSean Illing\nI feel like you\u2019re waging a heroic campaign to make us all feel better. Do you see yourself as deliberately pushing back against a pervasive pessimism?\nSteven Pinker\nIt\u2019s not to make people feel better about the future so much as to make them appreciative of what we\u2019ve accomplished in the past, because what will happen in the future very much depends on the choices that we make now.\nSean Illing\nWhat is the Enlightenment, and what story does the data about violence, education, wealth, etc. tell us about it?\nSteven Pinker\nThe parts of the Enlightenment that I\u2019m singling out for praise are the goal of enhancing human well-being and the means of understanding the way the world works through science and reason. What we get with the Enlightenment is a shared and deliberate effort to use knowledge and sympathy to enhance human flourishing.\nI try to call attention to the fact that the Enlightenment project has succeeded wildly, and we don\u2019t fully appreciate that fact.\nHuman welfare has improved dramatically, and it\u2019s improved by almost any measure you like \u2014 longevity, health, prosperity, education, literacy, leisure time, and on and on.\nAll of these have increased, and yet you\u2019re likely to draw the opposite impression from reading headlines or watching cable news. But the objective record shows that progress has taken place, and it\u2019s really an enormous success story.\nSean Illing\nDo you blame the media for cementing this impression that everything is broken and awful?\nSteven Pinker\nI don\u2019t want to come across as a blanket critic of media because we\u2019ve seen far too much of an assault on the free press, and we obviously need the press to identify the problems facing us. But there\u2019s also a danger in neglecting progress.\nOne danger is creating the impression that there\u2019s nothing we can do to improve society, or falsely equating pessimism with moral seriousness. What we don\u2019t want to do is spread a sense of fatalism and make people think they can\u2019t make a difference and that it\u2019s better to just enjoy life while we can and not have children and not worry about the future.\nThere\u2019s also the potential of inciting radicalism by cultivating the fear that society is headed toward catastrophe and therefore the only hope is to tear down all our institutions. If we lose sight of what\u2019s working, of what we\u2019ve gained, we risk slipping into extremism.\n\u201cPopulism is not an inevitable or unstoppable force, and when you look at the demographics of support for populism, it\u2019s by no means a foregone conclusion that these movements are the wave of the future\u201d\nSean Illing\nOkay, but progress yesterday is no guarantee of progress tomorrow, and I think there\u2019s a tendency to assume that history has a clear, constant direction and that things will continue to get better. But that\u2019s clearly not true. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being Utopian, but a lot of people will read this book and assume that the Enlightenment set us on a path of inevitable progress. And that kind of thinking can also be dangerous.\nSteven Pinker\nIt\u2019s a fair point. We\u2019re susceptible to magical thinking in assuming that anything that happens is the result of some mystical or cosmic force that will continue to make it happen. And yes, it\u2019s dangerous to assume that history inexorably bends toward justice.\nBut I do think there are systemic factors that tend to push us toward progress. As we continually expand discourse and interaction, as people from diverse cultural backgrounds continue to sit down and agree about how to run their affairs, things tend to get better.\nThe spirit of the Enlightenment was about more cosmopolitanism, more solidarity, more belief in the collective power of human reason to solve problems. Ultimately, it was about more conversation and less violence. It pushed us toward aspects of human well-being that we share as a result of our common humanity.\nSean Illing\nTechnology, which is a product of the Enlightenment, has surely brought much of the wealth and prosperity you mentioned earlier. But I also think our technology has outpaced our humanity, and that we\u2019re speeding into a future we don\u2019t understand or can\u2019t control.\nSteven Pinker\nPeople have been saying that for decades, maybe centuries. I think it\u2019s easy to confuse the fact that when any technology is introduced, it takes a while for societies to come up with countermeasures that extract the benefits without the costs. Anytime you have new technologies, you have to confront a package of benefits and harms.\nWhen cars were introduced, there was a huge increase in the rate of deaths from car accidents and pedestrian fatalities. But those plummeted as safety measures were created and better roads and traffic laws and technologies were introduced.\nWe saw some a similar trajectory in the case of pollution during and after the Industrial Revolution. Initially, air and water quality were drastically diminished, sometimes catastrophically. But then legislation and technologies were introduced to deal with the harms, and we\u2019ve seen steady improvements in air and water quality across the West.\nOther than the bleak technology of weaponry, which is in a special category because it\u2019s designed to harm people, I think the other technologies can seem more frightening than they ultimately are because when they\u2019re introduced, we have to deal with both the harms and the benefits before we come up with countermeasures.\nSean Illing\nWhat worries you the most right now?\nSteven Pinker\nI\u2019d say climate change, followed very closely by nuclear war. Probably my third concern would be the rise of authoritarian populism and fascism.\nSean Illing\nWhy aren\u2019t you as worried about the robocalypse as I am?\nSteven Pinker\nThere are two fears here. One is that machines will want to take over and subjugate us, which I think comes from the fallacy of confusing intelligence with motivation. Humans seem to have greater intelligence than other animals, and because we possess the desire to dominate other animals, we mistakenly think that intelligence and the drive to dominate are the same thing.\nBut we have these desires because we\u2019re products of evolution. An artificial intelligence will not have evolved in this way, and there\u2019s no reason to assume it will share the desire to dominate or maximize its power. It could be completely benevolent.\nSean Illing\nAnd the second fear?\nSteven Pinker\nThe second is that we will design an artificially intelligent system, give it some goal, and then stand helplessly by as it seeks to implement that goal regardless of human interests.\nFor example, we give an AI system the goal of killing cancer and it decides to conscript us all into some kind of fatal experiment in pursuit of the cure. Or we turn over control of water level behind a dam to an AI program and it decides to flood a town because we forgot to tell it when you maintain the water level, make sure you don\u2019t drown people.\nI think all of this is nonsensical and based on two internally self-contradictory premises. The first is that humans would be so brilliant as to be able to design a system that was capable of curing cancer or controlling every aspect of the environment, and yet so idiotic that they would give it control over an entire society without testing how it worked.\nAnd the second is that the system would be so brilliant that it could cure cancer but also so idiotic that it would single-mindedly pursue one goal, ignoring all the other goals as it tries to achieve this one feat.\nSean Illing\nThere are a lot of computer scientists who don\u2019t share that view, but I\u2019m probably not the best person to offer the counterpoint. I do think you understate the dangerous political consequences of an arms race between nations over AI technology.\nSteven Pinker\nAre you specifically referring to weaponry? To military technology?\nSean Illing\nMilitary technology is certainly part of it, but the potential applications of a truly artificially intelligent system would extend into countless other areas. Imagine what a comparative advantage it would be for the country who gets there first. This is one of the things Elon Musk warned about last year.\nSteven Pinker\nIt depends what those applications are and what control is given over to the machine. If the AI really is an enhanced ability to solve problems, then it comes down to what kinds of problems we set for it solve. If the problem we give it involves increasing human well-being as opposed to deliberate harm, as in the case of weaponry, then I don\u2019t see much cause for concern.\nA lot of the concerns about fierce international competition have to do with safety being abandoned in the mad pursuit of AI. But I don\u2019t quite understand that. A hyper-intelligent AI system that sacrifices human safety to accomplish a goal isn\u2019t a smart system; it\u2019s a stupid system.\nSean Illing\nYou acknowledge in the book that political disorder could upend all the progress we\u2019ve made. You even call populism a \u201ccounter-enlightenment movement.\u201d Looking around at the political currents across the globe right now, how concerned are you?\nSteven Pinker\nI\u2019m concerned. I think these are potentially harmful movements. Whether they will succeed is another question. There have been a number of premature announcements of the death of democracy and the demise of cosmopolitan liberalism, but I think a lot of this confuses a push back with an inevitable triumph.\nBut populism is not an inevitable or unstoppable force, and when you look at the demographics of support for populism, it\u2019s by no means a foregone conclusion that these movements are the wave of the future, because support for them falls off precipitously with age.\nSean Illing\nWhat\u2019s the most consequential thing we can do to ensure that progress continues?\nSteven Pinker\nAdopting an evidence-based mindset, an open-minded attitude that would seek to identify what has worked in the past, what has the best chance of working in the future \u2014 and endorsing those policies, as opposed to just expressing an allegiance to political ideology or tribe."

      "text": "AARP Hearing Center\nWASHINGTON\u2014According to a new AARP survey exploring the second half of life, most older adults have an optimistic outlook on life and expect their lives to improve as they get older. Nearly 9 in 10 are at least somewhat optimistic about their future, with half being extremely or very optimistic.\nThese and other findings are explored further in a groundbreaking new book, The Second Fifty, authored by Debra Whitman, AARP\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Public Policy Officer. The Second Fifty takes readers on a search for answers at a critical time in our history: by 2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be age 65 or older, and by 2050, the U.S. is projected to have nearly 1 million centenarians.\n\u201cThe Second Fifty provides a roadmap for navigating and celebrating the second half of life, emphasizing the importance of mindset to living well as we age,\u201d said Debra Whitman. \u201cWhether you are approaching 50, well into your later years, or caring for someone who is, The Second Fifty provides practical steps, grounded in research, to help us all create a better second half of life for ourselves and our loved ones.\u201d\nThis new survey exploring the second half of life serves as an update to the original second half of life study released in June 2022, which inspired The Second Fifty.\n# # #\nAbout AARP\nAARP is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. With a nationwide presence, AARP strengthens communities and advocates for what matters most to the more than 100 million Americans 50-plus and their families: health security, financial stability and personal fulfillment.

Progress has stalled amid low growth, setbacks due to COVID-19, and increased fragility. Poverty rates in low-income countries are higher than before the pandemic.\nAround 3.5 billion people (44 percent of the global population) remain poor by a standard that is more relevant for upper middle-income countries ($6.85 per day), and the number of people living on less than this standard has barely changed since the 1990s due to population growth.\nIn 2024, Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 16 percent of the world\u2019s population, but 67 percent of the people living in extreme poverty. Two thirds of the world\u2019s population in extreme poverty live in Sub-Saharan Africa, rising to three quarters when including all fragile and conflict-affected countries. About 72 percent of the world\u2019s population in extreme poverty live in countries that are eligible to receive assistance from the International Development Association (IDA).\nBased on the current trajectory, 622 million people (7.3 percent of the global population) are projected to live in extreme poverty in 2030. This means, about 69 million people are projected escape extreme poverty between 2024 and 2030 compared to about 150 million who did so between 2013 and 2019. In addition, 3.4 billion people (nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s population) will likely live on less than $6.85 per day.\nIf growth does not accelerate and become more inclusive, it will take decades to eradicate extreme poverty and more than a century to lift people above the $6.85 per day poverty line.\nImproving labor incomes by creating more and better jobs and investing in education, infrastructure, and basic services will be important to enable people living in poverty to benefit more from and contribute to growth, and to enhance their resilience amid increasing shocks.\nToday, one in five people are at risk of an extreme weather event in their lifetime. This means they are likely to face severe setbacks in their livelihoods, significantly hindering poverty reduction efforts.\nPeople\u2019s risks to climate hazards are expected to increase unless resilience is strengthened and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decline.\nProtecting people from extreme weather events requires acting on two fronts: (i) lowering vulnerability by enhancing risk management; and (ii) preventing the escalation of future climate hazards by accelerating transformations to reduce the emissions intensiveness of growth.\nEradicating poverty and boosting shared prosperity on a livable planet requires managing trade-offs.\nTo inform decisions it is important to understand the trade-off between growing incomes and lowering GHG emissions, find ways to scale up synergistic policies that can help advance on multiple fronts or reduce trade-offs, and manage short-term transition costs to specific groups and communities.\nPriorities should consider where countries stand on the interlinked goals.\nFostering international cooperation and closing financing gaps for sustainable development is critical to enable the transition toward more sustainable, low-carbon, and resilient economies. Achieving a world free of poverty on a livable planet is possible but requires serious and immediate efforts.\nData is the infrastructure for policy and should therefore be prioritized. The analysis presented in this report relies to a large extent on household survey data. While data availability has improved in many countries, less than half of the countries in the world had a household survey available for poverty monitoring in 2020 or later. This reflects issues of coverage and accessibility.\nThe expanded vision of the World Bank, with a new focus on shared prosperity and the inclusion of a livable planet, calls for substantial improvements to the quality of data. New indicators require good coverage of the entire global distribution of income and consumption, detailed spatial data on exposure to climate-related risks, and multidimensional poverty.\nIn light of the data revolution, significant investments are needed to modernize surveys, and accelerate the integration and standardization of various sources of data. At the same time, efforts should focus on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence models to close data gaps and enable more timely monitoring.\nBackground Papers: Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet Report 2024\nReproducibility package for Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet Report 2024\nPoverty, Prosperity, and Planet Report 2024: Overview Figures\nBlogs:\n\u279c Pathways Out of Poverty toward a More Prosperous Future\n\u279c Blueprint for Change: Ending Poverty on a Livable Planet is Possible\n\u279c The Polycrisis Behind a Lost Decade of Poverty Reduction\n\u279c A Higher Standard of Poverty in a Changing World: The World Bank\u2019s Poverty Line of $6.85\n\u279c Global Poverty and Climate Goals Will Remain Out of Reach with Business-As-Usual Policies\n\u279c Getting to Zero: Focusing on IDA Countries for Ending Poverty\n\u279c Filling the Gaps in Survey Data for a World Free of Poverty on a Livable Planet\n\u279c The Geography of High Inequality: Monitoring the World Bank\u2019s New Indicator\n\u279c The Demographic Profile of the Global Poor: Who are the Poor and Where do they Live?\n\u279c Global Prosperity Gap: the World Bank\u2019s new measure for shared prosperity\n\u279c The Prosperity Gap incorporates a penalty for high inequality\n\u279c Three ways to use the Prosperity Gap index\n---------------------------------------\nPress Release: English | Fran\u00e7ais | Espa\u00f1ol | \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a | \u4e2d\u6587 | \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\nBrochure: Poverty and Inequality Update, Oct 2024\nPre-Launch Event: Poverty, Prosperity, and Livable Planet: Pathways Out of the Polycrisis"

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that despite widespread fears and negative narratives, global progress in poverty reduction, life expectancy, and living standards has been substantial over the past four decades, largely driven by capitalism and trade. It highlights improvements in health, safety, and civil rights, while acknowledging persistent challenges such as mental health, climate change, and economic inequality. The author emphasizes that historical doomsday predictions have repeatedly failed, urging a more optimistic perspective grounded in empirical evidence.",
