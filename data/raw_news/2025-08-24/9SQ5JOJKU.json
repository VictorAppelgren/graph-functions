  "description": "Russia has accused Ukraine of drone strikes that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in the Kursk region Sunday as Ukraine marked its Independence Day",
  "content": "Ukraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack.\n\nFirefighters also responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia\u2019s Leningrad region, home to a major fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, with debris igniting the fire.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight into Sunday.\n\nRussia fired 72 drones and decoys, along with a cruise missile, into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Of these, 48 drones were shot down or jammed.\n\nThe incidents occurred as Ukraine marked Independence Day, commemorating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered remarks in a video address from Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square, emphasizing the nation\u2019s resolve.\n\n\u201cWe are building a Ukraine that will have enough strength and power to live in security and peace,\u201d Zelenskyy said, calling for a \u201cjust peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat our future will be is up to us alone,\u201d he said, in a nod to the U.S.\u2013Russia summit in Alaska earlier in August, which many feared would leave Ukrainian and European interests sidelined.\n\n\u201cAnd the world knows this. And the world respects this. It respects Ukraine. It perceives Ukraine as an equal,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg was in attendance at Independence Day celebrations in Kyiv, during which Zelenskyy awarded him the Ukrainian Order of Merit, of the 1st degree.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in Kyiv on Sunday morning for meetings with Zelenskyy.\n\n\u201cOn this special day \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day \u2014 it is especially important for us to feel the support of our friends. And Canada has always stood by our side,\u201d wrote Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nIn a joint news conference with Zelenskyy, Carney said Canada will invest 2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.5 billion) in new military assistance for Ukraine to boost its army and provide urgently needed weapons.\n\nZelenskyy said the two leaders were considering the presence of Canadian forces on the ground in Ukraine as part of a reassurance force.\n\nNorway announced significant new military aid Sunday, pledging about 7 billion kroner ($695 million) for air defense systems. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said Norway and Germany are jointly funding two Patriot systems, including missiles, with Norway also helping procure air defense radar.\n\nPope Leo XIV prayed Sunday for peace in Ukraine as he marked the country\u2019s Independence Day with a special appeal during his weekly noon blessing. He said the faithful were joining Ukrainians \u201casking that the Lord give peace to their martyred country.\u201d\n\nLeo also sent a telegram to Zelenskyy, which the Ukrainian leader posted on X along with similar notes from other world leaders.\n\nIn the letter, Leo assured his prayers for all Ukrainians who are suffering, and wrote: \u201cI implore the Lord to move the hearts of people of good will, that the clamor of arms may fall silent and give way to dialogue, opening the path to peace for the good of all.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s troops continued their push in eastern and northern Ukraine, where Russia claimed Saturday that its forces had seized two villages in the Donetsk region. The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukraine had taken back control of the village of Novomykhailivka, also in the Donetsk region.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Sunday that 146 Russian servicemen had been returned from Ukraine, in exchange for the same number of Ukrainian servicemen. The ministry said the latest exchange also included eight residents of Russia\u2019s Kursk region, which was subject to a surprise Ukrainian incursion in August 2024, who were returned to Russia after being held in Ukraine.\n\nShortly after the Russian announcement, Zelenskyy said \u201cour people are coming home.\" He said that those being exchanged included members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and civilians. \u201cMost of them had been in captivity since 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nZelenskyy did not confirm the number of prisoners involved in the exchange.\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

      "text": "Ukraine\u2019s week-old incursion into Russia has embarrassed Putin. How will it affect the war?\nUkraine\u2019s week-old incursion into Russia has embarrassed Putin. How will it affect the war?\nThe swift Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region that began last week has been the largest cross-border raid by Kyiv\u2019s forces in the nearly 2 \u00bd-year war, and has exposed Russia\u2019s vulnerabilities and dealt a painful blow to the Kremlin.\nThe Russian military has thus far struggled to deal with the surprise attack, which has led tens of thousands of civilians to flee the region.\nFor Ukraine, the raid has provided a much-needed boost to morale at a time when its undermanned and under-gunned forces are facing relentless Russian attacks along the more than 1,000 kilometer (620-mile) front line.\nHere\u2019s a look at the Ukrainian raid and its implications:\nHow has the attack unfolded?\nKyiv\u2019s troops poured into the Kursk region from several directions last Tuesday, quickly overwhelming a few checkpoints and field fortifications manned by lightly armed border guards and infantry units along the region\u2019s 245-kilometer (152-mile) frontier with Ukraine.\nUnlike previous raids conducted by small groups of anti-Kremlin Russian volunteers fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, the incursion into the Kursk region reportedly involved units from several battle-hardened Ukrainian army brigades.\nRussian military bloggers reported that Ukrainian mobile groups comprised of several armored vehicles each quickly drove dozens of kilometers into Russian territory, bypassing Russian fortifications and sowing panic throughout the region.\nMatthew Savill, military sciences director at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said Monday that Ukrainian forces had pushed up to 30 kilometers (19 miles) in some directions. He also said the total area covered by the incursion appears to be around 400 square kilometers (154 square miles), although it is unclear how much of that territory they actually control.\nSavill said there\u2019s evidence that up to 10,000 Ukrainian troops from at least four brigades \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 being involved, and that they\u2019re using Western-provided equipment, including infantry fighting vehicles.\nThe Ukrainian forces have widely used drones to strike Russian military vehicles and deployed electronic warfare assets to jam Russian drones and suppress military communications.\nWhile small Ukrainian mobile groups roam the region without trying to consolidate control, other troops reportedly have started digging defensive fortifications in certain areas, including the western part of Sudzha, a town about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border.\nHow is the Russian military responding?\nCaught off guard, Russian troops failed to mount a quick response. With the bulk of their army engaged in the offensive in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, few troops were left to protect the Kursk border area. The Russian units that were there consisted mostly of poorly trained conscripts who were easily overcome by seasoned Ukrainian units, according to Russian military bloggers. Some conscripts were captured.\nThe manpower shortage led Russia\u2019s military command to initially rely on warplanes and helicopter gunships to try to counter the attack. Advancing Ukrainian forces managed to down at least one Russian helicopter damaged another, according to Russian military bloggers.\nRussian reinforcements, including elite special forces units and hardened Wagner mercenaries, have started to arrive in the Kursk region, but so far they appear to have failed to dislodge the Ukrainian troops from Sudzha and other areas.\nSome of the newly arriving troops appear to have lacked combat skills and suffered casualties. In one example, a convoy of military trucks carelessly stopped on the roadside near a combat area and was pummeled by Ukrainian fire.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that Ukraine lost 945 soldiers in four days of fighting, though it didn\u2019t say how many Russians had died and its claims couldn\u2019t be independently verified.\nWhat are Ukrainian authorities saying about the incursion?\nZelenskyy confirmed for the first time that Kyiv\u2019s forces are operating in the Kursk region and said the incursion was \u201cpurely a security issue for Ukraine.\u201d\nIn a video posted Monday to his Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian military was hitting back at Russian forces that had launched strikes at Ukraine from the Kursk region.\nIt is \u201cabsolutely fair\u201d to attack Russian positions, including airfields and logistics used to strike Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, adding the goal of the mission was \u201cliberation of the border from the Russian military.\u201d\nIn the video, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, also told the president that Kyiv\u2019s forces control 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of the Kursk region. The claim could not be independently verified.\nZelenskyy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak suggested last week that such an operation would improve Kyiv\u2019s hand in any future negotiations with Moscow.\n\u201cWhen will it be possible to conduct a negotiation process in a way that we can push them or get something from them? Only when the war is not going on according to their scenarios,\u201d he said.\nWhat is the Kremlin saying?\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has described the incursion as a \u201clarge-scale provocation\u201d that involved \u201cindiscriminate shelling of civilian buildings, residential houses and ambulances.\u201d\nPutin suggested that the Ukrainian attack is an attempt by Kyiv to stop Moscow\u2019s offensive in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region and gain leverage in possible future peace talks. Speaking to his top officials Monday, he vowed that Moscow would fulfill all of its military goals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the enemy will keep trying to destabilize the situation in the border zone to try to destabilize the domestic political situation in our country,\u201d Putin said. Russia\u2019s main task is \u201cto squeeze out, drive the enemy out of our territories and, together with the border service, to ensure reliable cover of the state border.\u201d\nThe Kursk region\u2019s acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, said Monday that Ukrainian forces had taken control of 28 settlements. He said 12 civilians had been killed and 121 others, including 10 children, had been wounded since the start of the incursion. About 121,000 people have left or been evacuated from combat areas, he said.\nRussia announced a federal emergency in the Kursk region and declared a counterterrorism operation there and in the neighboring Belgorod and Bryansk regions, giving local authorities more powers to quickly coordinate an emergency response and tighten security.\nRussian state propaganda has focused on the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to provide assistance to displaced residents while playing down the military\u2019s unpreparedness for the attack.\nWhat are Ukraine\u2019s goals and how could the situation unfold?\nBy launching the incursion, Kyiv could be aiming to force the Kremlin to divert resources from Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, where Russian forces have pressed offensives in several sectors and made slow but steady gains. If Ukraine manages to hold on to some of its Kursk gains, that would strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future peace talks and could allow it to trade them for Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.\nThe incursion has also dealt a blow to the Kremlin, highlighting its failure to protect the country and shattering Putin\u2019s narrative that Russia has remained largely unscathed by the hostilities.\nThe incursion also has sent a strong signal to Kyiv\u2019s allies that the Ukrainian military could seize the initiative in the war \u2014 a message particularly important ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\nBut despite the initial successes, the foray into Russia might cause attrition in some of Ukraine\u2019s most capable units and leave troops in Donetsk without vital reinforcements.\nTrying to establish a lasting presence in the Kursk region could be challenging for the Ukrainian forces, whose supply lines would be vulnerable to Russian fire.\n\u201cSustaining a force of any size in Russia and defending against counterattacks will be hard, given the limited reserves available to Ukraine,\u201d said Savill, of RUSI."

He remembers thinking the fight for autonomy would take decades.\nInstead, it came much sooner than he ever imagined. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine quickly declared independence in 1991 and later conducted a referendum backed by more than 90% of voters.\n\u201dI was preparing myself for prisons and labor camps, and I thought the struggle would last about 20\u201330 years,\u201d Donii told The Associated Press.\nMoscow\u2019s grip endured after independence\nAs the country marks 34 years since that monumental event Sunday, Donii and others from Ukraine\u2019s first generation of lawmakers and activists describe how despite separation from the Soviet Union, Moscow\u2019s grip endured. Russia used political pressure, social division and the sidelining of pro-Western voices. That eventually paved the way for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three decades later and Ukraine\u2019s current fight for independence and identity in the face of its aggressive neighbor.\nBack in 1990, Donii and other student leaders of a hunger strike were calling not only for breaking away from Moscow but also for renewing the political system at home.\nTheir first proposal was to conduct snap elections for Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, which Donii saw as essential for clearing out the Soviet-era lawmakers still in office. The idea, however, failed to gain broad support even among pro-independence forces.\n\u201cUkraine, having won independence, did not win the removal of the Communist ruling class,\u201d he said.\nIn his view, opportunities that were within reach in the early 1990s slipped away, leaving Ukraine to pay a high price today as it presses toward the European Union and NATO not as distant aspirations but as urgent necessities for safeguarding sovereignty and securing an independent path.\nOleksandr Nechyporenko, a lawmaker from the first Ukrainian Parliament, remembers how fragmented society was on the verge of independence.\n\u201cA very large part was neutral, it included people who wavered, who didn\u2019t have enough information,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was also a big and powerful core that was categorically in favor of preserving the Soviet Union, communist rule, ties with Russia, and so on.\u201d Nechyporenko says the \u201cpassionate change-makers\u201d were a minority.\n\u2018We should have been more firm\u2019\nIn his view, Ukraine\u2019s tolerance toward agents of Russian influence since the early days of its independence was a major mistake. \u201cWe should have been more firm, more radical,\u201d he said.\nThat sense of missed resolve is not limited to politics alone. Decisions made in the early years of independence continue to weigh heavily as Ukraine now fights for survival against Russia. One of the most consequential was the choice to surrender the vast nuclear arsenal left on Ukrainian soil after the Soviet collapse.\n\u201cThe path we were supposed to take with the world\u2019s third-largest nuclear arsenal \u2014 about five thousand nuclear warheads \u2014 that path should have given us the opportunity to effectively use this potential for integration with the West,\u201d said Yurii Kostenko, a scholar and politician who led negotiations on Ukraine\u2019s nuclear disarmament in the early 1990s.\nHe says that while leading the negotiation process, his vision of nuclear disarmament included the U.S. assisting Ukraine financially and technologically to turn nuclear warheads into fuel for nuclear power plants. Accession to NATO would have been Ukraine\u2019s guarantee of security. The American side was ready to make it happen, Kostenko says.\nA deal to give Russia its nuclear warheads\nBut instead of cooperation with the U.S., Kostenko recalls Ukraine being eventually pressured into surrendering its warheads to Russia, receiving almost nothing in return. He said to achieve that, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded Kostenko\u2019s dismissal as leader of the negotiations by Ukraine\u2019s then-President Leonid Kravchuk. That demand was granted.\nNo longer led by Kostenko, Ukraine\u2019s delegation dropped the initial plan codesigned with the U.S. and chose to cooperate with Russia instead. Kostenko says that in exchange for its nukes, Ukraine received $1.5 billion in nuclear fuel and natural gas from Russia, which, he says, was worth around 1% of what Ukraine gave up.\nInstead of NATO accession, Ukraine received the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement in which Ukraine was granted assurances of sovereignty and territorial integrity from the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia. For many Ukrainians, it has become a symbol of promises that carried no weight. Moscow shredded the agreement first with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then with the full-scale invasion in 2022. Three decades later, as Ukraine once again negotiates its future with Western partners under the shadow of Russian aggression, the choices and compromises of the 1990s still loom large, shaping its search for lasting security."

      "text": "Canada will match US tariff exemptions under USMCA trade pact, Prime Minister Carney says\nCanada will match US tariff exemptions under USMCA trade pact, Prime Minister Carney says\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canada is dropping many of its retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday.\nCarney said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties, easing Canada\u2019s previous stance on holding the line on punitive tariffs until U.S. President Donald Trump relents more on those imposed by the U.S.\nSome Canadian politicians and union leaders characterized Carney\u2019s move as capitulation, but the prime minister accentuated what he considered Canada\u2019s favorable position so far and said that the exemptions would jump-start further trade talks with Washington.\n\u201cCanada currently has the best trade deal with the United States. And while it\u2019s different from what we had before, it\u2019s still better than that of any other country,\u201d Carney said.\nCarney and Trump spoke on the phone Thursday, and Carney met with his Cabinet on Friday before making the announcement.\n\u201cWe had a very good call,\u201d Trump said Friday in the Oval Office. \u201cWe are working on something. We want to be very good to Canada. I like Carney a lot. I think he\u2019s a very good person.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am fighting for the United States, and Canada and Mexico have taken a lot of our business over the years.\u201d\nCarney said Trump told him that lifting the tariffs would reset trade negotiations. The United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026, and Carney called the pact a unique advantage for Canada at a time when it is clear that the U.S. is charging for access to its market.\nCarney said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA means that over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be free of tariffs. He said the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods is 5.6% and remains the lowest among all its trading partners.\nCanadian and Mexican companies can claim preferential treatment under the USMCA.\nCanada and China are the only countries that have retaliated against Trump in his trade war. Canada imposed 25% tariffs on a long list of American goods in March, including oranges, alcohol, clothing and shoes, motorcycles and cosmetics.\nFormer Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially put on retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. tariffs, but before the U.S. tariffs were applied the Trump administration exempted goods covered by the free trade deal.\nMost imports from Canada and Mexico are still protected by the USMCA, but U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said, \u201cI think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA.\u201d\nPreserving the free trade pact will be critical for Canada and Mexico. More than 75% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S. while more than 80% of Mexico\u2019s exports go there.\nTrump has announced some sector-specific tariffs that do apply for Canada despite the USMCA \u2014 known as 232 tariffs \u2014 which are having an impact on the Canadian economy. There is a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, for example.\n\u201cCanada and the United States have reestablished free trade for the vast majority of our goods,\u201d Carney said. \u201cCanada will retain our tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos as we work intensively to resolve the issues there.\u201d\nCarney previously rescinded Canada\u2019s plan to tax U.S. technology firms after Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over those plans, which he called \u201ca direct and blatant attack on our country.\u201d\nThe prime minister disputed any notion that Canada is appeasing Trump, noting that Canada is matching what the U.S. is doing.\n\u201cThe president and I had a long conversation,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThere is a review of the free trade agreement in the spring. We\u2019re starting our preparations.\u201d\nLana Payne, president of Unifor, Canada\u2019s largest private sector union, characterized Carney\u2019s announcement as Canada backing down, and said the country shouldn\u2019t back down unless the U.S. drops all punitive tariffs.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s attacks on auto, steel, aluminum, and forestry sectors are hurting Canadian workers in real time,\u201d she posted on social media. \u201cWalking back counter-tariffs isn\u2019t an olive branch. It only enables more U.S. aggression.\u201d\nOpposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre called it a capitulation by Carney. Poilievre said he would have gone to the U.S. president and asked him respectfully to remove all the tariffs.\n\u201cAny small tariff on Canada, any amount, by the United States has an outsized effect because more than 20% of our economy is exports to the U.S.,\u201d he said."

  "argos_summary": "Ukraine and Russia engaged in a drone exchange on Ukraine's Independence Day, with Ukraine launching 72 drones and Russia intercepting 95, while Russian forces seized two Ukrainian villages and later returned 146 servicemen in a prisoner swap. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy celebrated Independence Day, received international support from Canada, Norway, and the Pope, and discussed potential Canadian ground forces. Russia launched a large-scale incursion into its Kursk region, claiming Ukrainian forces captured up to 400 square kilometers, prompting Russian countermeasures and a declaration of emergency. The incursion is seen as a strategic move to pressure Russia and boost Ukraine's negotiating position, though it risks attrition and logistical challenges.",
