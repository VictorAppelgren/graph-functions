  "content": "Everything You Need To Know About Craftsman's Electric Riding Lawn Mower Before You Buy\n\nFor those who want to maintain their yard without the extra trouble of pushing a mower around, a riding model might be ideal. If you've been shopping for lawn equipment lately, you've likely noticed an increasing number of electric options. Battery-powered riding mowers are gaining traction in the market as a solid alternative to their traditional gasoline counterparts. With no need for fuel, quieter operation, and no fumes, some homeowners are choosing these electric machines. And iconic brands like Craftsman are offering compelling reasons to give electric a try, with its 56V MAX Cordless Brushless 30-inch Compact Riding Lawn Mower. A number of outdoor Craftsman tools could help take your yard to the next level, but options like its 30-inch electric riding mower may not be for everyone, especially considering its $3,779 price tag. With several other Craftsman models to choose from, like gasoline-powered lawn tractors, zero turns, and other compact machines, you'll want to learn as much as you can about the electric option to see if it's right for you.\n\nHow long will the batteries run on a single charge and how long does charging take? One of the biggest concerns when shopping for an electric mower is whether or not it'll have enough juice to finish cutting your lawn. Unfortunately, it depends on a few factors, such as how large your property is, whether it's hilly, and how often you mow. Generally, the Craftsman's two brushless motors will run for up to 60 minutes on a single charge, which isn't as long as the batteries last in Ryobi's RM480E electric riding lawn mower. Still, you could conceivably cover around an acre before the unit would need to be charged. Once the battery is depleted, plug the included charger into the mower's charging port and into an electrical outlet. According to Craftsman, the battery should be fully charged within four hours. Fortunately, if you forget about it, leaving the battery plugged in for longer than the suggested charge time won't harm it.\n\nCan you replace the battery and how long will it last? The battery in the Craftsman electric mower should only be replaced by a qualified technician at an authorized dealer. Unlike some other electric mower options from brands like EGO or Ryobi, which use removable battery packs, the battery isn't designed to be removed from the Craftsman. So, if you were hoping to have a backup battery you could connect in the event the mower loses power before the job is done, you're out of luck. In terms of battery lifespan, it depends on how well it's maintained. For example, keeping the Craftsman 56V MAX battery discharged for an extended time could damage it. Other considerations include where the mower is stored, with things like direct sunlight, a moist environment, and extreme temperature swings being factors that could limit the battery's longevity. In general, a lithium-ion mower battery will last around 5 years, or up to 800 charges.\n\nThe cut height describes the measurement of space from the bottom of the deck to the ground, or how tall the grass will be after it's mowed. This electric mower has five different settings, so you can select how short you would like the grass cut. But beyond preferences, the cutting height also comes into play when trying to tame long grass between mows, or tackling an unkempt lawn for the first time. At only 3.5 inches maximum, you'll need to cut your grass to prevent it from growing too high. If you find yourself getting behind on your lawn maintenance, you might struggle with an overgrown lawn, even when the Craftsman mower is set to its highest deck setting. For example, in certain parts of the country, grass species like Bermuda can germinate in as little as one week and become fully established within a month, making them a high-maintenance choice that requires frequent mowing. For comparison, Craftsman's 42-inch Gas Zero-Turn Riding Mower features eight different deck settings with a maximum cut height of 4.5 inches.\n\nWhat kind of warranty does Craftsman offer? Craftsman's electric riding lawn mower comes with a limited three-year warranty, and four years of coverage for the 56V MAX battery. This protection applies to the original buyer and begins on the date of purchase. In order to qualify for warranty repairs, the original receipt is required, and you must take the mower to an authorized warranty service provider. Fortunately, Craftsman has multiple ways to locate one of these providers by contacting the retailer where you bought the mower, going to Craftsman's warranty page, or calling 888-331-4569. Unfortunately, you won't be able to take advantage of the warranty coverage if you bought the mower from an unauthorized dealer. So, if you are interested in this mower, you should purchase it from official Craftsman retailers like Lowe's or Ace. Normal wear and tear of the unit isn't covered, so you'll need to know how and how often to change your riding lawn mower blades, for example. You also won't be reimbursed for costs like transporting the mower to a service provider.",

      "text": "How (And How Often) To Change Your Riding Lawn Mower Blades\nWhile small lawns are easily tended to with push-along lawn mowers, anyone with a large yard will undoubtedly notice the benefit of owning a riding lawn mower. There is a huge variety of options out there, from cost-conscious choices through to all-singing, all-dancing lawn mowers with heaps of power. Regardless of whether you're looking to break the bank on one or not, though, maintenance is all part and parcel of owning a riding lawn mower.\nWhile storing your lawn mower correctly can help prolong the condition of many moving mechanical parts, some items will need semi-regular maintenance, and the blades beneath fall into this category. Sharpening your lawn mower's blades can certainly help to keep them in good shape and cutting grass as effectively as they should, but eventually, they will require replacement, not just rejuvenation. The general rule of thumb is that lawn mower blades are best changed every one or two years, although some will prefer to change them annually, even if there is life left in them. This way, owners can ensure they are always getting a great cut on their grass, and it's unlikely they'll forget if it's an annual task carried out each spring, for example. Changing blades on a riding lawn mower can be an easy DIY task, but it's important to go about it safely.\nChanging your riding mower's blades is an easy and approachable DIY task\nThe first step is to prepare your riding mower. Park it somewhere flat and dry with plenty of space around, and ensure it's turned off with the brakes locked or wheels chocked \u2014 you should also consider disconnecting the spark plugs as an additional safety measure. Secondly, give yourself the most access possible by raising the mower deck to its highest setting. Getting the front of the mower in the air with a small ramp or similar will help here, but just ensure it's secured properly as you would a car on axle stands.\nNow you should be able to access the blades with ease. Grab a suitable wrench and begin to loosen the nut on the blade \u2014 you may require something to block the blade when spinning here. Once the blade is removed, simply install the new blade the correct way up, ensuring it's correct and matches the old blade. Be sure to balance your mower's blades as well, as this will reduce vibration and result in a cleaner cut. Once tightened to your mower's individual torque settings, which should be outlined in the manual, consider tackling any other appropriate servicing while you're there before taking the mower off the ramps and finishing the job."

      "text": "These Outdoor Craftsman Tools Could Help Take Your Yard To The Next Level\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nFew things are more satisfying than looking out your window to a pristine, well-manicured lawn. Not only is it visually appealing, but it gives a sense of accomplishment. It didn't get that way on its own, after all. A lot of hard work goes into cutting the grass, trimming the hedges, pulling weeds, and edging the lawn. If that hard work is what's keeping you from tending to your yard, though, Craftsman has a selection of tools that can make life a little easier and take your yard to the next level.\nWhile you may have grown up simply mowing the lawn as part of your chores, true lawn care is a multistep process that requires care and precision. It's about more than just running a rusty lawn mower over thick patches of grass. Luckily, Craftsman is no stranger to the many facets of creating a beautiful landscape.\nWant a lawn you can really marvel over and brag to the neighbors about? Then consider adding some of these Craftsman tools to your landscaping arsenal.\nString Trimmers for Cleaning Up Weeds\nWeeds. They're the bane of any healthy yard. An overabundance of them, especially taller stalks, can kill grass by blocking out the sun and absorbing the nutrients needed to survive. While a direct dose of chemical weed killer can get the job done, a little maintenance may actually be safer for your yard.\nA Craftsman Weedwacker is a helpful tool for cutting back pesky weeds. There are several string trimmers, from the 159cc Wheeled trimmer to the 25cc 2-Cycle Curved Shaft Weedwacker. However, it may be best to go with Craftsman's best-seller, the V20 Brushless RP String Trimmer.\nEquipped with a brushless motor and a 20V Lithium Ion battery, the trimmer is a straightforward application in your war against weeds. A two-speed toggle and push-button feed to control the swath size helps you easily tackle jobs in your yard.\nAt $149, the Craftsman 20-volt Weedwacker offers a lot of value, but if you need to work around a wall or fence, you may want to consider the 17-inch 25cc 2-Cycle Curved Gas Weedwacker for the same price.\nCut Back Hedges with New Hedge Trimmers\nUnruly hedges can throw off the aesthetics of your yard, but they're also a nuisance to deal with if you don't have the proper tools. If you're still using hedge shears, it's time to upgrade to Craftsman hedge trimmers. A hedge trimmer gives you better control over the shape and length of your hedges for a more uniform look.\nWhereas shears require a lot of effort on your part, especially on larger bushes, a trimmer can get the job done quickly and efficiently. The 23cc 2-Cycle 22-inch Gas Hedge Trimmer is a Craftsman best seller, covering 22 inches of shrubbery and hedges with its stainless steel blade. The durable, 2-cycle full-crank engine powers the blade through up to 1 inch in diameter plant limbs. At $199 for this gas trimmer, you'll enjoy years of beautifully cut, even hedges.\nIf you need more versatility and a greater range of movement, the 25cc 2-Cycle 22-inch Attachment Capable Gas Hedge Trimmer is another Craftsman best seller. Unlike the standard hedge trimmer, this model offers 135 degrees of movement to hit every angle. You'll spend a little more for this model, but the results justify the $229 price tag.\nPerfect the Edge with a Lawn Edger\nThe finishing touch on the perfect lawn is an edger. The blade or wire of an edger will run between the grass and any pavement, including sidewalks and driveways. It may sound silly at first, but an edger creates a fine, clean line that spruces up the appearance of your lawn and enhances all of your hard work.\nCraftsman has two trimmers to consider, and one is far more convenient to use than the other. The 140cc Gas Wheeled Edger resembles a lawnmower with a hazardous side-blade attachment. This $399 lawn tool rolls along nicely, scoring the ground down to 2.25 inches with its 9-inch tri-tip steel blade.\nAlternatively, Craftsman sells a hand-held 12-inch Corded String Trimmer/Edger if you don't want anything too bulky or are happy with a narrower line. Best of all, you can swap between trimming and edging with the dual-purpose application. At only $79.98, this option is considerably cheaper, but don't expect as dramatic a line as with the wheeled edger."

      "text": "How Long Do The Batteries Last In Ryobi's RM480E Electric Riding Lawn Mower?\nThose who need to mow large areas of land on a frequent basis should consider buying a good lawn mower. There are plenty of premium brands on the market, but Ryobi's lawn mowers are generally considered to be worth the investment. The company offers an array of options, from traditional push mowers to drivable mowers, and the vast majority of its products are fully electric, meaning users simply have to keep their unit's battery charged instead of topping it up with gas between mowing sessions.\nRyobi's RM480E Electric Riding Lawn Mower is a solid option for anyone looking to ease the mowing process. The $2,999.00 unit, which takes the form of a small vehicle, allows the user to steer around the mowing area while the built-in mower does the brunt of the work. Most importantly, it's completely battery-operated, a major draw for people inclined to electric tools. But some will want to know more about how long the RM480E's battery life lasts on a single charge, the overall lifespan of its batteries, and how these statistics stack up against other Ryobi mowers. With that in mind, here are all the details about the RM480E's batteries worth knowing.\nWhat kind of battery does the RM480E mower use?\nWhile users can expect all the benefits of a battery-operated lawn mower from the Ryobi RM480E, they may not be too enthused upon learning the sort of batteries that the unit employs. According to Ryobi's official listing for the product, the RM480E runs on a 48V 75Ah battery system made up of four distinct batteries. The issue is that these batteries are of the lead-acid variety, which are prone to degradation and generally considered inferior to alternative options such as lithium-ion batteries.\nVarious user reviews have criticized Ryobi's choice to use lead-acid batteries in the RM480E, as replacing them when they inevitably fail can be costly. The RM480E is only officially compatible with Leoch LPC12-75 or LPC12-100 lead-acid batteries, which can cost anywhere from over $100 to upward of $200 for a single unit. Seeing as the RM480E takes four batteries, the total amount to replace these batteries can approach $800 \u2014 roughly a quarter of the initial price of the mower.\nThe fact that the RM480E relies on lead-acid batteries may be a dealbreaker for those concerned about the longevity of the stock unit's included batteries. However, it's at least worth noting that some reviews of the RM480E have alleged success in replacing the stock batteries with other higher-quality models from well-regarded battery brands.\nHow long does the Ryobi RM480E battery last per charge?\nWhile the use of lead-acid batteries in Ryobi's RM480E may be controversial, users can still expect it to reliably last for extended mowing sessions \u2014 provided that the batteries are charged. The mower's official listing asserts that a fully charged set of batteries in the RM480E can last up to two hours of continuous runtime. Per the company's estimates, the unit can mow approximately two acres of land in that time.\nOf course, the RM480E's two-hour runtime estimate is based on optimal conditions. As the included batteries start to degrade after extended use, even keeping them fully charged may result in a different amount of time for a single mowing session. Thus, it's important to take the appropriate measures to keep the RM480E's batteries as healthy as possible. These steps include keeping the batteries at least partially juiced up when they're not in active use inside the lawn mower and sheltering them from extremely high and low temperatures. Generally speaking, users can take cues from the common ways to prevent regular car batteries from dying.\nWhat's the Ryobi RM480E lawn mower battery's lifespan?\nWhile the optimal battery runtime for the RM480E is solid for many average use cases, some product reviews have reported common problems with Ryobi batteries, including complete battery failure. These issues are common for lawn mower batteries, and Gitnux estimates an average battery lifespan of just one to two years if maintained properly. Various reviews of the RM480E suggest that its included batteries can last anywhere in the range of one to four years before they have to be replaced.\nIt's worth noting that the RM480E comes with a three-year limited warranty from Ryobi, under which the replacement of failed batteries may fall in certain cases. As such, RM480Es that are still under warranty can potentially have one to two replacement batteries covered if they are faulty or fail on the shorter end of their average lifespan. Replacement Leoch LPC12-75 and LPC12-100 batteries have a basic included warranty of one year, though the purchaser has the option to extend the warranty to three years. In the long run, it's likely that users will eventually have to pay out of pocket to replace the RM480E batteries.\nOther Ryobi mowers edge out the RM480E's batteries\nCompared to the rest of Ryobi's electric riding mower options, the RM480E manages to stay within the same relative ballpark regarding battery life. However, there's no denying that a number of the manufacturer's other offerings in this department beat out the RM480E in battery quality and efficiency. For instance, the RM480ex is estimated to hit 2.5 acres' worth of runtime at a relatively comparable price point to the RM480E. Some units punch even higher, such as the ZT480ex and the 80V HP 42-inch Lithium Electric ZTR, which both clock in at a runtime equal to 3 acres. Of course, it's worth noting that these longer-lasting units are a fair bit more expensive than the RM480E.\nThe RM480E does beat out some of Ryobi's other mowers. For example, the 48-Volt 30-inch Riding Lawn Mower and the 80V HP 30-inch Lithium Electric ZTR both have a runtime of just one hour (enough to clear about one acre) compared to the RM480E's two hours.\nBeyond the RM480E's runtime, there's another key reason to consider Ryobi's other rideable lawn mowers: their respective battery configurations. While several other units similarly rely on lead-acid batteries, some use power sources that are generally considered more reliable. For instance, the 80V HP Brushless series of mowers all use lithium-ion batteries, which can have a longer lifespan than their lead-acid counterparts. Of course, users should also consider the possible problems and disadvantages of lithium batteries before taking the plunge."
