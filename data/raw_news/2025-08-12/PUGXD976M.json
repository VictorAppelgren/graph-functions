      "text": "Giant jellyfish as wide as beach umbrella found lurking off New England coast\nKnown as a Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish, the animal was a member of the largest jellyfish species in the world, according to the Smithsonian.\nSOUTH PORTLAND, Maine \u2013 Beachgoers in South Portland, Maine, came upon a curious sight over the weekend, when they spotted a large, orange-red jellyfish lurking in the shallow water.\nKnown as a Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish, the animal is a member of the largest jellyfish species in the world, according to the Smithsonian.\nThe specimen found in South Portland appeared as shaggy as its feline namesake, as hair-like components of its vivid crimson bell floated in the water.\nWhile the bells of Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish grow to around 3 feet wide on average, the Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish found in the small town of South Portland was nearly 5-feet wide, officials said. That means it was wider than many beach umbrellas.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish usually live in colder, more northerly ocean waters, according to officials. However, these animals can be found as far south as Chesapeake Bay.\nThe jellyfish also typically remain in the open ocean and not near coasts, the Smithsonian said. This makes the sighting of the Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish at Willard Beach quite a unique sighting.\nTheir tendency to remain in the open ocean could be due to their size, particularly as the largest known Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish measured 120 feet long from the top of its bell to the end of its tentacles, the institute added.\nLike those of other jellyfish species, Lion\u2019s Mane tentacles contain neurotoxins that can be dangerous to humans. Side effects of being stung by a tentacle of a Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish range from a rash to respiratory issues.\nThe City of South Portland officials provided the following advice for anyone who might stumble upon a Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish at the beach:\n- Do not touch the jellyfish.\n- Observe the animal, and if one washes up on the beach, let a lifeguard know about it so they can help put it back into the water."

      "text": "Mediterranean Sea poised to break all-time heat records\nThe Mediterranean Sea is on track to potentially surpass its all-time highest recorded temperature, with large portions of the basin estimated to be between 5- and 10-degrees Fahrenheit above average, with even locally greater anomalies.\nROME \u2013 The Mediterranean Sea is on track to potentially surpass its all-time highest recorded temperature, with large portions of the basin estimated to be between 5- and 10-degrees Fahrenheit above average, with even locally greater anomalies.\nAccording to satellite data, sea surface temperatures throughout the region have been consistently breaking records through the month of June.\nMost readings are registering in the mid to upper 70s Fahrenheit, and with the hottest months of the season still to come, there appears to be little in store to immediately reverse the warming trend.\nThe warmest average sea surface temperature for the Mediterranean was set just last year, when the basin reached a stunning 84 degrees Fahrenheit in August 2024, surpassing the previous record set in 2023, according to Europe's Copernicus Marine Service.\nALASKA\u2019S LARGEST WILDFIRES OF YEAR RAGE AFTER 31,000 LIGHTNING STRIKES OVER 3-DAY PERIOD\nExtended marine heatwaves are known to damage coral reef ecosystems, and while the Mediterranean Sea does not have extensive reefs compared to the tropics, biologists say it is home to unique coral formations and other marine habitats.\nIn addition to ecological risks, the warming sea surface is influencing weather patterns across Southern Europe and Northern Africa.\nWeather observation sites have recorded elevated dew points in recent days, with some areas reaching the mid-70s Fahrenheit - levels of humidity typically seen in more tropical climates such as the United States' Gulf Coast.\nThis level of added moisture can dramatically increase the heat index and make it harder for the human body to cool down through evaporation.\nStudies estimate that just over 20% of households across Europe have access to air conditioning, which can make any heat wave oppressive.\nElevated sea surface temperatures in the Mediterranean are not just an isolated phenomenon - it is part of a larger global trend, with record warmth observed in most ocean basins over the past few years.\nMany climatologists attribute the long-term warming to climate change, while others point to more regional oscillation patterns as contributing factors.\n2025 ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON GUIDE: HERE\u2019S WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE TROPICS THIS YEAR\nSo what does this mean for the Atlantic hurricane season?\nAt face value, a persistently warm subtropical zone, such as the current Mediterranean setup and nearby waterways, can suppress tropical cyclone formation in the Main Development Region (MDR) of the Atlantic by decreasing atmospheric instability.\nAt the same time, it can also lead to tropical activity in more unusual northern latitudes, outside the classic storm formation zones.\nForecasters will be watching closely to see whether the current anomalies in the Mediterranean Sea migrate more southwestward, which could align with more traditional water temperature patterns.\nA similar setup occurred in 2003, when a boiling Mediterranean was paired with a more lukewarm tropical Atlantic early in the season, but sea temperatures eventually transitioned weeks later, warming the MDR and leading to several long-track Cape Verde hurricanes.\nWhether the 2025 hurricane season follows a similar pattern remains to be seen, but the impacts of the latest Mediterranean heat wave will be monitored for impacts locally and around the globe."

      "text": "Nearly 300 queen conchs found after illegal harvest in Florida Keys\nAccording to NOAA, a queen conch is a large marine snail that reaches up to 12 inches in length and lives up to 30 years. Queen conchs are most commonly found throughout the Caribbean Sea, the Florida Keys and around Bermuda.\nKEY WEST, Fla. - Florida wildlife officials are investigating what they say is the illegal harvest of nearly 300 queen conchs from waters off the Florida Keys, and they are asking the public for help in identifying those responsible.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said they were recently alerted to the discovery of hundreds of empty snail shells at a rental property near Key West.\nInvestigators believe the conchs were illegally harvested for their meat sometime between July 7 and July 10, but the responsible party has still not been located.\nThe agency has not released the identity of any suspects and said that the queen conchs are protected under Florida law because of declining populations caused by overharvesting and habitat destruction.\nBiologists say queen conchs are bottom dwellers that feed on algae in seagrass beds and play an important role in the natural ecosystem.\nNOAA Fisheries reports the species can grow up to 12 inches long and live for as many as 30 years.\nBIOLOGISTS RESCUE ENDANGERED SAWFISH IN FLORIDA KEYS AS RACE TO SAVE SPECIES UNDERWAY\nThe marine snails are found throughout the Caribbean Sea, around the Florida Keys and near Bermuda.\nAlthough queen conch meat is considered a delicacy and is featured in some seafood restaurants, their supply comes from farms in the Caribbean and Bahamas, not Florida waters.\nThrough aquaculture, harvesters raise larvae in hatcheries and release them once they grow larger or continue raising them in enclosed environments.\nIn Florida, harvesting queen conchs from the wild is a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by fines and possible jail time.\nSEE THE MASSIVE ALLIGATOR FOUND LURKING IN A SOUTH FLORIDA SWAMP\nFWC officials are seeking eyewitness accounts from anyone who may have observed suspicious activity or have video of the property or surrounding waters that could help identify suspects.\nAnyone with information is urged to contact the FWC\u2019s Wildlife Alert Hotline at 888-404-3922 or submit an anonymous tip through the agency\u2019s online system.\nThe case is one of the largest in recent memory, with most illegal harvest cases involving only a few dozen of the mollusks."

      "text": "Nuclear Power in the World Today\n- The first commercial nuclear power stations started operation in the 1950s.\n- Nuclear energy now provides about 9% of the world's electricity from about 440 power reactors.\n- Nuclear provides about one-quarter of the world\u2019s low-carbon electricity.\n- Nuclear is the world's second largest source of low-carbon power.\n- Over 50 countries utilize nuclear energy in about 220 research reactors. In addition to research, these reactors are used for the production of medical and industrial isotopes, as well as for training.\nNuclear technology uses the energy released by splitting the atoms of certain elements. It was first developed in the 1940s, and during the Second World War research initially focused on producing bombs. In the 1950s attention turned to the peaceful use of nuclear fission, controlling it for power generation. For more information, see page on History of Nuclear Energy.\nCivil nuclear power can now boast around 20,000 reactor years of operating experience, and nuclear power plants are operational in 31 countries worldwide. In fact, through regional transmission grids, many more countries depend in part on nuclear-generated power, particularly in Europe.\nWhen the commercial nuclear industry began in the 1960s, there were clear boundaries between the industries of the East and West. Today, the nuclear industry is characterized by international commerce. A reactor under construction in Asia today may have components supplied from South Korea, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Russia, and other countries. Similarly, uranium from Australia or Namibia may end up in a reactor in the UAE, having been converted in France, enriched in the Netherlands, deconverted in the UK and fabricated in South Korea.\nThe uses of nuclear technology extend well beyond the provision of low-carbon energy. It helps control the spread of disease, assists doctors in their diagnosis and treatment of patients, and powers our most ambitious missions to explore space. These varied uses position nuclear technologies at the heart of the world's efforts to achieve sustainable development. For more information, see page on Nuclear Energy and Sustainable Development.\nKey statistics\nIn 2023 nuclear plants supplied 2602 TWh of electricity, up from 2545 TWh in 2022.\nFigure 1: Nuclear electricity production 1970-2023 (source: World Nuclear Association, IAEA PRIS)\nFigure 2: World electricity production by source 2022 (source: International Energy Agency)\nFourteen countries in 2023 produced at least one-quarter of their electricity from nuclear. France gets up to around 70% of its electricity from nuclear energy, while Ukraine, Slovakia and Hungary get about half from nuclear. Japan was used to relying on nuclear power for more than one-quarter of its electricity and is expected to return to somewhere near that level.\nFigure 3: Nuclear generation by country 2023 (source: World Nuclear Association, IAEA PRIS)\nDevelopments in 2025\nGrid connections\nConstruction starts\nPermanent shutdowns\nWorld overview\nAll parts of the world are involved in nuclear power development.

The island's last reactor was shut down in May 2025.\n\u2020 Under Construction figures include a number of units where construction is currently suspended: Angra 3 (Brazil); Ohma 1 and Shimane 3 (Japan); Khmelnitski 3&4 (Ukraine).\n\u2021 Ukraine 2023 electricity generation estimated.\nEmerging nuclear energy countries\nAs outlined above, Bangladesh and Turkey are constructing their first nuclear power plants. A number of other countries are moving towards use of nuclear energy for power production. For more information, see page on Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries.\nImproved performance from existing reactors\nThe performance of nuclear reactors has improved substantially over time. Over the last 40 years the proportion of reactors reaching high capacity factors has increased significantly.\nFigure 4: Long-term trends in capacity factors (source: World Nuclear Association, IAEA PRIS)\nIt is also notable that there is no significant age-related trend in the mean capacity factor for reactors over the last five years.\nFigure 5: Mean capacity factor 2018-2023 by age of reactor (source: World Nuclear Association, IAEA PRIS)\nNeed for new generating capacity\nThere is a clear need for new generating capacity around the world, both to replace old fossil fuel units, especially coal-fired ones, which emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, and to meet increased demand for electricity in many countries. In 2022, 61% of electricity was generated from the burning of fossil fuels. Despite the strong support for, and growth in, intermittent renewable electricity sources in recent years, the fossil fuel contribution to power generation has not changed significantly in the last 15 years or so (66.5% in 2005).\nThe OECD International Energy Agency publishes annual scenarios related to energy. In its World Energy Outlook 20241 the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) \"maps out a way to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C stabilization in the rise in global average temperatures, alongside universal access to modern energy by 2030.\" The NZE in WEO 2024 sees nuclear capacity increase to 1017 GWe by 2050. See information page on IEA Scenarios and the Outlook for Nuclear Power.\nOther nuclear reactors\nIn addition to commercial nuclear power plants, there are about 220 research reactors operating in over 50 countries, with more under construction. As well as being used for research and training, many of these reactors produce medical and industrial isotopes.\nThe use of reactors for marine propulsion is mostly confined to the major navies where it has played an important role for five decades, providing power for submarines and large surface vessels. Over 160 ships, mostly submarines, are propelled by some 200 nuclear reactors and over 13,000 reactor years of experience have been gained with marine reactors. Russia and the USA have decommissioned many of their nuclear submarines from the Cold War era.\nRussia also operates a fleet of large nuclear-powered icebreakers and has more under construction. It has also connected a floating nuclear power plant with two 32 MWe reactors to the grid in the remote arctic region of Pevek. The reactors are adapted from those powering icebreakers.\nFor more information see page on The Many Uses of Nuclear Technology.\nNotes & references\nReferences\n1.

  "argos_summary": "Four reactors at France's Gravelines nuclear power plant were temporarily shut down due to a jellyfish swarm clogging water intake systems, although safety was not compromised. The incident reflects a broader trend of jellyfish affecting coastal power plants, exacerbated by rising sea temperatures linked to climate change. Despite the shutdown, France has managed to meet its electricity demand, as the country relies heavily on nuclear energy for about 70% of its power generation.",
