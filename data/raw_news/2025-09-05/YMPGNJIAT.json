It may not sound like much, but consider a B2B firm mailing out hundreds, even thousands, of checks a month. All of a sudden, that 7.4% increase becomes significant.\n\nAnd add to that the fact that the delivery time for first class mail has become more opaque and delayed, and the downstream business impact can frequently result in delayed settlements, cash trapped in float, and strained supplier relationships.\n\nFirms are doing the math: While a check may appear inexpensive on its face, the fully loaded cost of issuing and processing one is considerably higher. And while enterprise inertia has been the most powerful ally of paper checks, rising fraud and broader pressures on corporate finance have pushed the economics of paper-based payments into sharp relief.\n\nRead more: B2B Firms Are Betting on Time to Cash to Manage Uncertainty\n\nIn the year 2025, against a dynamic macro backdrop, paper-based B2B payments are no longer just inefficient but strategically risky.\n\nThe August 2025 report, \u201cFact vs. Fiction in Real-Time Payments Fraud,\u201d published by PYMNTS Intelligence and The Clearing House, found that paper checks are one of the most exposed instruments to financial crime, with 63% of firms reporting check fraud.\n\nAt the same time, relying on legacy methods is leaving firms stuck in the dust as their peers accelerate innovation initiatives around artificial intelligence and back-office automation.\n\n\u201cIt would be like saying, hey, is having GPS a nice to have, or is it essential? Most people would say today it\u2019s essential. Sure, you could go back to having a map, but why, when you\u2019ve got all these nice tools available?\u201d Chris Wyatt, chief strategy officer at Finexio, told PYMNTS. \u201cThink about those manual repetitive tasks that are expensive for your team. Ideally, it\u2019s probably not what you hired your team to do.\u201d\n\nAccording to \u201cVirtual Mobility: How Mobile Virtual Cards Elevate B2B Payments,\u201d done in collaboration with WEX, almost 73% of businesses have yet to automate supplier payments, significantly limiting their ability to gain a comprehensive view of money movement.\n\nBy contrast, companies that invest in digital payment systems can differentiate themselves. Faster settlement supports supplier stability, strengthens ecosystems, and enables collaborative financing arrangements. In effect, payments are shifting from back-office tasks to strategic levers of competitiveness.\n\nFindings in \u201cThe 2024-2025 Growth Corporates Working Capital Index,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report commissioned by Visa, reveal that the integration of suppliers through digital means, as their billing systems are linked to the buyers\u2019 payment operations, can improve cash flow for both parties, and by extension, create B2B ecosystems that are efficient.\n\nRead more: Picking the Optimal Payment Mix for B2B Growth\n\nWhile paper checks once allowed buyers to control float, or the time between issuing payment and funds clearing, the value of that float is eroding. Suppliers that wait days or weeks to receive funds may downgrade those customers in allocation decisions, especially in constrained supply environments. Faster-paying buyers can gain access to priority inventory, favorable contract terms, or simply stronger relationships.\n\nSimilarly, CFOs traditionally justified paper checks as a tool for managing working capital. By delaying funds leaving the bank account, businesses could eke out additional days of liquidity. But electronic alternatives now offer more precise, and often more valuable, ways to optimize capital.\n\nAutomated systems enable dynamic discounting, where suppliers accept early payment in exchange for modest reductions in invoice totals. Common structures such as \u201c2/10 net 30\u201d give buyers a 2% discount for paying within 10 days rather than 30. On a large spend base, this adds up to big savings, far outweighing the marginal benefits of holding float for a few extra days.\n\nAt the same time, digital payments provide clearer visibility into outflows, improving forecasting and enabling more proactive cash deployment strategies.\n\nStill, paper checks are unlikely to disappear overnight. Cultural inertia, smaller supplier preferences, and uneven access to digital infrastructure will keep them in circulation for years. But their position has fundamentally shifted. What was once seen as the safe, default option is now the most expensive and operationally risky.\n\nThe broader context is a transformation in how businesses view payments. No longer mere administrative settlements, they are emerging as tools of strategic advantage.",

      "text": "While some consumer-facing businesses may consider paper checks, batch ACH transfers and even wire instructions delivered over fax machines to be archaic, many B2B firms consider them infrastructure that works.\nAt the very least, it\u2019s infrastructure that mostly works slowly and expensively, if predictably.\nBut it\u2019s this existing infrastructure and its predictability that many in the B2B space have built their businesses around. And if there\u2019s one constant dominating the B2B marketplace, it\u2019s that businesses will always need to move money in ways that align with their operational realities.\nToday, however, B2B payments are in the midst of one of the most significant shifts in their history. Real-time transfers, virtual cards and embedded finance platforms are colliding with the rising demand for automation, security and global reach. The result is a landscape of extraordinary potential but also complex decision-making when it comes to B2B payments optimization, or matching payment needs between buyers and suppliers.\nB2B payment optimization isn\u2019t something that\u2019s necessarily exciting. But it\u2019s something that is becoming increasingly necessary, particularly as macro uncertainty makes every existing business relationship more valuable.\nSee also: B2B Payments Enter Their Trust-Building Era\nAn Emerging Operating System of B2B Payments\nUnlike consumer payments, where adoption curves tend to converge quickly around a handful of standards, the B2B side defies one-size-fits-all solutions. Every industry brings its own quirks: a construction contractor has to juggle unpredictable cash flows, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup looks to sclae across multiple geographies, and a manufacturer has to manage hundreds of supplier relationships. Each must balance speed, cost, visibility and compliance in very different ways.\nThe \u201coptimal mix\u201d of payment technologies is therefore not a universal recipe but a strategy tailored to the company\u2019s ecosystem and appetite for risk.\nBut given the diversity of variables, how should companies approach the task of building an optimal payment mix? The most successful B2B payments optimization strategies can often start with diagnostic clarity.\nFinance leaders might, for example, map their transaction flows: which payments are high-value and low-frequency, which are small but recurring, where are the pain points in reconciliation and how much working capital flexibility is required.\nThe double-edged sword, however, is that finance teams looking to optimize their payment mix may be hamstrung by their own un-optimized incumbent processes.\nRead more: How Embedded Finance, AI and Automation Are Redefining B2B Payment Networks\nA Playbook for Payment Strategy\nPerhaps the most profound transformation is the rise of embedded finance, where payment functionality is woven directly into the platforms businesses already use. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, procurement software and vertical SaaS products are bundling payment initiation, approval workflows and reconciliation as native features.\nFor companies, this integration reduces the problem of toggling between bank portals, spreadsheets and accounting systems. Payments become a seamless extension of core operations. For example, a construction management platform might allow contractors to pay subcontractors directly within project software, automatically linking payments to project budgets and milestones.\nEmbedded finance also creates new opportunities for financing. Platforms can offer working capital advances, invoice factoring or dynamic discounting at the point of payment, using transaction data to assess risk in real time. This capability is particularly valuable for small- and medium-sized businesses that struggle to access traditional credit lines.\nHowever, embedded models raise strategic questions. Should a company entrust critical treasury functions to a software vendor rather than a bank? What happens if the platform is acquired, or its technology stack changes? Data ownership and regulatory compliance add further layers of complexity.\nAnd while technology options abound, the choice of payment mix ultimately hinges on cash flow strategy. For companies with thin margins and volatile cycles, the timing of inflows and outflows is existential. A logistics firm that pays drivers daily may prioritize real-time disbursements, even at higher cost, to secure labor supply. By contrast, a manufacturer with predictable receivables may lean on ACH for its low fees and batch efficiency, reserving virtual cards for specific procurement categories.\nCrucially, the mix is not static. As networks expand, regulations evolve and corporate strategies shift, treasury teams must revisit their payment architecture regularly. What is optimal today may become suboptimal tomorrow, especially as competitive dynamics push expectations for speed and transparency higher.\nFor finance leaders, the task is to curate a portfolio that balances efficiency, control and resilience."

      "text": "The reason? Amid challenges such as operational uncertainty, ongoing geopolitical friction and supply chain disarray, firms frequently scramble to turn cost centers into levers for resilience.\nGiven the realities of today\u2019s macro backdrop, many businesses are looking no further than one of the most stubbornly analog components of their operations: B2B payments.\nA growing number of firms are turning to virtual cards to digitize payables and even receivables. In doing so, they are discovering strategic advantages beyond cutting paper out of the equation.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs and regulatory complexities are piling up. The latest on the U.S. tariffs, which remain in effect on China and continue impacting sectors like semiconductors, electric vehicles, automobiles and rare earth minerals, have prompted procurement teams to identify alternate suppliers, often across borders and currencies. At the same time, compliance departments are grappling with a surge in know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), and other regulatory checks as global commerce grows more fragmented.\nFor finance departments still reliant on paper checks and legacy wire transfers, these shifts have created friction that\u2019s becoming more than just inconvenient but is veering into the strategically untenable.\nAs chief financial officers face increasing pressure to manage geopolitical risk, maintain liquidity and support business continuity, the case for virtual cards is becoming less about automation and more about optionality.\nRead also: Trump\u2019s Global Tariffs Position CFOs as New Supply Chain Architects\nThe Strategic CFO\u2019s New Virtual Card Mandate\nSuddenly, payment processing time isn\u2019t just about operational efficiency. It\u2019s about supply chain agility.\nVirtual cards, unique, single-use card numbers generated for specific transactions, have been around for more than a decade. Initially positioned as a fraud-reduction tool for corporate travel, they\u2019ve quietly evolved into a robust B2B payment method. What\u2019s changed is not just the volume but the strategic rationale.\nFor years, the virtual card conversation was about rebates and fraud control. Now, it\u2019s about visibility, traceability and speed, especially in complex trade environments where every delay has downstream impacts.\nUnlike ACH transfers, which often require manual supplier onboarding and can take days to process, virtual cards can be issued instantly, embedded in existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) workflows and settled in near real time. This agility is especially valuable when companies need to pivot suppliers or route goods through new territories in response to trade disruptions.\nEvery new trade restriction amplifies the inefficiencies of paper-based payments.\n\u201cThe really progressive companies are getting in front of [the transition to virtual card],\u201d WEX President of Corporate Payments Eric Frankovic told PYMNTS this month. \u201c\u2026 They have to cut costs, they have to control costs, they have to keep a healthy supply chain. And in order to do that, they have to start those conversations.\u201d\nSee also: Mobile Wallets and Virtual Cards Give B2B Payments Digital Makeover\nEmbedded Finance Meets Strategic Procurement\nAnother force accelerating virtual card adoption is the rise of embedded finance \u2014 the seamless integration of financial services into non-financial platforms. Procurement software, ERP systems and supply chain management tools are increasingly embedding payment capabilities, enabling firms to initiate and reconcile virtual card payments directly from the same interface used to approve purchase orders.\nThe benefits aren\u2019t just operational. Suppliers, particularly small- to medium-sized vendors in emerging markets, often prefer virtual card payments because they settle faster and don\u2019t require maintaining complex banking infrastructures. Some platforms even offer early payment options, allowing suppliers to receive funds within hours in exchange for a small discount \u2014 effectively embedding working capital solutions into the payment rails themselves.\nDespite their appeal, virtual cards are not without challenges. Some suppliers are reluctant to accept card payments due to interchange fees, and integration with legacy accounting systems can be nontrivial. Additionally, card networks\u2019 reach still varies by region and industry.\nStill, the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cBuilding Better B2B Relationships Through Payments Innovation\u201d found that automation, virtual cards and digital payments are becoming cornerstones of B2B payments, with businesses increasingly recognizing their role in strengthening buyer-supplier relationships.\nAs the next round of tariffs looms and supply chains continue to evolve, firms still relying on paper checks may find themselves in a different kind of paper jam \u2014 one that\u2019s entirely self-inflicted.\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter."

Please confirm your email to view all our Trackers.\nLegacy payment methods pose critical challenges for businesses striving to maximize efficiency in an uncertain economic landscape. These challenges take many forms, including payment delays, transaction errors that require correction, and the excessive staffing resources needed to manage paper-based payments.\nSeveral solutions exist to reduce reliance on outdated methods, but few are as promising as business virtual cards. Functioning as digital versions of credit cards, virtual cards can be issued for specific purposes, such as single-use transactions or recurring payments within a set limit. Businesses implementing virtual cards can accelerate payments, strengthen security and automate reconciliation \u2014 especially when used in conjunction with mobile wallets. Additionally, virtual cards often come with financial incentives such as cash-back rewards or rebates, providing an extra boost to a company\u2019s bottom line. By adopting virtual cards, companies can optimize their accounts payable (AP), unlocking efficiencies and gaining better financial visibility to increase cash flow \u2014 all key factors in facilitating growth.\nPaper checks and other outdated payment methods remain prevalent, but their inefficiencies cost businesses valuable time and money. Delays and errors wreak havoc on everyday operations and cash flow.\nCorporates face significant obstacles and inefficiencies with traditional payment systems.\nA recent survey found that nearly 73% of businesses have yet to automate supplier payments, severely limiting their ability to gain a comprehensive view of money movement. The study highlighted substantial challenges with problematic AP processes: 51% of firms reported excessive manual data entry, 47% experienced data errors and process delays, and 23% noted a lack of visibility. These struggles with legacy payment operations prove costly for businesses, underscoring the urgent need for more efficient and automated solutions.\nFinding the optimal mix of payment methods is no easy feat, however. In a recent interview with PYMNTS Intelligence, Eric Frankovic, general manager of corporate payments at WEX, explained that businesses must carefully consider their payment goals, supplier relationships and operational requirements when selecting payment methods. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, there is a clear need to move away from manual payment methods.\nLate payments are a perpetual problem for small businesses.\nIn Q3 2024 (July to September), small businesses experienced an average payment delay of 9.1 days, resulting in a total payment wait time of 28.7 days. This time frame has remained relatively stable since early 2023, fluctuating between 28.5 and 29.5 days. The 9.1-day average delay in Q3 marks an improvement of 0.5 days from the previous quarter, continuing a positive trend of decreasing payment delays that began in April 2024. However, it is worth noting that September itself saw a slight regression, with payment delays slipping to 10.1 days.\nSuch delays often stem from outdated and inefficient payments systems. Small businesses depend on timely payments to manage payroll and supplier obligations, as they lack the cash reserves of larger firms. Upgrading to more advanced payment methods can significantly improve small firms\u2019 financial stability.\nVirtual Cards Offer a Potent Blend of Security, Efficiency and ROI\nVirtual cards bring a powerful combination of security, efficiency and return on investment (ROI) to B2B payments. By adopting them, companies can streamline AP, enhance fraud protection and unlock lucrative supplier rebates \u2014 all driving business growth and improved cash flow.\nCFOs are adding virtual cards to their payment toolkits.\n14%\nof midmarket firms plan to adopt virtual cards within the next year.\nAccording to a recent PYMNTS Intelligence survey, 14% of companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion plan to adopt virtual cards within the next 12 months \u2014 a 322% increase compared to the current adoption level. Interest is particularly strong in the media and technology sector, where 28% plan to use them, and in the fleet and mobility sector, where 26% intend to do so.\nVirtual cards offer myriad advantages over other payment methods, particularly in terms of security and efficiency. By generating unique card numbers for each transaction or vendor, they significantly enhance security and reduce the risk of fraud. For instance, if a supplier\u2019s payment system is compromised, the virtual card used cannot be reused elsewhere, safeguarding business accounts and minimizing financial risks. Additionally, virtual cards streamline payment processes by automating tasks such as invoice reconciliation and payment tracking, saving businesses substantial time and money while reducing errors. Another key benefit of virtual cards is the ability to earn rebates, which are essentially cash back or incentives derived from interchange fees. To fully capitalize on these benefits, businesses must cultivate strong supplier relationships, which are crucial for driving virtual card acceptance and maximizing their value within a company\u2019s overall payment strategy.\nWEX and Conferma teamed up to enable virtual cards for SAP invoice software.\nConferma and WEX have partnered to empower SAP\u2019s Concur Invoice users with the ability to pay suppliers using a WEX-issued virtual Mastercard through Conferma\u2019s virtual card platform. This integration allows commercial customers to make payments instantly while leveraging WEX\u2019s credit terms to manage working capital and extend payment timelines. When a supplier submits an invoice, the solution automatically generates a virtual card for the exact amount within Concur Invoice. The system securely provides pre-authorized payment details to the supplier and automatically reconciles the payment against the invoice. According to the press release, this solution accelerates payments, enhances security, eliminates manual tracking of receipts and invoices, avoids cross-border payment fees, and generates rebate revenue. The integration will be available in all markets and currencies supported by WEX.\nVirtual Cards and Mobile Wallets Are Poised to Transform B2B Transactions\nAs businesses look to optimize their payment methods, they are taking a page from the consumer payments playbook by adopting mobile wallets. Adding virtual cards to mobile digital tools elevates payments to a new level of convenience and control.\nDigital wallets continue to dominate the consumer payments landscape.\nA recent survey found that 82% of merchants plan to expand their adoption of digital wallets, while 70% intend to increase their use of open banking and instant bank transfers \u2014 payment methods that align with increasing consumer demand for convenience and security. According to the study, 60% of merchants cited consumer demand for convenience as the primary driver behind their payments innovation efforts.\n82%\nof businesses plan to increase their use of digital walletsin 2025.\nMobile wallets are making waves in B2B payments.\nInevitably, B2B payments are taking their cue from consumer payment trends in the pursuit of speed and convenience. Offering unprecedented flexibility, mobile wallets deliver significant efficiency improvements by minimizing the administrative workload tied to traditional manual payment methods. This approach not only saves time but also reduces costs related to processing fees, paper checks and data entry errors. Moreover, mobile wallets provide businesses with valuable transaction data. Each digital wallet transaction offers insights into customer spending patterns, preferences and payment habits. These insights empower businesses to make more informed decisions, refine marketing strategies and build stronger customer relationships.\nMobile wallets also improve cash flow management. Companies can gain greater financial control by enabling instant payments and real-time account updates, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively. This is particularly advantageous for small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) that depend on steady cash flow to maintain smooth operations.\nThe Case for Adopting Virtual Cards and Mobile Wallets for B2B Payments\nVirtual credit cards and mobile wallets are revolutionizing B2B payments by offering businesses greater security, efficiency and convenience than legacy payment methods. Each virtual card transaction generates a unique token, protecting sensitive payment information from unauthorized access or fraud. This dynamic security feature eliminates risks associated with static card numbers and centralized databases, which are vulnerable to breaches. Additionally, virtual cards allow businesses to set spending limits, expiration dates and merchant-specific restrictions, providing precise control over expenditures.\nWhen integrated with mobile wallets, virtual cards streamline vendor payments, automate reconciliation and safeguard financial data. Mobile wallets further enhance efficiency by eliminating manual check handling and wire transfers while enabling instant payments. This reduces delays, strengthens supplier relationships and improves cash flow visibility.\nThese solutions integrate seamlessly with AP systems, providing real-time transaction tracking and automated reconciliation. Furthermore, virtual cards embedded in mobile wallets offer detailed reporting, helping businesses optimize expense management and minimize errors. By adopting these tools for B2B payments, companies can enhance operational efficiency, improve financial oversight and meet the growing demand for secure, digital-first transactions.\nAbout\nWEX (NYSE: WEX) is the global commerce platform that simplifies the business of running a business.

      "text": "With the U.S. on Thursday (July 10) threatening additional tariffs of up to 50% on countries like Brazil and materials like copper, the operational migraine that keeping up with each new announcement brings doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon.\nAnd while some businesses are implicitly embracing the TACO (the acronym being used for \u201cTrump always chickens out\u201d) trade and counting on the administration ultimately backing down, the most forward thinking B2B firms are betting on time to cash mastery by treating liquidity not just as a financial metric but as a dynamic business asset.\nTime to cash (T2C) is a strategic framework that reimagines how enterprises manage the end-to-end flow of money \u2014 from invoice issuance to final reconciliation in the bank account. More than a narrow look at days sales outstanding (DSO), T2C spans revenue realization, disbursement strategy, working capital optimization and the underlying technology stack that enables it all.\nFor chief financial officers (CFOs), that means moving beyond static cash flow reports toward a more real-time, predictive and action-oriented model. Time to cash isn\u2019t just a reporting concern; it\u2019s becoming a core strategic differentiator. Companies that can both accelerate inflows and intelligently manage outflows may be able to enjoy a material advantage in volatility by reinvesting faster, borrowing less and pivoting with precision.\nRead more: How B2B Payments Data Turns Customer Retention Into a Growth Strategy\nThe CFO as Ecosystem Architect\nTime to cash is not new\u2014it\u2019s the cousin of \u201corder to cash\u201d (O2C), a well-established supply chain and finance process. But what\u2019s different today is how holistic and strategic it\u2019s become. Time to cash now encompasses lead qualification, contracting, fulfillment, invoicing, collections and even embedded finance. Every department, from marketing to customer success, is being evaluated on its ability to reduce friction and latency.\n\u201cHow long is the invoice in the building?\u201d Edenred Pay CFO Joe Denson told PYMNTS during a discussion about payables automation. \u201cIdeally, you\u2019re measuring handling time in minutes, not days. How many people are involved? Fewer is better, as long as separation of duties and controls are preserved. And can I get the data in a way that\u2019s sortable and manageable? \u2026 AP automation allows finance staff to stop doing manual tasks like entering invoices or looking up suppliers.\u201d\nTo help with identifying where businesses sit currently, Visa and PYMNTS Intelligence created a dynamic benchmarking report that can help users take a deeper look into how their DPO (days payable outstanding) and other metrics stack up against peers and outperformers within their chosen industries.\nThe sales-to-cash cycle remains an operational blind spot in many organizations. But finance teams are beginning to assert more control by partnering with sales, credit and collections to streamline invoicing, reduce disputes and better segment customers by risk profile.\nAutomation also plays a key role here. Intelligent accounts receivable (AR) systems can tailor outreach based on customer behavior, apply payments at the invoice level and trigger dynamic collections workflows. When orchestrated well, revenue realization becomes a repeatable engine, not a firefighting exercise.\nSee also: For CFOs, the Tech Stack Is the Business Strategy\nLiquidity Becomes a Competitive Weapon\nTechnology alone doesn\u2019t drive velocity. What distinguishes high-performing firms is a cash-first culture. One that embeds liquidity awareness into daily operations across sales, procurement and operations.\nIn these organizations, cash conversion is a shared KPI. Deal desk terms are evaluated for DSO impact. Procurement teams balance cost and payment terms in tandem. Inventory is managed with liquidity, not just logistics, in mind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change going on, and it all centers around working capital,\u201d David Bork, senior vice president, Boost 100 Business Development at Boost Payment Solutions, told PYMNTS.\nStill, PYMNTS Intelligence data has found that tariffs and other supply chain disruptions have forced most middle-market U.S. goods and retail companies into reactive mode. This can result in payments staying stuck in last century, with paper checks and manual data entry still common elements of accounts receivable.\nPYNTS Intelligence has also found that when it comes to cash flow, security and convenience, virtual cards offer AP and AR departments a suite of advantages. At the end of the day, B2B companies want a simple, secure, consumer-like digital payments experience, Greg Castro, president of PayTrace by North, writes in a new PYMNTS eBook, \u201cHalftime 2025: Charting the Future of Payments.\u201d"

      "text": "Yet in B2B, money has always moved slowly, sometimes painfully so. For decades, corporate procurement and supplier payments were governed by entrenched terms, often designed to tilt the advantage toward one party.\nThe buyer sought to conserve cash; the supplier sought to get paid as quickly as possible. Between them lay a battlefield of net-30, net-60 or even net-90 payment terms, late fees and financing workarounds.\nToday, that battlefield is transforming into something more like a negotiation table. Under the combined weight of ongoing tariff-driven uncertainty, macroeconomic disruptions and cash flow volatility, B2B suppliers and buyers are taking a fresh look at the rules of engagement.\nThis renewed attention on accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) points to a new era of trust-building in B2B payments may be emerging, powered by technology, alternative financing tools and an openness to collaboration.\nRead more: B2B Firms Are Betting on Time to Cash to Manage Uncertainty\nEmbracing Fairness as a B2B Payments Strategy\nFor much of the last half-century, corporate buyers dictated terms. Large retailers might stretch payments to suppliers for 90 or even 120 days to optimize their own working capital, leaving smaller vendors scrambling to finance operations.\nBut the pandemic, global shipping crises and ongoing U.S. tariff escalations have rewritten the script. The once-invisible payment friction became a strategic vulnerability. Delayed payments cascaded into disrupted supply, exposing buyers to inventory shortages and reputational damage. For suppliers, uncertainty about cash inflows made it harder to secure raw materials or invest in production capacity.\nPYMNTS Intelligence in the June CAIO Report, \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d found that 60% of firms reported that they are addressing today\u2019s tariff-induced challenges through tighter partner coordination, smarter sourcing contract terms, more dynamic price modeling and greater alignment between finance and procurement functions.\nAt the same time, \u201cThe 2024-2025 Growth Corporates Working Capital Index,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report commissioned by Visa, found that the integration of suppliers\u2014through digital means, as their billing systems are linked to the buyers\u2019 payment operations\u2014can improve cash flow for both parties, and by extension, create B2B ecosystems that are efficient.\nVirtual card platforms are also being adapted for B2B trade. By issuing single-use cards with pre-approved amounts and automatic reconciliation, companies can guarantee payment upon delivery while maintaining tight spend controls.\nOn Wednesday (Aug. 13), Visa and B2B payment orchestration platform Bluechain, for example, partnered to enable digital transformation of B2B payments in the U.K.\nSee also: How Synthetic Data Is Becoming B2B CFOs\u2019 Secret Weapon\nTechnology Is Being Integrated Into B2B Workflows\nThe trust-building era in B2B isn\u2019t just a mindset change; it\u2019s also being engineered into the payment process itself. Cloud-based procurement platforms now integrate payment scheduling, financing options and tariff tracking in real time. Both buyer and supplier can see where money is, when it will arrive and how external cost factors might change the plan.\nThis transparency is a departure from legacy systems, where payment status was opaque and disputes were resolved by phone or email chains.\nOf course, the move toward mutual benefit doesn\u2019t eliminate risk, and there\u2019s also the challenge of ensuring digital tools integrate cleanly with enterprise resource planning systems and comply with local regulations.\nAccording to \u201cVirtual Mobility: How Mobile Virtual Cards Elevate B2B Payments,\u201d done in collaboration with WEX, almost 73% of businesses have yet to automate supplier payments, significantly limiting their ability to gain a comprehensive view of money movement.\nStill, the alternative of clinging to adversarial terms in a fragile supply chain may carry greater long-term risk. As tariffs, geopolitical shocks and environmental disruptions become more common, the ability to flex payment terms quickly could prove to be a competitive advantage.\n\u201cA one-size-fits-all framework can miss the actual risks in a relationship,\u201d Boost Payment Solutions Chief Compliance Officer Elly Aiala told PYMNTS.\nThe B2B trust-building trend may only continue to accelerate as generative AI and predictive analytics enhance B2B payment platforms.\nIn this vision, payment terms cease to be static clauses and become living agreements that adapt in real time to economic signals. That adaptability could turn payment practices from a source of friction into a driver of resilience."

The new rates include a 5-cent increase in the price of a First-Class Mail Forever stamp from 73 cents to 78 cents.\nThe proposed adjustments, approved by the governors of the Postal Service, would raise mailing services product prices approximately 7.4 percent. If favorably reviewed by the commission, the price changes would include:\nProduct |\nCurrent prices |\nPlanned prices |\n|---|---|---|\nLetters (1 ounce) |\n73 cents |\n78 cents |\nLetters (metered 1 ounce) |\n69 cents |\n74 cents |\nDomestic postcards |\n56 cents |\n61 cents* |\nInternational postcards |\n$1.65 |\n$1.70 |\nInternational letter (1 ounce) |\n$1.65 |\n$1.70 |\nThe additional-ounce price for single-piece letters will increase from 28 cents to 29 cents. The Postal Service is also seeking price adjustments for the Special Services products. Notably, the Postal Service will apply a price reduction of 12 percent for postal insurance when mailing an item.\nAs changes in the mailing and shipping marketplace continue, these price adjustments are needed to achieve the financial stability sought by the organization\u2019s Delivering for America 10-year plan. USPS prices remain among the most affordable in the world.\nFollowing a directive from the PRC, the Postal Service is filing two sets of prices for Marketing Mail and Package Services products. While only one set of rates will go into effect on July 13, these prices address the pending proposal to eliminate Bound Printed Matter and expand Marketing Mail, pending the commission\u2019s approval. USPS will release additional communications to address price changes in these categories.\nThe PRC will review the changes before they are scheduled to take effect. The complete Postal Service price filing, with prices for all products, can be found on the commission\u2019s website under the Daily Listings section. The Mailing Services filing is Docket No. R2025-1. The price tables are also available on the Postal Service\u2019s Postal Explorer website at pe.usps.com/PriceChange/Index.\n*The 61 cents price is revised from the previously announced 62 cents, reflecting prices approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission.\nPostal Products\nCustomers may purchase stamps and other philatelic products through the Postal Store at usps.com/shopstamps, by calling 844-737-7826, by mail through USA Philatelic or at Post Office locations nationwide.

      "text": "As Trump pushes for changes, U.S. Postal Service struggles to deliver the mail on time\nDelivery time for first-class mail has slipped, even with lower standards, report finds.\nThe U.S. Postal Service continues struggling to deliver mail on time, with delivery times for first-class letters slipping by 5% over the past two years, according to a new internal review.\nThe report by the USPS Inspector General found that delivery times are slowing even though the service has repeatedly given itself more time to deliver that mail. The postal service has struggled for years to meet its goals, in part because its leaders have said Congress micromanages how the it operates.\nBut in a time when Amazon customers can track their packages second-by-second, the inspector general warned that continued mail delays may prompt postal customers to seek alternatives, further exacerbating the financial challenges. The IG report also noted that the postal service needs to do a better job stopping its bulk-mailing clients from sending too-thick mailers that clog up automated sorting machines.\nThe postal service in 2021 launched a 10-year transformation dubbed \"Delivering for America\" aimed at cutting costs and giving more attention to package delivery, which can be more profitable.\n\"...it appears the Postal Service\u2019s network will be in a transitional state for an undetermined number of years,\" the IG report concluded. \"Despite massive network changes aimed at cutting costs and improving service, along with various price increases to support DFA, service levels remain inconsistent and financial stability has not yet been achieved.\"\nPresident Donald Trump has floated making significant changes to how the postal service operates, and officials have called in Elon Musk's DOGE team to help stem financial losses that hit $9.5 billion last year.\nUnion representatives and other postal service boosters say Congress has put the service in an impossible position, and that making money shouldn't be the goal.\nThe postal service has a current goal of delivering first-class mail on time 88% of the time, significantly lower than its goal of 92.5% in 2023. Part of the challenge, the inspector general reported, is that the postal service is delivering 80% fewer pieces like personal letters or bills today compared to the late 1990s, but hasn't adequately adjusted its delivery system.\nThe IG report also noted the postal service struggles with misprocessing mail, in one case finding that a test package sent from Anaheim, California, to Denver inexplicably first detoured to two processing sites in Florida, delaying delivery by three days. In another case, a package sent from Tucson to Denver detoured through Wyoming and Utah \u2012 after first arriving Denver \u2012 delaying delivery by five days.\nPriority mail deliveries have also slipped, although that data was kept confidential because the Postal Service competes with FedEx and UPS, among others, on that kind of delivery.\nTrump has suggested merging the independent postal service with the Department of Commerce, which would require Congressional approval. Former Postmaster General Louis Dejoy stepped down earlier this year, and is being replaced by FedEx board member and former Waste Management CEO David Steiner. Steiner is currently undergoing mandatory background checks and is expected to formally assume the post in July.\nDejoy brought in Elon Musk's DOGE team to help the service cut costs and improve efficiency as it delivers mail to 165 million addresses six times a week. That move drew nationwide protests in support of the American Postal Workers Union, which has noted public sentiment overwhelmingly opposes significant cuts.\nLast year, the service handled more than 116 billion pieces of mail, with most of that being presorted mailers, solicitations or other items that many people would consider \"junk\" mail. Overall mail volumes have been dropping since 2006, according to the postal service, but each year there are more and more addresses to deliver to.\nPrivate companies like FedEx and UPS are outcompeting the postal service for some parcel deliveries, in part because it's a lot easier for them to charge higher prices for harder deliveries in rural area \u2012 or to simply not deliver. Some of the changes underway at the postal service aim to better position it to compete for those deliveries, where profits can be higher.\nCongress mandates that the postal service deliver affordably priced first-class mail to virtually every address in the country, regardless of how much it costs to do so. That's why it still uses mules or horses to deliver to Supai, Arizona, a remote Havasupai tribal village in the Grand Canyon of Arizona, or float planes to serve fishing villages off the Alaska coast.\nLongtime postal service critic and now-retired New York University Prof. Steve Hutkins said the inspector general report makes it clear the service has a tough job ahead.\n\"The idea has been that at least they'd be able to achieve their targets with the lower standards, but the IG is suggesting things aren't going to get better for a long time,\" he said.\nThe postal service declined to answer questions from USA TODAY about the report, instead referring to written comments it made to the inspector general.\n\"While service is not where it needs to be today, the changes are necessary to ensure the long-term operational improvements and financial condition improvements of the USPS well into the future,\" postal service managers wrote in response to the IG's report."

Still, even Rolfson said that \u201cchecks are going to continue to die the slowest death.\u201d\nSo why is it that business payments are taking so long to go fully electronic?\nAfter all, the manual nature of paper checks introduces a higher risk of errors that can damage relationships with vendors, suppliers and even employees. Not only that, but their physical characteristics are an attractive attack vector for fraudsters, and they can be easily lost or stolen in transit.\nBeyond that, ongoing shifts in commercial customer expectations have introduced widening opportunity costs for businesses that exclusively rely on paper checks; and the repetitive administrative processes necessary to send and receive them ties up valuable employee time that could \u2014 and should \u2014 be better spent on more strategic initiatives.\n\u201cThe typical in-house AR program runs the same way it has for the last 20 or 30 years, same tools, same processes, sometimes even the same people,\u201d Ben Lamm, chief operating officer at Capital One Trade Credit, told PYMNTS. \u201cIt\u2019s an outdated legacy program. It\u2019s manual and clunky, not just for the merchant, but also for their customers.\u201d\nGet the research: Can Automating Working Capital Insulate Businesses From an Economic Downturn?\nDigital solutions powered by modern innovations can solve for the challenges and frictions inherent to paper checks, while boosting operational effectiveness and workflow efficiency. But in order to take the next step, businesses need to first recognize that there might be a problem.\n\u201cPeople are not saying, \u2018Our biggest problem is paper checks\u2019 \u2014 that is not currently in the debate\u2026 The general managers, decision makers, these folks are usually within a few years of their retirement, and they don\u2019t want a lot of change because they want to finish out and let somebody else take on the next effort,\u201d Jake Joraanstad, CEO at Bushel, told PYMNTS.\n\u201cTreasury operations historically have been bogged down with manual processes, but are often the last to get investment dollars for new software automation,\u201d Krista Sharp, co-head of Treasury Services for Middle Market Banking and Specialized Industries at J.P. Morgan Chase, told PYMNTS.\nInnovate or Stagnate\nPYMNTS Intelligence finds that 64% of CFOs say they \u201cdefinitely need\u201d more automation for their AR processes.\nThat\u2019s because embracing technological advancements not only reduces costs but also positions businesses to thrive in an increasingly digital and competitive world.\n\u201cThe amount of paper that is still passed around in the B2B space continues to stun me, and it\u2019s somewhat by choice, but more and more, I think businesses are looking for a better way,\u201d Shawn Cunningham, managing vice president and head of Capital One Trade Credit, told PYMNTS.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a supplier and you\u2019re not making it easy for a B2B customer to do business with you, then you are not meeting their needs \u2026 and you are putting relationships at risk,\u201d Cunningham said.\nAnd the needs, as well as the savings, go both ways. Paper checks bog down employees, while automated solutions free up their time to focus on more important objectives.\n\u201cThere are two ways to monetize [digital payments], which is efficiency of the finance teams, and then actually efficiency of the payments itself,\u201d Karandeep Anand, chief product officer at Brex, told PYMNTS. \u201cIf you can even save some eight- or 10-people\u2019s worth of work at the end of the quarter and finish and close the books within 24 to 48 hours, that is priceless.\u201d\nIt is a story PYMNTS has heard repeatedly. Let\u2019s hope it has a happy ending for today\u2019s businesses."

      "text": "Banks say they fear fraud on real-time payment rails. The numbers say they shouldn\u2019t.\nThe August 2025 report, \u201cFact vs. Fiction in Real-Time Payments Fraud,\u201d published by PYMNTS Intelligence and The Clearing House, gives rise to a striking contradiction: financial institutions are disproportionately worried about fraud risks in real-time payments, even as those same rails show the lowest fraud rates in the industry.\nFraud Concerns and Receive-Only Mode\nThat fear is shaping decisions at the infrastructure level. According to the report, 78% of organizations choose to start their real-time implementation in receive-only mode, a risk-avoidance strategy that limits the value of faster payments and stalls ecosystem-wide adoption.\nBut the data undermines the fear. Fraud is happening, but not where banks expect it.\nThe headline findings from the report are familiar. Real-time payments are gaining ground, but adoption is hindered by persistent myths. The RTP network and FedNow Service, the two primary real-time rails in the U.S., are designed with built-in fraud mitigation tools \u2014 yet only 22% of banks have embraced full send-and-receive functionality.\nThe report makes the case that security fears are less a reflection of actual threats and more a legacy mindset carried over from fraud-prone systems like checks and wires.\nWhat\u2019s buried beneath the top-line summary, however, is this:\n- Just 2% of firms reported any fraud on RTP or FedNow. In contrast, a staggering 63% of firms reported check fraud in 2024, while ACH and wire transfers saw fraud rates of 38% and 30%, respectively.\n- Only 3% of financial institutions characterized real-time fraud as \u201csignificant.\u201d Most categorized the fraud impact as either \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cslight\u201d\u2014and a large portion reported no impact at all.\n- Despite these numbers, 85% of U.S. payment professionals still expect fraud to rise with real-time payments. Among large institutions (50,000+ employees), that expectation climbs to 95%, with half anticipating a sharp increase.\nThe discrepancy isn\u2019t just academic. It has market consequences. Institutions are over-indexing on risk and under-leveraging one of the industry\u2019s most secure payment systems. The irony is stark: checks remain in use by 75% of firms despite being the most fraud-prone instrument.\nMeanwhile, real-time systems \u2014 designed with push-only architecture, API-level security, and instant transaction visibility \u2014 are still eyed with suspicion.\nPart of the problem may be optics. Fraud that does occur on real-time rails \u2014 such as authorized push payment (APP) scams \u2014 tends to make headlines, while the day-to-day security wins go unnoticed. Still, tools like Confirmation of Payee (CoP) have near-universal support (96% of banks) and have already cut fraud 60% in the U.K. market. In the U.S., however, partial adoption risks rerouting fraud to less protected institutions.\nMaking the Case for Real Time\nOther findings in the report further reinforce the case for real-time rails. The Clearing House and the Fed continue to expand fraud defenses with tools like real-time monitoring, collaborative data exchange, and scam classification models. Banks themselves are prioritizing AI, multifactor authentication, and interbank data sharing to further reduce risk. Yet without broader adoption, those efforts risk being underutilized.\nThe path forward doesn\u2019t require new tech; it requires a mindset shift. The report offers ample evidence that the real-time rails are ready. Now it\u2019s time for institutions to catch up."

In addition, PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s research finds significant improvements in working capital efficiency among Growth Corporates in 2024. This efficiency gain is largely attributed to better cash visibility and optimized use of working capital solutions.\nThe preference for on-demand solutions, such as corporate and virtual cards and bank lines of credit, has surged. This is especially evident in regions and industries with high operational efficiency. However, challenges in accessing these solutions persist. The impacts are particularly felt among firms in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) and in industries like commercial travel and media and technology, where slow approvals and suboptimal options are prevalent.\nThe most efficient Growth Corporates \u2014 which we labeled top performers \u2014 leveraged flexible and strategic working capital solutions. As a result, they achieved 51% shorter cash conversion cycles.

Please confirm your email to view all our Trackers.\nFaster payments are gaining traction, but fraud fears haven\u2019t kept pace with facts. Convinced that speed invites scams, many banks in the United States remain hesitant about fully embracing real-time rails such as the RTP\u00ae network and the FedNow\u00ae Service. This fear persists\u2014even though it\u2019s outdated. Today\u2019s instant rails offer stronger fraud defenses than checks, wires or automated clearing house (ACH). Still, stubborn myths about payment speed and its attendant risks shape how financial institutions (FIs) act. Too many try to \u201cplay it safe\u201d by offering receive-only service, bottlenecking adoption and limiting faster payments\u2019 value. It\u2019s time for a reset. Clearing up misperceptions could unlock real-time payments\u2019 broader benefits\u2014from better customer experience to lower fraud exposure.\nFraud Fears Still Hamper Real-Time Payments Adoption\nFear of fraud remains one of the biggest hurdles to real-time payments adoption. Many banks limit participation to receive-only mode, driven by concerns that speed increases exposure to scams and fraud risk.\nBanks\u2019 fear of fraud in instant payments is widespread\u2014and growing.\nFraud remains a central fear restricting real-time payments adoption at scale. In a recent study by RedCompass Labs, 85% of U.S. payment professionals said they expect fraud to increase as instant payments become more common. Larger banks, worried about being bigger targets, are the most on edge. Ninety-five percent of firms with more than 50,000 employees expect fraud to rise, and half predict a sharp increase, according to the same findings.\n85%\nof U.S. payment professionals expect more fraud as instant payments scale.\nIn fact, fraud\u2019s ranking as a hurdle to real-time rails adoption saw the biggest increase this year, climbing to fourth place from ninth in 2024, though this was still relatively low, cited by 26% of FIs. Of all the named obstacles to instant payments implementation, fraud followed fierce competition from FinTechs at number one (36%), the challenge of needing to offer 24/7 availability at number two (34%), and the difficulty of updating architecture and internal systems at number three (28%). Researchers noted that the rise of fraud concerns as a barrier makes sense as banks come to grips with the actual operation of instant payments after focusing almost exclusively on structural challenges until now.\nAmid rising financial fraud, robust protection is essential.\nThe 2025 Faster Payments Barometer found that the specific fraud fears surrounding real-time payments adoption mirror those in the financial industry at large. At 35%, account takeover fraud ranks as the top worry regarding instant payments, followed closely by authorized push payment (APP) fraud, such as scams that trick users into sending money, at 30%. Other risks\u2014including synthetic identity and invoice fraud\u2014draw more moderate urgency (10% to 15%). Meanwhile, so-called money mule activity\u2014when fraudsters use individuals to transfer stolen funds\u2014occupies a lower yet still significant tier of concern, at less than 5%.\nThese apprehensions suggest that FIs should prioritize authentication and customer education to address both the technical and the human weaknesses that fraudsters exploit. However, many institutions are taking the less rational approach of forgoing adoption altogether.\nOpting out of instant payments serves no one.\nFears tied to authorized sender fraud\u2014especially on platforms like Zelle, where it has drawn regulators\u2019 attention\u2014are shaping real-world choices, with many banks adopting receive-only functionality to reduce exposure. According to the 2025 Faster Payments Barometer, 78% of all surveyed organizations planned to begin their implementations with receive-only capabilities, whereas just 22% intended to launch full send-and-receive services.\nThe assumption behind these decisions? \u201cFaster payments equal faster fraud.\u201d That myth still shapes how institutions act, even as today\u2019s rails tell a different story. FIs that limit engagement due to a lack of confidence in their defenses only create a bottleneck that constricts adoption across the banking ecosystem.\nFraud on the RTP\u00ae Network and FedNow\u00ae Remains Rare\nDespite these anxieties, current fraud rates on faster payment rails are significantly lower than for traditional payment systems. Real-time transactions face less fraud than checks, wires or ACH\u2014yet many institutions still view them as riskier.\nLegacy rails face higher fraud risk than real-time payments.\n63%\nof firms report check fraud. Just 2% report fraud on RTP or FedNow.\nFraud on traditional rails still exceeds real-time payments fraud by a wide margin. According to the 2025 Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) Payments Fraud and Control Survey Report, 63% of firms reported attempted or actual check fraud in 2024, compared to just 2% on RTP or FedNow. According to The Clearing House (TCH), fraud rates on the RTP network are a fraction of a percentage point. In April 2025, for example, out of 35 million transactions, there were just 123 instances of reported fraud. Meanwhile, ACH debits and wire transfers took second and third place in actual or attempted fraud, at 38% and 30%, respectively.\nThose findings reflect how fraudsters target older systems that move high volumes while lacking modern safeguards. Real-time networks, by contrast, often run in tokenized API environments that improve transaction security and access control. Real-time payments networks allow only push payments, where the account holder must send the transaction. This is unlike other payment types, such as ACH, where pull (debit) payments are allowed.\nChecks still dominate payments despite high fraud exposure.\nChecks remain widely used, despite persistent fraud risks. Although nearly two in three institutions experienced check fraud in 2024 and nearly one in four incidents involved stolen mail, 75% of firms still plan to keep using checks over the next two years. Instant payments are often better protected, but that advantage still hasn\u2019t revolutionized institutional behavior.\nMeanwhile, the government is taking action against the tidal wave of check fraud. The U.S. Treasury and banking groups are fast-tracking the digitization of federal checks per an executive order ahead of a September deadline. This move, which specifically recommends real-time payments as a safer alternative, is a crucial step in the government\u2019s broader efforts to safeguard federal payments against fraud.\n\u201cRemoving paper Treasury checks from circulation is an important step toward reducing theft and the related losses,\u201d top banking associations said in a recent joint letter to the Treasury regarding the order.\nMost fraud cases tied to RTP and FedNow are low-impact.\nMoreover, the severity of fraud\u2019s impact on faster payments is often limited. According to the Faster Payments Barometer, just 3% of financial institutions report real-time payments\u2019 fraud impact as \u201csignificant.\u201d Most incidents are categorized as \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cmoderate,\u201d and a large portion of FIs report zero impact. These findings suggest that current controls are working, though sustained investment is still needed to stay ahead of evolving threats.\nFraud Prevention Tools Win Bank Support\nFinancial institutions must raise awareness of real-time payments\u2019 strong fraud prevention tools to encourage broader adoption. Many FIs already support advanced solutions\u2014and U.S. real-time rails are fully on board, launching their own initiatives.\nBanks back stronger fraud defenses\u2014but broader adoption is needed for them to work.\nMany institutions back targeted tools to contain fraud. For example, nearly all banks, at 96%, support introducing an ID verification system like Confirmation of Payee (CoP). The principle is simple: Before processing a transaction, the recipient\u2019s details are matched against the sender\u2019s entered information, with the sender then notified of any discrepancy. Among small to mid-sized banks, support rises to 97%.\nSuch a system has already proven effective at combating APP fraud in the United Kingdom, where its mandate has resulted in a 60% reduction in fraud cases. However, for tools like CoP to work, bank participation must be near-universal. The concern is that partial adoption of this tool, as in the fragmented U.S. real-time payments market, would simply reroute fraud to banks that are not covered.\nThe top five tools banks say they need.\nRedCompass Labs asked U.S. banks which fraud prevention measures they consider most urgent. Leading the list: artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) (40%), followed by real-time detection (39%) and multifactor authentication (MFA) (35%). Data sharing among banks (32%) and coordination with telecom and tech firms (27%) round out the top five.\nAll five strategies aim to stop fraud before funds move. Confidence is growing in technology\u2019s potential to achieve just that, with 54% of U.S. big banks this year believing AI can improve financial crime detection, up from only 31% overall last year.\nTCH and the Fed step up fraud defense.\nBanks that participate in the major U.S. real-time networks, meanwhile, will find these rails\u2019 defenses already robust and gaining strength. The Clearing House and the Federal Reserve have each launched new fraud mitigation tools for the RTP network and FedNow, respectively. These include real-time monitoring, collaborative data exchange and the Fed\u2019s ScamClassifier model\u2014a framework for tracking scam types and patterns. These efforts matter. With the measures\u2019 continued success fueling more bank participation, the U.S. could quickly become a leader in the real-time payments race.\nTurning the Page on Faster Payments Myths\nEven as fraud rates remain low, persistent myths about risk are slowing real-time payments adoption. To move forward, stakeholders must confront the perception gap, equipping institutions and consumers alike with the tools and clarity needed to build trust at scale.\nFraud is still a top concern\u2014but not the top threat. Just 2% of firms report fraud on real-time rails, versus 63% on checks.\nRisk is concentrated, not constant. Account takeover and push payment scams top the threat list, yet most fraud events have limited impact on faster payment rails.\nCoP-style ID checks have near-universal support. Ninety-six percent of banks want them\u2014but coverage must be consistent to close gaps.\nTechnology works best when paired with collaboration. Banks rank AI, MFA and real-time monitoring highly\u2014but also want stronger data sharing.\nNetwork operators are stepping up. RTP and FedNow are expanding real-time defenses and scam-tracking frameworks.\nReal-time payments have reached an inflection point. While risk won\u2019t disappear entirely anytime soon, the tools to manage it are mature, tested and widely endorsed. Widespread instant payments adoption now depends on better communication, smarter coordination and closing the trust gap.\nAbout\nThe Clearing House operates U.S.-based payments networks that clear and settle funds through ACH, check image, the RTP\u00ae network and wire transfers.

      "text": "Picture this: a treasury office in 2035. The morning might start with a chief financial officer logging into a secure portal, where an artificial intelligence (AI) avatar greets them with a briefing of overnight currency swings, projected cash balances, and maybe an alert about a supplier default risk in Asia.\nThe AI, against this backdrop, could propose a handful of mitigation strategies, complete with financial impacts and probabilities. The CFO might ask follow-up questions, challenge assumptions, and ultimately greenlights one path. The avatar would then execute, documenting rationale for auditors. Minutes later, the company\u2019s global liquidity profile is adjusted.\nThis is not science fiction. The core technologies of large language models, autonomous agents, and conversational avatars all exist today. What remains is integration, governance, and cultural acceptance.\nAfter all, 2035 is just 10 years away.\nThe AI treasurer is coming; the question is when, not if. And the potential of agentic AI in corporate treasury underscores a broader truth, that finance is no longer confined to numbers in a ledger. It is increasingly about speed, foresight and trust.\nRead more: Treasurers Step Into Strategy Room as Scenario Planning Becomes Corporate Weapon\nFrom Back Office to Center Stage\nCorporate treasury has historically been considered a niche discipline, tucked behind flashier functions like strategy or product innovation. Yet it often determines whether a business can survive shocks. During the 2008 financial crisis, treasury teams scrambled daily to secure funding. During the pandemic, they became lifelines, navigating frozen supply chains and unpredictable demand curves.\nThese historic crucibles have elevated treasury\u2019s strategic importance. Boards now expect treasurers to provide real-time insight, not just static reports. But human teams are limited: even a well-staffed treasury department cannot scan thousands of market signals, liquidity positions and geopolitical shifts in real time without help. Spreadsheets and enterprise systems only go so far.\nThis is where agentic AI treasury systems could enter. Rather than functioning as silent engines behind a dashboard, next-generation AI treasurers may appear as interactive, explainable agents. They can tell a CFO why a swap was executed, walk through alternative scenarios, and even adjust tone and detail depending on the audience, whether it\u2019s a risk committee or a junior analyst. The once-invisible treasury function suddenly becomes a visible, conversational partner.\nAnimated, conversational, and capable of executing trades or wiring funds, these agentic AI systems could fundamentally reshape how corporations think about liquidity, risk and decision-making.\nSee also: Payments Execs Say AI Agents Give Payments an Autonomous Overhaul\nThe Avatar Advantage\nThe idea of an \u201cAI avatar\u201d may conjure images of cartoonish holograms. But in the finance context, the avatar is less about theatrics and more about human trust. Avatars serve as the interface for increasingly complex decision-making systems. When an algorithm moves $200 million across jurisdictions, executives want to know not only what happened but why. A face, realistic or stylized, can become a conduit for explainability.\nImagine a treasury meeting where the AI treasurer presents cash forecasts, highlighting potential liquidity shortfalls two quarters out. The avatar explains that a pattern in supplier payments and foreign exchange exposures points to risk. When asked why the system recommends hedging euro-denominated receivables, the avatar cites real-time volatility metrics, historical correlations, stress tests, then executes the hedge instantly once approved.\nFindings in the July Digital Financial Services Tracker\u00ae Series report, \u201cAI Power: The Technology Transforming Accounts Receivable,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence collaboration with FIS, revealed that AI is transforming AR from a reactive, transactional function into a proactive, relationship-centered discipline, all while becoming the software engine powering the next generation of smarter financial performance.\nOf course, handing over the corporate wallet to an AI is fraught with risk. Treasury errors are unforgiving, and agentic AI systems must therefore be bound by strict governance.\nExplainability is another cornerstone. Unlike traditional algorithms, which often operate as black boxes, avatars can narrate reasoning in real time. For treasury professionals, that matters. They don\u2019t simply need answers; they need defensible justifications for auditors, regulators and boards. A system that can explain why it took \u2014 or refrained from taking \u2014 action becomes not just a tool but a partner.\nNot all companies move at the same pace. Highly regulated sectors like banking and healthcare will likely adopt cautiously, layering AI avatars atop existing systems as decision-support tools rather than autonomous actors. Tech-forward firms, meanwhile, may experiment more aggressively, betting that early adoption of AI treasurers can deliver a competitive edge in capital efficiency.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cSmart Spending: How AI Is Transforming Financial Decision Making\u201d found that more than 8 in 10 CFOs at large companies are either already using AI or considering adopting it, while financial institutions like Bank of America are betting heavily on treasury data intelligence platforms, which promise real-time insights and predictive analytics.\nBy giving algorithms a face and a voice, companies can bridge the gap between machine precision and human comprehension. Done right, AI treasurers will not replace humans but extend them by enabling treasury teams to act with unprecedented agility in a world where every signal matters.\nRead more: Why Trust Is Data\u2019s Only Real Currency"

      "text": "Walk into the back office of a company with an alleged cutting-edge accounts payable (AP) function, and you might expect to see a frictionless, fully digital operation.\nInstead, what you\u2019ll often find looks more like a throwback to the 1990s, with finance teams performing swivel chair maneuvers: Employees swivel between screens, systems, and sometimes literal office equipment to finish the job.\n\u201cYou go log into a bank portal or another system, or in some cases quite literally hitting print and going over the printer, grabbing checks off the printer and stuffing them in envelopes,\u201d Chris Wyatt, chief strategy officer at Finexio, told PYMNTS.\nThis tension between digitization on one side and manual payment execution on the other has become one of the great contradictions of modern corporate finance. Despite billions of dollars invested in digitization over the past two decades, the final mile of B2B payments remains clunky, siloed and risky. And for CFOs now under relentless pressure to \u201cdo more with less,\u201d that contradiction has become impossible to ignore.\nAfter all, as Wyatt noted, the consumerization of financial services has recalibrated expectations. If corporate leaders can make a frictionless payment for a morning coffee or split a rideshare with a tap, why shouldn\u2019t AP teams expect the same fluidity at work?\nWyatt compared it to navigation: \u201cIt would be like saying, hey, is having GPS a nice to have, or is it essential? Most people would say today it\u2019s essential. Sure, you could go back to having a map, but why, when you\u2019ve got all these nice tools available?\u201d\nThe industry\u2019s response has been the emergence of integrated payables: platforms that embed payment execution directly into the AP workflow. These systems allow users to approve invoices and trigger payments from the same dashboard, often supporting multiple payment methods.\nRise of Integrated Payables\nThe result of embedded B2B solutions is a growing shift in mindset across the AP function and office of the CFO. Control over timing can preserve cash in downturns. Rich payment data can reveal supplier risks, and efficient execution can free finance staff for higher-value work.\n\u201cWe always like to stress cost avoidance,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThink about those manual repetitive tasks that are expensive for your team. Ideally, it\u2019s probably not what you hired your team to do.\u201d\nIf eliminating complexity were the only benefit, embedded payments would already be a strong business case. But Wyatt highlighted an even more compelling upside: turning AP from a cost center into a profit center.\n\u201cFor virtual card, think cash back,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s so ubiquitous in the consumer realm. It\u2019s highly underutilized in the B2B space. You can potentially take what was an AP cost center and turn it into a profit center.\u201d\nThe broader opportunity, he added, lies in empowering buyers. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the money, they\u2019re making the purchasing decisions, and suppliers are often willing to negotiate. OK, I\u2019ll take a card today versus waiting 90 days for a check.\u201d\nWhat emerges is a vision of AP as a strategic growth lever, not just a back-office function.\nBack End Matters More Than the Front\nAt the same time, while one major barrier to adoption remains the question of integration, fears of complexity and resource sink are becoming outdated. Finance leaders often ask providers: Do you integrate with ERP X, Y or Z? But Wyatt stressed the real challenge isn\u2019t simply checking boxes but about flexibility.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re really asking when they say integrate. APIs, passing files. There\u2019s any number of ways to integrate. Ultimately, it\u2019s like, what does that user experience look like? More importantly, I really think the goal should be more about having this flexible sort of payment fabric that can ideally connect almost any system,\u201d he said.\nWyatt likened it to a universal power adapter: \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to worry what country you\u2019re in. You just know it\u2019s got what you need.\u201d\nThe right approach, therefore, is less about point-to-point connections and more about creating an \u201ceasy button\u201d that simplifies complexity for AP teams, ensuring payments flow seamlessly regardless of the underlying system.\n\u201cFor the most part, the front end, that\u2019s the user experience and that\u2019s great. But ideally, if you\u2019re really going to help these AP teams save time, energy, money, resources, let them do something better,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThe back-end service has to really do all the heavy lifting.\u201d\nThat means automating supplier onboarding, running know-your-customer checks, ensuring compliance, reconciling exceptions and keeping payments transparent but effortless.\nNext Five Years in B2B\nLooking ahead, Wyatt sees embedded B2B payments evolving from transactional to transformative.\n\u201cThings are going to go from transactional and reactive to much more collaborative and predictive,\u201d he said.\nOne change will be in transparency. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be technology plays that create a transparency level that doesn\u2019t exist today. And that could be something that lands on a blockchain, that is immutable and technically anybody could have access to it.\u201d\nAnother shift will be financial flexibility. AP teams will gain a toolkit of options, from cards and financing to discounting, that can be dynamically applied depending on cash flow and supplier preferences.\nAnd as systems become more interconnected, ecosystem effects will accelerate. Wyatt anticipated \u201cmore of these interconnected systems\u201d breaking down silos and reshaping supply chains.\nFinally, artificial intelligence (AI) looms as a transformative force. \u201cI do think you\u2019re going to see the rise of agentic payables,\u201d Wyatt predicted. AI models may not replace humans, but they\u2019ll act as copilots by flagging anomalies, predicting supplier needs, and automating routine tasks.\nAll of these shifts point to a new mandate for the office of the CFO. No longer just guardians of the ledger, finance teams will play a central role in driving supplier collaboration, optimizing working capital, and even generating revenue."

  "argos_summary": "Rising postage rates and delivery delays are making paper checks increasingly costly and risky for B2B payments, with 63% of firms reporting fraud and operational setbacks. Digital alternatives such as dynamic discounting, automated cash flow management, and virtual cards offer faster settlement, fraud protection, and visibility, turning payments into a strategic advantage. Despite the entrenched use of checks, the economic and operational pressures are accelerating a shift toward fully digital, automated payment systems.",
