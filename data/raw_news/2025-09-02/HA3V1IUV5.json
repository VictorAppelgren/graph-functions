  "description": "It's official, Gemini is coming home to your smart speakers, cameras, display and more.",
  "content": "Gemini is finally coming home to your Google Home devices, with Google setting October 1 as the launch date. In a post on X, the company has invited users to sign up for updates, which essentially ensures you\u2019ll get notified as soon as Gemini is available for your Google Home devices.\n\nGemini integration with Google Home devices has been in the works for a while now. It was first announced at Google I/O in May, when the company revealed that users will be able to ask Gemini questions in natural language about things like their camera history. Gemini will also be able to analyze your devices and provide suggestions for automations, and you can even have it set them up using simple voice commands.\n\nMoreover, Gemini will take on Google Assistant\u2019s workload on your smart speakers and displays. Google has promised that Gemini will do a better job of understanding more complex commands compared to what you\u2019re used to with the Google Assistant. For instance, you can ask Gemini to dim the lights everywhere in the house except for the living room. As of now, it\u2019s unclear if Google will fully replace Assistant on your smart home devices with Gemini or if you\u2019ll have an option to stick to the classic Assistant experience when Gemini arrives.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly noteworthy is that back in August, Google revealed that Gemini for Home will come in both free and paid versions. However, it\u2019s still unclear how the company plans to divide features between the two tiers. It\u2019s also uncertain whether this offering will be part of the October 1 rollout, since Google previously said that the October release would be an \u201cearly access\u201d phase.\n\nThe real question is whether Gemini will actually improve things for Google Home users, many of whom have been frustrated with the Google Assistant constantly glitching out. Google promised big improvements this fall, and we\u2019re hoping Gemini is the fix.",

Learn more.\nGemini for Home is coming to replace Assistant \u2014 but is your smart home ready for its changes?\nAugust 20, 2025\n- Gemini for Home begins early access this October.\n- While it sounds like you\u2019ll have the option to stick with Assistant for a while, Google is clear that Gemini for Home will eventually replace it.\n- Gemini for Home is set to be available in both free and paid versions, though Google has yet to share more about its plans there.\nFor the past couple years, Google has been working to flesh out its next-gen AI efforts, and offering us plenty of opportunities to try out that progress for ourselves. But now in 2025, Gemini is becoming less of an option, and more of an inevitability. That\u2019s already started with Assistant on our phones, and now we\u2019re getting ready for it to extend across smart speakers and displays, as Google shares its plans about Gemini for Home.\nGemini for Home will be ready to handle many of the same sort of tasks you rely on Assistant for now, like navigating smart home controls, playing media, and helping you organize your day. Compared to Assistant, Google says users can look forward to a system that\u2019s better able to understand even complex requests \u2014 like adjusting smart home settings everywhere except for a specific room. And just like you\u2019re familiar with from on your phone, it will be happy to try answering whatever questions you throw at it.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nThat Gemini support on your smart devices will extend to Gemini Live, letting you engage in natural-feeling back-and-forth conversations with Google\u2019s agent. That sounds particularly useful when you\u2019re tackling a task you\u2019re wildly unfamiliar with, and want to try relying on Google\u2019s AI \u201csmarts\u201d to offer a little reassurance as you have it walk you through the steps \u2014 and hopefully not mess anything up too badly.\nGoogle Assistant on your smart speaker may read classic bedtime stories to your kids, but Gemini for Home on your smart speaker will take that to the next level by creating a custom story based on your prompts.\nWhile there\u2019s a lot that sounds promising here, the devil\u2019s in the details, and there are still plenty of edge cases where Gemini just hasn\u2019t been able to function at quite the same level that Assistant has \u2014 juggling multiple calendars and multiple languages stand out as some particular pain points in our mind. We\u2019ve reached out to Google in the hopes of getting some assurance that these areas might be getting better, but so far we just have faith to go on.\nWhen does all this start going down? Early access is set to begin this October, and while you may be able to stick with classic Assistant for the immediate future, Google is crystal clear that Gemini for Home is the future, and eventually the plan is to have it full-on replace Assistant on smart-home devices.\nFinally, Google leaves us with an ominous hint of things to come, noting that Gemini for Home will exist as \u201cfree and paid versions.\u201d So far the sort of Gemini access we\u2019d have to pay for has been relegated to stuff like content generation and access to its most advanced reasoning models. That leaves us extremely curious (and more than a little worried) to learn what sort of features might end up behind a paywall when we\u2019re specifically talking about Gemini for Home. Hopefully we start getting those answers soon.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nGoogle Home is becoming a house of glitches, users say (Updated: Google heard you!)\nJuly 23, 2025\n- Google Home and Nest users are reporting a significant decline in reliability, with devices frequently misunderstanding commands or failing to respond at all.\n- Core features like controlling lights, routines, and speaker groups seem to be breaking down.\n- While the exact cause of the downgraded experience is unclear, users suspect upcoming Gemini updates are to blame.\nUpdate: July 23, 2025 (9:58 PM ET): The Chief Product Officer for Google Home and Nest, Anish Kattukaran, has acknowledged the issues users have been facing on Google Home. In a post on X, the executive apologized for the ongoing problems and said that the team is working on a long-term solution.\n\u201cI want to acknowledge the recent feedback about Google Assistant reliability on our home devices. I sincerely apologize for what you\u2019re experiencing and feeling,\u201d said Kattukaran.\n\u201cWe hear you loud and clear and are committed to getting this right and making sure we have a long-term solution that provides better reliability and capability. We have been actively working on major improvements for some time and will have more to share in the fall,\u201d he added.\nOriginal article: July 22, 2025 (2:04 AM ET): Google\u2019s smart speakers and hubs appear to be steadily declining in performance. A recent Reddit thread has highlighted just how these devices, especially older Nest hubs and speakers, have become more unreliable over the years, and it\u2019s not the first time users have voiced these concerns.\n\u201cNow, I can barely get it to understand any command, or do anything that I could before. Nothing works, and all I get is \u2013 Sorry, something went wrong, try again later,\u201d wrote a frustrated user.\nUsers are reporting problems ranging from misheard commands and delayed responses to devices performing the wrong actions or entirely ignoring instructions. Everyday tasks like turning lights on or off, playing music in specific rooms, or running morning routines simply don\u2019t work like they used to.\nAre your Google Home or Nest speakers and hubs still working as expected?\nWhat\u2019s concerning is that these aren\u2019t just a few isolated complaints. It seems to be a pattern affecting users who have invested heavily in Google\u2019s smart home hardware. Features that once worked without a hitch, like controlling speakers in multiple rooms or triggering routines based on voice recognition, have become erratic or completely non-functional for many.\nOne user described how they can no longer play white noise in their child\u2019s room. Instead, the sound plays in whatever room they happen to be standing in. Another user shared a strange issue where asking for the weather gives different results depending on who is speaking in their home.\n\u201cI ask for the weather, and it responds correctly every time. My wife asks for the weather, and it literally picks wherever it wants. Yesterday it was Eddyville, Kentucky. Today it picked Shawnee, Oklahoma. We don\u2019t even live in that state,\u201d reported another user.\nSome users have also reported bizarre malfunctions. One person said that whenever they ask their Google device to turn off a fan, it turns off all the lights instead. Another user described how a simple request to turn off bedroom lights leads to shutting off every light in and around their home.\nWhile the exact cause of these issues is unclear, the common theme is that Google\u2019s smart home devices, especially older models, seem to be getting worse over time. Some users suspect that updates related to Google\u2019s upcoming Gemini integration are to blame. Others think it could be a deliberate move to phase out older hardware in favor of new devices.\nWhatever the reason, one thing is clear. Many Google Home users are no longer getting the smart experience they signed up for, and they are not happy about it.\nThank you for being part of our community.
