      "fundamental_analysis": "Higher AI adoption in the U.S. IT services sector, as highlighted by EPAM’s expansion of AI‑native platforms, signals a broader productivity boost that will lift U.S. IT spending; increased IT spending feeds into higher GDP growth, which in turn pushes the S&P 500 higher (spx) (H86O3XRUJ). The completion of EPAM’s post‑Ukraine delivery restructuring reflects a wider improvement in global supply‑chain resilience, reducing uncertainty in manufacturing and logistics that has been a source of inflationary pressure; this improvement is likely to ease U.S. wage inflation (us_inflation), lower the Fed’s policy‑rate trajectory (us_fed_policy), tighten the 10‑year Treasury yield curve (ust10y), and support the U.S. dollar index (dxy) (H86O3XRUJ). Thus the structural regime for the next 3–5 years can be mapped as: AI adoption → higher IT spending → higher GDP growth → higher spx; improved supply‑chain resilience → lower inflation → lower fed_policy → lower ust10y → higher dxy (H86O3XRUJ). Key catalysts that will test this transmission path include the Q3 2025 earnings release, which will confirm the pace of AI‑driven revenue growth, the September 2025 U.S. wage‑inflation data release, and the October 2025 Fed policy meeting; a beat on IT‑spending growth or a lower‑than‑expected inflation reading would accelerate the upward transmission to spx and dxy, while a miss or higher inflation would dampen it (H86O3XRUJ). Assuming AI adoption continues at a 5 % annual growth rate in IT spending, U.S. GDP growth remains at 2.5 %, and inflation stays near 2 %, the S&P 500 is projected to rise 6–8 % annually over the next three years, while the U.S. dollar index is expected to strengthen 3–4 % and the 10‑year Treasury yield to decline 10–15 bp (H86O3XRUJ). Risks to this base case include a rapid acceleration of low‑code/no‑code solutions that could reduce demand for custom IT services, a resurgence of geopolitical tensions that could disrupt supply chains and raise inflation, and a Fed rate‑hike cycle that could tighten liquidity and pressure the equity market (H86O3XRUJ). Watch the Q3 2025 earnings, September wage‑inflation data, and Fed policy statements; a higher‑than‑expected wage inflation or a Fed rate hike would compress the equity upside and weaken the dollar (H86O3XRUJ). Confidence in this outlook is moderate, given the clear macro transmission paths but subject to the volatility of AI adoption and geopolitical developments (H86O3XRUJ)."
