Replace broad prose with a causal chain: AI productivity gains (Range) lift growth and restrain inflation, underpinning risk appetite for AI platforms, co‑ownership/real‑asset models (Pacaso, mogul), and health‑tech diagnostics (HeartSciences); overlay cross‑border micro‑drivers (UAS hiring in Grand Forks; Japan’s tight labor market) to sketch cross‑asset flows. Tighten invalidations to concrete events: HeartSciences FDA/Medicare milestonesDelay or failure to reach FDA clearance; Pacaso expansion stalls or regulatory friction; Range onboarding materially disappoints (fails to reach even a modest adoption baseline); UAS data revisions or a sharper data gap; a sustained deterioration in inflation prints/cost of capital; and a sharp labor‑market deterioration in Japan. Add watch‑list signals with explicit thresholds (e.g., Range user‑base growth rate, Pacaso destination roll‑out cadence, HeartSciences milestone dates, UAS job trend reversals, and Japanese wage data prints). Reconcile conflicts by flagging AUVSI’s defunct projections and relying on FOM34PUWA Grand Forks data for UAS, while treating Ueda’s Jackson Hole comments as a cross‑border macro risk rather than a central forecast. Ensure the base case remains constructive but contingent on measurable AI productivity translation (cite 1–1.5% annual productivity gains; 78 million net new AI‑enabled jobs potential), with paths to 1–2 alternatives and clearly labeled risk/impairment scenarios, and conclude with a concise confidence rating. This should be done with strict source mapping: Range (UPV3X2MQ6), Pacaso/mogul (ILYC1M41F; UPV3X2MQ6), HeartSciences (A8 or UPV3X2MQ6; Medicare/FDA context), Grand Forks UAS (FOM34PUWA), Japan labor/inflation risk (A7VLN74BK), and explicitly note data limitations where stated.",
