  "description": "Debra Shigley outperformed the 2024 Democratic candidate by 10 percentage points. She'll face a Republican in a Sept. 23 runoff election.",
  "content": "Democrat Debra Shigley\u2019s surge to the top in Tuesday\u2019s special state Senate election has alarmed some senior GOP officials as the attorney and former journalist captured roughly 40% of the vote in a district that has overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump.\n\nShigley was easily the top vote-getter in the seven-candidate scramble, securing a spot in the Sept. 23 runoff election that both parties see as a midterm showcase. She\u2019ll likely face Republican Jason Dickerson, who had a small lead for second place in the jumbled field, the AJC\u2019s Michelle Baruchman reports.\n\nIt was an eye-opening result in a district spanning parts of north Fulton and Cherokee counties that was drawn to be safely Republican. Senior GOP officials were prepared for Shigley to make the runoff, but some were worried by her surge to the top of the pack.\n\nShigley outperformed the 2024 Democratic candidate by 10 percentage points \u2014 just months after Republican former state Sen. Brandon Beach carried the district with 70% of the vote to win another term.\n\nHis decision to step down to join Trump\u2019s administration triggered the low turnout contest, which both parties see as an early test of the president\u2019s popularity and future get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nNow party leaders are preparing major mobilization efforts. Georgia GOP Chair Josh McKoon said he\u2019s working with local activists to \u201cmake sure our voters turn out in force.\u201d Democrats are eyeing a statement win that could boost momentum headed into next year\u2019s midterms.\n\nShigley lost last year to state Rep. Jan Jones, the No. 2 Republican in the Georgia House, by more than 23 percentage points. For this year\u2019s campaign, she focused on bolstering health care and opposing GOP-led efforts to expand school vouchers and advance Trump-aligned policies.\n\n\u201cPeople are fed up. They are frustrated with the chaos and the status quo,\u201d Shigley said last night.\n\nDemocratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey put it more bluntly: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like elections to tell us what voters think.\u201d\n\nGood morning! We\u2019re 69 days away from elections for city offices and seats on the Public Service Commission.\n\nHere are three other things to know for today:\n\nU.S. Rep. Rick Allen dismissed concerns that Georgia\u2019s rural hospitals would be hurt by cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending law, saying the impact would be limited only to states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cNot in Georgia,\u201d the Augusta Republican said in response to a question from Savannah TV station WTOC about the bill\u2019s impact. \u201cNo, Georgia didn\u2019t expand Medicaid. He\u2019s dead wrong there. It\u2019s only in expansion states.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not true, according to multiple analyses of the bill. Spending cuts will impact Georgia differently than most other states, but they will be significant, the AJC\u2019s Ariel Hart reports.\n\nGeorgia won\u2019t lose much money from Medicaid work requirements. But Georgia hospitals will see less money than they would have from Medicaid over time. A Medicaid funding stream for many Georgia hospitals called \u201cstate directed payments\u201d is scheduled to tighten.\n\nPlus, Georgia has a hefty population of people on subsidized insurance plans sold on the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace. More than 100,000 of them are expected to go uninsured as a result of the law. In total, the health research group KFF estimates about 150,000 Georgians could lose coverage, mostly low-income workers.\n\nState lawmakers today will hold their first hearing examining how to help the growing population of people who are caregivers for aging family members.\n\nThe issue is personal for Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones II, whose father had a stroke in 2019. That\u2019s when Jones said he, his mother and his sister became his caregivers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of red tape that you have to go through to get a lot of services,\u201d Jones told the AJC\u2019s Maya T. Prabhu. \u201cThey\u2019re there, but you have to go through different things.\u201d\n\nWhile today\u2019s meeting is in Augusta, the remaining meetings will be held in Atlanta, Jones said.\n\nHe hopes the committee finds ways to help families care for their elderly relatives, whether it be cash payments or allowing employees to legally request more flexible work schedules. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that more than 20% of Georgia\u2019s population will be 60 or older by 2030, an increase of almost 34% from 2012.\n\nSenior Judge David Emerson is holding an emergency hearing today following up on his order directing the Fulton County Commission to appoint two Republicans to the local election board.\n\nRepublicans have asked Emerson to hold the commissioners in contempt for voting against the appointments. The consequences will be at Emerson\u2019s discretion. But if he were to find the commissioners in contempt, he could fine them or even put them in jail \u2014 an outcome that would reverberate across the state\u2019s political world.\n\nIt\u2019s a big moment for Emerson, who spent more than three decades as a Superior Court judge in Douglas County. He stepped down in 2021. He\u2019s now a senior judge, giving him authority to preside over cases all over the state whenever a local judge has a conflict.\n\nEmerson was in the news back in 2017 when attorney Ashleigh Merchant accused him of speaking to her in a condescending way in court. Merchant would later be famous for revealing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 relationship with the special prosecutor in the 2020 election interference case.\n\nIn 2022, Emerson ruled Shelia Edwards \u2014 then a Democratic candidate for the Public Service Commission \u2014 could stay on the ballot despite not living in the district she wanted to represent. That election ultimately didn\u2019t happen after another judge ruled the commission\u2019s at-large elections violated federal law.\n\nNearly 14% of active registered voters cast ballots in Tuesday\u2019s special Senate election spanning portions of Cherokee and Fulton counties.\n\nSpecial elections are notorious for their low voter turnout. But participation in Tuesday\u2019s election outperformed the statewide Public Service Commission primaries from earlier this year.\n\nVoter turnout in the June 17 statewide primaries was just 2.8%. Voters in state Senate District 21 beat that number in early voting alone as 8% of voters cast ballots ahead of Tuesday\u2019s contest.\n\nTurnout was so low in June that multiple county election officials considered consolidating polling places during the runoff election so they wouldn\u2019t have to waste money staffing locations with hardly any voters.\n\nThe turnout was low, in part, because it was a special election for a position most voters don\u2019t understand. A state Senate seat is more accessible to voters. And Tuesday\u2019s race featured seven candidates, all of whom were spending money to turn out voters in a smaller district.\n\nToday on the \u201cPolitically Georgia\u201d podcast Georgia State law professor Anthony Michael Kreis explains why President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to activate the National Guard in Washington has raised constitutional concerns. Also, AJC business editor J. Scott Trubey and Ife Finch Floyd, director of economic justice at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute discuss troubling unemployment trends for Black women.\n\nYou can listen and subscribe to Politically Georgia for free at Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nHave a question or comment for the show?

Sanford Bishop is hosting an event in Columbus today to identify ways to support military families.\n\nThey have invited members of the public to attend the daylong event that will include breakout sessions, panel discussions and a resource fair.\n\nWarren served \u201cwith humility, integrity, and an unwavering focus on doing what was right for our citizens,\u201d the commission said in a statement.\n\nIn a social media post, Attorney General Chris Carr called Warren \u201ca true servant leader who impacted the lives of those around him.\u201d\n\nWant a birthday shoutout in the Politically Georgia newsletter?

There are many food assistance programs available to assist and this webpage provides an overview of them.\n- Housing\n- Moving is common in the military. Whether you're relocating to another state or country, there's a pattern to making your new nest \u2013 finding a home, packing, moving your stuff and sorting out other logistics. As a service member, you're given various Department of Defense allowances to help offset the costs of housing and moving.\nAbout the Congressional Military Family Caucus\nThe Congressional Military Family Caucus seeks to raise awareness about and improve U.S. military's family resources. Specifically, the Congressional Military Family Caucus focuses on issues such as education, childcare, healthcare, spousal employment, and the effects of multiple deployments. The Caucus seeks to educate Members of the United States Congress and their staff about the challenges facing our nation's military families in order to develop federal policies that better support our nation's military families.\nThe bipartisan Congressional Military Family Caucus was founded in 2009 by Representatives Sanford D. Bishop, Jr. (D-GA-02) and former Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). Congressman Bishop now co-chairs the caucus with Congresswoman Jen A. Kiggans (R-VA-02).\nIf you would like more information about the caucus, please call either (202) 225-3631 (Rep. Bishop) or (202) 225-4215 (Rep.

      "text": "Cracker Barrel is keeping its old-time logo after new design elicited an uproar\nCracker Barrel is keeping its old-time logo after new design elicited an uproar\nCracker Barrel said late Tuesday it\u2019s returning to its old logo after critics \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 protested the company\u2019s plan to modernize.\nIn a post on its website, Cracker Barrel said it will retain its old logo, which features an older man in overalls sitting next to a barrel and the words \u201cOld Country Store.\u201d\n\u201cWe thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur new logo is going away and our \u2018Old Timer\u2019 will remain.\u201d\nThe tempest over the logo began last week, when the company announced plans for a simplified design featuring only the company\u2019s name. Lebanon, Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has 660 restaurants in 43 states, made the change as part of a wider plan to modernize its restaurants and appeal to younger customers.\nThe chain\u2019s sales have been slipping as it faces growing competition from breakfast chains and others. In its 2024 fiscal year, Cracker Barrel\u2019s same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, dropped 0.1% despite a 4.9% increase in menu prices. Same-store retail sales at its shops fell 5.5%.\nBut many protested the change. On Monday, Cracker Barrel put out an apologetic statement, saying it \u201ccould have done a better job sharing who we are and who we\u2019ll always be.\u201d\nAt that point, Cracker Barrel didn\u2019t say it would change the logo, but said it would listen to its customers and keep many of the things they have come to love about the restaurant, like the rocking chairs on its front porches. The company said it would continue to honor Uncle Herschel \u2014 the older man in its logo, who represents the uncle of Cracker Barrel\u2019s founder \u2014 on its menu and on items sold in its stores.\nBut the controversy continued. On Tuesday morning, Trump said via Truth Social that Cracker Barrel \u201cshould go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before.\u201d Cracker Barrel\u2019s shares rose after more than a week of declines.\nBy Tuesday evening, Cracker Barrel had made its decision and scrapped the new logo.\n\u201cAt Cracker Barrel, it\u2019s always been \u2013 and always will be \u2013 about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs a proud American institution, our 70,000 hardworking employees look forward to welcoming you to our table soon.\u201d\nTrump was among those celebrating the move.\n\u201cGood luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!\u201d Trump said via Truth Social."

      "text": "May 23, 2022\nOlder Georgians can remain independent and age their way\nOlder Georgians play a vital role in their communities. They are mentors, economic contributors, caretakers and volunteers. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that more than 20% of Georgia\u2019s population will be 60 or older by the year 2030, an increase of almost 34% from 2012. With this large increase in seniors to the population, their wants and needs are of vital concern. No senior wants to be reliant on others to fulfill their daily needs in their homes. The Division of Aging Services and the 12 Area Agencies on Aging provide resources to help seniors remain independent in their communities for as long as possible.\nThis Older Americans Month, DHS is highlighting the resources available to help Georgia seniors and their caregivers remain independent. Resources like assistive technology, home services, like home-delivered and community-based meals, and home modification and repair may be available.\nTo learn about home and community-based services like food delivery, congregate meals at senior centers and caregiver resources, please visit Home & Community Based Services | Division of Aging Services | Georgia Department of Human Services. The Georgia Aging and Disability Resource Connection can direct you to resources available in your area. Visit Georgia ADRC or call 1-866-552-4464.\nThe Division of Aging Services works with Georgia Tech\u2019s Tools For Life, the Northwest Georgia Center for Independent Living and Friends of Disabled Adults and Children to help Georgia\u2019s older adults and adults with disabilities maintain independent, healthy lives."
