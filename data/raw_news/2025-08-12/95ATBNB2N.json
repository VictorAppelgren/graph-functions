  "content": "Author Jane Leavy was on the veranda of the famed Otesaga Hotel overlooking the lake in Cooperstown for the 2019 Hall of Fame induction weekend when she was hit by a fastball right between the eyes.\n\nShe was there with two Hall of Famers \u2014 former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre and legendary Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax. In 2002, Leavy wrote a brilliant biography, \u201cSandy Koufax: A Lefty\u2019s Legacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s game is not the game they played,\u201d Leavy wrote in that book, remembering her conversation with the two legends.\n\n\u201cInevitably, the subject turns to how hard pitchers are throwing and how little they are pitching. \u2018Half the time the pitchers don\u2019t even know where the ball is going,\u2019 Sandy said. \u2018Hard to watch,\u2019 Joe replied. \u2018I don\u2019t watch,\u2019 Sandy said.\u201d\n\nHere you had Koufax, one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the game, who can\u2019t bring himself to watch it anymore, and Torre who has been involved in Major League BasebalL for nearly 60 years, at the time employed as MLB\u2019s chief baseball officer, saying his product was hard to watch on the most hallowed of weekends in the game.\n\nFor Leavy, whose love of baseball is soul deep, it was a stunning revelation. \u201cI thought, how is it possible that I watch the MLB network by day and some ball games \u2014 any ball game \u2014 at night and final computer Yankee games on my iPhone under the table during dinner parties even once that I host and they don\u2019t?\u201d\n\nIt was a wake-up call of sorts that put Leavy on a path to try to find out what went wrong with the game she loved. Her investigation resulted in her latest book, \u201cMake Me Commissioner \u2014 I Know What\u2019s Wrong with Baseball and How to Fix It\u201d (Grand Central Publishing, on sale Sept. 9).\n\nPretty nervy to write a book declaring that she should be commissioner of baseball, but she has the bonafides \u2013 in addition to writing the definitive work on an icon like Koufax, Leavy also wrote the book on Mickey Mantle \u2013 \u201cThe Last Boy\u201d in 2010.\n\nShe followed that up with one of the best baseball and sports business books I\u2019ve ever read \u2013 \u201cThe Big Fella \u2013 Babe Ruth and the World He Created\u201d in 2018.\n\nIf knowledge and passion count, Leavy may be more qualified than the current commissioner.\n\nThe new book, though, is more than an examination of the warts of the game. It also reveals what is still right about baseball and tells stories about the personalities on each side of the divide in baseball between numbers and humanity.\n\n\u201cAnalytics placed the premium on \u2018working the count,\u2019 \u2018taking your walks,\u2019 \u2018grinding out at-bats,\u2019 \u2018making the pitcher work,\u2019 exhausting him and fans to get rid of him early,\u201d Leavy wrote. \u201cThat became moot once algorithms definitively demonstrated that no starting pitcher should face the lineup three times; max-heave pitching meant he wouldn\u2019t last that long anyway. Put it all together and you had yourself an aesthetic problem. As Miami Marlins Vice President of Player Personnel, Sam Mondray Cohen put it \u201cthe game\u2019s smarter, stronger and uglier.\u201d\n\nShe takes you behind the scenes at places like Driveline, a data-performance center in Titusville, Washington, where hitters and pitchers go to maximize the numbers to improve their production \u2013 more than 100 major league players have come through the lab, including 40 All-Stars, five MVPs and four Cy Young winners.\n\nShe examines the appeal of the barnstorming Savannah Bananas and has conversations with baseball\u2019s ambassador to another universe, former Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee. It is, as the back cover blurb describes, \u201ca whirlwind tour of the country seeking answers\u201d to the questions that has made the game uglier.\n\nThe godfather of the analytics movement, Bill James, recognizes that baseball is in danger of suffocating on statistics: \u201c100% of the problem \u2014 relentless pressure on players and managers to find competitive advantages, on the one side, versus a complete lack of management (ownership and league officials) to defend against the negative consequences of that in the entertainment value of the sport.\u201d\n\nThe book is not an attack on analytics and the recognition of its place in baseball. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tell individual front offices that they should be dumber for the sake of the game,\u201d Orioles general manager Mike Elias said.\n\nBut it is an entertaining and informative examination of the conflict inside clubhouses and front offices \u2013 choking on information while gasping for knowledge",
