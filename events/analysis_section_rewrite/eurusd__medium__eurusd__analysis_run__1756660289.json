      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Remove all gold/precious‑metal references** – the analysis should stay strictly on USD‑related FX. Delete the sentences about gold falling, gold ETF holdings, and any mention of “precious metals.”  \n2. **Add inline citations** for every substantive claim. For example:  \n   - “DXY rose 0.36 % to a one‑week high (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n   - “EUR/USD fell 0.27 % (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n   - “USDJPY rose 0.28 % (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n   - “Fed futures discount a 25 bp cut at the September FOMC at 88 % (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n   - “ECB swaps price a 6 % chance of a 25 bp cut (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n   - “Trump’s tariff announcements (100 % semiconductor tariff, 15.2 % average tariff) (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n   - “CPI release on 12 Aug 2025 (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n3. **Clarify magnitude ranges** – keep the 0.5–1.0 % DXY rise forecast and explicitly state the 0.36 % current move.  \n4. **Re‑frame the causal chain** to emphasize:  \n   - **Catalysts**: CPI release, Fed policy (Bowman’s 3 cuts), tariff announcements.  \n   - **Transmission**: Higher U.S. inflation expectations → forward‑rate premium → DXY strength; tariff‑driven risk premium → euro & yen weakness.  \n5. **State invalidations clearly** – list Fed cuts, a softer CPI, or an ECB rate cut as the primary scenarios that could flatten or reverse the DXY trend.  \n6. **Keep watch signals concise** – CPI data, Fed minutes, ECB policy, tariff announcements, EUR/USD, USDJPY.  \n7. **Trim any extraneous narrative** – focus on the 3–6 month horizon, base case, and alternative scenarios.  \n\nImplement these edits to produce a tight, evidence‑backed, FX‑centric view that satisfies the Argos standards.",
