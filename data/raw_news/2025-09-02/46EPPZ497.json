Kennedy Jr. have announced plans to reintroduce the presidential fitness test, which has been widely discredited as a measure of health since the 1950s. Amanda Marcotte, an analyst for Salon, argues that this move has dark motivations, as it aligns with the belief that if only Americans are fit and therefore have no need for modern health care, they will not need modern treatments. She argues that the focus on physical fitness is on strength and not just appearance, but also on health. Marcotte also criticizes the Trump administration's elimination of programs to improve access to healthy foods and reduce pollution.",

      "text": "None of Trump\u2019s Obama claims are new. That\u2019s why MAGA is baying for blood\nSome of Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters are expressing wariness over the prospect of prolonged investigations into supposed crimes committed by former President Barack Obama and other high-ranking officials.\nThey note that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s accusation of a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d about the 2016 election recycles narratives put forward by conservative influencers in Trump\u2019s first term.\nThey want to go straight to arrests.\nAnd like many, they see Gabbard\u2019s case against Obama as a transparent ploy to distract attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case, in which Trump\u2019s links to the deceased financier and sex offender are increasingly under the spotlight.\nPatrick Howley, a journalist who cycled through conservative media outlets before moving on to conspiracy content and eventually flagrant white nationalism and antisemitism, is a case in point.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop talking about Epstein just because Tulsi Gabbard decides to confirm the 2017 Internet yet again\u2026. If you arrest Obama, maybe I\u2019ll tune in,\u201d Howley wrote on X on July 21.\nHowley doubled down the following day, writing, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do 2017 Crossfire Hurricane content again [a reference to the FBI investigation of Russian links to Trump] unless Obama and [former Secretary of State] Hillary [Clinton] actually gets arrested. I don\u2019t have to pretend this stuff is new just because the Admin is in damage control mode over Epstein.\u201d\nIn early 2017, having worked for conservative outlets including the American Spectator, Daily Caller and Breitbart News, Howley described his new project, what would become Big League Politics, to the Atlantic as an organ for \u201cTrump administration policies that generally fall under a populist-nationalist window.\u201d\nHowley was part of a new cohort of media provocateurs who unabashedly promoted Trump while pushing supporters towards ever more radical positions. Stories suggesting a criminal conspiracy by national security officials in the Obama administration to undermine Trump by linking him to Russia were bread and butter.\nInvestigations by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmed the assessment of the Obama administration that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, including hacking Democratic National Committee emails, to benefit Trump.\nRegardless, on July 21, Trump posted on Truth Social: \u201cObama himself manufactured the Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX, Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe, and numerous others participated in this, THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY!\u201d\nTrump\u2019s recent post tracks closely with content Howley was producing more than five years ago, including a March 2019 story headlined, \u201cHOWLEY: Here\u2019s the Full Story of How Obama, Hillary and [former CIA Director John] Brennan Carried Out the Crime of the Century.\u201d\nIn other stories from 2018 through 2020, Howley described a supposed conspiracy involving \u201cvengeful government agents trying to play politics by bending the law against a populist candidate;\u201d \u201cevidence of a Democrat and establishment Republican effort to set up the Trump campaign for a future Russian collusion case;\u201d and a \u201cgrowing #ObamaGate scandal that threatens to disgrace his public legacy.\u201d\nEclipsed by a new cohort of MAGA influencers that includes Charlie Kirk, the podcaster and CEO of Turning Point USA, Howley isn\u2019t shy about expressing his resentment.\n\u201cThat it took EIGHT YEARS to find out the Obama Intel apparatus manufactured intelligence to delegitimize and cripple the Trump administration is a scandal all unto itself,\u201d Kirk posted on X on July 21, garnering 1.1 million views. \u201cWhy on earth did it take so long?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you guys just recycle the same old stuff at opportune moments while also ignoring certain stories at pivotal moments based on the whims of the handlers who run conservative media?\u201d Howley retorted, pulling only 1,355 views.\nSteve Bannon, MAGA\u2019s lead strategist and a vocal proponent for Trump to arrest political enemies, once employed Howley at Breitbart and praised him as \u201csmart, tough and aggressive.\u201d\n'Bits of red meat'\nHowley\u2019s impatience with perpetual promises of \u201carrests\u201d appears to be shared by a growing number of Trump supporters.\nJoe Biggs, a Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy who worked as a reporter for the conspiracy theory website InfoWars in 2016, posted on X on July 19: \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing Hillary for prison and so much more for years. Yet nothing ever happened. It\u2019s the same ole song and dance; the only difference is the year. Republicans are spineless cowards. Always have been and always will. I hope they prove me wrong, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d\nOwen Shroyer, an InfoWars host convicted of illegally entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 (and pardoned by Trump), lamented on X: \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re talking about Obama and Russian Collusion Hoax is because no one was arrested in Trump\u2019s first term. So is this the new Republican game? Talk about deep state criminals on the campaign but never arrest them?\u201d\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who was elected in 2020 after embracing the QAnon conspiracy theory, warned that Trump\u2019s base will turn if he doesn\u2019t deliver arrests.\n\u201cIf you tell the base of people, who support you, of deep state treasonous crimes, election interference, blackmail, and rich powerful elite evil cabals, then you must take down every enemy of The People,\u201d she posted on X on July 21. \u201cIf not. // The base will turn and there\u2019s no going back. // Dangling bits of red meat never satisfied. // They want the whole steak dinner and nothing else will satisfy.\u201d\nFor some Trump followers, the logical next step is violence.\nResponding to Howley\u2019s complaint that \u201cinfluencers can come up with different strategies to try to dupe us or silence us about how nothing ever happens,\u201d while \u201carrests and transformational change\u201d remain elusive,\u201d one X user responded: \u201cYes. // The only way s--- every gets done is violence.\u201d\nAfter Gabbard\u2019s claims about a \u201cyears-long coup\u201d and \u201ctreasonous conspiracy,\u201d the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism clocked a surge of comments on the social media platforms Truth Social, Gab and Telegram \u201ctargeting Obama as treasonous and deserving of either imprisonment or a form of capital punishment.\u201d"

      "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday launched an investigation into U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s purge of independent experts from a panel on vaccine recommendations.\nLast month, Kennedy announced that he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, despite promising during his Senate confirmation hearing to keep the committee intact.\nAt the time, Sanders (I-VT), chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, warned that \"firing independent vaccine experts is a dangerous, unprecedented move that will make it harder for the American people to access vaccines that are safe, effective, and essential to saving lives.\"\nAfter the firings, Kennedy said, \"We're going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel\u2014not anti-vaxxers\u2014bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\"\nIn a letter sent to Kennedy on Tuesday, Sanders and seven other Democratic senators said those fears have come to pass. Kennedy, they said, has replaced the panel of experts with \"prominent vaccine deniers.\"\nThe most prominent of these figures is Dr. Robert Malone, who has described it as \"high praise\" to be dubbed an \"anti-vaxxer.\"\nMalone gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic by casting doubt on the illness's severity and baselessly suggesting that the mRNA vaccines used to treat the disease were \"causing a form of AIDS.\"\nEarlier this year, Malone also attempted to foment doubt that children had died due to the unprecedented measles outbreak in Texas.\nKennedy also appointed the former leader of his anti-vaccine organization, the Children's Health Defense, Lyn Redwood, a longtime proponent of the false belief that the vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) causes autism.\nAlso on the committee is Vicky Pebsworth Debold, founder of the National Vaccine Information Center\u2014one of the longest-running anti-vaccine organizations in America\u2014who has argued that a vaccination caused her child's autism.\nACIP is in charge of examining scientific findings to make recommendations to the public about which vaccines to get and when.\n\"These individuals,\" the senators said, \"have already taken steps to upend decades of scientific research and vaccine policy, threatening the health and safety of all Americans.\"\nWhen Kennedy's new handpicked committee met for the first time in late June, the members made substantial changes to vaccine policy and hinted at others coming in the future.\nThe most significant change they made was the recommendation that Americans receive flu vaccinations free of the preservative thimerosal, which is partially made of mercury and prevents germs and fungi from contaminating batches of vaccines.\nThimerosal, which is a component of many multidose vaccines, has never been found harmful by any scientific study. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided a document to the committee that included 25 years of studies indicating thimerosal's safety. But that document was removed from the meeting without explanation.\nWhen they questioned ACIP about its removal, the senators say Malone replied that it was \"not authorized by the office of the secretary,\" which the senators concluded meant that Kennedy or one of his staff \"had the document taken off CDC\u2019s website.\"\nInstead of credible science, Redwood presented a report likely generated by artificial intelligence, which included many debunked claims about the dangers of thimerosal, and even made reference to a CDC study on the dangers of the preservative that did not exist.\nKennedy's ACIP also determined that it would revise the childhood vaccine schedule that has been in place for decades. That schedule includes vaccines for polio, chickenpox, diphtheria, and tetanus\u2014illnesses that once routinely killed children but have been virtually eradicated by mass immunization.\nThe recommended vaccine schedule, the senators noted, determines what immunizations are required to be covered by health insurance companies and government programs like Medicaid and Medicare.\n\"If insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs stop covering vaccines, Americans will be forced to pay out of pocket,\" the senators said. \"The only people who will be able to afford vaccines will be the wealthy.\"\nThe senators warned that this, along with Kennedy and his appointees' undermining of vaccine science, would result in \"a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.\"\nUnder Kennedy, the United States has already experienced its largest measles outbreak in 33 years, which has resulted in the first deaths from the disease in over a decade, following a downswing in measles vaccination.\nDespite this, Kennedy has continued to downplay the disease's severity and the vaccine's well-documented effectiveness, even claiming that it causes \"deaths every year.\"\nThe senators demanded that Kennedy provide information about why each of the nonpartisan members of ACIP were fired, and what criteria and vetting process was used to pick the anti-vaccine figures who replaced them.\n\"The harm your actions will cause is significant,\" the senators told Kennedy. \"As your new ACIP makes recommendations based on pseudoscience, fewer and fewer Americans will have access to fewer and fewer vaccines. And as you give a platform to conspiracy theorists, and even promote their theories yourself, Americans will continue to lose confidence in whatever vaccines are still available.\""

      "text": "Gym class could become less traumatizing for some K-12 students under a new national initiative announced today.\nIf you\u2019re like me, you remember having to endure the Presidential Physical Fitness Test back in the day, which tested students in curl-ups, pull-ups, a timed shuttle run, an endurance run/walk, and the sit-and-reach.\nIf you\u2019re like me, being faced with the prospect of 40 push-ups, 10 pull-ups, and a 6:30 mile run for a Presidential Physical Fitness Award as a 14-year-old was about as appealing as a daily trip to the principal\u2019s office. (Let\u2019s be honest: I\u2019d be lucky to hit those benchmarks now, 10 years later.)\nStarting next school year, the test will become a thing of the past. It\u2019s being replaced by the Presidential Youth Fitness Program (PYFP), a \u201chealth-related, criterion-based assessment\u201d which resulted from a partnership between the President\u2019s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, the Amateur Athletic Union, the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance (AAHPERD), Cooper Institute, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe departure from the test, part of the President\u2019s Challenge, signals a move away from measuring students\u2019 performance and puts more emphasis on assessing students\u2019 health, according to the PYFP\u2019s website.\n\u201cTo keep fitness in a positive mode, children\u2019s individual fitness scores will not be used as a criteria for grading in physical education class and will be confidential between the teacher, student, and parent,\u201d said Paul Roetert, chief executive officer of the AAHPERD, in a statement.\nUnder the new program, students\u2019 fitness will be measured using the Cooper Institute\u2019s FITNESSGRAM, which measures five areas of health-related fitness: aerobic capacity, body composition, flexibility, muscle strength, and muscular endurance. FITNESSGRAM\u2019s Healthy Fitness Zone standards \u201crepresent the minimal levels of fitness needed for good health based on the student\u2019s age and gender,\u201d according to the PYFP website.\nThe PYFP\u2019s website also includes a section devoted to professional development, which includes a free monthly webinar series on youth fitness and health. The first webinar in this series will take place on Tuesday, Sept. 25, at 1 p.m. Eastern, where the AAHPERD will walk through the basics of the new PYFP.\n\u201cThrough the new Presidential Youth Fitness Program, physical education teachers will have access to the necessary tools they need to help children develop healthy lifestyles that will optimize their health and educational experience beyond the school years,\u201d said the AAHPERD\u2019s Roetert in a statement.\nWhile the PYFP won\u2019t be issuing Youth Fitness Test awards anymore, free PYFP school recognition certificates will be offered. Certificates, medals, and badges will also be available in an online store as rewards for students who participate in the program.\nNancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association, threw her support behind the PYFP in a statement released today.\n\u201cThis assessment will be a great way to evaluate the health impact of physical education programs in schools and allow for a standardized comparison of fitness levels of children across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe information collected can be used to inform course curriculum development, children\u2019s physical activity programming, and policy change.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a good run, Physical Fitness Test. I\u2019ll always remember how few pull-ups I could do back in my earlier years, thanks to you."

Kennedy Jr.\nPsychiatrist Christopher Rodgman, MD asked, \"Question: has Donald Trump, an exquisite physical specimen, personally passed this presidential fitness test?\"\nHe later added: \"It\u2019s just funny imagining Trump trying to do 10 pushups.\"\nThere were several posts of photos of Trump, many of which showed the 79-year-old in an unflattering light.\n\"Him first,\" posted an X user named Miss Claudia Menlo.\nOthers requested that Trump be required to take the test himself, with some asking him to pass just one of the requirements, such as 10 push-ups.\n\"I won\u2019t criticize him again for the rest of his term if Trump does the Presidential Fitness Test live on national television,\" pledged appellate attorney Peter J.

She said that services including hospice care, behavioral health long-term care, and nursing home services could see reimbursement cuts significantly steeper than 3%.\n\"These reductions may cause some providers to stop accepting Medicaid patients, as the lowered rates could make it financially unsustainable to continue offering care,\" she said.\nThe Tar Heel State isn't the only one reeling from Medicaid cuts, as Colorado Public Radio reported that the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which manages the state's Medicaid program, held a webinar this week in which it outlined plans to, in the words of department director Kim Bimestefer, \"mitigate the loss of coverage and its catastrophic consequences to Coloradans, providers, and the economy.\"\nThis will be easier said than done, however, as Colorado Public Radio noted that numbers reviewed by the department estimate that \"hundreds of thousands\" of residents in the state could lose healthcare access thanks to cuts from the GOP budget package.\nIn addition to people who will lose coverage thanks to the work requirements passed in the legislation, an estimated 112,000 people who buy health insurance policies from state exchanges could lose them after the expected expiration of enhanced tax credits passed by Democrats during former President Joe Biden's term.\nTaking a look at the broader nationwide picture, Stateline reported that even some Republicans attending the National Conference of State Legislatures summit in Boston this week expressed anxiety about the impact the cuts will have on the people whom they represent.\nThe publication quoted Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste, who said during the summit that he was particularly concerned about the impact the cuts would have on rural communities. Among other things, he pointed to a provision in the law that will deliver a $209 million cut in Medicaid funds to Oklahoma, as well as the fact that complying with work requirement verifications will cost an estimated $30 million.\n\"All of those things added together come up to a really big number,\" said Haste. \"We don't know exactly what that is.\"\nHawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said during the summit that the impact of the Medicaid cuts would be absolutely brutal, but added that the only thing Democrats can do for now is make sure their voters know whom to blame for what's happening.\n\"Who's going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?\" he asked during a panel discussion. \"If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.\""

  "argos_summary": "President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to reinstate the presidential fitness test for schoolchildren, a move criticized by health experts and activists as a nostalgic, punitive measure that could undermine public health initiatives. Amanda Marcotte argues the test is rooted in unscientific notions of fitness and serves to justify cuts to healthcare and food assistance, while highlighting the broader \u2018Make America Healthy Again\u2019 agenda that favors the wealthy and marginalizes vulnerable populations. The proposal has sparked backlash from educators, public health advocates, and lawmakers who warn that the test could exacerbate health disparities and distract from essential services such as Medicaid and nutrition programs.",
