  "title": "How An Integrated Co-Sourcing Model Strengthens Accounting Function",
  "description": "Co-sourcing creates a structure that supports the team and adapts as the business evolves.",
  "content": "Most accounting teams weren\u2019t built to scale. They were built to close the books and stay compliant. That worked\u2014until the demands outgrew the structure. Today, businesses expect sharper insight and tighter alignment between accounting, tax and planning. And leaders are trying to meet those expectations while navigating a shrinking talent pool, rising compliance demands and a wave of new technology. In particular, AI is pressuring companies to rethink headcount and get more revenue per employee to remain competitive.\n\nThese pressures are forcing companies to take a hard look at how their accounting function is built. One model that\u2019s gaining traction and that my company champions is integrated co-sourcing\u2014a hybrid approach that blends in-house teams with external support to create a more resilient and cost-effective structure. It\u2019s not outsourcing, and it\u2019s not just temporary staffing. It\u2019s a strategic way to shore up capacity and give internal teams the breathing room to focus on what matters most. Here\u2019s how it works and how leaders can use it to build a stronger function from the inside out.\n\nWhy The Traditional Models Are Under Strain\n\nThe accounting industry is facing a talent pipeline problem. According to Bloomberg, the pool of accountants and auditors dropped by 340,000 (registration required) in recent years. Meanwhile, fewer students are entering accounting programs. For companies trying to hire, that adds up to longer searches, higher costs and a revolving door of talent that\u2019s tough to stabilize.\n\nThe job itself is shifting, too. Today\u2019s accounting leaders are expected to do more than report the numbers; they\u2019re being pulled into strategic planning, forecasting and decision support. That\u2019s hard to deliver when teams are already stretched, and even harder when you\u2019re constantly onboarding or scrambling to cover turnover.\n\nTechnology adds another layer. AI is high on the CFO agenda. PwC\u2019s 2025 Pulse Survey found that 58% are investing in AI and analytics to adjust planning and improve decision making and forecasting. But without connected systems or enough internal bandwidth, those initiatives can easily lose steam before they gain traction.\n\nTo keep up, many companies try to muscle through\u2014adding headcount, layering on new tools or asking already busy teams to do more. But an internal team can only stretch so far, especially when something unexpected comes up, such as an audit. Even the best-run departments can struggle to scale. Hiring takes time. Training takes longer. And losing a key person at the wrong moment can throw the whole operation out of sync.\n\nOutsourcing can offer speed and flexibility, but external teams don\u2019t always have the context to deliver the level of accuracy or insight that leaders need. And without a firm grasp of the business, continuity tends to suffer.\n\nRather than outsourcing the whole function, co-sourcing reinforces the team that\u2019s already in place. You keep your internal staff where they\u2019re strongest, then bring in outside help to fill in gaps or bring in specialized skills you don\u2019t have in-house. Co-sourcing creates a structure that supports the team and adapts as the business evolves.\n\nWhen it\u2019s done right, co-sourcing gives companies room to grow without expanding headcount. It also shortens the ramp-up time for new capabilities, making it easier to manage changing priorities or respond quickly to things such as audits or system rollouts.\n\nHow To Make It Work\n\nThere\u2019s no standard blueprint for co-sourcing\u2014it must be built around the needs of the business. But one thing is consistent: It works best when it\u2019s built around a true partnership. Leaders thinking about this approach should ask the following questions early to set it up for long-term success:\n\u2022 \u201cWhere do we need the most support?\u201d Start by taking an honest look at where your team is strong\u2014and where it\u2019s stretched too thin. Some departments struggle to keep the monthly close on track. Others are buried in tax complexity or stuck trying to get reports out of fragmented systems. Co-sourcing is most effective when it\u2019s aimed at solving specific pain points, not just plugging generic staffing gaps.\n\u2022 \u201cHow will we collaborate day-to-day?\u201d Seamless collaboration takes shared systems, clear handoffs and agreed-upon workflows. Everyone must work from the same data, with a common understanding of who\u2019s doing what, when it\u2019s due and what the final output should look like.\n\u2022 \u201cCan the model scale with us?\u201d A strong co-sourcing model should scale with you, whether you\u2019re rolling out a new system or building out new reporting. It\u2019s that ability to expand and contract without disruption that turns co-sourcing from a short-term patch into a lasting solution.\n\nWhen To Go A Different Way\n\nWhile the co-sourcing model offers tremendous value in the right situations, it\u2019s not a universal solution. For companies with a well-staffed, high-performing internal finance team and mature systems in place, layering in a co-sourced model may create unnecessary complexity. In those cases, targeted project-based support or strategic advisory may be a better fit than an ongoing co-sourcing arrangement.\n\nCo-sourcing also isn\u2019t ideal when a client expects a full-time, on-premise resource. The co-sourcing model is designed to be flexible, efficient and tech-enabled\u2014leveraging remote workflows and shared platforms. That said, we\u2019ve had situations where limited in-person presence early on helped build trust and uncover additional needs. When used intentionally, being on-site can serve as a relationship accelerant, but it\u2019s not the default approach we recommend.\n\nLastly, we tend to avoid co-sourcing relationships where the client expects us to fully replicate the responsibilities of a full-time controller or CFO\u2014especially if the business lacks clarity on what they actually need. Co-sourcing works best when there\u2019s alignment around shared ownership: The co-sourcing provider brings process, structure and expertise, but the client is still engaged and accountable. When expectations are misaligned\u2014or when the client is looking to fully \u201cset it and forget it\u201d\u2014the model breaks down. In those situations, either a full outsourced accounting model or a clear internal hire may be the better answer.\n\nA Model For The Future Of Accounting\n\nThe accounting function is more complex than ever. Leaders are expected to deliver strategic insight, keep up with compliance, push digital initiatives forward and manage risk, all while contending with a shrinking talent pool.\n\nCo-sourcing offers a practical way through. By combining internal strengths with outside support, you gain the flexibility, expertise and resilience needed to support your business today and prepare it for what\u2019s next.\n\nis an invitation-only organization for executives in successful accounting, financial planning and wealth management firms.",

      "text": "{{item.title}}\n{{item.text}}\n{{item.title}}\n{{item.text}}\nIn today\u2019s uncertain economy, chief financial officers (CFOs) are helping businesses make sense of complexity and act with clarity. Findings from PwC\u2019s May 2025 Pulse Survey show how executives across the C-suite are stepping up as strategic leaders in a time of rapid change. CFOs are turning performance data and policy signals into practical strategies \u2014 balancing near-term needs with long-term goals to guide smarter decisions, now and for the future \u2014 a clear sign that finance leaders are taking an active role in reshaping strategy.\nThey\u2019re pressure-testing forecasts against policy shifts and adjusting planning \u2014 65% are adjusting financial forecasts and budgets in response to current volatility and 58% are investing in AI and advanced analytics \u2014 all while breaking down silos and helping the business stay agile and grounded.\nWhile volatility and inflation remain top CFO concerns, the shifting dynamics of US economic policy are front and center. Fifty-seven percent of finance leaders say they\u2019re shifting short-term strategy as a result, citing it as a top-3 factor. But it\u2019s not just a directional shift \u2014 it\u2019s a strategic reset. CFOs are moving away from reactive cost containment and toward proactive scenario modeling, cash flow resilience and performance forecasting.\nFinance leaders aren\u2019t just acknowledging change, they\u2019re acting on it. Two-thirds (65%) are adjusting financial forecasts and budgets, 61% are implementing cost reductions (excluding layoffs) and 54% are assessing tariff impacts. It\u2019s part of a broader pivot \u2014 from reacting to disruption to actively shaping strategy. And while many leaders focus on short-term disruption, leading CFOs play the long game. They model policy impacts, build resilient plans and ground their organizations in financial reality to serve as performance stewards and trusted guides for what\u2019s ahead.\nCFOs today are looking beyond the current volatility \u2014 and beyond the finance function \u2014 to the bigger picture. They\u2019re hunkering down to help get their companies through the short term while taking a broader view of how everything connects. By bridging finance with the business, CFOs are redefining leadership and proving that finance can power performance and purpose.\nAs CFOs shift strategy to adapt to economic and global change, they\u2019re moving fast to adjust planning and forecasting because of the current volatility. Nearly six in 10 (58%) are investing in AI and analytics, and the same percentage are focusing on core finance capabilities like cash and liquidity forecasting. They\u2019re also overcoming concerns about the use of AI in finance processes, recognizing that if they don\u2019t invest in AI, they'll fall behind.\nWhile CFOs use AI to sharpen performance, manage risk and improve forecasting, they\u2019re not going in blind. Sixty-nine percent say that AI legal and reputational concerns pose a moderate or serious risk to their company. And there\u2019s the human aspect of AI \u2014 whether they have the people who can use it effectively. CFOs may be concerned they are missing those AI skills. Half (51%) cite talent retention and skills shortages in key areas among the top 3 barriers to delivering on their finance strategy right now.\nGet access to our interactive data explorer to filter by industry, role and more.\nOur latest PwC Pulse Survey, fielded May 1 to May 8, 2025, surveyed 678 executives and board members from Fortune 1000 and private companies about the current business environment, the risks executives are facing and their company\u2019s strategic plans and priorities. Of the respondent pool, 83 were CFOs."
