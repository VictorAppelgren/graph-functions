  "description": "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook signaled her intention to remain at the central bank, despite calls for her resignation by President Donald Trump over allegations of mortgage fraud.\nCook said she will gather accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts, and that she has no intention of being bullied to step down from her position.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren said the Trump administration \"should not weaponize the federal government to illegally fire independent Fed Board members\", according to her emailed statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President JD Vance said negotiations over ending Russia's war in Ukraine are focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and territory Russia wants to control.\n\nToday's guests: Karen Ward, JPMorgan Asset Management EMEA Chief Market Strategist, Ester Baiget, Novonesis CEO (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > NEWSMAKERS AND MARKET MOVERS, THIS IS \"THE PULSE WITH FRANCINE LACQUA.\" TOM: GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO \"THE PULSE.\" FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR LISA COOK SAYS SHE WILL NOT BE BULLIED INTO STEPPING DOWN FROM THE CENTRAL BANK AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED FOR HER RESIGNATION OVER ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD. FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY DIRECTOR SAYS TRUMP HAS CAUSED TO FIRE COOK. > > SHE LIED IN MY VIEW IN HER STATEMENT TONIGHT BECAUSE SHE SAID THE FIRST TIME SHE HEARD ABOUT WAS THROUGH MY TWEET. SHE DID NOT HEAR ABOUT FOR MY TWEET. SHE DOES NOT FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER. I THINK THIS LADY IS A PROFESSIONAL LIAR. SHE IS GOING TO RESIGN IN MY VIEW IT AND IF SHE DOESN'T, I DO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS CAUSE TO FIRE HER. THAT WILL BE UP TO THE PRESIDENT WHETHER HE DECIDES TO DO THAT OR NOT. TOM: NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST LISA COOK. LET'S BRING IN ROS MATHIESON THE DETAILS ON A LISA COOK, WHO IS DOWN THE FIRING LINE OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WHAT IS BEING ALLEGED? HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS POTENTIALLY? > > IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT IS THE LATEST SALVO BY THIS ADMINISTRATION AGAINST THE FED, CHIPPING AWAY AT THE FED OVER TIME COME OVER JEROME POWELL BUT NOW ALSO LISA COOK. IT IS THE WHITE HOUSE BUT ALSO THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY WHICH IS COMING HEAVILY FOR HER AS YOU JUST HEARD. AND THE ACCUSATION SEEMS TO BE THAT SHE WAS ESSENTIALLY JUGGLING MORTGAGES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES SO YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE ON THE GO AROUND THE SAME TIME THEY ARE OVERLAPPING. IT IS NOT COMPLETELY UNCOMMON PRACTICE BUT OBVIOUSLY, IT IS VERY MUCH INTO A GRAY AREA AND THAT IS THE ACCUSATION LEVELED AGAINST HER. OBVIOUSLY, SHE HAS DENIED THIS AND SAYS SHE STANDS READY TO DEFEND YOURSELF. IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS ALSO THE ACCUSATION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LEVELED OUT SOME OTHER PEOPLE THEY ARE HAVING DISAGREEMENTS WITH. SOME POLITICIANS, INCLUDING LEADERS IN CERTAIN STATES, THEY PUT THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE, TOO, SAYING YOU ARE ACCUSED OF MORTGAGE FRAUD. IT IS NOT SOMETHING COMPLETELY OUT OF THE PLAYBOOK FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS COME OUT AGAIN AND SAID STRONGLY SHE IS GOING TO DEFEND HERSELF. THE OVERARCHING MESSAGE IS THAT THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS NOT GOING TO STOP COMING FROM THE FED. TOM: THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION THAT WAS TO REBUILD THE FEDERAL RESERVE. SO HOW SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT? > > IF THEY CAN LOOSEN UP ANOTHER VACANCY ON THE FED, THAT ENABLES THIS ADMINISTRATION TO REBUILD THE FED IN THEIR OWN IMAGE IN WAY, PERHAPS WITH MORE LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS. THEY HAVE QUITE A FEW BALLS IN THE AIR ALREADY. YOU HAVE POINT WHERE JEROME POWELL'S TERM WILL END, STOP THE IDEA OF FIRING HIM OR THE POSSIBILITY OF TRYING TO DO SO. BUT THEY ARE NOT STOPPING CRITICIZING HIM EITHER WAY. WE HAVE GOT THE TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT AT THE MOMENT FOR ADRIANA KUGLER WHO IS IN UNTIL JANUARY AND THAT GIVES THEM TIME TO MAP OUT WHO THEY WOULD PUT IN PROPERLY FOR THAT VACANCY POTENTIALLY. THERE ARE A LOT OF NAMES IN THE AIR WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO WITHIN THE FED ITSELF AND PERHAPS SOME FED OFFICIALS WHO THEY SEE IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO DONALD TRUMP'S THINKING, ESPECIALLY ON INTEREST RATES. WHAT HE COULD DO IS ENABLE THEM TO BUILD THE BED INTO SOMETHING THEY WANT TO SOME EXTENT -- BUILD THE FED INTO SOMETHING THEY WANT. YOU SEE THAT IT INSTITUTIONS ACROSS AMERICA, NOT JUST THE CENTRAL BANK. IT IS LOOKING AT PORTS AND IMPORTANT PART OF THE MACHINERY FOR THE U.S.. ARE THEY LOOKING TO PUT IN PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE MORE CONDUCIVE TO THEIR OWN THINKING? TOM: ROS MATHIESON, THANK YOU SO MUCH. U.S. MEGA CAPS DRAGGING DOWN THE NASDAQ DESPITE A BOUNCE OFF SESSION LOWS. WE DID SEE A BIT OF A DIP YESTERDAY. IT SEEMS MARKETS ARE IN THE WAIT AND SEE MODE AHEAD OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S JACKSON HOLE MEETING. JOINING ME NOW IS KAREN WARD OF JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT. HIS JAY POWELL THE NEXT CATALYST FOR THESE MARKETS? > > QUITE POSSIBLY. I THINK THE MARKET IS EXPECTING JAY POWELL TO DO A CONTINUAL GOOD JOB AS HE HAS BEEN DOING OF GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT, AND MAKING ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND IS NOISE. THEY ARE AN INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK AND WILL SET POLICY ACCORDING TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY. BUT HE IS IN HIS SAFE SPACE. HE HAS A CENTRAL BANKERS AROUND HIM. THE TOPIC OF THE CONFERENCE IS THE LABOR MARKET. I THINK REALLY LAYING OUT THAT DEMAND IS WEAKENING FOR LABOR IN THE U.S. ECONOMY, BUT THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT ALSO HAPPENING ON THE SUPPLY SIDE BECAUSE OF MIGRATION AND THEREFORE THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION AND SECOND ROUND PRESSURES SHOULD WE GET A BUMP IN HEADLINE INFLATION, WHICH SEEMS LIKELY AFTER THE TARIFFS. I THINK THAT WOULD GET MARKETS PRETTY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURRENT PRICING BECAUSE THAT IS THE PART OF MARKETS AT THE MOMENT THAT CONCERNS ME. THERE ARE A LOT OF RATE CUTS FOR THE FED PRICE. WE STILL HAVE OVER 100 BASIS POINTS IN THE COMING YEAR. THAT DOES NOT SIT WITH HOW IS HE THE OUTLOOK TO THE U.S. ECONOMY. TOM: THE MARKET COME ARE THEY OVER THEIR SKIS IN TERMS OF THE PRICE OF SEPTEMBER? > > QUITE POSSIBLY. ALL IT IS GOING TO TAKE IS A BIT OF STICKINESS IN INFLATION AND A LABOR MARKET PRINT WHICH SHOWS IT IS NOT FALLING OFF A CLIFF FOR THE MARKET TO SAY, HANG ON, MAYBE ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT -- THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE A PARTICULARLY PREEMPTIVE FED. FOR MARKETS, THAT IS IMPORTANT. MARKETS LOVE PREEMPTIVE CENTRAL BANKS, NOT REACTIVE BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE REACTIVE, USUALLY, DOWNTURNS HAVE ALREADY GATHERED MOMENTUM. I THINK IT COULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT MEETING. TOM: DO YOU WORRY ABOUT FED INDEPENDENCE? > > YEAH, I WAS IT AND LISTENING TO ROS MATHIESON SPEAKING AND WHAT WAS GOING IN THE BACK OF MY MIND WAS DOLLAR, DOLLAR, DOLLAR. EVERYTHING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, ALL OF THESE CHECKS AND BALANCES ON THE U.S. SYSTEM IS ALL -- IT UNDERPINS ITS RESERVE CURRENCY STATUS. EVERYTHING THAT UNDERPINS WHY GLOBAL INVESTORS FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS WANTED TO PARK THEIR MONEY IN U.S. ASSETS READ THIS IS CENTRAL TO THAT. PICKING AWAY AT GLOBAL INVESTORS PERCEPTIONS OF WHETHER THE FED CAN SAFEGUARD PRESERVE THAT VALUE OF THE DOLLAR, WE HAVE TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF THAT. I THINK AS INVESTORS, EVEN IF WHAT TRANSPIRES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ENDS UP IN A FEDERAL RESERVE MORE WILLING TO CUT SHORT RATES, WHAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE LONG END AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE DOLLAR. OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. INVESTMENT, THAT IS WHERE ANY PERCEPTION THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE POLICIES GOING TO SHOW UP. TOM: I WAS THINKING ABOUT HUNGARY AND TURKEY AND HOW THOSE INSTITUTIONS WILL BE MOLDED IN THE LIKES OF EROGAN AND ORBAN. AS YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THAT TIES INTO THE ROTATION TRADE OUT OF U.S. EQUITIES INTO EUROPE, HAS BEEN SUCH A FRIEND AND CENTRAL TRAIT EARLIER IN THE YEAR, IT SEEMS TO HAVE FADED ON THE BACK OF STRONG EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY WITH TECH. WHERE ARE WE IN THAT STORY? > > I STILL THINK WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING. IF I LOOK AT VALUATIONS, TO ME IT STILL SUGGESTS -- THEY'RE STILL A PESSIMISM ABOUT EUROPE GENERALLY. ALTHOUGH, THE VALUATION DISCOUNT HAS CLOSED SLIGHTLY, IT IS STILL BEYOND WHAT IS NORMAL. AND SO I THINK THAT RELATIVE OPTIMISM ABOUT THE U.S. PESSIMISM IS -- ABOUT EUROPE IS STILL THERE. I THINK ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD, IT IS COMING FROM BOTH SIDES FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IN THE U.S., TECH IS IT -- IT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. I'M STILL A LITTLE NERVOUS WE HAVE NOT REALLY GONE THROUGH THE REAL TECH TEST YET. THESE COMPANIES ARE INVESTING MASSIVELY IN THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BUT THE QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH ARE THEY GOING TO BE IN DEMAND AND AT WHAT PRICE IN THE BROADER ECONOMY? IT IS QUITE RARE HISTORICALLY TO SEE A DOWNTURN BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY AND TECH EARNINGS NOT DECLINE. SO THERE ARE A FEW RISKS AROUND THAT. ON THE EUROPE STORY, WE HAVE JUST SEEN THE COMPOSITE PMI THIS MORNING. I THINK WE ARE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF EUROPE'S RECOVERY. WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE GERMAN FISCAL MONEY HAD THE ECONOMY YET, THE CONSUMER IS JUST WAKING UP TO LOWER INTEREST RATES. THEY'VE GOT ALL THOSE SAVINGS THEY CAN GO OUT AND SPEND. I THINK THE GROWTH DIFFERENTIAL IS GOING TO LOOK INCREASINGLY APPEALING. AFTER A DECADE OF EUROPE'S UNDERPERFORMING, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF SKEPTICISM, STILL A LOT OF MONEY TO MOVE. TOM: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN -- YOU HAVE TOUCHED ON THIS PARTLY, BUT IN TERMS OF THE MOVES WE HAVE SEEN EUROPE AND WHAT IS DRIVEN THE GROWTH IN THE UPSIDE TODAY -- YOUR TO DATE HAS BEEN VALUE STOCKS AND IN THE U.S. IT HAS BEEN GROWTH. THIS IS A HEDGE BY INVESTORS? IS IT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS? HOW DO WE MAKE SENSE OF THAT KIND OF SPLIT VIEW ON THE STOCK STORY REGIONALLY? > > IN EUROPE -- AS YOU SAY, VALUE AND SMALL-CAP TRADE THE SMALL-CAP COME INTEREST RATES HAVE COME DOWN. SMALL-CAP IS PRETTY INTEREST SENSITIVE, INTERESTS HAVE HALVED. EUROPE SMALL-CAP IS OFTEN AN EXCITING AREA OF THE MARKET. THAT HAS BEEN REVITALIZED. VALUE IS ALL PART OF JUSTICE REASSESSMENT THAT MAY BE EUROPE IS STUCK IN THE RUT IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST DECADE. ACTUALLY, THIS CONFRONTATION FROM RUSSIA AND FROM TRUMP HAS GALVANIZED THE REGION INTO SOME GOOD POLICY. MAYBE WE ARE DISCOUNTING SOME OF THE SECTORS TOO HEAVILY. TECH, AS I'VE ALREADY EXPLAINED ON THE U.S. SIDE, WE ARE GOING TO SEE -- I AM NOT PESSIMISTIC ON TECH, I JUST THINK THERE A VERY HIGH EXPECTATION ON QUITE HOW EASY THE TRANSITION FROM INVESTING TO SELLING THE PRODUCT IS GOING TO BE. USUALLY, HISTORICALLY, IT IS NEVER A STRAIGHT LINE. IN AN ID COMING OUT THE SURVEY IS SOME DATA SUGGESTING THE ROI IS STILL A PIECE MISSING IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS AROUND AI AND ADOPTION AROUND BUSINESSES AND BY BUSINESSES. THE FTSE 100, FRESH RECORD YESTERDAY. PART OF THAT SEEMS TO BE IT DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF EXPOSURE TO CHIPS OR AI. IS OUR FURTHER TO RUN FOR U.K. BIG CAPS STOCKS IN THE FTSE 100 OR IS IT LOOKING AT ILLUSTRATIONS AT THIS POINT? > > U.K. BENCHMARK IS HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD ENERGY AND MINING. ENERGY, PARTLY BECAUSE OF POLITICAL FACTORS, BUT ACTUALLY PARTLY JUST THE AI STORY ITSELF. WE KNOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE INCREDIBLY HUNGRY. THAT IS UNDERPINNING ENERGY PRICES. SO THE FTSE TENDS TO GO WITH IT. IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE SAID THAT WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT HEDGING OUR CELL FIRMS OF COMMODITY RISK OR FROM INFLATION RISK, ACTUALLY THE U.K. BENCHMARK IS A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO BE. IF YOU GO BACK TO 2022 WHEN MOST MARKETS WERE DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION, U.K. BENCHMARK WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WAS UP. I THINK IT IS PART OF THAT INFLATION NARRATIVE WERE ACTUALLY THE U.K. MARKET WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF RESILIENCE. TOM: KAREN WARD, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. INVESTORS SHOULD BE READY. INFLATION SURPRISES AT THE ROTATION FROM U.S. TO EUROPEAN EQUITIES HAS FURTHER TO RUN. COMING UP, RUSSIA DEMANDS A ROLE IN THE SECURITY PLAN FOR UKRAINE AND SAYS CHINA NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED, TOO. DETAILS ARE NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" \u266a TOM: THE CONVERSATIONS THAT MATTER, THE INSIGHT YOU NEED, THIS IS \"THE PULSE.\" U.S. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE SAYS NEGOTIATIONS OVER ENDING RUSSIA'S WAR IN UKRAINE ARE FOCUSED ON SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE AND TERRITORY THAT RUSSIA WANTS TO CONTROL. SPEAKING TO FOX NEWS ABOUT -- VANCE I DID THIS WOULD INCLUDE UKRAINIAN TERRITORY THAT RUSSIA IS NOT AT THIS POINT OCCUPYING. VICE PRES. VANCE: WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS. WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE PRESIDENT TELLS ME THAT IS ALL THE TIME, YOU CAN NEVER SAY WITH CERTAINTY WHAT THE OUTCOME THE SITUATION IS GOING TO BE. BUT WE NOW HAVE THE RUSSIANS TALKING TO THE UKRAINIANS. THEY ARE TALKING DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY ON EACH SIDE TO STOP THE FIGHTING IS NOT THE KILLING. WE HAVE MADE MORE PROGRESS IN THREE-MONTH ON THE COUNTRY, IN THREE YEARS IN STOPPING THE CONFLICT. I THINK IT IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL SOMEBODY. TOM: FOR MORE, A RUSSIAN ECONOMY GOVERNMENT COVERAGE TONY JOINS ME. WHAT TERMS OF SECURITY GUARANTEES ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR UKRAINE AND POTENTIALLY RUSSIA'S OWN INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECURITY GUARANTEES? > > YES, SO VICE PRESIDENT VANCE'S COMMONS, WHILE HE INTENDED IN TERMS OF SECURITY GUARANTEES, TERRITORY. RUSSIA IS ALSO CLOUDING THE HORIZON SOMEWHAT BY TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR UKRAINE AND ALSO POTENTIALLY INVOLVING CHINA AS WELL AS THE UNITED NATIONS FIVE POWERS. EUROPEAN POWERS ON TOP OF THAT ARE ALSO TRYING TO FORGE SOME KIND OF NATO-LIGHT AGREEMENT THAT WAS SET OUT WHAT KIND OF SECURITY DEFENSE PROVISION THEY WOULD MAKE IN THE EVENT UKRAINE GETS ATTACKED IN THE FUTURE. VERY COMPLICATED PICTURE, LOTS OF MOVING PARTS. TOM: TONY, IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE AT SOME LEVELS TO CONSIDER RUSSIA IS SUGGESTING IT HAS A ROLE IN THE SECURITY GUARANTEE WHICH WOULD INVOLVE SECURING YOUR CRANE AGAINST ULTIMATELY RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV, IS THIS AN ATTEMPT BY RUSSIA TO POUR COLD WATER ON THE MODEST OPTIMISM THAT IS COME OUT SINCE THIS MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE? > > IN SOME WAYS IT IS. IT IS TO UNDERLINE THE DIFFICULTY REALLY OF TRYING TO COME TO A SOLUTION TO THIS WAR. BUT IT IS ALSO PART OF HOW RUSSIA VIEWS THE CONFLICT. IN MANY WAYS, THEY DON'T VIEW IT SIMPLY AS A CONFRONTATION WITH UKRAINE, CONFLICT AND WAR WITH UKRAINE. PUTIN HAS ALWAYS VIEWED IT IN MANY WAYS AS A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE WEST, WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN UKRAINE. RUSSIA IS TRYING TO USE THIS MOMENT TO ESTABLISH SOME SORT OF BROADER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE IN WHICH IT WOULD HAVE A ROLE AND UKRAINE SECURITY WOULD FALL PART OF THAT SECURITY ARCHITECTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ARGUE FOR WHEN YOU ARE THE ONE COMMITTING THE INVASION AND COMMITTING THE AGGRESSION BECAUSE UKRAINE WAS TO BE SURE IT WILL BE PROTECTED IN THE FUTURE JUST AGAINST RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. IT IS ALL PART OF A RATHER COMPLICATED CHESS GAME BETWEEN THE KREMLIN AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND NATO ON ONE SIDE WITH UKRAINE IN THE MIDDLE. TOM: WE NEED CLOSE TO THIS MUCH TOUTED MEETING BETWEEN PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY? > > ZELENSKYY YESTERDAY SAID HE IS WILLING TO MEET PUTIN AND SAID IT SHOULD BE A NEUTRAL EUROPE. PUTIN HAS GIVEN NO SIGN HE IS READY TO MEET ZELENSKYY. HE IS ALREADY SAID THAT SHE HAS ALREADY SAID HE WILL DO BUT THERE HAS TO BE AN AGREEMENT ON THE TABLE AND THAT IS DONE ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. TOM: TONY, THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE. TO ISRAEL WHICH IS REPORTING -- REPORTED TO APPROVE NEW SETTLEMENTS IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK WHILE IS TROOPS HAVE NOW REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF GAZA CITY. THE ISRAELI MILITARY CALLED UP AROUND 60 CUSTOMER RESERVE SOLDIERS TO JOIN THE WAR AGAINST HAMAS, SIGN THE PREPARATIONS ARE UNDERWAY FOR A STEPPED-UP OFFENSES DESPITE ONGOING CASH OFFENSIVE DESPITE ONGOING TALKS ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE. TECHNOLOGY, MICROSOFT LIMITING CHINESE COMPANIES ACCESS TO EARLY WARNINGS ABOUT FLAWS IN HIS TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN WHETHER A LEAK LED TO VULNERABILITIES IN A SHAREPOINT SOFTWARE BEING EXPLOITED. MICROSOFT HAS BLAMED STATE-SPONSORED ACTORS IN CHINA FOR A SERIES OF SHAREPOINT HACKS THAT AFFECTED HUNDREDS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ANOTHER BUSY WEEK OF EARNINGS ESTATE SIDE WITH RETAIL STOCKS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. DISAPPOINTING SALES FROM TARGET YESTERDAY. TODAY, A FRONT AND CENTER IS WALMART ON DECK, BIGGEST RETAILER -- AT LEAST THE BIGGEST GROCER IN THE U.S. PRAYED FOR MORE, LET US BRING IN JENNIFER FOR WHAT TO EXPECT. WHAT ARE WE LEARNING SO FAR ABOUT THIS SECTOR AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS RESILIENCE AMONGST U.S. CONSUMER WE'RE STARTING TO GET QUESTION MARKS ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET AND MAYBE A LITTLE SOFTENING? > > WE ARE RELEASING SOME OF THE HOLES IN SOME OF THE RETAIL BUSINESS MODELS. I THINK IF WE WERE TO TAKE ONE MESSAGE FROM THE U.S. RETAIL EARNINGS SO FAR, IT IS A GOOD TIME TO BE A DISCOUNT RETAILER. CUSTOMERS ARE SHOPPING FOR VALUE . SOME OF THE WINTER SO FAR, T.J. MAXX FOR EXAMPLE RAISING THEIR FULL-YEAR EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE WE HAD THAT IS THANKS TO ITS VALUE PROPOSITION. ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE, THERE IS TARGET. BIG NEWS COMING OUT YESTERDAY THAT IT IS REPLACING ITS CEO AS IT HAS TRIED TO TURBOCHARGE ITS TURNAROUND. IT IS HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY WITH PRICE RISES, TARIFF INDUCED PRICE RISES. LOOKING AT A WALMART, SEEN A SLIGHTLY MORE RESILIENT. PROBABLY MORE ABLE TO WEATHER THE STORMS BETTER THAN ITS RIVALS. ANALYSTS HAVE A PRETTY POSITIVE READ ON THE RETAIL SO FAR. TOM: TO BE MORE RESILIENCE AMONGST THE WALMART NUMBERS WE GET LATER TODAY. YOU TOUCHED ON TARIFFS. WHAT IS OUR BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TARIFF IMPACT? THERE IS A RELUCTANCE AFTER APRIL FOR COMPANIES TO PASS ON HIGHER PRICES. CONCERNED ABOUT BEING TARGETED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP THREE IT IS THAT STARTING TO CHANGE? ARE PRICES GOING UP? > > ALL RETAILERS ARE VERY CAUTIOUS TO SAY MUCH ABOUT TARIFFS AT THE MOMENT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SPOOK INVESTORS. ESTEE LAUDER, FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHLIGHTING 00 MILLION HIT TO PROFITABILITY FROM TARIFFS. WE ARE SEEING SOME RETAILERS ALREADY RAISE PRICES. WALMART IN Q1 FOR EXAMPLE RAISING SOME PRICES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS INCLUDING BABY PRODUCTS. TARGET AS WELL IN THE EARNINGS SAYING THEY WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE LOWER PRICES WITH SUPPLIERS, SO THERE REALLY HAVING TO TRY TO MANAGE THOSE COSTS BEFORE PASSING THEM ON TO THE CONSUMER. WE ARE SEEING DIFFERENT WAYS -- T.J. MAXX, FOR EXAMPLE, AS WELL, THEY ARE AN INTERESTING CASE BECAUSE THEY ARE A BIT MORE SHIELDED. THEIR BUSINESS MODEL MEANS THEY BUY EXCESS INVENTORY FROM OTHER BUSINESSES. SO A LOT OF THOSE FEES ARE ALREADY COVERED BY THOSE BUSINESSES. WE ARE RELEASING THE DIFFERENCES IN HOW RETAILERS ARE SHOULDERING THOSE COSTS. TOM: JENNIFER, THANK YOU SO MUCH, WHAT A GREAT SET UP AND WHAT TO THINK ABOUT WITHOUT WALMART EARNINGS UP FRONT AND WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE LIKES OF TARGET. THANK YOU. TO THE AUTO SECTOR, FOR IS LOOKING TO DEVELOP A SUPERCAR FOR OFF-ROAD RACING AS A FOLLOW-UP TO ITS NEW $325,000 MUSTANG GT SPORTS CAR. THE CEO SAYS HE SEES THE VEHICLE AS A DIRT LOVING HIGH-PERFORMANCE MACHINE THAT COULD COMPETE IN THE DAKAR RALLY. > > I AM VERY INTERESTED. THE ON ROAD PERFORMANCE HIERARCHY IS VERY SIMPLE TO SEE AND THE VERY TOP IS OVERSERVED, IN MY OPINION. NO ONE HAS EVER DONE IN OFF-ROAD SUPERCAR. TOM: AND AFTER A MONTH-LONG HIRING SPREE, META HAS PAUSED SOME HERRING WHILE IT DOES \"PLANNING AND FORECASTING.\" IT COMES AS ITS LATEST RESTRUCTURING OF ITS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION WHICH WILL NOW BE SPLIT INTO FOUR DISTINCT TEAMS TO BETTER CAPITALIZE ON NEW TALENT. OPENAI SAYS IT COULD EVENTUALLY OFFER A SERVICE WHEREBY IT HELPS OTHER BUSINESSES TO TAP INTO THE DATA CENTERS AND PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR AI. THE SERVICE COULD HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE COMPANIES IMMENSE COSTS AND WOULD BE LOOSELY BASED ON SUCCESS AMAZON HAD IN RENTING OUT ITS SPARE CLOUD COMPUTING CAPACITY. SUCCESS, OF COURSE, AMAZON CONTINUES TO SEE. LET'S CHECK IT ON THE MARKETS AS WE LEAD UP TO REALLY THE MARKET MOVING SET PIECE OF THE WEEK, WHICH IS JACKSON HOLE JAY POWELL'S SPEECH TOMORROW ON FRIDAY. EUROPEAN STOCKS A BIT SOFTER. THE DOCS IN GERMANY DROPPING FIVE POINTS. -- THE DAX IN GERMANY DROPPING AFTER FIVE POINTS. U.K. STOCKS UP. STAY WITH US. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" \u266a TOM: GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO \"THE PULSE.\" THESE ARE YOUR TOP STORIES. FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK SAYS SHE WILL NOT BE BULLIED INTO STEPPING DOWN AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP DEMANDED HER RESIGNATION OVER ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD. TECH STOCKS STABILIZE AFTER A TWO DAY SELLOFF AS MARKETS TREAD CAUTIOUSLY AHEAD OF JEROME POWELL'S SPEECH IN JACKSON HOLE TOMORROW. THE U.S. SAYS RUSSIA WANTS UKRAINIAN TERRITORY IT DOES NOT YET CONTROL AS MOSCOW PUSHES FOR A ROLE IN THE SECURITY PLAN FOR UKRAINE. LET'S CHECK IN ON GILTS, CROSSING THE TERMINAL RIGHT NOW AROUND SERVICES AND COMPOSITE PMI OUT OF THE U.K. COME AUGUST SERVICES PMI RISING TO 53.6. THAT IS A PRETTY STRONG NUMBER. THE FORECAST HAD BEEN FOR 54.8. CONVINCINGLY AN EXPANSIONARY TERRITORY. THE FORECAST HAD BEEN FOR 51.6. THIS ON THE BACK OF THE LATEST GDP DATA THAT WE GOT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT SUGGESTED SLIGHTLY MORE STRENGTH IN THE U.K. ECONOMY SOME HAD EXPECTED. THE GILT USING YIELDS -- UP. THE TENURE AT 4.69. VERY MODEST PRESSURE SELLING YOUR SING THAT REFLECTED IN THE SOVEREIGN DEBT OF FRANCE AND GERMANY. IT IS NOT JUST THE U.K. WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A BIT OF SELLING WHEN IT COMES TO SOVEREIGN DEBT. YIELDS UP AROUND TWO BASIS POINTS ON THE FRONT AND AT 3.94. THE U.K. CHANCELLOR WILL BE HEADING INTO THE AUTUMN ON THE FISCAL ROPES. WE HAVE SAID THAT BEFORE. RACPLUGGING A 10,000,000 POUND WHOLE JUST FOR ONE YEAR. JOHN JOINTS ME NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. YOU FOLLOW THIS CLOSELY. WHAT KIND OF CHANGES SHOULD WE BE BRACED FOR? > > THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS CLASSIC AUGUST NEWS STORIES. THERE'S A LOT OF KITE FLYING GOING ON WHICH IS FOR OTHER REASONS. ON MONDAY WE GOT A REPORT THAT CHANCELLOR WAS LOOKING AT REFORMING TAX. ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX LIKE A SAILORS TAX. A GOOD IDEA BUT IT IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND QUITE EASY TO MESS UP READ TREASURY PUSHBACK. ON TUESDAY, WE ARE HEARING LOOKING AT THE MOMENT IF YOU OWN A HOME AND LIVE IN IT, GET AN EXEMPTION WHEN YOU SELL IT FOR CAPITAL GAINS TAX. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS SCRAPPING THAT EXEMPTION ON PEOPLE. WHEN YOU SAY 1.5 ONE MILLION PLUS HOUSE, LEVEL OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX. IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY WAY TO RAISE MONEY AND YOU CAN ALSO TARGET AS A MENTION TAX OR TAX ON THE RICH, TALKING ABOUT WORKING PEOPLE, IT IS RIFE WITH POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER. THE FIRST THING THAT WILL HAPPEN IF CAPITAL GAINS TAX ISN'T PAUSED, THE TORIES AND REFORM FROM 2020 -- WHY WOULD YOU? YOU CAN AVOID CAPITAL GAINS ON IT SIMPLY BY WAITING. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL FLY. IF THEY DO, I DON'T THINK THEY WILL RAISE THE KIND OF MONEY THEY HOPE THEY WILL. TOM: WHAT ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS? WHAT ELSE -- WHAT ARE THE OTHER LEVERS THAT CHANCELLOR COULD REACH FOR? SHE HAS TO DO SOMETHING. > > THAT IS A PROBLEM, SHE HAS ROLLED OUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE EASILY. -- SHE HAS RULED OUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE EASILY. IT ACCOUNTS BASICALLY FOR 75% OF THE U.K. TAX SO THAT LEAVES YOU WITH 25% OF SOMEWHAT MORE RANDOM TAXES AND TAX RELIEF. IF YOU MESS ABOUT WITH ANY OF THOSE, THEN EVERYONE'S FINANCIAL PLAN IS COMPLETELY MESSED UP. WE HAVE CONSTANT RUMORS AND HAVE DONE FROM DECADES THAT PENSION RELIEF IS GOING TO BE CHANGED IN SOME WAY. AS SOON AS YOU -- AS SOON AS YOU PULL IN ANY OF THE FEDS OF THAT, IS SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLICATED AND AT BEST YOU COULD LAUNCH MAY BE A REVIEW, REPORT OF THE BUDGET AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS PROPERLY. CERTAINLY, -- IT IS A TERRIBLE TAX. IT COULD MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT IF THEY GET RID OF IT. DOING WHAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING, DISASTER TO THE MARKET AS A WHOLE. IT ALREADY IS NOT DOING WELL. YEAH, THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS YOU CAN LOOK AT BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE SHE HAS BOXED HERSELF IN -- NATIONAL INSURANCE CUTS THE TORY STATE AT THE END -- TORIES NEED, A BEAR TRAP FOR LABOR TO FALL INTO. THEY HAVE FALLEN INTO IT. THE OTHER OPTION IS YOU CAN LOOK AT A FISCAL BOOM. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD STORY TO TELL MARKETS THAT WHY YOU HAVE DECIDED IT IS NO LONGER TENABLE, THEN I DON'T THINK -- TOM: LEFT-WING MEMBERS OF THE LABOUR PARTY ARE PUSHING FOR, ISN'T IT? > > THE PROBLEM IS YET TO TELL A GOOD STORY. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. IT IS TOO RESTRICTIVE AT THE MOMENT AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE -- PROMOTE GROWTH. IT ACTUALLY SAID WE ARE NOT DOING IT AND SPEND A LOT OF MONEY, THE GILT MARKET WOULD BE LESS KEEN ON THAT. TOM: FANTASTIC ON THE TIGHT ROPE THIS CHANCELLOR HAS TO WALK. THE AUTHOR BLOOMBERG'S NEWSLETTER. YOU CAN GET IT ON BLOOMBERG.COM AND AT THE U.K. GOVERNMENT PREPARING TO TAKE CONTROL OF STEELWORKS SHOULD THEY FALL INTO LIQUIDATION. PART OF THE LIBERTY STEEL GROUP TOLD A LONDON COURT THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE PREPARING TO APPOINT SPECIAL MANAGERS IN THE EVENT STEEL OPERATIONS ARE WOUND UP READ IT WOULD BE THE SECOND TIME THE GOVERNMENT HAS INTERVENED IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY AFTER TOOK OVER THE BRITISH STEEL PLANT EARLIER THIS YEAR. DOES LOYALTY PAY? IF YOU ASK A MEMBER OF GEN Z, THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY NOT. ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY CONDUCTED BY INTUIT CREDIT KARMA , BLOOMBERG, MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE MULTIPLE CURRENT ACCOUNTS TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY THESE DAYS. WE NEED A SURVEY FOR THAT? LET'S GET MORE FROM ANNA. I'M BEING FLIPPANT. I COULD DO AN UNSCIENTIFIC POLL OF YOUNGER FRIENDS OF MINE AND THEY ALL HAVE 3, 4, FIVE DIFFERENT BANKING -- WHY IS THIS POTENTIALLY A PROBLEM PARTICULARLY FOR THE INCUMBENT BANKS? > > THANKS EARN SO MUCH MONEY AND ACQUIRING CUSTOMERS, AND EVEN MORE NOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME CHOICE. TRADITIONALLY, MAKE MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO SELL THE MORE PROFITABLE SERVICES LIKE LOANS. IF THEY'RE NOT STICKING AROUND, THEY NEVER GET TO THE THRESHOLD WHERE THEY ARE MAKING YOU MONEY. THAT IS BECOMING MORE OF A CONCERN WITH GEN Z BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPOKE TO SOME WHO HAVE MADE 2800 POUNDS JUST OPENING BANK ACCOUNTS FROM INCENTIVES AND HAD OVER -- TOM: JUST BY OPENING BANK ACCOUNTS? > > YEAH, AND YET IT DOESN'T BANK ACCOUNTS. YOU'RE SAYING LOYALTY DOESN'T PAY OFF AND HAS A TIKTOK ACCOUNT WHERE HE IS TEACHING OTHERS HOW TO MAKE MONEY FROM INCENTIVES. IT IS STARTING TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR BOTH FINTECH BANKS AND THE BIGGER BANKS. IT TOM: HOW IS THE INTEREST HE RESPONDING? > > THEY ARE LAUNCHING MORE INCENTIVES AND ONES WHERE THEY PAY YOU IF YOU STICK AROUND. AN INCENTIVE IF YOU STAY FOR A YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE. TOM: YOU GET PAID FOR BEING A CUSTOMER. IN THE U.S. WITH THE OPEN ACCOUNT, HAVE TO PAY BUT IN THE U.K., YOU GET PAID. > > OR IF YOUR REFERRING FRIENDS. WE SAW GEN Z IS MORE INCLINED TO JOIN THE BANK IF THEY HAVE A FRIEND REFERRAL. SOME OTHERS ARE JUST LEANING IN AND SIGN, KNOW WHAT? WE CAN'T GET THEM TO STICK AROUND ON ONE APP, LET'S OPEN MULTIPLE BECAUSE THEY LIKED EASE OF USE. WE WILL JUST LEAN INTO IT OR WE WILL LET THEM STAY IN OUR ECOSYSTEM BUT GET SERVICES FROM OTHER PEOPLE. TOM: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CRAZIEST PROMOTIONS YOU'VE COME ACROSS? > > WE SPOKE TO NATIONWIDE AND THEY TOOK OVER FRIED CHICKEN SHOP LAST YEAR AND GOT INFLUENCERS AND THEY WERE PAYING FOR DELIVERY, BONUSES. THEY GAVE AROUND 200 POUNDS I THINK IT WAS TO SPEND ON FOOD DELIVERY. TOM: WHEN ASKED ABOUT CRAZY, I DID NOT EXPECT FRENCH ABOUT NATIONWIDE. THERE YOU GO. AS THEY TRY TO RESPOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT REPORTING WAS ON THE TERMINAL AND BLOOMBERG.COM. THE LACK OF LOYALTY AMONGST GEN Z. THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO SWITCH FOCUS AND TALK ABOUT WEALTH BUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SCALE BECAUSE AFRICA'S RICHEST PERSON HAS BUILT A $20 BILLION OIL REFINERY IN NIGERIA, BIGGER THAN ANY IN EUROPE. CRITIC'S ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER HIS DOMINANCE WILL TRULY BENEFIT THE NATION ARE MAINLY JUST ENRICH HIMSELF AS HE SEEMS TO BAN FOREIGN COMPETITION. JOINING US MORE IS JENNIFER WHO IS ACROSS THIS STORY FOR US. WHO IS DAN CODY? HOW DID HE BECOME SO WEALTHY AND WHY IS THIS REFINERY SO IMPORTANT AND POTENTIALLY NIGERIA ITSELF? > > FOR MANY PEOPLE HE SERVES A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT EMOTIONS BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, HE MADE HIS FIRST BILLION AND HIS CEMENT BUSINESS BUT HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN IN THE COMMODITY SPACE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. HE HAS TRADED THINGS LIKE COCOA AND OTHER -- COCOA, COTTON, CASHEW NUTS, EVEN SESAME SEEDS. THE FOCUS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN ON THIS OIL REFINERY THAT YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING ABOUT. THE REASON IS A BIT TWOFOLD. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT NIGERIA, IT IS AFRICA'S BIGGEST OIL PRODUCER, ALSO THE MOST POPULOUS OPEC NATION AND YET IT HAS SPENT THE BULK OF THE PAST FEW YEARS AND DECADES HAVING TO EXPORT CRUDE TO EUROPE AND OTHER PLACES AND ALSO -- AND THEN IMPORT IT BACK AS A REFINED PRODUCT. THAT HAS CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, NOT JUST THAT, IT IS ALSO A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THE SUBSIDIES AND CORRUPTION. THE FACT THAT NOW THERE IS THIS REFINERY IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND DANGOTE. YOU MENTIONED $20 BILLION. IT TOOK HIM NEARLY 11 YEARS TO ACTUALLY GET THIS UP AND RUNNING. AS OUR BLOOMBERG BIG TECH REALLY DIGS INTO IT COME THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DECADES WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING NIGERIA BEING ABLE TO EXPORT REFINED PRODUCTS IN A WAY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE. MANY PEOPLE, AS YOU JUST MENTIONING, CRITICS ARE WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS GOING TO BE A LASTING CHANGE FOR THIS ECONOMY AND WHETHER OR NOT OIL SALES ARE REALLY GOING TO BE A BOOST FOR THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY OR WHETHER OR NOT IT IS JUST GOING TO KEEP MAKING DANGOTE MORE WEALTHY THAN HE ACTUALLY IS. A BIT OF A STAT, STATS, IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS, HIS WEALTH HAS GONE UP BILLION FOR $28 BILLION. THIS IS AN INTO THE EMPIRE HE ALREADY HAD. STILL AFFECTING ONE OF THE MOST OR THE MOST POPULIST OPEC PRODUCER. TOM: CERTAINLY. AND THE CHANGES ARE THERE ANY IS MADE THIS MOVEMENT FROM THIS INVESTMENT. WHAT IS NEXT, WHAT IS THE FUTURE LOOKING LIKE FOR DANGOTE HIMSELF? > > THERE'S STILL A LOT THIS REFINERY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO GET THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY THAT DANGOTE SEES AND EVEN THAT LOCAL PRODUCERS ARE HOPING TO SEE. THERE IS QUITE A BIT WE ARE WAITING FOR IN TERMS OF THIS REFINERY. DANGOTE HIMSELF, I WAS MENTIONING EARLIER, WE DID HEAR THE FIRST BIT OF HIS BILLIONS IN WEALTH DID COME FROM HIS CEMENT BUSINESS. HE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO BE RETIRING FROM THE CHAIRMANSHIP ROLE. INSTEAD THEY ARE POINTING -- APPOINTING A FORMER --DANGOTE'S EMPIRE DOESN'T STOP THERE. HE HAS BEEN IN THE COMMODITY BUSINESS FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE WE HAD ECS FERTILIZERS POTENTIALLY BEING THE NEXT BOON FOR THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY. HE ALSO IS LOOKING AT A DEEP SEAPORT NIGERIA. THIS IS NOT THE LAST OF DANGOTE, THIS REFINERY. AS HE SAYS, HE WANTS AFRICA TO BE INDUSTRIALIZED AND TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND EXPORT THEIR GOODS AND GET THE VALUE ADD THAT MANY LEADERS TALK ABOUT DAY IN AND DAY OUT. TOM: WELL, THAT AMBITION IS STILL THEREFORE DANGOTE. THANK YOU. YOU CAN CATCH MORE OF JENNIFER IN THE NEXT EDITION OF NEXT AFRICA ON FRIDAY. COMING UP, TO THE EARNINGS STORY AND THIS TIME SHARES OF NOVONESIS SLUMPING, ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSERS IN THE SESSION SO FAR AFTER THE COMPANY TRIMS ITS REVENUE FORECAST, MERCHANTS NOT AS PUNCHY IN TERMS OF THE OUTLOOK AS SOME HAD HOPED FOR. WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE CEO NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" \u266a TOM: OAKTREE CAPITAL CO-CHAIR, U.S. BUBBLE. MARK SPOKE ABOUT HIS CONCERNS OVER RISING VALUATIONS AND INVESTOR COMPLACENCY. > > THIS IS ALL JUST FEELING AND OPINION. NONE OF THIS IS FACTUAL. BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT STOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO WHAT I CALL FUNDAMENTALS, REALITY. THE OUTSTANDING REASON I THINK IS THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A SERIOUS MARKET CORRECTION IN 16 YEARS SO PEOPLE GET OUT OF THE HABIT OF THINKING ABOUT MARKET CORRECTIONS. THE BIGGEST SINGLE MISTAKE -- I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT, WHAT IS THE BIGGEST TO GO MISTAKE INVESTORS MAKE? I HAVE CONCLUDED IT IS THEY CONCLUDE THAT THE WAY THINGS ARE TODAY IS THE WAY IT WILL ALWAYS BE, AND THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. WHEREAS REVERSION TO THE MEAN IS MUCH MORE LIKELY. SO I THINK IT HAS WORKED VERY WELL BEING AN EQUITY INVESTOR, CONCENTRATING IN A FEW STOCKS HAS GONE VERY WELL. INVESTORS ARE BY NATURE OPTIMISTIC. THAT OPTIMISM DIES HARD. YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE MARKET ARE MOSTLY RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS AND PEOPLE GO FROM NEUTRALITY TO LIKING STOCKS TO LIKING THEM A LOT TO LIKING THEM A TON TO LIKING THEM TOO MUCH. THAT IS THE CONTINUATION THAT CREATES BUBBLES. WE PROBABLY ARE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THAT. > > WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIKING, HOWARD, MAY BE LIKE THESE ASSETS A LITTLE TOO MUCH, CAN YOU PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE THE LAST TIME YOU SAW THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT THAT LEFT YOU THINKING MAYBE SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT AS GREAT WHEN IT COMES TO BUYING SOME OF THESE ASSETS AT CURRENT VALUATIONS? IS THERE ANOTHER TIME THIS SORT OF REMIND YOU HAVE IN ANY CAPACITY? > > WELL, I GUESS, LISA, THE LAST TIME WAS PROBABLY AROUND 1997 WHEN THE MARKET WAS KIND OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH TECH STOCKS. YOU KNOW, THE MARKET WAS ROCKING ALONG. PEOPLE WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE LEVEL EVALUATION. PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE INTERNET. ALAN GREENSPAN FAMOUSLY CAUTIONED THERE MIGHT BE IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE. I PICKED 1997 BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH GREENSPAN WAS CONCERNED ABOUT EXUBERANCE, THE MARKET WENT ON TO RISE FOR ANOTHER 2.5-3 YEARS. REMEMBER I SAID WE ARE IN THE EARLY DAYS. TOM: HOWARD MARKS SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY TO BLOOMBERG. NOVONESIS SHARES SLUMPING TODAY. PRODUCES ENZYMES, PROTEINS, PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS REPORTED EARNINGS EARLIER. ANALYSTS SAY PROFITABILITY MS. AND REITERATED MARGIN GUIDANCE DISAPPOINTED. JOINING US NOW IS ESTER BAIGET, CEO OF NOVONESIS. THE STOCK IS DOWN 6.6%. IT SEEMS TO BE MARGINS AND THE FORECASTS ARE BOUND MARGINS IS WHERE SOME OF THIS DISAPPOINTMENT LIES. BY 2030, 30 9%. SOME OF THE MARKET IS EXPECTED 40% OR MORE. WHY COULDN'T YOU MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS? > > THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING US TODAY. WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS WITH THE FIRST HALF, 9% REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITABLE REVENUE GROWTH. ALSO MAINTAINING THE EBITDA GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR, INCLUDING THE HEADWINDS. UPGRADING THE REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE YEAR AND THEN MAINTAINING THE MARGIN FOR THE YEAR GUIDANCE, INCLUDING THE STRONG HEADWINDS WE ARE SEEING FROM CURRENCY. THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION ON THE GUIDANCE FOR THE LONG-TERM, WE ARE A GROWTH COMPANY. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE COMMITTING TO, PROFITABLE GROWTH . 6% TO 9% GROWTH WHILE EXPANDING PROFIT ABILITY FROM A VERY STRONG BASE FROM 37 TO 38 EBITDA MARGIN. WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE STRONG FOUNDATION IN PLACE AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON SUCCESS FORM OF GROWTH. WE CLOSE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, CONTINUE TO INVEST TO BE THE PARTNER OF GROWTH FORECAST AND DELIVER ON THIS BEAUTIFUL 6% TO 9% PROFITABLE GROWTH THAT WE ARE COMMITTING TO. TOM: THAT BEAUTIFUL 6% TO 9% BY 2030. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT? HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT? IS THAT A CONSERVATIVE OUTLOOK? > > QUITE STRONG OUTLOOK, 6% TO 9% AT 39% EBITDA MARGIN AT THE END. AT THE END OF THE STRATEGIC PERIOD, 39%. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BRINGING SOLUTIONS THAT TRANSFORM THE WAY WE PRODUCE IN THE GOODS WE CONSUME. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS OF A HIGH CONTENT WITH COMPROMISING PACE, TEXTURE, PROFITABILITY. WE ARE TALKING SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE CLEAN LABOR, ALLOW HIGH EFFICIENCIES, HIGHER YIELDS LESS MICRO PLASTICS, NEW BUILDING BLOCKS ON THE ENERGY WE CONSUME. THOSE ARE THE CATEGORIES WE ARE IN AND CONTINUE TO INVEST TO DELIVER ON THAT 6% TO 9% AND ALSO MARGIN EXPANSION. TOM: AT A TIME WHERE WE HAVE PU TARIFFS. WHAT IS THE TARIFF IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE? > > THAT IS AN AMAZING QUESTION BECAUSE YOU ARE IMPLYING YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE TARIFF SITUATION IN THE FUTURE. SO I'M GOING TO BASE AND FRAME MY ANSWER ON TODAY. WE DO LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD THAT YOU DO. WE FIRST SEE, FORECAST A TOTAL NET NO IMPACT STEP MOST OF WHAT WE PRODUCE WE SELL IN THE U.S. IS PRODUCED IN THE U.S. WE WILL BRING TO OPTIMIZING EXTREMELY GLOBAL RESILIENT FOOTPRINT WHILE ALSO THROUGH PRICING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR A NET-NET COME IMPACT FROM TARIFFS IN 2025, IT IS NEUTRAL AND NON. IT IS TRUE THIS COULD CAUSE IMPACT ON THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. THAT IS THE REALITY I BELIEVE. WE SEE SOME SLOW DOWN AND HEALTH CARE AND SOFTNESS IN BEVERAGES. AT THE SAME TIME, WE CONTINUE TO SEE EXTRAORDINARY POLL ON THE DEMAND, GROWING DEMAND FOR SOLUTIONS FOR CLEANER LABOR, HIGHER YIELDS, HIGHER EFFICIENCY, MUSCLE WEIGHT, ADVANCED SOLUTIONS THAT COMPLEMENT THE WAY WE EAT AND TO BRING SOLUTIONS TO THE CONSUMERS. TOM: YOU UPDATED YOUR STRATEGY TODAY. TO WHAT EXTENT WILL M & A PLAY A ROLE IN THAT STRATEGY? > > THE 6% TO 9%, IT IS ORGANIC GROWTH. SO WE ARE COMMITTING TO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER ON WHAT WE HAVE TODAY BY CONTINUING TO INVEST IN CONTINUING TO BE CLOSE TO THE CUSTOMERS. WE ARE A BIOSOLUTIONS POWERHOUSE. WE BRING BIOLOGICAL BASED SOLUTIONS TO RESPOND TO OUR CUSTOMER NEEDS OF TODAY AND THE FUTURE. AND ALWAYS WE ARE GOING TO BE EXPLORING AND OPEN TO OPTIONS IN THE MARKET THAT COULD BUILD UP AND EXPAND AND BOOST OUR PERFORMANCE AND DRIVE VALUE ADDED FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS WHILE MAKING THIS ALSO A HAVEN FROM A STRONGER PARTNER OF GROWTH FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. TOM: YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELVES AS A POWERHOUSE. SOME OF YOUR COMPETITORS HAVE GIVEN THEIR GUIDANCE -- IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK, DO YOU THINK GROWTH FOR THE INDUSTRY IS NORMALIZING? > > BEAR IN MIND, WE PLAY IN THE SAME MARKETS THAT GROW 1% TO 2% AND WE HAVE A GUIDANCE OF 6% TO 9%. WE ARE ALWAYS OUTGROWING THE MARKETS. WE DO THAT BY BEING CLOSER TO THE CUSTOMERS AND BRINGING THEM MORE PORTION OF THE ANSWERS OF THE FUTURE THAT THEY GROW FASTER. YOU CANNOT MAKE LOW SUGAR ADDED WITH CHEAPER SUGAR. YOU CANNOT MAKE LOW SALT WITH ALSO MORE -- YOU CANNOT MAKE LOW MICRO PLASTICS WITH CHEAPER PLASTICS. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GROWING FASTER IN THE MARKET. WE SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A SLOW DOWN AND HOUSEHOLD CARE, PARTICULARLY IN NORTH AMERICA. WE'RE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY. THAT IS ALSO IN THE GUIDANCE. ALSO WHAT WE SEE FOR THE STRATEGIC PERIOD OF HOW WE ARE SEEING THE NORMALIZED GROWTH OF HOUSEHOLD CARE MOVING FORWARD. TOM: ESTER BAIGET, CEO OF NOVONESIS. 6% TO 9% IN TERMS OF ORGANIC SALES GROWTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. CROSSING RIGHT NOW, TALKING ABOUT DEALMAKING, DEALMAKING IN TERMS OF DEFENDANT SPACE. MEDIA BANK INVESTORS REJECT THEY COULD GENERALLY BID IN LOGGIA CEO. REJECTING THE BIDS SING OFFER HAS LAPSED ACCORDING TO MEDIA BANKO. THE PRICING REACTION TO THAT. \u266a",
