  "title": "How Frank Rizzo, a high school dropout, became Philadelphia\u2019s toughest cop and a harbinger of MAGA politics",
  "description": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)",
  "content": "The 2,000-pound bronze tribute to the former police commissioner-turned-mayor had stood in front of the city\u2019s Municipal Services Building from 1998 until 2020, when then-mayor Jim Kenney ordered it removed days after protesters attempted to topple it during the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nAs police commissioner from 1967 to 1971 and mayor from 1972 to 1979, Rizzo became a hero to the white, blue-collar Philadelphians who clamored for \u201claw and order\u201d and railed against liberal policymaking. Until he died in 1991, while running a third campaign to retake the mayor\u2019s office, Rizzo was an avatar of what I call \u201cblue-collar conservatism.\u201d\n\nAs deputy commissioner in the 1960s, Rizzo directly confronted the city\u2019s civil rights movement. Among other exploits, he commanded the response to the Columbia Avenue Uprising in 1964, when North Philadelphia residents responded to an all-too-common act of police brutality with three days of urban disorder.\n\nFor two terms he rewarded his supporters by opposing and limiting liberal programs they had fought, like public housing, school desegregation and affirmative action. When dissatisfied Democrats challenged his reelection in 1975, Rizzo vowed revenge by saying he would \u201cmake Atilla the Hun look like a fa\u2014t.\u201d\n\nHe also offered affirmation to a beleaguered white, blue-collar identity. His supporters raved about his forceful policing and cheered his anti-liberalism as a last line of defense against policies they considered threats to their livelihoods. Just as important, they saw themselves reflected in the rough-talking high school dropout who worked his way up to the most powerful position in Philadelphia.\n\nThat kind of identity-based populism offered social and cultural victories even when it did little to address the declining economy that struck urban America in the 1970s. So while Rizzo\u2019s populism had few answers for deindustrialization, in 1972 he was able to temporarily halt construction on a public housing project in an all-white section of his native South Philadelphia.\n\nLike Rizzo, Trump\u2019s appeal is more social and cultural than economic. Critics have argued that Trump\u2019s promotion of traditional Republican economic policies belie the notion that he is a populist. Trump\u2019s populism, however, lies not in his ability to deliver working-class prosperity, but conservative victories in the nation\u2019s long-standing culture wars.",

      "text": "Donald Trump Is Frank Rizzo, Reborn\nRocco DiSipio is a small-business owner in a working-class neighborhood where times aren\u2019t quite as good as they once were. He isn\u2019t used to being interviewed by reporters, but it\u2019s primary season, and journalists want to know what the man-on-the-street thinks of the brash conservative candidate who seems to do everything wrong \u2014 and keeps winning anyway.\n\u201cThis election has some racism,\u201d admits DiSipio, acknowledging that his candidate can be blunt, or worse. His pick doesn\u2019t have the typical qualifications, either, but for DiSipio, that\u2019s part of the appeal. \u201cHe\u2019s going to stand behind his word if it kills him. He can flunk at it, but you can\u2019t say he won\u2019t try.\u201d\nTraditional elites and professional politicians are baffled that such a man could rise so high in the polls. He defies political conventional wisdom at every turn, flouting party leaders and blithely dropping quotes that would wreck any other campaign. \u201cThis is not a normal election,\u201d a Republican operator tells a Washington Post reporter. \u201cAll normal voting patterns are out the window.\u201d\nThis sounds like a dispatch from the Republican presidential primary campaign, and the candidate sounds a lot like Donald Trump.\nBut the quotes are actually from Philadelphia circa 1971, a time when a big bloc of the city fell for a different candidate who radiated authority and charisma \u2014 someone who would take charge and tell things as they were. That candidate was Frank Rizzo, whose unpolished tough-guy bravado, labor-friendly conservative populism and strident appeals for law and order spoke directly to the concerns of struggling working- and middle-class whites. Today, Donald Trump makes a very similar case to very similar voters.\nBoth men are known for their outsized personalities, unfiltered rhetoric, hatred for the media and utter assurance in their own righteousness. Both weaponized calculated bursts of invective: Rizzo promised to \u201cmake Attila the Hun look like a faggot,\u201d while Trump assures his fans that he\u2019ll \u201cbomb the shit out of ISIS.\u201d\nBoth placed themselves above other politicians as a breed apart, tougher and more genuine. \u201cI have high principles \u2014 stand for good,\u201d Rizzo told Newsweek in 1971. \u201cIf anybody gives me a bloody nose, I\u2019ll wipe it off and just love to mix it up. My strategy is to be Frank Rizzo. No glib talk. No talking with forked tongue for Frank Rizzo.\u201d Forty-five years later, Donald Trump is leading the Republican field. \u201cI\u2019m the only one that speaks my mind and tells the truth and everybody knows I\u2019m right,\u201d the magnate told a Fox News anchor last year, after his comments about temporarily banning Muslims from the United States. \u201cYou know what my campaign strategy is? Honesty. I say it like it is.\u201d\nRizzo tucked a nightstick in his cummerbund, and working-class white Philadelphians swooned. Trump pounds out 140-character insults on Twitter \u2014 his enemies are \u201cfailing,\u201d \u201cgrubby,\u201d \u201clow-energy\u201d losers/phonies/dummies \u2014 for similar effect. \u201cBoth those guys are just saying what everyone else is thinking, what the average American is thinking,\u201d says Diane Gochin, 58, who backed Rizzo when she lived in the city and supports Trump now. \u201cWith Trump, as with Rizzo, he is not bound by the bar association or the banks or anything else,\u201d says Gochin, who now lives in Montgomery County but grew up in Northeast Philadelphia and worked in the vast bureaucracy of Thomas Jefferson hospital. \u201cHe\u2019s the best bet we have for bringing the common people back into government.\u201d\nIN AN OCTOBER National Journal article, longtime political reporter John B. Judis dusted off some sociological research from the 1970s that had been published in the book The Radical Center: Middle Americans and the Politics of Alienation, by Donald Warren. Warren conducted surveys of large groups of white voters and identified within them a voting bloc he called Middle American Radicals (MARs). Their ideology, as Judis describes it, \u201crevolved around an intense conviction that the middle class was under siege from above and below.\u201d\nMARs were distrustful of big business, and they favored some economic policies well loved by liberals, like a robust minimum wage and job guarantees. But they were also bitterly opposed to welfare and affirmative action and deeply suspicious of the federal government. Another hallmark: More than any other group Warren studied, MARs thought Washington, D.C., works best \u201cwhen one person is in charge.\u201d\nVoters like these have been around for generations. They were supporters of Alabama governor George Wallace, who ran for president on a platform that promised law and order, repeal of civil rights advancements, and a robust system of social insurance. (Wallace told Newsweek in 1972 that if elected, he\u2019d consider making Rizzo the director of the FBI.) In more recent years, some have backed Ross Perot or Pat Buchanan. But they\u2019ve never amassed enough numbers to pick a major-party presidential candidate.\nIn the 1970s, big U.S. cities were packed with malcontented working-class white voters. Rizzo wasn\u2019t the only conservative populist elected mayor of a big city. But none of them caught on nationally.\nTrump obviously has. And that\u2019s partly because large numbers of white Americans are gripped now by the same anxieties that troubled Rizzo\u2019s base. In the early 1970s, most of America was still enjoying the broadly shared prosperity of the postwar Golden Age. Philly, though, wasn\u2019t. By 1972, there were only 142,300 manufacturing jobs left in town. The city had shed a staggering 93,000 well-paying factory jobs in just 18 years. Property values were stagnant, and crime was on the rise. Between 1967 and 1970, the homicide count grew by 50 percent, and the number of reported robberies more than doubled. Working-class whites resented liberal do-gooders and capital flight on one hand, and on the other a growing African-American population that was demanding its rightful share of jobs, services and political power.\nThose conditions created legions of Rizzocrats in Philly, and similar conditions help explain the Trump phenomenon today. By 2044, America will no longer be a majority white nation. That demographic shift is accelerating \u2014 and, it seems, becoming increasingly real in the minds of many white Americans. At the same time, wide swaths of the population have suffered declining living standards and stagnant wages, just as many Philadelphians did in the late 1960s. Manufacturing industries have been vaporized everywhere in America, not just the Midwest and the Northeast, plummeting from 17.3 million jobs in 2000 to 11.5 million in 2010. Both eras saw large numbers of working- and middle-class whites unsettled by rapidly changing cultural norms: the civil rights movement in Rizzo\u2019s time, gay marriage and Black Lives Matter today.\nCrime looms as one seemingly huge difference between America in 2016 and Rizzo\u2019s violence-plagued Philly. \u201cI specifically remember Rizzo because I lived in town at that time and I used to walk from the University of Pennsylvania to Society Hill, and it was safe to do so,\u201d recalls Gochin. \u201cWhen Rizzo was mayor, we had a cop on every corner, and he was very aggressive about keeping the city safe. That\u2019s what I remember about Rizzo. The city was prospering. After he was gone, there would be these wolfpacks that would come out. I moved a couple years after that because it wasn\u2019t safe anymore.\u201d\nToday, crime is at record-low rates across much of the country. Nonetheless, Trump has tapped into the same sort of racially charged security fears that Rizzo ran on. The real estate mogul has thrilled his supporters by smearing Mexican immigrants as \u201ccriminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.\u201d There\u2019s a bright, easily traced line between Trump\u2019s vows build an enormous wall on America\u2019s southern border and Rizzo\u2019s own peace through strength proclamations: \u201cThe only other thing we can do now is buy tanks and start mounting machine guns.\u201d\nAs mayor, Rizzo organized a special police squad to spy on his opponents, hired hundreds of new police officers, and once circled the Inquirer\u2019s loading dock with angry supporters, blocking delivery of the paper after it angered him. During the 1971 election, after the Democratic governor scrapped Pennsylvania\u2019s death penalty, Rizzo mused, \u201cMaybe we need a local option. Maybe we can have our own electric chair.\u201d In another interview, he said the Black Panthers \u201cshould be strung up. \u2026 I mean, within the law.\u201d\nTrump has, if anything, appeared even less concerned than Rizzo with niceties like due process. After the Paris attacks, Trump told Yahoo News: \u201cSome people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule. \u2026 And so we\u2019re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago. \u2026 \u201d\nIn times of shared economic prosperity, figures like Trump and Rizzo fall flat. But when economic growth is unequal and uncertain, anti-immigrant sentiment and racial tension quickly come to the fore. \u201cEvery time you go through a period in which the bulk of American families lose a sense of getting ahead, certain kinds of problems start to appear,\u201d says Harvard economics professor Benjamin M. Friedman, author of The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth. \u201cThis is about people worrying about their ability to get ahead and their position in the economy and the society.\u201d\nTHERE ARE, OF COURSE, innumerable personal differences between Donald Trump, who grew up rich and privileged, and Frank Rizzo, the son of a rowhouse beat cop. But the nature of their political appeal is strikingly similar, not just because of what they say, but because of how they say it. Both figures \u201coffer a populism of style,\u201d says Timothy J. Lombardo, author of the forthcoming The Rise of Blue-Collar Conservatism: Frank Rizzo\u2019s Philadelphia and the Politics of the Urban Crisis. \u201cTrump plays this over-the-top and very masculine role. Same thing Rizzo did. People are unwilling to trust politicians of any stripe, but these guys don\u2019t sound like politicians.\u201d\nEstablishment Republicans and progressives look at Trump and see a reckless, narcissistic, even dangerous figure. Gochin, though, sees in Trump what she saw in Rizzo: the confidence and certitude to fight the necessary battles \u2014 against corruption in government, political correctness, globalization \u2014 and win.\n\u201cThis is not the country I grew up in, and I\u2019m not leaving this for my kids,\u201d says Gochin. \u201cTrump keeps saying this is all bullshit we\u2019re seeing here. They\u2019ve sent all our jobs out overseas. Everything is so screwed up here, it\u2019s frightening. Before we are in total collapse, someone has to stick their neck out there. Trump, if he wins, he\u2019s got the mouth, and he\u2019s got brass balls.\u201d\nAnd Trump is now the favorite to win the Republican primary. Polls have him neck-and-neck with far-right-wing Ted Cruz in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, and Trump is way ahead in New Hampshire and South Carolina. In national polls, he\u2019s doubled up on Cruz and is even further ahead of the rest of the Republican gaggle.\nCan a populist conservative like Trump govern? Frank Rizzo\u2019s record isn\u2019t encouraging. Philadelphia lost a crippling 13.5 percent of its population during the 1970s. In Rizzo\u2019s first four years, an estimated 980 companies and 41,000 jobs left the city. Rizzo signed off on the largest tax hike in Philadelphia history, which was needed in part because of his extravagant spending on the police department, municipal union contracts and patronage appointments. He even failed to drive down crime. There were 385 murders in his last year in office, 33 more than his first year in office. (The 2015 total was 280.)\nBut those are statistics, and they don\u2019t reflect how many Rizzo voters, many no longer living in the city, remember his time in office. They remember instead that Rizzo spoke to them, and that he went to work every day intent on keeping them safe.\nPublished as \u201cFrank Rizzo, Reborn\u201d in the March 2016 issue of Philadelphia magazine."

      "text": "SUNDAY SHOWS: The Golden Age of America Is Here\nThis morning, President Donald J. Trump and his administration were on the airwaves in force as they explained how, in just seven weeks, the Golden Age of America is here.\nHere\u2019s what you missed:\nPresident Trump on Sunday Morning Futures\n- On pausing tariffs on certain imports: \u201cI wanted to help the American car makers \u2014 until April 2nd. April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal \u2014 what they charge us, we charge them.\u201d\n- On Democrats\u2019 disgusting behavior during his joint address: \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with them. I can\u2019t even believe it \u2026 They were talking about men playing in women\u2019s sports \u2026 Republicans were going wild and the Democrats were having their little signs up \u2014 their little signs, their little, tiny signs \u2026 It\u2019s unbelievable. They don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n- On resurrecting American shipbuilding: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re building a tremendous foundation for the future \u2026 You just saw one of the biggest shipbuilders in the world in the Oval Office \u2026 He\u2019s announcing a $20 billion investment in the United States.\u201d\n- On Ukrainian President Zelensky: \u201cHe took money out of this country, under Biden, like candy from a baby \u2026 I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s grateful.\u201d\n- On Russia: \u201cNobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump \u2026 The biggest job they\u2019ve ever done was the pipeline, Nord Stream 2\u2026 They were going to supply Germany and everybody else all over Europe. And what did I do? I stopped it.\u201d\n- On the Panama Canal: \u201cThe Carter administration gave the Panama Canal, for $1, gave the Panama Canal to Panama for no reason \u2026 We\u2019re taking the Panama Canal back.\u201d\n- On protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security: \u201cI\u2019m not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we\u2019re going to get fraud out of there \u2026 Everybody wants us to get the fraud out, and therefore you\u2019ll make it better.\u201d\n- On DOGE: \u201cWhat [Elon Musk] has done is unbelievable \u2026 He has found hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fake contracts.\u201d\n- On education: \u201cWe want to bring the schools back to the states because we have, literally, we have the worst education department and education in the world \u2026 We\u2019re ranked at the bottom of the list, and yet we\u2019re number one when it comes to cost per pupil.\u201d\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Face the Nation\n- On illegal border crossings reaching record lows: \u201cThis isn\u2019t Joe Biden\u2019s world anymore. This is President Donald Trump\u2019s country \u2014 where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody.\u201d\n- On deporting criminal illegal immigrants: \u201cWe have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month.\u201d\n- On Biden\u2019s failure to secure the border: \u201cPresident Biden didn\u2019t follow the law. He didn\u2019t follow the law in the fact that it\u2019s always been equally applied until his administration and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.\u201d\n- On holding Mexico and Canada accountable for fentanyl: \u201cIn the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn\u2019t follow through on \u2026 Every day in this country, people are dying of overdoses.\u201d\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on This Week\n- On the February jobs report: \u201cIn just one month alone, after losing 110,000 manufacturing jobs, we made 10,000 in February alone \u2014 9,000 of them were auto jobs.\u201d\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on Meet the Press\n- On tariffs: \u201cWe\u2019ll unleash America out to the world, grow our economy in a way we\u2019ve never grown before. You are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America.\u201d\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Fox & Friends Weekend\n- On government funding: [The continuing resolution] \u201cfreezes spending while allowing the government to continue to function, allowing ICE agents and Border Patrol to continue their mass deportation effort, allows President Trump\u2019s cabinet continue to identify waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal bureaucracy \u2014 so the president supports this CR, and we\u2019re hopeful and expect Republicans to get on board so we can pass it and continue moving forward implementing President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d"

      "text": "The White Backlash to the Civil Rights Movement\nThe United States of America was deeply affected by the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Upending centuries of white privilege and decades of official and unofficial racial segregation, this movement fundamentally reshaped the country\u2019s cultural, social, and political landscape. Change did not come without cost, unfortunately, and one of those costs was white backlash because of the erosion of the privilege they had come to view as their right. The historical scholarship of the past 22 years has shown that this backlash took many different forms, but one thread can be seen throughout: white Americans\u2019 resistance to a changing racial reality seldom was immediate, often was veiled in non-racialized language, and always had justifications that had little to do with race. In general, white backlash stemmed from resistance to an integrative racial order that attempted, at least in spirit, to dissipate white privilege and create a pluralistic and color-blind society.\nOver the past generation, scholars have investigated white backlash against the civil rights movement. To study the evolution of the scholarship on the topic of white backlash against the civil rights movement, and its effects on the conservative resurgence at the end of the 1970s, eight books will be reviewed here: Lisa McGirr\u2019s Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the American Right, Mark Brilliant\u2019s The Color of America Has Changed: How Racial Diversity Shaped Civil Rights Reform in California, 1941\u20131978, Jefferson Cowie\u2019s Stayin\u2019 Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class, Kevin Kruse\u2019s White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism, Matthew Lassiter\u2019s The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South, Ronald Formisano\u2019s Boston Against Busing: Race, Class, and Ethnicity in the 1960s and 1970s, Thomas Sugrue\u2019s The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit, and Walter Greason\u2019s Suburban Erasure: How the Suburbs Ended the Civil Rights Movement in New Jersey. Each of the eight books under review deal with the civil rights movement in specific areas of the United States, and each shows, to greater and lesser degrees, the white reaction to the movement\u2019s successes. All the eight books are relatively recent. With the exception of Formisano\u2019s and Sugrue\u2019s books, they were all written within the past twelve years, and even the former\u2019s studies appeared in the past 22 years. By considering these books in the order listed above, the reader can see the origins of the right wing movement both in California and nationally, the reactionary basis for the growth of the right wing in California and the South, and the fact that the white backlash was not localized within those regions, but was, rather, a national trend. The scholarship of white backlash, as these studies make clear, shows the disparate reasons for the backlash, among them the white working class\u2019s economic and social insecurity, their property value concerns, and worries about social mobility and feelings of middle class pride, that refute the contention that white backlash was solely a racial reaction to a new racialized world created by the civil rights movement.\nBefore launching into the review of the literature, it is important for the purpose of this essay to define two terms. \u201cWhite backlash\u201d means the legal and social fight against the victories of the civil rights movement. This backlash took varied forms, at some times electoral victories for the right wing, at other times it came in the form of legislation that attempted to push back against laws such as Proposition 14 in California, which struck down the Rumford Act\u2019s integrated housing in California until it too was overturned by the courts. \u201cWhite privilege\u201d means the elevated social status of whites. In the South, Jim Crow laws codified discrimination against blacks and segregation, but in other regions, discrimination prevailed because of the lack of laws preventing it, such as in Michigan, where only a non-discrimination law in 1955 prevented discriminatory hiring practices.\nLisa McGirr\u2019s 2001 book, Suburban Warriors, addresses the white conservative movement\u2019s deep roots in Orange County, California. She argues that, far from being the singular result of a backlash to the civil rights movement, conservatism was always alive and well in white America. The power of the conservative movement was not always apparent because the New Deal and victory in World War II had made liberalism the hegemonic political philosophy in America; however, in places like Orange County, a bastion of professionals who mainly worked in the military industry, a conservative political worldview was dominant. The conservative reawakening that was taking place in states like California was dismissed as unimportant by liberals and the political class, and not indicative of a wider trend nationally. As McGirr shows, this perception of the right wing was woefully inaccurate. She finds that the right\u2019s mobilization from the 1950s to 1960s constituted a large and strong movement that was overshadowed by the left wing\u2019s more colorful actions and victories in the same period.\nSimilarly, Mark Brilliant finds in The Color of America Has Changed that the white conservative movement reacted to minority gains by coalescing around Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1966 campaign for governor, and that this was a result of the nascent conservative movement in the state. Brilliant\u2019s 2010 book adds to the work McGirr began in 2001, by addressing the electoral, political consequences of the rise of the conservative movement in California after the victories of disparate minority groups in the state. Color of America in conjunction with Suburban Warriors adds to our understanding of the origins of white backlash in California and the nation, and helps to explain the political motivations and history of the white conservative movement.\nUndoubtedly, the minority victories in California described by Brilliant contributed to the growth of the conservative movement as the white backlash against the erosion of their privilege grew. This backlash expressed itself in the anger against the striking down Proposition 14\u2019s reintroduction of discrimination in housing, anger which helped to elect Ronald Reagan as governor in 1966. Brilliant explains that Proposition 14, which resisted racial integration in housing and communities, was an attempt by whites to reassert their privilege. It was not necessarily racially motivated: the margin of victory for Proposition 14, at almost 2 to 1, was roughly the same as the margin of victory for Johnson over Goldwater. Integration of white communities drove property values down, and, for many working and middle class whites, the right to private property was an important one. Despite the fact that Proposition 14 ultimately failed, it shows the resistance to change by whites that would later translate into electoral success for the conservative movement\u2019s party, the Republicans.\nIn Jefferson Cowie\u2019s 2010 book, Stayin\u2019 Alive, these dynamics of shifting political allegiance also come into play, as Cowie studies the hardhat working man\u2019s conversion from liberal icon in the beginning of the 1970s to conservative icon by the end of the decade. A changing world in which the working white man felt powerless drove the seemingly contradictory statements of Dewey Burton, who, in the introduction, is quoted as, chronologically, first a supporter of George Wallace, then of George McGovern, then of Ronald Reagan. This swinging of the pendulum from right to left and back again is explained by Cowie as motivated by a feeling of impotence that stemmed from Burton\u2019s and other white working class men\u2019s sense of a rapidly changing world and uncaring elites who both helped minorities at the expense of whites and maintained their power through the destruction of unions and worker\u2019s rights.\nJefferson Cowie\u2019s scholarship on the white backlash of the seventies has parallels with an earlier book, Kevin Kruse\u2019s 2005 study of Atlantan suburban culture, White Flight, particularly as both studies address the political struggle of both preserving white privilege. Where Cowie concentrates on the decade of the seventies in general, and is not concerned with specific regions, Kruse concentrates on the suburbs of Atlanta and their changing demographics in the wake of the civil rights movement. Both authors deal with white backlash and the double response that often occurred of both fighting against the civil rights gains and not wanting to appear to oppose progress. For Cowie, the seventies are the decade in which the white working class was finally overwhelmed by the massive social changes of the civil rights movement and decisively turned to a conservative political stance, while keeping its language and reasoning color blind. For Kruse, on the other hand, the Atlantan business community\u2019s need to attract investment and consumers led to a branding of the city as \u201cToo Busy to Hate,\u201d despite the fact that the city\u2019s whites were too busy moving out to the suburbs to be around people of color whom they could hate. White Flight analyzes the civil rights struggles in Atlanta and the white flight from the city. As with McGirr\u2019s findings in Orange County, Kruse\u2019s study sees the white backlash against the civil rights movement as rooted in the pre-existing conservative ideology in the suburbs of Atlanta. By the mid-1950s, those white communities which successfully resisted integration were uniform in their community\u2019s resistance. The uniformity of this response was intensified by their isolation within their all-white suburbs, which, as in Orange County, bred a strain of conservatism that would lead both regions to vote overwhelmingly for Barry Goldwater.\nWhite Flight\u2019s analysis of the Atlantan white backlash and the flight to the suburbs is expanded upon by Matthew Lassiter\u2019s Silent Majority. In White Flight, Kevin Kruse introduces the reader to the Atlantan civil rights demonstrations and their successes and resistance. By showing how the liberal victories of the 1950s and 1960s led to a white exodus from the city and into the suburbs, his work sets the stage for Lassiter\u2019s in depth study of the busing fights in Atlanta. Lassiter studies the anger and frustration felt by suburban white southerners at the forced integration that was destroying their postwar attainment of middle class status. Lassiter argues that the resistance to integration in Atlanta and Charlotte led directly to the idea of the silent majority, the idea of the majority of the country possesses particularly conservative ideals and is uncomfortable with the social changes of the civil rights movement. Lassiter, who published in 2006, one year after Kruse, acknowledges the fact that their studies overlap. In fact, in the acknowledgements of both books, Lassiter and Kruse thank each other for their respective input. Thus, the reader can assume the conclusions each reaches are related and build upon the work of the other. White Flight and Silent Majority are different books that have different aims, but have more than a few converging topics and conclusions. Aside from the obvious similarities in their subject matter, both Lassiter and Kruse point out that Atlanta\u2019s self-perception of an enlightened and modern city was belied by its actual resistance to change and the official and unofficial segregation of their black and white communities. Both books address the feelings of middle class pride and its challenge and devaluation by integration. Both books also address and contest the mythology that the Atlantan business community solved the school desegregation conflict. Rather, they argue that this success was more a result of fortunate timing than anything else, and the credit taken afterwards was simply a case of taking advantage of a fortuitous situation.\nSilent Majority tells a story of resistance to integration in the south, but resistance occurred in the north as well, for many of the same reasons. Ronald Formisano\u2019s 1991 work Boston Against Busing describes the violent and racist attacks on busing by white Bostonians in the 1970s, and shows that white backlash was more complex than simply a race-based reaction to integration. Boston\u2019s and Charlotte\u2019s experiences in the antibusing movement were similar but different. Both cities underwent the forced integration of their schools and resisted. Both cities were integrating school districts in neighborhoods which were white, but middle class. Both cities formed organizations to pool their resistance efforts. A recurring theme in all the books discussed in this paper is the class system which protected the white elite from the measures they imposed on lower class whites to achieve racial integration. In Boston and Charlotte, as well as in Atlanta, this class divide was noticeable. Many whites in all three cities felt that their work to climb the social ladder was being destroyed almost as soon as they had achieved middle class status. Thus, the anger provoked by busing and integration in these three cities can be seen as much a product of class rage as of racial hatred, again referencing Jefferson Cowie\u2019s introduction which cites the odd voting pattern of Dewey Burton. Burton truly wanted someone in office who would stand up to the elites, whom he, as well as many white members of the working class, saw as both engaging in social engineering and not having to deal with the consequences.\nBoston was hardly the only northern city with racial problems, however. Detroit was a city with de facto segregation, as Thomas Sugrue notes in his 1996 book, The Origins of the Urban Crisis. Urban Crisis shows that in Detroit, much as Kruse shows was the case in Atlanta in White Flight, the white population segregated itself from the black population by fleeing to the suburbs. The black population of Detroit grew in the early twentieth century, and the resulting integration of the city was mistrusted, to say the least, by its white autoworkers. Sugrue\u2019s research into the integration of blacks into white communities and workplaces in Detroit shows that despite the city\u2019s northern geography, and the lack of actual Jim Crow laws to enforce segregation and inequality, the city\u2019s racial problems were very similar to those of cities in the south. Detroit whites, like their southern counterparts, feared that the integration of blacks into their neighborhoods would drive down property values. In Detroit, employment discrimination based on race was widespread and common even after the passage of equal rights legislation in 1955. Housing discrimination marginalized poor blacks who needed assistance and neighborhood integration. Integration was resisted by whites with the usual language of \u201crights.\u201d By choosing to have his discussion focus on the city of Detroit, Sugrue explains the roots and causes of white backlash, in a way that also displays for the reader the consequences of class divisions. Sugrue\u2019s work is extraordinarily influential in the field of U.S. history; his name appears in two of the acknowledgements in the books discussed in this essay as a helpful source and conversationalist. Thus, Urban Crisis stands as an important piece of the scholarship in the study of white backlash, although it comes at least a decade before all but one of the books in this essay. Not only can one infer that Sugrue\u2019s research has had an effect on the other scholars, but their acknowledgements show that his work and knowledge are an important part of the work on the subject.\nIn his 2013 study of rural New Jersey blacks, Suburban Erasure, Walter Greason discusses both pre- and post civil rights movement New Jersey, lending a broader perspective to the roots and causes of later white backlash. Greason argues that the white backlash against the civil rights movement was as much about the failure of America to create a just and equitable society in the first half of the twentieth century as it was a backlash against the victories of the movement in the 1950s and 1960s. The migration northward by blacks in response to violence in the south, and their encroachment into white towns and neighborhoods in New Jersey led to a natural segregation of those areas as whites moved away. Despite the fact that society was heavily invested in New Jersey in maintaining the racial hierarchy that kept white privilege in effect, black activists in the towns where blacks settled managed to win, to varying degrees, battles for basic municipal rights. Predictably, the issue of privilege became a motivator for whites, who did not appreciate having to provide services for their fellow citizens who happened to be black. By self-segregating, whites created boundaries and distance, as well as maintaining differences in property values, between the races. Greason references ideas of racial purity as defining the segregationist cause in the early years of the United States, and argues that these attitudes and the actions of racial separation became tradition over many years (Greason says there is evidence that traditions of segregation and racial separatism began as far back as the late seventeenth century). In fact, for all the technical successes of local activists in New Jersey and the civil rights movement as a whole in this country, segregation continued, and continues, to this day.\nThe scholarship in the field of white backlash against the civil rights movement in the past twenty-two years has offered great insight on the subject. From Formisano\u2019s work on the Boston busing fights in 1991, which definitively tells the story of a stain on the enlightened reputation of the northeastern city, to Greason\u2019s 2013 work on rural New Jersey blacks and their struggles, and the white power structure\u2019s self-segregation in reaction to these varying degrees of victory, the past two decades or so has been a revealing time for the historiography. Formisano and Sugrue\u2019s works were both published in the 1990s, and their findings on the topic of white backlash rely heavily on a class based perspective. For Formisano, the Boston antibusing movement was as motivated by the upward mobility and feelings of middle class pride that the whites of South Boston had as it was on racial divisions. Similarly, in Detroit, Thomas Sugrue shows that Detroit whites\u2019 feelings of pride in having achieved middle-class status had a great deal to do with their flight to the suburbs. Both studies find that white backlash owed a great deal to feelings of anti-elitism and a desire to hold onto one\u2019s sense of class.\nLisa McGirr, Kevin Kruse and Matthew Lassiter wrote their books in the early 2000s, and the availability of sources, as well as general interest in the topic, had increased by the time they began their work. McGirr\u2019s 2001 work upends the idea that white backlash was a purely reactionary movement, and instead examines the deep roots of conservatism in white America. White backlash was simply the vehicle by which this already large movement could deliver its message to the broader public. Kruse, too, finds that blaming the backlash on reactive forces is too simple an explanation for the rise of the right. His 2005 examination of Atlanta describes how the white population of Atlanta was able to mask its racist and segregationist attitudes by removing itself from the city and moving to the suburbs, where its conservatism had a perfect environment in which to grow. Lassiter also comes to this conclusion in 2006, although he concentrates more on the idea of the silent majority- that members of the white conservative movement, seeing their world changing so quickly, believed that their perspective on the world and their rights was more universal than not and their movement gained a moral justification from this notion of the silent majority.\nFinally, the work in the later years of the decade by Brilliant, Cowie, and Greason integrates the earlier scholarship and shows the direction of study in the field today. Brilliant takes on the entirety of Californian minority politics, and in doing so, lends a newer, and clearer, look at white backlash in the state that elected Ronald Reagan. The individual reductions in white privilege in California that various minority groups achieved were in total too much of a challenge to the white hegemony of the time, leading to a full rejection of government interventions employing the language of \u201crights.\u201d Cowie explains that the evolution of the hard hat working man from liberal to conservative icon in the decade of the seventies was rooted in the white working class\u2019s feelings of helplessness as their white privilege was taken from them at the same time as their careers were wrecked by a changing economy. The seventies ended with the appropriation of the language of populism by Reagan, who disguised the truth about his conservative policies by relying on anti-elitist and reassuringly authoritarian rhetoric. And Greason explains the process by which, even in the liberal Northeast, whites maintained their privilege by segregating themselves from the black interlopers (as they were seen by whites) who moved into their towns. New Jersey is hardly alone in this, but Greason\u2019s concentration on the rural townspeople\u2019s experience of blacks, and the wider racial divisions that have existed for centuries, gives deeper understanding to the reasons for white backlash.\nThe scholarship presented in this essay on white backlash is strong, but there are certain areas in which all these studies display deficiencies. Chief among these is the absence of the female perspective in the books. White families, workers, and men are consistently cited and presented, but the experience of women in the white backlash against the civil rights movement is woefully underrepresented. Also, with the exception of Mark Brilliant\u2019s study, all the works discussed focus wholly on the black/white conflict. The experiences of people of color other than blacks in America during the time period of the civil rights movement and the white backlash are also important and can help us to gain a clearer understanding of the time period. Finally, although the political and business elites\u2019 interests and their manipulations of white anger to further their ends are mentioned quite frequently in the books, the field of study would benefit greatly from an analysis focused directly on the experiences of these elites. Though the elites were involved in the legislation and forceful process of integration, the consequences of this integration hardly, if ever, reached their communities. It would be interesting and important for the historiography if the elites\u2019 participation in and view of white backlash and the civil rights movement were documented.\nThe white backlash against the civil rights movement and against the victories of liberalism ushered in the age of conservatism that we still live in today. The scholarship of the authors whose works are discussed in this essay has added to our understanding of why conservatism became such a strong and vibrant political force in the later years of the twentieth century and the early years of the twenty-first. From antibusing movements to self-segregation, class concerns to racism, the origins of, and reasons for, white backlash are varied. The historiographical works discussed here all work together to explain how these varied reasons all coalesce into a whole. White backlash was a reaction to the civil rights movement, but the foundations of conservatism were already in place. The conservative movement used white backlash as the vehicle by which their \u201csilent majority\u201d came into political power. The class insecurity of the white middle class led to a feeling of anti-elitism that further exacerbated their backlash to what they saw as social engineering imposed by those who governed them. Despite some deficiencies noted above, the scholarship of these eight authors has helped to invigorate the study of white backlash."

      "text": "It has happened before: an upset victory by a Democratic Socialist in an important primary election after an extraordinary grassroots campaign.\nIn the summer of 1934, Upton Sinclair earned the kind of headlines that greeted Zohran Mamdani\u2019s primary victory on June 24, 2025, in the New York City mayoral election.\nMamdani\u2019s win surprised nearly everyone. Not just because he beat the heavily favored former governor Andrew Cuomo, but because he did so by a large margin. Because he did so with a unique coalition, and because his Muslim identity and membership in the Democratic Socialists of America should have, in conventional political thinking, made victory impossible.\nThis sounds familiar, at least to historians like me. Upton Sinclair, the famous author and a socialist for most of his life, ran for governor in California in 1934 and won the Democratic primary election with a radical plan that he called End Poverty in California, or EPIC.\nThe news traveled the globe and set off intense speculation about the future of California, where Sinclair was then expected to win the general election. His primary victory also generated theories about the future of the Democratic Party, where this turn toward radicalism might complicate the policies of the Democratic administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nWhat happened next may concern Mamdani supporters. Business and media elites mounted a campaign of fear that put Sinclair on the defensive. Meanwhile, conservative Democrats defected, and a third candidate split progressive votes.\nIn the November election, Sinclair lost decisively to incumbent Gov. Frank Merriam, who would have stood less chance against a conventional Democrat.\nAs a historian of American radicalism, I have written extensively about Sinclair\u2019s EPIC movement, and I direct an online project that includes detailed accounts of the campaign and copies of campaign materials.\nUpton\u2019s 1934 campaign initiated the on-again, off-again influence of radicals in the Democratic Party and illustrates some of the potential dynamics of that relationship, which, almost 100 years later, may be relevant to Mamdani in the coming months.\nCalifornia, 1934\nSinclair launched his gubernatorial campaign in late 1933, hoping to make a difference but not expecting to win. California remained mired in the Great Depression. The unemployment rate had been estimated at 29% when Roosevelt took office in March and had improved only slightly since then.\nSinclair\u2019s Socialist Party had failed badly in the 1932 presidential election as Democrat Roosevelt swept to victory. Those poor results included California, where the Democratic Party had been an afterthought for more than three decades.\nSinclair decided that it was time to see what could be accomplished by radicals working within that party.\nReregistering as a Democrat, he dashed off a 64-page pamphlet with the futuristic title I, Governor of California and How I Ended Poverty. It detailed his plan to solve California\u2019s massive unemployment crisis by having the state take over idle farms and factories and turn them into cooperatives dedicated to \u201cproduction for use\u201d instead of \u201cproduction for profit.\u201d\nSinclair soon found himself presiding over an explosively popular campaign, as thousands of volunteers across the state set up EPIC clubs \u2013 numbering more than 800 by election time \u2013 and sold the weekly EPIC News to raise campaign funds.\nMainstream Democrats waited too long to worry about Sinclair and then failed to unite behind an alternative candidate. But it would not have mattered. Sinclair celebrated a massive primary victory, gaining more votes than all of his opponents combined.\nNewspapers around the world told the story.\n\u201cWhat is the matter with California?\u201d The Boston Globe asked, according to author Greg Mitchell. \u201cThat is the farthest shift to the left ever made by voters of a major party in this country.\u201d\nBuilding fear\nPrimaries are one thing. But in 1934, the November general election turned in a different direction.\nTerrified by Sinclair\u2019s plan, business leaders mobilized to defeat EPIC, forming the kind of cross-party coalition that is rare in America except when radicals pose an electoral threat. Sinclair described the effort in a book he wrote shortly after the November election: \u201cI, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked.\u201d\nNearly every major newspaper in the state, including the five Democratic-leaning Hearst papers, joined the effort to stop Sinclair. Meanwhile, a high-priced advertising agency set up bipartisan groups with names like California League Against Sinclairism and Democrats for Merriam, trumpeting the names of prominent Democrats who refused to support Sinclair.\nFew people of any party were enthusiastic about Merriam, who had recently angered many Californians by sending the National Guard to break a Longshore strike in San Francisco, only to trigger a general strike that shut down the city.\nThe campaign against Sinclair attacked him with billboards, radio and newsreel programming, and relentless newspaper stories about his radical past and supposedly dangerous plans for California.\nEPIC faced another challenge, candidate Raymond Haight, running on the Progressive Party label. Haight threatened to divide left-leaning voters.\nSinclair tried to defend himself, energetically denouncing what he called the \u201cLie Factory\u201d and offering revised, more moderate versions of some elements of the EPIC plan. But the Red Scare campaign worked. Merriam easily outdistanced Sinclair, winning by a plurality in the three-way race.\nNew York, 2025\nWill a Democratic Socialist running for mayor in New York face anything similar in the months ahead?\nA movement to stop Mamdani is coming together, and some of what they are saying resonates with the 1934 campaign to stop Sinclair.\nThe Guardian newspaper has quoted \u201cloquacious billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman, who said he and others in the finance industry are ready to commit \u2018hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 into an opposing campaign.\u201d\nIn 1934, newspapers publicized threats by major companies, most famously Hollywood studios, to leave California in the event of a Sinclair victory. The Wall Street Journal, Fortune magazine and other media outlets have recently warned of similar threats.\nAnd there may be something similar about the political dynamics.\nSinclair\u2019s opponents could offer only a weak alternative candidate. Merriam had few friends and many critics.\nIn 2025, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who abandoned the primary when he was running as a Democrat and is now running as an independent, is arguably weaker still, having been rescued by President Donald Trump from a corruption indictment that might have sent him to prison. If he is the best hope to stop Mamdani, the campaign strategy will likely parallel 1934. All attack ads \u2013 little effort to promote Adams.\nBut there is an important difference in the way the New York contest is setting up. Andrew Cuomo remains on the ballot as an independent, and his name could draw votes that might otherwise go to Adams.\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, will also be on the ballot. Whereas in 1934 two candidates divided progressive votes, in 2025 three candidates are going to divide the stop-Mamdani votes.\nReligion also looms large in the campaign ahead. The New York City metro area\u2019s U.S. Muslim population is said to be at least 600,000, compared to an estimated 1.6 million Jewish residents. Adams has announced that the threat of antisemitism will be the major theme of his campaign.\nThe stop-Sinclair campaign also relied on religion, focusing on his professed atheism and pulling quotations from books he had written denouncing organized religion. However, a statistical analysis of voting demographics suggests that this effort proved unimportant."

      "text": "What the Rizzo statue agreement really says\nThe statue can be placed on public land, but with stipulations\nSo what does the agreement between the City of Philadelphia, and the Frank L. Rizzo Monument Committee, actually say?\nIt does not say, as the Philadelphia Inquirer inaccurately reported, that the statue may be displayed only on private property \u201cinside of a building or behind a fence, wall or other structure that makes the statue not visible from the public right of way.\u201d\nYes, the agreement says that, but it is only half of settlement agreement point 4 ( c). That language is followed by this: \u201cor (2) in a location that is 20 feet or more from any public right-of -way.\u201d\nEarlier language in the paragraph says \u201cthe statue may be displayed either (1) \u201cinside a building. . . .\u201d or (2) \u201c20 feet or more from any public right-of-way.\u201d It is an either/or proposition.\nA later court order \u201cabsolutely\u201c does not overturn the injunction, it \u201cmerely trims certain counts,\u201d says Bochetto.\nThe statue can be on public property.\nThere is an important stipulation. Point 4 (a) says the statue can be placed only on private property \u201cunless a specific location is approved in writing by the mayor or managing director.\u201d\nSo either Mayor Cherelle Parker or Managing Director Adam Thiel can approve a public location.\n\u201cThe chapter is not closed on that,\u201d said George \u201cStatuesque\u201d Bochetto, the attorney who represents the committee, and also the Rizzo statue, which was unlawfully removed by woke Mayor Jim Kenney, flexing authoritarian chops.\nA later court order \u201dabsolutely\u201d did not overturn the injunction, said Bochetto. It \u201cmerely trims\u201d certain counts, and he will soon amend FOPS law suit challenging the city\u2019s new, and insane, no-stopping in bike lane law.\nBochetto is the crusading Center City lawyer who also beat two other awful Kenney legacies \u2014 overturning Kenney\u2019s order to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, and reversing Kenney\u2019s order to box the statue of Christopher Columbus that stands in South Philly\u2019s Marconi Plaza.\nIn each case, Kenney acted outside of his authority and was spanked in separate court orders.\nIn press reports, the Rizzo statue is often called a \"source of tension.\u201d Really? When did that start? It was erected in 1998, with virtually no controversy. It was unlawfully removed in June 2020.\nThere was no talking to the mule-headed Kenney, but Bochetto says the Parker administration is easier to work with.\nMy sources tell me Parker remains open to the statue possibly being placed on public property, such as a park, but the big question is where? And, honestly, she may punt to allow Thiel\u2019s signature to be on any deal, because \u201cbacking\u201d the Rizzo statue could hurt her politically with the Left.\nIt\u2019s almost certain she will run for re-election, but what\u2019s to worry? That she\u2019ll be successfully challenged in the primary? It\u2019s never happened. The general election? Philly\u2019s astonishing Democratic 7-1 registration edge makes her re-election a lock. Incumbent Mayor Wilson Goode was easily re-elected after bombing a Philadelphia neighborhood. He even got a majority of the votes in the bombed precinct.\nSo where will it go?\nThat is a subject the Rizzo Monument Committee will discuss next week.\n[Full disclosure: I am a member of the committee.]\nAmong the issues the committee faces is finding a location where the statue will be safe from the social justice vigilantes who defaced public property and tried to pull down the statue when it was located outside the Municipal Services Building.\nCuriously, after Frank Rizzo\u2019s death in 1991, Kenney talked about renaming MSB to honor Rizzo. Obviously, that was before he attended progressive reeducation camp.\nThe renaming MSB idea went away when it was learned that a number of prominent Philadelphians, including Mayor Ed Rendell, and District Attorney Lynne Abraham, began fundraising for a statue, which became the 10-foot bronze sculpted by artist Zenos Frudakis.\nHis beautiful artwork depicted the late mayor in a friendly wave to passersby, which Inquirer numbnut columnist Will Bunch, wearing his woke blinders, described as a fascist salute. As if the artist would do that. As if the committee would accept that.\nAnd there the statue stood until being victimized by vandals \u2014 and a chicken-hearted mayor."

      "text": "The Frank Rizzo statue, once a symbol of racial strife in Philadelphia, will be returned to the committee that owns it\nThe Philadelphia Art Commission reached a settlement with the Frank L. Rizzo Monument Committee on Wednesday.\nPhiladelphia, it seems, has not yet seen the last of controversial former mayor and police commissioner Frank Rizzo.\nRizzo\u2019s statue, formerly a fixture at the Municipal Services Building across from City Hall, has long been in storage since it was removed from public view amid civil rights protests in 2020. Now, in the conclusion to a yearslong legal battle, the city has finalized an agreement transferring ownership of the statue back to the Frank L. Rizzo Monument Committee, which commissioned and donated the monument.\nAs part of the agreement, which the Philadelphia Art Commission unanimously approved Wednesday, the city will also make an $80,000 payment to the group for damages caused to the statue during its removal. The statue may only be displayed on private property, and must be behind a structure that makes it \u201cnot visible from the public right of way,\u201d the agreement states.\nExceptions, however, can be made with approval by the mayor or managing director. George Bochetto, one of the monument committee\u2019s attorneys, said the \u201cchapter is not closed\u201d on the statue\u2019s future home, and that the group is in talks with Mayor Cherelle L. Parker\u2019s administration.\nWednesday\u2019s development is the latest in the statue\u2019s 30-plus-year history, which began shortly after Rizzo died in 1991 in the midst of his fifth mayoral campaign. Here is how The Inquirer and Daily News covered it:\nRizzo comes to life\nThe path to the Rizzo statue began in 1992, about seven months after the former mayor\u2019s death. It would be a privately funded monument, with the Frank L. Rizzo Monument Committee raising money for its construction.\nA number of sites for the monument were floated, but the Municipal Services Building location, where it ended up, was not chosen without drama. Rizzo\u2019s statue was installed about 100 feet from \u201cGovernment of the People,\u201d the hulking abstract sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz for which, as mayor, he refused to provide city funds.\nAt one point, Rizzo said Lipchitz\u2019s work looked like \u201ca plasterer dropped a load of plaster,\u201d though he reportedly came to appreciate it later in life.\nZenos Frudakis, the statue\u2019s sculptor, signed a $100,000 contract with the commission in early 1994, The Inquirer reported. Initially set to be a life-size statue, its stature grew significantly before debuting publicly, landing at about 10 feet tall.\nIt started with an 18-inch model, with Rizzo\u2019s likeness based on a photograph of the former mayor at the 1972 St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, The Inquirer reported in 1998.\nThe sculptor never met Rizzo and agonized over the monument\u2019s creation. According to reports from the time, Frudakis was concerned that Rizzo\u2019s outstretched arm could have been misconstrued as a Nazi salute or a Mussolini wave, so he added a bend at the elbow. And, concerned the statue would be dwarfed by \u201cGovernment of the People,\u201d Frudakis increased the statue\u2019s size.\nThe unveiling\nRizzo\u2019s statue was installed at the Municipal Services Building days before the clock on 1998 ran out. On New Year\u2019s Day 1999, a blue plastic tarp was pulled off the monument, revealing it to the world.\nA crowd of about 150 people gathered for an unveiling ceremony that culminated with the Broomall String Band playing in the background at the Mummers Parade, The Inquirer reported. And there Rizzo stood, a 10-foot-tall, 2,000-pound version of one of the city\u2019s most divisive figures, cast in bronze for eternity.\nIt was, then-Mayor Ed Rendell said, not the only tribute to Rizzo in the city. A painting of Rizzo hung in the Mayor\u2019s Reception Room in City Hall, but that piece was unable to \u201ccatch the spirit and leadership and dominance of Mayor Rizzo.\n\u201cThis wonderful piece of art does that and more,\u201d he concluded.\nControversy, vandalism, and an eventual move\nWhile never completely without controversy, Rizzo\u2019s monument began generating significant public discourse in 2013 after George Zimmerman was found not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin. Following the verdict, local protests focused in part on the statue, with Inquirer coverage noting in an understatement that the former mayor and police commissioner had \u201ca poor relationship with Philadelphia\u2019s African American community.\u201d\nPublic outcry over the statue continued to grow in 2016, when protesters draped a Ku Klux Klan hood over its head following that year\u2019s Democratic National Convention. Protesters called it a monument to a reminder of racial strife and discrimination, and demanded it be taken down; the Philly Coalition for REAL Justice started a petition to have the statue removed.\n\u201cIt should never have been built,\u201d said local activist Asa Khalif, who put the hood on Rizzo\u2019s monument. \u201cAnd it should have never been placed here for us to be reminded of his brutality.\u201d\nThen-Mayor Jim Kenney, meanwhile, said he would consider moving the statue, but noted that dialogue wouldn\u2019t \u201cbe started and finished over a few days and a few hundred signatures\u201d on a petition. The following year, fervor over the monument increased, with several City Council members calling for its removal as cities around the country began rethinking their own monuments to figures with histories tied to racism.\nKenney\u2019s administration agreed that it was \u201ca good time to have that conversation about the statue\u2019s future,\u201d but did little to substantively quell public outrage.\nIn August 2017, the statue was defaced with a spray-painted message reading \u201cBlack Power Matters.\u201d Activist Wali Rahman was charged in the crime, but the charges were later dropped.\nKenney began soliciting public suggestions on what to do with the statue, and in November 2017, his office announced that it would be moved as part of a planned renovation of Thomas Paine Plaza \u2014 eventually.\nRizzo, removed\nBy 2019, Kenney said he expected the statue to remain in place until at least June 2021 as planning for the Paine Plaza revamp continued. By December 2019, the statue was again vandalized, this time with graffiti reading \u201cfascist\u201d on its suit jacket. And then, in May 2020, with the pandemic in full swing and tensions at full tilt over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the public\u2019s fury erupted in Philadelphia.\nProtesters in Philadelphia focused on the statue, attempting to burn and topple it in late May. One man attempted to destroy its head with a hammer, and others tried to yank it down with ropes. In the aftermath, the Rizzo monument\u2019s outstretched hand and face were left covered in red paint, and its body was emblazoned with graffiti.\nOnly days later, it was gone \u2014 removed in predawn hours after the height of the protests, quietly socked away into storage after years of delays. The destruction and unrest Philadelphia had experienced, it seemed, had cut through the red tape the Kenney administration had long cited for the statue\u2019s endurance. Kenney, The Inquirer reported, moved up the timeline on its removal, citing \u201cunprecedented emergency circumstances.\u201d\nIt was never to return to city property.\nThe saga continues\nAbout a month after the statue\u2019s removal, the monument committee filed a lawsuit against Kenney and the city, demanding that they be allowed to take possession of it. The city, the committee claimed, violated a 1998 agreement when it removed the statue, allegedly ignoring a stipulation that required the committee to be offered ownership in the event the monument was to be taken down.\nFour years later, the situation seemed to be on the road to resolution. The statue, The Inquirer reported, could soon be returned to the committee. Attorney George Bochetto said that the city agreed to return the statue and pay for the damages it incurred during its removal. It would, Bochetto said, be displayed once again, though the final site wasn\u2019t yet determined.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to create bad feelings or stick it to anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to display perhaps one of the more historic figures in Philadelphia history.\u201d"

      "text": "The postwar United States has experienced many forms of populist politics, none more consequential than that of the blue-collar white ethnics who brought figures like Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump to the White House. Blue-Collar Conservatism traces the rise of this little-understood, easily caricatured variant of populism by presenting a nuanced portrait of the supporters of Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo.\nIn 1971, Frank Rizzo became the first former police commissioner elected mayor of a major American city. Despite serving as a Democrat, Rizzo cultivated his base of support by calling for \"law and order\" and opposing programs like public housing, school busing, affirmative action, and other policies his supporters deemed unearned advantages for nonwhites. Out of this engagement with the interwoven politics of law enforcement, school desegregation, equal employment, and urban housing, Timothy J. Lombardo argues, blue-collar populism arose.\nBased on extensive archival research, and with an emphasis on interrelated changes to urban space and blue-collar culture, Blue-Collar Conservatism challenges the familiar backlash narrative, instead contextualizing blue-collar politics within postwar urban and economic crises. Historian and Philadelphia-native Lombardo demonstrates how blue-collar whites did not immediately abandon welfare liberalism but instead selectively rejected liberal policies based on culturally defined ideas of privilege, disadvantage, identity, and entitlement. While grounding his analysis in the postwar era's familiar racial fissures, Lombardo also emphasizes class identity as an indispensable driver of blue-collar political engagement. Blue-Collar Conservatism ultimately shows how this combination of factors created one of the least understood but most significant political developments in recent American history."

      "text": "With his Aug. 11, 2025, announcement that he was sending the National Guard \u2013 along with federal law enforcement \u2013 into Washington, D.C. to fight crime, President Donald Trump edged U.S. troops closer to the kind of military-civilian confrontations that can cross ethical and legal lines.\nIndeed, since Trump returned to office, many of his actions have alarmed international human rights observers. His administration has deported immigrants without due process, held detainees in inhumane conditions, threatened the forcible removal of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and deployed both the National Guard and federal military troops to Los Angeles to quell largely peaceful protests.\nWhen a sitting commander in chief authorizes acts like these, which many assert are clear violations of the law, men and women in uniform face an ethical dilemma: How should they respond to an order they believe is illegal?\nThe question may already be affecting troop morale. \u201cThe moral injuries of this operation, I think, will be enduring,\u201d a National Guard member who had been deployed to quell public unrest over immigration arrests in Los Angeles told The New York Times. \u201cThis is not what the military of our country was designed to do, at all.\u201d\nTroops who are ordered to do something illegal are put in a bind \u2013 so much so that some argue that troops themselves are harmed when given such orders. They are not trained in legal nuances, and they are conditioned to obey. Yet if they obey \u201cmanifestly unlawful\u201d orders, they can be prosecuted. Some analysts fear that U.S. troops are ill-equipped to recognize this threshold.\nWe are scholars of international relations and international law. We conducted survey research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Human Security Lab and discovered that many service members do understand the distinction between legal and illegal orders, the duty to disobey certain orders, and when they should do so.\nCompelled to disobey\nU.S. service members take an oath to uphold the Constitution. In addition, under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the U.S. Manual for Courts-Martial, service members must obey lawful orders and disobey unlawful orders. Unlawful orders are those that clearly violate the U.S. Constitution, international human rights standards or the Geneva Conventions.\nService members who follow an illegal order can be held liable and court-martialed or subject to prosecution by international tribunals. Following orders from a superior is no defense.\nOur poll, fielded between June 13 and June 30, 2025, shows that service members understand these rules. Of the 818 active-duty troops we surveyed, just 9% stated that they would \u201cobey any order.\u201d Only 9% \u201cdidn\u2019t know,\u201d and only 2% had \u201cno comment.\u201d\nWhen asked to describe unlawful orders in their own words, about 25% of respondents wrote about their duty to disobey orders that were \u201cobviously wrong,\u201d \u201cobviously criminal\u201d or \u201cobviously unconstitutional.\u201d\nAnother 8% spoke of immoral orders. One respondent wrote that \u201corders that clearly break international law, such as targeting non-combatants, are not just illegal \u2014 they\u2019re immoral. As military personnel, we have a duty to uphold the law and refuse commands that betray that duty.\u201d\nJust over 40% of respondents listed specific examples of orders they would feel compelled to disobey.\nThe most common unprompted response, cited by 26% of those surveyed, was \u201charming civilians,\u201d while another 15% of respondents gave a variety of other examples of violations of duty and law, such as \u201ctorturing prisoners\u201d and \u201charming U.S. troops.\u201d\nOne wrote that \u201can order would be obviously unlawful if it involved harming civilians, using torture, targeting people based on identity, or punishing others without legal process.\u201d\nSoldiers, not lawyers\nBut the open-ended answers pointed to another struggle troops face: Some no longer trust U.S. law as useful guidance.\nWriting in their own words about how they would know an illegal order when they saw it, more troops emphasized international law as a standard of illegality than emphasized U.S. law.\nOthers implied that acts that are illegal under international law might become legal in the U.S.\n\u201cTrump will issue illegal orders,\u201d wrote one respondent. \u201cThe new laws will allow it,\u201d wrote another. A third wrote, \u201cWe are not required to obey such laws.\u201d\nSeveral emphasized the U.S. political situation directly in their remarks, stating they\u2019d disobey \u201coppression or harming U.S. civilians that clearly goes against the Constitution\u201d or an order for \u201cuse of the military to carry out deportations.\u201d\nStill, the percentage of respondents who said they would disobey specific orders \u2013 such as torture \u2013 is lower than the percentage of respondents who recognized the responsibility to disobey in general.\nThis is not surprising: Troops are trained to obey and face numerous social, psychological and institutional pressures to do so. By contrast, most troops receive relatively little training in the laws of war or human rights law.\nPolitical scientists have found, however, that having information on international law affects attitudes about the use of force among the general public. It can also affect decision-making by military personnel.\nThis finding was also borne out in our survey.\nWhen we explicitly reminded troops that shooting civilians was a violation of international law, their willingness to disobey increased 8 percentage points.\nDrawing the line\nAs my research with another scholar showed in 2020, even thinking about law and morality can make a difference in opposition to certain war crimes.\nThe preliminary results from our survey led to a similar conclusion. Troops who answered questions on \u201cmanifestly unlawful orders\u201d before they were asked questions on specific scenarios were much more likely to say they would refuse those specific illegal orders.\nWhen asked if they would follow an order to drop a nuclear bomb on a civilian city, for example, 69% of troops who received that question first said they would obey the order.\nBut when the respondents were asked to think about and comment on the duty to disobey unlawful orders before being asked if they would follow the order to bomb, the percentage who would obey the order dropped 13 points to 56%.\nWhile many troops said they might obey questionable orders, the large number who would not is remarkable.\nMilitary culture makes disobedience difficult: Soldiers can be court-martialed for obeying an unlawful order, or for disobeying a lawful one.\nYet between one-third to half of the U.S. troops we surveyed would be willing to disobey if ordered to shoot or starve civilians, torture prisoners or drop a nuclear bomb on a city.\nThe service members described the methods they would use. Some would confront their superiors directly. Others imagined indirect methods: asking questions, creating diversions, going AWOL, \u201cbecoming violently ill.\u201d\nCriminologist Eva Whitehead researched actual cases of troop disobedience of illegal orders and found that when some troops disobey \u2013 even indirectly \u2013 others can more easily find the courage to do the same.\nWhitehead\u2019s research showed that those who refuse to follow illegal or immoral orders are most effective when they stand up for their actions openly.\nThe initial results of our survey \u2013 coupled with a recent spike in calls to the GI Rights Hotline \u2013 suggest American men and women in uniform don\u2019t want to obey unlawful orders.\nSome are standing up loudly. Many are thinking ahead to what they might do if confronted with unlawful orders. And those we surveyed are looking for guidance from the Constitution and international law to determine where they may have to draw that line.\nZahra Marashi, an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, contributed to the research for this article."

      "text": "Everything changes, nothing is constant, not even death, for the soul is eternal, or taxes, thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill.\nLast week, I wrote about the restoration of the Columbus Day holiday to the Philadelphia Municipal Calendar, canceled during the dark totalitarian moments of the Black Lives Matter era.\nAnd now, this week, we are told that Frank Rizzo, the extremely beloved, equally despised, and overall iconic mayor of Philadelphia, will make his statuary return to our fair city.\nThat statue, well known to three decades of city dwellers as it greeted us from the Municipal Services Building, was kidnapped by a subsequent mayor who doesn\u2019t deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the Big Bambino, and hidden away under cover of darkness as BLM cut its vengeful, ahistorical swath across the architectural landscape.\nThe times, they are indeed changing.\nFrank will not be returned to his former place of prominence, because of an agreement between the owners of the statue and the city. That agreement seems to require private placement of the artwork, somewhere not easily visible or accessible to the public.\nBut that, also, may be \u201ca changin\u2019,\u201d depending on future developments.\nThe main point is this: What was torn down, painted over, hidden away, and erased five years ago at the height of the cultural witch hunt is coming back. Those who were slandered, lied about, shunned, and maligned by people with questionable pedigrees are finding their way back to normalcy.\nAnd Frank is coming back.\nI know that this is annoying to a lot of the people who marched in the streets calling our former mayor a racist. That word, like \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201cfamine,\u201d has been misused over and over again, up to the present moment, by people who want to redesign this society according to their rigid standards of virtue and equity.\nFortunately, while their voices were loud and very influential for a time, other voices have been raised to counter their anti-intellectual heresies, including the idea that you must judge a flawed human being by the puritan standards of the 21st century and refuse to place them in the context of their own times.\nWe are, at least most of us, done with that sort of societal Etch A Sketch where people who no longer fit the prototype of the \u201cfully pronouned ethically excellent non-judgmental but Trump-hating\u201d individual now raised up as the standard of good humanity is erased from view.\nNow, it seems, we are allowed to honor people who might have had vices that marred their profiles by instead focusing on their accomplishments while also mentioning their imperfections.\nThe witch hunt, perhaps, is finally coming to an end.\nOf course, there are many people who do not see it this way at all. Simply for writing these words, I will be called a Nazi, a bigot, a rape apologist, a transphobe, and all sorts of other things that fill my inbox and social media every time I open my mouth.\nThat is perfectly fine, because at 63, one of the things that are \u201ca changin\u2019 \u201d with me besides the color of my hair and the smooth texture of my skin is my desire to give a blank about what people think about me. I no longer do.\nNeither did Frank Rizzo. And that is why he was beloved by far more people than the sum of his enemies.\nThere was a genuine love of this city that permeated the man, and set him apart from many other politicians who engaged in their craft to enrich themselves, or to change the city.\nRizzo did not want to change the city.\nHe wanted to preserve what was good about it, wanted to keep the streets clean and safe, wanted to let the folks who worked and paid taxes and rode public transportation breathe more easily, and in that way, he was the antithesis of the Dylan song.\nBut the times were spinning around him as he lived, and most certainly after his death.\nThose times changed with the winds, first turning him into a larger-than-life icon, then transforming him into a caricature of some Marvel villain, and finally showing him to be what he always was: a great Philadelphian.\nThe statue is coming back. I believe that a bit of sanity is trailing right behind.\nChristine Flowers\u2019 column is distributed by Cagle Cartoons Syndicate."

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nAs Donald Trump begins his second term as president and the leader of a remade Republican Party, it's become common to refer to him and the \"America First\" movement as \"populist.\" And yet something about the spectacle of Trump's election victory and the new Republican administration remains irreducible to the established notion of populism. To understand Trump's return, we must rethink this classification.\nIt is worthwhile to first define what is meant by \"populism.\" \"Populist reason,\" as political philosopher Ernesto Laclau called it, warps political discourse. Not only does it draw excessively oversimplified distinctions in the body politic, but it additionally offers false solutions: a plurality of social demands directed towards a singular cause. Populism ignores very real and differentiated social problems and cuts across them with a fictive target, a target that simultaneously satisfies all, and none, of these problems. In post-WWI Germany, for example, the general destabilization of economic and political structures found such an \"empty signifier\"\u2014as Laclau calls it\u2014in the Jews.\nIt is true that Trump has in the past deployed similar methods, including a sweeping condemnation of immigrants as the supposed cause of unrest in the U.S. body politic. Something has nevertheless shifted between the Trump of 2016 and the Trump of 2024-25. \"America First\" no longer implies U.S. nationalism and an exclusionist policy towards global markets and geopolitics. Today it has an imperial tone: America First implies American domination, a certain subjugation of the rest of the world to Trump and his tech-billionaire team. Trump's politics function today not by providing populist solutions to social demands, but by reconstructing these demands according to pre-existing solutions.\nThe perplexing question of Greenland illustrates the inversion of populism that Trump represents. With his threat to take over Greenland from Denmark by \"military force,\" Trump appears to be slowly replacing his former exclusionism with a revived imperialism. Yet this imperialism directly contradicts the demands of the body politic he initially captured in 2016. The appeal to domestic policy\u2014to placing American jobs first and to ending the long-standing foreign interference which characterized the prior decades\u2014was in 2016 intended as Trump's solution to a set of existing social demands by the American voter body: demands to have their own well-being protected and to shift government responsibility towards domestic rather than foreign interests.\nToday, Trump has reconstructed the very demands that he claims to be satisfying. There is nothing exclusionist about annexing Greenland\u2014in 2025, Trump contradicts his 2016 populist logic, and yet appears all the more popular in consequence. He is supported not for his exclusionist policies, but by his chauvinistic imperialism (Greenland and the Panama Canal being the principal symptoms). His voter base has become concerned with topics that would not have featured for the 2016 Trump voter\u2014all because Trump's privately oriented solutions have the effect of creating their own public demand.\nAs the Greenland spectacle was making headlines, Elon Musk only strengthened this paradox. Dismissing any concerns for Greenland's national identity, Musk stated in a post on X that Greenlanders are \"most welcome\" to become American. This \"becoming American\" is an invitation for Greenland citizens, not to migrate to America, but to universally welcome a U.S. takeover of their home. This freedom to become American is nothing but the freedom of forced choice. Not only can Greenland be annexed, Musk asserts, but the public should want it, and welcome U.S. hostility.\nThis creation of demands for which Trump subsequently offers a \"solution\" is a defining element of the new Republican Party. Greenland, Canada (which Trump stated does not, unlike Greenland, require a military takeover, but only a takeover by \"economic force\"), the teaching of LGBT rights in school, tariffs, Milei-like free capitalist markets\u2014all of these obsessive reference points for the Republican administration have set new coordinates for the demands and worries of the U.S. citizen. \"Should the U.S. strengthen its trading position with tariff threats?\" \"Will my child be turned homosexual if they are not homeschooled?\" \"Are NATO or Denmark hindering U.S. economic growth?\" These are categories imposed from the top down, not the empty \"solutions\" of populism. In a denigrating reversal of populism, Trump seems to be instructing the American populace of what they themselves should want.\nTrump's climate change denial is another constituent of this logic. It is widely agreed that the climate crisis will lead to economic catastrophe for populations around the world, including in the U.S. Yet the climate question is at odds with private financial interests and international fossil fuel corporations which drive Trump's politics. The great task of the new Republicans is therefore to situate public demands into a set of coordinates into which ecology does not figure, or for which it cannot be an apparent source of solutions. Trump described the Paris Agreement as a \"bad deal\" (when is facing up to artificial climate destruction ever meant to constitute a good deal?), and received extensive support for leaving the Paris Agreement on his first day in office. Once again, Trump did not appeal to ecological concerns by a false (populist) solution, but rather ensured that these concerns themselves would be exchanged for something beneficial to his own interests.\nThose who still try to account for Trump's return by an appeal to the category of populism are therefore missing a crucial point. The new administration deploys a logic which we cannot merely label as populist: one which does not furnish false solutions from an irreconcilable plurality of demands, but rather reconstructs demands in accordance with self-serving solutions that have no real social origins. Solutions, in other words, with no original demand\u2014this is what the new Republicans offer. In 2016, Trump could indeed have been categorized as a populist, but this is no longer the case. Understanding Trump's politics means understanding that they are qualitatively different from, and irreducible to, the widely used notion of populism.\nRafael Holmberg is a political writer and researcher on philosophy and psychoanalytic theory.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own."

      "text": "By Timothy J. Lombardo\nA familiar refrain accompanied the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 unlikely trek toward Super Bowl LII. It was perhaps best explained by Ed Rendell. Predicting an Eagles victory, Rendell said, \u201cThis team reminds me of the 1993 Phillies, just a bunch of working stiffs, not glamourous whatsoever. So blue-collar.\u201d Rendell was uniquely qualified to comment on the Phillies and Eagles. A Philadelphia sports super fan and former politician who co-hosted an Eagles postgame show while serving as governor of Pennsylvania, Rendell was also the mayor of Philadelphia when the Phillies made their World Series appearance in 1993. Although the team suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Toronto Blue Jays when Joe Carter hammered a walk-off home run in game six, the Phillies still secured their place in local sports lore. After finishing dead last in the National League East the previous season, they left few fans with high expectations as the 1993 season began. Yet they won the National League Championship with a roster that included only a few big name stars and an even greater number of slovenly-looking players with an allegedly heavy drinking regimen. Local sports writers affectionately dubbed the team the \u201cBroad Street Bellies.\u201d Ed Rendell invoked a deep strain of local sports culture and civic identity when he compared the 2017 Eagles to the Broad Street Bellies. More than that, Rendell asserted that the Eagles\u2019 blue-collar identity was also key to their first Super Bowl victory.\nRendell was hardly alone in that assertion. Writing for the Weekly Standard, Jonathan V. Last offered \u201cFive Reasons the Philadelphia Eagles are America\u2019s Team Now.\u201d Number one: Compared to their Super Bowl opponent New England Patriots, \u201cthe Eagles are blue-collar workmen.\u201d Even a Boston-area blogger framed the game as \u201cThe NFL\u2019s Super Villain vs. the Blue-Collar Underdog.\u201d After the Eagles upset the Patriots 41 \u2013 33, even the New York Times claimed that \u201cNo team idealized Philadelphia\u2019s view of itself as the Eagles did\u2014the gritty, blue-collar, Rocky-esque, good but not quite good enough.\u201d The article also questioned whether Philadelphia could maintain its self-image after winning the Super Bowl. But by conflating recent losing records with a long-ingrained sense of civic identity, the Times misjudged the depths of that identity. They also deprived it of its complex political and cultural meaning. Blue-collar identity was never solely the result of losing. In fact, it first grew out of a series of victories. Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar civic identity was the result of complementary shifts in the city\u2019s political and sports culture at a pivotal point in the city\u2019s history.\nLike a handful of other urban civic identities, Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar identity is often touted as a defining characteristic of the city and its culture. It invokes a hardscrabble, working-class ethic that promotes toughness, sacrifice, hard work, and tradition. When extended to the city\u2019s professional sports culture, the blue-collar label signifies a shared commitment to these values and reimagines sports franchises as the ambassadors of the city\u2019s civic identity. As evidenced by the commentary before and after the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl victory, the narrative of the blue-collar city has become ubiquitous to the point of clich\u00e9. While it is most often invoked in the context of Philadelphia sports, its roots lay just as much in the city\u2019s social and political history. Examining how Philadelphia became a \u201cblue-collar city\u201d reveals the term\u2019s cultural and political meaning beyond the perfunctory references that accompany sporting events, but also how professional sports helped establish, maintain, and redefine that civic identity.\nBlue-Collar Politics and Cultural Identity\nPhiladelphia\u2019s blue-collar identity emerged out of a transitional point in the city\u2019s history, in an era steeped in the mid-twentieth century city\u2019s watershed conflicts over race, class, and politics. It fully took hold as the city emerged out of the tumult of the 1960s. To be sure, the city had a much longer history of industrial work, strong labor unions, and the kind of tight-knit urban neighborhoods that fostered a specifically working-class culture, but the idea that blue-collar culture represented the city was a product of the 1970s. Prior to that, the city\u2019s civic identity was defined by its patrician class and more emblematic of Philadelphia\u2019s Main Line than its row home neighborhoods. That image began to change as an assertive political and cultural shift in white, blue-collar politics arose in response to a series of challenges to the city\u2019s white, blue-collar traditions and institutions.\nAs historian Jefferson Cowie has argued, the 1970s were \u201cthe last days of the working class.\u201d He also argues that despite an increasingly diverse working class, the cultural idea of a blue-collar worker was primarily white and male, so much so that \u201c[b]y the 1980s, \u2018working class\u2019\u2026had evolved into a label for a hardened form of white, male identity politics.\u201d As I further show in my own work on Philadelphia in the 1970s, blue-collar identity politics also became a chief means of obfuscating racial and gendered language in debates over liberal and civil rights policies like school desegregation, public housing, and affirmative action. As explicit appeals to white privilege became publically taboo, whites across the United States began adopting \u201ccolor-blind\u201d discourses. But where middle-class suburbanites and neoconservative intellectuals extolled the virtues of meritocracy to dispute racially inclusive housing, education, and employment policies, working- and middle-class whites in cities like Philadelphia pointed to their blue-collar identities as a means of avoiding racial dialogues.\nFor example, when civil rights activists forced the Pennsylvania to issue school desegregation guidelines for Philadelphia, blue-collar whites responded not with calls for whites-only education but appeals to the sanctity of their neighborhoods. When a South Philadelphia community activist protested a desegregation plan, she told a Board of Education hearing that her local neighborhood school had \u201cserved the children of longshoremen, firemen, policemen, and other working people for generations.\u201d Keenly aware of accusations that communities like hers were racist, she further explained that her community\u2019s opposition to the desegregation plan was not about race, but the value of her neighborhood\u2019s \u201cclosely knit community.\u201d At the same time, as civil rights activists pushed for more affordable housing options for poor people of color, another white, blue-collar South Philadelphia neighborhood sustained a long and acrimonious fight over the construction of a public housing project. They too adopted the ostensibly color-blind language of blue-collar neighborhood sanctity. Community leaders insisted that their opposition to the public housing complex was not the prospective race of its tenants, but that its occupants would not have earned their homes through \u201chard work.\u201d As one community representative explained, \u201cwhen people get something for free they treat it like junk.\u201d But, conscious of the public perception, she added, \u201cWe\u2019re not racists. Why, we had good colored people living here until the city took their houses.\u201d[1] This turn toward blue-collar identity politics to avoid discussing the racial implications of educational or housing policies not only represented a shift in white working-class politics, it also strengthened a local cultural identity that found expression in the city\u2019s sports culture and laid the groundwork for Philadelphia\u2019s renewed civic identity.\nThe rise of this class-forward rhetoric in response to civil rights challenges began to remake the city\u2019s image when it found currency in the greatest example of the Philadelphia\u2019s ascendant blue-collar politics: Mayor Frank Rizzo. Prior to his mayoralty, Rizzo had been a police officer, arguably one of the most blue-collar occupations in the city. He had risen through the ranks rapidly, from beat cop to deputy commissioner and eventually to police commissioner in 1967. From that post Rizzo earned a national reputation for his tough stance on crime, the heavy-handed tactics of his police force, and his openly hostile treatment of civil rights activists. Yet, despite the accusations of racism that dogged him throughout his career, Rizzo insisted he was no racist. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m not it\u2019s against somebody because they are a Negro or an Irishman or anything else,\u201d Rizzo said in 1967. \u201cHell, I\u2019m Italian. I\u2019ve known a lot of good Negro cops.\u201d Like other blue-collar Philadelphians, Rizzo pointed to his blue-collar identity as proof of his colorblindness. Just as importantly for his political career, Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar whites identified with the get-tough cop. One supporter told a reporter that Rizzo would win his first election in 1971 because \u201cHe\u2019s one of us. Rizzo came up the hard way.\u201d To his supporters, Rizzo was as blue-collar as they were, so they overwhelmingly supported his election bids. Thanks to their support, Rizzo not only served two terms as mayor, he also remade the city\u2019s identity. By 1977, the mayor was confident in declaring before an assembly of loyal labor union members that Philadelphia \u201cis now a blue-collar city.\u201d\nSomewhat ironically, the rise of blue-collar identity politics coincided with a decline in Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar economic base. Like cities all across the country, deindustrialization, industrial flight, and a declining national economy wreaked havoc on traditionally working-class jobs. Local industries had been searching for lower taxes and cheaper workforces in the union-weak suburbs or Sunbelt South for decades. By the 1970s industrial relocation began to sap the city\u2019s manufacturing strength. Likewise, while record-high federal spending in the Philadelphia area had made construction work one of the most lucrative blue-collar employment options in the 1960s\u2014so much so that it set off a confrontation between civil rights activists and white construction unions over equal opportunity employment that led to the enactment of the nation\u2019s first fully-formed affirmative action program, the so-called Philadelphia Plan\u2014the sagging economy of the 1970s ended several large-scale public works projects. Even as Frank Rizzo and his blue-collar supporters represented the ascendancy of blue-collar identity politics, the Rizzo administration oversaw the reinvention of the city\u2019s economy. While Rizzo spent the 1970s attacking programs like public housing and affirmative action that he said gave \u201cspecial privileges\u201d to nonwhites, his team of talented economic advisors attracted new businesses and established policies that helped transform Philadelphia into a center of the health care and pharmaceutical industries. The city was in the midst of shifting from a reliance on light industry and manufacturing to a more white-collar and service sector economy. Frank Rizzo might not have been able to declare Philadelphia a \u201cblue-collar city\u201d if not for the rise of an equally powerful blue-collar ideal in the city\u2019s sports culture.\nBlue-Collar Sports and Civic Identity\nDrawing inspiration and identity from the city\u2019s professional sports teams was nothing new for Philadelphians in the 1970s. The triumphs and setbacks of the Phillies and Eagles had long taken on larger social and cultural meaning. By the 1970s, however, both teams had suffered years of losing records that left fans disgruntled, perhaps best represented by the infamous incident at the end of an especially disappointing 1969 Eagles\u2019 season when Philadelphians booed and pelted Santa Claus with snowballs. While that particular story is much more complicated than the one sports announcers drum up whenever they want to lampoon Philadelphia fans, it nevertheless hints at the passion behind the city\u2019s sports fandom in the 1960s and 1970s. By then, however, a new obsession rose to win the loyalties of Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar sports fans: the Philadelphia Flyers.\nEd Snider, a part owner of the Eagles, brought the Flyers to Philadelphia as part of the National Hockey League\u2019s (NHL) 1967 expansion, the same year Frank Rizzo took the reins of the police department. Convincing the city to subsidize the construction of the Philadelphia Spectrum\u2014a $12 million stadium near the intersection of Broad Street and Pattison Avenue in blue-collar South Philadelphia\u2014Snider hoped to get local fans invested in the new team. While Flyers struggled at first, they steadily built a fan base. When the team began signing or trading for new players known for size and toughness, their popularity exploded. In 1969, the Flyers drafted team captain and scoring leader Bobby Clarke along with defenseman Dave \u201cthe Hammer\u201d Schultz, who earned a reputation for spending nearly as much time in the penalty box as on the ice (by the time he retired Schultz had the all-time record for penalty minutes). The following year, the Flyers drafted Bob \u201cMad Dog\u201d Kelly, who amassed an equally impressive number of penalty time. In 1973, the Flyers re-acquired original goalie and fan favorite Bernie Parent (as fans excitedly claimed, \u201cOnly the Lord saves more than Bernie Parent\u201d). Don Saleski, Andre \u201cMoose\u201d Dupont, Bill Barber, and Reggie Leach rounded out the roster that redefined the Flyers for the 1970s. The new squad played with a special intensity. They intimidated opponents with hard and frequent hits and used fighting as a game strategy. Hockey was already a violent sport, but the Flyers played with an unseen level of aggressiveness. After a particularly brutal game against the Atlanta Flames in January 1973, two local sports writers gave the team a nickname that stuck with them for the rest of the era: the \u201cBroad Street Bullies.\u201d Indeed, the 1993 Phillies\u2019 \u201cBroad Street Bellies\u201d nickname was an homage to the team that first captured what it meant to be a \u201cblue-collar team\u201d in a \u201cblue-collar city.\u201d\nNo team represented Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar culture more than the Broad Street Bullies. Their style of play established that, but so did their off-the-ice antics. The team built a culture of comradery intended to make them as close-knit as any blue-collar neighborhood. They often gathered together at Rexy\u2019s, a watering whole just across the Delaware River in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. According to hockey historian John Wong, \u201cRexy\u2019s became a second locker room for the players where they could live and behave in a hypermasculine world.\u201d Fans could see their local sports heroes living their team culture. For a time, that relatability made the Flyers the most popular professional sports team in Philadelphia, especially among blue-collar whites.\nLike they did with Frank Rizzo, blue-collar whites identified with the Flyers because they could see a bit of themselves in the team. The overwhelming whiteness of hockey also reaffirmed the racial subtext of blue-collar identity politics, but without explicitly saying so. Further, in an ultramasculine sport that rewarded violence, the Broad Street Bullies exemplified the equally significant gendered connotations of blue-collar identity. More than that, they became real-life blue-collar heroes when they twice won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975. When the city threw a parade after their first championship, they were accompanied by blue-collar whites\u2019 other local hero, Frank Rizzo. The Broad Street Bullies\u2019 success validated the city\u2019s blue-collar culture and helped solidify the new identity Rizzo represented.\nThe Broad Street Bullies offered a triumphant symbol of Philadelphia\u2019s emerging civic identity, but they were not alone. On the heels of their success, another figure emerged to epitomize that identity and culture on an even broader scale. The release of the 1976 motion picture Rocky introduced the most iconic and longstanding symbol of the city\u2019s identity and sports culture. The movie captured the feel of the Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar neighborhoods better than any other cultural product of the era. An indelible product of those neighborhoods, the movie\u2019s title character was a walking, talking blue-collar stereotype. Rocky Balboa lived in a never-specified working class neighborhood. He trained at a run-down gym in a run-down neighborhood underneath a run-down elevated train. It was this background that set the tone for Balboa\u2019s floundering boxing career and the one-in-a-million shot at the heavyweight title that drove the film\u2019s plot.\nRocky Balboa perfectly captured Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar culture in the mid-1970s. He shared Frank Rizzo\u2019s ethnic heritage and, in a culture where white ethnic background mattered deeply, the film had Balboa fight under the nickname \u201cthe Italian Stallion.\u201d Rocky did not have access to advanced technology or training techniques, which meant he had to work hard to overcome his shortcomings. When not boxing, he struggled to make ends meet and took odd jobs as a dockworker and muscle for a loan shark. Rocky also surrounded himself with blue-collar archetypes. His friend Paulie worked in a meat-packing plant, which allowed Rocky a venue for his unconventional training regimen of using a frozen beef slab as a makeshift punching bag. Rocky was not only Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar identity personified, he also captured the racial and gendered politics of blue-collar identity. The heavyweight champion and Rocky\u2019s main opponent was Apollo Creed, a loud, brash, overly confident African American boxer cast in the unmistakable mold of Muhammad Ali. When Rocky fought Apollo in the film\u2019s final sequence\u2014staged at the Philadelphia Spectrum\u2014he fought for all blue-collar Philadelphians looking for redemption after the pitched battles they had engaged during the past decade. Rocky ultimately lost the bout, but not before giving Apollo Creed the fight of his life and securing his place not only in popular culture but also in Philadelphia sports legend. Despite being a fictional character, Rocky has been celebrated as much as any real-life athlete in the city. Indeed, historian Jamie Shultz has argued that Rocky Balboa is \u201cPhiladelphia\u2019s greatest sports hero.\u201d\nBoth Rocky and the Broad Street Bullies offered white, blue-collar Philadelphians vicarious triumphs in the 1970s. They also took on greater meaning in the context of Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar moment. Blue-collar whites cheered both for defying odds, but also for representing their cultural identity in the same way Frank Rizzo did\u2014as hypermasculine representations of blue-collar whiteness. Furthermore, as Rocky Balboa and the Broad Street Bullies became symbols of Philadelphia\u2019s blue-collar sports culture, they also secured the remaking of the city\u2019s civic identity for years to come. To this day, before kickoff of every Eagles\u2019 home game at Lincoln Financial Field, the stadium\u2019s public address system readies the hometown crowd by playing a scene from Rocky II. It opens with Rocky sitting at his wife Adrienne\u2019s bedside. After urging her aging and ailing husband not to grant Apollo Creed a rematch earlier in the film, Adrienne fell into a coma. When she collapses, Rocky stops training and spends a classic Rocky-film montage at her side. The scene that finally greets fans on game day begins with Adrienne coming out of her coma. Having had a change of heart, she tells Rocky \u201cthere\u2019s one thing I want you to do for me\u2026.Win.\u201d\nPhiladelphians fans know the scene from Rocky II without the deeper context. It resonates because Rocky has become as much a part of Philadelphia\u2019s sports culture as any real athlete. As a result, everything about the display of this scene\u2014as well as the Rocky training montage intercut with Eagles\u2019 highlights played over the Rocky theme song that follows\u2014reinforces the blue-collar civic identity that Rocky Balboa, the Broad Street Bullies, Frank Rizzo, and his blue-collar supporters established in the 1970s.\nWhither Philadelphia\u2019s Blue-Collar Identity?\nPhiladelphia\u2019s professional sports helped secure that blue-collar civic identity and maintained it well past the decline of the city\u2019s industrial heyday. In doing so, they also reinforced the racial, class, and gender politics of the 1970s that originally birthed blue-collar identity politics. Yet the Eagles\u2019 engagement with this civic identity further complicates its political and cultural meaning. The 2017 Eagles hardly fit the standards of blue-collar identity established in the 1970s. The team was majority African American. More importantly, they were one of the most politically progressive and socially active teams in the NFL. When The Nation\u2019s Dave Zirin made \u201cThe Progressive Case for the Philadelphia Eagles\u201d to NFL fans, he listed the political activism several players took on during the season. Safety Malcom Jenkins helped form the Players Coalition to enlist owner support for funding efforts to combat racial inequality. After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, defensive lineman and Charlottesville native Chris Long donated his entire season\u2019s salary to scholarship funds intended counter the hate and bigotry on display in his hometown. While no Eagle kneeled for the national anthem during the regular season, several continued to show support for fight against police brutality and racial injustice by standing for the anthem with their clenched fists raised. Whenever Jenkins raised his fist, Long stood at his side and put his hand on Jenkins\u2019s shoulder in his own show of solidarity. The Guardian even went so far to call the Eagles \u201cthe NFL\u2019s wokest team.\u201d\nThe 2017 Eagles\u2019 activism culminated with several players refusing to attend the traditional Super Bowl victory celebration at the White House. When Donald Trump subsequently disinvited the entire team, he highlighted the complicated evolution of blue-collar politics. Throughout his campaign for presidency, Trump invoked a number of blue-collar tropes and imagery. At a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, Donald Trump Jr. referred to his father Trump as a \u201cblue-collar billionaire.\u201d Trump even drew a number of comparisons to Philadelphia\u2019s old blue-collar hero, Frank Rizzo. After winning the election, Trump continued invoking these images by promising to bring back traditionally blue-collar jobs that had long succumbed to automation and staging photo ops with bikers, truckers, and other blue-collar archetypes. By the time the Eagles made it to their first Super Bowl, Trump had become the new symbol for the kind of blue-collar politics that had emerged in the Eagles\u2019 home city during the 1970s.\nDespite this shift, local figures like Ed Rendell and national publications like the New York Times still invoked Philadelphia and the Eagles\u2019 blue-collar identity. Perhaps the Super Bowl champion Eagles are evidence that the city\u2019s blue-collar sports culture has separated from its blue-collar politics of the 1970s. Or maybe the connotations that allowed Philadelphia to become a \u201cblue-collar city\u201d have dissipated in the ensuing decades. In either case, however, as long as people continue to refer to Philadelphia and its professional sports franchises as \u201cblue-collar,\u201d they will be invoking a civic identity that emerged out of the intersection of local political and sports history. It is a shared history that has created a lasting if complicated and often contradictory legacy. Blue-collar identity, then and now, is steeped shifting political and cultural meaning. The New York Times may ponder whether Philadelphia can maintain its blue-collar identity, but it is likely that it will remain as common as the stock footage of cheese steaks and the Rocky statue that accompany every sporting event nationally broadcasted from the city. It would be better to ask what we mean when we call a city or a team \u201cblue-collar.\nTimothy J. Lombardo is a Philadelphia native, Philly sports fan, and Assistant Professor of History at the University of South Alabama.

As women took on leadership roles in blue-collar battles over housing and education, their toughness and protectionism became key parts of blue-collar identity even as their political language highlighted a decidedly male blue-collar ideal.\nPingback: Weekend Reads (September 15-16) | Matt Edmonds\nGreat insight, worthy article!

      "text": "The postwar United States has experienced many forms of populist politics, none more consequential than that of the blue-collar white ethnics who brought figures like Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump to the White House. Blue-Collar Conservatism traces the rise of this little-understood, easily caricatured variant of populism by presenting a nuanced portrait of the supporters of Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo.\nIn 1971, Frank Rizzo became the first former police commissioner elected mayor of a major American city. Despite serving as a Democrat, Rizzo cultivated his base of support by calling for \"law and order\" and opposing programs like public housing, school busing, affirmative action, and other policies his supporters deemed unearned advantages for nonwhites. Out of this engagement with the interwoven politics of law enforcement, school desegregation, equal employment, and urban housing, Timothy J. Lombardo argues, blue-collar populism arose.\nBased on extensive archival research, and with an emphasis on interrelated changes to urban space and blue-collar culture, Blue-Collar Conservatism challenges the familiar backlash narrative, instead contextualizing blue-collar politics within postwar urban and economic crises. Historian and Philadelphia-native Lombardo demonstrates how blue-collar whites did not immediately abandon welfare liberalism but instead selectively rejected liberal policies based on culturally defined ideas of privilege, disadvantage, identity, and entitlement. While grounding his analysis in the postwar era's familiar racial fissures, Lombardo also emphasizes class identity as an indispensable driver of blue-collar political engagement. Blue-Collar Conservatism ultimately shows how this combination of factors created one of the least understood but most significant political developments in recent American history."

      "text": "When people use the term \u201cOrwellian,\u201d it\u2019s not a good sign.\nIt usually characterizes an action, an individual or a society that is suppressing freedom, particularly the freedom of expression. It can also describe something perverted by tyrannical power.\nIt\u2019s a term used primarily to describe the present, but whose implications inevitably connect to both the future and the past.\nIn his second term, President Donald Trump has revealed his ambitions to rewrite America\u2019s official history to, in the words of the Organization of American Historians, \u201creflect a glorified narrative \u2026 while suppressing the voices of historically excluded groups.\u201d\nThis ambition was manifested in efforts by the Department of Education to eradicate a \u201cDEI agenda\u201d from school curricula. It also included a high-profile assault on what detractors saw as \u201cwoke\u201d universities, which culminated in Columbia University\u2019s agreement to submit to a review of the faculty and curriculum of its Middle Eastern Studies department, with the aim of eradicating alleged pro-Palestinian bias.\nNow, the administration has shifted its sights from formal educational institutions to one of the key sites of public history-making: the Smithsonian, a collection of 21 museums, the National Zoo and associated research centers, principally centered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\nOn Aug. 12, 2025, the Smithsonian\u2019s director, Lonnie Bunch III, received a letter from the White House announcing its intent to carry out a systematic review of the institution\u2019s holdings and exhibitions in the advance of the nation\u2019s 250th anniversary in 2026.\nThe review\u2019s stated aim is to ensure that museum content adequately reflects \u201cAmericanism\u201d through a commitment to \u201ccelebrate American exceptionalism, [and] remove divisive or partisan narratives.\u201d\nOn Aug. 19, 2025, Trump escalated his attack on the Smithsonian. \u201cThe Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was\u2026\u201d he wrote in a Truth Social post. \u201cNothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future. We are not going to allow this to happen.\u201d\nSuch ambitions may sound benign, but they are deeply Orwellian. Here\u2019s how.\nWinners write the history\nAuthor George Orwell believed in objective, historical truth. Writing in 1946, he attributed his youthful desire to become an author in part to a \u201chistorical impulse,\u201d or \u201cthe desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.\u201d\nBut while Orwell believed in the existence of an objective truth about history, he did not necessarily believe that truth would prevail.\nTruth, Orwell recognized, was best served by free speech and dialogue. Yet absolute power, Orwell appreciated, allowed those who possessed it to silence or censor opposing narratives, quashing the possibility of productive dialogue about history that could ultimately allow truth to come out.\nAs Orwell wrote in \u201c1984,\u201d his final, dystopian novel, \u201cWho controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.\u201d\nHistorian Malgorzata Rymsza-Pawlowska has written about America\u2019s bicentennial celebrations that took place in 1976. Then, she says, \u201cAmericans across the nation helped contribute to a pluralistic and inclusive commemoration \u2026 using it as a moment to question who had been left out of the legacies of the American Revolution, to tell more inclusive stories about the history of the United States.\u201d\nThis was an example of the kind of productive dialogue encouraged in a free society. \u201cBy contrast,\u201d writes Rymsza-Pawlowska, \u201cthe 250th is shaping up to be a top-down affair that advances a relatively narrow and celebratory idea of Americanism.\u201d The newly announced Smithsonian review aims to purge counternarratives that challenge that celebratory idea.\nThe Ministry of Truth\nThe desire to eradicate counternarratives drives Winston Smith\u2019s job at the ironically named Ministry of Truth in \u201c1984.\u201d\nThe novel is set in Oceania, a geographical entity covering North America and the British Isles and which governs much of the Global South.\nOceania is an absolute tyranny governed by Big Brother, the leader of a political party whose only goal is the perpetuation of its own power. In this society, truth is what Big Brother and the party say it is.\nThe regime imposes near total censorship so that not only dissident speech but subversive private reflection, or \u201cthought crime,\u201d is viciously prosecuted. In this way, it controls the present.\nBut it also controls the past. As the party\u2019s protean policy evolves, Smith and his colleagues are tasked with systematically destroying any historical records that conflict with the current version of history. Smith literally disposes of artifacts of inexpedient history by throwing them down \u201cmemory holes,\u201d where they are \u201cwiped \u2026 out of existence and out of memory.\u201d\nAt a key point in the novel, Smith recalls briefly holding on to a newspaper clipping that proved that an enemy of the regime had not actually committed the crime he had been accused of. Smith recognizes the power over the regime that this clipping gives him, but he simultaneously fears that power will make him a target. In the end, fear of retaliation leads him to drop the slip of newsprint down a memory hole.\nThe contemporary U.S. is a far cry from Orwell\u2019s Oceania. Yet the Trump administration is doing its best to exert control over the present and the past.\nDown the memory hole\nEven before the Trump administration announced its review of the Smithsonian, officials in departments across government had taken unprecedented steps to rewrite the nation\u2019s official history, attempting to purge parts of the historical narrative down Orwellian memory holes.\nComically, those efforts included the temporary removal from government websites of information about the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. The plane was unwittingly caught up in a mass purge of references to \u201cgay\u201d and LGBTQ+ content on government websites.\nOther erasures have included the deletion of content on government sites related to the life ofHarriet Tubman, the Maryland woman who escaped slavery and then played a pioneering role as a conductor of the Underground Railroad, helping enslaved people escape to freedom.\nPublic outcry led to the restoration of most of the deleted content.\nOver at the Smithsonian, which earlier in the year had been criticized by Trump for its \u201cdivisive, race-centered ideology,\u201d staff removed a temporary placard with references to President Trump\u2019s two impeachment trials from a display case on impeachment that formed part of the National Museum of American History exhibition on the American presidency. The references to Trump\u2019s two impeachments were modified, with some details removed, in a newly installed placard in the updated display.\nResponding to questions, the Smithsonian stated that the placard\u2019s removal was not in response to political pressure: \u201cThe placard, which was meant to be a temporary addition to a 25-year-old exhibition, did not meet the museum\u2019s standards in appearance, location, timeline, and overall presentation.\u201d\nRepressing thought\nOrwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d ends with an appendix on the history of \u201cNewspeak,\u201d Oceania\u2019s official language, which, while it had not yet superseded \u201cOldspeak\u201d or standard English, was rapidly gaining ground as both a written and spoken dialect.\nAccording to the appendix, \u201cThe purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of [the Party], but to make all other modes of thought impossible.\u201d\nOrwell, as so often in his writing, makes the abstract theory concrete: \u201cThe word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as \u2018This dog is free from lice\u2019 or \u2018This field is free from weeds.\u2019 \u2026 political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts.\u201d\nThe goal of this language streamlining was total control over past, present and future.\nIf it is illegal to even speak of systemic racism, for example, let alone discuss its causes and possible remedies, it constrains the potential for, even prohibits, social change.\nIt has become a clich\u00e9 that those who do not understand history are bound to repeat it.\nAs George Orwell appreciated, the correlate is that social and historical progress require an awareness of, and receptivity to, both historical fact and competing historical narratives.\nThis story is an updated version of an article originally published on June 9, 2025.\nThe Smithsonian is a member of The Conversation U.S."

The treatment of these communities under Mr. Rizzo\u2019s leadership was among the worst periods in Philadelphia\u2019s history. The battle for equal rights and justice is still being fought decades later, and our city is still working to erase that legacy.

      "text": "How White Backlash Controls American Progress\nBacklash dynamics are one of the defining patterns of the country\u2019s history.\nUpdated at 10:41 a.m. ET on May 22, 2020.\nThe word backlash gained popularity in the summer of 1963, when, after dallying on the issue for the first two years of his presidency, President John F. Kennedy proposed significant civil-rights legislation. In response, the word, which had primarily denoted the recoil of a fishing line, was repurposed, usually as \u201cwhite backlash,\u201d to refer to opposition to the increased pace of African American civil-rights activism or the Kennedy (and, after his assassination in November 1963, the Lyndon B. Johnson) administration\u2019s legislative proposals and executive actions, or both.\nIn 1966, a commentator, speaking of \u201cthe grand new word, backlash,\u201d claimed without much exaggeration that \u201cjust about everything that happened could be (and was) attributed to some form of backlash.\u201d The word came to stand for a topsy-turvy rebellion in which white people with relative societal power perceived themselves as victimized by what they described as overly aggressive African Americans demanding equal rights. Backlash, as the New York Times columnist Tom Wicker wrote, \u201cis nothing more nor less than white resentment of Negroes.\u201d\nMoving beyond an opposition to civil rights, the word backlash\u2014less frequently qualified as \u201cwhite\u201d\u2014quickly became a synonym for a new and growing conservative force, signifying a virulent counterreaction to all manner of social movements and cultural transformations that became central to American politics. Over time, observers noted manifestations of this reaction in a \u201cSouthern backlash,\u201d a \u201cmale backlash,\u201d a \u201cheterosexual backlash,\u201d a \u201cproperty tax backlash\u201d and a \u201cbacklash against environmentalists.\u201d Just a month after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, a journalist described the United States as being in the midst of \u201ca multitude of backlashes.\u201d But as one commentator pointed out, \u201cThe word which gave rise to all sorts of other \u2018lashes\u2019 was coined in reference to white opposition to Negro gains.\u201d\nBacklash may have burst onto the scene as \u201cthe word of the year in American politics\u201d in 1964, but it described one of the oldest and deepest patterns in American politics, one that is once again playing out today in the right-wing campaign against social distancing. Backlashes appear as seemingly serial and discrete events\u2014against the civil-rights movement in the 1960s, or the women\u2019s movement in the \u201970s, or the gay-rights movement in the \u201990s. But this obscures an underlying continuity: These individual backlashes are all instances of a reactionary tradition, one that is deeply woven into American political culture and that extends back to the era of Reconstruction, at least. And the backlashes are powerful not only for the fury they represent, but in the fear they instill in political leaders, even progressives, who hesitate to push things \u201ctoo far.\u201d\nDuring Reconstruction, opponents of the black-freedom struggle deployed preemptive, apocalyptic, slippery-slope arguments that have remained enduring features of backlash politics up to the present. They treated federal support for African American civil rights, economic and social equality\u2014however delayed, reluctant, underfunded, and incomplete it may have been\u2014as a cataclysmic overreaction and framed it as a far more dangerous threat to liberty than the injustice it was designed to address. In 1867, not even two years after ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle decried the placement of political power \u201cin the hands of a property-less and ignorant class of the population,\u201d and pronounced that \u201cthe pending Reconstruction scheme must be abandoned.\u201d\nSince then, such framing has done more than merely shape the politics of reaction in the United States; it has also constrained putatively supportive political leaders, who live in fear of setting off backlashes. Responding to a moderate plan to enfranchise only free blacks in Louisiana in 1864, the Union general Nathaniel P. Banks, worrying about a negative response from the state\u2019s whites, who were being defeated in the Civil War, said, \u201cRevolutions which are not controlled and held within reasonable limits produce counter-revolution.\u201d That obeisance to a defeated group in 1864 was an extreme version of a general pattern that has remained a hallmark of backlashes ever since: solicitousness to white fears.\nFor many white backlashers in the 1960s, the era of what the historian C. Vann Woodward called the \u201csecond Reconstruction,\u201d the first Reconstruction remained a negative model. They viewed its reform as overly fast-paced, and felt that it foregrounded black civil rights at the cost of white people\u2019s peace of mind. They associated civil-rights activism with what popular historians and commentators of the day called the \u201cexcesses\u201d of Reconstruction, by which they meant a combination of \u201cmilitant\u201d African American demands for basic equality with overweening, aggressive, and hasty federal action in support of interracial democracy. Thurman Sensing of the Southern States Industrial Council, a conservative business group, described the civil-rights movement in 1966 as an effort to force \u201cthe Reconstruction of American customs,\u201d showing the degree to which the post\u2013Civil War campaign for racial equality remained a central metaphor for white backlashers. The journalist in December 1963 who noted the political power of those opposed to \u201cNegro pressure for equal opportunity and the Federal Government\u2019s pace on the Civil Rights front,\u201d could just as easily have been describing the origins of the counterrevolution of the 1870s.\nThere was, then, nothing particularly novel about the constituent elements of white backlash to the civil-rights movement: its smoldering resentment, its belief that the movement was proceeding \u201ctoo fast,\u201d its demands for emotional and psychological sympathy, and its displacement of African Americans\u2019 struggles with its own claims of grievance.\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that the white backlash in this case was in place before the passage of the Civil Rights Act in July 1964. The pattern is this: American reactionary politics is nearly always preemptive, predicting catastrophe and highlighting potential slippery slopes. \u201cWhite backlash,\u201d after all, got its name in 1963, just months after African Americans in Birmingham risked attacks from police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses in order to demand justice, and immediately after Kennedy mooted the idea of substantive legislation\u2014both events taking place well before the Civil Rights Act became law. What one reporter called \u201cwhite panic\u201d was driven by fears of \u201cfavoritism\u201d and \u201cspecial privileges\u201d for African Americans\u2014that white \u201cworkers would be forced out of their jobs to make way for Negroes,\u201d as one article put it that year, when Jim Crow still prevailed. \u201cMany of my people think the Negroes want to take over the country,\u201d a midwestern Republican politician said in a Wall Street Journal article published on April 10 of the following year, still months before the Act\u2019s passage. \u201cThey think there are things in the bill that just aren\u2019t there, like forced sales of housing to Negroes and stuff like that.\u201d White backlashers imagined coercion where it did not exist. They embraced a lexicon and posture of victimization that hearkened back to the era of Reconstruction and anticipated the deceiving, self-pitying MAGA discourse that drives reactionary politics in Donald Trump\u2019s America.\nSince Reconstruction, many backlash campaigns have imposed a politics of white fragility and frustration onto racial-equality struggles. Reporting on the \u201chate vote\u201d in The Saturday Evening Post, in October 1964, one month before the presidential election, Ben H. Bagdikian highlighted the \u201cchurning, emotional conflict within each voter,\u201d by which he meant white people. He noted that the backlashers \u201care not against a better life for the Negro, but they are strongly against this being achieved at the cost of white tranquility.\u201d The elevation of \u201ctranquility\u201d over equal justice for all was a hallmark of backlash discourse, which ranked white feelings over black rights.\nBacklashers understood civil rights as zero-sum, and therefore treated campaigns for African American equality as an inexcusable undermining of what they saw as deserved white privileges and prerogatives. A New York Times poll revealed, in condensed form, the emotional landscape of the white backlash: \u201cNorthern white urbanites have no sympathy for the Negro\u2019s plight, and believe the Civil Rights movement has gone too far, while a considerable percentage believes Negroes \u2018don\u2019t appreciate what we\u2019re doing for them.\u2019\u201d The extension of sympathy, such as being in favor of a \u201cbetter life for the Negro,\u201d was, then, conditional on personal convenience and easily withdrawn. \u201cIn general, the persons interviewed were mildly in favor of a better break for Negroes\u2014as long as it wouldn\u2019t affect them personally,\u201d the reporter Dave Allbaugh observed in 1963.\n\u201cToo far. Too fast.\u201d Although Kennedy\u2019s proposal came more than 80 years after the last significant piece of civil-rights legislation was passed in 1875, backlashers often spoke in these terms, deputizing themselves as judges of the proper scope and pace of social change. On February 23, 1964, in The Washington Post, the journalist Robert Baker described the backlash as white \u201cresentment of Negro boycotts and dramatic protests\u201d that they had determined to be \u201cill-advised and unreasonable,\u201d which suggested that white critics should determine the standard for advisable and reasonable protest. They charged African American protesters\u2014who sought to end nearly a century of Jim Crow segregation, lynching, and disenfranchisement, as well as job and housing discrimination\u2014with moving \u201ctoo militantly.\u201d To backlashers, the potential passage of the Civil Rights Act marked the dangerous acceleration of a process that needed to proceed more deliberately, according to their schedule and on their terms. \u201cThere is wide agreement on Capitol Hill that the polls are right in saying that the white majority believes that the Negro is pushing too far, too fast and that the Kennedy administration is trying to do too much to help the Negro,\u201d Chalmers M. Roberts of The Washington Post wrote in October 1963, in the first story of a three-part report on \u201cthe current status of the racial issue in America.\u201d A few months earlier, in his \u201cLetter From a Birmingham Jail,\u201d Martin Luther King Jr. criticized white moderates (\u201cwho have never felt the stinging darts of segregation\u201d) on the ground that their charges of excessive haste were a cover for the racist status quo: \u201cFor years now I have heard the word \u2018Wait!\u2019 It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \u2018Wait\u2019 has almost always meant \u2018Never.\u2019 We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \u2018justice too long delayed is justice denied.\u2019\u201d\nWhite backlashers did not just wallow in their fear, anger, and resentment. In broadcasting these feelings widely, they shaped the limits of acceptable reform. Recommending a \u201cgo-slow course,\u201d they could extend sympathy or not, and sought to determine when equal rights crossed the line into \u201cspecial privileges.\u201d A reporter noted \u201cthe apprehension of suburbanites and others in white neighborhoods that their residential areas will face an influx of Negroes.\u201d In this worldview, whites presented themselves as victims, the crimes perpetrated against them by campaigns for equality were anxiety, inconvenience, and fear. Long before the passage of the Civil Rights Act, a politician told the Post\u2019s Roberts in October 1963, \u201cFor the first time, I\u2019m getting mail from white people saying, \u2018Wait a minute, we\u2019ve got rights too.\u2019\u201d The \u201ctoo\u201d was especially telling because at that time a large number of African Americans still lacked federal protection for basic civil and voting rights.\nThe \u201cwhite backlash\u201d thus produced a politics of displacement, shifting the focus from those denied equality under the law and demanding justice to those who imagined threat or inconvenience in the possibility of social change. In September 1963, the Dayton Daily News highlighted the \u201cNorthern whites who are growing increasingly jittery as the wave of Negro protest washes home on their doorstep,\u201d and in November of that same year, the Los Angeles Times noted \u201cthe welter of ill-feeling generated by Negro marches and sit-ins.\u201d The feelings that mattered were those of white people.\nThe reporting on the backlash foregrounded white fears and anxieties in a way that coverage of African Americans rarely did. Jerry Landauer\u2019s April 1964 report for the Wall Street Journal highlighted white people\u2019s \u201cemotion-laden struggle,\u201d appropriating even the word struggle to describe the psychological challenges for white Americans of adjusting to the possibility of racial equality. Landauer noted \u201cthe intense resentment of large blocs of whites in the North,\u201d which was amplified by the likelihood that the Civil Rights Act might actually become law (which it did in July). \u201cTo them, the bill has become a symbol of fear\u2014fear of losing jobs to Negroes; fear that neighborhood schools will be flooded by Negro kids \u2018bussed in\u2019 from across town; fear that homeowners will be forced to sell, if they wish to sell at all, to Negro newcomers.\u201d These were fears of the consequences of African American equality, framed as unfair victimization.\nThroughout what we might call the \u201cbacklash era,\u201d African Americans offered a clear-eyed analysis and robust critique of backlashes and white defenses of them, taking them to be, as the ex-baseball star and longtime activist Jackie Robinson put it in a 1966 New York Amsterdam News article, \u201ca great big fat alibi for bigotry.\u201d Whereas many white observers in the early 1960s highlighted the novelty of white backlash, Martin Luther King Jr. more accurately called it \u201ca new name for an old phenomenon\u201d that \u201chad always existed underneath and sometimes on the surface of American life.\u201d Langston Hughes wrote a poem, \u201cThe Backlash Blues,\u201d which Nina Simone later set to music and recorded.\nPerhaps Lorraine Hansberry most directly put her finger on the issue in a June 1964 talk titled \u201cThe Black Revolution and the White Backlash,\u201d which she gave at the Town Hall in New York City. She spoke during an event organized by the Association of Artists for Freedom, a group of African American artists and intellectuals, about two weeks before the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Pointing to the long history of the black-liberation struggle, Hansberry said, \u201cThe charge of impatience is simply unbearable.\u201d Her request to the \u201cwhite liberal to stop being a liberal and to become a radical\u201d was largely a call for those liberals to recognize that the true victims of racism were not resentful white Americans but African Americans demanding equality.\nIn the short run, the media spotlight on the white backlash of 1963\u201364 appeared to have been spectacularly misplaced. The movement proved to be an electoral failure, one almost immediately demonstrated to have been on the wrong side of history. Not only did the Civil Rights Act pass in 1964, but later that year, Lyndon B. Johnson won an overwhelming election victory, leading him to speculate that a \u201cfrontlash\u201d of civil-rights support was far more significant than what he labeled the \u201cso-called backlash,\u201d which suffered crushing double defeats that year. Johnson predicted at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City that \u201cfor every backlash that the Democrats lose, we pick up three frontlash [votes],\u201d and his shellacking of Barry Goldwater on Election Day seemed to prove him correct.\nBut, as Johnson was also well aware, the forces of backlash were far from defeated. \u201cI think we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come,\u201d LBJ told Bill Moyers, his press aide, shortly after he signed the Civil Rights Act. With the hindsight that history offers, we can see that Goldwater\u2019s campaign was less a sign of the backlash\u2019s vanquishing than a harbinger of modern conservatism. In 1966, the influential columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak called white backlash \u201ca permanent feature of the political scene,\u201d where it has remained ever since.\nUsing the same phrase that General Banks had employed a century earlier, but to different purposes, a columnist wrote that the proper way to understand white backlash was as \u201ca counter-revolution against the black man.\u201d Counterrevolution is a phrase that Americans rarely use to describe our politics. But it is not unfair or inaccurate to apply this label to white backlash, whose explicit goal was to slow or halt the civil-rights revolution.\nThe backlashers lost a number of key political battles in the 1960s, the decade in which they got their name. From Reconstruction to the New Deal, they had been vanquished before, and they\u2019ve been defeated more recently, too, in a variety of areas\u2014LBGTQ rights, for example. But both before and since, the preemptive politics of grievance and anti-egalitarianism they championed, whereby the psychology of privilege takes center stage while the needs of the oppressed are forced to wait in the wings, has left a deforming and reactionary imprint on our political culture. It has done so not just by emboldening reactionaries but by making the fear of setting off backlashes a standard element of the political conversation.\nConsider, as examples, when last year the economist Larry Summers tweeted about the dangers of a wealth tax \u201cboomerang,\u201d and David Brooks warned about the \u201cugly backlash\u201d that would likely follow an impeachment trial. Or, in a similar vein, when the columnist Ross Douthat wrote that if the Democrats adopt the Green New Deal, it \u201cwill empower climate-change skeptics, weaken the hand of would-be compromisers in the GOP\u201d and \u201cpossibly help Donald Trump win re-election.\u201d In this way, backlash politics has become a constraint on modern liberalism.\nBacklash dynamics have played out over and over again through the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st. They appeared in the reaction against the women\u2019s movement\u2014which, as Mary Wiegers wrote in 1970, faced a \u201cbuilt-in backlash\u201d before it even got started\u2014that culminated in the successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment as it came close to becoming law. Such dynamics remained central to campaigns against social provisions, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in the 1980s and \u201990s, and have been reflected in the genre of \u201cangry white male\u201d movies, including Falling Down and Gran Torino. More recently, and more consequentially, these forces helped elect Donald Trump, who framed his campaign and continues to treat his presidency as a backlash against his predecessor, Barack Obama, the first African American president.\nThe backlashers have been out in force at recent anti-social-distancing protests, which have been dominated by white people proclaiming that public-health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are robbing them of their birthright of liberty. Making the connection to prior backlashes explicit, some protesters have waved Confederate flags and held signs that read Give me liberty or give me death. While in some ways laughable, given their complaints about being unable to get a haircut or having to \u201cget two iced teas in the drive thru,\u201d some of the protesters also incite fear, with their ostentatious weapon-wielding and threats of violence, to say nothing of their willingness to potentially infect others with the coronavirus. Drawing upon the template of the backlashes of earlier historic moments, these protesters, too, combine the paranoia and insecurity that have long warped our political culture with acclamations of freedom for some at the expense of freedom for all. As during Reconstruction and the civil-rights era, we face once again the danger that a politics of freedom and equality may be eclipsed by the psychology of white resentment.\n* A photo caption in this article previously misstated the date the photo was taken.

      "text": "On the night of July 5, 1971, residents of the Whitman neighborhood in South Philadelphia embarked on a campaign of systemic vandalism. A crowd of several hundred people marched on a vast vacant lot in the southeastern corner of the neighborhood.\nThe muddy tract, strewn with rubble and construction equipment, covered several city blocks. It was surrounded by a 6-foot-high plywood fence. The lot was a definite eyesore, but the residents considered it preferable to the project slated for the space: 120 units of public housing in a project named Whitman Park.\nMore than 80 percent of the neighborhood\u2019s residents owned their homes. Their values might not have been appreciating, but they weren\u2019t declining either. In many cases, those little row houses were all Whitman\u2019s working-class residents had in terms of assets. In that context, bringing public housing to their corner of the city seemed an existential threat. And they were going to do something about it.\nTwo contingents of police were dispatched to protect the construction site that night, but they arrived too late and, in any case, did not leave their vehicles. That decision was prudent for both the physical health of the police\u2014a June memo from the commissioner warned that confronting the protesters would result in a \u201cblood bath\u201d\u2014and the political health of their superiors. 1971 was an election year in which the city\u2019s Democratic Party was trying to win back the row house white vote from Richard Nixon and his law-and-order Republican progeny.\nBut 10 years after the neighborhood attacked the fence, and 25 years after the integrationist project was conceived, the housing was built. Today the long, nasty fight is largely forgotten except by those old enough to have witnessed it.\nPhiladelphia is still one of the most segregated cities in one of the most segregated regions in the nation. In the 1950s, housing reformers and good-government liberals tried to advance integration in the region with a plan to build 21 new public housing projects in predominantly white communities for those on the long waitlist\u2014who were already 90 percent Black by 1957. The effort failed spectacularly in the face of vehement opposition. The eventual construction of Whitman Park was its only, and much belated, victory, won not by politicians or bureaucrats but by a concerted activist campaign and a lawsuit that marked the first successful use of the disparate impact legal theory.\nToday the region\u2019s subsidized affordable housing stock remains as segregated as ever, with most remaining public housing complexes located in low-income African-American neighborhoods. Many of the Housing Choice (Section 8) vouchers and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit\u2013financed housing are also based in these neighborhoods. Recent attempts to equitably share the responsibility for voucher-holding households have failed amid internecine conflicts between local bureaucracies.\nIn this context, the battle over public housing in Whitman Park is worth remembering as one of the Philadelphia region\u2019s only successful attempts to bring racially integrated subsidized housing to a predominantly white neighborhood.\nA Territorial Neighborhood\nThe Whitman neighborhood is deep in South Philadelphia, a section of the city densely packed with two-story pre\u2013World-War-I brick row homes. In the 1970s there were 250,000 people living within its 12-square-mile parameters, which perhaps explains why it has always been one of the most fiercely territorial sections of Philadelphia. (Today there are closer to 150,000 residents.) \u201cYou stayed within the boundaries of your own neighborhood,\u201d remembers Mark Squilla, city councilman and onetime president of the Whitman Council, who grew up a mile to the northwest of Whitman Park. \u201cIf you were at 5th and Porter you wouldn\u2019t go to 3rd and Porter. You stayed in your own area and if you went in one of the other ones you would get in a fight.\u201d\nOne of the ironies of the Whitman Park housing battle is that there had been a very small African-American population nestled in ramshackle houses in the neighborhood. In the late 1950s their homes were destroyed to make way for the new public housing, and opponents used their memory to argue that their opposition to construction wasn\u2019t racially motivated. \u201cWe\u2019re not racists,\u201d claimed Gert Hogan, a fiery Irish-American neighborhood activist in a 1972 Philadelphia Bulletin profile. \u201cWhy, we had good colored people living here until the city took their houses. I wish they were back.\u201d\nThe housing authority\u2019s original plans for the site, however, would have established an entirely different Black presence in the neighborhood. In 1950 the Census tract only contained 402 African-Americans out of a total population of 17,703. Initially the Whitman public housing was meant to be a cluster of high rises for families, containing 260 apartments, dubbed the Delaware Towers. Whitman residents said that such a design would be profoundly alien to a neighborhood of two-story brick row houses, prompting the housing authority to develop a compromise. They reduced the number of units to 120 row houses, chiefly distinguished from their neighbors by small driveways (a valuable amenity in a parking-scarce neighborhood built out before automobile ownership was the norm).\nThe housing authority went even further in its quest to quell neighborhood opposition, altering the very nature of the project. Instead of traditional public housing, the Whitman homes would be operated under the federal \u201cTurnkey III\u201d program. This meant tenants could, after a set period of years, purchase their homes from the housing authority and thus remove them from affordability restrictions and government subsidies.\nThe substantial fruits of polite resistance were already manifest, but they would not be nearly enough to satisfy the homeowners of Whitman.\nIntegration and Backlash\nIn most American cities, public housing constructed in the 1930s\u201350s was almost always segregated by race both in terms of tenancy and neighborhood placement. But by the 1960s, with the civil rights movement in ascendance, pressure for integration began to mount.\nMany housing advocates sought to scatter public housing throughout stable working-class and middle-class white communities that wouldn\u2019t be tipped into poverty by the presence of a few hundred low-income families, who could in turn benefit from safer streets and better amenities.\nLiberal mayors like New York\u2019s John Lindsay took up the cause, not realizing the depth of the resentment such a project would engender in neighborhoods like Queens\u2019 Jewish-dominated Forest Hills. In Philadelphia, the ordeal began in the 1950s, when liberal reformer Richardson Dilworth began the process that would eventually result in Whitman Park, if precious little else. In Washington, D.C., the administration of Richard Nixon was divided on the issue as well, with HUD secretary George Romney advocating for integration despite the political dividends his president saw within the white backlash.\nForest Hills, Whitman Park, and later a similar fight in Yonkers, N.Y., came at a time of growing hostility to civil rights and racial equality, says Tom Sugrue, professor of history and author of Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North. \u201cThe intensity and longevity of the battle is a reminder of how bitterly racially divided Philadelphia was. [Whitman Park] adds to working-class white Philadelphia\u2019s sense of insecurity. Their jobs are going, the economy is tanking. African-American activists are demanding inclusion in city employment and calling for affirmative action. It becomes difficult to disentangle the poisonous mix of concerns about property values, fears about racial outsiders, and [fear] of crime.\u201d\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority learned their concessions hadn\u2019t bought peace in late March of 1971, when a group of 30 women, some towing children, entered the construction site and sat down to obstruct the bulldozers. These direct action protests began occurring every day, accompanied by near constant picketing. Many Whitman Park residents had unionized jobs as stevedores at the nearby Navy Yard or in the building trades, so the protesters appealed to class solidarity with the unionized construction workers.\nPicket signs read, \u201cWill organized labor encourage socialism or defend democracy?\u201d and \u201cHonor Our Pickets, You Pay Taxe$ Also, No Public Housing.\u201d When construction equipment or delivery trucks approached the site, a warning system was established to rally nearby residents who happened to be home, usually women and children, who would rush out to block access to the site. Sound trucks would roll through the neighborhood to call people to the picket lines or to community meetings. Although the Whitman Council and its president, Fred Druding, eschewed racist language or appeals to violence, ominous rumblings were heard at many public meetings.\n\u201cIf public housing is built, we will blow it up,\u201d a neighborhood resident said at a mass meeting, according to a police report. Another cop heard, \u201cWe don\u2019t want no n****** in our neighborhood.\u201d Vandalism continued. The contractor, Multicon, sought an injunction against the sit-ins and constant picketing. But the protests only grew in size and fury and Democratic Mayor Jim Tate, already worried about working-class whites defecting to Nixon\u2019s Republican Party, temporarily ceased construction.\n\u201cThe potential for violence to erupt in the Whitman Park area in South Philadelphia if construction resumes on the low-income housing being developed in that area is an almost certain fact,\u201d wrote police commissioner Joseph O\u2019Neill on June 7, estimating that a detachment of 800 police officers would be needed in the event of a riot. Instead former police commissioner Frank Rizzo got to be the next mayor, Multicon got $3.5 million in damages when he killed the project, and the city got hit with a landmark civil rights lawsuit.\nTo the Courts!\nThe city\u2019s leading Democrats ran Rizzo because they feared losing the white row house vote, which had been breaking for Republican candidates. The former police commissioner could win them back with his tough guy tactics (he told one newspaper during the election that the Black Panthers \u201cshould be strung up. I mean, legally\u201d).\nThroughout his campaign, Rizzo promised to shut down the Whitman project if elected, and to never allow public housing in any neighborhood that didn\u2019t want it. When Multicon tried to resume construction in 1972, he took them to court. When the Philadelphia-area HUD director tried to intervene, Rizzo got in touch with the Nixon White House and the HUD director got a call from the D.C. agency\u2019s general counsel with orders to keep a \u201clow profile.\u201d With no help forthcoming from the feds, Multicon left the project with $3.5 million (inflation-adjusted) in city money as consolation.\nA nascent civil legal aid organization, Community Legal Services, decided to go after Rizzo and the city over the disparate impact Whitman Park\u2019s cancellation would have on Philadelphia\u2019s African-American population. Young lawyers George Gould and Jonathan Stein represented the Resident Advisory Board (RAB), a scrappy public housing tenant organization that quickly began protest actions of its own when the Whitman residents began obstructing the construction of Whitman Park. The long trial brought the interference of Nixon\u2019s HUD to light. It also included testimony from the former head of the housing authority, who swore that Rizzo told him that the tenants of public housing were almost all Black and that white neighborhoods shouldn\u2019t be forced to accept such developments against their will. Tensions ran high.\n\u201cI was there every day, and they [the Whitman residents] were terrible acting in court,\u201d remembers Nellie Reynolds, a leader in RAB and resident of the Johnson Homes in North Philadelphia. \u201cThere was a mob of them waiting out there for me. They would stand by the elevator waiting for me to get off and they would call me all kinds of names. I would act like I didn\u2019t hear it. The reporters were always asking me why I didn\u2019t cuss them back, and I would say \u2018Because I\u2019m going to be their next-door neighbor. You think I\u2019m going to fight with my neighbors?\u2019\u201d\nGould and Stein tried to prove that Rizzo\u2019s actions were motivated by an animus toward Black people and that his policies would disproportionately harm them. And with an almost entirely Black waiting list in one of the most segregated cities in the nation, their case was strong. But the 1968 Fair Housing Act\u2019s disparate impact standard was as yet untested before a circuit court, and the judge presiding over the case, Raymond Broderick, was a Nixon appointee as well as the 1970 Republican candidate for governor of Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, in 1976, Broderick ruled in favor of RAB, found that Rizzo and the city had acted with discriminatory intent, and in the process established judicial acceptance of the Fair Housing Law\u2019s disparate impact test. When the Supreme Court upheld the disparate impact standard in a 5-4 vote last summer, they cited RAB v. Rizzo.\n\u201cThe evidence is uncontradicted that Mayor Rizzo, both before and after taking office in January of 1972, considered public housing to be Black housing and took a stand against placing such housing in White neighborhoods,\u201d the decision reads. \u201cFurther, the City must be charged with knowledge of the fact that \u2026 the cancellation of the Whitman Park Townhouse Project had an obvious disparate effect on the Black community. \u2026 We also find that the evidence in this record establishes that the City of Philadelphia acted with racially discriminatory purpose in halting the Whitman Park Townhouse Project, and in canceling the contracts with Multicon.\u201d\nThe Rizzo administration tried to delay the inevitable with a series of appeals, but it had no hope of victory. Tensions in the neighborhood burned still higher. One of the few Black residents of Whitman, a Vietnam veteran, told the Philadelphia Daily News that mysterious attackers had begun throwing bricks and beer bottles through his windows and vandalizing his car. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve lived in cities all over the world, including some southern towns,\u201d he told the reporter, emphasizing that he opposed the public housing too. \u201cBut I never had any problems like this until I came back home.\u201d\nThe Pro-Housing Movement\nThis time, however, there was a mass protest movement to counter the influence of the anti-housing activists. The mostly female membership of RAB had been fighting for Whitman Park since 1971, but by the late 1970s the city\u2019s ascendant Black political class took up the cause. The women and, later, their lawyers made the wise tactical choice to make the fight about Rizzo, instead of just abstract issues like segregation and public housing.\n\u201cRizzo was such an unpopular figure in the African-American community, it made sense to tie their movement to restart construction on Whitman Park to him,\u201d says Timothy Lombardo, author of the only scholarly treatment of the Whitman controversy and of the forthcoming The Rise of Blue-Collar Conservatism: Frank Rizzo\u2019s Philadelphia and the Politics of the Urban Crisis. \u201cRather than attack the community that had worked to stop construction, they could attack Rizzo, who already had a reputation as a racist and a bully.\u201d\nFigures from across the spectrum joined the chorus in favor of Whitman Park, from Charles Bowser, who had served in the previous mayoral administration, to the fiery Milton Street, who led marches to the site and threatened to camp out on the vacant lot until it was built. In early April 1978, he led a column of 2,000 mostly African-American protesters to the vacant lot in an aggressive demonstration of support.\nWith Nixon gone and Carter in the White House, HUD moved to shut off the funding spigots if Philadelphia didn\u2019t restart construction. The city would eventually lose tens of millions in HUD money as punishment. By 1978, when the Supreme Court refused to even hear the appeal of RAB v. Rizzo, the obstinate mayor and his most loyal constituents had their backs against the wall.\n\u201cThe people who have been calling you racist, they want to rub your nose in it, make you back up,\u201d Rizzo told a mass of cheering supporters on March 15, 1978, in the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel School, a few blocks from the construction site. \u201cWhen Blacks say something, it\u2019s to help their people. When the whites get together and ask for something, they\u2019re racist. Where\u2019s the fairness here?\u201d\nWithin a year and a half, Rizzo would be out of power. Deprived of political support or legal alternative, the Whitman Council held a vote on the next course of action: 803 voted to secede from the city and 5,138 to \u201creturn to the streets.\u201d Only 52 voted to accept federal court orders.\nAgain they appealed for solidarity from construction workers and truck drivers, some of whom refused to deliver goods to the site. When that didn\u2019t work, they tried insults and threats. Black workers told the Philadelphia Bulletin they had been called \u201cn*****s\u201d and \u201cBlack motherfuckers\u201d on their way to work. White workers described being spat upon and called \u201cwhite n*****s.\u201d Their names and addresses were read over loudspeakers.\nHundreds of protesters ringed the site and dozens sat in at the entrance. This time the cops weren\u2019t so lenient. On June 3, 1980, 63 people were arrested at the site. Then on June 6, Whitman exploded.\nThat night a 70-year-old anti-housing demonstrator, Marian Carr, was shot in the temple and died while soliciting funds to cover legal fees for neighborhood residents arrested during the actions. Her killer, Ralph D\u2019Amico, had fired five shots from his second story window after an altercation with another group of legal fundraisers (one of whom apparently tossed a brick through his window). A riot ensued. Six hundred enraged residents stormed into the streets, and fires were set near the construction site. This time the police did leave their vehicles, and were met with showers of rocks and glass bottles. Again the mob targeted the protective fence, partially tearing it down.\n\u201cI remember a lot of the people in the neighborhood had to report to their probation officers for a long time after that,\u201d says Mayor Jim Kenney, who took office in January 2016 and grew up just to the north of Whitman. \u201cIt was very ugly. A lot of it was unnecessary and inappropriate. But the ways in which the housing was designed and the tenants selected, a lot of that was because of the protests. More moderate-income people moved in.\u201d\nAftermath\nWhitman Park opened in October 1982. It seems there were few, if any, incidents to mar the move in. After 25 years of strife, Whitman Park basically just faded into the neighborhood.\n\u201cI was on the board of the housing authority for 25 years and never heard about it again,\u201d says Reynolds, who served in that capacity as a representative of RAB. \u201cIt\u2019s the strangest thing. For 25 years the only time I heard Whitman Park mentioned was when I mentioned it myself.\u201d\nPerhaps that\u2019s in part because Whitman Park wasn\u2019t public housing in the traditional sense. Even before the storm of violent protests, the Philadelphia Housing Authority had already dramatically restructured its vision for the Whitman Homes from permanently affordable rental housing to a low-income homeownership scheme. In 1980, Judge Broderick had ordered that the tenants be 50 percent white and 50 percent Black. (The Whitman Council took no position on this quota publicly, with Druding saying race \u201chas never been an issue with us. The issue is the fact that we think the project is a rip-off of the American taxpayer.\u201d)\nMeanwhile, Ronald Reagan\u2019s HUD raised the income requirements for the project. Incoming residents had to make between $30,705 and $67,611 in today\u2019s dollars, and not be receiving welfare. The median family income in 1980 in the Census tract containing Whitman was $42,167. According to Lombardo, all of the initial renters were on the lower end of HUD\u2019s scale, in the $30,000 to $35,000 range. Those tenants who completed the lease-purchase period and met the Turnkey III stipulations were able to purchase the homes, and then sell them at market value if they wished. Eventually, all the units were purchased. Today, the neighborhood again contains no public housing.\n\u201cBy 2009, they were all privately owned,\u201d says Councilman Squilla. \u201cBut as a community organizer [before that], I never had an issue with either race relations there or crime. Nothing to make you say \u2018Oh that\u2019s the Whitman homes.\u2019 It was just part of Whitman.\u201d\nToday many of the people on the stoops and in the driveways of those long-contested row houses are Asian, testament to the influx of Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrants into South Philadelphia. The arrival of young middle-class newcomers and upmarket restaurants that has transformed South Philadelphia neighborhoods closer to Center City has not yet reached Whitman, which isn\u2019t within comfortable walking distance of downtown. There is a larger African-American population now, although the immediately surrounding blocks still appear very white. The larger census tract has gone from 96 percent white in 1970 to 78.6 percent white today; the Black population is 7.2 percent and the Asian population 11.9 percent.\n\u201cThings have drastically changed,\u201d says Elijah Mason, who is African American and sits on the board of the Whitman Council. His children went to Mt. Carmel, the now-shuttered neighborhood Catholic elementary school where Rizzo gave his impassioned speech about \u201cethnic rights\u201d in 1978. \u201cIt\u2019s a diverse area now. I\u2019ve never had any problems. A lot of people during that time thought they were going to be bringing in undesirables to the community. That\u2019s why people was protesting. That changed over time because they see that the people in this development, they keeping up with their property, they doing everything they can to maintain our property value.\u201d\nEconomically, the neighborhood has remained remarkably stable, in contrast to most of Philadelphia\u2019s row-home neighborhoods, avoiding dramatic movement up or down market. It is by no means an expensive neighborhood, but Whitman is still unaffordable to those served by traditional public housing. According to Red Fin, the median sales price for a \u201ctownhouse\u201d was $121,000 in 2009, and after five years of decline, jumped to $136,500 in 2015. Today the Whitman Council fights to preserve the single-family nature of its housing, holding the line against outside investors and duplexes.\nAfter Whitman Park was built, Philadelphia and its Pennsylvania-side suburbs abandoned integration as a policy goal. Instead, policymakers concentrate on getting affordable housing into low-income neighborhoods where it would more likely be appreciated, or at least not so vehemently opposed. Whitman was the last development to be built in the city under the traditional public housing program. During the 1990s, the few high-rise public housing complexes close to the revitalized Center City were demolished under the HOPE VI program. Newer affordable housing programs have resulted in familiar patterns of segregation. During President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, an attempt was made by the region\u2019s housing authorities to enable Section 8 voucher holders from Philadelphia to locate in more affluent suburban areas, and their substantially better funded school districts, but the effort collapsed amid bureaucratic infighting and all the voucher holders either ended up back in the city or in struggling inner-ring suburbs.\nThe lesson of this forgotten battle over public housing in South Philadelphia is that politicians and bureaucracies alone cannot overcome the reactionary resistance of homeowners who learn that lower-income people, often of a different race, may soon be moving in next door. Policymakers cannot be expected to act as crusading superheroes. Without countervailing interest groups to get bodies in the street, voters in the booths, and lawyers in the courtroom, segregation will remain in place.\nComments"

      "text": "In August 2025, the city of Philadelphia agreed to return a statue of Frank Rizzo to the supporters that commissioned the memorial in 1992.\nThe 2,000-pound bronze tribute to the former police commissioner-turned-mayor had stood in front of the city\u2019s Municipal Services Building from 1998 until 2020, when then-mayor Jim Kenney ordered it removed days after protesters attempted to topple it during the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd.\nWhile the agreement states that the statue cannot be placed in public view, conservatives have still hailed its return as a triumph for Rizzo\u2019s legacy. In the ongoing culture wars over historical memory and memorialization, Rizzo\u2019s supporters have declared their repossession of the statue a victory over the \u201cwoke mayor\u201d who unlawfully removed it.\nAs a historian and native Philadelphian, I have written extensively about the city. My first book, which will be rereleased with a new preface in February 2026, traces the rise of Rizzo\u2019s political appeal and contextualizes his supporters\u2019 politics in the broader history of the rise of the right.\nMy work recognizes Rizzo not only as the quintessential backlash politician of the 1960s and 1970s, but also as a harbinger of today\u2019s identity-based populism that favors social and cultural victories over economic redistribution.\nAs police commissioner from 1967 to 1971 and mayor from 1972 to 1979, Rizzo became a hero to the white, blue-collar Philadelphians who clamored for \u201claw and order\u201d and railed against liberal policymaking. Until he died in 1991, while running a third campaign to retake the mayor\u2019s office, Rizzo was an avatar of what I call \u201cblue-collar conservatism.\u201d\nUnderstanding Rizzo\u2019s career and political popularity can help explain the persistent appeal of this identity-based populism in the 21st century.\nRizzo, from cop to mayor\nFrancis Lazzaro Rizzo was born in South Philadelphia, in the mostly Italian-American neighborhood his parents settled in after immigrating from Calabria, Italy.\nIn a city where police work was often a family affair, Rizzo followed his father\u2019s footsteps into the Philadelphia Police Department a few years after dropping out of high school.\nEarly on, he drew praise from superiors for his clean-cut image and aggressive policing. In the 1950s, Rizzo fortified that reputation while patrolling predominantly Black neighborhoods in West Philadelphia and leading raids on gay meeting places in Center City.\nAs deputy commissioner in the 1960s, Rizzo directly confronted the city\u2019s civil rights movement. Among other exploits, he commanded the response to the Columbia Avenue Uprising in 1964, when North Philadelphia residents responded to an all-too-common act of police brutality with three days of urban disorder.\nHe also faced down protesters seeking to integrate Girard College, an all-white city-operated boarding school for orphaned boys in the heart of predominantly Black North Philadelphia.\nWhile serving as acting commissioner in 1967, Rizzo led a throng of baton-wielding police into a crowd of high schoolers demanding education reform. The scene ended with police chasing down and beating mostly Black youngsters in front of the Board of Education headquarters.\nRizzo was promoted to commissioner later that year.\nWhile African Americans and white liberals decried his \u201cGestapo tactics,\u201d Rizzo grew increasingly popular among the city\u2019s white, blue-collar residents.\nHe capitalized on their enthusiasm in 1971, when he campaigned and won his first election for mayor as both a Democrat and the self-proclaimed \u201ctoughest cop in America.\u201d\nFor two terms he rewarded his supporters by opposing and limiting liberal programs they had fought, like public housing, school desegregation and affirmative action. When dissatisfied Democrats challenged his reelection in 1975, Rizzo vowed revenge by saying he would \u201cmake Atilla the Hun look like a fa\u2014t.\u201d\nFinally, while campaigning for an amendment to Philadelphia\u2019s Home Rule Charter to allow him to run for a third consecutive mayoral term, Rizzo told an all-white audience of public housing opponents to \u201cvote white\u201d for charter change.\nPopulism then and now\nRizzo\u2019s record makes clear why protesters targeted his statue in 2020. When Mayor Kenney ordered it removed, he called it \u201ca deplorable monument to racism, bigotry and police brutality for members of the Black community, the LGBTQ community and many others.\u201d\nWhile Rizzo and his supporters were certainly part of the late 1960s backlash against civil rights and liberalism generally, his populism was more complex and durable than that narrative suggests.\nHe also offered affirmation to a beleaguered white, blue-collar identity. His supporters raved about his forceful policing and cheered his anti-liberalism as a last line of defense against policies they considered threats to their livelihoods. Just as important, they saw themselves reflected in the rough-talking high school dropout who worked his way up to the most powerful position in Philadelphia.\nWhen Rizzo first ran for mayor, one of his supporters told a reporter that \u201cHe\u2019ll win because he isn\u2019t a Ph.D. He\u2019s one of us. Rizzo came up the hard way.\u201d\nThat kind of identity-based populism offered social and cultural victories even when it did little to address the declining economy that struck urban America in the 1970s. So while Rizzo\u2019s populism had few answers for deindustrialization, in 1972 he was able to temporarily halt construction on a public housing project in an all-white section of his native South Philadelphia.\nTrump\u2019s similar appeal\nDonald Trump offers a similar populist appeal in the 21st century. In fact, he has drawn comparisons to Rizzo since his first presidential campaign.\nLike Rizzo, Trump\u2019s appeal is more social and cultural than economic. Critics have argued that Trump\u2019s promotion of traditional Republican economic policies belie the notion that he is a populist. Trump\u2019s populism, however, lies not in his ability to deliver working-class prosperity, but conservative victories in the nation\u2019s long-standing culture wars.\nTrump\u2019s policies may not fulfill his promise to lower the cost of groceries or health care, but mass deportations reward those who fear a changing American identity.\nSending troops into cities may not address the cost-of-living crisis, but it delights those who see disorder in urban society.\nTrump\u2019s attempt to recast national history museums in a patriotic mold may not usher in a new \u201cGolden Age of America,\u201d but it promises a victory to opponents of \u201cwoke\u201d history.\nRedistributive vs. identity populism\nDespite the lopsided attention Trump\u2019s social and cultural populism receives, a kind of progressive, redistributive populism persists in many American cities. This populism promises a redirection of resources from elites and toward working people.\nIn Philadelphia in 2023, the multicultural, left-populist Working Families Party won the two at-large seats reserved for minority-party representation in the city\u2019s legislature. Currently, Zohran Mamdani\u2019s upstart campaign for mayor of New York seems to be reviving a long tradition of progressive urban populism.\nRedistributive populism, however, remains at odds with the identity populism once championed by Rizzo and now by Trump. While the Trump administration\u2019s policies may promise social and cultural victories, they have done little to affect the economic prospects of working-class Americans.\nRead more of our stories about Philadelphia."

      "text": "August 10, 2016\nIt was a casual conversation in their Montgomery County kitchen, but when Joanna and Joe Mastronardo got to talking about politics \u2013 specifically, Donald Trump \u2013 the repartee was akin to the back-and-forth of a cable-news roundtable.\nYou see, Joanna is the daughter of late Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, which makes Joe a grandson of the larger-than-controversial-life figure.\nWe met to discuss how Rizzo\u2019s name has re-entered the public conversation due to the similarities some see in a certain Republican nominee for president. Our Tuesday morning chat weaved its way through Philadelphia history and national politics of the day.\nJoe is firmly \u2013 and vehemently \u2013 in the Trump camp, while his mother remains undecided.\nThough she most assuredly won\u2019t be voting for Hillary Clinton, she harbors concerns about the Republican\u2019s disposition, and doesn\u2019t take kindly to people who say her father would act like Trump if he were around today.\nHere are the highlights of the 90-minute discussion, on the day word arose of what Joe termed a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d push to remove the statue of Rizzo from Center City .\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJoanna: I don\u2019t think my father would ever be as out-of-control with his temperament and as unprepared that way [as Trump], ever.\nJoe: Mom, don\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t agree with that at all. Out of control?\n\"My grandfather would be exactly like Donald Trump. ... He wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his mouth shut. He couldn\u2019t keep his opinions to himself.\" \u2013 Joe Mastronardo, grandson of Frank Rizzo\nJoanna: I might not vote for Trump. I think Trump\u2019s temperament and his apparent lack of preparedness is showing.\nJoe: My mom\u2019s brainwashed by CNN.\nPhillyVoice: Well, she could turn right around and say you\u2019re brainwashed by FoxNews.\nJoe: I watch both. When I watch CNN, it just angers me. I guess it\u2019s the TV business, playing to their audience, saying what the audience wants to hear, but the black vs. white racism that\u2019s put forth on CNN is really disturbing.\nPhillyVoice asked Joanna what she thought her father would think of the Trump campaign and the country he is playing to.\nJoanna: The Sixties were such a different time, and it seems like it\u2019s heading back that way now. I think he wouldn\u2019t react today the way he did back then, I\u2019m sure.\nI do know that he wouldn\u2019t tolerate disrespect for the police. He may not react the same way, but again, he\u2019d think it out. That\u2019s the one thing about him, no matter what anyone says. How he said \u2018I\u2019m older and wiser now,\u2019 and how he grew. He actually grew. That\u2019s what life\u2019s about, so for anybody to hold actions that were performed, done when he was a policeman, at a time when violence was really increasing in many places, what else could he do? He was a product of his times, too. When he said he grew, I always admired him for that statement, because I knew how deeply he meant it. He was older and wiser.\n\"I disagree with that. He bit his tongue more than anybody I\u2019ve ever known. Please.\" \u2013 Joanna Mastronardo, Frank Rizzo's daughter\nJoe: When I was a kid, when I was growing up, I spent a ton of time with my grandfather. He didn\u2019t treat me like a kid. He treated me like a teenager when I was 8, 9. So I was older than my years. We would go out every weekend, the Shore, car rides, malls, I spent so much time with him that I really knew who he was. I wasn\u2019t just a kid, I was nine when he died, but I spent a ton of time with him. We talked at length about a lot of things, so when I tell you that I know what he would\u2019ve said, or I know what he would\u2019ve done, he said things to me that he didn\u2019t say to other people. He told me the truth about a lot of things, when he was going to run, what really happened with a lot of different things.\nHe\u2019d be a lot like Trump. Maybe slightly [more reined in than Trump] because he was more of a polished politician. He was a politician, Trump\u2019s not a politician, but I think he\u2019d be a lot like Trump today. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take this political correctness at all. I think he\u2019d go against the grain a lot. He\u2019d do a lot of things, and say a lot of things, that Trump has done. He wouldn\u2019t take the way things are going. At all.\nJoanna: He was a product of his times in many ways, but, because he was as smart as he was, he grew, and that\u2019s what life\u2019s about. Growing. Learning from experience. Listening to negative things that are said about you and ingesting them. That\u2019s what he did. He was quite a different man when he died compared to when he just got started [in politics].\nJoe: He also knew that, in order to get elected when he wanted to run for mayor again, that he knew he needed to get the black vote. You have to do certain things, you have to evolve, or else you\u2019re going to be left off to the side. You\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\nPhillyVoice: What do you make of people saying that the statue should be taken down?\nJoanna: I think that\u2019s ridiculous.\nJoe: That\u2019s all that Black Lives Matter/Obama nonsense.\nPhillyVoice asked what it\u2019s like to hear the Rizzo name brought back up often in connection with the current election season.\nJoe: He\u2019s brought up a lot. When the pope was here. Articles about Trump getting \u2018the Rizzo vote,\u2019 people who don\u2019t say who they\u2019re going to vote for and then on Election Day, they come out and vote for Frank Rizzo. Somebody wrote to me on Twitter the other day that \u2018your grandfather has been reduced to a laughingstock\u2019 or something like that. I said yeah, that\u2019s why he\u2019s written about every week, because he\u2019s a laughingstock. They were trying to get a rise out of me, I guess.\nPhillyVoice: Have you always liked Trump?\nJoe: I never watched \"The Apprentice.\" I knew who he was. I\u2019m a big wrestling fan and he did some things with the WWE; I think he got \u2018you\u2019re fired\u2019 from Vince McMahon, I don\u2019t know that for a fact. Once he started running for president and I started watching him, he really won me over. I really liked his message from the beginning. I saw that there was something special there; he had a charisma, you could see right away that he was going to be against the grain, he wasn\u2019t going to be scripted, he\u2019d say what he wanted to say. I remember thinking, right at the beginning, that this is going to gain steam and he\u2019s going to end up winning.\nJoanna: He\u2019s given a voice to the silent majority.\nJoe: What it is is courage. He\u2019s got a lot of guts.\nJoanna: The down-and-out, the tired, they\u2019re identifying with him. It shows you how many people are discontented. Trump got the message out there that all the people are trying to deliver.\nPhillyVoice asked about similarities between the Trump and Rizzo political eras.\nJoanna: I don\u2019t think so. I think he was just part of a big-city political structure, a middle-class, lower-middle class population for the most part. A lot of big cities were like this. Race wasn\u2019t the only issue. There were other things. Businesses were starting to leave the city. Unions were very powerful. It was a whole atmosphere; it wasn\u2019t just race, but it was complicated by the race issues. It was the times.\nI haven\u2019t decided [who I\u2019ll vote for yet].\nJoe: That\u2019s my mom being brainwashed by CNN. You going to vote for Hillary Clinton, one of the worse human beings I\u2019ve ever seen? The country would somehow get worse if she gets elected.\nJoanna: I\u2019m not voting for her. Both candidates have the highest negative ratings of any person who ever ran before.\nJoe: Trump\u2019s negatives are driven by college kids who have no clue what the hell they\u2019re talking about, never read an article, never watched TV, basing their opinions on some Facebook memes because they\u2019re too lazy to do anything other than that and they just want handouts. The only people I\u2019ve met who like Hillary Clinton are 21-year-old kids who don\u2019t know s---. They always say 'No' if I ask them whether they really know about the issues....\nMy grandfather would be exactly like Donald Trump because things have just progressed, progressed, progressed to this point. He wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his mouth shut. He couldn\u2019t keep his opinions to himself.\nJoanna: I disagree with that. He bit his tongue more than anybody I\u2019ve ever known. Please.\nJoe: You think with all these police officers getting killed in Philadelphia over the past 10 years, because there\u2019s no respect for the law whatsoever \u2026 [Fewer] police officers would have died if my grandfather was still alive because he wouldn\u2019t have just taken it.\nJoanna: I\u2019ll agree with that, but we\u2019re talking about the similarities that can be drawn between the two.\nJoe: I\u2019m willing to forgive a few mistakes that I think he\u2019s made for [his penchant for speaking instantaneously]. I love the guy. Do I think there were a couple unnecessary battles? Yeah, absolutely. I trust him enough that it shows a \u2018no-fear\u2019 [mentality].\n\"I go by the philosophy in life that you treat others like they treat you, with the respect that you expect in return.\" \u2013 Joanna Mastronardo\nJoanna: When the Kennedys were introducing John onto the scene when he wanted to run for president, I read this somewhere when I was back in school, his brother Bobby went to him \u2013 they lived in Massachusetts, and there weren\u2019t many African-Americans there \u2013 and said, Look, this race issue is starting to take over the country and you have to attach yourself to it if you want to become president. Other than that, they had nothing to do with African-Americans before. On a one-to-one basis, they were not attached to the African-American community. History\u2019s a funny thing. People attach themselves to issues. It\u2019s the way it is, especially when you\u2019re in politics. These issues that Trump\u2019s attached himself to, he has a pulse on people. For all his weaknesses, he has a lot of savvy.\nJoe: [Trump] walked into a fixed system, with everyone against him, and he won. He beat the system. Beat the system.\nJoanna: It was timing. He\u2019d probably been keeping a list for 10 years. His temperament, I can almost deal with, but it\u2019s the lack of preparedness that gets to me, not knowing Russia was already in the Ukraine. It blows my mind. I can\u2019t imagine. These people that he\u2019s paying to advise him? What the heck?\nI remember we would say something to my father \u2013 my brother, me, my mother \u2013 he would listen. He wouldn\u2019t go out and act like that. I think, sometimes, he\u2019s incorrigible.\nJoe: That\u2019s a good thing. That means he won\u2019t back down.\nJoanna: Well, you know, sometimes you have to back down.\nJoe: That\u2019s a good thing, being incorrigible. That\u2019s what we need.\nJoanna: Oh God.\nJoe: People have no guts in this country. [Clint] Eastwood was right: The country\u2019s soft.\nJoanna: The last two weeks have really hurt Trump. A lot of people I talk to say he can\u2019t come back from it. I don\u2019t believe that. I think he can. It\u2019s really a shame. You pick your talking points when you\u2019re running for something, and he shot himself in the foot.\nI just can\u2019t believe the temperament issue, but I think Trump tapped into everything that is affecting Americans who are not in the upper five percent.\nWhen I was a kid, in my teens, you were exposed to the news through your newspaper in the morning and evening. Now it\u2019s constant. If a truck turns over in Minnesota, you know it.\nJoe: They make stories out of nothing. The liberal media\u2019s out of control.\nJoanna: ...In the days my father was mayor, as strong-willed as my father could be, when [confidant and attorney] Marty Weinberg, or [managing director] Hillel Levinson, or any of those guys would say something, he always listened, and he'd never, ever disregard what they said.\nGoing to school \u2013 high school and college \u2013 at a time when he was actually running for mayor, [candidate] Bill Green came to Chestnut Hill [College]. He got up there and gave a nasty speech to the student body. I got up and walked out. It was hard. I just can\u2019t imagine how they let [Trump] go on like this.\nJoe: I think Barack Obama is the worst thing to ever happen to the United States of America. I think he\u2019s the worst human being.\nPhillyVoice: Oh, he\u2019s not the worst human being.\nJoe: I think he\u2019s the ultimate divider.\nJoanna: Stop acting like you know who. Trump.\nI go by the philosophy in life that you treat others like they treat you, with the respect that you expect in return. The problem is that when you use the vernacular that Trump uses, it\u2019s hard to execute it in the real world. You know what I mean?\nJoe: My grandfather was very similar to Donald Trump. Let\u2019s just cut the bull.\nJoanna: He attached himself to issues that were relevant at the time.\nJoe: He wouldn\u2019t take any of this nonsense that\u2019s going on. The way they try to shove the politically-correct stuff down your throat nowadays, he would not be able to keep his mouth shut at all. No way, shape or form. My grandfather would almost be exactly like Donald Trump. He\u2019d be little more polished, smart and controlled about it. Otherwise, he would not sit there and just read from a script.\nPhillyVoice: I don\u2019t think he was ever considered unhinged, though.\nJoanna: And that\u2019s what bothers me [about Trump]. Temperament and a lack of preparedness.\nJoe: I agree with that.\nJoanna: The only time I ever saw him lose his composure was when he was walking the dog \u2026\nPhillyVoice: The \u2018crumb bum\u201d thing?!\nJoe: People send me that video almost once a day.\nJoanna: I hear there\u2019s a radio show that uses that all the time. That was the first and last time I\u2019ve ever seen him lose his composure. I was in the kitchen. He came in, and he was white. I could tell something was wrong. \u2018What happened?\u2019 And he said that guy, I\u2019m walking the dog, minding my own business, and he stuck a camera in my face, almost knocked my nose off my face.\nJoe: What they did to [my grandfather] all those years, they tried to paint him as a racist.\nJoanna: That was their revenge. That\u2019s how they got back at him.\nPhillyVoice: It would be that kind of scene, the crumb-bum confrontation, all the time with the way the media landscape is today.\nJoe: Absolutely. But my grandfather would be a little bit more polished\u2026\nJoanna: Not a little bit. A lot more polished. He was too proud to act like [Trump]. \u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to talk today, but you really got me going.\nPhillyVoice: Happy you did!\nJoe: My mom\u2019s absolutely voting for Donald Trump. I won\u2019t have it any other way.\nJoanna: You can\u2019t come in the booth with me.\nAfter the interview ended, PhillyVoice called Rizzo's son, the former Republican city councilman, to see where he stood on the Trump-Rizzo comparison.\nFrannie Rizzo: My dad was an outspoken guy, but I don't remember him insulting people. Well, the only time he'd insult someone was a criminal.\nNow, I'm a big Trump supporter. I have pictures in my house down the Shore of us together. The last couple of weeks have been pivotal for him. People are having second thoughts about voting for him, and the polls reflect that. I'd think as a businessman, he'd see that insulting people doesn't work if you want to be successful.\nMy dad was a police officer in the '50s, '60s, '70s, and he knew that if you were polite, people would react in a polite way. I can't remember him ever being hurtful. He was a tough guy, but he was fair."

  "argos_summary": "Frank Rizzo, a former Philadelphia police commissioner and mayor known for his hard\u2011line law\u2011and\u2011order stance, became a symbol of blue\u2011collar conservatism that echoes in Donald Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric. His 1998 bronze statue was removed in 2020 amid protests following George Floyd\u2019s murder, sparking debate over historical memory and racial justice. The article traces Rizzo\u2019s influence on white, working\u2011class politics, contrasts it with Trump\u2019s modern campaign, and examines how both figures mobilized cultural and economic anxieties to shape American political discourse.",
