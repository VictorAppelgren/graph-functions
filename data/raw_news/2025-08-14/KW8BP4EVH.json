The former Alabama and Texas wide receiver was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in a sexual assault case.\n\nA Collin County grand jury in Texas returned a \"no bill,\" which ends the possibility of an indictment.\n\n\"After reviewing all the evidence presented, a Collin County grand jury returned a 'no bill' in the sexual assault charge involving Isaiah Bond, meaning no indictment will be issued,\" Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said in a statement obtained by CBS News Texas. \"This concludes the criminal proceedings in this matter.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 21-year-old Bond revealed his plans to join the Cleveland Browns for his rookie season. A contract with the Browns has yet to be finalized, ESPN reported. But Bond said he was thankful for the organization's belief in him.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"First and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Cleveland Browns for believing in me and allowing me the opportunity to continue my career in the NFL,\" Bond said in a statement. \"Football has been my passion since I was six years old, and playing at this level is a blessing I will never take for granted.

He did, however, reaffirm his innocence.\n\n\"I know there have been questions and reports about the recent allegations. I am grateful for the decision of the prosecutor and the courts not to pursue charges. I will learn from this experience as I grow in wisdom, character, and faith. On the advice of my attorney, I will not discuss the details of this case, but I want to be clear: from the very beginning I have refuted these allegations and maintained my innocence. I stand firm by that today.\"\n\nBond turned himself in to police in Texas April 10, just two weeks before the 2025 NFL Draft. He was released from custody after posting $25,000 bond. Bond went undrafted.\n\nBond's attorneys filed a lawsuit against the unnamed accuser, and the suit was ultimately dismissed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBond's college football career started in Tuscaloosa with the Alabama Crimson Tide.
