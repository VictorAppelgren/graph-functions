      "summary": "Stocks rose as markets priced in a higher probability of a Fed rate cut, driven by falling 10‑year Treasury yields and weaker labor market data. The Fed Beige Book signaled stagflation and flat consumer spending, while July factory orders and JOLTS openings fell, boosting cut expectations. Energy stocks were pressured by a 2% drop in WTI crude, but megacap tech names like Alphabet and Apple gained on favorable court rulings. Fed officials reiterated that rates are above neutral and that cuts are likely in September, with a 95% probability in futures markets. Tariff uncertainty and a court ruling on Trump’s tariffs added a bearish backdrop for the broader market.",
