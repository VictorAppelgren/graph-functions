  "title": "Nick Scali (ASX:NCK) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of A$0.33",
  "description": "The board of Nick Scali Limited ( ASX:NCK ) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 28th of October, with...",
  "content": "The board of Nick Scali Limited (ASX:NCK) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 28th of October, with investors receiving A$0.33 per share. This payment means the dividend yield will be 3.0%, which is below the average for the industry.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nNick Scali's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before this announcement, Nick Scali was paying out 93% of earnings, but a comparatively small 53% of free cash flows. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 77.1% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 59% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Nick Scali\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was A$0.14 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was A$0.63. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 16% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.\n\nWe Could See Nick Scali's Dividend Growing\n\nInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Nick Scali has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 5.4% per annum. Past earnings growth has been decent, but unless this is one of those rare businesses that can grow without additional capital investment or marketing spend, we'd generally expect the higher payout ratio to limit its future growth prospects.\n\nOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We don't think Nick Scali is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Nick Scali that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

  "argos_summary": "Nick Scali Limited has announced a dividend payment of A$0.33 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 3.0%, which is below the industry average. The company's earnings are projected to rise significantly, and its dividend payments appear sustainable, with a payout ratio expected to be around 59%. Despite a stable dividend history and decent past earnings growth, analysts suggest that Nick Scali may not be an ideal choice for income-focused investors due to its high payout ratio and potential growth limitations.",
