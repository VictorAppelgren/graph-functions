  "title": "Global Bond Selloff Deepens With Longer Debt Leading Losses",
  "description": "Yields on Japan\u2019s 20-year notes climbed to the highest since 1999 on Wednesday, while Australian 10-year bond yields rose to levels last seen in July.  Treasury yields also advanced, with those on benchmark 30-year debt approaching to within a whisker of the closely watched 5% level.  Taken together, the selloff reflects traders\u2019 concerns around heavy government spending and the potential inflationary fallout worldwide.",
  "content": "Global bonds are facing renewed selling pressure as jitters around inflation, debt sales and fiscal discipline erode sentiment toward what had previously been some of the world\u2019s safest assets.\n\nYields on Japan\u2019s 20-year notes climbed to the highest since 1999 on Wednesday, while Australian 10-year bond yields rose to levels last seen in July. Treasury yields also advanced, with those on benchmark 30-year debt approaching to within a whisker of the closely watched 5% level.\n\u2022 One of World\u2019s Most Liveable Cities Ends Euro-a-Day Travel Pass\n\u2022 Sydney\u2019s New Airport Will Take Travelers Into the Wild\n\u2022 In New Orleans, Katrina Taught a Lesson in Local Resilience\n\nThe losses in Asia came after UK 30-year yields jumped on Tuesday to the highest levels since 1998. Taken together, the selloff reflects traders\u2019 concerns around heavy government spending and the potential inflationary fallout worldwide. A deluge of corporate sales on Tuesday and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence are adding to the pressures.\n\n\u201cDeficit and debt issues cannot be easily or quickly addressed,\u201d said Andrew Ticehurst, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Sydney. \u201cSteeper curves are the new normal.\u201d\n\nA Bloomberg gauge of global bond returns fell 0.4% on Tuesday, the biggest one-day loss since June 6. While the index is still up for the year, the recent retreat underscores ongoing edginess around owning longer-maturity debt.\n\nMeanwhile the yield to maturity on Bloomberg\u2019s global gauge of government bonds maturing in a decade or longer climbed to the highest level since July 2009. Longer-dated German bond futures also slipped for a fifth straight session in early European trading.\n\nThe selloff in long bonds is boosting demand for so-called steepeners \u2014 a popular strategy that profits when the spread between long- and short-term bond yields widens.\n\nThere\u2019s been precedence for this trade to make money in the past few weeks. New Zealand\u2019s yield curve steepened in August after the central bank followed a widely expected interest-rate cut with a surprisingly dovish statement. Bank Indonesia also unexpectedly cut rates last month.\n\nRising US 30-year yields and falling two-year ones marks \u201can unusual situation reflecting investors\u2019 wish for more compensation to hold long-term bonds,\u201d BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Wei Li wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cWorries about debt sustainability and stagflation risks are keeping the long end of curves under strain\u201d",

Yields on Japan's 20-year notes rose to the highest since 1999 and Australian 10-year bond yields rose to levels seen in July.
