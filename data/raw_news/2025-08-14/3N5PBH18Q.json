  "title": "Malnourished kids arrive daily at a Gaza hospital as Netanyahu denies hunger",
  "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims there is no hunger in Gaza, but malnourished children are regularly arriving at Nasser Hospital.",
  "content": "The dead body of two-and-a-half-year-old Ro\u2019a Mashi lay on the table in Gaza\u2019s Nasser Hospital, her arms and rib cage skeletal, her eyes sunken in her skull. Doctors say she had no preexisting conditions and wasted away over months as her family struggled to find food and treatment.\n\nHer family showed The Associated Press a photo of Ro\u2019a\u2019s body at the hospital, and it was confirmed by the doctor who received her remains. Several days after she died, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday told local media, \u201cThere is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.\u201d\n\nIn the face of international outcry, Netanyahu has pushed back, saying reports of starvation are \u201clies\u201d promoted by Hamas.\n\nHowever, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric this week warned that starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began.\n\nThe U.N. says nearly 12,000 children under 5 were found to have acute malnutrition in July \u2014 including more than 2,500 with severe malnutrition, the most dangerous level. The World Health Organization says the numbers are likely an undercount.\n\nThe past two weeks, Israel has allowed around triple the amount of food into Gaza than had been entering since late May. That followed 2 1/2 months when Israel barred all food, medicine and other supplies, saying it was to pressure Hamas to release hostages taken during its 2023 attack that launched the war. The new influx has brought more food within reach for some of the population and lowered some prices in marketplaces, though it remains far more expensive than prewar levels and unaffordable for many.\n\nWhile better food access might help much of Gaza\u2019s population, \u201cit won\u2019t help the children who are severely malnourished,\u201d said Alex DeWaal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, who has worked on famine and humanitarian issues for more than 40 years.\n\nWhen a person is severely malnourished, vital micronutrients are depleted and bodily functions deteriorate. Simply feeding the person can cause harm, known as \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d potentially leading to seizures, coma or death. Instead, micronutrients must first be replenished with supplements and therapeutic milk in a hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands of kids who need to be in hospital if they\u2019re going to have a chance of survival,\u201d DeWaal said. \u201cIf this approach of increasing the food supply had been undertaken two months ago, probably many of those kids would not have gotten into this situation.\u201d\n\nAny improvement is also threatened by a planned new Israeli offensive that Netanyahu says will capture Gaza City and the tent camps where most of the territory\u2019s population is located. That will prompt a huge new wave of displacement and disrupt food delivery, U.N. and aid officials warn.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry says 42 children died of malnutrition-related causes since July 1, along with 129 adults. It says 106 children have died of malnutrition during the entire war. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, is staffed by medical professionals and its figures on casualties are seen by the U.N. and other experts as the most reliable.\n\nThe Israeli military Tuesday pointed to the fact that some children who died had preexisting conditions, arguing their deaths were \u201cunrelated to their nutritional status.\u201d It said a review by its experts had concluded there are \u201cno signs of a widespread malnutrition phenomenon\u201d in Gaza.\n\nAt his press briefing Sunday, Netanyahu spoke in front of a screen reading \u201cFake Starving Children\u201d over photos of skeletal children with preexisting conditions. He accused Hamas of starving the remaining Israeli hostages and repeated claims the militant group is diverting large amounts of aid, a claim the U.N. denies.\n\nDoctors in Gaza acknowledge that some of those dying or starving have chronic conditions, including cerebral palsy, rickets or genetic disorders, some of which make children more vulnerable to malnutrition. However, those conditions are manageable when food and proper medical treatments are available, they say.\n\n\u201cThe worsening shortages of food led to these cases\u2019 swift deterioration,\u201d said Dr. Yasser Abu Ghali, head of Nasser\u2019s pediatrics unit. \u201cMalnutrition was the main factor in their deaths.\u201d\n\nOf 13 emaciated children whose cases the AP has seen since late July, five had no preexisting conditions \u2014 including three who died \u2014 according to doctors.\n\nAbu Ghali spoke next to the body of Jamal al-Najjar, a 5-year-old who died Tuesday of malnutrition and was born with rickets, which hinders the ability to metabolize vitamins, weakening bones.\n\nIn the past months, the boy\u2019s weight fell from 16 kilograms to 7 (35 pounds to 15), said his father, Fadi al-Najjar, whose lean face showed his own hunger.\n\nAsked about Netanyahu\u2019s claim there was no hunger in Gaza, he pointed at Jamal\u2019s protruding rib cage. \u201cOf course there\u2019s famine,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes a 5-year-old child\u2019s chest normally come to look like this?\u201d\n\nDr. Ahmed al-Farra, Nasser\u2019s general director of pediatrics, said the facility receives 10-20 children with severe malnutrition a day, and the numbers are rising.\n\nOn Sunday, a severely malnourished 2-year-old, Shamm Qudeih, cried in pain in her hospital bed. Her arms, legs and ribs were skeletal, her belly inflated.\n\n\u201cShe has lost all fat and muscle,\u201d al-Farra said. She weighed 4 kilograms (9 pounds), a third of a 2-year-old\u2019s normal weight.\n\nDoctors suspect Shamm suffers from a rare genetic condition called glycogen storage disease, which changes how the body uses and stores glycogen, a form of sugar, and can impact muscle and bone development. But they can\u2019t test for it in Gaza, al-Farra said.\n\nNormally, the condition can be managed through a high-carbohydrate diet.\n\nHer family applied a year ago for medical evacuation, joining a list of thousands the WHO says need urgent treatment abroad. For months, Israel slowed evacuations to a near standstill or halted them for long stretches. But it appears to be stepping up permissions, with more than 60 allowed to leave in the first week of August, according to the U.N.\n\nPermission for Shamm to leave Gaza finally came this week, and on Wednesday, she was heading to a hospital in Italy.\n\nRo\u2019a was one of four dead children who suffered from malnutrition brought to Nasser over the course of just over two weeks, doctors say.\n\nHer mother, Fatma Mashi, said she first noticed Ro\u2019a losing weight last year, but she thought it was because she was teething. When she took Ro\u2019a to Nasser Hospital in October, the child was severely malnourished, according to al-Farra, who said Ro\u2019a had no preexisting conditions.\n\nAt the time, in the last months of 2024, Israel had reduced aid entry to some of the lowest levels of the war.\n\nThe family was also displaced multiple times by Israeli military operations. Each move interrupted Ro\u2019a\u2019s treatment as it took time to find a clinic to get nutritional supplements, Mashi said. The family was reduced to one meal a day \u2014 often boiled macaroni \u2014 but \u201cwhatever she ate, it didn\u2019t change anything in her,\u201d Mashi said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, they moved into the tent camps of Muwasi on Gaza\u2019s southern coast. Ro\u2019a\u2019s decline accelerated.\n\n\u201cI could tell it was only a matter of two or three more days,\u201d Mashi said in the family\u2019s tent Friday, the day after she had died.\n\nMashi and her husband Amin both looked gaunt, their cheeks and eyes hollow. Their five surviving children \u2013 including a baby born this year -- are thin, but not nearly as emaciated as Ro\u2019a.\n\nDeWaal said it\u2019s not unusual in famines for one family member to be far worse than others. \u201cMost often it will be a kid who is 18 months or 2 years\u201d who is most vulnerable, he said, while older siblings are \u201cmore robust.\u201d\n\nBut any number of things can set one child into a spiral of malnutrition, such as an infection or troubles after weaning.\n\n\u201cA very small thing can push them over.\u201d\n\nDagga and Keath write for the Associated Press.

      "text": "- Share via\nIn 2019, when the Thai government announced plans to turn an abandoned tobacco factory in the nation\u2019s smoggy capital into a public park, Bangkok-based landscape architect Chatchanin Sung saw an opportunity to address another of the city\u2019s chronic problems: flooding.\nFor Bangkok, a city of 11 million sitting on low-lying swampland, the management of its water has increasingly become a matter of survival. With the capital facing more frequent and extreme rainfall as well as rising sea levels due to climate change, experts have warned that entire swaths of the city may be underwater within the next few decades.\nLos Angeles knows how to weather a crisis \u2014 or two or three. Angelenos are tapping into that resilience, striving to build a city for everyone.\nLike Los Angeles, where intensifying droughts and floods have revealed limitations of conventional flood control systems like the L.A. River, Chatchanin felt that Bangkok\u2019s own stormwater infrastructure had reached its tipping point.\nDecades of rapid urban development have encased the city with impermeable concrete surfaces that hinder the natural drainage of water. As a result, the city\u2019s network of over 1,600 urban canals, which were once used for transporting goods and people but now primarily act as stormwater channels, are regularly overwhelmed.\n\u201cBecause the canal water mixes with public sewage, the water quality is really bad,\u201d Chatchanin said. \u201cThe park project was an opportunity to absorb and clean this water.\u201d\nTo design the new space, a 102-acre expansion to the pre-existing Benjakitti Park, Chatchanin partnered with Kongjian Yu, a Beijing-based landscape architect who has long advocated what is known as a \u201csponge city\u201d model of urban water management.\nU.S. officials didn\u2019t even bother to ask Australia for help battling the Los Angeles fires.\nThe idea is that, unlike \u201cgray\u201d infrastructure, which is designed to flush water away as quickly as possible, cities like Bangkok can mitigate flood risk simply by making its surfaces more absorbent like a sponge, capturing stormwater before it can turn into runoff that pollutes streets and strains drainage systems.\nTheir winning design, which was opened to the public three years ago, was realized in just 18 months and reflects the idea that such urban water management systems can also provide valuable aesthetic and recreational benefits to communities.\nToday, the former brownfield is a popular bird-watching spot. It features forested walkways alongside badminton and pickleball courts built in repurposed cigarette warehouses, all the while capturing and cleaning water.\nFed by a nearby canal, a long system of wetlands containing thickets of aquatic plants removes pollutants from the water as it winds around the park\u2019s perimeter, releasing what\u2019s left into a large pond dotted with small islets.\nThis, alongside the park\u2019s porous landscape and additional retention ponds, enable it to capture 23 million gallons of stormwater during Bangkok\u2019s rainiest months. The water that\u2019s entering permeable earth instead of being blocked by concrete is helping to replenish natural underground reservoirs that benefit humans and the environment.\n\u201cLast year we had really heavy rains,\u201d Chatchanin said. \u201cThe park also flooded but eventually absorbed it much more quickly.\u201d\nShe pointed to the pond, which no longer had the foul odor or the oily sheen of the canal despite being just a few steps away. Dragonflies buzzed overhead \u2014 a common sign, she noted, that the water is clean.\nChatchanin acknowledged that one park alone can\u2019t fix Bangkok\u2019s water issues. But its modest success might, at the very least, encourage cities to rethink their relationship to water.\n\u201cPeople want fast answers,\u201d Chatchanin said. \u201cBut hiding the problem is no solution. You can\u2019t just raise your house on stilts, or flush out the water. It all comes back in the end.\u201d\nMelanie Winter has long advocated for change along the L.A. River. As she undergoes cancer treatment, she remains focused on healing L.A.\u2019s relationship to water.\nThe idea that cities need to adapt to \u2014 not outrun \u2014 their floods has been a lifelong preoccupation of Kongjian Yu, whose work with sponge cities has earned him the prestigious Oberlander International Landscape Architecture Prize and comparisons to Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York\u2019s Central Park.\nYu traces its beginnings to a near-death experience he had as a child growing up in rural China.\nAt the time just 10 years old, Yu had been playing on the banks of his village\u2019s river, which was more voluminous than usual due to heavy monsoon rains, when he suddenly found himself being swept away by the powerful currents.\nWhat saved him were the river\u2019s reeds and willows, which slowed the water and gave him a chance to pull himself out.\n\u201cMy experience in these villages, my experience with the river and the creek, taught me how to live with nature,\u201d he said.\nLater, Yu earned a landscape ecology degree from Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Design and spent two years in Los Angeles working for SWA Group before returning to China in 1997.\nDismayed that the rapidly modernizing country had lined its cities with concrete dams and channelized waterways, Yu began writing to local mayors, warning of the risks of this approach and advocating instead for \u201crewilding natural water systems.\u201d\n\u201cSponge cities follow three principles: retain, slow down and embrace water,\u201d Yu said. \u201cThat means removing all unnecessary concrete and pavement.\u201d\nAt first, his ideas found few sympathetic ears. Some people, he recalled, sent letters to the Communist Party claiming he was \u201ca spy from the U.S. sent to demolish Chinese infrastructure.\u201d\nBut things changed in 2012, when severe flooding in Beijing destroyed thousands of homes and killed 79 people, some of whom were caught off-guard in the street.\n\u201cEvery sort of paradigm shift, you need a crisis,\u201d Yu said. \u201cPeople dying in the street \u2014 that was the critical point.\u201d\nThe floods prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to adopt Yu\u2019s sponge city philosophy as a national agenda in 2015. Since then, the government has pledged more than $28 billion to help fund over 33,000 sponge city projects in 90 cities, aiming to have them capture and reuse at least 70% of their rainwater by 2030.\nBy 2020, over 40,000 sponge city projects were completed nationwide, contributing to around 3.8 trillion gallons of rainwater being recycled that year, according to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. The ministry noted that this amount was equal to about one-fifth of China\u2019s annual urban water supply.\nMany, like Bangkok\u2019s Benjakitti Park, are wetlands designed to address urban flooding. Others, like a mangrove forest built on the banks of a river in the tropical southern city of Sanya on Hainan Island, act as a natural buffer against saltwater intrusion and coastal erosion from rising sea levels.\n\u201cThe idea is to not build too close to the water in order to create a buffer zone,\u201d Yu said. \u201cInstead of building a wall, we allow the water to come in.\u201d\nThis approach, said Yu, has made sponge city projects uncomplicated and low-cost compared with conventional solutions, deployable just about anywhere.\nBenjakitti Park, for example, cost $20 million and was built by the Thai army, which had little experience in environmental landscaping. Yu scribbled the design on a napkin during his flight to Bangkok to meet Chatchanin, keeping it simple enough to be achievable \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 with only a single excavator.\nStill, the program hasn\u2019t been without challenges.\nWetlands are often breeding grounds for mosquitoes. And with local governments expected to foot up to 80% of the cost for their projects, much-needed investments from the private sector have been slow to materialize. Meanwhile, critics have pointed out that some of China\u2019s most touted sponge cities, like Zhengzhou in Henan province, have still experienced devastating floods.\n\u201cIf a city can\u2019t handle a flood, that means it\u2019s not spongy enough,\u201d Yu said.\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not about getting rid of every piece of concrete. It\u2019s about combining gray and green \u2014 upgrading the current model.\u201d\nSince 2006, Singapore has been turning its own waterways and reservoirs into public parks that also absorb stormwater, an initiative known as the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme.\nIn the Netherlands, a flood-prone country famous for mastering the art of keeping water out with techniques like land reclamation, the government has also experimented with a softer approach, strategically allowing its rivers to flood in certain areas in order to spare others.\nIn L.A., too, there has been a growing awareness that the area\u2019s city\u2019s own impermeable flood control system, which discards billions of gallons of rainwater that might otherwise be stored and reused, is overdue for change.\nWith around 490,000 acre-feet of stormwater available to be captured a year in an area that includes Long Beach and Anaheim, the L.A. area ranks first in the West in stormwater runoff potential and, 19th out of 2,645 urban areas nationwide, according to a Pacific Institute report last year.\nAmong the efforts to make the city spongier \u2014 and therefore less dependent on imported water \u2014 is the Safe Clean Water Program, which L.A. County voters approved in 2018 as ballot Measure W.\nThe program levies a property tax on impermeable surfaces to provide around $300 million a year in grants for municipal stormwater capture projects.\nThe aim of the program is to capture 98 billion gallons annually. Experts have said that projects like this in the upper L.A. watershed could simultaneously help prevent flooding downstream.\nYet officials have estimated that it will take decades to achieve this goal, and progress has been slow.\nJust 30 acres of green space were added to the county in its first three years, according to a report by Los Angeles Waterkeeper, a local watchdog.\nAnd although the program has recently begun to pick up pace, with around $1 billion allocated across 130 projects, Bruce Reznik, the group\u2019s executive director and a member of the Measure W scoring committee, pointed out there are a host of challenges not present in China\u2019s centralized model.\nAmong them are scant federal support and the slow, costly bureaucratic processes involved with the program, such as cleaning up contaminated project sites and getting permits. He estimated that the projects the county needs will cost around $50 billion, 10 times what Measure W funding can provide over the next 20 years.\n\u201cIn terms of expenses, that\u2019s a question a lot of us are asking: Why are these projects so expensive?\u201d Reznik said. \u201cI get that there\u2019s inflation, but man, projects we thought were going to be $10 million are now $25 million. I think we\u2019ve got to figure out ways that we can streamline some of this stuff.\u201d\nSpecial correspondents Chalida Ekvitthayavechnukul and Xin-yun Wu contributed reporting from Bangkok and Taipei, respectively."

Some residents in the flood zone heeded warnings and evacuated after water started escaping the glacier\u2019s ice dam on Tuesday.\nThe Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles from Juneau, home to 30,000 people, and is a popular tourist attraction due to its proximity to Alaska\u2019s capital city and easy access on walking trails. Homes on the city\u2019s outskirts are within miles of Mendenhall Lake, which sits below the glacier, and many front the Mendenhall River, into which the glacial outburst is flowing.\nThe river hit major flood stage Wednesday morning, peaking around 8 a.m. and surpassing a flood level of 16 feet, according to preliminary measurements, breaking a record set last year.\nBasin flooding is a yearly worry\nFlooding from the basin has become an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. Government agencies installed temporary barriers this year in hopes of protecting several hundred homes in the inundation area from widespread damage.\nThe flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier retreated \u2014 a casualty of the warming climate \u2014 and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier, enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually flows down the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday.\nBefore the basin began overtopping, the water level was rising rapidly \u2014 as much as 4 feet per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe city saw successive years of record flooding in 2023 and 2024 \u2014 with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet, about 1 foot over the record set a year earlier \u2014 and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. This year\u2019s flooding had been predicted to crest at between 16.3 and 16.8 feet.\nLast year, nearly 300 residences were damaged.\nA large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 23,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. During last year\u2019s flood, the flow rate in the rushing Mendenhall River was about half that of Niagara Falls, the researchers say.\nA temporary levee is installed\nCity officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The 10,000 \u201cHesco\u201d barriers are essentially giant sandbags intended to protect more than 460 properties completely during an 18-foot flood event, said emergency manager Ryan O\u2019Shaughnessy.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what\u2019s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution, such as a levee. The timeline has angered some residents, who say it\u2019s unreasonable.\nOutburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.\nAttanasio writes for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Man accused of faking his death to avoid rape charges is found guilty of sexual assault in Utah\n- Share via\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 A Rhode Island man accused of faking his death and fleeing the United States to evade rape charges was found guilty late Wednesday of sexually assaulting a former girlfriend in his first of two Utah trials.\nAn eight-person jury in Salt Lake County found Nicholas Rossi guilty of a 2008 rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents took the stand. Rossi, 38, declined to testify on his own behalf. He will be sentenced on Oct. 20 and is set to stand trial in September on another rape charge in Utah County.\nFirst-degree felony rape carries a punishment in Utah of five years to life in prison, said Salt Lake County Dist. Atty. Sim Gill.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the survivor in this case for her willingness to come forward, years after this attack took place,\u201d Gill said in a statement. \u201cIt took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\u201d\nUtah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit in 2018. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.\nMonths after he was charged in Utah County, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.\nHe was arrested in Scotland the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19 after hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos from an Interpol notice.\nExtradited to Utah in January 2024, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.\nHe appeared in court this week in a wheelchair, wearing a suit and tie and using an oxygen tank.\nRossi\u2019s public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas years later.\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to move, you\u2019re allowed to go somewhere else, you\u2019re allowed to have a different name,\u201d attorney Samantha Dugan said.\nThroughout the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of an intelligent man who used his charm to take advantage of a vulnerable young woman. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly.\nThe woman was living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within about two weeks.\nShe testified Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn\u2019t be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.\nDeputy Salt Lake County Dist. Atty. Brandon Simmons told jurors Wednesday that the woman did not consent. \u201cThis is not romantic, this is not her mistaking things.\u201d\nThe woman said her parents\u2019 dismissive comments convinced her not to go to the police. She came forward a decade later after seeing him in the news and learning he was accused of another rape from the same year.\nRossi\u2019s lawyers said the woman built up years of resentment after he made her foot the bill for everything in their monthlong relationship. They argued she accused him of rape to get back at him years later when he was getting media attention, and sought to undermine her credibility with jurors.\nRossi\u2019s public defender did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages seeking comment after the verdict.\nRossi\u2019s accuser in the Utah County case, who testified at this week\u2019s trial, is also a former girlfriend. She went to police at the time of that alleged rape. He is accused of attacking her at his apartment in Orem in September 2008 after she came over to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.\nWhen police initially interviewed Rossi, he claimed she raped him and threatened to have him killed.\nRossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before allegedly faking his death. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008.\nSchoenbaum writes for the Associated Press."

Despite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's claims that there is no hunger in Gaza, the United Nations reports that malnutrition rates among children are at alarming levels, with thousands suffering from acute malnutrition. While Israel has recently increased food supplies to Gaza, experts warn that many children require immediate medical intervention to survive, and the situation is likely to worsen with impending military offensives.",
