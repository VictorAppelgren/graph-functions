  "description": "Cage would be the latest in a line of high-profile actors to take the lead role on the HBO show.",
  "content": "The post Nicolas Cage in Talks to Star in True Detective Season 5 appeared first on Consequence.\n\nNicolas Cage is reportedly nearing a deal to lead the Season 5 of True Detective.\n\nWhile most details regarding the new season are under wraps, but per Variety, Season 5 of the HBO show will be set in the Jamaica Bay area of New York City.\n\nCage would be the latest high-profile actor to take on the lead role in True Detective, following the likes of Jodie Foster, Mahershala Ali, Rachel McAdams, Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson, and Matthew McConaughey. Foster, Ali and McConaughey all earned Emmy nominations for their roles, with Foster taking home both the Emmy and the Golden Globe for her performance in Season 4.\n\nIf Cage does indeed snag the role, it will only be his second lead role on television; last year, it was revealed that the actor is slated to play Spider-Man Noir in a live-action series for MGM+ and Amazon Prime Video. There is no release date for the show, entitled Noir, but it\u2019s scheduled to arrive sometime in 2026.\n\nEarlier this year, Cage revealed that rarely does a day go by \u201cwhere I\u2019m not mistaken for Nick Cave,\u201d he joked during an interview. Soon thereafter, Cave shared a humorous anecdote about a time when he was mistaken for Cage by a drunken fan of the actor while he was living in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cAnyway, these confusions between me and Mr. Cage happen fairly often,\u201d Cave added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m a fan. Have you guys seen Mandy? My God. What a film.\u201d\n\u2022 None Jack White Goes Scorched Earth on Trump and His \"Toadies\" After White House Calls Him \"Has-Been Loser\"\n\nSubscribe to Consequence\u2019s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox.",

      "text": "Jack White has hit back at President Donald Trump after the White House responded to his critique of the \u201cdisgusting\u201d Oval Office decorations with its typical refrain of calling anyone they don\u2019t like a \u201closer.\u201d\nIn a lengthy Instagram post, White pointed out that it wasn\u2019t his previous remarks calling Trump an \u201cobvious fascist\u201d and \u201cwannabe dictator\u201d that drew a response, but rather commentary about \u201cfucking DECOR OF THE OVAL OFFICE.\u201d\nHe continued by saying Trump is \u201cmasquerading\u201d as a Christian, a leader, and a businessman before going after the \u201cprofessional liar toadies\u201d in his administration, like White House communications director Steven Cheung and press secretary Karoline Leavitt, for \u201ccovering up and masking his fascism as patriotism.\u201d\nThe epic statement goes on to blast those who support Trump despite his fleecing \u201cthe American people over and over.\u201d White also wrote that he considers the White House insult as a \u201cbadge of honor,\u201d because anyone who Trump \u201csupports and likes is a villain who gives nothing to their fellow man, only takes what can benefit themselves.\u201d\nWhite\u2019s scathing response came after Cheung gave a statement to The Daily Beast calling him a \u201cwashed up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career.\u201d\nCheung added, \u201cIt\u2019s apparent he\u2019s been masquerading as a real artist, because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of \u2018The People\u2019s House.'\u201d\nRead White\u2019s full statement in all its glory below:\nListen, I\u2019m an artist and not a politician so I\u2019m in no need to give my answer or opinion on anything if I\u2019m not inspired or compelled, but how funny that it wasn\u2019t me calling out trump\u2019s blatant fascist manipulation of government, his gestapo ICE tactics, his racist remarks about Latinos, Native Americans, etc. his ridiculous \u2018wall\u2019 construction, his attacks on the disabled, his attempted coup and mob insurrection and destruction of the sacred halls of congress, his disparaging sexist and pedophilic remarks about women, his obvious attempts at distraction about being a close personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein and his inclusion in the Epstein files, his ignorance of the dying children in Sudan, Gaza, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, his lack of empathy for military veterans and those struggling with poverty, his attempts to dismantle healthcare, his obvious wimpy and pathetic kowtowing to the dictators Putin and Kim Jong Un, his nazi like rallies, his attempts to sell merchandise and products like Goya beans through the office of the President, his fake \u201cgunshot to the ear\u201d that he showed no medical records or photographs of, his constant, constant, constant lying to the American people, etc. etc. etc. No, it wasn\u2019t me calling out any of that, it was the fucking DECOR OF THE OVAL OFFICE remarks I made that got them to respond with insults. How petty and pathetic and thin skinned could this administration get? \u201cMasquerading as a real artist\u201d? Thank you for giving me my tombstone. Well, here\u2019s my opinion, trump is masquerading as a human being.\nHe\u2019s masquerading as a christian, as a leader, as a person with actual empathy. He\u2019s been masquerading as a businessman for decades as nothing he\u2019s involved in has prospered except by using other people\u2019s money to find loophole after loophole and grift after grift. His staff of professional liar toadies like Steven Cheung and Karoline Leavitt have been covering up and masking his fascism as patriotism and fomenting hatred and division in this country on a daily basis.\nAnd I have \u201cample time on (my) hands\u201d? That orange grifter has spent more tax payer money cheating at golf than helping ANYONE in the country. Improve. Anything. There is no progress with him, only smoke and mirrors and tax breaks for the ultra wealthy. So maga folk, enjoy your concrete paving over of the rose garden, your 200 million dollar ballroom in the White House, and your gaudy ass gold spray painted trinkets from Home Depot, cause he ain\u2019t spending any money on helping YOU unless you fit into his white supremacist country club rich idiot agenda.\nWow, he hates who you hate\u2026. good for you, be proud of yourselves, how christian of you all.\nThe only way you can support this conman is because you are a victim of the 2 party system and you \u201cdefend your guy no matter what he does\u201d. No intelligent person can defend this low life fascist. This bankrupter of casinos. This failed seller of trump steaks, trump vodka, trump water, etc. This man and his goon squad have failed upwards for decades and have fleeced the American people over and over. This professional golf cheat, this grifter who has hundreds of thousands of deaths from his inaction of the pandemic on his hands, this man that the majority of the country somehow were fooled into supporting and voting into office (through the flawed electoral college) and their love of reality television stars. Being insulted by the actual White House that this particular conman leads is a badge of honor to me, because anyone who trump supports and likes is a villain who gives nothing to their fellow man, only takes what can benefit themselves.\nAnd no I\u2019m not a Democrat either, I\u2019m a human being raised in Detroit, I\u2019m an artist who\u2019s owned his own businesses like his own upholstery shop and recording label since he was 21 years old who has enough street sense to know when a 3 card monte dealer is a cheap grifter and a thief."

      "text": "Former Mastodon singer-guitarist Brent Hinds has died in a motorcycle accident in Atlanta. He was 51 years old.\nAccording to an Atlanta police report, a male riding a Harley Davidson was killed in a collision after a driver of a BMW SUV failed to yield while making a turn at an intersection. The Fulton County medical examiner\u2019s office has since confirmed Hinds as the driver of the motorcycle.\nHinds\u2019 passing was also confirmed by Mastodon, who issued the following statement via Instagram:\n\u201cWe are in a state of unfathomable sadness and grief\u2026 last night Brent Hinds passed away as a result of a tragic accident. We are heartbroken, shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom we\u2019ve shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has touched the hearts of so many. Our hearts are with Brent\u2019s family, friends, and fans. At this time, we please ask that you respect everyone\u2019s privacy during this difficult time. RIP Brent.\u201d\nBorn in Alabama, Hinds left his hometown for Atlanta to pursue a career in music. Shortly after, Hinds would meet his eventual Mastodon bandmate Troy Sanders, joining the latter\u2019s then-band Four Hour Fogger.\nFollowing the dissolution of that group, Hinds and Sanders would meet drummer-singer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher at a basement High on Fire show, with the quartet eventually forming Mastodon with singer Eric Saner in early 2000.\nSaner stuck through 2001 before exiting the group, which put a new spotlight on Hinds\u2019 gruff and forceful vocals, as well as his virtuosic guitar playing \u2014 both defining aspects of Mastodon\u2019s sound. The band\u2019s first four albums, including the 2004 opus Leviathan, are considered classics of the sludge metal genre, with the band gradually implementing more progressive-rock influences by 2009\u2019s Crack the Skye.\nHinds was instrumental to the band\u2019s commercial ascent, singing and sharing songwriting duties on all eight of Mastodon\u2019s studio albums through 2021\u2019s Hushed and Grim.\nThings appeared to go sour between Hinds and his bandmates in more recent times. In March of this year, the band announced that it was parting ways with Hinds, wishing him \u201cnothing but success and happiness in his future endeavors.\u201d Meanwhile, Hinds took a spiteful tone on social media, calling his bandmates \u201chorrible humans\u201d in comments on Instagram. The remaining members of Mastodon did not formally respond to Hinds\u2019 comments prior to his passing.\nIn the months following his exit from Mastodon, Hinds remained musically active with his other various projects, playing shows around Atlanta. Most recently, he was on tour in Europe this summer with blues rocker Marcus King.\nRumors of Hinds\u2019 death began circulating on Reddit after Tool guitarist Adam Jones posted an image of Hinds on an Instagram story with somber ambient music early Thursday (August 21st). The apparent tribute post was followed by rumors that Hinds was involved in a fatal motorcycle crash in Atlanta.\nThis has knocked the wind out of me. RIP to the great Brent Hinds. pic.twitter.com/BYLcxVgjE5\n\u2014 William DuVall (@WilliamDuvall) August 21, 2025"

      "text": "Nicolas Cage is reportedly nearing a deal to lead the Season 5 of True Detective.\nWhile most details regarding the new season are under wraps, but per Variety, Season 5 of the HBO show will be set in the Jamaica Bay area of New York City.\nCage would be the latest high-profile actor to take on the lead role in True Detective, following the likes of Jodie Foster, Mahershala Ali, Rachel McAdams, Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson, and Matthew McConaughey. Foster, Ali and McConaughey all earned Emmy nominations for their roles, with Foster taking home both the Emmy and the Golden Globe for her performance in Season 4.\nIf Cage does indeed snag the role, it will only be his second lead role on television; last year, it was revealed that the actor is slated to play Spider-Man Noir in a live-action series for MGM+ and Amazon Prime Video. There is no release date for the show, entitled Noir, but it\u2019s scheduled to arrive sometime in 2026.\nEarlier this year, Cage revealed that rarely does a day go by \u201cwhere I\u2019m not mistaken for Nick Cave,\u201d he joked during an interview. Soon thereafter, Cave shared a humorous anecdote about a time when he was mistaken for Cage by a drunken fan of the actor while he was living in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\u201cAnyway, these confusions between me and Mr. Cage happen fairly often,\u201d Cave added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m a fan. Have you guys seen Mandy? My God. What a film.\u201d"

      "text": "Earlier this month, BBC announced it would premiere a new one-hour documentary titled Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home. However, the UK broadcaster has now pulled the special from its schedule just hours before it was set to air on Monday evening, August 18th.\n\u201cThe film has moved in the schedules and we\u2019ll confirm new [transmission] details in due course,\u201d a BBC spokesperson told Us Weekly.\nBBC had been given access to the late metal legend and his family as part of a planned multi-part series titled Home to Roost that was set to chronicle his and wife Sharon\u2019s move from Los Angeles back to England. Instead, the footage was edited into a one-hour documentary in the wake of Ozzy\u2019s passing.\nUPDATE, August 19th: The BBC has explained that the decision to pull the documentary at the last minute was out of respect for the \u201cfamily\u2019s wishes.\u201d Read the full explanation here.\nAt the time of its announcement on August 7th, Clare Sillery, BBC head of commissioning, documentaries, stated, \u201cWe are honored to have had the opportunity to film with Ozzy and his family. The film captures an intimate glimpse into their journey as they prepare to return to the UK. It features family moments, humor, reflection and shows the enduring spirit that made Ozzy a global icon. We hope it brings comfort and joy to Ozzy\u2019s fans and viewers as they remember and celebrate his extraordinary life.\u201d\nOzzy Osbourne passed away on July 22nd, just 17 days after his final performances as a solo artist and with Black Sabbath at the \u201cBack to the Beginning\u201d concert."

Cage then recalled his pleasant meeting with his almost namesake.\n\u201cI do remember that Cave was very nice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were at an animal sanctuary, I believe \u2014 I think Sealy Animal Hospital in Texas \u2014 and he was terrific.

      "text": "Last week, Nicolas Cage made headlines by claiming he is frequently \u201cmistaken\u201d for Nick Cave due to \u201conly one letter\u201d separating their last names. Now, Cave has shared an amusing anecdote about posing as the actor while speaking to a heartbroken man named Diego in Brazil.\nIn his latest Red Hand Files newsletter, the musician responded to fan questions about the Cage interview by recalling a story of drunkenly stumbling into a bar while he was living in S\u00e3o Paulo, where he met the \u201cdowncast\u201d and \u201cmaudlin\u201d Diego, who got really excited when the bartender told him he was talking to Nick Cave. Unfortunately, Diego had mixed up Cave\u2019s name with that of his wife\u2019s favorite actor, Nic Cage.\n\u201cDiego suddenly became super-animated, jumping around on his stool, saying that he loved me, that he was my greatest fan, and so on and so forth. He kept looking at me, then at his drink, shaking his head in wonder and saying, \u2018Nick Cave. Fucking Nick Cave,'\u201d Cave remembered. \u201cI asked him again if he was alright, and he burst into tears and said, \u2018My wife kicked me out. Told me never to come back. She says she hates me.\u2019 I was drunk, so I hugged him and asked, \u2018Why does she hate you?\u2019 He said, \u2018She thinks I\u2019m stupid.\u2019 Then he pointed at me and said, \u2018But she fucking loves you. Just completely loves you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Really?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Yeah, Peggy Sue Got Married is her favourite film. She\u2019s watched it like a hundred times.'\u201d\nWhen Diego started crying again, Cave thought about explaining the mix-up, but chose to play along instead.\n\u201cI said something like, \u2018I\u2019m just an ordinary person like you. Hollywood is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. It can be a cruel place. It gets lonely sometimes,\u2019 and so on,\u201d Cave wrote. \u201cAfter a while, I began to warm to my theme. I told him that making Raising Arizona was the most extraordinary experience and a highpoint in my career, that John Goodman was a fascinating and complex character, and how it was a real privilege to work with the Coen brothers and that they were \u2018masters of their craft\u2019 and all this bullshit.\u201d\nHearing this cheered Diego up and gave him the idea to tell his wife the man he believed to be Nic Cage had said \u201che\u2019s not stupid, and that he\u2019s a good guy.\u201d However, he also wanted Cave to come along and \u201cput in a good word.\u201d Begging off, Cave used the excuse of having to \u201cbe on a movie set early in the morning\u201d and instead penned a handwritten note saying, \u201cDear Ana, Diego is not stupid. He\u2019s a good guy. Love, Nic Cage.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, these confusions between me and Mr. Cage happen fairly often,\u201d Cave concluded in his newsletter. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m a fan. Have you guys seen Mandy? My God. What a film.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Nick Cave has written in his newsletter about being mistaken for Nic Cage. In a 2022 entry, the artist shared that a customs officer once told him that they loved him in Face/Off. In that same entry, Cave wrote about actually meeting Cage in Australia several years back.\nCave is wrapping up his current North American tour with the Bad Seeds (get tickets here) ahead of his summer European solo trek (get tickets here)."
