  "title": "What Is Tesla's 'Joe Mode' & How Do You Enable It?",
  "description": "Tesla's Joe Mode is a feature, introduced with the V10 software update, that reduces the volume of most of the car's audio notifications and alerts.",
  "content": "Whether it's the notifications from a smartwatch or, these days, a smart car, we have access to a constant stream of information like never before. While some of this information is important, there are times when the incessant alerts can get overwhelming. Tesla's \"Joe Mode\" was created to address this situation after owners began asking for a \"quiet mode\" feature, with at least one Twitter (now X) user directly asking Tesla CEO Elon Musk for an \"auto lane correction feature without sound,\" according to the International Business Times. In a post on X, Musk claimed that the feature was named after one of his friends who had requested it.\n\nTesla first rolled out Joe Mode as part of the V10 update to its OS, which was also a game-changer for its self-driving capabilities. The feature is available on all Tesla models, including the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi. While the original inspiration for Joe Mode was to reduce noise levels in a Tesla for the sake of sleeping children, many drivers use it for themselves for a less intrusive and distracting experience while behind the wheel.\n\nWhen activated via the settings menu, Joe Mode reduces the volume of most of the car's audio alerts delivered by the car by about half. These include the sounds for turn signals, parking sensors, seatbelt reminders, Autopilot, and other general notifications. However, Joe Mode does not reduce the sounds of more important alerts and safety warnings. These include Full Self-Driving Takeover, Lane Departure Avoidance, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Forward Collision Warning \u2014 this way, drivers will immediately notice them.",

      "text": "Tesla's Latest Self-Driving Update Is A Game-Changer\nTesla has released a new beta update for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, and it's a big one. The update, which carries the build number v10.12, brings a whole bunch of upgrades for the EVs' turn-taking systems when FSD is enabled. To start, the release notes mention that Tesla has improved the underlying framework that is involved in decision-making for taking left turns. The EV-maker has refined the response of modeling objects, helping the system process noisy data more efficiently.\nAnother notable change introduced by the update is that the frequency of attempts at taking an uncomfortable turn has been lowered, thanks to an upgraded object future prediction system when changing lanes. It is worth noting here that the lane-changing feature packaged with the FSD bundle has already attracted scrutiny in Europe and might be deemed illegal in the region, according to a report from Stern. As for the left turn woes, a drone video from last year showed a Tesla on an FSD beta build taking an unprotected left turn, prompting concerns in the U.S. as well.\nThe update also upgrades the lane neural network architecture in order to enhance the safety of turns at crossing traffic. With the addition of 180,000 new video recordings to the training data cache, Tesla also touts to have improved the accuracy of lane prediction. And to ensure that movement out of restricted space is a hassle-free affair, the planner has received a tweak so that it relies less on lane movement.\nBoosting FSD stability, one turn at a time\nAnother crucial improvement that comes courtesy of the latest update is a reduction in false slowdowns, thanks to enhancements made at recognizing yellow lights at traffic signals and lane behavior. Tesla recently courted a federal investigation for a \"phantom braking\" issue in its cars that caused unexpected deceleration even when the EV was driving at highway speeds. The latest FSD beta update also enhances the understanding of still obstacles, thanks to a wider training data set of 30,000 additional video clips for the aforementioned purpose.\nAdditionally, velocity errors made by the self-driving system when pedestrians and cyclists are close by have also been reduced. Moreover, the detection of far-away crossing objects has received an upgrade with the latest FSD beta build. Motion estimation and lane change planning have also been refined, ensuring a comfortable lane movement if the maneuver involves rough deceleration of the car.\nBut do keep in mind that the update is currently rolling out only for Tesla employees and will only be reaching beta-testers after assessing the performance and stability. Replying to a user's query about the latest FSD beta update, Elon Musk responded on Twitter that the v10.12 update will have a limited rollout and will see a wider release with version 10.12.2 of FSD Beta. Notably, Musk added that with FSD Beta 10.12.2, the company will \"probably\" attain a safety score of more than 95/10."

      "text": "Elon Musk Reveals Best Mode On Tesla: What Is Joe Mode?\nThe relentless query from your children asking, \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d, can grate on your nerves, especially on a long drive. Enter Tesla\u2019s new \u201cJoe Mode,\u201d which comes with the latest V10 upgrade.\nV10 is a massive upgrade that includes Joe Mode, Tesla Theater, Caraoke, Cuphead, Driving Visualization, Automatic Lane Change, Lane Change Visualization, Maps Improvements, Sentry Mode Improvements, Software Update Improvements and the Tesla V10 Application Launcher.\nJoe Mode is a new feature that allows drivers to lower the volume of alerts and prompts while a Tesla electric vehicle (EV) is in motion. It sort of answers a request from one Tesla owner who asked for something to help him keep his children asleep during drives.\n\u201cElon can we get the auto lane correction feature without sound? Young kids in car, want to keep feature on but not wake them up\u201d tweeted @schristakos on July 28.\nTo this, Musk replied with introductory information about the new V10 feature on the same day.\n\u201cHoping to get 'Joe Mode' into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting \u201cJoe Mode\u201d would lower the volume of strident beeps & chimes by half,\u201d tweeted Musk.\nWith the feature now available to all Teslas, Musk revealed that Joe Mode is probably one of the best additions to his fleet of electric cars.\n\u201cJoe Mode is the best mode,\u201d he later tweeted.\nJoe stands for what it\u2019s always stood for: Mr. and Ms. Everybody.\nSome Tesla pundits said the addition of Joe Mode will likely be a welcome feature among parents, especially those that regularly take trips with their young children or babies.\nBesides Joe Mode, the V10 Update also features new entertainment options like \"Cuphead\" and \"Theater Mode.\" There are also improvements to stop sign and traffic light recognition, highway Autopilot and Smart Summon.\nBut V10 isn\u2019t just your ordinary upgrade. It\u2019s a massive one released only on Sunday.\nV10 starts out the release notes with Cuphead. According to Tesla, \u201cCuphead is a classic run and gun action game inspired by cartoons of the 1930s and heavily focused on boss battles. For the Tesla Edition of Cuphead, enjoy the game\u2019s full first Isle as you play as Cuphead or Mugman (in single player or in local co-op).\n\u201cTraverse strange worlds, acquire new weapons, learn powerful super moves, and discover hidden secrets while you try to pay your debt back to The Devil!\u201d\nMusk says Cuphead is his favorite game.\nTesla Theater is rightfully one of V10\u2019s most anticipated features. It gives you the ability to watch videos when your Tesla is parked. Theater mode will allow a parked Tesla to stream videos from both YouTube and Netflix.\nAccording to Tesla, \u201cTesla Theater lets you watch movies and videos when your car is in PARK and connected to WiFi. To launch the Tesla Theater, tap the new \u2018Entertainment\u2019 Icon in the Application Launcher and select the Theater tab.\u201d\nHere comes Tesla \u201cCaraoke.\u201d Tesla says, \u201cSing karaoke to your favorite songs and artists in your car. You can select \u2018Caraoke\u2019 from the Media menu. Tap the microphone icon to adjust whether the vocal track plays while you sgn along.\u201d\nTesla said you can play the tracks while driving. But Caraoke will only display the lyrics when the car is in park for safety reasons, naturally.\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2025. All rights reserved."
