  "title": "I was one of the first people on Royal Caribbean\u2019s new cruise ship Star",
  "description": "Star of the Seas is Royal Caribbean's newest ship, sailing since August 2025 as a sister ship to Icon of the Seas-currently the two biggest cruise ships in the world.",
  "content": "From the minute you walk on board Star of the Seas, you know you\u2019re in for a full-blown, technicolour, all-singing, all-dancing holiday experience. There\u2019s a constant state of exuberance that can be quite overwhelming for the uninitiated, but once you\u2019re a Royal Caribbean fan, they\u2019ve got you for life. Star of the Seas is 1,196ft long\u2014that\u2019s 364 metres\u2014and 20 decks tall, with 18 guest decks for a maximum of 5,610 passengers and two decks for 2,350 international crew. Fittingly, for a Star ship, American astronaut Kellie Gerardi agreed to be godmother after superstar Diana Ross had to pull out from the August 31 maiden voyage.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like on board? At the heart of the ship is Royal Promenade\u2014as on all Royal Caribbean ships\u2014and this is where you\u2019ll find the liveliest bars and a variety of free cafes and restaurants, as well as high-end retail therapy\u2014mostly jewellery and watches. During the day, the ship\u2019s equivalent of a central atrium is comfortably busy, but once the sun sets, it\u2019s party time every night\u2014and on this new Icon class ship, it\u2019s twice the size of those in the rest of the fleet. The top five decks\u2014from deck 15 up\u2014are full of larger-than-life leisure activities\u2014seven pools including the largest pool at sea and the largest swim-up bar at sea \u2013 a waterpark with six record-breaking waterslides, FlowRider surfing, zip wire, a ropes course, rock climbing, mini-golf\u2026 all in Caribbean-style settings with equally colourful bars and eating opportunities. It\u2019s the American dream! There are also a few quieter areas, notably Central Park\u2014another fixture of Royal Caribbean ships since Oasis of the Seas back in 2009\u2014where you can sit among real plants, shrubs, and trees outside a cafe or bar and enjoy the peace and quiet. New for Icon class ships is the other chill-out spot, The Overlook, a gorgeous lounge and bar with a more Ibezan vibe\u2014stylish sofas, day beds and Overlook Pods. These are treehouse-like raised decks near the Overlook bar where you can sit back and gaze out to sea through two levels of floor-to-ceiling wraparound windows.\n\nAs fantastic as the colourful Caribbean-style leisure facilities are, the WOW factor has to be Star\u2019s excellent evening entertainment, particularly its virtually full-length version of Back To The Future\u2014a show that\u2019s taken several years to adapt for Royal Caribbean following its short pre-Covid run in Manchester and the success it\u2019s had in London\u2019s West End. It\u2019s a technical masterpiece with a \u201cflying\u201d DeLorean car. Torque is the new high-energy production for Star\u2019s AquaDome, where divers\u2014some at Olympic level\u2014throw themselves from impossibly high boards into a small pool just 14ft deep in a mesmerising production based on the force that creates rotation\u2014in other words, torque. There\u2019s also an incredible new ice skating show\u2014Sol\u2014featuring World Championship skaters in a story that follows the sun from Miami to Santa Monica and ends with crazy stunt skating that is real heart-in-your-mouth stuff.\n\nSuites include Junior, Family, Lofts, and the amazing Ultimate Family Townhouse\u2014which is three decks tall and all primary colours, with musical stairs and a slide for quickly getting downstairs. Depending on the cruise, it can easily cost $70,000 for a week. Most people will opt for an inside, ocean view, or balcony stateroom, though, and these are a soothing mix of sea blue and sandy beige, which is a relief after the technicolour dream of the ship\u2019s massive range of outdoor entertainment, bars, and cafes on the upper decks. All have a king-sized bed\u2014or twin singles if preferred\u2014and some have an additional sofa bed, although suites have multiple configurations. There are no solo cabins. Most staterooms only have one wardrobe, but there are plenty of drawers, and with Star\u2019s hot weather destinations and laid-back dress codes, you don\u2019t need to bring too much. There\u2019s also a TV with news and sports channels, films, ship information and your account. Most cabins should also have a fridge. Balcony cabins vary \u2013 some are traditional while others are Infinite Ocean View Balcony rooms that have extra living space and a floor-to-ceiling window that drops down to create a half-open window at the touch of a button. You\u2019ll need to pack a plug adapter for laptops, but all cabins have several USB ports of both sizes for charging your phone, and there\u2019s a hairdryer in the cabin. Some also have tea and coffee-making facilities.\n\nThe most important new speciality dining destination is Lincoln Park Supper Club, which offers a menu of eight courses paired with eight cocktails and Chicago-themed songs for $200 a head plus 18 per cent gratuities. Icon\u2019s Empire Supper Club is similar but features a New York-themed menu and songs. Three grab-and-go counters in Aquadome Market, a food hall concept first introduced on Icon, are new for complimentary dining. The five food stalls now include Pig Out BBQ, which serves pulled pork in a bun, Mai Thai for noodles, and La Cocinita for Latin American empanadas. They retain Cr\u00e8me de la Crepe and Feta Mediterranean from Icon. There are 13 complimentary restaurants and snack bars and 14 speciality restaurants, the same as on sister ship Icon of the Seas. Cardiff-born CEO Michael Bayley says his favourite onboard restaurant is Chops\u2014a surf-turf speciality restaurant on all Royal Caribbean ships\u2014but he also recommends the burgers from complimentary Basecamp where passengers pass you on the zipwire. There are too many restaurants to list individually, but other complimentary stand-outs include the spacious Windjammer Marketplace buffet, El Loco Fresh for Mexican favourites, the family-friendly Surfside Eatery, Park Caf\u00e9 (great for a quiet breakfast) in Central Park, and Sorrento\u2019s for pizza in Royal Promenade Neighbourhood. There\u2019s also the three-deck main Dining Room where the waiter-served three-course meals are excellent.\n\nIt\u2019s totally laid-back, fun for all ages, never a dull moment with non-stop entertainment\u2014but with a constant musical soundtrack and party atmosphere that probably won\u2019t suit people who prefer quiet sophistication on a cruise. If you\u2019re a party person you\u2019ll love it, though, from the Swim & Tonic swim-up bar and adults-only Hideaway pool with a DJ and beach resort atmosphere in Chill Island Neighbourhood, to Frightening Bolt\u2014one of the six Waterpark slides\u2014and the genuinely scary Crown\u2019s Edge skywalk and ropes course that leaves you dangling 154ft above the sea in Thrill Island Neighbourhood. You can calm down later with a cocktail at Royal Promenade\u2019s 1400 Lobby Bar, which sells 100 newly designed cocktails to celebrate 50 years of Royal Caribbean shipbuilding innovation. The 1400 name refers to NB1400, the number given by Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland to the Icon class project. The bar\u2019s signature cocktail is a 1400 \u2013 a tequila drink that comes with a smoke bubble which bursts when you take your first sip. After dinner in one of the numerous restaurants, you can go to see Back To The Future, the ice skating show Sol or AquaTheatre\u2019s Torque\u2014and there are more shows debuting soon. Alternatively, Dueling Pianos is fun, Boleros has live Latin music, you can entertain the crowd at Spotlight Karaoke, have a laugh with Royal Comedians at The Attic, or listen to live jazz at Lou\u2019s in Central Park\u2014all for free.",
