  "content": "These team players represent the best of what it means to do some much-needed heavy lifting out of the spotlight.\n\nSean Hartley\u2019s path to the kitchen was far from traditional. He studied physics at the University of Washington, working for a scientist who was a Nobel Prize winner. NBD.\n\nAfter graduating, he crewed on a fishing boat in Alaska and then landed a job at a beloved spot in Seattle called Longshoreman\u2019s Daughter, before joining the team at the venerable Cafe Lago. That was a memorable gig largely because he met his wife, Julie, there (she was the pasta maker). Then he landed at Tom Douglas Restaurants. During those early days in the early 1990s, Hartley worked alongside some incredibly talented chefs who would go on to helm their own award-winning restaurants: Holly Smith at Cafe Juanita, John Sundstrom from Lark and Matt Costello, who was chef at the Inn at Langley on Whidbey Island for many years.\n\nWhen the company began expanding, Hartley recalled a humbling moment in a well-attended team meeting during which Douglas gave him a back-handed shout-out: \u201cHe said something like look how far Sean has come. I almost had to fire him and now look at him,\" he said, laughing.\n\nHartley went on to run the popular Palace Kitchen for nearly 10 years until another opportunity in the company came up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was ever super creative as a chef. I ran a good team, but I was looking for a lifestyle change with a young kid at home and a spot came up.\u201d\n\nInitially, he wasn\u2019t that excited about the title of facilities manager, but that role has expanded and evolved. In the past decade-plus, he\u2019s worked on building out or refreshing 15 restaurants.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helped that I had experience in the kitchen\u2026 an architect doesn\u2019t have the same perspective,\u201d he said. The process is \u201cvery non-linear.\u201d A new concept often starts with a hand-drawn sketch. \u201cIt\u2019s Tom\u2019s vision, and during the process, plans might change. It\u2019s all about being flexible.\u201d\n\nThe latest reboot is Mr. Fish, formerly known as Seatown. The casual spot near Pike Place Market is all about nautical colors, the vivid blue and white adding a fresh feel to a menu that\u2019s fish-and-chips and chowder focused. The kitchen\u2019s also been fine-tuned to deal with the volume of business that\u2019s driven by summer visitors.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next on Hartley\u2019s to-do list? He\u2019s looking to eventually pass on the nuts-and-bolts knowledge of the workings of a busy restaurant group to others. Before cuing up the dark theme song from \u201cSuccession\u201d, let\u2019s get real. Hartley\u2019s driving ambition involves showing up and supporting: \u201cIt\u2019s really about taking care of people on our team so they can take care of the guests.\u201d\n\nOh, and you\u2019ll still occasionally find him in the kitchen, maybe mixing up a batch of from-scratch tonic water at Palace, a practice first launched nearly 20 years ago by another veteran Tom Douglas Restaurants superstar, Gretchen Geisness, who now manages Mr. Fish and Half Shell.\n\nDeni Reilly and her husband, Patrick, opened The Majestic Grill in a historic building in downtown Memphis some 20 years ago. To many, the affable Deni might present primarily as chef Patrick\u2019s No. 1 fan and business partner, but that\u2019s just a portion of the big picture.\n\nAs a longtime supporter of arts organizations with a deep background in hospitality, Deni approaches her role with warmth and enthusiasm: \u201cAt heart, I\u2019m a storyteller and an events gal. So those passions combined with my previous experience (she worked for The Center for Southern Folklore, The Blues Foundation and Memphis in May, and as Director of Operations for a Destination Management & Events Company now called Leo Events) just naturally work in the restaurant world,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the many hats she wears \u2013 including Mom \u2013 bringing people together and building a team that feels like family is what she most enjoys.\n\n\u201cMy proudest achievement is the work family we\u2019ve built and the culture of hospitality professionalism that continues to grow within our walls and beyond. We\u2019ve got folks who\u2019ve been with us since before we opened our doors. Hosts and prep cooks who are now senior managers. After the pandemic, we re-opened after being closed for eighteen months with 100 percent returning staff. We have more than one career staffer getting ready to retire whose kids now work here. And our alumni include three sommeliers, two restaurant owners, a handful of executive chefs, and multiple small business owners.\u201d\n\nAside from the non-glamourous tasks like reviewing the sales and shift reports, dealing with emails, managing social media, following up on any pressing issues, as well as meetings with business and operations managers, Deni still finds time to visit with guests, and do a little menu R&D. She recently worked with the cocktail team at the second location of Cocozza to come up with a Slurpee Martini, a sort-of silly tribute to the building\u2019s previous tenant, a 7-11.\n\nWhat she loves about her job is the way no two days are ever the same: \u201cIt\u2019s like staging a live show or putting on a different event each day. You can be completely prepared, have all the players in their right spots, trained, well-rehearsed and ready to go, but it's never exactly the same from shift to shift. And that is where the magic happens! Those places, in between putting out fires, where you witness your team make someone\u2019s day, or you see a new server take ownership of our culture or watch the kitchen just work in perfect synchronized harmony and feed hundreds of people delicious dishes in just a few hours. Those are the moments.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s also the rewards \u2013 and challenges \u2013 that comes from working with your spouse: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not for the faint of heart. But, seriously, we\u2019ve worked really hard to create a place where people learn to embrace the joys of working in a restaurant, as a team really having each other\u2019s backs, and creating special moments for the people who walk through our doors.\u201d\n\nHave a restaurant MVP story? We\u2019d love to hear about it, please share in the comments section.",

      "text": "A surprisingly saucy preparation served at Duke\u2019s Seafood in Seattle seems like a perfect way to open up a conversation about the very survival of the species of fish that travels from the ocean up rivers to spawn. When the owner of this restaurant group warns salmon are in danger of extinction, many shrug. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s important to listen up.\nEat it to save it\nSouthern food historian Poppy Tooker has for decades been repeating a phrase her grandmother taught her: Eat it to save it. That catchy mantra could easily apply to wild salmon, which has seen its numbers steadily decline along the West Coast. Consumers and chefs have taken the bait, simply switching to farm-raised fish even after it\u2019s been proven to be unhealthy to eat and harmful to the environment.\nDuke Moscrip has spent much of his career building a series of popular restaurants in and around Seattle, an ongoing endeavor that led him to the icy waters of Alaska. He spent many summers on board fishing vessels, observing how the fish were handled after they were caught. Those lessons led him to adopt a practice of serving only wild Alaskan salmon that had been frozen shortly after being caught at his restaurants.\nIt also opened his eyes to the dwindling fish runs along the West Coast, which led to his latest project. He established Duke\u2019s Damsel on a Train Foundation with Damsel Cellar\u2019s co-owner Heather Andersen to draw attention to the fish\u2019s fate. The organization hosts fundraisers to benefit various efforts to address the pressing issue.\nThere\u2019s reams of documents bolstering the cause, but the importance of protecting this species might be best discussed over a serving of one of Duke\u2019s signature salmon preparations.\nMoscrip shared his recipe for Colonel Mustard\u2019s Wild Salmon:\nIngredients\n6 ounces coho salmon\n1 ounce olive oil\nPinch of sea salt\n1 ounce Dijon mustard\n2 ounces white wine\n4 ounces heavy cream\n1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped\n1 tablespoon fresh herb blend\nPrep Notes:\nSeason and pan sear salmon. Flip salmon, when \u00be done, deglaze pan with white wine and add herbs, Dijon and Cream and incorporate and reduce. Sauce should thicken, but still be abundant enough to nearly cover plate. Serve with Jasmine rice and steamed veggies. Place salmon in middle on top of veggies and rice to give it height.\nServe it with the 2024 Damsel Cellars Dineen Vineyard S\u00e9millon. Duke\u2019s restaurants features special releases from Damsel, a portion of the proceeds from each glass pour donated the Foundation.\nListen to Moscrip and Heather Andersen discuss the restoration efforts their foundation is tackling on a recent episode of Hot Stove Radio with chefs Tom Douglas and Bridget Charters.\nFor additional information on the importance of addressing this issue, check out the restoration efforts spearheaded by Save Our Wild Salmon.\nAnd for an excellent source of frozen wild salmon, take a deep dive into the shipable offerings from Wild Alaskan Company."

      "text": "Here\u2019s a guide for weekenders, seasonal cruisers and the staycation set that\u2019ll definitely get those steps in. Ready to work up an appetite? Let\u2019s go.\nBut first, a post-airport bakery stop\nA dear friend flew up from San Diego for a quick visit, game for anything, especially when it comes to food. After a traffic snarled early morning pickup at SeaTac, I made a beeline to one of my favorite bakeries, Sea Wolf.\nThis family-owned venture started by brothers Jesse and Kit Schumann as a wholesale bread-baking operation has blossomed into a must-visit venue. Get there before 9 to avoid the lines and while you\u2019re at the counter, be sure and consider the densely packed, utterly delicious date cake. It\u2019s more of a stout version of banana bread, delivering the intense sweetness of those dates without getting sticky fingers. Also ask about the croissant brittle, a pastry that amps up the crunch.\nA very special place to stay\nAfter checking into the city\u2019s newest luxe accommodations \u2013 1 Hotel in the heart of the South Lake Union \u2013 we took a walk down to the water. This neighborhood is best known for being home to Amazon and other tech-driven businesses, but its rich history goes back to the city\u2019s earliest days. The Virginia V is permanently docked near MOHAI, offering a glimpse at one of the last surviving examples of the Mosquito Fleet. The steamship moved goods up and down the coast and now serves as a floating museum.\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of floating, head over to The Center for Wooden Boats if you\u2019re interested in renting water craft or learning more about the region\u2019s nautical history.\nWant to enjoy a bird\u2019s view of the neighborhood with an adult beverage? Head to the rooftop known as m bar, where the extensive lineup of cleverly named cocktails includes a rare sighting of a espresso martini with a half shot of spirits.\nWe had a dinner reservation at La Loba, the sensational new restaurant at 1 Hotel and by the time we were seated, the dining room was buzzing with the kind of energy that feels like the best kind of first date. Our congenial server steered us towards a few cool starters on the Spanish-inspired menu, though it\u2019d be a stretch to call the generous portions tapas.\nBig hits among those first course choices were the Patatas Bravas, which had an almost croissant-like texture \u2013 micro-thin slices of potato layered and fried crisp \u2013 and something called Green Tartare. This dreamy mashup of avocado, zucchini and bell pepper was served with a crispy rice cracker crown for scooping up the plant-based spread.\nThe Double R Ranch braised beef cheek proved to be the perfect entree to share, an ultra-rich, deeply satisfying preparation showcasing that butter-tender cut. Maitake mushrooms and pickled onions added complexity and contrast to the saucy beef, which was perched on velvety potato puree.\nA very good morning\nAfter an eye-opener at nearby Monorail Espresso, we headed to Pike Place Market for a deep dive into that special place. The mission? Grab some tasty souvenirs for my friend\u2019s pantry back home. Scored spectacular smoked wild salmon from Pike Place Fish, tinned \u201cseacuterie\u201d at DeLaurenti, tea at Market Spice and some Rose Harissa at World Spice. That ingredient delivers a fiery finish to all sorts of dishes, though my pal loves it best on scrambled eggs.\nAs the shopping bags were growing heavy, it was time for lunch at one of my faves, Pasta Casalinga, where we ordered one of everything. This is a rare place where you can get away with that kind of order, especially if you\u2019re sharing and we had a third join our party of two to enjoy the \u201cfrom the ocean\u201d, \u201cfrom the farm\u201d, \u201cfrom the garden\u201d selections that change regularly. A brilliant kale pesto was a standout, offering a fresh take on the classic. So good.\nBefore leaving the Market, we picked up a few things to make dinner at my home base before walking back through the new waterfront park and then meandering through the beautiful Olympic Sculpture Park. Just like that, it was time for that return to the airport. It was a quick trip to the Emerald City, yet we managed to pack in a lot of highlights.\nHere are a few more suggestions for a pedestrian-driven tour of downtown Seattle and surrounding neighborhoods:\nHead to Pioneer Square for a drink at that area\u2019s first rooftop bar, Firn at the Populus Hotel, explore the excellent Old School Italian menu at Darkalino\u2019s, enjoy a well-made espresso drink at Cafe Umbria.\nKeep walking and you\u2019ll hit Chinatown/the International District, where a wander through Uwajimaya is always a pleasure, followed by dim sum at Jade Garden or Dough Zone Dumpling House. Though it\u2019s a few more steps down the road, Pho Bac Sup Shop is well worth the effort.\nInterested in a moveable feast tour of the Seattle Center?
