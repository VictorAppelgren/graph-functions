The merger combines Paramount\u2019s sprawling global distribution network and prized film and TV library with Skydance\u2019s production and technological capabilities.\n\nGAMCO was listed in Paramount\u2019s 2025 proxy statement as the second-largest shareholder with 11.7% of the company\u2019s Class A stock.\n\nMarangi said Paramount ignored GAMCO\u2019s concerns and did not put the deal to a vote of minority investors, as it said was customary.",

      "text": "Joe Rogan once again rips ICE raids: \u2018Great, you\u2019re going to get rid of the landscaper\u2019\nJoe Rogan once again criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration raids, telling a MAGA lawmaker on Wednesday that people were protesting deportations because they were thinking, \u201cGreat, you\u2019re going to get rid of the landscaper.\u201d\nRogan pressed Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) to defend her claims about recent immigration protests and challenged the scope of federal enforcement, using his podcast to question whether the government has gone too far beyond its promise to target dangerous offenders.\nDuring a conversation Wednesday on \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d Luna alleged that demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in June were fueled by \u201cChinese money.\u201d\nRogan said he was open to the idea, but reminded her that the public anger also reflected fear about how the raids were being carried out.\n\u201cI absolutely believe this is true,\u201d he said, before adding, \u201cbut also, it was in reaction to some of the ICE raids.\u201d\nRogan described why he thinks the response was so strong, arguing that people recoiled at the idea of officers grabbing ordinary workers.\n\u201cIt was a visceral reaction that a lot of people had to the idea of people just showing up and pulling people out of schools and pulling people out of Home Depot and pulling people that were just hard-working people,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what freaks people out.\u201d\nHe later summed up how many voters saw the administration\u2019s pledge, saying the expectation was the removal of violent criminals rather than tradesmen and day laborers.\n\u201cWhen people thought about ICE, they thought, \u2018Great, we\u2019re going to get rid of the gang members,\u2019 they didn\u2019t think, \u2018Great, you\u2019re going to get rid of the landscaper.\u2019\u201d\nThe exchange underscored a growing split between tough rhetoric around border enforcement and what critics say is the reality on the ground.\nRogan has backed President Trump and his hardline agenda, but he has increasingly criticized how immigration sweeps have been conducted.\nThe podcast host pushed back on the familiar refrain that migrants should simply \u201cget in line\u201d legally, arguing that many of those doing low-wage work lack the resources to navigate the system.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just a landscaper, you\u2019re just a guy who lives in a Third World country and you want a better life, and you say, \u2018I heard you can get across, and I heard when you get across, you can get work\u2019 \u2014 like what is that guy going to do?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThat guy doesn\u2019t have the money to hire a lawyer.\u201d\nLuna responded by pointing to the policies of the Biden and Obama administrations, but the two agreed on two themes often heard from both sides of the debate: Companies should not rely on undocumented labor, and the border should be secure.\nLast month, Rogan criticized enforcement tactics as overly broad, saying the focus has landed on the wrong targets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d he said on his show last month.\n\u201cThe targeting of migrant workers \u2014 not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers. Just construction workers. Showing up in construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?\u201d\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would have signed up for that.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly pledged to pursue \u201cthe worst of the worst,\u201d but a review by ABC News shows that people without criminal records have increasingly been swept up, reinforcing Rogan\u2019s argument that the practice no longer matches the promise.\nWhile the podcast host praised Trump\u2019s broader agenda, he has rejected aspects of its execution. He has also criticized the administration on unrelated issues, accusing it of \u201cgaslighting\u201d around the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the large majority of those in ICE custody at the end of June had no criminal convictions, a data point that contrasts with campaign promises to focus on serious offenders.\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Post that \u201c70% of ICE arrests are of illegal aliens who have charges or convictions in the US.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg: That statistic does not account for foreign fugitives, terrorists, gang members, and human rights abusers or individuals who have criminal records in foreign countries,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nThe Post has sought comment from Luna and the White House."

She was acquitted on four additional counts of wire fraud. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 10.\nShe faces up to 20 years in prison.\nThe Post has sought comment from the duo.\nThe couple\u2019s Scottsdale-based fintech firm, Blueacorn, which the couple co-founded in 2020, processed over $12.5 billion in PPP loans \u2014 with somewhere between $250 million and $300 million going to the company\u2019s ownership, including Hockridge-Reis.\nBlueacorn received over $1 billion in taxpayer-funded processing fees for facilitating PPP loans but spent less than 1% ($8.6 million) on fraud prevention and only $13.7 million on eligibility verification, according to a congressional investigation.\nThe PPP was an $800 billion federal loan initiative launched in 2020 to help small businesses keep workers employed during the pandemic.\nIt was part of a broader effort \u2014 including grants, tax credits and emergency loans \u2014 aimed at stabilizing the US economy and preventing mass business closures and layoffs.\nInvestigators claimed that the couple used the proceeds to enrich themselves personally.\nThe former KNXV-TV anchor claimed that her actions were a \u201csincere effort to support small businesses\u201d in navigating a chaotic government problem during an era of \u201cunprecedented need.\u201d\nAs part of the proceedings, Congress said it obtained a video created by Reis and Hockridge-Reis showing off large amounts of cash in a bar on Dec. 21, 2021. According to public records, Reis relocated to San Juan, Puerto Rico, which has no capital gains tax, following his work at Blueacorn.\nAnother video months earlier showed Hockridge and Reis on the balcony of a luxury beachfront apartment in San Juan, The Post previously reported.\nA congressional report found that Blueacorn routinely failed to properly vet applicants and charged illegal \u201csuccess fees\u201d to borrowers \u2014 violating Small Business Administration rules.\nThe report also detailed how Blueacorn\u2019s leadership instructed staff to prioritize speed over accuracy.\nHockridge-Reis was once a familiar face in Arizona households. She spent seven years as an anchor at KNXV-TV, the ABC affiliate in Phoenix, and had previously worked as a reporter for CBS News Radio in London.\nShe was nominated for an Emmy and named \u201cFavorite Newscaster\u201d by Arizona Foothills Magazine.\nHer conviction marks one of the highest-profile PPP fraud cases to date involving a public figure.\nFraud related to COVID-19 relief programs was unprecedented in US history, with losses estimated in the hundreds of billions.\nThe PPP, Economic Injury Disaster Loans and unemployment insurance programs were especially vulnerable \u2014 with watchdogs reporting widespread misuse, insider abuse and systemic failures in fraud prevention."

It\u2019s always hard, but we don\u2019t want to be a company that every quarter is laying people off. It is important for us to get done what we\u2019re doing in one big thing and then be done with it.\u201d\nEllison, the CEO of Paramount Skydance, Shell and other brass touted their vision to revive the flagging company during a press conference last week in New York.\nThe son of billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said restructuring could \u201cexceed\u201d the $2 billion target, but declined to provide a timeline of when the axe would fall.\nHe also said that Paramount\u2019s new executive team doesn\u2019t buy into the idea that a company can be cut into growth \u2013 a statement reiterated at the LA press conference attended by Ellison, Shell, Paramount+ leader Cindy Holland, TV Media boss George Cheeks, film heads Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein and Chief Operating Officer Andy Gordon.\nEllison has already made some bold moves since taking the reins of Shari Redstone\u2019s media empire.\nOn Monday, Paramount announced that it acquired the exclusive rights to show all events from the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the US from TKO Group in what amounts to a $7.7 billion, seven-year deal, beginning in 2026.\nThe news helped catapult the company\u2019s stock, which trades under the ticker PSKY, by 37%. On Thursday, it gave back some of those gains, losing 4%, to close at $14.38."

Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug. 7.\u201d\nThe approval from the FCC, headed by President Trump-nominated chair Brendan Carr, comes three weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired in October.\nHelping to seal the thumbs up from the FCC, by a 2-1 vote, were assurances from Skydance CEO David Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and investment partner RedBird Capital, of their commitment to unbiased journalism that represents diverse viewpoints.\nSkydance said it would appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of editorial bias or other concerns about CBS in an effort to promote transparency and increased accountability.\nParamount also eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to align with the Trump administration\u2019s view that such affirmative action policies are discriminatory.\n\u201cAmericans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\u201d Carr wrote in a statement Thursday.\n\u201cIt is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance\u2019s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\u201d\nBoth Skydance and Paramount declined to comment after the news was announced late Thursday.\nMedia heiress Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, is set to receive $1.75 billion in cash once the deal closes and she will exit the merged company\u2019s board of directors.\nThe FCC\u2019s approval to transfer broadcast licenses for 28 owned-and-operated CBS television stations to the new owners comes a week after CBS canceled \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d calling it a \u201cpurely a financial decision.\u201d\nThe top-rated late-night show had reportedly been losing roughly $40 million a year.\nTrump had sued Paramount for $20 billion, alleging the Harris interview had been deceptively edited in order to interfere with the 2024 election.\nCBS denied any wrongdoing but settled the lawsuit in order to avoid a costly legal battle that could potentially hold up its mega-merger with Skydance.\nEarlier this week, Trump said the settlement was actually for $36 million, with the new owners agreeing to spend $20 million in public service ads for pro-MAGA causes.\n\u201cAfter months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,\u201d said Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the dissenting voter for the merger.\nUnder the deal, Skydance \u2013 which has produced blockbuster hits \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d and \u201cMission:Impossible -The Final Reckoning\u201d \u2013 and Gerry Cardinale\u2019s RedBird Capital will buy Redstone\u2019s shares of National Amusements, Paramount\u2019s majority owner.\nThen, Skydance will merge with Paramount to become \u201cParamount Skydance Corp.\u201d It will be controlled by the Ellison family but will remain publicly traded.\nDavid Ellison will take over as chairman and chief executive, while Jeff Shell, a former CEO of NBCUniversal, will grab the reins as president.\nRedstone served as Paramount\u2019s chair starting in 2019, when she reunited two family-controlled media companies, Viacom and CBS, which had been separated for more than a dozen years.\nAt the time, the daughter of the late media mogul Sumner Redstone hoped to better position the company to compete with the world\u2019s entertainment giants.\nParamount has since shed billions of dollars in market valuation as it struggled to navigate an entertainment business upended by the streaming video revolution."

      "text": "Famed money manager Mario Gabelli, one of the largest shareholders in Paramount Global, urged the Federal Communications Commission to halt its review of the transfer of broadcast licenses in the media giant\u2019s $8 billion merger with Skydance.\nGabelli requested the delay so that he could probe for \u201cpotential fiduciary and/or federal securities violations\u201d against Paramount\u2019s minority shareholders, according to a letter he sent to the agency made public Tuesday.\nHis investment firm, Gabelli Value, owns approximately 13% of Paramount\u2019s Class A common stock \u2013 the second largest Class A shareholder behind Shari Redstone and National Amusements \u2013 and roughly 900,000 Class B shares.\n\u201cGabelli Value respectfully requests that the Commission defer resolution of the application until Gabelli Value has completed its inquiry and determined whether to initiate litigation against Paramount\u2019s board of directors, NAI, and/or Skydance for breach of fiduciary duty (or aiding and abetting) under Delaware law and/or whether the transaction violates federal law. We are available to discuss this matter at your convenience,\u201d the letter said.\nGabelli filed the request with the FCC on Nov. 8 \u2014 four days after Paramount released a 699-page S-4 prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission about the Skydance deal, which would hand control of assets that include CBS to the independent studio owned by tech heir David Ellison.\nHowever, Gabelli\u2019s letter to the FCC claims Paramount\u2019s \u201cproxy statement does not provide adequate disclosures concerning the process leading up to board approval of the merger or the fairness of the merger consideration.\u201d\n\u201cImportantly, it does not provide stakeholders with adequate information to determine whether consideration that should be paid to shareholders is being diverted to [Shari Redstone\u2019s] NAI for its controlling stake in the Company.\u201d\nSkydance and Paramount declined comment.\nRedstone, the daughter of the late media tycoon Sumner Redstone, is expected to walk away with a nearly $2 billion windfall for her her controlling stake in Paramount.\nAfter filing his request for more details last week, Gabelli told TheWrap: \u201cI want my clients to have the option of continuing to own the voting shares. Why should they get squeezed out?\u201d\n\u201cSecondly, are they worried I would discover a whole bunch of numbers that would indicate that they should get more money because the other guy got more money? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\nThe complex deal includes Paramount buying the smaller Skydance and then merging with the company.\nClass B commons can then sell some Paramount stock for $15, a premium to their current price of $11.45\nThe controlling Class A shareholders get $23 or a chance to convert their shares into Class B common, as The Post previously reported.\nThe deal \u2014 which does not require a shareholder vote \u2014 is expected to close in the first half of 2025."

  "argos_summary": "Mario Gabelli's investment fund has filed a class-action lawsuit against Paramount Global, alleging that controlling shareholder Shari Redstone unfairly benefited from the $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media, receiving $60 per share compared to the $23 offered to public shareholders. The lawsuit claims that Paramount ignored concerns raised by Gabelli regarding transparency in the deal and did not allow minority investors to vote on it. Meanwhile, Paramount's president, Jeff Shell, announced plans for significant job cuts and restructuring following the merger, which has faced scrutiny and legal challenges.",
