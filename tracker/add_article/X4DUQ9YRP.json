      "summary": "The Social Security program, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt 90 years ago, currently provides benefits to nearly 69 million Americans but faces a projected shortfall by 2034. Recent changes, including the Social Security Fairness Act and new tax laws, have accelerated concerns about its sustainability, with proposals for privatization and benefit reductions being debated. Despite the program's popularity, political leaders have yet to propose a comprehensive solution to ensure its long-term viability.",
