  "title": "I wish I had this high-tech study sidekick when I was in school",
  "description": "This tool is probably the secret to straight As.",
  "content": "With the back-to-school season here, it can be tough to know exactly what tech you need to actually get ahead for the upcoming school year. On the tablet front, the iPad is a college favorite, allowing students to take notes, read books, work on assignments and collaborate with other students with ease. However, the iPad's ability to do literally everything makes it quite a distraction machine as well, with students often finding themselves losing hours to Netflix, TikTok, and that one iMessage group chat that seemingly always picks up during science lecture.\n\nFortunately, I recently spent some time with the Boox Note Max, which offers an elegant solution to this problem. This E Ink tablet functions not only as a powerful note-taker, but thanks to its Android 13-powered OS, can download textbooks, function as a word processor, access school tools like Canvas, and even play music, making it a great device for students looking for a high-tech solution this semester that will give them the tools they need to succeed without any of the distractions.\n\nEnough power to get your work done\n\nThe Boox Note Max features a huge 13.3 inch screen, giving note-takers and artists alike a huge canvas to work with. The massive screen size also handles multi-tasking well, so if you're reading a textbook while keeping one eye on a Canvas or Google Classroom discussion, you'll have plenty of space to do so. While the device is very wide, at just 4.6mm thick and weighing 615 grams, it\u2019s portable enough to stash in a tote bag or medium-sized backpack.\n\nThough E Ink tablets can sometimes be lacking in power, the Boox Note Max is refreshingly zippy, powered by an Octa-Core CPU with 6GB of RAM. The tablet is able to easily handle basically anything you throw at it, handling multitasking across apps for reading, productivity, drawing and note-taking without even one stutter.\n\nUnfortunately, the Boox Note Max does not feature a front light, which puts the kibosh on late night study sessions under the covers. However, the screen looks great under the afternoon sun, in the shade, or by lamp light with an HD E Ink Carta 1300 screen, which displays everything from RSS feeds to your Spotify playlists in crystal-clear monochrome.\n\nThe Boox Note Max is currently available on the Boox official website as well as Amazon for $690 and is only available in white.\n\nWhat I liked about the Boox Note Max\n\nEverything you need and nothing you don't\n\nThough it has been several years since my college days, one of the issues that I had in school that I still struggle with in my work life is focus. And while I found great utility in using the Boox Note Max's split-screen function to bring a second display to my work set up, I found that using it to just read while listening to music helped me really focus on what I was reading thanks to its no-frills interface and E Ink display. No matter whether you are reading a textbook, scrolling through discussion posts, or just marking up your syllabus, the Boox Note Max invites you to focus and be present with whatever you're working on, making it a perfect school companion.\n\nI also really loved the device's onboard note-taking software. While you're free to use Google Keep, Evernote, or whatever other note-taking app you like, I found the pre-installed Boox Notes app to be pretty powerful, allowing me to mix typed and handwritten notes with annotations, links, drawings and diagrams with ease, and then quickly share them with others, either digitally as a PDF though an app like Gmail or Slack or with a scannable QR code that works with almost any device. The app also includes some unobtrusive AI features that allowed me to turn my often-illegible writing into text in seconds, which was super convenient.\n\nAnd speaking of writing, taking notes or drawing on the Note Max Pro feels remarkably like writing on paper down to the tactile scratchy feel of the screen under your stylus' nib. The included BOOX Pen Plus stylus does not need charging and works extremely well for general writing. Artists may want to spring for the BOOX Pen 2 Pro which offers a bit more of a precise experience, but if you're just taking notes or jotting down to-do lists, the included pen is fine, and\n\nI didn't experience any lag or delay when annotating PDFs, ePUBs or just writing in the Notes app.\n\nInstalling third party apps is also a snap, with everything from library reading app Libby to drawing app ibisPaint was quick and easy, and almost every third-party app supported multitasking, which helped me put the Boox Note Max's giant 13.3-inch screen to good use.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was how good the refresh rate was at keeping up with scrolling media. In an attempt to inject some fun into my day I downloaded online comics reading app Webtoon and was able to scroll down through several chapters of Fullmetal Alchemist easily without almost any ghosting at all, which is an issue I've had with a lot of E Ink tablets before. And while I wouldn't recommend using the Boox Note Max to watch a movie on Netflix, I was surprised that the little 30-second video previews on Webtoon actually played without incident.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the Boox Note Max\n\nNo front light is a bummer and battery life could be better\n\nWhile the Boox Note Max's lack of a frontlight brings your pen closer to the writing surface, I have to say that for me at least, the trade-off wasn't worth it, as it the lack of a light severely limited where I could use the device. While partially sunny or lightly shaded areas outside provide a great experience, and the device looks great under indoor lighting (like in a classroom or office) if you're trying to get some work done on the quad in full sun or are attempting a late-night study session while your roommate is asleep, you'll unfortunately run into some issues with the Boox Note Max.\n\nI was also a little disappointed by the Boox Note Max's battery life, as just a few hours of listening to music, reading, and writing were enough to drain my battery to 10% before my workday even ended. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the weeks-long battery life of other E Ink tablets, but I did feel a little let down that, much like an iPad or a laptop, this was another device that would need to be plugged in at the end of the day after moderate-to-heavy usage.\n\nShould you buy the Boox Note Max?\n\nI wouldn't characterize the Boox Note Max as a fun device. You can't play games or watch movies on it, and while scrolling media works fine with minimal ghosting, this is one tablet that rewards users for slowing down and focusing. It's best described as a tablet that is designed to help students and workers get their tasks done efficiently and easily, and if that sounds like something that you could use in your everyday life, I can't recommend the Boox Note Max enough. Though it is a little bit pricey at almost $700 (double the price of a standard iPad), if you're looking for an all-in-one solution for word processing, productivity, note-taking and completing assignments, this tablet has everything you need, and nothing you don't.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Boox Note Max's split screen function is powerful for multitasking.\n- The tablet's Android system allows for diverse app usage in black and white.\n- Horizontal split-screen mode is the most practical and useful multitasking option.\nI only have a single monitor as part of my home office setup, so a lot of the time my workday consists of me looking at my computer screen at whatever piece I'm writing or editing, and then checking my phone screen to respond to Slack messages or email notifications, and then going back to my computer monitor again. It can be a bit exhausting, and it's definitely not great for my eyestrain as there is a lot of blue light exposure happening over a typical 8-hour shift.\nFortunately, while reviewing the Boox Note Max, I had an interesting idea: How might this tablet function as a secondary screen? As you might guess from the name, the Boox Note Max is designed to take notes, but since it is an Android-based tablet, you can download virtually anything from the Google Play store on it, and I quickly found some interesting applications for my specific work-related use case, thanks to some powerful multitasking that is built in to this E Ink tablet.\nBoox Note Max\n- Storage\n- 128GB\n- CPU\n- 2.8GHz Octa-core CPU\n- Memory\n- 6GB\n- Operating System\n- Android 13\n- Battery\n- 3700mAh\n- Display type\n- E Ink\n- Colors\n- Monochrome\n- Expandable Storage\n- No\n- Weight\n- 615g\nSplit screen on the Boox Note is actually pretty powerful\nDo more than just take notes\nBecause the Boox Note Max uses Android 13, users can download essentially any app they want, and the tablet will display it in black and white. This made it perfect for text-based applications, and I found myself propping the tablet up next to my monitor and then firing up split screen mode to keep an eye on my Slack messages, the Pocket-lint homepage, and RSS feeds, which all displayed helpfully in black and white with minimal ghosting. I could also make on-the-fly notes and annotations using the tablet's stylus to ensure I didn't forget anything I wanted to mention during my next meeting.\nI also like listening to music while I work and using the split-screen mode to keep my Spotify player pumping out the jams through the tablet's onboard speakers while responding to messages or reading an article was also a pretty handy function.\nThough not every app is compatible with split screen mode (the Boox Note Max's settings app being one unfortunate example) I found most apps that I used for work were able to be used simultaneously in this mode, and switching apps on the fly while remaining in split screen was surprisingly quick and easy.\nHow to multitask on your Boox Note Max\nIt takes just a few taps to get started\nThere are two ways you can use split-screen on the Boox Note Max: horizontal and vertical. Though there may be some use cases for vertical (which displays the different apps on the top and bottom of your screen) I found the device's horizontal mode to be a lot more practical, at least for me. To get started with this mode, the process is simple\n- Open the first app you want to use\n- Swipe down from the top right corner to open the Control Center\n- Tap the Split Screen button\n- Choose horizontal or vertical\n- In the second window, tap the Apps icon (it looks like a Y) and select which app you want to use on the second half of your screen\n- Adjust the width of each window by dragging the line between the two apps.\n- Swap apps by swiping up from the bottom of the window where you would like to change apps.\nIf you decide you want to exit split screen, simply swipe down from the right and de-select the Split Screen option."

      "text": "Summary\n- Scheduled messages in iOS 18 allow for punctual greetings at midnight.\n- Use the scheduling feature in Messages by tapping 'Send Later.'\n- Reschedule, edit, or delete messages freely before the delivery time.\nI'm on a winning streak with being the first person to wish my family and friends a happy birthday since iOS 18 came out. How do I always remember to send a message at midnight on the dot, you ask? I don't. Most of the time, I've been peacefully passed out for a couple of hours already when that cheery message goes through. I don't lose sleep, and my loved ones think I'm just that considerate and punctual.\nUnfortunately, I'm really not that punctual. I'm also terrible at remembering birthdays, let alone remembering to text people for anything in the first place. Luckily, iOS 18 makes me look like a hero with what I consider its hallmark feature -- which sure isn't the god-awful new Photos app layout. It's the ability to schedule messages for later.\nHere's how to do it yourself.\nApple iPhone 16\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.1-inch 2556 x 1179 pixel resolution Super Retina XDR, 2000 nits, 60Hz\n- RAM\n- 8GB\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB\n- Ports\n- USB-C\nThis year's iPhone 16 line blurs the line between the \"Pro\" and the base-level iPhone by offering a new camera button and the Action Button, alongside the A18 chip.\nHow to schedule a message on your iPhone\nYou can use any Apple device with iOS 18 or later\nUnfortunately, you can't schedule messages for more than two weeks out, so make sure any special events are written down in your notes or calendar. But within that 14-day threshold, you can schedule messages to your heart's content.\nHere's exactly how:\n- Open the Messages app on your iPhone.\n- Tap the '+' icon on the left side of your text box.\n- Select Send Later.\n- Tap on the time that populates in the text box and choose what time you want your message to send. Note that the text box has become a dashed line. That means it will only be sent at the time you've chosen.\n- Enter your message, and then tap the up arrow to schedule it.\nYour message will maintain the dashed outline until it is sent at the designated time.\nChange the time, edit the message, or delete the message\nSometimes you change your mind\nIf you have a change of heart, you have until the delivery time to change the time, edit the message, or even delete it.\nTo reschedule a message:\n- Open the Messages app and find the conversation with the message you need to reschedule. If you don't see it right away, scroll all the way to the bottom. It might be hiding there.\n- Tap the little 'Edit' beside the date -- and above your scheduled message -- and either reschedule it by tapping 'Edit Time' or send it immediately by choosing 'Send Message.'\nTo edit a message you scheduled:\n- Open the Messages app and find the conversation with the message you need to reschedule.\n- Tap and hold the message bubble, and tap 'Edit.'\n- Now make any changes and tap the blue checkmark to confirm your edits, or hit the grey 'x' to revert to the original message.\nTo delete your scheduled message:\n- Open the Messages app and find the conversation with the message you need to reschedule.\n- Tap and hold the message you want to cancel, and then tap 'Delete.'\nWhen would you want to use this?\nFrom convenience to planning\nIt's not just for birthdays, obviously. The schedule feature is fantastic for work if you don't want to bother someone with a message after hours, but don't want to forget to send it in the morning. I also use it to schedule follow-up messages with my social media clients to check in on how they like a particular set of posts I made for them the week before.\nIt does wonders for a scatterbrained mind -- like mine -- that can only lock in on text messages for a few minutes a day. If you haven't started taking advantage of this feature yet, now's your sign."

Whether you have an iPad Mini, a regular iPad, or an iPad Pro, Apple's tablets are ideal to carry with you for presentations, work trips, or even to lie in bed with and watch YouTube. The brilliant Liquid Retina display (or OLED screen if you're using the iPad Pro) makes the colors on anything pop and the interactive touchscreen allows for precise movements.\nI've used iPads for both personal and professional purposes and have found that there are certain apps that help keep me on track and organized. Below are some of my favorite productivity-focused iPad apps.\niPad Pro (M4)\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB\n- CPU\n- M4\n- Operating System\n- Apple iPadOS\n- Battery\n- 38.99-watt-hour battery. Up to 10 hours of surfing the web using Wi-Fi.\n- Display type\n- Ultra Retina XDR display (OLED)\nThe 13-inch iPad Pro packs its powerful M4 chip into a very thin, light, and portable design. It also offers a brighter, more vibrant OLED screen display.\n1 Asana\nKeep all of your tasks organized\nAsana is a super handy platform for project management, whether you're working on a big team project or just trying to keep your life organized. Projects go through a lot of different stages, and sometimes it's hard to keep track of where things stand. With Asana, you can move a project from the early brainstorming phase to completion all within one card. You can also break it down into individual tasks, so managers (or even just you) can easily follow along with progress.\nIf you don't want to use this simple interface for business, it also works great for home projects as well. Monthly tasks like budgeting, bills, and goals, as well as daily tasks like chores, schedules, and more, can all be tracked easily in Asana. It can also send you daily reminders and push notifications to your iPad for tasks so you're always on top of them.\nAsana\nAsana is a project management tool that helps you track personal tasks as well as the status of a team's mission. It has an easy-to-navigate interface and works with iPad, iOS, and browser.\n2 Anytype\nSecure and encrypted for your protection\nThere are plenty of times throughout the day when you have an idea and don't remember it in time to jot it down. With Anytype on your iPad, that's no longer a problem. It lets you quickly jot down notes and ideas, and the best part is that everything is protected with end-to-end encryption, so your notes stay completely private. Your notes can also be made accessible when you're offline, which will let you flesh them out when you don't have an internet connection.\nBut that's not all Anytype can do. Anytype also syncs across all of your other devices and lets you stay up-to-date on all of your things. You can store bookmarks, documents, tabs, tasks, and more on a customizable home screen. It's the perfect way to safeguard your info and stay organized on the move.\n3 Goodnotes 6\nJot down notes with the Apple Pencil\nIf you're used to lugging around multiple paper notebooks for meetings, it's time to simplify your life with an iPad and Goodnotes 6. While you can use Goodnotes 6 without an Apple Pencil, having one makes note-taking much smoother and more precise. You can combine handwritten notes with text on the same page and fill out your notes in a more organized manner. Plus, you can record audio notes and sync them with your writing -- perfect for prepping a presentation.\nGoodnotes 6 also comes with AI-powered features that can summarize text and help match the tone you're going for. It even includes customizable paper templates to make it feel like you're writing in a real notebook. This syncs with iCloud, OneDrive, DropBox, and Google Drive, allowing you to back up what you make.\nYou can get three notebooks with the free app. The first unlimited plan starts at $9.99 per month.\nGoodnotes 6\nGoodnotes is a notes app that makes it easy to jot down notes with your Apple Pencil on your iPad. It will recognize a typo as you're writing and fix it for you.

  "argos_summary": "The Boox Note Max is a 13.3\u2011inch E\u2011Ink tablet running Android\u202f13 that offers a large, high\u2011resolution monochrome display, an octa\u2011core processor, 6\u202fGB RAM, and a 3,700\u202fmAh battery. It excels at note\u2011taking, document annotation, and multitasking with split\u2011screen, and its built\u2011in stylus and AI\u2011assisted OCR make it ideal for students and professionals who want a distraction\u2011free workspace. However, the lack of a front light limits use in low\u2011light conditions, and battery life under heavy use is only a few hours, so the device is best suited for daytime study or office work. Priced at about $690, it is more expensive than a standard iPad but offers a focused, paper\u2011like experience that can replace a laptop for many tasks.",
