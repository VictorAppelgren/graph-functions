  "content": "AI is increasingly closing the gap between technical expertise and creative expression. By interpreting code, design, and language with remarkable fluency, it can give everyday users access to tools that once took years of training to create.\n\nThat's the vision driving Tanmay Kejriwal, a software builder and founder of MakeX, a mobile-first platform that turns simple lines of plain English into fully functional apps. This allows anyone, whether a restaurant owner, educator, or teenager with an idea, to develop, edit, test, and launch apps within minutes, with no coding or design knowledge required.\n\nThe Engineer Behind the Platform\n\nTanmay's entry into tech began with a spontaneous visit to a university hackathon, where he first witnessed the immediacy and creative potential of software. \"I saw how through coding I could create real-world impact,\" he recalls. The experience pushed him to switch majors at Texas Christian University, trading mechanical engineering for computer science, and to begin a series of hands-on experiments.\n\nAmong them were Open Planner, a student productivity tool adopted by 10,000 users on campus, and Clipbot.tv, an AI platform that turned Twitch clips into viral content for social media, and which was later bought by a Y Combinator-backed company.\n\nTanmay developed these projects when AI was starting to become more specialized, with generative tools like chatbots and image generators gaining popularity, and he began looking for a way to expand this technology's accessibility, which led him to start developing an early prototype of MakeX. This proved to be a breakthrough moment for Tanmay, as the platform saw 500 users sign up after the first two weeks of its beta launch, crashing its servers in the process.\n\n\"That was the golden moment,\" he recalls, \"which made us realise that this is the idea that I wanted to work on.\"\n\nHow MakeX Allows Anyone to Create Their Dream App\n\nNow fully launched, MakeX aims to make app development simple and fast. Users simply describe their idea in plain English, and in less than 15 seconds, they receive an app made for iOS with functional features and a custom-built user interface.\n\nThis is fueled by an infrastructure that Tanmay himself set up using several language models fine-tuned to handle unique tasks. Anthropic's Claude 4 generates the underlying code, OpenAI's GPT-4o handles design aspects like app icons and splash screens, and Google Gemini organizes the UI flow to provide a coherent and intuitive experience.\n\nUsers get a private link to test and preview their app. Once it's ready to launch, they can share it directly through a public URL without needing to upload it to an app store, creating a direct path from idea to interaction.\n\nOver the past two years, MakeX has created more than 2,500 apps for over 600 users, generating platforms like journaling tools, calorie trackers, and podcast summarizers, giving regular people the ability to develop tailored apps with zero friction and high speed.\n\nWhile the platform is already delivering strong results, Tanmay and his team are focused on making it even better. They're currently developing a proprietary AI model trained on output data from over 2,500 generated apps. This will give the system the technical capability to closely understand more specific requests and produce increasingly tailored outputs, expanding what MakeX can enable its users to create.\n\nTanmay's Vision to Level the Playing Field for AI\n\nThrough MakeX, Tanmay aims to introduce a new creative model for software to be created and distributed. His goal is to allow the technical layer to fade into the background and users can simply focus on what they want their app to do and what they want it to look like.\n\nThis idea aligns with the latest direction that software development has taken over the past few years and the role AI has in this larger shift. He explains that AI has only grown more widespread over the years, as shown by ChatGPT going from 30 to 800 million users in under two years. As a result, the time between idea and execution is rapidly shrinking.\n\nMakeX aims to speed up that trend, giving anyone the power to leverage this technology.\n\nUltimately, Tanmay envisions MakeX as \"the TikTok of apps: a place where anyone can instantly generate a functional app and where others can scroll, discover, and use these vibecoded apps just like they'd discover videos or content.\"\n\nGiving the Edge to the Non-Technical Creator\n\nAs more platforms explore AI's potential, Tanmay Kejriwal is developing a platform that puts everyday users at the center of creation. With MakeX, he's shifting the power of app development into the hands of anyone with an idea, turning AI from a behind-the-scenes tool into a direct interface for building.\n\nIn doing so, he's helping to create a more open, inclusive ecosystem where anyone can build, share, and shape the tools they want to see in the world.",
