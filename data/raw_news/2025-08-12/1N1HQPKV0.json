  "description": "Mayor Pureval reportedly says decisions on additional charges will be made \u2018as soon as possible.\u2019",
  "content": "Cincinnati leaders are reportedly calling on members of local government to bring charges against a white man seen slapping a black man during a viral confrontation that left six injured and led to seven arrests in late July.\n\nIn a public discussion hosted by Ohio state Rep. Cecil Thomas on Monday, community members met to discuss concerns over the city\u2019s handling of the investigation into the fight, WLWT reported.\n\n\u201cThe video speaks for itself,\u201d Thomas said, according to the outlet. \u201cThe method by which this situation has been handled raises serious questions as to whether there is bias involved in this investigation. It also brings into question the lack of integrity and whether there is something else to hide.\u201d\n\nAdditional footage of the assault obtained by WLWT shows the unidentified white man allegedly hitting a black man in the face, leading to several others joining in on the beatdown that ultimately left six people injured.\n\nA separate video obtained by Fox News Digital depicts a white man repeatedly using a racial slur toward the group in the moments before the fight.\n\nThe update comes over two weeks after the incident broke out on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets in the early morning hours of July 26.\n\nLast week, a grand jury indicted Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, on three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\nIf convicted, they each face the possibility of up to 29 years in prison.\n\nA seventh individual, 32-year-old Gregory Wright, was arrested Monday afternoon and is facing charges of alleged aggravated riot and aggravated robbery, according to the Hamilton County Jail.\n\nAll seven suspects are black, sparking questions from local leaders about the investigation and why the white man has not been charged.\n\n\u201cOur community is restless, and they\u2019re watching,\u201d Pastor Leslie Jones said, according to WLWT. \u201cSince you don\u2019t think young people vote, old folks do. And they have told me they know how to vote, they know how to answer. If you don\u2019t prosecute this gentleman \u2013 and we\u2019re not talking about \u2013 we\u2019re demanding prosecution in the next 24 hours.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval told WLWT that any decisions regarding additional charges will be \u201cmade as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with everyone\u2019s frustration,\u201d Pureval said, according to the outlet. \u201cI have been clear about my expectations that, in order to preserve both public safety and fairness, anyone involved in perpetrating the violence should be charged. Until all participants are held accountable, justice hasn\u2019t been fully served. And I\u2019m grateful that community leaders and residents are continuing to come together to make their expectations clear.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office and Rep. Thomas did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.",

      "text": "Cincinnati viral beating bodycam shows cops at scene of brutal fight as six arrested face new charges\nPolice have released new body camera footage showing the moments officers responded to the viral downtown Cincinnati beating that left six people injured and led to six arrests.\nIn the footage in the immediate aftermath of the viral beatdown in downtown Cincinnati, officers are seen arriving at the scene at approximately 3:25 a.m. on Saturday, July 26.\nFox News Digital previously reported that a lone 911 call brought law enforcement to the scene.\n\u201cI\u2019m 62 years old. I was attacked. I got attacked by multiple people,\u201d a man in a polo green shirt is seen telling a Cincinnati Police Department officer.\n\u201cWhat led up to the fight?\u201d the officer is heard asking.\n\u201cDon\u2019t really know,\u201d the man replied, sounding dazed.\n\u201cIt just got out of the bar and it just got crazy.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, you didn\u2019t get into it with anybody inside the bar?\u201d the officer replied.\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d the man replied.\n\u201cNot at all. I got side-punched. It wasn\u2019t a fair fight at all.\u201d\nIn another officer\u2019s body camera video, also obtained by Fox News Digital, a female Cincinnati Police Department officer is heard asking witnesses if the \u201cargument was about wings.\u201d\nThroughout the footage, a group of individuals is seen purchasing and disputing wings at a local food truck in the early morning hours of Saturday, July 26.\n\u201cAre they fighting about wings?\u201d the officer is heard asking as the officers arrive at the scene.\n\u201cI heard it was the one white guy who called the guy a n\u2014\u2013,\u201d a man replied.\n\u201cDo you know who swung first?\u201d the woman asked.\nThe update comes the same day all six individuals arrested in connection with the viral beating in downtown Cincinnati have been indicted by a grand jury and are facing additional charges.\nPatrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, are each charged with three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\u201cWhat I saw on video is not the Cincinnati I know and love,\u201d Hamilton County Prosecutor Connie Pillich said.\n\u201cThese charges hold those involved in the attack accountable.\u201d\nThe update comes nearly two weeks after a bystander video showing the brutal beatdown on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets went viral, sparking national outrage and forcing local leaders to answer for the beating that broke out around 3 a.m. on July 26.\nWitness video obtained by Fox News Digital shows a man repeatedly yelling racial slurs at a group before being violently thrown to the ground and kicked repeatedly.\n\u201cI saw a little ruckus going on, saw people kind of scuffling, so kind of zoomed in, and once my phone kind of focused in, I saw the so-called victims being pretty aggressive toward the group of people that were already standing out there,\u201d witness Jay Black told Fox News Digital.\nBlack added that he watched the man get knocked to the ground, before getting up and start fighting again.\n\u201cOnce he got up, you know people were kind of backing off of him, but he was kind of still going at people, you know, and using racial slurs,\u201d Black said.\nHe told Fox News Digital that \u201ccontrary to what people think,\u201d there were actually \u201ca lot of people\u201d trying to break up the fight.\nThe fight ignited a national firestorm as local leaders were left to answer for the apparent lack of police presence in the downtown area when the fight occurred after it was revealed that only 11 officers were stationed downtown the night of the brawl.\nIn a press conference held last week, Cincinnati Police Chief Theresa Theetge revealed that, of the approximately 100 individuals present on the street corner at the time of the fight, only one person called 911.\n\u201cThat is unacceptable to not call the police,\u201d Theetge said.\n\u201cTraffic was horrendous. People saw this. They were fighting in front of traffic. Why didn\u2019t people call us?\u201d\nOne of the victims in the attack, Holly, can be seen in additional footage being violently slammed to the ground and knocked unconscious as she tried to split up the fight.\n\u201cI remember being afraid, terrified,\u201d Holly told Fox News Digital.\n\u201cI just remember my life flashing before my eyes, and all I can think is, \u2018Dear God, I hope my children know that I love them.\u2019\u201d\nHolly revealed the horrific fight left her with brain damage and life-altering injuries, including a severe concussion.\n\u201cI\u2019m having someone help take care of me financially, mentally and physically,\u201d Holly said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very humbling, it\u2019s very embarrassing to not be able to just be able to hang out by myself. I think that\u2019s the scary part, to not know just how deep the damage is going to be.\u201d\nCincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval also weighed in on the violence that lit up social media at a press conference last week.\n\u201cThis was an awful incident, and our law enforcement has been working quickly and effectively to bring all responsible to justice,\u201d he said while standing alongside other city officials and leaders.\n\u201cLet me be clear, there is no place for violent crime in Cincinnati, whether it\u2019s a fight or gun violence. We will pursue those responsible and we will hold them accountable no matter who they are.\u201d\nHowever, Pureval has since come under fire for his handling of the city\u2019s law enforcement, with mayoral challenger Cory Bowman, who is also Vice President JD Vance\u2019s half-brother, slamming city leadership for what he believes is relaxed bail policies allowing violent offenders back on the streets.\n\u201cThere are things from City Hall that are showing that the police are not supported the way they need to,\u201d Bowman told Fox News Digital.\n\u201cThey are unable to do their jobs because they\u2019ve been told time and time again that they have to use restraint in certain things instead of enforcing the law. They\u2019re told to dial back, and then what happens is that we have prosecutors and judges that have a catch-and-release system.\u201d\nIn a previous statement, Council Member Anna Albi also condemned the brutal beating, while vowing to support the community\u2019s police force.\n\u201cUnder no circumstances is it ever acceptable to condone such awful violence,\u201d Albi said.\n\u201cOur greatest responsibility as elected officials and city leaders is to ensure the safety of our community. That is why this City Council continues to invest in supporting and growing our police force while simultaneously investing in social services to foster safe and healthy communities.\u201d\nIf convicted, the suspects face the possibility of 29.5 years in prison."

Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "5 charged in horrifying viral Cincinnati brawl that left woman knocked out cold\nFive people have been charged over a vicious beatdown on a Cincinnati street after footage of the wild brawl went viral.\nThe suspects\u2019 names were not released, and Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge declined to specify the charges \u2014 but cautioned that more arrests were expected.\n\u201cWe have five we have charged, and anticipate more,\u201d Theetge told reporters Monday, two days after the 3 a.m. Saturday incident that she referred to as a \u201cfight.\u201d\nAccoding to online videos, the \u201cfight\u201d consisted of a mob stomping on the head of a man cowering on a downtown street, while a woman was cold-cocked and knocked out, with blood pouring from her mouth, after she tried to intervene.\nTheetge, however, tried to downplay the brawl, calling the weekend \u201coutside of this one incident, an amazing success for this city\u201d while explaining that a baseball game and music festival happening in Cincinnati that night both went off without a hitch.\n\u201cWe had one incident \u2014 one incident \u2014 late Friday night into Saturday morning that is getting all the attention and undoing the good stuff that happened this weekend,\u201d she said.\nThere was also no update given on the condition of the targets of the assault \u2014 with Theetge saying she didn\u2019t know if anyone was hospitalized afterward, but that the victims \u201cappeared to be as well as could be expected\u201d when police arrived.\nBut Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said he spoke to the woman who was knocked out, claiming she was a mother named Holly who told him \u201cnot a single local or state official had yet reached out\u201d to her besides \u201cone police detective.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a single working mom who went to a friend\u2019s birthday party,\u201d the former GOP presidential hopeful said. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital.\u201d\nCincinnati Fraternal Order of Police president Ken Kober told WLWT the victims suffered \u201cpretty serious injuries\u201d and would be \u201crecovering from this for a while.\u201d\nTheetge, however, disputed critics\u2019 characterization of the downtown police presence, saying officers were on scene within six minutes of receiving a call about the brawl and that it had ended and dispersed by the time they arrived.\nBut she also appeared to blame residents of her city who saw the fight for any delay in response \u2014 saying upward of 100 people were either involved or watching, but that only a single person called 911.\nThe chief also admonished the press, accusing reporters of playing video of the incident that only showed \u201cone version of what occurred\u201d \u2014 though she did not elaborate on what she meant by that.\nExactly what sparked the fight remains unclear, but footage indicated it started as an argument between two men before quickly escalating.\nThe man taking the brunt of the attack was white, while his assailants appeared to be largely black.\nOne witness told WXIX somebody made a racial comment before the beating began, though those reports are unconfirmed and it is unclear who supposedly said what.\nFootage of the brawl \u2014 which was extremely graphic, and included the man at its center being body-slammed at one point \u2014 spread rapidly online over the weekend, with Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk even weighing in and calling for arrests.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the full context, but what I saw is a mob of lawless thugs beating up on an innocent person,\u201d the vice president and former Ohio senator said.\n\u201cWhere I come from at least, when you have a grown man who sucker-punches a middle-aged woman, that person ought to go to jail for a very long time,\u201d Vance added."
