      "summary": "The article discusses Labor Day camera deals, noting that new gear prices are higher due to tariffs, but discounts remain available on models like the Panasonic Lumix S9 and Nikon D850. It highlights that the best bargains are often found in used gear from retailers such as Adorama and B&H Photo, where savings can reach 15‑25% for high‑condition items. The piece also lists other tech and appliance promotions, but emphasizes that camera deals are limited and second‑hand options are preferable for significant savings.",
