      "feedback": "This draft has useful cross‑asset threads but it needs a tighter, numbers‑driven 0–3 week narrative, a formal causal chain, and explicit catalysts/invalidations; actionable edits below (cite only IDs): (1) Fix horizon framing by naming concrete, time‑bound drivers and thresholds with numbers drawn from sources: Labor Day promo wave with exact deltas (Pottery Barn Indio Eucalyptus Outdoor Sectional: 20% off, $2,794 → $2,235; $559 savings) from 6U8VYS7BA; tariff backdrop with precise levels (auto tariffs cut from 27.5% to 15%; pass‑through risk to prices and margins per S15934PBQ); add BeeStation Plus as a hardware demand signal (8TB built‑in, around $400) per 8VMO3PFEO; note mixed consumer‑durable signals like Douglas tires pricing ($50–$120 per tire) and mixed durability reviews per 4B5JK15SY. (2) Build a crisp, testable causal chain: tariffs → auto pricing/margin pressures (Toyota NA income loss cited; 15% cap as a potential ceiling) → consumer prices and capex expectations; Labor Day demand → near‑term retail margin/CPIs; tech hardware substitution pressure (BeeStation) → hardware/semis sentiment; include a separate cross‑asset risk: regulatory/SEO shifts in Beasley’s case that could ripple into team spending and cap allocations (XB5ZRN1VP). (3) Structure explicit scenarios and invalidation: base case (tariffs held near 15% with solid Labor Day demand), bull case (credible tariff relief sustains modest inflation and risk‑on tone), bear case (tariff rhetoric escalates or CPI runs hot, crowding rate‑sensitive sectors); define invalidation events (tariff >20% talk, CPI surprise; Beasley‑related cap/expense changes). (4) Quantify every assertion where possible: state Beasley’s max re‑sign under Detroit’s non‑Bird rights ($7.2m) and the non‑taxpayer MLE ceiling (~$15.0m) with the Nets’ cap space as a limit; quote BeeStation’s $400 price and 8TB built‑in; cite the 20% Labor Day discount and the $2,235 price precisely; (5) Reconcile conflicts transparently: acknowledge sources that push tariff pass‑through (S15934PBQ) versus reports emphasizing seasonal factors or limited price effects, and present both views with attribution; (6) tighten prose for clarity and keep the core citations tight to IDs (6U8VYS7BA, S15934PBQ, 8VMO3PFEO, 4B5JK15SY, XB5ZRN1VP); (7) summarize a monitor list for next steps: weekly CPI/retail data, tariff updates, Labor Day momentum metrics, and Beasley‑related cap/roster chatter; (8) trim extraneous cross‑market detail that doesn’t map to 0–3 weeks, ensuring the piece remains a crisp, signal‑rich horizon analysis rather than an extended narrative.",
