  "title": "Will Commercial Samples Ship Duty Free Anymore After De Minimis Changes? It\u2019s Complicated.",
  "description": "For the most part, commercial samples entered the U.S. duty-free. Will that continue?",
  "content": "For the most part, commercial samples entered the U.S. duty-free. Will that continue?\n\nLow-dollar shipments from overseas are about to get more expensive. The days are ticking down until the de minimis exemption for customs duties expires as part of President Trump\u2019s global tariff policies, nixing the ability for businesses to import goods worth $800 or less into the country duty-free. But some founders might wonder: Can I still bring in commercial samples duty-free?\n\nCommercial samples are products brought into the country that are not intended for sale within the U.S. Samples help businesses evaluate a product\u2019s form, fit, function, and quality, and allow companies to make any tweaks to products before manufacturing them in bulk. Those in the retail industry, for example, might bring in sample garments from different manufacturers to evaluate an item before committing to move forward with a larger shipment. \u201cYou\u2019ll see companies that\u2019ll do thousands of samples at specific times of the year depending on their fall, winter, or spring releases,\u201d says Bernie Hart, vice president of customs and trade management business development at Flexport, a transportation and supply chain management company. The de minimis rule that exempts low-value imports from tariffs is set to expire on August 28, which will impact millions of shipments. About 4 million de minimis shipments enter the U.S. each day, according to the White House.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says that in 2024, 1.36 billion de minimis shipments entered the U.S., up from 134 million a decade prior. The Trump administration said its decision to walk back the de minimis exemption largely is to stop countries from \u201cexploiting this system to flood the American market with cheap goods,\u201d according to a July Homeland Security press release. The report also claims this is intended to curb the inflow of fentanyl, a powerful opioid responsible for thousands of fatal overdoses, because the exemption purportedly helped cartels and others smuggle drugs into the U.S. With a few exceptions, commercial samples can still enter the country duty-free\u2013so long as the items are extremely low value and are either marked as a sample, or are severely damaged to a point that the item cannot be resold. Samples cannot have a value worth more than a single U.S. dollar. If their value is in excess of that, then they must be damaged to the point where it\u2019s clear that they can\u2019t be resold.\n\nBut simply marking a shipment as \u201cnot for sale\u201d or \u201csample,\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically make it duty-free, says Flexport\u2019s Hart. In order for a sample to truly be duty-free, it must qualify under what\u2019s known as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), which spells out tariff rates for different merchandise. More red tape is in store for businesses importing samples into the country as well. \u201c[Businesses] need to understand and follow a process where they\u2019re gathering much more documentation and information than they\u2019ve ever had to before,\u201d says Flexport\u2019s Hart.\n\nCompanies could previously send samples via de minimis shipments, which didn\u2019t require much information, according to Janet Labuda, the head of trade and customs issues at Maersk, the global shipping and logistics company. Such shipments only needed to offer a description, the overall shipment\u2019s value, and the country of origin. One likely option businesses might turn to for entering low-dollar shipments is through informal entry, Labuda says, used for goods valued at less than $2,500. Doing so requires more data, including the importer\u2019s name and address, an HTS number, carrier information, and some other information. But informal entry is still more streamlined compared to formal entry, which would require a broker and \u201cquite a bit of data,\u201d from the importer, Labuda adds. Another option for businesses bringing samples into the country could be through a temporary importation bond, which allows an importer to skirt duties, so long as they agree to bring in goods into the country temporarily, and exit the country with those same goods. One example of where this approach makes sense, Labuda says, could be during a trade show.\n\n\u201cImporters are going to come in and they\u2019re going to have buyers come to the trade show and they\u2019re going to show their wares,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut in three days, they are leaving the country and taking all these samples. So they didn\u2019t pay duty coming in and they left with the product.\u201d Another tactic would be the use of carnets, a specific type of customs document allowing goods to be temporarily imported into the country for up to a one-year period. That\u2019s also duty-free. Based on the continuous revamping of trade policies, importers should not assume that they can bring samples automatically into the U.S. without a duty. That\u2019s according to James Edge, the CEO of Crossborder Global, a logistics company.",
