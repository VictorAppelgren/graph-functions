  "description": "The biggest news stories this morning:   \nESPN\u2019s new streaming service arrives August 21, Grok\u2019s image and video generator now has an NSFW \u2018spicy\u2019 mode, Google says AI in Search is driving more queries and higher quality clicks.",
  "content": "Meta previewed some of its latest virtual reality prototypes this week and plans to demo them at next week\u2019s SIGGRAPH conference. The aim, according to Meta\u2019s blog post, is to offer VR experiences \u201cindistinguishable from the physical world\u201d \u2014 something it says no present-day VR system has yet done. It wants to surpass what it terms the visual Turing test.\n\n\u201cOur mission for this project was to provide the best image quality possible,\u201d said Xuan Wang, an optical research scientist with Reality Labs Research\u2019s Optics, Photonics and Light Systems (OPALS) team.\n\nAnd Meta\u2019s Tiramisu project seemingly has the numbers to back up those ambitions. It promises three times the contrast, 14 times the maximum brightness and 3.6 times the angular resolution of the Meta Quest 3. The headset offers 1,400 nits of brightness and an angular resolution of 90 pixels per degree.\n\nIt\u2019s a work in progress, however. Tiramisu has a field of view of just 33 degrees by 33 degrees compared to the 110 degrees horizontal and 96 degrees vertical FOV in the Meta Quest 3. It also looks like Google\u2019s Daydream, from back in the day.\n\nConversely, another pair of prototypes, codenamed Boba 3, leans into an ultrawide field of view. It has a 180-degree FOV, when human vision extends to around 200 degrees. Also, they\u2019re roughly the same size as current VR headsets.\n\nGet Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!\n\nThe news you might have missed\n\u2022 None Dell Premium 14 review: New name, same great laptop\n\u2022 None Grok\u2019s image and video generator now has an NSFW \u2018spicy\u2019 mode\n\nGoogle says AI in Search is driving more queries and higher quality clicks\n\nEveryone else says differently.\n\nA Pew Research Center report last month shed light on Google\u2019s AI Overviews\u2019 effect on web publishing, showing an abysmal outlook for anyone relying on web traffic. But this week, Google Search head Liz Reid penned a blog post that puts quite a different spin on things. Naturally, she claims click quality and Google Search\u2019s total organic click volume to websites has been \u201crelatively stable\u201d year over year. Reid also said Google sends more \u201cquality clicks\u201d (visitors who don\u2019t quickly bounce) to websites than a year ago.\n\nShe shared no numbers, however.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 is here, and it\u2019s free for everyone\n\nIt\u2019s safer, faster and more accurate than OpenAI\u2019s past models.\n\nOpenAI is releasing the long-awaited GPT-5 and says it has across-the-board enhancements. The company claims the model is its best yet for coding, writing, safety, accuracy and more. At the start of the year, Altman said GPT-5 would offer a unified experience for users, and the new model delivers on that promise.\n\nFor the first time, OpenAI\u2019s default offering is a reasoning model, meaning the system is programmed to tackle complex problems by breaking them into smaller parts. Previously, if you wanted to force ChatGPT to use one of OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models, you had to select the Think Longer option from the prompt bar. This meant most free users didn\u2019t even know OpenAI had more capable models.\n\nPowerful, but not for everyone.\n\nFramework\u2019s 2025 edition of its Desktop PC is powerful, particularly for creative professionals and developers. It uses an AMD Ryzen AI Max APU, which is a workstation-level chip, but to integrate it, the CPU and RAM are soldered directly to the mainboard, making them non-upgradable. The DIY Edition of the Desktop fortunately requires minimal setup, but this isn\u2019t the easy-to-make gaming PC you might be hoping for: It\u2019s better suited to productivity tasks, like running AI models and video editing.\n\nThe most fun Switch 2 accessory is on sale\n\nIf you\u2019re going to get a webcam, make it a Pirhana Plant.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a Switch 2 but haven\u2019t yet dived into the camera functionality, here\u2019s a good reason to. HORI\u2019s Piranha Plant camera is on sale right now for only $40. That\u2019s $20 off and a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2\u2019s camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World. It even comes with a plant pot stand if you want to use it not directly plugged into the Switch 2.",

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nFramework Desktop (2025) Review: Powerful, but perhaps not for everyone\nIt\u2019s a powerhouse for creative professionals and developers.\nThe most obvious question is \u201cWhy?\u201d\nFramework builds modular, repairable laptops that anyone can take apart and put back together again. It\u2019s a big deal in an era where laptops are regularly sold as a single unit that, should one part break, goes in the trash. Since every part of a Framework machine can be swapped out, you can keep one going for as long as your patience, and the supply of spare parts, allows. Desktops, however, are already modular and repairable \u2014 company founder Nirav Patel said \u201cdesktop PC ethos was one of the core inspirations for the Framework laptop to begin with.\u201d So, if desktops are already modular and repairable, why do we need one from Framework?\nWhen the Desktop was announced, Patel said the genesis of the product came from seeing a preview of AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI Max. It\u2019s an APU (Accelerated Processing Unit) \u2014 AMD\u2019s term for a chip combining a CPU, GPU and NPU in a single package, much like Apple Silicon \u2014 with plenty of hyped-up claims about its performance. Those claims were so compelling that Patel added the Desktop to the company\u2019s roadmap just to harness that potential power. The big selling point for this chip is the sheer volume of RAM you can employ (up to 128GB) and the massive memory bandwidth (up to 265GB/s) it can take advantage of. AMD described it as a \u201cworkstation-level\u201d chip that\u2019ll work in a regular \u2018ol PC, with the base model priced at $1,099.\nBut there\u2019s a devil\u2019s bargain in opting for such a powerful chip, since to get it means Framework has had to give up a lot of its founding principles. As someone probably once wrote, for what shall it profit a computer manufacturer if it shall gain searing power but lose its own soul?\nFramework\u2019s first desktop is powerful and efficient. But it\u2019s not as modular, or repairable as a regular PC.\n- Powerful APU.\n- Small and efficient.\n- Easy to set up and use.\n- Compatible with other Mini-ITX cases.\n- APU and RAM are soldered to the mainboard.\n- No repairability.\nHardware\nThe major issue with the Ryzen AI Max is its inflexibility since it\u2019s made as a single package. Much like Apple Silicon products, you\u2019ll need to pick your chip spec in the knowledge that you don\u2019t get to change things later. Consequently, you\u2019ll be ordering the Framework Desktop in one of three unchangeable flavors:\nRyzen AI Max 385 with 32GB RAM, Radeon 8050S GPU\nRyzen AI Max+ 395 with 64GB RAM, Radeon 8060S GPU (the model I\u2019m testing).\nRyzen AI Max+ 395 with 128GB RAM, Radeon 8060S GPU\nWith every other Framework machine, the mainboard has the CPU and fan soldered in place, but that\u2019s it. Every other component can more or less be removed and reinstalled on the replacement mainboard. Here, if that APU goes or if your needs do evolve, then you\u2019re losing pretty much everything (including the heatsink) since it\u2019s all soldered to the mainboard. We'll get into pricing considerations later, but replacement mainboards from Framework run between $799 and $1,699. Otherwise, the only things you can recover here are the Wi-Fi module, SSD (there\u2019s space for two), power supply and case.\nSpeaking of which, the Framework Desktop is a Mini-ITX desktop in a 4.5L case, complete with optional carrying handle. It\u2019s less understated than the cases you\u2019d have seen at a LAN party circa 2006, but that\u2019s not the point. While the box itself is a stark black, you can add a big chunk of personality to it with the front panel, which has space for 21 plastic tiles. These tiles come in a variety of colors (including black, green, orange and lavender) for you to mosaic to your heart\u2019s content. You can also pick up single tiles with specific images printed on, including the Framework, AMD and Linux logos, plus this fetching pride heart. Naturally, if you\u2019re crafty, you can also make your own.\nBelow the front panel and irritatingly small power button, you\u2019ll find two of Framework\u2019s trademark expansion card slots. These are USB-C ducts into which you can slot any of the company\u2019s expansion cards, letting you pick and choose what I/O you have up front. But the flexibility, so necessary on a laptop, is less of an issue here since this is a Mini-ITX mainboard. Lean over to the back and you\u2019ll find two USB-C, two DisplayPorts, two USB-A sockets as well as dedicated connections for HDMI, Ethernet and 3.5mm audio.\nInstallation\nFramework is only selling its desktop in a \u201cDIY Edition,\u201d but that\u2019s less of a big deal than you might initially expect. Whereas the company\u2019s DIY laptops require you to put every component in the chassis, on the Desktop there\u2019s very little to do at all. Everything bar the SSD is already in place, and all you need to do to add that is remove the heatsink and slot your drive into the M.2 slot. After that, you just need to attach the beefy 120mm fan to the equally beefy heatsink, pop the cowl on top and screw in the four screws. Framework\u2019s wonderful iFixit-style guides claimed getting the hardware together would take between 30 and 45 minutes. I hit stop on the watch after 15 minutes and 15 seconds, and can\u2019t imagine many folks will take much more time than that to put everything together. From there, you just need to install your operating system of choice and you\u2019re ready to go.\nIn use\nWith the Desktop, Framework is targeting two groups: gamers, and developers eager to use AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI Max. The pitch to the former group could easily be boiled down to \u2018this is a fast PC you don\u2019t need to do much to build.\u2019 That\u2019s an easy enough metric to judge it by, since we can just run some games on it and see how well it performs. I\u2019ll admit that I am not an AI developer, and so can\u2019t speak as authoritatively on the latter or how effective it would be at running large models if you \u2014 as the company expects \u2014 buy several mainboards to run in a cluster.\nI basically ran every title in my admittedly limited game library with the settings dialed up to max, and it didn\u2019t break a sweat. AMD claims the Radeon 8060S GPU inside my machine goes toe-to-toe with an RTX 4070 laptop GPU. This is a ten pound hammer for the one ounce nail that is Fortnite, but even demanding titles like Hardspace: Shipbreaker breezed through. My gut tells me, however, that people wouldn\u2019t be eyeing this up as a primary gaming machine. That\u2019s not where this unit\u2019s power lies, really, but in the more work-y tasks that better suit the APU.\nAs I said, I\u2019m not an AI developer but I did mess around with LM Studio, which I tested with a chatbot running Google\u2019s Gemma 3 27B model. Performance was a little slower than you may see on a web-based AI client, but not enough for it to be an issue. LM Studio, too, suggested that running this was only taking around a third of the Desktop\u2019s CPU power, so there\u2019s probably plenty more headroom there to run bigger and more demanding models.\nI am, however, on surer footing with big workstation tasks, like video editing and exporting, and I was impressed with the results here. For this, I took a 39GB HD video file with a runtime of 2 hours, made a few minor trims, and then compressed and exported it as an MP4 file. Crunching the file down to 6GB took just one hour and 12 minutes, a staggering speed boost for a job that could take half a day to export on lesser hardware. It\u2019s worth remembering, too, that I\u2019m testing the middle-tier version of the Desktop with 64GB RAM.\nWhen announcing the Desktop, Patel said the machine would run quietly even at peak power. He described it as \u201csilent while sitting on your desktop under normal loads, and even under gaming, it\u2019s impressively quiet.\u201d If you\u2019re familiar with Framework\u2019s track record and products so far, that quote will have instantly provoked scoffing. The company does many things well, but it wildly overpromises on how quiet and cool its machines run.\nFramework trumpeted how much better its cooling was on its recently-released Ryzen AI 300 mainboard for the Laptop 13, which was noisy and lap roasting. Here, you\u2019ve got a beefy APU expected to run for sustained periods of time at 120W and up to 140W in boost. I half expected to be able to use this thing as a space heater but, mercifully, the company does seem to have made good on its promises. The 120mm fan barely got noisy at all, and I can only recall it becoming noticeable when running heavier AI models in LM Studio and when I started exporting the video file.\nPricing\nThe starting price for the base model Desktop with the Max 385 and 32GB of RAM is $1,099. For that, you\u2019ll get the case, power supply and mainboard, which includes its own Wi-Fi module. What the company is listing as optional extras, however, includes the SSD, CPU fan, OS and even the power lead. So, if you were looking to buy the base model as an essentially off the shelf purchase, including decorative tiles and two front-facing expansion cards, the price rises to $1,386. If you want to opt for the mid-tier option (the 395 with 64GB RAM) add $500 to the base model price. If you want to go for the high end 395 with 128GB RAM, then you\u2019ll be adding $900 to the base price, bringing the total for an off-the-shelf model to around $2,286.\nBecause of the distinct nature of the Ryzen AI Max, an apples-to-apples comparison isn\u2019t going to be perfect. But, if you were looking to spend around two grand on a high-performance PC, you could snag something like Lenovo\u2019s Legion Tower 5 with AMD. $2,200 buys you a Ryzen 7 with 16GB DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD and NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 4070 Ti with 12GB RAM. Alternatively, that figure could get you an ASUS ROG G700 with a Ryzen 7, Radeon RX 9070 XT Prime (with 16GB VRAM), 16GB RAM and a 2TB SSD. The real differentiator is how much you would value the faster memory bandwidth and speed the AI Max offers over its discrete rivals.\nFramework will also sell users the Desktop\u2019s mainboard on its own, with the base model priced at $799. Certainly, if you\u2019ve got boxes full of spare parts and the necessary Mini-ITX case, you could save a chunk of change that way. This will also be the most cost effective way for power users to run clusters of boards for bigger projects. Pre-orders are open, but the company won\u2019t start shipping boards on their own until it\u2019s fulfilled all of its system orders.\nWrap-up\nIn my time with the Framework Desktop, I\u2019ve flip-flopped a few times on if this product is a hit or a miss. Framework was open about the fact this was something akin to a side project, outside its regular remit to build modular laptops, based on a particularly exciting chip. So while I think the all-in-one approach is a backward step compared to regular PCs, I get the rationale for doing so here.\nWhere I think Framework whiffed was to pitch this as a machine to make \u201cPC gaming more accessible\u201d by reducing \u201cthe mental and physical load\u201d associated with building your own. Nightmares about thermal paste aside, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real issue for would-be gamers as they could easily pick up a pre-built system for similar cash. And I suspect most gamers would much rather use a PC with a standalone graphics card rather than slum it with an integrated GPU.\nBecause even mentioning gaming, really, does the machine a massive disservice, pulling the focus from its real strength. Which is the ease at which this machine handled productivity tasks, like running AI models and crunching video. The effortlessness at which it handled that brought to mind products like the Mac Studio, a creative powerhouse in its own tiny package. It\u2019s this that Framework should have led with, especially since it\u2019ll do all of those tasks and play games on the side.\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend this product to people who are just looking to buy a powerful PC or a gaming PC. It\u2019s a tool for a specific group of users capable of taking advantage of the AI Max\u2019s benefits that you\u2019d otherwise need a workstation for. So while its review score is justifiably high when the Framework Desktop is judged on its own merits, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to own one."

One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim.\nThis was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today.\nThis is 33 percent off and a record-low price.\nThis thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.\nThere's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice."

      "text": "Video Games Weekly: Censorship and stolen puritanical valor\nThe gaming news you need, July 28 to August 5.\nWelcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy \u2014 and I'll see you next week.\nLet\u2019s all agree to stop talking about that awful conservative activist group out of Australia. You know the one \u2014 like a parasite, it attached itself to the censorship campaign that erased thousands of adult games from Steam and Itch.io, and successfully positioned itself at the center of the delisting narrative. However, logic and evidence suggests this group had very little to do with the mass removals.\nThis Australian anti-porn organization led a movement in April to remove the edgelord simulator No Mercy from Steam, and since everyone agreed that game sucked, the campaign worked and the title disappeared from the storefront. This is where I believe the organization\u2019s involvement in the current drama ends.\nIt seems No Mercy spurred payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal to turn their attention to the PC gaming market (an irony that I would find funnier if it weren\u2019t actively eroding an industry I love). These institutions took the opportunity to dictate the types of games they would support, and in response on July 16, Steam added a clause to its ruleset banning content that \"may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam\u2019s payment processors,\" including \u201ccertain kinds of adult only content.\u201d Censorship on Steam is not new; Valve has for years had rules banning mislabeled adult content, hate speech, anything violating local laws and many other regulations. But outsourcing censorship to payment processors is new, and hundreds of games were removed from the platform following the rule change. On July 24, Itch.io rolled out its own changes and summarily de-indexed every adult and NSFW game it hosted, which amounted to roughly 20,000 titles being hidden from search and browse pages.\nThe conservative Australian group claimed responsibility for the Steam bans on July 19, three days after the platform\u2019s rule change went live. The organization said the censorship was the direct result of two of its recent efforts: an email campaign that sent 1,067 messages to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and others claiming Steam and Itch.io were hosting illegal sexual content, and an open letter addressed to the same financial institutions, signed by faith-based, anti-sex work and anti-queer activist groups.\nThere is no evidence that these campaigns were directly responsible for payment processors\u2019 renewed enforcements. It\u2019s actually ludicrous to suggest that roughly 1,000 emails or an open letter would even register at companies the size of Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. What\u2019s more, after taking credit for the removal of hundreds of Steam games, the Australian group has attempted to distance itself from the whole shebang. Following intense scrutiny from players, industry watchdogs and media outlets, every group in this situation is trying to avoid accountability, in fact. Valve says Mastercard made this happen, while Mastercard says it\u2019s just following the law, and PayPal says it\u2019s simply doing what companies like Mastercard tell it to do. Meanwhile, the Australian group is trying to avoid blame for the sweeping Itch.io delistings while simultaneously attempting to exploit the Steam bans and gain momentum for its conservative bullshit.\nIn the most likely scenario, the Australian activist group saw these PC gaming audits coming and, in a strange act of stolen puritanical valor, took steps to center itself in the conversation. We can stop helping it do so. Forget its name and, as the IGDA suggests, direct your ire toward the organizations with power in this situation, namely Mastercard and Visa.\nStill. It\u2019s notable that an organization backed by conservative Christian groups that loudly oppose sex work, queer rights and freedom of expression was able to so cleanly align itself with financial companies censoring content on Steam and Itch.io. This uncontested endorsement is especially worrisome in a political and social climate where women, the queer community, people of color and those who don\u2019t conform to a traditional conservative lifestyle are under attack. At a time like this, subversive and raw art is more necessary than ever, but it\u2019s also in its most vulnerable position. Choosing this moment to activate a censorship campaign is not only dangerous for our most vulnerable communities, it\u2019s cowardly.\nThere\u2019s been some additional misinformation wrapped up in this censorship mess, of course. Three games were incorrectly reported as delisted or removed from Itch.io or Steam as part of this situation: Mouthwashing, Trials of Innocence and Console Me. One game that was unjustly removed during the chaos was the psychological horror game VILE: Exhumed \u2014 read my interview with creator Cara Cadaver right here.\nThe news\nBioShock 4 enters a new circle of development hell\nIn most contexts, I\u2019d be pretty stoked on the thought of a hell-based BioShock, but this is the worst possible iteration of that idea. According to Bloomberg, BioShock 4 failed a recent review with executives at its publisher, 2K Games, and it\u2019s heading back to developers at Cloud Chamber for a narrative revamp. Plus, Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore is gone and creative director Hogarth de la Plante was moved to a publishing role. Not much is known about the game that\u2019s assumed to be BioShock 4, but it was revealed in 2019 alongside the formation of Cloud Chamber, so it\u2019s already been in development for quite a while.\nIn related Rapture news, 2K\u2019s remake of the original BioShock was canceled earlier this year, Bloomberg reports. Ken Levine, the creator of the BioShock series, is currently working on a familiar-looking FPS called Judas at his own studio, Ghost Story Games.\nGOG gave away millions of games to protest censorship\nGOG partnered with developers to release 13 games with adult themes for free from August 1 to 3, in protest of all the censorship going down on Steam and Itch.io. None of the free titles were specifically banned in the censorship campaign, but they featured sexual, queer or violent content that could easily be targeted by similar efforts. GOG handed out its free games to more than 1 million players.\nItch.io is reindexing free NSFW games\nAfter deindexing all of its adult games on July 24 \u2014 like, all of them \u2014 Itch.io on August 1 relisted all free games in this category. Itch.io is currently auditing thousands of adult and NSFW games that it swept up in the payment processor ban, and it\u2019s unclear how the platform will support titles with these themes going forward. One of Itch.io\u2019s longstanding partners, Stripe, said it will no longer facilitate transactions of titles \"designed for sexual gratification,\" but there\u2019s apparently room for negotiation in the future.\nBattlefield 6 will land on October 10\nIn a shocking twist, EA also revealed that Battlefield 6 will have multiplayer content.\nAge verification is coming to an Xbox near you\nThe video game world is feeling the effects of the UK's Online Safety Act. Platforms including Discord and Xbox are implementing new age-verification methods to comply with the law in the UK, and Microsoft is planning to expand its program to other regions. It's in no rush, though, saying it'll use the UK as a guinea pig for these systems first, and then implement what it learns across the globe.\nSony is suing Tencent over its blatant Horizon clone\nAt its unveiling in 2024, viewers instantly called out Polaris Quest\u2019s Light of Motiram for looking an awful lot like Guerrilla Games' Horizon series \u2014 our headline called it a \"pretty blatant Horizon ripoff,\" even. It took the better part of a year, but PlayStation's lawyers have finally kicked into gear. Sony is now suing Tencent, which owns Polaris Quest, over what it calls a \"slavish clone\" of its IP.\nRaven finally has a union contract with Microsoft\nRecent layoffs at Microsoft have only heightened the importance of proper labor organizing in video games, and one of the industry\u2019s first unions is finally making things official. Three years after initiating the process, Call of Duty support studio Raven Software has ratified its union contract with Microsoft. Raven Software initially voted to organize under Activision Blizzard, but after Microsoft completed its acquisition of the studio in October 2023, it continued negotiations with the tech titan.\nPlay VILE: Exhumed, the game that Steam doesn't want you to see\nAfter VILE: Exhumed was removed and permanently banned from Steam for reasons that don't actually apply to the game, developer Cara Cadaver and publisher DreadXP have rolled out their own distribution model, and prices start at $0. You can download and play the game right now for free, and there's an option to throw some money Cara's way. A portion of the profits will benefit the Toronto-based charity Red Door Family Shelter.\nAdditional reading\nHave a tip for Jessica?

The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones it announced today don't support the platform, and it won't sell Daydream View headsets anymore. The Daydream app and store will still work for people with other Pixel devices, however.\n\"[There hasn't] been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped, and we've seen decreasing usage over time of the Daydream View headset,\" a Google spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. \"So while we are no longer selling Daydream View or supporting Daydream on Pixel 4, the Daydream app and store will remain available for existing users.\"\nGoogle cited \"clear limitations constraining smartphone VR from being a viable long-term solution.\" Namely, when people dropped their phones into headsets, that prevented them from using other apps. The company plans to continue working on augmented reality with features such as AR walking directions in Maps, AR experiences in Search and Google Lens.\nThe writing's been on the wall for Google's smartphone VR ambitions for a while. The Pixel 3a and 3a XL Google released earlier this year don't work with Daydream either. Hulu dropped support for Daydream VR last month and earlier this year, Google shut down its Spotlight Stories VR studio and Daydream's Play Movies and TV app. It also wound down the Jump VR platform in June.\nHere's Google's full statement:\nWe saw a lot of potential in smartphone VR\u2014being able to use the smartphone you carry with you everywhere to power an immersive on-the-go experience. But over time we noticed some clear limitations constraining smartphone VR from being a viable long-term solution. Most notably, asking people to put their phone in a headset and lose access to the apps they use throughout the day causes immense friction.\nThere also hasn't been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped, and we've seen decreasing usage over time of the Daydream View headset. So while we are no longer selling Daydream View or supporting Daydream on Pixel 4, the Daydream app and store will remain available for existing users.\nWe're investing heavily in helpful AR experiences like Google Lens, AR walking navigation in Maps, and AR in Search that use the smartphone camera to bridge the digital and physical worlds, helping people do more with what they see and learn about the world around them."

      "text": "Google: Actually, AI in Search is driving more queries and higher quality clicks\nThe company's spin clashes with third-party reports.\nLast month, a Pew Research Center report shed light on Google's AI Overviews' effect on web publishing. In short, the analysis painted an abysmal outlook for anyone relying on web traffic. But on Wednesday, Google Search head Liz Reid penned a blog post that puts quite a different spin on things. The Google VP claims traffic from search to websites is \"relatively stable\" and that click quality has increased.\nReid's framing boils down to everything is peachy, and AI is making things better \u2014 even for websites! She wrote that Google Search's total organic click volume to websites has been \"relatively\" stable year-over-year. Reid also claimed Google sends more \"quality clicks\" (visitors who don't quickly bounce) to websites than a year ago. The company says people are also happier with the search experience.\nThe company didn't share any numbers \u2014 the post has no data whatsoever \u2014 to support its claims.\nGoogle's explanation for the rosy outlook? \"With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex,\" Reid wrote. \"In addition, with AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.\"\nReid does highlight a shifting landscape. She says user trends are resulting in lower traffic for some sites and increased traffic for others. Of course, the Google Search head didn't call out any specific websites. But she claims forums, videos, podcasts and posts with \"authentic voices and first-hand perspectives\" are thriving. Reid added that content like \"an in-depth review, an original post, a unique perspective, or a thoughtful first-person analysis\" does well.\nThe Google VP said people seeking simple Q&A types of searches are leaning more on AI. \"For some questions where people are looking for a quick answer, like 'when is the next full moon,' people may be satisfied with the initial AI Overviews response and not click further,\" Reid wrote. \"This has also been true for other answer features we've added, like the Knowledge Graph or sports scores. But for many other types of questions, people continue to click through, as they want to dig deeper into a topic, explore further or make a purchase. This is why we see click quality increasing \u2014 an AI response might provide the lay of the land, but people click to dive deeper and learn more, and when they do, these clicks are more valuable.\"\nIt's quite the contrast from the Pew report. It found that visitors who saw an AI summary clicked a traditional search result in eight percent of all visits. Those without an AI summary? They clicked on a traditional result in 15 percent of their visits. As for actually clicking the source links in AI summaries? Pew's study found that one percent of Google searches that included AI summaries resulted in a user clicking on those source links. Users were also more likely to end their browsing after visiting a page with an AI summary.\nThat aligned with comments Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince made in June. He said search traffic referrals keep plummeting. \"The future of the web is going to be more and more like AI, and that means that people are going to be reading the summaries of your content, not the original content,\" he said. Prince said that a decade ago, Google sent a publisher one visitor for every two pages it crawled. Early this year, it dropped to one visitor for every six pages. He said that, in June, it was down to one for every 18.\nI can't tell you who to believe. But here's what the ultimate source had to say:\nCorrection, August 7, 2025, 2:55PM ET: This article has been updated to note that Pew's study found one percent of Google searches with AI summaries had someone click on a source link in those summaries. It previously stated that one percent of search users clicked on those source links."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nDell Premium 14 review: New name, same great laptop\nIt may not be an XPS anymore, but it's still just as good.\nEvery now and then companies make truly boneheaded decisions, which is exactly what happened when Dell killed off the name of its most iconic PC line and replaced it with something generic. It's like if Ford decided to rebrand Mustang and call it The Prime Sportscar instead. It doesn't make sense. But now that XPS has become Premium, it's time to see if Dell's latest flagship 14-inch ultraportable \u2014 the Dell 14 Premium (you see how dumb that sounds?) \u2014 still has the DNA that made its predecessors one of the best notebook families for more than a decade.\nDesign and display: How Dell puts the P in Premium\nInstead of doing a full redesign to match its updated name, for 2025 Dell kept the same chassis it used on last year's XPS 14. And I'm not mad at all because it's still one of the most beautiful and elegant notebooks on the market today. Its aluminum chassis has clean lines, a Gorilla Glass 3 surface and just the right amount of ports for a laptop this size: three USB-C slots with Thunderbolt 4, a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD slot. That's important, because the 14 Premium's smaller sibling \u2014 the XPS 13 (which isn\u2019t being renamed yet because it isn't getting updated this year) \u2014 doesn't have a headphone jack or a built-in card reader. That said, at between 3.66 and 3.79 pounds depending on which display you pick, the 14 Premium is a touch heavier than some of its similarly-sized rivals like a 14-inch MacBook Pro (3.4 pounds). The difference is small enough that I'm not bothered, though.\nWhile Dell rebranded the XPS 14 with a new and frankly worse name, it's still every bit the world-class Windows laptop that its predecessors were.\n- Sleek design\n- Vivid optional OLED display\n- Solid performance\n- Giant touchpad\n- Divisive capacitive touch buttons\n- Optional discrete GPU is one generation old\nThere's also a glass wrist rest with a touchpad that blends invisibly into the deck, which might make it seem potentially hard to use. However, because the tracking area is absolutely massive (it spans the entire area below the spacebar plus the right ALT and Copilot keys), I never felt cramped or like I needed to actively search for my cursor. I also appreciate how Dell found room for speakers on either side of the keyboard.\nOn the other hand, Dell's touch buttons above the number row may be a bit more contentious. I don't mind the ones for adjusting volume and display brightness, but replacing the physical keys for Escape and Delete with the touchscreen options just feels a bit weird. Especially if you ever need to use the classic Windows CTRL + ALT + DEL shortcut and have to press regular keys and touch controls in a single motion. The touch keys also don't turn off when you disable the keyboard's backlight, but at least they're dim enough that they're not distracting.\nAs for its display, by default the 14 Premium comes with a 14.5-inch 2K 120Hz non-touch IPS display. However, on our review unit, I've been using Dell's optional 3.2K 120Hz touch OLED panel and I must say, it's definitely worth the $200 upcharge. That's because while the OLED screen has slightly lower max brightness (400 nits versus 500 nits for the IPS), its wider color gamut and improved contrast ratio more than make up for that shortcoming.\nPerformance: Not the most up-to-date, but still very versatile\nA base Dell 14 Premium comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of M.2 storage. However, our review unit includes extra memory (32GB), a bigger SSD (1TB) and perhaps most importantly, an optional NVIDIA RTX 4050 GPU.\nAll told, that's a pretty well-rounded package, as Dell's default config has more than enough performance to handle pretty much any level of regular productivity. And by adding in support for discrete graphics, suddenly you have a machine that's significantly better equipped to take care of more demanding tasks like video editing or even gaming in your off hours. Granted, the 14 Premium's RTX 4050 card is an entry-level component that recently became a generation old, but it was strong enough to hit 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p on high settings (with DLSS set to balanced), which ain't too shabby considering its portability.\nBattery life: Good enough\nThe Dell 14 Premium packs good but not outstanding battery life thanks to its 69.5WHr power pack. On PCMark10's Modern Office rundown test, it lasted 8 hours and 30 minutes on the dot That\u2019s significantly longer than ASUS' ROG Z Flow 13 (6:54) and last year's Razer Blade 14 (6:46), but still a far cry from true power-sipping systems like the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED (12:43) or even Dell's own XPS 13 (13:15).\nWrap-up\nEven with a new and rather uninspired name, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the Dell 14 Premium remains one of the best Windows laptops on the market. It has the same sleek design from back when it was still called the XPS 14 but with some refreshed specs and components for 2025. Its chassis strikes a brilliant balance between modern minimalism and usability, while upgrades like its OLED display and discrete graphics give you the ability to build out a versatile but still very portable device.\nNow I admit that our fully loaded review unit is a bit pricey with a retail price of $2,450, though I'd be remiss to mention that Dell is currently running a sale that knocks $200 off that cost. Regardless, with the base model starting at $1,650 (before discounts) or $1,850 when paired with Dell's optional OLED panel (which everyone should at least consider), the 14 Premium still feels like a great deal. And when you consider that the XPS 13 isn't getting any updates this year on top of having fewer ports, the choice becomes even clearer. If I were going to spend my own money on a traditional Windows ultraportable laptop, this is the laptop I'd get."

      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/gpt-5-is-here-and-its-free-for-everyone-170001066.html",
      "text": "GPT-5 is here and it's free for everyone\nIt's safer, faster and more accurate than OpenAI's past models.\nA couple of days after announcing its first open-weight models in six years, OpenAI is releasing the long-awaited GPT-5. What's more, you can start using it today, even if you're a free user. With GPT-5, the company is touting across-the-board enhancements, claiming the model is its best yet when it comes to coding, writing, safety, accuracy and more.\n\"GPT-5 is the first time that it really feels like you're talking to an expert in any topic,\" said OpenAI CEO (and hypeman) Sam Altman during a press briefing the company held before today's announcement. \"It reminds me of when the iPhone went from those giant, old pixel [screens] to the Retina Display, and then I went back to using one of those big pixelated things and I was like, 'Wow, I can't believe how bad we had it.'\"\nAt the start of the year, Altman said GPT-5 would offer a unified experience for users, and the new model delivers on that promise. For the first time, OpenAI's default offering is a reasoning model, meaning the system is programmed to tackle complex problems by breaking them into smaller parts. Previously, if you wanted to force ChatGPT to use one of OpenAI's reasoning models, you had to select the \"Think Longer\" option from the prompt bar. This meant most free users didn't even know OpenAI had more capable models. With GPT-5, the company has significantly simplified the ChatGPT experience.\nOn the consumer side of things, there are only three versions of the new model. One of those \u2014 GPT-5 mini \u2014 only crops up when free and Plus users run into their regular GPT-5 usage limit. The other variant, GPT-5 Pro, is, as the name suggests, only available to subscribers of the company's $200 per month Pro plan. On the subject of query limits, Plus users can use GPT-5 \"significantly\" more than those with a free account, while Pro customers can chat with GPT-5 as much as they want.\nWhen it comes to reasoning, GPT-5 is much faster than o3, OpenAI's previous state-of-the-art AI. \"It's so fast that I've had the psychological experience of wondering, like, is it really thinking enough? And then it gives a great answer,\" said Altman. Perhaps more importantly, it suffers from fewer hallucinations, with OpenAI claiming the model delivers more accurate answers than any of its previous reasoning systems. For instance, when thinking, GPT-5 is approximately 80 percent less likely to include a factual error in its answer than o3. We'll see how GPT-5 responds in real-world use, but if OpenAI has made meaningful improvements here, it would be a big deal; hallucinations have typically been a major weakness of reasoning models, particularly relative to traditional large language counterparts.\nAt the same time, OpenAI says GPT-5 is its safest AI to date. For one, it includes a new feature called Safe Completions. \"In the past, we've approached this from a sort of a binary, if we thought that the prompt was safe, we would comply. If we thought it was unsafe, the model would refuse,\" said Alex Beutel, safety research lead at OpenAI. \"This worked well, but as a challenge that there can be kind of carefully worded prompts that could be confusing. So if someone says how much energy is needed to ignite some specific material that could be an adversary trying to get around the safety protections and cause harm, or it could be a student asking a science question to understand the physics of this material.\"\nWith Safe Completions, GPT-5 will try to give the most helpful answer within the safety constraints OpenAI has imposed on it. In tricky situations like the one Beutel outlined above, the model will only provide high-level information that can't be used to harm anyone. \"On average, the system is both safer and more helpful for users, and we think that'll be much better,\" Beutel added.\nAdditionally, when it comes to health-related questions, GPT-5 is better at flagging concerns and suggesting questions the user should ask of their healthcare provider. It will also answer those prompts more precisely, thanks to the ability to adapt to the person's knowledge level and geography.\nOn top of everything else, OpenAI says GPT-5 is its best model for coding yet. It's supposedly a better writer too, with the company promising the chatbot is better at translating your drafts into \"compelling, resonant\" copy.\nAlongside GPT-5, OpenAI is adding a handful of new features to ChatGPT. To start, users can now choose a color for their chats, with a few exclusive options available for paying customers. OpenAI has also made it easier to connect ChatGPT to Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Contacts. Once you enable the connections, the chatbot will know when to automatically reference your Google accounts; you won't need to select anything before you start chatting. OpenAI will begin rolling out this feature to Pro subscribers starting next week, with availability for other users to follow.\nOver in the Custom Instructions pane, where you can write system prompts to tweak how ChatGPT interacts with you, OpenAI is introducing a handful of pre-set personalities. The four options \u2014 cynic, robot, listener and nerd \u2014 are available as part of a research preview, and can be changed or disabled at any time.\nLast but not least, OpenAI is releasing an updated version of its Advanced Voice feature the company introduced last summer. OpenAI says the tool is better at understanding instructions and adapting its speaking style to the moment. As part of this change, OpenAI is retiring Standard Voice Mode. In practice, that means the company can now offer a better voice experience to everyone since it doesn't need to fall back on Standard Voice Mode, which isn't natively multi-modal like Advanced Voice and therefore worse at understanding the nuances of human speech.\nIf you're wondering where this leaves OpenAI on the path toward artificial general intelligence, Altman had this to say when asked about the topic. \"I kind of hate the term AGI, because everyone at this point uses it to mean a slightly different thing, but [GPT-5] is a significant step forward towards models that are really capable. We're still missing something quite important,\" he said, noting GPT-5 can't continuously learn on its own. \"But the level of intelligence here, the level of capability, it feels like a huge improvement. Certainly, if I could go back five years before GPT-3 and you told me we have this now, I'd be like that's a significant fraction of the way to something very AGI-like.\"\nUpdate 2:00PM: Added more context about hallucination rates."
