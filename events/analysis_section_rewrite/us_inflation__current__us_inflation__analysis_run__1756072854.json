      "feedback": "World-class upgrade: build a crisp 0–3 week causal chain anchored in four pillars—tariff intensity and pass‑through, trade/demand signals, financing costs and consumer credit risk, and monetary-policy signaling—with explicit, sourced numbers and clear catalysts; quantify every assertion from the IDs you have (tariffs rising to >10% of imports and the June trade deficit hitting record pace; exports ~1.01T vs imports ~1.70T and the export ratio stuck around the low-to-mid 20s% in 2025 versus a long-run near‑40%; autos tariffs moving from 27.5% toward 15% with some pass‑through to prices; average new-car loan ~6.43% and ongoing negative-equity risk; and Powell/Lagarde/Jackson Hole dynamics shaping the near‑term policy response) and avoid vague platitudes (0J41Q7KTX; S15934PBQ; CDBMWIUTB; U6HXAJR4J); reconcile conflicting signals on tariff pass‑through by stating both sides (e.g., Nikkei/Nikkei‑style reporting of pass‑through vs seasonal/explanatory claims) and show their implications for near‑term pricing and demand; tighten horizon emphasis by listing immediate catalysts (August trade data releases and tariff announcements; Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks and any Fed‑funds‑futures shifts; Lagarde’s comments on independence as a credibility constraint) and convert them into a specific reaction function (risk‑on if rate‑cut odds firm on data, risk‑off if tariff costs broaden or inflation accelerates); add explicit invalidation levels (e.g., sustained export ratio hover below ~25% and signs of easing inflation despite tariff costs; or a credible shift in Fed pricing that pushes the first cut further out) and deliver a three-scenario view (base, upside, downside) with clear trigger thresholds; include a concise monitoring checklist (August trade print, tariff policy moves, auto pricing trends, consumer credit delinquencies, and central‑bank communications) to guide next steps; drop tangential items (e.g., unrelated tourism data) and ensure every sentence ties back to the 0–3 week focus and the cited sources (0J41Q7KTX; S15934PBQ; CDBMWIUTB; U6HXAJR4J).",
