  "title": "Two years and one Assassin's Creed Shadows later, Ubisoft is giving AC Mirage a \"surprise\" free DLC after saying it was done with the game",
  "description": "Another leap of faith",
  "content": "Now that Assassin's Creed Shadows is in the wild, you'd think Ubisoft would be tunnel visioned into its DLC roadmap. Random as ever, the publisher's instead found the time to squeeze in some \"surprise\" additions into the last, slightly overlooked game in the series: Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year,\" the company announced via a social media post. The free DLC will include a \"new story chapter and missions set in 9th century AlUla,\" an ancient Saudi Arabian city, as well as \"gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location.\" Our only official look at the whole thing is the concept art down below.\n\nWhat makes this all so interesting is that Ubisoft said it had \"no post-launch content\" planned for AC Mirage in April, 2024. \"Mirage [has been designed] as a standalone experience without any [DLC planned],\" narrative director Stephane Boudon said at the time. \"However, we have ideas on how we could extend the story of Basim, surely.\"\n\nWhat changed between then and now? It's hard to tell, but the Mirage DLC was seemingly leaked a few months ago by a Les Echos report which also claimed the new content was born out of a partnership between Ubisoft and Savvy Games Group, a gaming conglomerate formed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, which might explain the game's new location.\n\nFans have been feeding off more Mirage-shaped breadcrumbs, too. Notably, Assassin's Creed Mirage's Basim said he wants to be in Netflix's show, and fans think this could be \"part of a calculated audience warm-up.\"\n\nHere are 10 games like Assassin's Creed to take the leap of faith on",

      "text": "Assassin's Creed has gone a bit off the rails, but Ubisoft says it hasn't forgotten about the whole Assassins versus Templars thing, with a \"deep dive\" on the conflict coming \"in the near future\"\nNow eventually you do plan to have Templars in your Assassins versus Templars game, right?\nThe Assassin's Creed series tends to have a flaky relationship with its own lore, as you can never be quite sure whether theoretical mainstays like modern-day shenanigans or Isu artifacts are going to appear in any given entry. Even the conflict between the Assassins and the Templars was more or less swept under the rug in Assassin's Creed Shadows, but Ubisoft is hinting that may soon change.\n\"The Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of Assassin's Creed,\" a developer identified as Luc says in a Reddit AMA. \"With Shadows, we wanted to properly set our protagonist in the setting before expanding on the Assassins vs. Templars. Now that it's done on the main game, we scratched the surface with the Critical Role story drop, and you can expect more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.\"\nShadows does technically feature a handful of Templars, but the organization is very much in the distant background of the game's main conflict. Luc's comment doesn't make clear when we'll see the return of the full Templar storyline, but the Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap currently only has a single major story DLC release on it \u2013 I'd say that free Claws of Awaji expansion is a pretty safe bet for some Templar action.\nAnd yes, the Critical Role story drop Luc alludes to is indeed canon, though the Dead by Daylight crossover is not. Luc confirms as much in another comment, where the issue of Isu artifacts is also addressed. \"The fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of Shadows doesn't mean that it doesn't exist in the world of Shadows; it just wasn't a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell,\" Luc says.\nWhat about a return to the modern-day storyline? \"While Modern Day is not the main focus of the story we tell with Shadows,\" Luc says in yet another comment, \"it remains important for our community, so you can expect it to be expanded at some point, in some fashion\u2026\"\nOn the topic of both the Templars and the Isu, another dev identified as Simon notes that any specific details \"would be a spoiler,\" but says to \"keep an eye on our future updates \u2013 there might be more deep-lore secrets drops than you imagine\u2026\"\nThat's a whole lot of \"someday\" and \"maybe\" with regards to the central lore of Assassin's Creed, but it does at least sound like we can expect a big check-in with the Templars sooner rather than later. As an unapologetic enthusiast for the series' ancient aliens and bizarre sci-fi plot twists, I hope those \"deep-lore secrets\" are indeed bigger than I imagine.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nHere are all the upcoming Ubisoft games you need to know about.\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

      "text": "Assassin's Creed Shadows developers are focusing on improving \"what we already have,\" but they're adding at least one new open-world activity in post-launch updates\nUbisoft is far from done with Feudal Japan\nAssassin's Creed Shadows might have dropped months ago at this point, but Ubisoft isn't done adding on to and improving the massive romp since some AC developers have teased that an expanded open-world activity is in the works.\nThe Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap is stuffed with incoming features, including a New Game Plus mode, mysterious collaborations, and the promising Claws of Awaji DLC due sometime later this year. But in between those more beefy content drops, the team is working on updates that improve things bit by bit.\nIn a new Reddit AMA, some members of the team teased what we can expect from these smaller, more regular updates still in the pipeline. When asked about potential open-world activities, like new mini-games or random encounters, game producer 'Andre' said there's at least \"one activity we plan to expand in the future.\"\n\"More details to come on this one,\" they added. \"Otherwise, we are not planning many brand-new additions to the open-world activities. Our focus is to work on what we already have got in play.\"\nUbisoft's commitment to improving what's already here probably explains why Discovery Tour, the cool educational mode seen in the series' other RPG mammoths, isn't coming to Shadows.\nStill, it sounds like there are lots of other cool things on the horizon for Assassin's Creed Shadows and the series as a whole. For example, the whole Assassin's versus Templars thing that the stealthy-stabby franchise was built on apparently hasn't been forgotten and will pop back up \"in the near future.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar.

Whether you're after more experiences that will let you put your stealthy skills to use, you enjoy parkouring, or you're looking to get your fill of exploration, we've brought together the best alternatives out there that you can get stuck into right now.\nThe long-running stealth series from Ubisoft has brought us a lot of different adventures set across different periods in history, from the very first games that introduced the hidden blade, to the more recent RPG incarnations, we still have some exciting upcoming Assassin's Creed games to look forward to. After Assassin's Creed Mirage took us to Baghdad in the 9th century, the newly released Assassin's Creed Shadows brings us to Feudal Japan. Next, there are also rumors of an upcoming setting of the 16th-century witch trials in Assassin's Creed Hexe.\nBut while we wait for what looks set to be one of the most exciting new games on the horizon, these games like Assassin's Creed are here to keep you busy. So get ready to take a leap of faith as we guide you through our pick of the 10 best games like Assassin's Creed you can play right now.\n10 Games like Assassin's Creed You Can Play Today\n10. Dishonored 2\nDeveloper: Arkane Studios\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nArkane's Dishonored series will delight stealth-focused Assassin's Creed fans who enjoyed the more focused earlier entries in the series \u2013 where you couldn't just whip out dual scimitars and go to town on enemies. One of the finest modern Immersive Sims, Dishonored 2 is still a revolutionary stealth game with toy box levels designed for critical thinkers and tinkerers.\nWhether you want to set traps, possess foes, or use acrobatics to get around a problem, Dishonored 2 offers you that bandwidth alongside some genius-level design, creating maps full of clever environmental storytelling - spaces begging to be explored. Sure, it's a harsh switch to the first-person perspective, but the stealth ethos of Creed is present here, a style you should be familiar with if you're an old-school stealth game fan. If you find yourself enjoying Assassin's Creed's stealth gameplay, Dishonored doubles down on that fun, and offers an engaging story to boot.\nRead our Dishonored 2 review\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n9. Uncharted 4\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPlatform(s): PS5, PS4, PC\nAssassin's Creed's stealth gameplay has always taken first priority over its story, so perhaps you'd be interested in Uncharted 4, which takes inspiration from Creed's parkour clambering but delivers one of the best modern narratives in video games. A globe-trotting tale following pretend Archaeologist Nathan Drake (who secretly just likes to blow stuff up) as he deals with his most intrepid foe yet - settling down.\nA moving story that melds emotional lows with adrenaline-pumping highs, Uncharted 4 will suit any Assassin's Creed fan who is looking for a little bit more oomph in the story department. It also has an incredibly cool rope-swinging mechanic. Think Tarzan, but with like\u2026 guns and explosives. Do yourself a favor and make sure you play one of the best Uncharted games.\nRead our Uncharted 4 review\n8. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nPlatform(s): Nintendo Switch\nA game that quickly became near and dear to every early adopter's heart when it dropped alongside the Nintendo Switch in early 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an utter masterpiece, a holistic reinvention of Zelda that pushed the series away from the trappings of the past and into the future. It'd be hard to argue it doesn't evoke some of Assassin's Creed greatest qualities in its open-world design and clever climbing mechanics.\nYou can climb anything in Breath of the Wild, much like you can scale most structures in Rome in Assassin's Creed 2. Where Assassin's Creed offers chaos and bloodshed, Breath of the Wild is a breath of fresh serenity, and can be incredibly therapeutic and relaxing when you're not being chased by Cucco's or aggravating fire dragons. All these years later, it remains one of the best Switch games available; Breath of the Wild is an even sweeter deal for Assassin's Creed fans, who should feel right at home clambering up the face of cliffs across its 50-hour story.\nRead our The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review\n7. Hitman 3\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\nIf you're really all about the stealthy murder, Hitman 3 delivers it by the bucketload. The latest installment of the series takes you everywhere from a Knives Out style murder mystery in a mansion to hanging off the side of the tallest building in the world dressed as a waiter.\nHitman 3 might not deliver the same open-world exploration, but it does offer you the same wealth of choice when it comes to how you complete your objectives. Whether you're in a Berlin club or at a wine mixer, the game is a big old toybox of death to play with, with assassination methods far more sophisticated than a quick stab with a hidden blade.\nRead our Hitman 3 review\n6. Batman: Arkham Asylum\nDeveloper: Rocksteady Studios\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nOriginally released in 2009, Batman: Arkham Asylum kicked off a series of modern DC games that are considered among the best Batman games in existence. In 2019 it's available as part of the Return to Arkham collection, remastered for next-gen consoles. Don't let its age fool you; this is a timeless classic that will delight comic-book fans and gadget-savvy Assassin's Creed players who enjoy the counter-based combat seen in Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey.\nWith an exciting linear narrative and a host of collectibles to pilfer for as you explore the dreaded Arkham Asylum, the world feels deceptively open, despite the game being on rails. Sneaking around atop gargoyles and swooping down to knock out goons is still as riveting as ever, especially for Assassin's Creed players who love to systematically wipe out a room with stealth tactics and smoke bombs.\nRead our Batman: Arkham Asylum review\n5. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nKojima's final game before moving on to Death Stranding, Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, is his unfinished masterpiece, a bittersweet sayonara to the series, which was his baby, packed with adrenaline and plenty of stories left untold. Despite the unfortunate dramatics surrounding its release, it still holds up as one of the best stealth games, and whilst its modern setting doesn't reflect Assassin's Creed, it's toy-box design does.\nIt's so wonderfully fine-tuned and full of minuscule details to do with physics and enemy AI - you can really toy with your enemies in this game and make their grey matter unravel through mischievous stealth - whilst enjoying an action-packed story playing as Venom Snake. Also, if you enjoyed managing real estate and your wide net of assassins in Brotherhood and other later entries in the series, no doubt you will latch on to the meta game of Mother Base, raising your own troops and expanding your offshore dominion. The Phantom Pain is considered one of the best Metal Gear games for good reason!\n4. Ghost of Tsushima\nDeveloper: Sucker Punch\nPlatform(s): PS5, PS4, PC\nAssassin's Creed is known for taking us across the annals of history, and if you're looking for another period piece to delve into that also features a fantastic stealth system and engaging combat, Ghost of Tsushima is well worth considering. From performing air kills from the tops of tents to sneaking through tall grass and taking out foes unawares, you'll be treading a lot of familiar ground in Sucker Punch's adventure as protagonist Jin Sakai.\nSet in a beautiful open-world, you can expect to engage in sword duels, fight a myriad of enemies, and get swept up in a memorable journey that takes place in the late 13th century. And with the upcoming sequel Ghost of Yotei, there's never been a better time to check it out.\nRead our Ghost of Tsushima review\n3. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\nDeveloper: FromSoftware\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nAssassin's Creed games have recently started to use From Software's finest features as a muse to invigorate its tried-and-tested model, most notably in the combat department, with Origins and Odyssey offering up similar cat-and-mouse gameplay to Dark Souls. As a result, if you\u2019ve played the most modern Creed games and you've enjoyed taking on enemies, you might want to dip into one of the best FromSoftware games \u2013 Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.\nWith its focus on stealth and high maneuverability thanks to the grappling hook, it's the closest game in the Soulsborne roster to Assassin's Creed. Of course, it\u2019s a lot more unforgiving than what you might be used to, but with most AC games being a pushover in the difficulty department, the bump in trouble might feel quite rewarding.\nRead our Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice review\n2. Mirror's Edge: Catalyst\nDeveloper: DICE\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nDropping just one year after the original Assassin's Creed, Mirrors Edge still stands out as one of the most seminal parkour games that paved the way for many future open-world movement mechanics, with some of the most fluid animations and adrenaline-pumping set pieces curating a serious atmosphere in its neon-laden world.\nMirror's Edge Catalyst is the sequel that followed suit, and whilst stumbling at a few hurdles, it's well worth playing if you enjoy parkour games and would like to see the platforming performed from a different perspective from the one seen in Assassin's Creed, alongside a more involved narrative and tactile melee combat.\nRead our Mirror's Edge Catalyst review\n1. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\nDeveloper: CD Projekt RED\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S\nEasily one of the best open world games ever made, The Witcher 3 is an absolute behemoth of an RPG that absolutely influenced the reinvention of Assassin's Creed, from the combat to the scaling gear system.\nFans of Origins and Odyssey won't be too far from home when they step into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, and will most likely delight in its bustling narrative and branching, lore-heavy side quests that enrich its enrapturing medieval world in a fashion that Assassin's Creed is still trying to capture. With potent character dynamics, a fleshed-out combat system, and some moving moments, you couldn't go wrong embarking on this epic 50-100-hour tale.\nRead our The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review\nIf you're still looking for something new to play, check out the most anticipated upcoming PS5 games and upcoming Xbox Series X games on the way.\nJordan Oloman has hundreds of bylines across outlets like GamesRadar+, PC Gamer, USA Today, The Guardian, The Verge, The Washington Post, and more.

      "text": "Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap, DLC and future content\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be a huge game, but future DLC will make it even bigger\nThe Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap has been unveiled, showing off what Ubisoft is adding over the next few months. We already knew about the Claws of Awaji expansion, which will continue Yasuke and Naoe's story beyond the main quest of Assassin's Creed Shadows, but now we know that two Story Drops, new parkour moves, more difficulty options, and an expanded alarm will all be added first. There\u2019s a lot to go over, so here's everything we know about future updates, expansions, and DLCs for Assassin's Creed Shadows.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows update roadmap\nUbisoft has unveiled new post-launch content plans for Year 1 of Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows, which include new quests, parkour improvements, new game plus, and the previously announced Claws of Awaji expansion.\nUnlike previous Assassin's Creed games, Shadows will not have a Season Pass which means that these content updates will be free, with the Claws of Awaji expansion (covered further below) and new store items being the only exceptions. These free updates will also be packed with new activities and features, as well as improvements to existing aspects of the game.\nHere are all the updates Ubisoft has announced so far and when they\u2019ll release for the Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows roadmap:\nEarly May\n- First Story Drop, \u201cThe Works of Luis Frois\u201d: A free update focused on learning more about the Jesuit scholar Luis Frois, who appears at various points in the main story, notably right at the beginning when Yasuke (then Diogo) is acting as a bodyguard.\n- Codex update\n- Quality-of-life improvements\nLate May\n- First Special Collaboration: Who this collaboration is with has not yet been announced.\n- Parkour update: New height-gaining back-ejects, newly animated height-gaining side-ejects and an entirely new vertical ledge jump move.

      "text": "Assassin's Creed Mirage's Basim wants to be in Netflix's show, and fans think this could be \"part of a calculated audience warm-up\"\nIt would be a great game to adapt\nThere's an Assassin's Creed series currently in development at Netflix, and the actor who voices Basim and lends him his face, Lee Majdoub, wants in on the action. He may not be a household name, but one fan doesn't think including him would be far-fetched.\nThe official Assassin's Creed Twitter account posted an update on the series, writing \"Netflix has greenlit the live-action Assassin's Creed series! Robert Patino and David Wiener will co-showrun.\"\n\"I would be more than happy to 'work in the dark to serve the light' on this project,\" Majdoub quote tweets. \"Just saying. Incase Netflix is listening.\"\nHere's My Theory on the Upcoming Assassin's Creed Show from r/assassinscreed\nOver on Reddit, one fan reckons including Basim could be a good idea. \"What if this series is actually that rumored Mirage continuation the Saudis were funding?\" they ask. \"Could all of this just be part of a calculated audience warm-up \u2013 something that\u2019s become pretty common in modern show marketing?\"\nBasim's outing in Assassin's Creed Mirage wasn't exactly a fan or critic favorite, but it did well enough and the story lends itself well to a TV show. It's essentially a detective series set against a backdrop of assassins. And, its cast already has film and TV experience.\nMajdoub stars in the Sonic movies as Eggman's assistant, and assassin mentor Shohreh Aghdashloo was in The Expanse, as well as Penguin and a long list of other shows and games. She's a very prolific actor, and her voice adds tremendous gravitas to any character she portrays; she'd be great.\nMirage would also be a great game to adapt due to its compelling plot. It's just a detective mystery with assassins, what's not to love?\nWhatever happens, let's hope this series is better than the movie that came out a few years ago. It was proof that just having Michael Fassbender in a film isn't enough to make it good.\nFor now, though, we'll have to wait and see. In the meantime, check out our ranking of the best Assassin's Creed games.

      "text": "Ubisoft hints at the future of Assassin's Creed's Basim but says \"no post-launch content is planned for Mirage\"\nWill we get more Basim games in the future?\nUbisoft says it has plans for Assassin's Creed protagonist Basim but \"no post-launch content is planned for Mirage.\"\nAs spotted by Gamespot, two of Assassin's Creed Mirage's developers - narrative director Stephane Boudon and art director Jean-Luc Sala - took part in a Reddit AMA and gave fans of protagonist Basim a glimmer of hope. When asked if the team ever considered developing DLC or storyline content for Mirage based on the community's positive reception, Boudon said: \"Mirage [has been designed] as a standalone experience without any [DLC planned].\"\nThe developer continues: \"However, we have ideas on how we could extend the story of Basim, surely. But as of today, no post-launch content is planned for Mirage.\" Boudon's response is vague, but it does suggest that Ubisoft might not be completely done with Basim's story - just Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nComment from r/assassinscreed\nThere are plenty of other Assassin's Creed games in development, so it's always possible that Basim could appear in one of them. Not only have we got Assassin's Creed Hexe on the way, but also smaller projects like the upcoming mobile game Assassin's Creed Jade, which had a closed beta test last year, and Assassin's Creed Red, which is set in Japan and planned to launch sometime in 2025. The timelines around those games don't necessarily match up with Basim, but stranger things than a bit of temporal jumping have happened to the series in the past.\nElsewhere in the AMA, one user asked the team if they'd be interested in developing \"old-school\" Assassin's Creed games, to which Boudon said: \"We work in the dark to serve the light,\" along with a winking emoji. It doesn't give us much to work with but at least we know that the studio is aware of the demand.\nCan't get enough of Basim? Find out how Ubisoft transformed Assassin's Creed Mirage protagonist Basim from evil to endearing.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter studying Film Studies and Creative Writing at university, I was lucky enough to land a job as an intern at Player Two PR where I helped to release a number of indie titles.

It's a huge change from the last entry in the entry in the series, with Ubisoft taking a back-to-basics approach that sends Assassin's Creed back its roots \u2013 plenty of stealth, acrobatic assassinations, and parkour in a big city environment.\nFans of the earliest adventures of Alta\u00efr and Ezio will feel more at home in AC Mirage as it's a turn away from the expansive scope of the open worlds seen in Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Odyssey. That's one of the reasons Mirage became one of our most anticipated upcoming Assassin's Creed games. However, with a lot to get to grips with and still plenty of collectible items to collect, you might need some help as you play Assassin's Creed Mirage. That's why we've compiled all our tips and tricks into one Assassin's Creed Mirage guide.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage review\nIn our Assassin's Creed Mirage review, we scored the game a 4/5 and praised Ubisoft for delivering on its pledge to deliver an installment which honored the series' roots.

Most players should be able to get through the whole story in around 20 hours, but your completion time will vary depending on how much time you spend exploring Baghdad.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage tips\nWith a lot of old mechanics brought back and made new and other mechanics stripped out, there's a fair bit to get used to when starting the game, so these 10 Assassin's Creed Mirage tips will help you learn the ropes of the Hidden Ones.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage outfits\nBasim can be dressed up in a plethora of Assassin's Creed Mirage outfits and costumes, with outfits providing unique perks to buff Basim's abilities too.

These offer some really unique perks that are well worth picking up as early as possible.\nBest Assassin's Creed Mirage Skills\nAs well as some improvements from his outfits, Basim also gets 23 Skills across three trees to unlock, providing lots of nice enhancements to his assassination abilities.

However, our guide will help you track down the loot quickly.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage story and missions\nWith lots of little cases and investigations to work through, Assassin's Creed Mirage has a short but varied story that involves going all over Baghdad, utilizing different mechanics in the game to get the information you need and assassinate those key targets:\n- Assassin's Creed Mirage Merchant Tokens are important for certain missions, while exploring the world, and for getting discounts at Trader shops.\n- Knowing how to eavesdrop in Assassin's Creed Mirage will help you get through a few missions that require it to learn key information.

The mode will be available once you beat the main story and the credits roll, resetting your progression and discovered locations but letting you keep your character level, gear, skill points, Knowledge rank, and Hideout progression.\nNew Game+ will also give you the option to skip the game's prologue entirely, and you won't be bothered by any of the tutorial sections that were there in your first playthrough.\nAlso on July 29, Assassin's Creed Shadows is getting its first level cap increase, from 60 to 80 for all players regardless of whether they're playing New Game+ or not. The \"Progression Update\" will also add new Knowledge Ranks, Mastery and Knowledge Skill ranks, and new upgrades for all Hideout buildings.\nThe July 29 update will also add the new Project 3 to the Animus menu, bringing along new resources, data files, and exclusive Animus-themed rewards.\nComing at the beginning of September, the game's newly revealed \"quality-of-life improvement update\" will add \"some of the most requested features from our community\" since launch. This update will let you skip time of day from dusk 'til dawn and vice-versa, and it'll unfog the map when you do a viewpoint synchronization. It'll also uncap the frame rate on PC, add some upgrades to the Hideout, add the new Mythic and Artifact upgrade levels to Forge, and add \"additional goodies that may be familiar to long-time series fans.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nFinally, there's no more guessing as to when the game's first expansions, Claws of Awaji, is coming out. Ubisoft has officially set a September 16 release date for the DLC, free for everyone who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows.\nBy no means is this sort of thing unique to Ubisoft games, but boy am I feeling mighty vindicated in my decision to hold off on playing Assassin's Creed Shadows at launch. It wasn't easy; a AAA open-world game set in feudal Japan is very much my jam; but I feel like a lot of these post-launch features could've, and maybe should've, been there day one. Or, maybe, that's just what I tell myself when I know I have a dozen great games in my backlog and simply don't have time for another 60-hour game.\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side.
