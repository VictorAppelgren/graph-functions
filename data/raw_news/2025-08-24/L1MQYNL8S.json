  "title": "Tungsten's Key Role in the World of Critical Minerals",
  "description": "Oliver Friesen, CEO of Guardian Metal Resources, discusses his company's place in the global critical-mineral landscape as well as the challenge of navigating trade tensions and nationalism as it vies for control over some of these materials. Oliver speaks with Tim Stenovec and Norah Mulinda on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Tungsten is one of the most dense metals on the planet and also has the highest melting point. So it's been used in the production of munitions for decades and decades and decades. Now, that's just one small use case. But effectively, when you look at the entire critical metal supply chain, if even one of those metals isn't there, that can shut down manufacturing in the United States of America. So it's important that we focus on not only just rare earths, which, as you mentioned, are very important antimony, but tungsten is definitely up there considering the fact that we're very reliant on unfriendly adversaries for global tungsten supplies. So I want to talk a bit more about your company in particular here, which and markets, you know, maybe EVs, defense, renewables are really driving the most urgency for your business right now. Yeah, I would say probably the most urgent use case is across the fence. Because of that density, it's it's ubiquitous and it's very important in the production of munitions and and things like tank armors as well. So really right now, given the geopolitical landscape, we're seeing a huge amount of a surge in demand and increase in demand across the defense industry for this metal. But as you pointed out, you know, it's not just the defense metal. This is a metal that's used in a lot of other industries, some that come to mind. Aerospace, automotive, green energy is another one. It's just it's a really important metal. It's almost irreplaceable. And a lot of these technologies. So defense is driving the narrative right now. But at the same time, you know, we're hearing major manufacturers in the Unites States of America are actually saying we can't get this tungsten If we don't get it, we're going to be shutting down. So the Pentagon in July provided a $6.2 million award to Golden Metal resources. It's the US unit of your company to perform a pre-feasibility study for a tungsten mine near Hawthorne, Nevada. Is this is this all the financing that you will need? Will you need more from the DOD? Will you need more from the government? Will you need to raise more? Yes. So it's it's part of the puzzle for sure. So that $6.2 million award that we've received from the Department of Defense, which obviously we're very grateful to the current administration for that award, will cover some of the key engineering workstreams as well as part of that study. But you're right, there are other expenditures associated with bringing that project and our projects into production. But concurrently with that, with that award from the Department of Defense, we raised a $21 million U.S. dollars, predominantly with existing shareholders, almost all institutional. So we use those funds to then cover the other additional costs and all the funding combined. Really, the focus is on delivering two key tungsten mines to the U.S. market, of which it's a metal. The U.S. has not mine for over a decade. Do you need government support when it comes to this project? No, we don't. And, you know, for instance, we acquired Pilot Mountain, which is the project that's received the award from the Department of Defense almost five years ago. So it was a much different market then. The landscape was much different. And even at that time, we acquired it because we felt like it would be an economic tungsten operation at previous pricing norms, which is around $300, what's called a metric tonne unit, or about $30,000 a ton. That being said, the price fast forward five years. China has completely banned the exports of all tungsten to the U.S. market. The price is closer to $50,000 a ton right now. But even at historic norms, you know, this project in our projects, we believe makes sense. But obviously, you know, the tailwinds we're seeing now across the federal funding landscape, but also permitting gives us that much more confidence to push these projects forward and deliver mines in America to the US industrial base and defense partners. All right. Let's talk a little bit about China. You brought it up here. How do you see China's dominance in the rare earth processing keeping your strategy here? Yeah, No, it's a really good point, Nora, and I'm glad you brought it up, because what, what sort of sets tungsten apart from, you know, the antibodies in the virus, as we've discussed, is the fact that the downstream processing capacity actually fully exists on US soil. It's one of the kind of the very few critical metals of which the US has the ability to actually take what's called a tungsten concentrate and turn it into actual usable finished products for defence and for industry. So the benefit that we have is that the only thing missing in the US right now is a domestic mined source. You know, we import in the US all of our concentrates from from other countries. And just, just to give you a data point, China, Russia and North Korea combined represent 90% of total global supply of tungsten. I mean, just let that kind of data points it in. But the thing that's missing right now in the US is the mine supply. The processing is there. So as soon as we can plug in our two Nevada based tungsten mines, you have a fully circular tungsten supply chain that exists within the bounds of the United States of America. So where do you see demand for rare earth materials and all of that just more broadly over the next, say, 5 to 10 years? Yeah. So tungsten specifically, we're seeing very, very healthy compounded annual growth rates across the different sectors that need it. Defence is is certainly leading the charge right now. You know, we're seeing we're seeing the EU and NATO and the US defence budgets up are up across the board. So that drives the demand for tungsten as you can probably imagine. But also, you know, we mentioned automotive, aerospace, these are all other other sectors that are. The demand for tungsten is increasing quite considerably. So we're seeing healthy growth across the different growth areas. And another use case that many of your listeners probably are not aware of is nuclear fusion. So not to be confused with nuclear fission, but effectively trying to harness the energy of the sun here on earth and the only metal with a high enough melting point to contain a nuclear fusion reactor is tungsten. So we see longer term considerable demand growth from this this very important energy supply excuse me, technology that should be come in line in the next couple of years here and next maybe decade. One of the most read stories on the Bloomberg terminal this week was about the Trump administration or President Trump's new brand of economic statecraft deals like we might see with Intel, for example, or the Department of Defense deal with EMP materials. I mean, you could throw other companies into that as well. AMD and NVIDIA with 15% of certain chip sales in China going to the government, maybe even U.S. Steel with that so-called golden share that the US government has with U.S. Steel. What's in your view? Because you've taken some money from the government this year, What's the difference between a deal like the one that EMP materials got in which the DOD will take a stake and the stake that the Trump administration is contemplating taking in Intel? Do you see a difference in those deals? Yeah, for sure. So the MP materials deal is pretty groundbreaking for this sector and I think this is really a strong signal to the US critical metals industry that, that, you know, the administration is serious about minded America, which is really encouraging to see. So the materials deal, there's lots of different parts to that. One of them is the price floor of the direct investment and also the federal award as well. So we've received just an award. So this is that this is money that we can go and use to fast track key engineering steps as part of our project. But what I'll say is that, you know, there's you know, there's there's speculation that some of these unique and new sort of benefits that MP has had with this deal could could be applied across the sector. So effectively, the doors have opened up for this this this type of deal to be done across the defence supply chain, but also the critical metal supply chain. So anyways, I think all in all it's it's a really strong signal to the market. It's a really strong signal to myself as a CEO of a critical metals company that the US administration is serious about mines in America and that obviously means that we have these projects at exactly the right time and try to deliver this key metal to the US market. We're speaking with Oliver Friesen, the CEO at Guardian Metal Resources to London based Metals Exploration and Development Company that's looking to bring production of tungsten back to the U.S.. Oliver, You mentioned the door is open. Is your door open for an investment from the U.S. government where the government or the Department of Defense would actually take an equity stake in the company? Would you welcome that? Of course. Yet we'd be. We'd be. We'd more than welcome that. Like I said, we all we have right now is the award from the D.O.D., which is incredibly important for the business. But, you know, we're we're, we're our goal here is to deliver these minds to the U.S. market. So anything that we can do to help get support from the current administration and across the industry, we will obviously have that conversation. But the time is so critical right now. Like I like I said, the U.S. has no domestic mine supply. And we believe that we are the leading company when it comes to and expression development. So we're obviously looking to have any conversation that will help us get to our goal quicker. Are you having conversations right now about that? I can't speak to that. What I can say is that, you know, the award that we receive from the Department of Events was only about three weeks ago. So we're now really focused on getting that money and focusing it in the ground and to work towards creating U.S. jobs at our projects. So that's the focus right now. But obviously, you know, we're looking to tap into any tailwinds that can be available to defense and critical metals companies that are focused on U.S. projects. Oliver, How do you navigate trade tensions and resource nationalism in markets where you operate? Yeah. I mean, we try not to get too focused on that. You know, it's there's a lot of noise out there. There's a lot of movement across tariffs and trade relationships right now. I think the main signal to to to our company and to myself as the CEO is that there's a huge push for minds in America. We want to see these metals actually being mined on American soil. So we try not to get too kind of caught up in the day to day. You know, we have a job here, which is to deliver these projects to the U.S. market. But, you know, it's encouraging to see some of these things that I think really once again point to the fact that the current administration is very focused on mines in America and nowhere else in the world. So that's obviously a huge benefit benefit to us as owners of two key tungsten projects that are both on U.S. soil and also in the great state of Nevada, which is a very mining friendly place to be operating. All of our yes or no. How quickly or can I should say the U.S. become rare earth independent from China? Oh, man, it's a good question. I mean, yes, we can. I mean, there's some great geology here. We need a huge amount of support from the administration, which we're seeing now, but we have to carry through. That's the biggest thing. We can't stop, start, stop, start. We have this same sort of support pushed forward over five, ten, 15 years. The landscape will look a lot different and the US will become a lot less reliant on unfriendly countries for these types of battles.",
