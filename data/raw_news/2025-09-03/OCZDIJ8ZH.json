  "content": "GeekWire\u2019s startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter , and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory .\n\nNewDays, a Seattle startup using a generative AI therapy to treat people with mild dementia, today announced $7 million in funding to expand their service.\n\nThe company offers telehealth visits with clinicians once or twice a month combined with frequent, personalized conversations with an AI companion called Sunny.\n\nIn a pilot project including more than 1,000 users, participants gave the service a 4.5 out of 5 approval rating and 100% of respondents said they felt \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201ca lot better\u201d after using the program. The pilot ran in Washington, California and Florida and the service is now being offered in Texas as well.\n\nThe need to support seniors with cognitive decline is massive. An estimated one-third of Americans 65 and older have either dementia or mild cognitive impairment, said the NewDays team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had this large group of people that for the longest time that been told there is no cure, there is no drug that can fix your disease, there is no drug that can stop your disease,\u201d said co-founder Babak Parviz. \u201cBasically, you cannot do anything, just live with it \u2026 And what we\u2019re saying is that there is hope so you can actually take charge and meaningfully, actually do things that can make your life better and make life better for your loved ones.\u201d\n\nNewDays\u2019 strategy for care is based on research from the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT), a study that provided virtual chats between healthcare providers and elderly participants that was led by a Harvard Medical School scientist.\n\nThe project showed demonstrable benefits, slowing cognitive decline and reducing loneliness. But a model using human clinicians isn\u2019t scalable to serve the millions of Americans alone who need treatment and the costs would be prohibitive.\n\nSo NewDays offers AI-generated conversations that aim to mimic the treatment provided in I-CONECT.\n\nAs Parviz explains, the startup took clinically proven interventions and assigned 90%-95% of the work to AI while including a human clinician to supervise the care to make sure it\u2019s tailored, appropriate and effective.\n\nParviz, who serves as CEO, launched the startup last year with Daniel Kelly. Parviz was a vice president at Amazon where he led the company\u2019s Grand Challenge initiative to discover new areas of operation. Prior to that role, he was at Google X and ran the Google Glass team. Kelly previously oversaw engineering teams at Amazon and Google X.\n\nBoth have dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s in their families and were eager to apply their tech expertise to providing care to people suffering from these diseases.\n\nThe AI-led conversations are personalized to users and provide specific types of therapies including cognitive stimulation, cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation. The chats with Sunny will cover a users\u2019 interests and reminiscences. They\u2019ll practice skills needed in day-to-day life, like remembering a series of questions that come up naturally in conversations with friends and family.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a substitute for their social connections,\u201d Parviz said. \u201cWe want to be an amplifier there and sort of the builder of confidence, so they can actually practice with us and then go to do more human-to-human conversations.\u201d\n\nKelly said that his father has moderate dementia and enjoys talking with Sunny during stretches of 30 minutes or more. For his dad, the AI chats are a safe, non-judgmental place for interactions.\n\n\u201cHe knows that this is a piece of software and he can open up to it and not be worried about making mistakes or repeating himself, and it just kind of allows him a lot of freedom to have conversations in ways that he might refrain from when he\u2019s interacting with other people,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAnother important benefit is Sunny is so engaging that Kelly\u2019s mom gets a break from caregiving during that time.\n\nPeople anywhere can try Sunny for free. The treatment that includes check-ins and personalized oversight by a dedicated clinician combined with unlimited AI-chats is $99 per month. That service is currently limited to Washington, California, Florida and Texas with plans for expansion.\n\nNewDays does not share outside of the company any data collected in the conversations unless it\u2019s needed for someone\u2019s care.",

For too long, people experiencing these challenges have been simply told to \u201cwait and see.\u201d\nNewDays today announced an oversubscribed $7 million seed funding from General Catalyst and Madrona and the expansion of its science-backed cognitive health treatment program to Texas, following a successful pilot phase in California, Washington, and Florida.\nNewDays combines regular telehealth appointments with expert clinicians and AI-powered cognitive exercises delivered by its AI companion, Sunny. Between appointments, patients engage with Sunny frequently in clinician-assigned, long-form conversational exercises that bolster verbal fluency, improve memory, prevent social isolation, and build strategies for overcoming daily functional challenges. Powered by the AI platform, clinicians are able to optimize their patient\u2019s program based on their interactions.\n\u201cFor too long, people experiencing cognitive changes have been told there's nothing they can do beyond maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preparing for decline,\u201d said Babak Parviz, NewDays cofounder and CEO. \u201cBut the latest research shows there are non-pharmacological interventions that can meaningfully help, and advancements in AI let us take those game-changing findings and provide them widely in a way that wasn\u2019t technologically possible even a couple of years ago.\u201d\nNewDays is based on evidence from more than 300 clinical trials and 50+ meta analyses and fueled by exclusive access to the methods and materials used in the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT). This study found that structured frequent conversations with a trained clinician resulted in measurable delays in cognitive decline and reduction in loneliness and isolation in adults aged 75 and up. The top participants in the study delayed cognitive decline for six months or more, proving that targeted intervention can make a real difference.\n\"The I-CONECT study demonstrated that regular guided conversational engagement can significantly benefit cognitive function in older adults,\u201d said Hiroko Dodge, Ph.D., professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and principal investigator of the I-CONECT study, who is an advisor to NewDays. \u201cFor years, we've known these approaches work, but scaling them has been virtually impossible due to the limited availability of trained professionals and cost. NewDays represents a breakthrough in bringing scientifically validated cognitive rehabilitation to those who need it most.\"\nParticipants in NewDays' early access program say that conversations with Sunny are mentally engaging and help guard against isolation. They also report speaking more freely without fear of judgment. With over 1,000 users who have signed up to try the AI, and a 4.5 out of 5 customer satisfaction score, NewDays has successfully completed its pilot phase. Most significantly, 100% of survey respondents reported feeling \"better\" or \"a lot better\" after engaging with the full treatment program of virtual visits with clinicians and having frequent conversations with AI.\n\"It works your mind,\u201d said Frank Poulsen, 72, of Seattle, a participant in the early access program. \u201cMemory loss is somewhat isolating, just by its nature. These steps are good because you\u2019re reorienting yourself to complex thought without feeling nervous or judged.\"\n\"At General Catalyst, we're focused on backing transformative healthcare solutions that make care more affordable, accessible, and proactive,\u201d said Holly Maloney, managing director, General Catalyst. \u201cNewDays exemplifies this approach, addressing a critical gap in cognitive health with a science-backed solution that puts patients first. Their combination of AI innovation with human clinical oversight represents the future of digital health.\u201d\n\"The NewDays team brings together world-class expertise in AI, technology innovation, and clinical neuropsychology,\u201d said Tim Porter, managing director, Madrona. \u201cWe've seen firsthand how AI is transforming industries, but few applications have the potential for such meaningful human impact as NewDays. Their approach to leveraging AI for cognitive health is precisely the kind of purposeful innovation we champion at Madrona.\u201d\nNewDays was founded by Babak Parviz and Daniel Kelly. As VP at Amazon, Parviz founded and led the organization responsible for identifying, investing in and operationalizing new areas for the company, including healthcare. At Google X, he founded and led the Google Glass team from inception to launch. Daniel Kelly headed engineering teams at Amazon and Google X.\nNewDays is available in Washington, California, Florida, and Texas, expanding to additional states by year-end. The program offers free daily AI exercises to everyone, with premium subscribers receiving personalized treatment plans that combine licensed clinician consultations (often insurance-covered) with customized AI-powered cognitive exercises.\nAbout NewDays\nNewDays is transforming cognitive health with a science-backed, AI-powered treatment designed for people experiencing cognitive decline.
