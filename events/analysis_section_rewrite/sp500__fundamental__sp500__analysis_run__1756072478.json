      "feedback": "High-signal upgrade path: your core idea of a multi-year, regime-shift story is solid, but push it from a descriptive narrative to a formal, first-principles framework with explicit regimes, triggers, and invalidation points. Actionable edits: (1) anchor to invariants and regime map—state first-principles anchors (e.g., ROIC vs. WACC dynamics, real rate differentials, terms-of-trade shifts, productivity gains from re-shoring, and BoP/external financing constraints) and define two to three regimes (e.g., a) protectionist, domestic-capex, supply-chain reorientation; b) gradual tariff normalization with mixed globalization; c) tariff escalations+cascading capital expenditure in AI/semis); specify transition conditions (tariff levels, capex commitments, domestic capability milestones) and what would force regime change. (2) lay out a clean causal chain from policy to pricing: tariffs and policy certainty boost domestic capex in semis/AI/data-center infra, lift productivity over time, alter inflation and real rates, shift risk premia, and reprice equities via ROIC/WACC discipline; tie to market signals (e.g., Ford’s cyclical / EV-loss dynamics and ROIC commentary) to ground the chain in observable leverage points (SGB2PAZGK; 65UUBU0OR; 22PL3Q360). (3) strengthen base-case with quantified anchors drawn from sources: base-case pricing path, inflation impulse from tariffs, and capex impulse magnitudes (e.g., the Ford/auto-cycle, ROIC example, and dividend yields cited in 22PL3Q360 and 65UUBU0OR; O4ZEED2EB for CEO-pay linkage as a sentiment/structure proxy). (4) expand scenario detail and triggers: enumerate bull/bear/regime-transition catalysts (e.g., baseline tariff 10% with China at higher reciprocals up to 34% or 145% in different episodes; Ford EV losses and 5–6% dividend yield; ROIC vs WACC thresholds around 10–12% vs ~6–8% as a decision rule from ROIC discussions) and specify invalidation tests (tariff rollbacks, rapid productivity uplift, or a sustained inflation/interest-rate pivot). (5) reconcile conflicts and add granularity on sectors: acknowledge Ford’s 17% YTD gain as context for cyclicality vs. long-run ROIC expectations, cite that Ford’s EV losses damp profitability (65UUBU0OR), and contrast with sectors where ROIC-driven pricing could premiumify valuations (22PL3Q360; ROIC framing in the Motley Fool pieces). (6) format and coverage tweaks: present a concise base-case paragraph plus a short “watch list” and “risks” subsection, then a clear “confidence” statement; ensure every substantive claim is tied to a source ID (SGB2PAZGK, O4ZEED2EB, 22PL3Q360, 65UUBU0OR) and explicitly note where a topic (e.g., BoP, real-rate anchors) isn’t covered by the given sources and would require adding external macro data. (7) quantify wherever possible—convert qualitative claims into numbers or ranges drawn from the sources (e.g., 7.7% CEO pay rise and $19m median pay from O4ZEED2EB; Ford’s 5.18% dividend yield and 10.3 forward P/E from 65UUBU0OR; Ford’s EV loss and 4.3% margin hints from 22PL3Q360; 17% YTD in 2025 for Ford; 11.8% ROIC example from ROIC discussion). (8) tighten citations: attach source IDs after each claim or block of claims to ensure clarity on what’s supported. This yields a world-class structure: a multi-year regime map with invariant anchors, a transparent causal chain to market pricing, base-case plus well-defined catalysts/invalidation, sector-specific nuances, precise quantification, and tightly cited sources.
