  "title": "OPEC+ Leaves Traders With Cliffhanger as Tumultuous Chapter Ends",
  "description": "OPEC+ closed a two-year chapter in its oil strategy on Sunday with the last in a series of bumper oil production increases. But it left crude traders with a cliffha\u2026",
  "content": "The 547,000 barrel-a-day output increase they approved on Sunday completes the reversal \u2014 one year ahead of schedule \u2014 of a giant supply cutback made in 2023. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have fast-tracked the revival in a bid to reclaim market share.\n\nYet they also have unfinished business: another layer of supplies, also halted two years ago, amounting to 1.66 million barrels a day, which is currently due to remain offline until late 2026. And on Sunday delegates were offering less, rather than more, clarity regarding its fate.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nDepending on oil market conditions, the coalition could press on with restarting this tranche, officials said. Or, as some delegates suggested last month, the producers could take a pause. Alternatively, if markets slump, they might even completely reverse the recent surge. A follow-up meeting was set for Sept. 7 to review the situation.\n\n\u201cWe can expect the group to adopt a wait-and-see approach for at least the first several months,\u201d said Greg Brew, senior analyst at Eurasia Group. \u201cBut if there is a contraction in US supply, and if demand growth and the general macro environment remains favorable, I think further unwinding of cuts should be expected.\u201d\n\nWhile oil demand has held up this year, a projected slowdown in China and swelling supplies across the Americas leave world markets on track for a hefty surplus of 2 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. Weak US economic data on Friday underscored the risks to consumption from Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nForecasters such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. JPMorgan Chase & Co. see crude futures, already down 6.7% this year to near $70 a barrel in London, sliding further towards $60 later in the year. That\u2019s considerably lower than the levels the Saudis and other OPEC+ members need to cover government spending.\n\nGoldman expects that the coalition will most likely pause and hold output levels steady for some time as it takes stock of supply and demand balances. Five crude traders surveyed by Bloomberg last week also predicted a hiatus.\n\nOn the other hand, if Riyadh is genuinely committed to pursuing market share \u2014 as people familiar with its thinking believe \u2014 it should ignore those forecasts and press on with restarting the 1.66 million-barrel tranche regardless.\n\n\u201cOPEC+ will still need to go through the motions to show they\u2019re taking control of their supplies,\u201d said Harry Tchilinguirian, group head of research at Onyx Capital Group. \u201cBut ultimately, market share is now the name of the game.\u201d",
