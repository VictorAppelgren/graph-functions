  "title": "Uvalde school records show teenage gunman's spiral before 2022 shooting",
  "description": "School district officials have released text messages, personnel files and student records of the shooter from the 2022 attack at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 students and two teachers",
  "content": "The records are among thousands of pages released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District following a yearslong legal battle to withhold documents connected to one of the deadliest classroom attacks in U.S. history.\n\nMany of the documents offer scant new revelations surrounding the attack and the gunman, whose troubled history has been laid out in previous state and federal investigations. Nor do the records \u2014 which do not include any video from the day of the shooting \u2014 shed light on the hesitant and widely criticized police response.\n\nThe documents include the personnel file of former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, one of two officers facing criminal charges over the slow law enforcement response, and emails to and from school administrators in the days and weeks after the attack.\n\nAt 11:40 a.m. on the day of the shooting, Arredondo received a text from a school district secretary noting that another employee reported hearing gunfire outside the school.\n\n\u201cThey went ahead and locked themselves down,\u201d the text to Arredondo read.\n\nArredondo and Adrian Gonzales, another former Uvalde school district officer, are the only responding officers who face criminal charges for their actions that day. They both have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment and are scheduled for trial later this year.\n\nMedia organizations, including The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. A Texas appeals court in July upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling that the records must be released.\n\nThe records are not the public\u2019s first glimpse inside one of the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shootings and the slow law enforcement response that has been widely condemned. Last year, city officials in Uvalde released police body cam videos and recordings of 911 calls.\n\nSalvador Ramos' academic records showed a student who as a kindergartener was described as \u201ca remarkable little boy\u201d who was a \u201cvery hard worker,\u201d but he went on to be suspended multiple times in junior high and withdrew from high school because of \u201cpoor academic performance.\u201d\n\nThe records showed a student spiraling further into academic and behavioral problems, cut classes and confrontations with teachers through middle school. By ninth grade, he was classified as \u201cat risk.\u201d\n\nThe records align with previous findings released by investigators, including a 2022 Texas House report that laid out how the gunman \u201cturned down a dark path\u201d after dropping out of school and became increasingly isolated in the year prior to the shooting.\n\nArredondo has been the target of much of the blame for the law enforcement response that saw nearly 400 local, state and federal officers wait more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers as parents outside begged them to go in.\n\nThe Arredondo emails after the shooting show a chief still being asked questions about security at district events, concerns about someone who liked Ramos' social media posts and a note from a district administrator 12 days after the attack that asked: \u201cHow are you today?\"\n\nThe Uvalde district placed Arredondo on paid leave on June 22 in a letter that told him he was not to enter any district building, go on any campus or attend any school activity. The letter also directed Arredondo to cooperate with any investigation and not to discuss the investigation with district employees.\n\nText messages between a group of Uvalde school staffers show in the days after the shooting, officials briefly noted criticisms of the response but avoided responding via text message. One exchange noted a law enforcement timeline that included a 77-minute delay. Another referenced a news article where a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson was pressed on the delayed response.\n\n\u201cWe might be witnessing a huge battle within the DPS,\u201d wrote Kenneth Mueller, the district's director of student services. Hal Harrell, the superintendent, responds with a text to call him to \u201cplan this out.\u201d\n\nOn June 12, a fourth-grade teacher who was inside the school during the shooting told Harrell in an email that surviving staff members were being ignored by the district.\n\n\u201cI got to hear about the future of the school I love through a press conference,\u201d Deming wrote. She described taking students inside from recess when they heard gunshots and then bullets \u201ccame through my windows.\u201d\n\nDeming said she tried to lay in front of her students so that she could block them from the gunfire.\n\n\u201cI had shrapnel in my back from when he had shot in my window, I had blood all over the back of me, but I tried to stay calm for my students,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI needed my students to hear that they were loved in case it was the last thing they ever heard.\u201d\n\nJuan Lozano in Houston; John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas; Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia; Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington; and Jesse Bedayn in Denver contributed.",

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\nUVALDE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Nearly 400 law enforcement officials rushed to a mass shooting at a Uvalde elementary school, but \u201cegregiously poor decision-making\u201d resulted in more than an hour of chaos before the gunman who took 21 lives was finally confronted and killed, according to a damning investigative report released Sunday.\nThe nearly 80-page report was the first to criticize both state and federal law enforcement, and not just local authorities in the South Texas town for the bewildering inaction by heavily armed officers as a gunman fired inside two fourth-grade classrooms at Robb Elementary School, killing 19 students and two teachers.\nAltogether, the report and more than three hours of newly released body camera footage from the May 24 tragedy amounted to the fullest account to date of one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. Some families blasted police as cowards and demanded resignations.\n\u201cAt Robb Elementary, law enforcement responders failed to adhere to their active shooter training, and they failed to prioritize saving innocent lives over their own safety,\u201d the report said.\nThe gunman fired approximately 142 rounds inside the building \u2014 and it is \u201calmost certain\u201d that at least 100 shots came before any officer entered, according to the report, which laid out in detail numerous failures. Among them:\n\u2014 No one assumed command despite scores of officers being on the scene.\n\u2014 The commander of a Border Patrol tactical team waited for a bullet-proof shield and working master key for the classroom, which may have not even been needed, before entering the classroom.\n\u2014 A Uvalde Police Department officer said he heard about 911 calls that had come from inside the classroom, and that his understanding was the officers on one side of the building knew there were victims trapped inside. Still, no one tried to breach the classroom.\nThe report \u2014 the most complete account yet of the hesitant and haphazard response to the May 24 massacre \u2014 was written by an investigative committee from the Texas House of Representatives. Swiftly, the findings set in motion at least one fallout: Lt. Mariano Pargas, a Uvalde Police Department officer who was the city\u2019s acting police chief during the massacre, was placed on administrative leave.\nUvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said an investigation would be launched to determine whether Pargas should have taken command of the scene. He also disclosed for the first time that some officers had left the force since the shooting but did not provide an exact number, saying it was as many as three.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. They\u2019re a joke. They\u2019ve got no business wearing a badge. None of them do,\u201d Vincent Salazar, grandfather of 11-year-old Layla Salazar, who was among those killed, said Sunday.\nAnger flashed in Uvalde even over how the report was rolled out: Tina Quintanilla-Taylor, whose daughter survived the shooting, shouted at the three-member Texas House committee as they left a news conference after the findings were released.\nCommittee members had invited families of the victims to discuss the report privately, but Quintanilla-Taylor said the committee should have taken questions from the community, not just the media. \u201cI\u2019m pissed. They need to come back and give us their undivided attention,\u201d she said later.\n\u201cThese leaders are not leaders,\u201d she said.\nAccording to the report, 376 law enforcement officers massed at the school. The overwhelming majority of those who responded were federal and state law enforcement. That included nearly 150 U.S. Border Patrol agents and 91 state police officials.\n\u201cOther than the attacker, the Committee did not find any \u2018villains\u2019 in the course of its investigation,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere is no one to whom we can attribute malice or ill motives. Instead, we found systemic failures and egregiously poor decision making.\u201d\nThe report noted that many of the hundreds of law enforcement responders who rushed to the school were better trained and equipped than the school district police \u2014 which the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the state police force, previously faulted for not going into the room sooner.\nInvestigators said it was not their job to determine whether officers should be held accountable, saying that decisions rests with each law enforcement agency. Prior to Sunday, only one of the hundreds of officers on the scene \u2014 Pete Arredondo, the Uvalde school district police chief \u2014 was known to have been on leave.\n\u201cEveryone who came on the scene talked about this being chaotic,\u201d said Texas state Rep. Dustin Burrows, a Republican who led the investigation.\nOfficials with the Texas Department of Public Safety and U.S. Border Patrol did not immediately return requests for comment Sunday.\nThe report followed weeks of closed-door interviews with more than 40 people, including witnesses and law enforcement who were on the scene of the shooting.\nNo single officer has received as much scrutiny since the shooting as Arredondo, who also resigned from his newly appointed seat on the City Council after the shooting. Arredondo told the committee he treated the shooter as \u201cbarricaded subject,\u201d according to the report, and defended never treating the scene as an active-shooter situation because he did not have visual contact with the gunman.\nArredondo also tried to find a key for the classrooms, but no one ever bothered to see if the doors were locked, according to the report.\n\u201cArredondo\u2019s search for a key consumed his attention and wasted precious time, delaying the breach of the classrooms,\u201d the report read.\nThe report criticized as \u201clackadaisical\u201d the approach of the hundreds of officers who surrounded the school and said that they should have recognized that Arredondo remaining in the school without reliable communication was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with him being the scene commander. The report concluded that some officers waited because they relied on bad information while others \u201chad enough information to know better.\u201d\nHours after the report was released, Uvalde officials separately made public for the first time hours of body camera footage from the city\u2019s police officers who responded to the attack. It includes video of several officers reacting to word from a dispatcher, roughly 30 minutes after the shooting began, that a child in the room had called 911.\n\u201cThe room is full of victims. Child 911 call,\u201d an officer says.\nOther body camera video from Uvalde Staff Sgt.. Eduardo Canales, the head of the city\u2019s SWAT team, shows the officer approaching the classrooms when gunfire rings out at 11:37 a.m. Canales asks if he\u2019s bleeding, and later says he\u2019s bleeding from his ear.\nA minute later, Canales says: \u201cDude, we\u2019ve got to get in there. We\u2019ve got to get in there, he just keeps shooting. We\u2019ve got to get in there.\u201d Another officer can be heard saying \u201cDPS is sending their people.\u201d\nIt is 72 minutes later, at 12:50 p.m., when officers finally breach the classrooms and kill the shooter.\nCalls for police accountability have grown in Uvalde since the shooting.\nThe report is the result of one of several investigations into the shooting, including another led by the Justice Department. A report earlier this month by tactical experts at Texas State University alleged that a Uvalde police officer had a chance to stop the gunman before he went inside the school armed with an AR-15.\nBut in an example of the conflicting statements and disputed accounts since the shooting, McLaughlin has said that never happened. Officers told the committee that the person they thought was the gunman was actually a school coach.\nThe earlier report had been done at the request of the Texas Department of Public Safety, which McLaughlin has increasingly criticized and accused of trying to minimize the role of its troopers during the massacre. Steve McCraw, the head of Texas DPS, has called the police response an abject failure.\nThe committee didn\u2019t \u201creceive medical evidence\u201d to show that police breaching the classroom sooner would have saved lives, but it concluded that \u201cit is plausible that some victims could have survived if they had not had to wait 73 additional minutes for rescue.\u201d\nMichael Brown, whose 9-year-old son was in the cafeteria at Robb Elementary on the day of the shooting and survived, came to the committee\u2019s news conference Sunday carrying signs saying \u201c We Want Accountability\u201d and \u201cProsecute Pete Arredondo.\u201d\nBrown said he has not yet read the report but already knows enough to say that police \u201chave blood on their hands.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting. Disgusting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re cowards.\u201d\n___\nWeber reported from Austin, Texas.

My teacher is dead. Oh, my God.\u201d\nAt one point, the dispatcher asks Khloie if there are many people in the room with the 10-year-old, who ultimately survived.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just me and a couple of friends. A lot of people are,\u201d she says, pausing briefly, \u201cgone.\u201d\nCalls from Khloie and others, along with body camera footage and surveillance videos from the May 24, 2022, shooting at Robb Elementary School, were included in a massive collection of audio and video recordings released by Uvalde city officials on Saturday after a prolonged legal fight.\nThe Associated Press and other news organizations brought a lawsuit after the officials initially refused to publicly release the information. The massacre, which left 19 students and two teachers dead, was one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history.\nThe delayed law enforcement response to the shooting has been widely condemned as a massive failure: Nearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers. Families of the victims have long sought accountability for the slow police response in the South Texas city of about 15,000 people 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of San Antonio.\nBrett Cross\u2019 10-year-old nephew, Uziyah Garcia, was among those killed. Cross, who was raising the boy as a son, was angered that relatives weren\u2019t told the records were being released and that it took so long for them to be made public.\n\u201cIf we thought we could get anything we wanted, we\u2019d ask for a time machine to go back ... and save our children, but we can\u2019t, so all we are asking for is for justice, accountability and transparency, and they refuse to give this to us,\u201d he said.\nJesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jacklyn Cazares was killed in the shooting, said the release of information Saturday reignited festering anger because it shows \u201cthe waiting and waiting and waiting\u201d of law enforcement.\n\u201cPerhaps if they were to have breached earlier, they would have saved some lives, including my niece\u2019s,\u201d he said.\nThe police response included nearly 150 U.S. Border Patrol agents and 91 state police officials, as well as school and city police. While terrified students and teachers called 911 from inside classrooms, dozens of officers stood in the hallway trying to figure out what to do. Desperate parents who had gathered outside the building pleaded with them to go in.\nSound of 911 call on May 24th, 2022, from Armando Ramos, the uncle of the Uvalde school shooting suspect, asking the emergency dispatcher to let him speak with his nephew in the hopes of stopping the shooting.\nThe gunman, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, entered the school at 11:33 a.m., first opening fire from the hallway, then going into two adjoining fourth-grade classrooms. The first responding officers arrived at the school minutes later. They approached the classrooms, but then retreated as Ramos opened fire.\nAt 12:06 p.m., much of the radio traffic from the Uvalde Police Department was still focused on setting up a perimeter around the school and controlling traffic in the area, as well as the logistics of keeping track of those who safely evacuated the building. They\u2019ve had trouble setting up a command post, one officer tells his colleagues, \u201cbecause we need the bodies to keep the parents out.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to push in,\u201d he says.\nAt 12:16 p.m., someone with the Texas Department of Public Safety, the state law enforcement agency, called police to let them know a SWAT team was en route from Austin, about 162 miles (100 kilometers) away. She asked for any information the police could give about the shooting, the suspect and the police response.\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the frantic 911 calls during the Uvalde school shooting.\n\u201cDo you have a command post? Or where do you need our officers to go?\u201d the caller asks.\nThe police representative responds that officers know there are several dead students inside the elementary school and others still hiding. Some of the survivors have been evacuated to a building nearby. She doesn\u2019t know if a command post has been set up.\nAt 12:50 p.m., a tactical team enters one of the classrooms and fatally shoots Ramos.\nAmong criticisms included in a U.S. Justice Department report released earlier this year was that there was \u201cno urgency\u201d in establishing a command center, creating confusion among police about who was in charge.\nMultiple federal and state investigations have laid bare cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers.\nSome of the 911 calls released were from terrified instructors. One described \u201ca lot, a whole lot of gunshots,\u201d while another sobbed into the phone as a dispatcher urged her to stay quiet. \u201cHurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!\u201d the first teacher cried before hanging up.\nJust before arriving at the school, Ramos shot and wounded his grandmother at her home. He then took a pickup from the home and drove to the school.\nRamos\u2019 distraught uncle made several 911 calls begging to be put through so he could try to get his nephew to stop shooting.\n\u201cEverything I tell him, he does listen to me,\u201d Armando Ramos said. \u201cMaybe he could stand down or do something to turn himself in,\u201d he added, his voice cracking.\nHe said his nephew, who had been with him at his house the night before, stayed with him in his bedroom all night, and told him that he was upset because his grandmother was \u201cbugging\u201d him.\n\u201cOh my God, please, please, don\u2019t do nothing stupid,\u201d the man says on the call. \u201cI think he\u2019s shooting kids.\u201d\nBut the offer arrived too late, coming just around the time that the shooting had ended and law enforcement officers killed Salvador Ramos.\nTwo of the responding officers now face criminal charges. Former Uvalde school Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school officer Adrian Gonzales have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of child abandonment and endangerment. A Texas state trooper in Uvalde who had been suspended was reinstated to his job earlier this month.\nIn an interview this week with CNN, Arredondo said he thinks he\u2019s been \u201cscapegoated\u201d as the one to blame for the botched law enforcement response.\nSome of the families have called for more officers to be charged and filed federal and state lawsuits against law enforcement, social media, online gaming companies, and the gun manufacturer that made the rifle the gunman used.\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho; Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York; Jim Vertuno in Austin; David Fischer in Miami; Gabe Stern in Reno, Nevada; and Michael Balsamo and Julie Walker in New York contributed to this report."

During that time, terrified students in the classrooms called 911 and parents begged officers to go in. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the May 24, 2022, massacre in the rural South Texas town.\nAn earlier investigation by Texas lawmakers also constructed a timeline of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.\nHere is the Justice Department\u2019s reconstruction of the shooting, which is similar to timelines previously offered by authorities:\n11:21 a.m. \u2014 The gunman, Salvador Ramos, shoots and wounds his grandmother at their home, then sends a message to an acquaintance saying what he did and that he plans to \u201cshoot up an elementary school.\u201d\n11:28 a.m. \u2014 The gunman crashes a vehicle he stole from his grandparents\u2019 home into a ditch about 100 yards (90 meters) from Robb Elementary School.\n11:33 a.m. \u2014 He enters the school through a closed but unlocked door, walks to classrooms 111 and 112, and opens fire on their doors from the hallway. The two classrooms are connected by an interior door.\n11:36 a.m. \u2014 The first responding officers enter the school. The gunman is by now shooting inside the two fourth-grade classrooms. Two officers who run toward the classrooms are hit with shrapnel and retreat.\n11:38 a.m. \u2014 The first request to activate the Uvalde SWAT team is made over the radio.\n11:39 a.m. \u2014 A city police officer makes the first official request for shields. Officers in the hallway begin treating the gunman as a barricaded subject rather than an active shooter.\n11:40 a.m. to 12:21 p.m. \u2014 More officers from multiple law enforcement agencies arrive. During these 41 minutes, according to the report, \u201cthere is a great deal of confusion, miscommunication, a lack of urgency, and a lack of incident command.\u201d\n12:21 p.m. \u2014 The gunman fires four additional shots inside the classrooms. At this point, officers move into formation outside the classrooms\u2019 doors but don\u2019t enter. Officers then test keys on another door while searching for additional keys and breaching tools.\n12:48 p.m. \u2014 Officers open the door to room 111, which was likely unlocked. A minute or more goes by before the officers enter the room and engage the shooter.\n12:50 p.m. \u2014 The gunman is fatally shot by officers after he emerges from a closet while opening fire."

At the town civic center where some gathered, the silence was broken repeatedly by screams and wailing. \u201cNo! Please, no!\u201d one man yelled as he embraced another man.\n\u201cMy heart is broken today,\u201d said Hal Harrell, the school district superintendent. \u201cWe\u2019re a small community, and we\u2019re going to need your prayers to get through this.\u201d\nGov. Greg Abbott said one of the two adults killed was a teacher.\nAdolfo Cruz, a 69-year-old air conditioning repairman, was still outside the school as the sun set, seeking word on his 10-year-old great-granddaughter, Eliajha Cruz Torres.\nHe drove to the scene after receiving a terrifying call from his daughter shortly following the first reports of the shooting. He said other relatives were at the hospital and the civic center.\nWaiting, he said, was the heaviest moment of his life.\n\u201cI hope she is alive,\u201d Cruz said.\nThe attack was the latest grim moment for a country scarred by a string of massacres, coming just 10 days after a deadly, racist rampage at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. And the prospects for any reform of the nation\u2019s gun regulations seemed as dim, if not dimmer, than in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook deaths.\nBut President Joe Biden appeared ready for a fight, calling for new gun restrictions in an address to the nation hours after the attack.\n\u201cAs a nation we have to ask, when in God\u2019s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby? When in God\u2019s name are we going to do what has to be done?\u201d Biden asked. \u201cWhy are we willing to live with this carnage?\u201d\nIt was not immediately clear how many people in all were wounded, but Uvalde Police Chief Pete Arredondo said there were \u201cseveral injuries.\u201d\nStaff members in scrubs and devastated victims\u2019 relatives could be seen weeping as they walked out of Uvalde Memorial Hospital, which said 13 children were taken there. Another hospital reported a 66-year-old woman was in critical condition.\nOfficials did not immediately reveal a motive, but they identified the assailant as Salvador Ramos, a resident of the community about 85 miles (135 kilometers) west of San Antonio. Law enforcement officials said he acted alone.\nUvalde, home to about 16,000 people, is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from the border with Mexico. Robb Elementary, which has nearly 600 students in second, third and fourth grades, is in a mostly residential neighborhood of modest homes.\nThe attack came as the school was counting down to the last days of the school year with a series of themed days. Tuesday was to be \u201cFootloose and Fancy,\u201d with students wearing nice outfits.\nRamos had hinted on social media that an attack could be coming, according to state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who said he had been briefed by state police. He noted that the gunman \u201csuggested the kids should watch out,\u201d and that he had bought two \u201cassault weapons\u201d after turning 18.\nBefore heading to the school, Ramos shot his grandmother, Gutierrez said.\nOther officials said that the grandmother survived and was being treated, though her condition was not known.\nInvestigators believe Ramos posted photos on Instagram of two guns he used in the shooting, and they were examining whether he made statements online in the hours before the assault, a law enforcement official said.\nLaw enforcement officers were serving multiple search warrants Tuesday night and gathering telephone and other records, the official said. Investigators were also attempting to contact Ramos\u2019 relatives and were tracing the firearms.\nThe official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nThe attack began about 11:30 a.m., when the gunman crashed his car outside the school and ran into the building, according to Travis Considine, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. A resident who heard the crash called 911, and two local police officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter.\nBoth officers were shot. It was not immediately clear where on the campus that confrontation occurred or how much time elapsed before more authorities arrived on the scene.\nOne Border Patrol agent who was working nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school without waiting for backup and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade, according to a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it.\nThe agent was wounded but able to walk out of the school, the law enforcement official said.\nMeanwhile, teams of Border Patrol agents raced to the school, including 10 to 15 members of a SWAT-like tactical and counterterrorism unit, said Jason Owens, a top regional official with the Border Patrol.\nHe said some area agents have children at Robb Elementary.\n\u201cIt hit home for everybody,\u201d he said.\nCondolences poured in from leaders around the world. Pope Francis pleaded that it was time say \u201c\u2018enough\u2019 to the indiscriminate trade of weapons!\u201d Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba of Ukraine, which is at war with Russia after Moscow invaded, said that his nation also knows \u201cthe pain of losing innocent young lives.\u201d\nThe tragedy in Uvalde was the deadliest school shooting in Texas history, and it added to a grim tally in the state, which has been the site of some of the deadliest shootings in the U.S. over the past five years.\nIn 2018, a gunman fatally shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area. A year before that, a gunman at a Texas church killed more than two dozen people during a Sunday service in the small town of Sutherland Springs. In 2019, another gunman at a Walmart in El Paso killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanics.\nThe shooting came days before the National Rifle Association annual convention was set to begin in Houston. Abbott and both of Texas\u2019 U.S. senators were among elected Republican officials who were the scheduled speakers at a Friday leadership forum sponsored by the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm.\nIn the years since Sandy Hook, the gun control debate in Congress has waxed and waned. Efforts by lawmakers to change U.S. gun policies in any significant way have consistently faced roadblocks from Republicans and the influence of outside groups such as the NRA.\nA year after Sandy Hook, Sens. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, negotiated a bipartisan proposal to expand the nation\u2019s background check system. But the measure failed in a Senate vote, without enough support to clear a 60-vote filibuster hurdle.\nLast year, the House passed two bills to expand background checks on firearms purchases. One bill would have closed a loophole for private and online sales. The other would have extended the background check review period. Both languished in the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome objections from a filibuster.\n___\nThis story was first published on May 24, 2022. It was corrected to reflect that state Sen. Roland Gutierrez said the gunman shot his grandmother before going to the school; he did not say the gunman killed his grandmother. It was also updated to correct the spelling of the name of the 10-year-old great-granddaughter.\n___\nEugene Garcia and Dario Lopez-Mills in Uvalde, Jake Bleiberg in Dallas, Ben Fox, Michael Balsamo and Eric Tucker in Washington, Paul J.

      "text": "Appeals court orders release of Uvalde school shooting records\nA Texas state appeals court judge on Wednesday ordered Uvalde County and its school district to release records and documents related to the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, affirming a previous trial court order.\nA coalition of 18 news organizations, including The Texas Tribune, sued the City of Uvalde, Uvalde County and the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District in 2022 for access to body camera footage, 911 call records and communications made during the school shooting. Law enforcements\u2019 response to Texas\u2019 deadliest school shooting, in which 19 students and two teachers were killed, has been scrutinized extensively for failures in communication that delayed response time while the shooter was still in two classrooms with children.\nUvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell had opposed providing the records, pointing to criminal proceedings against former Uvalde school district Police Chief Pete Arredondo that she said could be hampered by the documents\u2019 release. But Judge Velia Meza with Texas\u2019 Fourth Court of Appeals wrote in the opinion for the case that the criminal proceedings and a separate lawsuit were not enough reasons to withhold the records.\n\u201cIn response, these entities offered only minimal justification \u2014 citing a grand jury investigation and a civil lawsuit \u2014 without providing legal or evidentiary support for withholding the information,\u201d Meza wrote.\nArredondo is facing several felony charges of child endangerment, with a trial date set for October.\nIn a statement, Laura Prather, a media law attorney with Haynes Boone representing the news organizations, said the ruling sends a clear message to government officials that \u201cvague legal claims\u201d cannot be used to withhold records.\n\u201cThe public has waited more than three years for answers about what went wrong that day,\u201d Prather said. \u201cThis decision brings us one step closer to those answers and preventing future tragedies.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Uvalde school district said its school board and superintendent have scheduled a discussion about the requested records during their public meeting on July 21. The Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not respond to a request for comment. The order from Meza did not specify when the records would need to be released.\n___\nThis story was originally published by The Texas Tribune and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press."

  "argos_summary": "The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District has released thousands of pages of documents related to the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, following a lengthy legal battle. The records include personnel files and communications that reveal the chaotic police response, which has been widely criticized for its delays and lack of urgency, with nearly 400 officers waiting over 70 minutes before confronting the gunman. Former police chief Pete Arredondo, who faces criminal charges for his actions during the incident, is highlighted in the documents, which also detail the gunman's troubled history leading up to the attack.",
