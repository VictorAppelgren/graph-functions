  "description": "Experts warn that the new regulations could make it more difficult for many Americans to find COVID-19 vaccines.",
  "content": "\u2022 Updated COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the FDA, but access is now limited to high-risk groups.\n\u2022 Federal guidelines now recommend the vaccine primarily for those over 65 and individuals with underlying health conditions.\n\u2022 Vaccines are available at various locations, but out-of-pocket costs may apply for those not considered high-risk.\n\nUpdated COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This season, there will be tighter restrictions around who can access them.\n\nHealth and Human Services Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the approval on social media platform X Aug. 27, stating that emergency-use authorizations for COVID vaccines have been terminated, with Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax immunizations approved for \"those at high risk.\"\n\nUpdated approvals mean that only those over 65 and people with existing health problems will be recommended for the vaccine under federal guidelines.\n\nHere's what else to know about COVID vaccines in the U.S. and North Carolina.\n\nIs the U.S. government banning vaccines?\n\nThe COVID vaccine will no longer be included in the immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. In accordance with its panel of outside experts, the CDC previously recommended updated COVID vaccines for everyone 6 months and older.\n\nThe White House dismissed claims that the HHS plans to ban the vaccine altogether as \"baseless speculation.\" However, experts warn that it could become more difficult for many Americans to access the vaccines, as insurance companies general follow federal regulations.\n\nWho can get a COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe HHS told USA TODAY in a Q&A document that the decision to change vaccine guidelines \"does not affect access to these vaccines for healthy individuals,\" with shots remaining available to \"those who choose them in consultation with their healthcare provider.\"\n\n\"The transition is from a circumstance where vaccines have been marketed under both the emergency use pathway and the traditional approval pathway, to a circumstance where the COVID-19 vaccines are now marketed only under the traditional approval pathway,\" the document said. \"This is not a removal of COVID-19 vaccines from the market.\"\n\nWhile the changes are not a ban on the vaccines, experts warn that COVID vaccines could become more difficult to obtain for many, as insurance companies generally follow federal regulations.\n\nPfizer's updated shot was approved for use in all adults 65 and older and people older than 5 with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for experiencing severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nModerna's updated Spikevax formula was approved for everyone over 65 and people 6 months and older with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk. Its new vaccine, mNEXSPIKE, was approved for people with an underlying condition ages 12 years or older and everyone over 65.\n\nWhere to get a COVID-19 vaccine in North Carolina\n\nVaccines are available at doctor's offices or clinics, local health departments, and some local pharmacies. You can find the administrator closest to you online at covid19.ncdhhs.gov/vaccines.\n\nU.S. residents should keep in mind that under the new regulations many people under 65 will have to pay out of pocket for the shot. The NCDHHS COVID vaccine webpage also provides a list of assistance options for uninsured residents at covid19.ncdhhs.gov/vaccines#paying-for-vaccines.\n\nWhere to get tested for COVID-19 in North Carolina\n\nHome-tests are available online and at many pharmacies throughout North Carolina. Residents can also contact a doctor or primary healthcare provider, pharmacy, tribal or community health center to see if they offer testing.\n\nAdditionally, the NC Department of Health and Human Services partners with local Community Access Points to distribute free home-tests at a number of locations throughout the state.

      "text": "Tennessee hiker dies from rattlesnake bite; same species lives in Western NC\n- A Tennessee hiker died after being bitten by a timber rattlesnake.\n- North Carolina has three types of rattlesnakes, including the timber rattlesnake.\n- Copperhead bites are the most common type of venomous snake bite in North Carolina.\nOn Aug. 15, ABC reported that a Tennessee hiker died of a snakebite received while walking on a state park trail.\nThe hiker reportedly picked up the snake while hiking at Savage Gulf State Park and was bitten on the hand. He died shortly after being admitted to the hospital. A timber rattlesnake is thought to be the species behind the deadly snakebite. In addition to being present in Tennessee, it is one of five venomous breeds also found in North Carolina.\nWhile timber rattlesnakes are far less common than copperheads, which are reportedly behind 10 times more calls to NC Poison Control than any other snake, they are one of two venomous snake breeds found in Western N.C.\nHere's what to know about N.C.'s rattlesnakes and other venomous snake species.\nAre there rattlesnakes in North Carolina?\nThere are three varieties of rattlesnake found in N.C. Timber rattlesnakes, the breed of snake responsible for the recent deadly snakebite in Tennessee, are one such breed, and are one of two venomous snake varieties found in the WNC region along with copperheads.\nTimber rattlesnakes vary in size and color, but can be recognized by their dark banded pattern on lighter skin, as well as the rattle at the end of its tail. NC Poison Control says that coastal varieties generally have a brown or orange stripe down the middle of their backs.\nOther N.C. rattlesnake breeds include:\n- Carolina pigmy rattlesnakes, which live mainly in pine flatwoods and scrub oak habitats in southeastern Coastal Plain, Sandhills and a few portions of the southern Piedmont. Pigmy rattlesnakes are around 1-2 feet in length with dark gray spotted patterns on gray, pink or red skin.\n- Eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, found in sandy, coastal areas in southeast N.C. Diamondbacks can measure up to 6 feet in length and can be dark gray or olive green with distinctive diamond-shaped markings on their backs. Other distinctive markings include black bands outlined by two pale lines that cover the snakes' eye areas.\nWhat to do if you're bitten by a rattlesnake\nRattlesnake bites are serious - call 911 right away if bitten. Mayo Clinic adds that after calling 911, you should take the following steps if possible:\n- Move far away from the snake\n- Stay still and calm\n- Remove any jewelry, watches or tight clothing before swelling starts\n- Sit or lie down so that the bite is in a neutral, comfortable position\n- Clean the bite with soap and water, cover or wrap it loosely with a clean, dry bandage\n- In order to help medical professionals with treatment, try to remember the color and shape of the snake so that you can describe it or take a picture of the snake from a safe distance if possible\nThings to avoid after being bitten include:\n- Don't tie off the bite area\n- Don't apply ice\n- Don't cut the bite or try to remove the venom in any other way\n- Don't drink caffeine or alcohol\n- Don't take pain-relieving medicine, such as aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen sodium, as doing so can increase your risk of bleeding\n- Don't try to catch or trap the snake\nWhat to do if you're bitten by a copperhead snake\nCopperheads are by far the most common venomous snake in N.C. - NC Poison Control receives about 10 times more calls about copperheads than any other snake.\nThe good news that many aren't aware of is that copperhead bites, while very painful, often pose very little risk. In fact, Poison Control says that about half of all bites result only in pain and mild swelling. As in the case of any venomous snakebite, however, a 911 call or emergency room visit is still warranted following a bite from a copperhead.\nWhat types of venomous snakes live in North Carolina?\nNC Poison Control states that five species of venomous snakes cause the majority of snake bites reported. These venomous species include:\n- Copperhead\n- Cottonmouth (also known as \"water moccasin\")\n- Eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n- Pigmy rattlesnake\n- Timber rattlesnake\nPrevious reporting from the Citizen Times covered descriptions of each breed, including territories, appearances, bite severity and more.\nIris Seaton is the trending news reporter for the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "- In late August 2025, social media posts claimed U.S. President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. planned to ban the COVID-19 vaccine \"within months.\"\n- The rumor stemmed from a report published by The Daily Beast on Aug. 25, 2025, that cited Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist and close associate of Kennedy.\n- Snopes was unable to independently verify the details in The Daily Beast's article.\n- An HHS spokesperson told us the agency cannot comment on potential policy decisions. The White House did not respond to our request for comment by the time of publication. However, a White House spokesperson told The Daily Beast that \"any discussion about HHS policy should be dismissed as baseless speculation\" unless it's announced by the Trump administration.\n- It's unclear exactly what would happen if the Trump administration does move to pull COVID-19 vaccines from the market. However, some public-health experts say such a move would likely face significant legal hurdles.\nIn late August 2025, social media posts claimed U.S. President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. planned to ban the COVID-19 vaccine \"within months.\"\nMany of the posts sharing the claim cited the news outlet Newsweek.\n\"BREAKING: President Trump and HHS Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are allegedly planning to ban the COVID vaccine 'within months,' according to an associate of Kennedy's, per Newsweek,\" one Aug. 25 X post (archived) read.\nMultiple X users shared the same claim (archived here, here and here). Snopes readers also emailed us and searched our website to verify whether Trump and Kennedy were really planning to ban the COVID-19 vaccine.\nThe claim stemmed from a report (archived) published by The Daily Beast on Aug. 25 that cited Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist and close associate of Kennedy. Newsweek published its own article (archived) on the same day, citing The Daily Beast's reporting.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told Snopes the agency cannot comment on potential policy decisions. The White House did not respond to our request for comment by the time of publication. We will update this report should we receive more information.\nWhat the Daily Beast report says\nThe Daily Beast quoted Malhotra as saying the Trump administration would move to pull the COVID-19 vaccine off the U.S. market \"within months.\" The report did not provide a specific timeline for the alleged move.\nMalhotra serves as the chief medical adviser for Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) Action, a\nAccording to The Daily Beast, Malhotra reportedly said \"influential\" members of Trump's family share Kennedy's stance, seemingly referring to efforts to remove the COVID-19 vaccine from the market. Malhotra also reportedly told The Daily Beast that many people close to Kennedy have told him they \"cannot understand\" why the vaccine continues to be prescribed.\nOn the process of potentially pulling the vaccine from the market, The Daily Beast quoted Malhotra as saying:\nIt could [happen] in a number of stages, including learning more about the data. But given the increased talk of vaccine injuries in the past few weeks among the administration, it could also come with one clean decision.\nHowever, Snopes was unable to independently verify the details in The Daily Beast's article.\nWe reached out to Malhotra to ask whether he could provide any documentation or evidence confirming that discussions about pulling the COVID-19 vaccine off the market had taken place, and whether Trump or any members of his team have communicated with him about such plans. We did not receive a response by the time of publication.\nWe sent similar questions to MAHA Action and await a response.\nKush Desai, a White House spokesperson, provided the following statement to The Daily Beast:\nThe Administration is relying on Gold Standard Science and is committed to radical transparency to make decisions that affect all Americans. Unless announced by the Administration, however, any discussion about HHS policy should be dismissed as baseless speculation.\nCould Trump unilaterally 'ban' a vaccine?\nIt's unclear exactly what would happen if the Trump administration does move to pull COVID-19 vaccines from the market. However, some public health experts say such a move would likely face significant legal hurdles.\nAccording to The New York Times, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally ban certain vaccines. Public health authority lies primarily with the states, not the federal government, and vaccines themselves are licensed and regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as the newspaper noted.\nLawrence O. Gostin, an expert in public health law at Georgetown University, told the Times that a president's attempt to unilaterally remove a lawful product from the market would likely trigger a legal fight.\nExperts with KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, shared (archived) a similar sentiment about potential legal issues. They explained that the FDA can remove vaccines from the market in the event of serious safety concerns or other issues, and that the agency follows a formal process for doing so.\nRemoving an approved vaccine without compelling new evidence of harm or other concerns would likely lead to legal challenges, the KFF experts said.\nWind-down of mRNA vaccine development\nThe Daily Beast's report was published after HHS announced (archived) in early August 2025 that it would wind down its mRNA vaccine development efforts under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nThe move included ending 22 mRNA vaccine development projects worth nearly $500 million, according to the agency.\nKennedy said the decision was based on data that shows the vaccines fail to effectively protect against respiratory infections like COVID-19, a claim health experts have disputed.\nSome final-stage mRNA contracts will continue in order to \"preserve prior taxpayer investment,\" but \"no new mRNA-based projects will be initiated,\" HHS said. Other uses of mRNA technology within the department were not affected by the announcement, the agency said.\nPublic health experts have openly criticized the agency's decision, warning it will undermine preparedness for future emerging diseases and the next pandemic."

      "text": "US News & World Report high school rankings are in. See all Western NC public high schools\n- U.S. News & World Report released its 2025 \"Best High Schools in North Carolina\" rankings.\n- Rankings are based on college readiness, state assessment proficiency, underserved student performance, college curriculum breadth, and graduation rate.\n- Nesbitt Discovery Academy in Asheville ranked #7 in the state.\n- Over 50 Western North Carolina high schools were included in the rankings.\nWhere do public high schools in Western North Carolina rank among all high schools in the the state this year? U.S. News & World Report's yearly \"Best High Schools in North Carolina\" report for 2025 has arrived.\nKey factors were used to determine each high school's placement, such as college readiness, state assessment proficiency, and underserved student performance. Of 24,000 U.S. public high schools, 587 NC schools made this year's U.S. News rankings - including one WNC high school among the state's top 10.\nHere's how U.S. News ranked more than 50 WNC high schools for the 2025-2026 school year, plus the state's top 10 overall and more.\nHow does US News & World Report rank schools?\nSix main factors go into high school rankings from US News:\n- College readiness (30%) - The proportions of 12th graders who took and earned a qualifying score on at least one AP or IB exam. Earning a qualifying score is worth three times more than just taking.\n- State assessment proficiency (20%) - Aggregated scores on state assessments that students may be required to pass for graduation.\n- State assessment performance (20%) - How aggregated scores on state assessments compare with U.S. News' expectations given the proportions of students who are Black, Hispanic and from low-income households.\n- Underserved student performance (10%) - Scores on state assessments aggregated just among students who are Black, Hispanic and from low-income households. These scores are compared with what is typical in the state for non-underserved students, with parity or higher being the goal.\n- College curriculum breadth (10%) - The proportions of 12th graders who took and earned a qualifying score on AP and IB exams in multiple areas. More exams are valued more than fewer exams up to a maximum of four. Earning a qualifying score on an exam is worth three times more than taking.\n- Graduation rate (10%) - The proportion of entering ninth graders who graduated four academic years later.\nWhere did Asheville City Schools high schools rank on US News & World Report NC list?\n- No. 64 - School of Inquiry and Life Sciences\n- No. 103 - Asheville High School\nWhere did Buncombe County Schools rank on US News & World Report NC list?\n- No. 7 - Nesbitt Discovery Academy\n- No. 102 - Reynolds High School\n- No. 153 - Owen High School\n- No. 154 - Roberson High School\n- No. 159 - Enka High School\n- No. 163 - North Buncombe High School\n- No. 252 - Early College\n- No. 433 - Buncombe County Schools Virtual Academy\n- Unranked - Community High School, Middle College\nWhere did other WNC schools rank on US News & World Report NC list?\n- No. 74 - Watauga High School\n- No. 75 - Hendersonville High School\n- No. 104 - Henderson County Early College\n- No. 106 - West Henderson High School\n- No. 107 - Brevard High School\n- No. 118 - Mountain Heritage High School\n- No. 127 - Robbinsville High School\n- No. 168 - Haywood Early College\n- No. 184 - McDowell Early College\n- No. 185 - Tuscola High School\n- No. 189 - R-S Central High School\n- No. 198 - Chase High School\n- No. 199 - Polk County High School\n- No. 204 - McDowell Academy for Innovation\n- No. 218 - Rutherford Early College High School\n- No. 240 - North Henderson High School\n- No. 244 - East Rutherford High School\n- No. 246 - Murphy High School\n- No. 247 - Hayesville High School\n- No. 249 - Jackson County Early College\n- No. 260 - Watauga Innovation Academy\n- No. 276 - Mayland Early College\n- No. 278 - Polk County Early College\n- No. 283 - Macon Early College High School\n- No. 286 - Franklin High School\n- No. 302 - Tri-County Early College High School\n- No. 304 - Highlands School\n- No. 305 - Smoky Mountain High School\n- No. 318 - Madison Early College High School\n- No. 328 - East Henderson High School\n- No. 334 - Rosman High School\n- No. 373 - Mitchell High School\n- No. 384 - Avery County High School\n- No. 395 - Madison High School\n- No. 414 - Swain County High School\n- No. 446 - Andrews High School\n- No. 447 - Robbinsville High School\n- No. 463-587 - Blue Ridge Early College, Hiwassee Dam High School, McDowell High School, McDowell Virtual Academy\nWhat are the top rated NC high schools on US News & World Report?\nThe top 10 NC high schools on the report this year:\n- The Early College at Guilford, Greensboro\n- STEM Early College at N.C.

      "text": "Want a COVID vaccine? It could cost you $200.\nTrump administration COVID-19 vaccine policy changes mean anyone who is healthy and under 65 will likely have to pay out of pocket, including pregnant women.\nMost Americans have decided they're done getting vaccinated against COVID-19, but there are still reasons to consider it, and it remains an essential protection for some.\nThat's why some doctors and medical organizations are concerned about changes to the vaccine recommendations made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nUnder the changes Kennedy announced in a social media post May 27, in addition to those announced a week prior by his appointees, the only people who will be recommended for COVID-19 vaccines are those over 65 and people with existing health problems.\nThese changes, which bypassed the normal scientific review process, may make it harder for others who want the COVID-19 vaccine to get it, including health care workers and healthy people under 65 with a vulnerable family member or those who want to reduce their short-term risk of infection.\nKennedy specifically changed the recommendations so pregnant women and healthy children aren't included, though it's not clear if that's just for booster shots or whether it would also include a baby's first COVID-19 vaccine.\nInsurance coverage typically follows federal recommendations, so anyone who is healthy and under 65 is likely to have to pay out of pocket to get the shot \u2012 which runs about $200 \u2012 if they can get it. It's not clear what insurance companies will do about the new recommendations.\nKennedy did not explain a reasoning behind the change, though he has complained in the past about the quality of studies used to justify previous recommendations.\nLimiting access in this way, several medical experts said, contradicts Kennedy's previous statements about how he'd handle vaccines. It also runs counter to the general practice of medicine, which supports people making medical decisions in collaboration with their doctor, they said.\n\"I think we can treat people respectfully and show them the information and let them make their own decisions,\" said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University.\nHe and others said they're especially concerned that these policy changes are happening without supporting data or the typical scientific review by two panels of experts.\n\"We haven't been presented with one shred of information to show that this step is needed at this time,\" Goodman said. \"If it is, fine, but present that publicly, use the advisory committees and let's have a transparent process.\"\nWho still needs a vaccine?\nThe federal government has stopped tracking COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths, but local data shows they are still happening in every age group, with two-thirds of hospitalizations in people 65 years and older.\nMeanwhile, safety data on the vaccines continues to show that serious side effects are extremely rare, leading many specialists and expert organizations to conclude that it's still worthwhile to get the vaccine.\nWhile the vaccine is most important for people in vulnerable groups, such as those over 65 and people with health conditions, a booster remains useful for everyone, even children, several experts and disease organizations told USA TODAY.\n\"What is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,\" Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.\nShould children get the COVID-19 vaccine?\nHealthy kids will no longer be recommended for COVID-19 vaccines, according to Kennedy's policy announcement.\nFewer than 5% of children received the COVID-19 vaccine between the fall of 2023 and the fall of 2024, data shows. Yet COVID-19 continues to lead to about as many hospitalizations in children as the flu, at about 100 hospitalizations for every 100,000 kids under 4.\nOn balance, the vaccine still provides a benefit, said Dr. Melissa Stockwell, division chief of child and adolescent health at Columbia University. \"The point of a booster is to give protection against whatever the current circulating variant is and shorter-term protection against infection, but what we're really looking for is protection against severe outcomes,\" Stockwell said.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine has repeatedly been found to be safe in most children, though vaccines like medications can always have some rare risks. Most notably with the original COVID-19 vaccine schedule, adolescent boys and young men were at somewhat higher risk for a rare heart problem known as myocarditis that is also a risk of COVID infection itself. Stockwell said she and others haven't seen myocarditis since the early days of vaccination when the initial two doses were given relatively close together.\nWhat remains unclear \u2012 and of much higher concern to pediatricians and infectious disease experts \u2012 is whether Kennedy's new policy covers all shots or just boosters. Children between 6 months and 2 years are at high risk for severe COVID-19 because they've not been exposed to it before, just as everyone was at higher risk when the virus was new.\nAnd vaccination reduces the risk for long COVID, in which symptoms can linger for months or even years after a COVID-19 infection. Stockwell, who said her own children are vaccinated, cited research showing that vaccines reduce the risk of long COVID in children by 40%.\nA new study in JAMA Pediatrics shows that children younger than two who had been infected with COVID were more likely to experience trouble sleeping, fussiness, poor appetite, a stuffy nose and cough, while preschoolers, age 3 to 5, who had been infected were more likely to have low energy, daytime tiredness and a dry cough than children who avoided infection.\nThe study found that roughly 1 in 7 previously infected children meet the criteria for long COVID.\n\"For parents who want their children to be vaccinated, we want them to have that opportunity,\" Stockwell said.\nIs it risky to skip COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy?\nThe new policy removes the recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. This concerns a number of obstetricians, infectious disease specialists and pediatricians.\nPregnant women are at high risk for severe disease and studies show that the likelihood of miscarriage, stillbirth and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia, blood clots, heart and kidney damage and hypertension are much higher among women who develop COVID-19 during pregnancy.\nNewborns are also at high risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. Any respiratory infection is more dangerous in newborns than in others, because their airways are so small. Plus, they have never been exposed to COVID-19 before. Vaccinating during pregnancy protects newborns until they are old enough to get their own shot, Stockwell said.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine has also been shown to be extremely safe during pregnancy and far safer than a COVID-19 infection.\nThe Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, which has expertise in high-risk pregnancy, issued a statement saying the society \"strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\"\nThe COVID-19 vaccine, the society said, \"is safe to be given at any point during pregnancy. Maternal immunization is also associated with improved infant outcomes and decreased complications, including maternal and infant hospitalizations. \"\nWhat's the process for changing vaccine recommendations?\nChanges to the vaccine schedule are typically made after federal officials solicit recommendations from two panels of experts in infectious disease, pediatrics and other relevant specialties. The heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration then review the decisions of their respective panels and issue a joint recommendation.\nKennedy's decision breaks with this practice.\n\"It can be confusing to families, particularly when there's conflicting information about vaccination,\" Stockwell said.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics also raised concerns about Kennedy's disregard for the normal procedure of changing vaccine recommendations. In his brief comments on social media on May 27, he didn't mention consulting any doctors or panels.\n\"This decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall,\" Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.\n\"By removing the recommendation, the decision could strip families of choice. Those who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage remain unclear,\" he said.\nIn the wake of Kennedy's statement, the Infectious Disease Society of America urged insurers to continue to cover the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone, including the groups Kennedy said the government would no longer recommend get the shot.\n\"IDSA strongly urges insurers to maintain coverage for COVID-19 vaccines so that all Americans can make the best decisions to protect themselves and their families against severe illness, hospitalization and death,\" society president Dr. Tina Tan said in a statement. \"IDSA also urges Congress to conduct meaningful and necessary oversight to ensure appropriate decision-making processes at the Department of Health and Human Services, which will impact people of all ages.\"\nIsn't this what RFK Jr. said he'd do?\nMonths ago, in the lead up to his confirmation, Kennedy told at least one senator that he would follow CDC guidance and the advisory committees' recommendations about vaccines.\nSen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and physician, said Kennedy assured him he would adhere to expert guidance on vaccinations.\nHe spoke from the floor of the Senate in support of Kennedy, explaining to his colleagues that Kennedy \"has also committed that he would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems.\"\n\"If confirmed,\" Cassidy told them, \"he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.\"\nContributed: Adrianna Rodriguez"

Accessed: August 21, 2025. |\nU.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nINDICATION\nCOMIRNATY (COVID-19 VACCINE, mRNA) is a vaccine to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nCOMIRNATY is for people who are:\n- 65 years of age and older, or\n- 5 years through 64 years of age with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n- You or your child should NOT get COMIRNATY \u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) if you or your child had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of COMIRNATY or any Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or to any ingredient in these vaccines\n- There is a remote chance that COMIRNATY could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose. For this reason, the vaccination provider may ask you or your child to stay at the place where you or your child received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include:\n- Difficulty breathing\n- Swelling of the face and throat\n- A fast heartbeat\n- A bad rash all over the body\n- Dizziness and weakness\n- Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including COMIRNATY and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis and pericarditis following administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have occurred most commonly in males 12 years through 24 years of age. In most of these people, symptoms began within a week following vaccination. You should seek medical attention right away if you or your child have any of the following symptoms after receiving the COMIRNATY, particularly during the 2 weeks after receiving a dose of the vaccine:\n- Chest pain\n- Shortness of breath\n- Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart\n- Additional symptoms, particularly in children, may include:\n- Fainting\n- Unusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energy\n- Persistent vomiting\n- Persistent pain in the abdomen\n- Unusual and persistent cool, pale skin\n- Fainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines including COMIRNATY. Your vaccination provider may ask you to sit or lie down\n- People with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response to COMIRNATY\n- Vaccination with COMIRNATY may not protect all people who receive the vaccine\nBefore getting COMIRNATY, tell your vaccination provider about all of your or your child\u2019s medical conditions, including if you or your child:\n- have any allergies\n- had a severe allergic reaction after receiving a previous dose of any COVID-19 vaccine\n- have had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart)\n- have a fever\n- have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner\n- are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system\n- are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding\n- have received another COVID-19 vaccine\n- have ever fainted in association with an injection\nAdditional side effects that have been reported with COMIRNATY or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines include:\n- Non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face\n- Injection site reactions: pain, swelling, redness, arm pain\n- General side effects: tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, feeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness\n- Febrile seizures (convulsions during a fever) in children 5 through 11 years of age\nThese may not be all the possible side effects of COMIRNATY. Ask your or your child\u2019s healthcare provider about any side effects that concern you.\nYou may report side effects to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1\u2010800\u2010822\u20107967 or report online to www.vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.\nIn addition, you can report side effects to Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or www.pfizersafetyreporting.com\nPlease click here for full Prescribing Information and Patient Information for COMIRNATY.\nAbout Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients\u2019 Lives\nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

      "text": "Human screwworm case reported in the US: Here's what NC residents should know\n- A U.S. patient in Maryland was diagnosed with New World screwworm after traveling to El Salvador.\n- The New World screwworm, eradicated from the U.S. in the 1960s, is a parasitic fly whose larvae infest living tissue.\nA U.S. patient was diagnosed with New World screwworm, which is rare in humans. Are North Carolina residents safe?\nAn outbreak of NWS is underway in Central America according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is currently executing plans to combat New World screwworms as the parasite moves farther north into southern Mexico, aiming to protect Texas's cattle industry.\nHHS spokesperson Andrew G. Nixon said the human case reported in the U.S. was related to this outbreak. The case was reported in a Maryland patient who recently visited El Salvador. Nixon said that it remains an isolated case.\n\"The risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low,\" Nixon said.\nThe parasite was eradicated the the U.S. by 1966, according to the U.S. Congress. The Maryland Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the parasite as a travel-related New World screwworm case on Aug. 4.\nHere's what N.C. residents should know about New World screwworm.\nWhat is a New World screwworm?\nThe USDA describes New World screwworms as \"devastating pests.\" When NWS fly larvae - maggots - burrow into the flesh of living animals, they cause damage that can often prove deadly. NWS infests livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\nThe CDC explains that NWS infestation is a type of myiasis - an infection of fly larva in tissue - caused when a screwworm burrows or \"screws\" into healthy tissue and lays eggs. The wound can become larger and deeper as more larvae hatch and feed on living tissue, eventually causing serious damage.\nHow is screwworm treated in humans?\nThe only way to treat NWS infection is to physically remove larvae from infested tissue. The CDC adds that all suspected NWS larvae removed should be \"collected and placed into a leak-proof container with 70% ethanol,\" fully submerging the larvae in order to kill and preserve them for examination.\nWhile there are anecdotal reports of using ivermectin off-label to treat NWS infestation in humans, the CDC states that there are no \"controlled, double-blind studies measuring the impact of ivermectin use on myiasis,\" meaning that this treatment method has no scientific basis.\nWhere is the U.S. human screwworm case?\nThe human case of New World screwworm occurred in a Maryland patient who recently returned from travel to El Salvador, Nixon told Reuters in an email.\nOn Aug. 4, the Maryland Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the parasite as a New World screwworm, but said the case was isolated and travel-related.\nAre there screwworms in North Carolina?\nFederal officials say the health risk to the U.S. public is quite low and the Maryland case is related to travel from an outbreak zone in Central America.\nNC State University researchers explain that the New World screwworm is a type of blowfly, and looks very similar to some blowflies found in N.C. However, N.C. blowflies lay eggs only in dead animals, meaning that they are ecologically important and pose no danger to humans.\nThere have been no reported human or animal cases of New World screwworm in N.C. in 2025.\nWhen was New World screwworm last reported in US, Central America?\nThe fly was eradicated in the U.S. in the 1960s and in Mexico in the 1970s. In the 20th century, the U.S. eliminated the screwworm by using planes to drop boxes of the sterile flies over hotspots, according to Reuters.\nThe USDA states that, in 2023, NWS detections in Panama rose from an average of 25 cases per year to more than 6,500. Since 2023, screwworm has been detected in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Mexico.\nWhat is the US doing to prevent screwworms from returning?\nIn June, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced USDA\u2019s latest plans to build and operate an $8.5 million domestic New World screwworm sterile fly dispersal facility at the Moore Air Base, located just 20 miles from the Mexico border in Edinburg, Texas, the Michigan Farm Bureau reported.\nRollins said the facility will be completed by the end of 2025, allowing USDA to aerially disperse sterile male flies at the border and northern Mexico to mate with wild female flies, resulting in no offspring.\n\u201cThe United States has defeated NWS before and we will do it again,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cWe do not take lightly the threat NWS poses to our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d\nReuters, Jenna Prestininzi, USA TODAY network, contributed."

      "text": "RFK Jr. ditches COVID vaccine recommendation for children, pregnant women\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on May 27 that the COVID-19 vaccine would no longer be included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, in a move that breaks with previous expert guidance.\nHe announced the change in a video clip on X, arguing that it\u2019s \u201ccommon sense and it\u2019s good science.\u201d The clip also featured Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.\nTraditionally, the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices would meet and vote on changes to the immunization schedule or recommendations on who should get vaccines before the director of the CDC makes a final call. The committee has not voted on the changes Kennedy announced.\nThe CDC, following its panel of outside experts, previously recommended updated COVID-19 vaccines for everyone aged six months and older.\nThe change comes after the Food and Drug Administration said on May 20 it plans to require new clinical trials for approval of the annual COVID-19 boosters for healthy individuals under the age of 65.\nFor years, Kennedy has questioned the effectiveness or safety of several vaccines and promoted debunked claims that certain vaccines are linked to autism.\n'Turned upside down'\n\"The recommendation is coming down from the secretary, so the process has just been turned upside down,\" said William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a consultant to the ACIP.\nSchaffner said the CDC's panel was to vote on these issues at a June meeting, where he had expected them to favor more targeted shots instead of a universal vaccine recommendation. \"But this seems to be a bit preemptory,\" he said.\nDorit Reiss, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco, said in a Facebook post that going around the advisory committee might hurt the agency in the case of potential litigation.\nStudies with hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby, according to the CDC's website.\nBut Makary said in the video that there was no evidence that healthy children need routine COVID shots. Most countries have stopped recommending it for children, he added.\nContributing: Reuters"

Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n- The Supreme Court will consider the case in conference on Sept. 29, 2025.\n- The Respect for Marriage Act, signed in 2022, requires states to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages, offering some federal protection even if Obergefell is overturned.\n- Legal experts believe the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has been officially asked to overturn the 2015 decision that granted equal rights for LGBTQ+ couples to be married.\nOn Jan. 16, 2015, ruling on the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court case legalized same-sex marriage countrywide. A summary of the case from Supreme.Justia.com described marriage laws that previously banned same-sex marriage as a burden on the liberty of same-sex couples, humiliating and harmful to their children and abridging central precepts of equality.\nOn July 24, former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges. Though the request has made headlines, many uncertainties remain. Here's what we do know about potential changes to the legality of same-sex marriage as of 2025.\nSame-sex marriage Supreme Court case; what we know\nThough the case has been formally filed with the Supreme Court, it won't necessarily be decided by justices. The case will be considered at the justices' conference on Sept. 29 - this means a decision on whether the court will hear the case will arrive in October 2025 at the earliest.\nIn previous reporting from USA TODAY, legal experts told reporters that the court is unlikely to overturn the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges. Additionally, the Respect for Marriage Act signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, which passed through Congress with bipartisan support, requires all states to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages. The act would provide some federal protection to same-sex marriages even if Obergefell v. Hodges was overturned.\nWho asked the Supreme Court to overturn same-sex marriage?\nFormer Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis filed an appeal on July 24 about the compensation she was ordered to pay to a gay couple she denied a marriage license. She asked the court, which currently holds a conservative supermajority, to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.\nDoes Trump support same-sex marriage?\nPresident Donald Trump has given a wide range of answers to the question of his stance on same-sex marriage over the years. As of mid-August 2025, the White House has not weighed in on the appeal request.\nWhile Trump has made several statements disapproving of same-sex marriage - such as a 2011 statement on Fox News that he was not \"in favor of gay marriage\" - he has also made comments to the contrary, such as stating he was \"fine\" with same-sex marriage days after being elected in 2016 in a \"60 Minutes\" interview.\nThroughout his first term and reelection campaign, Trump appointed people with histories of advocating against same-sex marriage, including Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, according to GLAAD.\nDuring Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, the GOP's official platform removed explicit mentions of same-sex marriage, instead stating \"Republicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage, the blessings of childhood, the foundational role of families, and supports working parents.\"\nNorth Carolina same-sex marriage laws\nAs of 2025, same-sex marriage is legal in NC due to Obergefell v. Hodges.

      "text": "Can you text at a red light in NC? What drivers should know about cellphones on NC roads\n- As of 2025, Montana is the only state without a texting-while-driving ban.\n- North Carolina prohibits manually entering text and reading messages while driving, except for caller ID.\n- Even at a red light, using a cellphone while the engine is running is illegal in North Carolina.\nAs of 2025, Montana is the only U.S. state with no ban on texting and driving. When it comes to other types of phone usage by a vehicle operator, however, lines in many states are a bit more blurred.\nNorth Carolina's statute N.C.G.S. 20-137.4A states that anyone operating a vehicle on a public street or highway is legally prohibited from:\n- Manually entering multiple letters or text in a device as a means of communicating with another person\n- Reading any electronic mail or text messages transmitted to a device or stored within a device (other than names or numbers stored in the device for caller identification)\nThe definition of \"operating a vehicle,\" however, may not be exactly what you would expect. Here's what N.C. drivers should know about cellphone traffic laws in the state, from definitions to penalties and beyond.\nWhat is the 'No Touch Law?'\n\"No Touch Law\" refers to a law that bans the use of mobile device while driving. These laws are also referred to as \"distracted driving\" or \"hands-free\" laws.\nCan you use your phone at a red light in NC?\nAs per N.C.'s statute N.C.G.S. 20-137.4A, the operator of a vehicle is defined as \"a person in actual control of a vehicle which has the engine running.\" This means that even while temporarily stopped at a red light, it is illegal for a driver to use a cellphone.\nN.C. does allow the use of cellphones through voice-command technology - except for those driving with a learner's permit. Cellphone use is also allowed when a vehicle is lawfully parked or has its engine shut off.\nDriver's license points aren't applied to traffic violations involving cellphone use while operating a vehicle, but penalties of a $100 fine plus court costs for a fully licensed adult or $25 for a permit or provisional license holder can be enforced.\nWhich states have a 'No Touch Law?'\nWhile N.C. has laws around phone usage by a vehicle operator, it is not considered a no touch law state as there is no comprehensive ban around the handling of cellphones while driving. As of 2025, law firm Bennett Bricklin and Saltzburg listed the following states as those with no touch laws:\n- Alabama\n- Arizona\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Connecticut\n- Delaware\n- Georgia\n- Hawaii\n- Idaho\n- Illinois\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Maine\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- Michigan\n- Minnesota\n- Missouri\n- Nevada\n- New Hampshire\n- New Jersey\n- New York\n- Ohio\n- Oregon\n- Pennsylvania\n- Rhode Island\n- Tennessee\n- Vermont\n- Virginia\n- Washington\n- West Virginia\nIris Seaton is the trending news reporter for the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.
