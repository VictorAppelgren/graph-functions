  "title": "Sony, Gamestop hike prices on Playstation 5 in response to Japanese tariffs",
  "description": "Sony will raise prices of its PlayStation 5 consoles in the United States by around $50 from Thursday.",
  "content": "Sony will raise prices of its PlayStation 5 consoles in the United States by around $50 from Thursday, as the Japanese conglomerate navigates a slow recovery in the videogame market while U.S. tariffs threaten to raise costs.\n\nAll three PlayStation 5 consoles will see a similar price hike, with the most expensive PS5 Pro version expected to cost $749.99, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday.\n\nGamestop followed suit on Thursday, announcing in a post on X that it had made the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to hike retail prices across its PlayStation 5 inventories, but accessory prices would remain the same.\n\nThe price changes come after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from global manufacturing hubs such as China and Japan, leading to fears of supply chain disruptions and high material costs.\n\nSony had raised prices of its consoles in various European markets in April. Rival Xbox also hiked sticker prices of its consoles and accessories in the U.S., Europe, Australia and the UK a month later.\n\nConsoles were expected to be a major driver of videogame market growth this year due to the launch of premium titles such as Take-Two Interactive\u2019s \u201cGrand Theft Auto VI\u201d and Nintendo\u2019s Switch 2.\n\nBut console price hikes and the delay of highly-anticipated \u201cGTA VI\u201d to next year have cast some doubt on the pace of growth in the industry.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sony said there are no price changes for other markets and prices of PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged.",
