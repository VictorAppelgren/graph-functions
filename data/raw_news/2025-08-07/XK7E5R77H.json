The agreement represents a strategic distribution expansion for ALB and comes at a time when much of the category is contracting.\n\nALB Vodka\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8456/261670_40634146e490a8a4_001full.jpg\n\nWhile overall alcohol market trends have softened, ALB Vodka continues to grow. The brand's momentum is driven by a disciplined, consistent approach: no celebrity backing, no gimmicks, and no inflated claims-just a premium product with clear values, made in New York and priced for broad accessibility.\n\nOne key contributor to that growth has been ALB's national inflight partnership with JetBlue, which placed the vodka on all domestic and international flights. The program has significantly increased visibility and brand trial, showing how targeted partnerships with like-minded brands can scale consumer reach.\n\nAlongside this, the brand has quietly and steadily expanded retail and on-premise availability across the country, strengthening its channel presence without compromising on quality or pricing.\n\nSince launch, ALB Vodka has remained focused on a straightforward brand proposition: a high-quality, reasonably priced vodka made in New York, without celebrity endorsements or inflated marketing claims. The brand does not rely on buzzwords-instead, it has committed to consistent execution, value, and authenticity. That philosophy also extends to its home base of Albany, where ALB continues to support small businesses, sponsor local events, and contribute to community-focused initiatives that reinforce its roots.\n\nALB\u00ae (/\u0101'el'b\u0113/) Vodka is a premium gluten-free vodka made from 100% American corn and produced in Albany, New York. Known for its raw, authentic story as well as its dedication to both quality and value, ALB\u00ae Vodka embodies the spirit and energy of New York. With its expanding presence in prestigious venues and markets both domestically and internationally, ALB\u00ae Vodka is one of the fastest growing independently owned spirit brands in the country.
