  "content": "ANDERSON \u2014 A police report from the investigation of an Aug. 5 accident in Anderson that killed two men draws no conclusions on who was driving the stolen pickup truck.\n\nThe report, written by Detective Nolan Schaefer with the Anderson Police Department, states the 2006 Ford F250 truck was stolen from Jonesboro on the night of the crash.\n\nThe report states that Preston Jett, 20, and Landon Shaffer, 17, died as a result of the accident, which happened following a police chase from Alexandria. The third person in the truck was identified as Dalton Jett, 16.\n\nBoth Preston and Dalton Jett were thrown from the vehicle in the accident near the intersection of West 17th Street and Jackson Street.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it is unclear which of the vehicle's three occupants were driving the vehicle at the time of the crash,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe chase began after Alexandria police attempted to stop the pickup \u2014 on suspicion of drunken driving, criminal recklessness and reckless driving \u2014 about 2 a.m. near Washington Street and North Park Avenue in Alexandria.\n\nAnderson police reported the pickup was southbound \u2014 the wrong direction on one-way northbound Jackson Street between Sixth and 17th streets \u2014 \u201cat a high rate of speed\u201d before it crashed into two buildings in the 1700 block.\n\nThe driver of the pickup lost control, police reported, and \u201cthe vehicle left the roadway, struck a utility pole and two houses, then came to rest inverted on the roadway.\u201d\n\nThe chase ended about 12 miles from where it began in Alexandria.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going the wrong way on Jackson,\u201d an officer said over the radio.\n\nThe officer apparently ceased his active pursuit about 2:15 a.m., but kept an eye on the speeding truck to see where it was going.\n\nThe vehicle struck a curb moments later near the intersection of Jackson and 17th streets and became airborne, striking the two buildings on the east side of the road.\n\nOfficers from the Anderson Police Department were called to the scene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need several medics,\u201d an officer said over the radio moments later.",
