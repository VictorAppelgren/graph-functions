  "description": "A tablet is only as good as its battery, so it's time to start taking better care of it.",
  "content": "\u2022 Unplug at 100%, keep battery between 20% and 80%.\n\u2022 Use certified chargers to prevent stress and overheating.\n\nAs someone who uses a tablet daily, I'm constantly looking for ways to make its battery last longer. However, some habits you don't think twice about could actually be hurting your battery over time. There are ways to extend your tablet's battery life, and there are some things you should avoid that do the opposite.\n\nAlso: These 7 common household items were draining power all day - until I pulled the plug\n\nMost tablets offer six to eight hours of use on a single charge, though battery life diminishes with age and continued use. While there are many things you can do to conserve battery life, here are the ones you should avoid to ensure your battery's longevity.\n\nThis isn't always a problem with newer tablets, but most tablets on the market will suffer from being left plugged in overnight. Tablets typically charge to 100% and stop using electricity. However, leaving your tablet plugged in can cause it to continue trickle-charging to keep the battery full, which can stress the battery over time and diminish its lifespan.\n\nInstead, unplug your tablet when its battery reaches 100%. As a rule of thumb, it's best to keep your battery charged between 20% and 80%.\n\nAlso: Why I recommend this Samsung tablet over pricier models - especially the Ultra\n\nLike all the common charging mistakes we make with our tablets, leaving it plugged in overnight once or twice won't permanently damage it. Battery damage happens when these incorrect practices become a habit and are followed often.\n\n2. Letting the battery drain to 0% (and forgetting it)\n\nI've been guilty of letting my tablet's battery drain to 0% only to set it aside and forget to charge it for a couple of days. Repeatedly letting your battery drain to 0% makes it age much faster, risking battery death, requiring a replacement or repair to revive it.\n\nI've unfortunately learned this the hard way after leaving my discharged Nintendo Switch Lite in a drawer for a couple of months, only to learn that its battery had been irreparably damaged.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are simply not meant to stay empty, so most tablets don't truly hit 0% when they shut down. Instead, they shut down with a little charge to protect the battery, which is why a low-battery screen appears when you try to turn them on. If you leave your tablet with a drained battery for days, weeks, or months, the battery keeps slowly discharging until the voltage drops too low, damaging the battery's internal chemistry.\n\nAlso: 8 reasons why I replaced my Kindle with an iPad Mini for reading ebooks\n\nRepeatedly doing this results in a battery that is less capable of holding a charge or, worse, incapable of recharging altogether.\n\nTo prevent this and prolong your battery's life, avoid letting the battery drop below 20%. If you won't use your tablet for some time, charge it to 50% capacity and shut it down before storing it.\n\nYour local dollar store may be a good spot to get party and craft supplies, but not electronics. No matter how enticing the idea of buying a $1 charger seems, it's probably best to avoid it. Using a cheap, non-certified, or incorrect charger for your tablet can deliver inconsistent power, overcharge it, or result in inefficient charging. All of these result in increased strain on your battery and a shorter lifespan.\n\nUsing the wrong charger on your battery can do more than simply prolong its charging time. If a charger's wattage isn't properly matched to the battery, it can overheat your device as it struggles to supply enough power, or even overload the tablet's circuits if it can't regulate the power draw. Cheap chargers can also deliver fluctuating voltage, which stresses the battery and wears out its chemistry.\n\nAlso: This wall-mounted smart calendar has been a game changer in my home (and it's $50 off)\n\nMany certified chargers, like Apple-certified or USB-PD ones, have built-in safety measures that off-brand and cheap chargers skip. These measures prevent surges and overheating that could damage the battery and charging port.\n\nWhen charging your tablet, it's best to look for a charger that is either certified or properly matched for your device, from the cable to the brick.\n\nTrickle charging happens when your smartphone or tablet charges fully but remains plugged in, getting small amounts of electricity to keep its battery at 100%. If you plug in your tablet each night and it reaches 100%, its battery will lose a little charge over the course of the night, which triggers the charger to kick in to top it back up. Keeping lithium-ion batteries charged at 100% for long periods can stress them and accelerate wear, especially if it becomes warm. Also: Why your USB-C device won't charge - and what you can do instead This is why many smartphone manufacturers have added a slow charging feature when a device is plugged in overnight. Instead of quickly charging your battery to 100% and then topping it off for the rest of the night, your smartphone or tablet may take a few hours to reach 100%, closer to the morning. This extends the device's battery lifespan. Show more Chemical aging is a term used for the normal wear and tear that happens in a lithium-ion battery as it goes through repeated charging and discharging cycles. Over time, the chemical reactions that happen inside lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and tablets become less efficient, resulting in reduced capacity and risks of slower performance -- this is called chemical aging. Also: The best Android tablets of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed There's no way to avoid chemical aging; it's simply the way lithium-ion batteries age, but you can slow it down. Chemical aging is sped up by doing what is outlined above, like plugging in your device overnight, letting the battery drop to 0% often, using cheap chargers, and exposing the device to heat.

I have a portable thermal label printer that I've found to be just so useful for keeping things organized -- it prints really clear labels that are resistant to water, oil, acid, and heat. It's also powered by a built-in rechargeable battery. It's a great printer that costs less than $30.\nAlso: This USB power meter I tested is shockingly accurate - especially for how cheap it is\nBut I've now lost count of the number of times I've put it on charge only to find that it's flat when I need it. So, why?\nWhy some gadgets don't charge with USB-C\nWell, while the printer might have a USB-C port on it, it doesn't have the hardware to support USB-C charging protocols. On a more technical level, the manufacturer decided to save a few cents by omitting some basic components (usually just two resistors costing virtually nothing) to support different power inputs. Since USB-C doesn't supply power without first negotiating what the device needs, no power is delivered.\nBy contrast, USB-A always delivers a default 5V without any negotiation.\nAlso: I never leave home without this viral USB-C key ring accessory\nThe upshot is that while the port looks like every other USB-C port, if you plug in a USB-C cable that's attached to a USB-C charger, the device won't charge.\nWhich is rather annoying.\nThere is a big giveaway for a device with this limitation, and it's that it will come supplied with a USB-A to USB-A cable.\nThere's another rub. I've come across some USB-C chargers that will work with devices like this. They shouldn't, and are only working because they aren't compliant with the standards, but they will work.\nSo, what can you do?\nOK, assuming that you don't have a non-compliant USB-C charger that manages to work even though it shouldn't, what should you do?\n- Find the USB-A to USB-C cable that came with the device. Or buy a replacement cable or adapter, as they're only a couple of bucks. Or get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.\n- Use a cable like the Rolling Square inCharge universal charging cable that can transform into a USB-A to USB-C cable. Yet another reason to have one of these in your tech bag!\nAlso: My favorite USB-C accessory of all time got a magnetic upgrade - it's spoiled me ever since\nSo, if you have a USB-C device that doesn't charge from a USB-C charger, don't throw it away or start to get out the prytool -- try a USB-A to USB-C cable!\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Microsoft Authenticator won't manage your passwords anymore - or most passkeys\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Microsoft is a prolific supporter of using passkeys over passwords.\n- Authenticator will no longer save your passwords.\n- But Authenticator can't be your comprehensive passkey manager.\n- The Edge browser will likely fill that role one day, but it's not there yet.\nFor most of this year, Microsoft has been warning users that they will no longer be able to use its Authenticator mobile application for user ID and password management. As reported by CNET on July 29, 2025, \"In June, the company stopped letting users add passwords to Authenticator\u2026. And starting Aug. 1, you'll no longer be able to use saved passwords.\"\nAlso: How passkeys work: The complete guide to your inevitable passwordless future\nTo me, the dire warnings of this pending doomsday-like deadline are reminiscent of the run-up to January 1, 2000 -- the so-called \"Y2K problem\" -- when it was anticipated that computers everywhere would experience a meltdown because their programmers never considered the possibility that their software would still be in use in the 21st century.\nThe great passkey migration\nBut most of this reporting overlooks the bigger shift that's underway across Microsoft's identity management portfolio and, in many cases, is missing key details about the future roles of Microsoft Authenticator and the Microsoft Edge browser when it comes to another colossal shift that's currently in progress: the world's transition from passwords to passkeys.\nA passkey is unequivocally a safer credential than a password when it comes to logging into websites and apps. Passkeys cannot be guessed, the same passkey cannot be reused across different websites and apps, and you cannot be tricked into divulging your passkeys to malicious actors through techniques such as phishing, smishing, squishing, and malvertising. Even if you're strengthening user IDs and passwords with additional factors of authentication, passkeys are a better and more secure alternative.\nAlso: I replaced my Microsoft account password with a passkey - and you should, too\nIn fact, of the major technology vendors that are encouraging end-users to switch to passkeys, no vendor is pushing users to transition as hard as Microsoft is. But, at the same time that Microsoft is aggressively campaigning for that transition, we are still waiting for Microsoft to offer the comprehensive credential management capabilities that are necessary to support that future.\nManaging passwords after Authenticator\nFor users who managed their user IDs and passwords with Authenticator and want to stay with Microsoft-based solutions to manage their user IDs and passwords, their only option is to export their passwords from Microsoft Authenticator to Microsoft's Edge web browser. Once users do this, Edge will not only take over the role of managing those user IDs and passwords, it will also handle the auto-provisioning of those credentials (a.k.a. autofill) at the time of login and the synchronization of those credentials to the user's other copies of Edge.\nIn addition to Windows, Edge is available on MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. Given Edge's cross-platform reach when compared to that of Microsoft Authenticator (iOS and Android), it makes more sense for Edge to handle credential management and autofill.\nAlso: What if your passkey device is stolen? How to manage risk in our passwordless future\nThis approach, where Microsoft is facilitating credential management through the browser instead of a mobile application closely resembles the way Google is handling credential management and autofill through its Chrome browser. Both browsers are based on Chromium and offer users some basic password management capabilities, and both rely on a central cloud to handle credential synchronization to the same browser on other devices.\nThe problem with non-syncable passkeys\nBut, at the time this article was published, whereas Chrome's password management capabilities will auto-provision and synchronize credentials of both types (passwords and passkeys) to a user's other installations of Chrome, Edge can only synchronize passwords. According to a Microsoft spokesperson who was interviewed for this story, \"passkeys created for services like PayPal and eBay are stored as device-bound credentials in Windows and can be accessed via Windows Settings > Accounts > Passkeys. These are not stored or synced in Edge.\"\nIn other words, Edge for Windows is capable of handling and auto-provisioning passkeys during a login, but not the other versions of Edge. I confirmed this by trying to use Edge for Android to register a passkey for eBay. A lot happens behind the scenes when you register a passkey for the first time, and I explain the process in How Passkeys Work: Let's Start the Registration Process.\nAlso: 10 passkey survival tips: Prepare for your passwordless future now\nWhereas an eBay passkey registration option exists when using Edge for Windows, no such option was available to me on Edge for Android. In addition to that limitation, the eBay passkey that I was able to establish on Edge for Windows could not be synchronized to my copy of Edge for Android. This confirmed the spokesperson's statement about passkeys being \"stored as device-bound credentials in Windows.\" Device-bound passkeys are also referred to as \"non-syncable passkeys.\" As I wrote in my detailed comparison of syncable passkeys to device-bound passkeys (something that ever user should know going forward), device-bound passkeys are tied to the device that was used to create them and cannot be synchronized to another device. As it turns out, the passkey that I established through Edge running on my copy of Windows 11 was bound via Windows Hello to the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in my HP Notebook.\nThis raises the question of where, across Microsoft's portfolio, users might be able to find support for syncable passkeys since they are by far the most convenient form of passkey to use for the websites and apps that support them. After all, the company is already supporting syncable user IDs and passwords through Edge. The last thing most users want to do is manage multiple device-bound passkeys for each website and app they use. Better to just have one, just like a password.\nYour passkey management options now\nThis is where the confusion sets in. Across most of the articles that reported on the elimination of user ID and password support in Microsoft Authenticator, the authors also noted that Authenticator would continue to support passkeys and that the user could continue to rely on Authenticator to authenticate (login) with those passkeys (see my explanation of what really happens during your 'passwordless' passkey login). It's not surprising that most of the articles said this. After all, Microsoft's own post about the changes to Authenticator very clearly states, \"Authenticator will continue to support passkeys. If you have set up Passkeys for your Microsoft Account, ensure that Authenticator remains enabled as your Passkey Provider. Disabling Authenticator will disable your passkeys.\"\nThis certainly piqued my interest. On the surface, it was strangely starting to look like Microsoft was moving all user ID and password management to Edge while at the same time fracturing passkey management across Microsoft Authenticator and Edge for Windows instead of moving full support for both syncable passwords and syncable passkeys to Edge (which is exactly how Chrome does it). So I went back to Microsoft to make sure that I understood things correctly. I apparently didn't.\nAlso: Passkeys won't be ready for primetime until Google and other companies fix this\n\"Authenticator will always continue to support device-bound passkeys for Entra accounts,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told me. \"You'll always be able to create one of those today and in the future.\" There's a lot to unpack there. Not only are Authenticator-managed passkeys also device-bound passkeys (in other words, they cannot be synchronized), the passkey support found in Authenticator is for users of Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft's cloud-based identity management solution (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) for businesses. In other words, the passkey support found in Microsoft Authenticator is not for those of us in the general user population who just want to manage their credentials. And it still lacks any synchronization capabilities.\nIn a nutshell, for those of us in the general user population who want to manage and use passkeys in addition to user IDs and passwords, Microsoft offers one option: Edge on Windows. Additionally, neither Edge for Windows nor Microsoft Authenticator (for Entra ID users) offers passkey synchronization. The only type of passkeys that Microsoft currently supports are device-bound (non-syncable) passkeys. This is obviously not ideal, and knowing some of the folks at Microsoft, I'm sure they would agree (especially given how hard the company is selling the idea of passkeys right now).\nMy conclusion as I try to take a 30,000-foot view of this situation is that when it comes to all of the different Microsoft technologies that play a role in credential management -- Windows, Windows Hello, Authenticator, Edge, Microsoft Wallet, Entra ID, passkeys, etc. -- the company has a lot of different pieces on the chessboard. Moving them all into the ideal position to support the secure credential management future it is selling is easier said than done.\nAlso: What really happens during your 'passwordless' passkey login?\nIn the same way that a chess player (and opponent) always think and anticipate a few moves ahead, it's hard not to see that at some point, sooner or later (probably sooner), Microsoft will support syncable passkeys across all its versions of Edge just like it does now with user IDs and passwords (and just like Chrome does). That is the only logical outcome given its strongly worded messages to migrate passwords from Authenticator to Edge.\nBut until that final chess move happens, users have options in the other credential management companies, including Google and all the third-party password managers (1Password, BitWarden, Dashlane, LastPass, NordPass, etc.) that support syncable passkeys and passwords in a single solution.\nStay ahead of security news with Tech Today, delivered to your inbox every morning."

Though I enjoy the feel and texture of a good, old-fashioned printed book, I typically turn to ebooks because they're easier on the eyes. And what do I use as a reader? No, not a Kindle, but my trusty iPad mini.\nAlso: I finally found a tablet that can easily replace my iPad and Kindle (and is affordably priced)\nI've tried a couple of Kindles in the past, but didn't quite take to them. For me, the iPad mini is a more versatile device that offers certain advantages over a Kindle. First, though, I'm going to discuss the ways in which the Kindle beats an iPad mini. Yep, I'm playing devil's advocate to start.\n4 ways Kindle beats iPad mini for reading\nTo start, there's the price. Kindles come in different sizes, formats, and price tags. But even the most expensive Kindle, the 64GB Kindle Scribe, retails for $449. Other models are considerably less, starting with the Kindle Basic at $110. Compare that with the latest iPad mini 7th generation, which starts at $489.\nThen there's the display. Kindles use e-ink technology to deliver a crisp, sharp look that suits longer reading sessions. In contrast, the iPad mini sports a traditional LCD screen, which looks great but could strain the eyes after a while.\nAlso: Should you buy a refurbished iPad? I tried one from Back Market and here's my verdict\nAnother item in the Kindle's favor is size and weight. The basic Kindle with a 6-inch screen measures 6.2\"\u00d74.3\"\u00d70.32\", while the Kindle Paperwhite and Colorsoft with 7-inch screens both measure 7\"\u00d75\"\u00d70.3\". Due to their diminutive size, you can hold these Kindles in one hand and turn the page with the other, and they're relatively light.\nIn contrast, an iPad mini measures 7.69\"\u00d75.3\"\u00d70.25\". That's a bit more difficult to hold in one hand, especially if you have short fingers. The iPad is also heavier than a Kindle. However, I solved both the size and weight issues by attaching a cellphone grip to the back of my iPad mini. I can easily hold it with the third and fourth fingers of either hand and turn the page with the thumb of the same hand.\nFinally, battery life is another point for the Kindle. On a single charge, a Kindle can last for days, even weeks. The iPad mini lasts around 10 hours on a single charge.\nAlso: This simple Kindle accessory has seriously upgraded my reading experience - and it's cheap\nOK, those are definitely features that give the nod to the Kindle. Why do I still prefer an iPad mini for reading my favorite books? Read on.\n8 ways iPad mini beats Kindle\n1. Display size\nThe less expensive Kindles sport a 6-inch or 7-inch screen size, while the iPad mini boasts a screen size of 8.3 inches. I've always found the screen on the Kindle too small, especially since the bezels are large. For me, the iPad mini's screen delivers more bang for the buck, given its bigger real estate.\n2. Resolution\nThe Kindle offers a sharp display with e-ink technology, but the resolution is another story. The resolution on all Kindle models, including the latest Kindle Basic, is 300 ppi (pixels per inch). The full resolution on the 6-inch and 7-inch Kindles varies based on model and size but ranges from 1,072\u00d71,448 pixels for the Kindle Basic to 1,264\u00d71,680 pixels for the Kindle Colorsoft.\nAlso: This midrange Lenovo tablet has no business being this good (especially for traveling)\nThe iPad mini's resolution is 2,266\u00d71,488 at 326 ppi. For me, the iPad's higher resolution compensates for its LCD screen, resulting in sharp text and sharper images.\n3. Color vs. B&W\nMost Kindles use a black-and-white display. The Kindle Colorsoft is the exception. Though the text resolution on the Colorsoft is 300 ppi, the color resolution is 150 ppi. With the iPad mini's overall resolution of 326 ppi, such content as images, PDFs, and comic books look much better.\n4. Responsiveness\nThough Amazon has improved the responsiveness of the Kindle over the years, the iPad mini is still the winner here. Swiping or tapping from one page to another on a Kindle -- or pressing a button or control -- can be slow and even jerky at times. With its more powerful processor, the iPad mini is faster and smoother when moving from one page to another or accessing different controls.\nAlso: I tested the Kindle most people should buy. Here's why it's the best e-reader out of the lineup\n5. Controls\nI've never liked the way you control a Kindle. Tapping the screen moves you to the next page. To access key settings, you have to swipe down from the top of the screen. Viewing the page timeline and slider requires you to swipe up from the bottom. To view other settings or return to your library, you have to tap at the top in just the right spot. Yes, you can pinch the screen to zoom in and out, but that's about the only familiar aspect.\nAlso: Want free ebooks? These 10 sites offer thousands of options\nControlling an iPad mini is much more intuitive. Beyond pinching the screen to zoom in and out, simply tapping it displays all the available settings and controls.\n6. Greater capacity\nThe newest iPad mini starts with 128GB of storage and shoots up to as much as 512GB. The Kindle maxes out at 64GB. The comparison may not be fair, as the iPad mini is home to a variety of content, while the Kindle houses just ebooks. Still, you can squeeze a lot more books on the iPad than the Kindle.\nAlso: The 5 best iPads of 2025: We've tested every iPad on the market - these are the best ones\n7. Access to other ebook services\nThe iPad mini grants you access to a variety of book apps and services, including Amazon Kindle, Apple Books, Kobo Books, B&N Nook, and Google Play Books. You can also borrow ebooks from your local library via Libby, Hoopla, and other apps. On a Kindle device, you can\u2019t directly use any book service other than Amazon\u2019s Kindle. In some cases, you may be able to sideload certain apps, but the process is challenging.\n8. Versatility\nA Kindle has one job and one job only -- an ebook reader. The Kindle does come with a web browser, but its functionality is limited. As a tablet, the iPad mini brings you a world of apps, services, and content.\nAlso: The best iPads for college: Expert tested and reviewed\nBottom line\nThe Kindle is certainly an effective device for reading ebooks. But I still prefer the iPad mini for the reasons I mentioned here. For me, Apple's tablet is not only a more versatile device but works well as an ebook reader. With both an iPad mini and Kindle on my nightstand, I invariably reach for the iPad when I want to read a good book before bedtime.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Many people even use their devices as a replacement for their computer, as it's lighter than the traditional laptop and can easily connect to various accessories to enhance your experience.\nWith so many tablets on the market today from trusted brands like Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon, it can be daunting to choose the right one. The Amazon Fire Max 11 is a solid choice if you're on a budget. The iPad Pro and the Android flagship Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra however, are more of splurge. We'll help you make the most informed purchase, no matter what you're in the market for.\nWhat is the best tablet right now?\nOur pick for the best tablet for most people is the Apple iPad (11th generation) for $319, thanks to its versatility and lightweight form. This base-model tablet outperformed others in our benchmark tests for performance, and its low price is hard to beat.\nAlso: The best cheap tablets you can buy\nZDNET went hands-on with some of the best tablets on the market, using them for work, entertainment, and even testing them out with our kids. We also run our tablets through the gauntlet in our lab down in Kentucky, where we evaluated each tablet on this list on battery life, display brightness, and more.\nThe best tablets of 2025\nWhy we like it: Apple's tried-and-true tablet, the base model iPad, is arguably the best value in the company's tablet lineup thanks to its versatility and compatibility. Plus, Apple updated this tablet earlier this year to include double the base storage as last year's model, more random-access memory (RAM), and an upgraded processor in the A16 Bionic chip.\nWhen it comes to features, you essentially get the same suite as the more expensive iPad Pro and iPad Air models, but in a lighter form factor and an 11-inch Liquid Retina True Tone display.\nReview: iPad 2025 (11th-Gen)\nWho it's for: During hands-on testing, ZDNET writer Maria Diaz said that while many of the features are the same in this generation as the previous model, day-to-day performance is notably better. \"From the standard Geekbench 6 testing, the new iPad is a clear leader among previous base models,\" she wrote, adding, \"The higher scores mean you can expect less lag, faster multitasking, and a high-end gaming performance from the latest iPad compared to an older base model. This was evident in my testing, as the 11th-Gen iPad performed flawlessly during photo editing and gaming.\"\nThe base iPad model has always been a tablet for casual users, students, and kids, which makes it the best tablet for most buyers.\nWho should look elsewhere: The base-model iPad doesn't have Apple Intelligence capabilities or support for the newer Apple Pencil Pro, so if you're more of a power user and intend to use heavier apps like Final Cut Pro, for example, the iPad Pro or iPad Air would be better picks.\nApple iPad specs: Display: 11-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone | Processor: A16 Bionic chip | Storage: 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Silver, Pink, Blue, Yellow | Cameras: 12MP f/1.8 wide, 12MP Landscape f/2.4 front | Weight: 1.05 pounds | Dimensions: 9.79 x 7.07 x .28 inches | Connections: USB-C, Smart Connector | Battery life: Up to 10 hours of video playback with USB-C charging\nWhy we like it: The Fire Max 11 starts at $230 and boasts an 11-inch display, 4GB of memory, and 64GB of storage with support for 1TB of microSD card storage. If you're looking for a tablet for work and play, the Fire Max 11 Productivity Bundle costs $330 and comes with a keyboard with touchpad, case, and a stylus.\nReview: Amazon Fire Max 11\nWho it's for: ZDNET contributor Jason Cipriani went hands-on with the Amazon Fire Max 11 and said it's \"easily the best Fire Tablet Amazon has made yet.\"\n\"[T]he Fire Max 11 productivity bundle provides everything you need to get some work done on the small and affordable tablet, as long as your work can be done in Microsoft's suite of apps and services or in sites that work properly with Amazon's Silk Browser,\" he said.\nHowever, the Fire Max 11 is best suited for those looking for a basic entertainment tablet for streaming and browsing.\nWho should look elsewhere: This budget tablet doesn't come with high-end features, so if you want something more capable of handling premium apps or workloads, this isn't the tablet for you.\nAmazon Fire Max 11 specs: Display: 11-inch, 2000 x 1200, 410 nits brightness, 213 ppi | Processor: MediaTek MT8188J, 2.2Ghz Octacore processor | Storage: 64GB or 128GB | Memory: 4GB | Colors: Gray | Cameras: 8MP rear and 8MP front-facing camera | Weight: 1.08 pounds | Dimensions: 10.2 x 6.44 x 0.3 inches | Connections: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | Battery life: 14 hours\nWhy we like it: If you're looking for an Android tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is one of the best around. The Tab S10 Ultra features a 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, runs on the Android 14 operating system, and includes Samsung's S Pen stylus.\nThe base model comes with 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage, and a microSD card for up to 1TB of extra storage. Plus, this generation boasts new Galaxy AI capabilities thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ processor. The tablet can also handle artificial intelligence features like Sketch-to-Image, an improved version of Note Assist, and Circle to Search.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra\nWho it's for: ZDNET's Maria Diaz reviewed the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra and found it a superb option for creative professionals and productivity-focused users looking to take advantage of a strong processor and reliable AI features. Diaz added, \"Even those looking for an AI-powered tablet like an iPad Pro would do well to consider the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra.\"\nIf you opt for the $350 Book Cover Keyboard, you can effectively turn the tablet into an Android-powered 2-in-1 device with plenty of space for multitasking and using more than one app at a time.\nWho should look elsewhere: Just keep in mind the tablet isn't as portable as some other options on this list -- it weighs 2.35 pounds, compared to the S9 Ultra's 1.6 pounds. If you're looking for something more portable, the OnePlus Pad 2 or the Google Pixel tablet are lighter options.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra specs: Display: 14.6-inch, 120Hz refresh rate, Dynamic AMOLED 2X 2960 x 1848 display | Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ | Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | Memory: 12GB, 16GB | Colors: Moonstone gray and platinum silver | Cameras: Rear: 13MP main, 8MP ultrawide, Front: 12MP main, 12MP ultrawide | Weight: 2.35 pounds | Dimensions: 12.85 x 8.21 x 0.21 inches | Connections: 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi 6E, Wi-Fi Direct Bluetooth v5.3 | Battery: Up to 16 hours\nWhy we like it: The new OnePlus Pad 3 is a ZDNET Editor's Choice pick, and for good reason. The new model provides a smooth user experience thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which can handle more demanding AI tasks. This experience is further improved by its large 13.2-inch display, which ramps up to 144Hz.\nOverall, this $699 tablet competes well with tablets on this list that cost hundreds more. Plus, you don't have to pay extra for accessories: when you buy the OnePlus Pad 3, you get to choose two of three available accessories for free between the smart keyboard, the folio case, and the Stylo 2.\nReview: OnePlus Pad 3\nWho it's for: Those looking for a flagship tablet that won't break the bank will love the OnePlus Pad 3. ZDNET reviews editor Kerry Wan said that in his testing, the performance was reliably fast, adding, \"The tablet never showed frustrations with loading graphics, responding to inputs, and keeping services running in the background. I gracefully danced between on-screen gestures, keyboard shortcuts, and trackpad swipes, much like how I remembered doing with the $1,099 iPad Pro last year.\"\nWho should look elsewhere: There are no real drawbacks to this tablet, except perhaps its large size. If you want something smaller, you can opt for the OnePlus Pad 2, which has a 12.1-inch screen, or the Google Pixel Tablet, and its 11-inch screen.\nOnePlus Pad 3 specs: Display: 13.2-inch LCD display | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Storage: 256GB | Memory: 12GB | Colors: Storm Blue | Cameras: 13MP rear, 8MP front camera | Weight: 1.5 pounds | Dimensions: 11.40 x 8.25 x 0.24 inches | Connections: USB-C | Battery: 12,140mAh\nWhy we like it: Microsoft's 11th-generation Surface Pro earns the top spot as the best Windows tablet. The tech giant introduced several upgrades to this model, the most notable being Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite chipset. The hardware delivers solid performance, allowing the device to handle multiple apps and tasks without noticeable slowdowns.\nReview: Microsoft Surface Pro\nAdditionally, the Surface Pro features a PixelSense OLED touchscreen that delivers high-resolution images. Advanced color-enhancing software, such as adaptive contrast, further enhances the quality.\nWho it's for: ZDNET writer Cesar Cadenas said that this Surface Pro is for professional artists who want a high-performance machine with a brilliant display.\n\"The Surface Pro houses Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite, which, if the hype is to be believed, makes this laptop a 'MacBook killer,'\" he wrote in his review. \"Browsers ran smoothly, even with multiple videos playing and a lot of open tabs. First-party software and some third-party apps also did pretty well.\"\nThe additional accessories like the keyboard and pen make it even more enticing of a tablet that can double as a computer. Cadenas particularly called out the Surface Slim Pen and its accuracy and precision in both writing and illustration.\nWho should look elsewhere: This tablet is expensive, starting at a minimum of $1,000, and that doesn't include the pen and keyboard, which make it perform its best. Those looking to spend less money would be better off with a different pick, such as the OnePlus Pad 2.\nMicrosoft Surface Go 3 tech specs: Display: 13-inch OLED PixelSense Display | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite | Storage: Up to 1TB | Memory: 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB | Biometrics: Windows Hello face sign-in | Colors: Platinum, dune, black, or sapphire | Cameras: Quad HD front-facing Surface Studio Camera, 1440p Quad HD rear camera with ultrawide field of view | Weight: 1.97 pounds | Dimensions: 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 inches | Connections: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB-C | Battery life: 14 hours\nWhy we like it: Apple's 2024 iPad Pro lineup is by far the most capable and impressive iPad lineup we've seen, and it makes replacing your laptop with a tablet an easy decision. The design is much slimmer than previous Pro models and includes Apple's powerful M4 processor. This chip consists of a new 10-core GPU, next-generation machine learning accelerators to handle a diverse range of tasks, and ProMotion technology, enabling variable screen refresh rates ranging from 10 to 120Hz.\nThe Pro also supports the new Apple Pencil Pro, which has a range of features -- a squeeze gesture for quick changes, a gyroscope for precise control of pen and brush tools, and custom haptic feedback. It also pairs with the newly revamped Magic Keyboard, which is thinner and lighter, has a larger trackpad, and a new row of function keys this year, making the keyboard case more essential than ever for the full iPad experience.\nWho it's for: ZDNET's Kerry Wan said he was especially impressed by the new Tandem OLED screen, saying it makes it a great tablet for visual experiences. \"I've been able to complete text-heavy and photo-editing work -- which often requires adequate viewing angles -- under a New York City sun that thinks it's already summer,\" Wan wrote in his review. \"Watching Netflix and Disney+ on the iPad is straight eye candy; colors pop, and the darker, moodier scenes have a level of shadow detail unseen on older Pro models.\"\nReview: Apple iPad Pro (seventh-generation)\nWho should look elsewhere: This particular iPad is for power users for the highest of high-end professionals. Unless you are an artist or a designer using the Apple Pencil Pro with it every day, or putting it to use in other creative-intensive fields, the standard iPad would be a better option for regular tablet users.\nApple iPad Pro tech specs: Display: 11- or 13-inch Ultra Retina XDR OLED display with ProMotion | Processor: Apple Silicon M4 | Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB | Biometrics: Face ID | Colors: Silver, space black | Cameras: 12MP wide (4K, ProRes), Landscape 12MP ultra-wide | Weight: 11-inch: .98 pounds, 13-inch: 1.28 pounds | Dimensions: 9.83 x 6.99 x .21 inches or 11.09 x 8.48 x 0.20 inches | Connections: USB-C connector with support for Thunderbolt / USB 4 | Battery life: Up to 10 hours of surfing the web\nWhy we like it: Google's first Android tablet in years nails exactly the caliber of what Android tablets should have been all along. Not all apps are optimized for the larger screen, but Google's gotten clever in how it handles those apps while also getting developers to update their products for the bigger display.\nWho it's for: If you're a smart home person -- especially someone who uses Google Assistant -- this is the tablet for you, since it comes with a Charging Speaker Dock that doubles as a smart display. \"You can use the tablet as you would one of Google's smart displays, like the [Google] Nest Hub. You can talk to and interact with the Tablet via Google Assistant to control your smart home devices, play music, and watch videos on YouTube or a supported streaming service,\" ZDNET's Jason Cipriani wrote in his review of the Google Pixel Tablet.\nIt's also a great tablet for those looking for a long-lasting battery life. When it's not in use and is on the dock, it's constantly charged and ready for use.\nReview: Google Pixel Tablet\nCustomers who have bought the tablet have voiced on Reddit that they mainly use it for media consumption and that it serves that purpose well.\nWho should look elsewhere: Unfortunately, right now there isn't any sort of official keyboard or stylus for the Pixel Tablet. If you want a tablet with accessories like this, the OnePlus Pad 2 or Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet would be better picks.\nGoogle Pixel Tablet tech specs: Display: 10.95-inch LCD, 2560x1600, 500 nits | Processor: Google Tensor G2| Storage: 128GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Fingerprint sensor | Colors: Hazel, rose, porcelain | Cameras: 8MP front, 8MP rear | Weight: 1.09 pounds | Dimensions: 10.2 x 6.7 x 0.3 inches | Connections: USB-C, pogo pins | Battery life: Up to 12 hours of video playback\nWhy we like it: Apple's latest update to the iPad Air is more of a catch-up announcement. The seventh-generation iPad Air keeps the same design we saw Apple bring to the Air last year. This includes two size choices and Apple Pencil Pro compatibility, but it now boasts an M3 processor and Apple Intelligence.\nThe Apple iPad Air still follows the iPad Pro as the second-most capable tablet in the iPad lineup. With the new M3 chip, the Air gets about 17% gains in CPU improvements on the benchmark tests we performed. These improvements are most noticeable in better app performance, multitasking, and rendering speeds.\nReview: Apple iPad Air (7th generation)\nWho it's for: ZDNET's Maria Diaz also tested the new Air and said it was \"leaps and bounds ahead of my M1 MacBook Pro. I can attest to the tablet's strong performance and capability to support a creator's workflow.\"\nIf you want the latest and greatest AI features from Apple, the built-in Apple Intelligence in the iPad Air is also a perk of the latest model. Its intrinsic features are woven into the user experience, with shortcuts and access points that blend into iPadOS.\nWho should look elsewhere: The caveat to the iPad Air is that you must be willing to compromise on the applications you use and likely set up your browser to pull up desktop versions of your most frequently visited websites, since there are still some application limitations.\nApple iPad Air tech specs: Display: 11-inch or 13-inch Liquid Retina IPS, 60Hz | Processor: Apple Silicon M3 | Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Space gray, starlight, purple, blue | Cameras: 12MP rear camera, 12MP webcam (landscape-oriented) | Weight: 11-inch: 1.02 pounds, 13-inch: 1.36 pounds | Dimensions: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.24 inches and 11.04 x 8.46 x .24 inches | Connections: USB-C port and magnetic connector for Apple Pencil Pro | Battery life: 10 hours\nWhy we like it: The recently updated Kindle Scribe is perhaps the perfect example of an e-reader-tablet hybrid to satisfy your reading and note-taking needs. Its updated AI features include a new display with flush white borders and a paper-like texture, and Active Canvas -- a new experience for taking notes in books.\nThe Active Canvas allows you to take notes and scribble your thoughts directly onto the pages of your book. The Kindle Scribe now comes with the Premium Pen, a step up from the Basic Pen, with tools like a dedicated eraser and a shortcut button.\nReview: Amazon Kindle Scribe (2024)\nWho it's for: ZDNET editor Kyle Kucharski put the Active Canvas to the test and said he appreciated the feature as an avid note-taker. \"The cool design element here is that the notes you draw with the pan exist on another 'layer' than the book text, allowing you to edit what you write without messing with the text in the book,\" Kucharski wrote in his review. \"I actually found that I preferred using the sticky notes function, which drops a tiny icon on the text that, when tapped, opens up a floating window with your notes that can then be closed.\"\nThe device's AI features can also summarize up to 15 pages in a notebook, neatly extracting key takeaways from the text. It can also transcribe handwritten notes into text, which might benefit those with questionably legible handwriting.\nWho should look elsewhere: This tablet is not for those who want to browse the web or utilize apps like Instagram or Pinterest, so if that is the experience you're looking to get out of a tablet, an iPad or even the Amazon Fire Max 11 would be better suited for your needs.\nAmazon Kinde Scribe tech specs: Display: 10.2-inch 300 PPI Paperwhite display | Storage: 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB | Weight: .96 pounds | Dimensions: 7.7 x 9.0 x .22 inches | Connections: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB-C | Battery life: Up to 12 weeks (at 30 minutes per day)\nWhy we like it: This model is easily the best tablet for kids. Not only does it have a kid-proof case built to withstand the whims of 3- to 7-year-olds, but the tablet's 2024 update gave this device more storage and case color options.\nThe tablet also gives users a free six-month Amazon Kids+ subscription, which grants them access to thousands of kid-friendly and ad-free books, as well as movies, games, and other age appropriate and educational content. Parents who purchased this tablet through Best Buy give it an average rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars, and 95% would recommend it to other parents.\nReview: Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet\nWho it's for: This tablet was made specifically for kids and is built with kids and parents in mind. \"The Fire HD 8 Kids tablet is a well-built, entry-level tablet that comes with a sturdy kid-proof cover and features useful parental controls,\" said ZDNET's Maria Diaz, who bought the tablet for her kids. \"Its 13-hour battery life means that you'll need to charge it less often than other competitors, and the combination of a durable case and screen ensures the integrity of the Fire tablet for years to come.\"\nThe tablet's durable case is also worth mentioning because it protects against drops and bumps, and it comes complete with an adjustable stand for hands-free use. Amazon offers a two-year worry-free guarantee in case the tablet succumbs to playtime.\nWho should look elsewhere: If your kids are older, they might think this tablet is too childish. Therefore, they would do better with an iPad or the Amazon Fire Max 11 instead.\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids tech specs: Display: 8-inch display | Processor: Hexa-core 2.0 Ghz | Storage: 32GB or 64GB (expandable by up to 1 TB) | Memory: 3GB or 4GB | Colors: Blue, grape, Disney Pixar Cars, or Disney princess | Cameras: 2 MP front-facing and 5 MP rear-facing cameras with 1080p HD video recording | Weight: 1.14 pounds | Dimensions: 8.7 x 7.1 x 1.1 inches| Connections: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | Battery life: 13 hours\n*Tablets were tested with maximum volume for audio and video, in addition to maximum brightness\nWhy choose a tablet over a phone or laptop?\nTablets sit in the middle of smartphones and laptops. They are a compromisable device that allows for a bigger screen than a smartphone for tasks like editing PDFs, streaming movies, or browsing websites, but smaller and more portable than a laptop for note-taking, sketching and drawing, or photo editing.\nPlus, now many tablets have accessories like styli and keyboards that allow you to use it as a sort of laptop replacement if you're doing relatively easy work on it.\nWhat is the best tablet?\nAfter performing hands-on testing of all of these tablets, the 11th-generation iPad is our pick for the best tablet. It has up to 10 hours of battery life, 256GB maximum storage, and a lightweight design that's perfect for working or streaming movies on the go. It's fairly affordable price tag also makes it a great choice for students who need a mobile work device.\nIf you want to quickly see how the 11th-generation iPad specifically compares to the other tablets that made our list, see the handy chart below comparing factors like price, storage, and display size.\nTablet | Price | Display size | Storage |\nApple iPad (11th-gen) | $319 | 11 inches | Up to 512GB |\nAmazon Fire Max 11 | $230 | 10.1 inches | Up to 512GB with microSD card |\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra | $1,200 | 14.6 inches | Up to 1TB with microSD card |\nOnePlus Pad 3 | $700 | 13.2 inches | 256GB |\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 11 | $900 | 13 inches | Up to 1TB |\nApple iPad Pro (7th-gen) | $908 | 11 or 13 inches | Up to 2TB |\nGoogle Pixel Tablet | $399 | 10.95 inches | Up to 256GB |\nApple Gen iPad Air (7th-gen) | $549 | 11 or 13 inches | Up to 1TB |\nAmazon Kindle Scribe | $400 | 10.2 inches | 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB |\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids | $140 | 8 inches | 32GB or 64GB |\n*MSRP at the time of writing\nWhich is the right tablet for you?\nThe biggest question you'll need to answer about any tablet purchase is what you plan on using it for: Do you just want something to read a comic book and binge on some Netflix shows while you walk on the treadmill? If so, then a Fire tablet or the base model iPad is going to be more than enough for you.\nHowever, if you want to use a tablet more like a laptop, then you'll want to consider the iPad Pro, or one of the Surface devices. Here is a decision matrix that can help you choose which tablet is right for you:\nChoose this tablet... | If you want or are... |\nApple iPad (11th-gen) | The best overall option when it comes to power, storage, and user-friendliness. The Apple iPad is the best tablet for anything. |\nAmazon Fire Max 11 | An affordable tablet with basic features great for streaming. If you're looking to spend less on a tablet, this is a great pick. |\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra | An Android tablet with AI features and capabilities. This is Samsung's best tablet--and largest--tablet, by far. |\nOnePlus Pad 3 | The best Android tablet for entertainment and daily tasks like checking your email and browsing the web. |\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 11 | A powerful Windows tablet for travel and mobile work. It has a long-lasting battery life and has AI capabilities. |\nApple iPad Pro (7th-gen) | A tablet to replace your laptop thanks to its powerful Apple M4 chip. All you need to add is an attachable keyboard, and you have a device as powerful as the MacBook Pro. |\nGoogle Pixel Tablet | Google's Pixel Tablet is one of the best Android tablets on the market. It's fast, reliable and comes with a Charging Speaker Dock that completely changes how you use it. |\nApple iPad Air (7th-gen) | A lightweight tablet for those who want something for work and play, without big sacrifices in performance or features. |\nAmazon Kindle Scribe | A part e-reader, part tablet with an outstanding battery life and an included pen. It's even compatible with Microsoft Word. |\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids | A kid-friendly tablet with built-in parental controls. It even has a kid-proof case and a two-year worry-free guarantee. |\nFactors to consider when choosing the best tablet\nThese were the factors that were most important to us when making our top picks:\n- Feature sets: Not all tablets are created equal. Some are better for kids, others are simply for artists, and then there's the mini laptop for working professionals and students. We considered a variety of use cases to match virtually every need.\n- Price points: Tablets are an expensive piece of tech, especially if you're planning on investing in compatible accessories or buying for your kids to inevitably drop at a moment's notice.\n- Integrations with other products: We considered options that can work with a smart case, attachable keyboard, Apple Pencil, or Stylus, as well as other work and entertainment add-ons.\n- Battery life: Whether you're using your tablet for work, play, or both, you'll want it to last the duration of your task.\nHow we test tablets\nThe ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when tested in the real world. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.\n- Display: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.\nWe also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.\nPerformance: For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.\n- Battery life: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.\n- Camera and audio: For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.\nFor a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive tablet testing methodology.\nWhat are the different tablet sizes?\nTablets range in size from small to large. Small tablets are usually five to seven inches. Mid-size tablets have a screen ranging from nine to 11 inches. Then, there are large tablets with screen sizes from 12-14 inches.\nKeep in mind that the larger the tablet, the heavier it will usually be.\nLatest news on tablets\nDespite tariff concerns, 2025 is shaping up to be a big year for tablets. Already, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra, Apple iPad, Apple iPad Air, and the OnePlus Pad 3 have debuted on the market as new models. In addition, Apple is set to debut its new iPad Pro with an M5 chip at some point, most likely during its September event.\nAlso on the Apple front, iPadOS 19 is expected to also be released this fall, and we're expecting a better multitasking mode for better productivity on iPads.\nFAQs on tablets\nWhat does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?\nWhen a tablet says it is \"Wi-Fi Only,\" it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren't planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model.\nCan tablets replace a laptop?\nThat depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they're easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size. But if you want to do things like create spreadsheets, type in a word processing program, or do intensive 3D animation or modeling, you're better off with a laptop.\nWhat is the best tablet for students in 2025?\nOur top pick for the best tablet for students is the 10th-generation iPad, thanks to its affordable price and versatility of use. However, we'd also recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ or the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 for students looking to buy a tablet.\nAlso: The best tablets for students going back to school\nIf you're looking for a tablet with a keyboard, your best bet is the iPad Pro. This option is great for work as well.\nWhat is the best Windows tablet?\nThe best Windows tablet we've tested is the Microsoft Surface Pro 11, thanks to its long-lasting battery, high-quality OLED display, and great-performing chipset.\nAlso: The best Windows tablets you can buy\nWindows tablets are better suited for work since they support Windows apps that your job probably relies on and have the hardware capable of supporting them. Windows tablets also house chipsets normally found on laptops, whereas Android tablets typically have smartphone-like chipsets.\nRecent updates\n- In our July 2025 update, we made minor copy and layout changes.\n- In our June update, we made the new 11th-generation base-model iPad our top pick based on our hands-on testing, added the seventh-gen iPad Air as a top pick over the older generation model, added the new OnePlus Pad 3, added more context on product features, added news on upcoming tablets, and added new alternative picks."

They boast powerful performance, vibrant displays, and a user-friendly interface. It's a great time of year to pick up a tablet that can handle entertainment, reading, note-taking, and creative work. We tested the best models of 2025, from premium options like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, to budget-friendly picks like the Fire Max 11.\nIf you want to stay in the Android ecosystem for a tablet (or you're just curious to see what's out there), you have plenty of options. Whether you need a portable device to replace your laptop for work tasks, something to act as a smart home hub, or just a device for watching videos, there's an Android tablet that will meet your needs.\nWhat is the best Android tablet right now?\nI chose ZDNET staff-tested tablets that offer a reliable experience and a variety of features at a reasonable price point. Not all Android tablets are created equal, so I employed research and my experience with the products to suggest the best Android tablets below. I found that the best Android tablet overall was the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultrafor its giant display, stellar battery life, and accompanying S Pen.\nAlso: The best Samsung tablets\nThe best Android tablets of 2025\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the biggest and best tablet in Samsung's lineup. It features a 14.6-inch AMOLED 2x screen, runs Android 15, and comes with Samsung's S Pen stylus included. The base model comes with 12GB of memory, 256GB of storage, and a microSD card for adding up to an extra 1TB of storage to the tablet. You can also fully kit out the Tab S10 Ultra with 1TB of storage and 16GB of memory.\nZDNET writer Maria Diaz went hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra and said that it is one of the best productivity tablets she has ever tested.\n\"The S10 Ultra is a futureproof tablet with a powerful chipset, Wi-Fi 7 support, and long-term OS updates, [making it] perfect for power users,\" she wrote. But the tablet won't come cheap; the S10 Ultra starts at $1,200.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra\nYou'll also want to pick up the $349 book cover keyboard. Once connected, you can use Samsung DeX on the S10 Ultra, turning the tablet into a full-on desktop computer where you can get almost anything done.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra specs: Display size:14.6-inch | Display type: Dynamic AMOLED 2X | Resolution: 2960 x 1848 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | RAM: 12GB, 16GB | Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, microSD up to 1TB\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Plus was intended to be a second-level tablet in the Galaxy S10 line of tablets. The specs are similar to that of the S10 Ultra, but the Tab S10 Plus costs $200 less. This tablet features a screen 2.2 inches smaller than the S10 Ultra, but both models have the same Dynamic AMOLED display and refresh rate.\nIncluded with the purchase of this tablet is Samsung's S Pen, which provides a realistic paper-on-pen experience. In addition, you can add the $229 keyboard accessory to the tablet, turning it into a DeX-powered 2-in-1 that you can use to hammer out emails, crush work reports, write your next novel, or watch your favorite YouTube channel.\nI went hands-on with the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and found that movies and shows were a joy to watch with bright colors, flawless performance, and outstanding audio playback. Even my wife was shocked that the output came from the tablet, not an actual speaker.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Series\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus tech specs: Display size:12.4-inch | Display type: Dynamic AMOLED 2X | Resolution: 2,800 x 1,752 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | RAM: 12GB | Storage: 256GB, 512GB, microSD up to 1TB\nSamsung didn't release an entry-model Galaxy S10 this year, but last year's Galaxy S9 tablet is still one of the best. It comes with 8GB or 12GB of memory and starts at 128GB of storage, which can be expanded by up to 1TB thanks to microSD card support. Inside the Tab S9 is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor.\nThe 11-inch LCD screen is compact enough to make the tablet portable. The tablet's high resolution also ensures display clarity, so you'll be happy watching your favorite shows or gaming on it. The S9 also comes with an S Pen that you can use to write or draw in your favorite apps, just like the Samsung Galaxy Note lineup.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Tab S9\nI tested this base Tab S9 model, and overall, it was an enjoyable experience. If you primarily use a tablet without a keyboard, with one app on the display most of the time, then the Tab S9 is your best option. Reddit users agree that this tablet is best for media consumption.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 tech specs: Display: Display size: 11-inch | Display type: Dynamic AMOLED 2X | Resolution: 2560 x 1600 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | RAM: 8GB, 12GB | Storage: 128GB, 256GB (expandable with microSD)\nThe new OnePlus Pad 3 is a ZDNET Editor's Choice pick, and for good reason. The new model--which debuted in June 2025--provides a smooth user experience thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which can handle more demanding AI tasks. This experience is further improved by its large 13.2-inch display, which ramps up to 144Hz.\nOverall, this $699 tablet competes well with Android tablets on this list that cost hundreds more. Plus, you don't have to pay extra for accessories: when you buy the OnePlus Pad 3, you get to choose two of three available accessories for free between the smart keyboard, the folio case, and the Stylo 2.\nReview: OnePlus Pad 3\nZDNET managing editor Kerry Wan said that in his testing, the performance was reliably fast. He added, \"The tablet never showed frustrations with loading graphics, responding to inputs, and keeping services running in the background. I gracefully danced between on-screen gestures, keyboard shortcuts, and trackpad swipes, much like how I remembered doing with the $1,099 iPad Pro last year.\"\nOverall, there are no real drawbacks to this tablet, except perhaps its large size. If you want something smaller, you can opt for the OnePlus Pad 2, which has a 12.1-inch screen, or the Google Pixel Tablet, and its 11-inch screen.\nOnePlus Pad 3 specs: Display: 13.2-inch LCD display | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Storage: 256GB | Memory: 12GB | Colors: Storm Blue | Cameras: 13MP rear, 8MP front camera | Weight: 1.5 pounds | Dimensions: 11.40 x 8.25 x 0.24 inches | Connections: USB-C | Battery: 12,140mAh\nGone are the boxy and square tablets of Amazon's past; the company completely redesigned the Fire HD 8 lineup with a more rounded look and feel. Amazon released two new tablets; the Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 8 Plus. I am including only the HD 8 Plus in this list because it's worth the extra $20 for added memory and support for wireless charging.\nThe Fire HD 8 runs Amazon's Fire OS. It runs Android apps, but you're limited to apps available in Amazon's App Store. Like with most tablets in this price range, performance can be sluggish sometimes, but you'll have no issues shopping, browsing Facebook, or checking your email on the Fire HD 8 Plus.\nReview: Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus\nZDNET Reviews Editor Kerry Wan called buying the Amazon Fire HD Plus a \"no-brainer\" if you're in the market for a cheap Android tablet. \"If you're eyeing a tablet that can play your child's favorite YouTube videos or control your home's Alexa-supported devices or even serve as a digital cookbook, then Amazon's Fire HD 8 Plus is a no-brainer at a fraction of the cost of the\nAmazon customers praise this affordable tablet for its image quality, mentioning that the display is crisp and that the charger is snappy and quick.\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Plus tech specs: Display size:8-inch | Display type: IPS LCD | Resolution: 1,280 x 800 | Refresh rate: 60Hz | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32GB or 64GB\nGoogle hadn't had an Android tablet since the death of the Google Pixel Slate in 2018, but the company announced a new iteration in May 2023. Built specifically for entertainment and casual at-home use, the Pixel Tablet has a 10.95-inch LCD display with a 2,560 x 1,600 pixel resolution. It's powered by the Google Tensor G2 chip that's found in the Pixel 7 line and the Pixel Fold.\nReview: Google Pixel Tablet: What Android tablets should have been all along\nWhat's interesting about this tablet is that the included charging dock also converts it to a Nest Hub, meaning that when you're not using the tablet to watch YouTube, it has a second purpose as a smart home display. The battery life can last up to 12 hours of video streaming and supports third-party stylus pens.\nWe note in our review of the Google Pixel Tablet that it won't replace a laptop for school or work but could be handy if your home is a Google smart home. If you're looking for a tablet that can double as a smart display (if you don't already have a smart display in your smart home), this could be a good option for you. Customers who have bought the tablet have voiced on Reddit that they mainly use it for media consumption.\nPixel tablet tech specs: Display size:10.95-inch | Display type: LCD | Resolution: 2,560 x 1,600 | Refresh rate: 60Hz | RAM: 8GB | Storage: 128GB or 256GB\nSamsung recently launched two new FE tablets with the same internal components and two display/battery capacity options. The smaller Tab S9 FE is available for $450 and offers a lot in a sleek package. The high-powered tablet comes with an S Pen and even an IP68 dust/water resistant rating, making it a good choice for first-time tablet owners.\nIt has an 8,000mAh battery, 6 or 8 GB of RAM, 128 or 256 GB of included storage, and support for a microSD card up to 1TB. Color options include gray, silver, mint, and lavender.\nIt remains a media powerhouse with AKG-tuned dual speakers. Video calling is well supported with a front 12MP ultra-wide camera and a rear 8MP camera to help capture documents.\nOverall, 98% of Best Buy customers would recommend this tablet, giving it an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE tech specs: Display size: 10.9-inch | Display type: TFT LCD | Resolution: 1200 x 800 | Refresh rate: 90Hz | RAM: 6 or 8 GB | Storage: 128GB or 256GB\nIf you're looking for an Android tablet for kids, Amazon's Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet is perfect for children ages six through 12. This new generation boasts 25% faster speeds, higher quality 5-megapixel cameras, and 13 hours of battery life instead of 12 hours.\nThanks to the 10.1-inch display, you'll get a larger screen without adding much to the overall cost. The resolution is better than that of previous generations, with a 1080p Full HD brighter display.\nReview: Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro\nZDNET writer, Maria Diaz, gave her kids this tablet and was pleasantly surprised by its performance. \"One thing I appreciate about Amazon's Kids Tablets is the strong parental controls,\" she wrote in her review. \"I can easily control what my kids watch, approve their app and purchase requests, and set up time limits from the app on my phone.\"\nParents on Reddit agreed and added that the screen icons are huge and easy for kids to identify.\nAmazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet tech specs: Display size: 10.1-inch| Resolution: 1,920 x 1,200 | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32GB (expandable up to 1TB)\nWhat is the best Android tablet?\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the best Android tablet on the market, in my opinion, and according to expert reviews. However, if you're looking for a less expensive Android tablet for your kids or a more compact size for life on the go, you may want to consider another option.\nBelow, I've broken down the best Android tablets based on price, display size, and storage capacity.\n| Android tablet | Price | Display size | Storage |\n| Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra | $1,050 | 14.6 inches | Up to 1TB |\n| Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ | $970 | 12.4 inches | Up to 1TB |\n| Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 | $600 | 11 inches | Up to 256GB |\n| OnePlus Pad 3 | $699 | 13.2 inches | 256GB |\n| Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus | $80 | 8 inches | Up to 64GB |\n| Google Pixel Tablet | $500 | 10.95 inches | 128GB or 256GB |\n| Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE | $326 | 10.9 inches | 128GB or 256GB |\n| Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro | $190 | 10.1 inches | 32GB |\nWhich Android tablet is right for you?\nThe first question you should ask yourself is how you want to use the tablet. If the answer is lightweight web browsing, email checking, watching videos, and the occasional game, then a low-end tablet like the Fire HD 10 or Google's Pixel Tablet is more than capable for you.\nHowever, if you want a premium Android tablet to use as a laptop replacement with a dedicated keyboard and high-quality display, then Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 lineup is where you'll want to focus.\nAs long as you know what you want out of an Android tablet, it's easy to figure out which Android tablet is right for you.\nChoose this Android tablet\u2026 | If you want\u2026 |\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra | The best Android tablet on the market. |\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10+ | Screen quality that matches the flagship model.

We considered a variety of use-cases to match virtually every need.\n- Price points: Tablets are an expensive piece of tech, especially if you're planning on investing in compatible accessories. We included Android tablets at different price points so there is something for every budget.\n- Integrations with other products: We considered options that can work with an attachable keyboard, a stylus, and other work and entertainment add-ons.\n- Battery life: Whether you're using your tablet for work or play (or both), you'll want it to last the duration of your task.

The Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus and HD 10 Plus use the Android operating system. It comes with the Amazon App store pre-installed, but no Google Play Store.

This is made worse by summer temperatures being at record highs, with heat waves wreaking havoc across various states in the past few weeks. As someone who's gone through a few of these this summer alone, I'm constantly looking for ways to conserve energy.\nThere are many little things you can do that can shave dollars off your monthly energy bill, and they go beyond switching off the lights when you leave the room. Did you know you can save 3% on cooling costs for every 1\u00b0F increase in your thermostat? As a fan of data, I've looked into multiple quantifiable ways to save energy and how these translate into saving money.\nAlso: Apple's tariff costs and iPhone sales are soaring - how long until device prices are too?\nUnplugging a single device when not in use isn't going to save you a bucket of cash. But unplugging multiple devices adds up quickly to help you save, especially when you make a habit of it. Here are the devices you should unplug when they're not in use, and how doing so could save you almost $200 a year, depending on your local rates.\n1. TVs, gaming consoles, and office devices\nIt's easy to forget to unplug TVs that aren't in daily use, but it happens more often than you'd think. This is especially true if you have a TV in a guest room or common area that isn't often occupied. Simply unplugging your TVs when not in use could save you between $2 and $6 a year for each one. As soon as I learned this, I ran to unplug my guest room and office TV.\nSimilarly, a printer left plugged in can cost between $3 and $8 a year when idle. One can consume between 2W and 6W when not in use, adding another good savings option.\nAlso: These jobs face the highest risk of AI takeover, according to Microsoft\nA single gaming console like a PlayStation or Xbox can consume between 1.5W and 10W in standby power, which can cost up to a dollar each month for a device that is not in use. It's a good idea to unplug these devices when you'll be out of the house or overnight, just keep in mind that you may still want to leave them in rest mode so you don't miss an update.\nYou should also consider unplugging sound bars and speakers when not in use, especially in areas that don't get daily use.\n2. Coffee makers and kitchen devices\nUnfortunately, I learned the hard way that my Keurig coffeemaker was driving up my power bill. I kept my Keurig in standby mode, rather than asleep, so it was always ready to brew a cup of coffee. This can consume from 60W and 70W because it has to keep the water warm and ready. This can translate into up to $60 a year.\nAlso: This unexpected robot vacuum made me forget about my $2,000 Roborock\nSimilarly, a mini-fridge can cost you up to $130 a year to run, which doesn't always pay off if you don't need it to run all the time. I used to forget to refill my mini-fridge, so it ended up running empty for weeks, wasting between 50-100W of energy and costing me money. If you have a mini-fridge that you only use seasonally, like in your sunroom during summer months, it's best to unplug it when not in use. Doing so can save you over $10 a month on energy bills.\n3. Smart home devices that are mostly idle\nMost smart home devices are focused on improving energy efficiency, but they can also be vampire devices. Smart devices are always consuming energy because they remain connected to either the internet or another device, like a hub. However, smart devices tend to consume very low phantom loads, so you don't need to rush to unplug them all.\nSmart bulbs and plugs, though small, are always drawing a small amount of power, around 1W. This only costs you between $0.65-$1.30 a year, depending on your local rate, but it can add up if you have multiple of these devices, especially if you don't use them often.\nI have a lot of smart bulbs at home and I kill the switch on the ones that I know we won't be using un the near future. Similarly, I unplug my smart plugs when they don't have a device plugged into them.\nAlso: I let this Segway robot mow my lawn for months - here's why it's been irreplaceable for me\nA smart plug can often save you money on your energy bill. For example, if you have an older Keurig without scheduling capabilities that you'd like to have ready when you wake up, you can put a smart plug on it and schedule it to turn on just an hour a day. I also use my smart plugs to run a grow light for houseplants, a fan, and an older lamp.\n4. Older devices around your home\nMany people still have older devices plugged in that they haven't used in a long time, but either forgot or simply don't think twice about it. A single set-top cable box, DVR, or Blu-ray player can cost you up to $20 a year to power when not in use, depending on your local rates.\nLook around your home and see what is plugged in that doesn't need to be, including alarm clocks, cordless phone bases, electric kettles, hair dryers, and more. Unplugging these devices and only plugging them back in before using them can pay off, even if it's just a few dollars a month.\nFAQs\nMore tips to save on utilities this summer\nEven as the temperatures reach scorching highs, there are many ways to save on your utility bills this summer.\nHere are some things you can do to save money on your energy bills:\n- Run a fan instead of turning down the A/C: Your central air conditioner unit uses between 2,000W and 2,500W when running, while a ceiling fan, for example, uses around 50W. You can set your thermostat between 4-6 degrees higher during the warmer months and use a fan to save energy costs and the life of your A/C unit.\n- Keep the heat out: A warmer house takes more effort to cool, so you should make sure your windows are completely shut and your home is properly insulated. Closing the blinds and adding blackout curtains in some rooms can also maintain a cooler temperature throughout the day.\n- Switch to LED bulbs: I'm sure you've heard this before, but this is a fantastic way to save on your utility bill. LED bulbs use 80-90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and generate less heat.\n- Learn about energy savings through your utility provider: Many providers offer opportunities to save on your energy bills, especially during peak usage days and hours. Find out if your utility provider has a savings program and what you can do to participate in it.\nWhat are vampire devices?\nYou've likely heard about unplugging common household appliances and devices when not in use to save energy. Devices that consume energy even while they're switched off are aptly called 'vampire devices,' and you may have more of them in your home than you think.\nAlso: This thermostat mistake was costing me hundreds: 3 tips to get the best temperature control\nThe US Department of Energy recommends unplugging devices when not in use to reduce phantom loads. Doing so can save you up to 10% on your energy bill, which is a pretty significant amount for such little effort.\nDoes unplugging devices actually save money?\nUnplugging devices can help you save more energy than you'd think, especially if you often forget to switch off appliances like your Keurig. Many of the devices in our homes consume power even if they're not in use, and the key to saving on your energy bills lies in compounding your potential to conserve energy.\nAs someone with a whole-home backup system that sees multiple power outages a year, I make a habit of unplugging devices to save energy. This is even more evident when the power goes out and I go through all my home's circuits using the EcoFlow Smart Home Panel. The EcoFlow app shows me the load that each circuit in my home carries at any given time, and lets me turn them off from my phone.\nAlso: I let this Segway robot mow my lawn for months - here's why it's been irreplaceable for me\nWhen the power goes out, I unplug devices that aren't essential and turn off non-critical circuits. If my home consumes 1.2kWh at any given time, I can easily halve this by unplugging devices and switching off circuits. I unplug anything from smart plugs and lamps to air purifiers and robot vacuums that don't need to be used during a power outage, and I keep my home running with only 330Wh to 600Wh to extend the life of my backup battery.\nGet the best tech tips in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

I enjoy working on the iPad Air daily, so I've looked forward to testing the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ since its launch. This tablet is a direct competitor to the M3 iPad Air that Apple just launched, which has become my tablet of choice for writing, reading, and entertainment.\nBut while the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ is comparable to the iPad Air in some ways, it exceeds Apple's tablet's capabilities in others.\nAlso: Why I pick this ultraportable Lenovo tablet over the iPad for mobile entertainment\nThe FE series of Samsung devices is an affordable alternative to its flagship devices. Just like there is a lineup of FE Galaxy smartphones, Samsung makes FE alternatives to its flagship tablets. I've tested the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and S10 Ultra, so I was eager to see how the S10 FE+ compares.\nI've also recently tested several comparably priced tablets, like the Honor Pad V9 and the latest iPad Mini, and the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ fared well.\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ has an Exynos 1580 chip, which Samsung says makes the tablet about 32% faster than its predecessor, the Tab S9 FE+. This isn't a high-end processor, but it's great for everyday tasks and is one of Samsung's compromises with its FE devices.\nThis tablet can handle everyday media and work tasks, and the included S Pen is handy for notetaking and creative work. The Tab S10 FE+ isn't built for power users but is perfect for light work, including video calls, photo editing, messaging, and using Samsung DeX.\nAlso: Not sold on screenless drawing tablets? This new Wacom won me over\nThe 13.1-inch display is a size upgrade from the previous Tab S9 FE+, which had a 12.4-inch screen. The larger screen offers more space for multitasking with split screen, media streaming, gaming, and creative work like sketching.\nThe battery life is reliably good, especially when you use this tablet for entertainment. The S10 FE+ has a large, 10,090 mAh battery, and its efficient performance ensures it lasts a full workday. For comparison, the longest battery life I've tested on a tablet thus far is the Honor Pad V9, which has a 10,100 mAh battery. The 2024 iPad Pro has an 8,160 mAh battery, and the 13-inch iPad Air M3 has a 9.705 mAh battery, for reference.\nAlso: Are these cheap Amazon tablets actually viable? My buying advice after a month of testing\nI like that Samsung's newer tablets are IP68-rated for water and dust resistance. This may not sound like a big deal, but as someone who's gotten used to carrying my tablet around everywhere with me, it is. I've often had to dry my tablet after an accidental water spill or unknowingly putting it on a wet surface.\nThe panic that courses through me as I frantically dry my tablet each time it touches moisture is only understood by anyone who has lost a device to water or had smartphones over ten years ago (RIP to my BlackBerry Bold, on both accounts).\nWhile you can't (and shouldn't) swim with the Tab S10 FE+, you can breathe a little easier when it gets wet and move on to dry it without experiencing throat-clenching anxiety. The IP68 rating isn't there to encourage you to bring your tablet when you go scuba diving, but to protect your investment.\n| Geekbench 6 scores | Single-Core CPU Benchmark | Multi-Core CPU Benchmark | GPU benchmark |\n| Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ | 1,353 | 3,923 | 6,982 |\n| iPad Air (M3) | 3,098 | 11,689 | 44,406 |\n| iPad Air (M2) | 2,622 | 10,007 | 41,771 |\nIn benchmark testing, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ proved far more basic than the comparably priced iPad Air from 2024 (M2) and 2025 (M3). If you're looking for a tablet to switch between heavy apps or demanding video editing, you'd do better with an iPad Air. But if you're looking for one with a longer battery life, an included stylus, and water resistance, then the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ is best.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ is a great midrange tablet for entertainment, so media enthusiasts can rejoice in its large 13.1-inch display and 90Hz refresh rate. But creators, students, and professionals alike can also benefit from it, especially those looking for an everyday tablet within the Galaxy ecosystem that doesn't reach premium prices.\nAlso: I replaced my Kindle and iPad within hours of testing this tablet\nThe Tab S10 FE+ is slim and very lightweight. It's also waterproof and comes with an S Pen, making it better suited for portability than other comparable options. You can take this tablet with you almost anywhere and use it for entertainment, notetaking, or work without second thoughts about the elements you'll expose it to.\nThis story was first published on April 22, 2025, and was updated on July 31, 2025, with more relevant internal links and the expiration of the Prime Day deal."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-need-a-firewall-on-linux-heres-why-and-which-to-use/",
      "text": "Yes, you need a firewall on Linux - here's why and which to use\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Linux is highly secure, but you should still have a firewall.\n- You should know if your ISP's hardware (gateway) uses a firewall.\n- One of the easiest Linux firewalls is UFW and its GUI sidekick, GUFW.\nI've been using Linux for nearly 30 years. Over those years, I've experienced only one security issue (a rootkit on a server I inherited). The reason for that is Linux's heightened security. Out of the box, it includes a tight permissions system and security mechanisms (such as AppArmor and SELinux) that do an amazing job of locking down the operating system.\nBut what about the firewall? You know about firewalls, especially if you've used Windows (because Microsoft's OS has always depended on them). And before you think it, no matter how secure your web browser is, it's not enough.\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 9 things you need to know\nAlmost every Linux distribution ships with a firewall that is ready to use. Oddly enough, however, some distributions ship with the firewall disabled.\nThat seems counterintuitive for an operating system that hangs its hat on security.\nThe big question you may ask is, \"Does Linux even need a firewall?\"\nBefore answering that question, I'll ask you some questions:\n- Is your Linux machine on a home network?\n- Does your home network have a router that includes a firewall?\n- Is your router regularly updated?\n- If your home network has a router with a firewall, are there any ports open?\n- Do you have sensitive data on your computer?\nYou might not know the answers to those questions, which means you might have to contact your ISP and ask them about the hardware in use. For example, AT&T Fiber does include a firewall on its gateway hardware. Comcast's Xfinity gateways also include a firewall.\nAlso: 8 things you can do with Linux that you can't do with MacOS or Windows\nIf you know your ISP hardware includes a firewall, the need for a firewall on your Linux machines is less pressing than otherwise.\nBut does that mean you should forget about the firewall?\nI say, no.\nI say, the more security, the better.\nFor example, your ISP's gateway goes without updates, which could leave it vulnerable to attacks. Some ne'er-do-well figures out what gateway you're using, breaks through its unpatched defenses, and has access to your network. If your Linux machine isn't protected via a firewall, that bad actor could access the machine through an open port and have at the data it contains.\nYou don't want that.\nErgo\u2026 firewall.\nBut which one should you use?\nDifferent distributions ship with different firewalls. For example, Ubuntu (and those based on Ubuntu) ship with Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), whereas Fedora (and those based on Fedora) ship with firewalld. Although both are solid options, I give the nod to UFW because it's so easy to use. And if you don't want to use the command line, there are GUI apps you can install to control UFW.\nAlso: You can try Linux without ditching Windows first - here's how\nEven from the command line, UFW is easy. To enable it, issue the command:\nsudo ufw enable\nOnce enabled, all ports are closed, and accessing your machine is made exponentially more challenging. Let's say, however, that you regularly use SSH to access that machine from your LAN. For that, you could issue the command:\nsudo ufw allow ssh\nOr maybe you want to only allow SSH from a single IP address within your LAN, which can be done with:\nsudo ufw allow from IP_ADDRESS to any port 22 proto tcp\nWhere IP_ADDRESS is the address of the machine you want to allow in.\nThose same actions with Firewalld look like this:\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=ssh\nOr\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-source=IP_ADDRESS --zone=drop\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=drop\nsudo firewall-cmd --list-all\nWhere IP_ADDRESS is the address of the machine you want to allow in.\nObviously, UFW is the easier tool, and I would always recommend it over firewalld for those who are just getting into Linux.\nAnd if you want a GUI for UFW, try GUFW (which can be installed from your GUI app store).\nIn the end, the answers to the questions are simple:\n- Do you need a firewall on Linux? - yes\n- Which one should you use? - UFW\nUnderstand that if you want to use UFW on Fedora-based systems, you must install it. To do that, issue the following commands:\nsudo systemctl stop firewalld\nsudo systemctl disable firewalld\nsudo dnf remove firewalld\nsudo dnf install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\nYou now have UFW running on your Fedora-based distribution.\nWith a firewall active, your Linux machine will be better protected, should someone get around the defenses of your ISP's hardware. As always, it's better to be safe than sorry.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

I did the math, and here's my buying advice\nI remember when people used to scoff at refurbished tech. Buying a used phone or computer was like rolling the dice: you never knew exactly what you were getting.\nWell, the times certainly have changed. And, in this economy, the prices on refurbished tech are looking more and more tempting. Consumers are challenging this idea that we're all supposed to buy brand new phones and laptops every few years, and in the process, the market for refurbished tech has blown up.\nAlso: Should you buy a refurbished iPad? I tried one from Back Market and here's my verdict\nHaving never purchased a refurbished product myself, I was very curious as to how the experience would go with a new (used) laptop. So, I connected with the folks at Back Market and acquired a $950 MacBook Pro M1 from 2021 to test out as my main driver for a few weeks.\nI'll say right now: it wasn't a perfectly seamless experience, but buying brand new tech rarely is, either. Here's how it went, and what I've learned from the process.\nHow Back Market works\nFirst thing you should know is that the retailer offers different tiers of products: you can buy a MacBook in Fair, Good, Excellent, or Premium condition, with the prices scaling higher with better condition. If you're wondering what Fair condition looks like, it could include some visible signs of use, but ultimately, the internal parts have been inspected and verified by Back Market to be in good working order.\nAfter choosing the level of wear you're comfortable with, you then go through and choose the processor, memory amount, storage, and color of your new MacBook -- just like you would a brand new one.\nAlso: Your MacBook is getting a major upgrade for free - 5 MacOS 26 features I'm trying right now\nLastly, you can choose to include a trade-in with another device as part of the purchase. This process consists of a Back Market rep appraising your device and giving you an offer in a dollar amount. You then have 21 days to ship the item to Back Market, and once they get it, they'll cut you a rebate check.\nCan you trust a refurbished item?\nI don't blame you for being wary of used tech. But keep in mind that Back Market only takes in products it knows it can resell, and even then, it has to pass a 25-point inspection test to ensure they're in good enough condition.\nThis testing, repair, and parts replacement process is what sets a refurbished MacBook apart from a used one you'd buy straight from the hands of someone on Facebook Marketplace, for example.\nBesides a few signs of wear and tear (which you can realistically expect from a device in the Fair or Good categories), the primary thing to consider is the device's battery life. Luckily, you can see your MacBook's battery capacity in the settings, along with a host of other information, including how many cycles it's gone through.\nAlso: MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air: How to decide which Apple laptop you should buy\nThe rule of thumb is to replace a battery that has dipped below 80% capacity, so a device purchased through Back Market should be above that mark, with Premium tier devices certified to be above 90%.\nThe MacBook Pro M1 I got from Back Market arrived in the Premium tier, so there was actually not a scratch or dent on the device at all. The screen looked flawless. The battery capacity was at 95%, and I had no issues with the keyboard or trackpad.\nThe only issue I experienced was that a day or two after I first set it up, it randomly booted up in recovery mode, prompting me to reinstall the latest OS. I did so, and it hasn't happened again since.\nHow much do you save?\nHere's the big question. How much are you really saving? Let's break it down based on three different comparable MacBook Pros from different generations: the M1 Pro I got from 2021, the M2 from 2023, and the latest MacBook Pro on the market, the M4 from 2024:\nCPU | Memory/Storage | Price | |\nMacBook Pro M1 14\" (Refurbished) | M1 Pro 10-core | 16GB, 1TB | |\nMacBook Pro M2 14\" (New) | M2 Pro 10-core | 16GB, 1TB | |\nMacBook Pro M4 14\" (New) | M4 Pro 10-core | 16GB, 1TB |\nThe refurbished M1 is not available new from most retailers, but you can still get new M2s from Amazon. As you can see, it's significantly cheaper -- over $600 less -- than the next generation up with comparable hardware. The difference between the M2 and M4, however, is smaller; just a few hundred dollars.\nIf you're wondering how they compare, CPU benchmarking results from Geekbench put the M1 and M2 10-core CPUs quite close together, with the M4 understandably a bit further off. These numbers refer to the CPU's performance limits under a heavy load, showing that the newer MacBooks have more power under the hood on the top end.\nAlso: The MacOS 26 public beta is here - How to install (and which models support it)\nBut the differences are not earth-shattering, here. When it comes to everyday tasks like working out of a browser, running productivity software, and multitasking with different apps across the latest MacOS, the difference in performance is not as easy to identify.\nAnd yes, the M1 MacBook Pro will be able to upgrade to the all-new MacOS 26 Tahoe when it comes out this fall, meaning it'll have the same operating system as newer MacBooks.\nGeekbench Single-Core CPU | Geekbench Multi-Core CPU | |\nMacBook Pro M1 14\" (Refurbished) | 2,451 | 10,983 |\nMacBook Pro M2 14\" (New) | 2,648 | 12,310 |\nMacBook Pro M4 14\" (New) | 3,742 | 14,693 |\nThe final verdict\nSo, should you buy a refurbished MacBook? If you want to enjoy the latest features like iPhone mirroring, the new and improved spotlight, and the liquid glass UI redesign in MacOS 26 and don't need the top-of-the-line processing power, then absolutely, yes.\nYou can get a refurbished MacBook Pro M1 with 16GB of unified memory for $841 less than a MacBook Pro M4 with a 10-core CPU. If you're not editing 4K video, animation, or rendering large image files, a top-tier processor might be overkill.\nAlso: How to make any MacOS app start at login - to save you time and clicks\nThat being said, by choosing a refurbished laptop, you'll want to carefully weigh the trade-offs. Make sure you're opting for enough local storage to future-proof your device, decide what kind of physical condition you're comfortable with, and make sure the device you choose has a healthy battery.\nLastly, keep in mind that Back Market is not the only place to purchase refurbished MacBooks, Apple has its own official refurbished store where you can purchase everything from MacBooks to iPads to Apple Watches."

This is made worse by summer temperatures being at record highs, with heat waves wreaking havoc across various states in the past few weeks. As someone who's gone through a few of these this summer alone, I'm constantly looking for ways to conserve energy.\nThere are many little things you can do that can shave dollars off your monthly energy bill, and they go beyond switching off the lights when you leave the room. Did you know you can save 3% on cooling costs for every 1\u00b0F increase in your thermostat? As a fan of data, I've looked into multiple quantifiable ways to save energy and how these translate into saving money.\nAlso: Apple's tariff costs and iPhone sales are soaring - how long until device prices are too?\nUnplugging a single device when not in use isn't going to save you a bucket of cash. But unplugging multiple devices adds up quickly to help you save, especially when you make a habit of it. Here are the devices you should unplug when they're not in use, and how doing so could save you almost $200 a year, depending on your local rates.\n1. TVs, gaming consoles, and office devices\nIt's easy to forget to unplug TVs that aren't in daily use, but it happens more often than you'd think. This is especially true if you have a TV in a guest room or common area that isn't often occupied. Simply unplugging your TVs when not in use could save you between $2 and $6 a year for each one. As soon as I learned this, I ran to unplug my guest room and office TV.\nSimilarly, a printer left plugged in can cost between $3 and $8 a year when idle. One can consume between 2W and 6W when not in use, adding another good savings option.\nAlso: These jobs face the highest risk of AI takeover, according to Microsoft\nA single gaming console like a PlayStation or Xbox can consume between 1.5W and 10W in standby power, which can cost up to a dollar each month for a device that is not in use. It's a good idea to unplug these devices when you'll be out of the house or overnight, just keep in mind that you may still want to leave them in rest mode so you don't miss an update.\nYou should also consider unplugging sound bars and speakers when not in use, especially in areas that don't get daily use.\n2. Coffee makers and kitchen devices\nUnfortunately, I learned the hard way that my Keurig coffeemaker was driving up my power bill. I kept my Keurig in standby mode, rather than asleep, so it was always ready to brew a cup of coffee. This can consume from 60W and 70W because it has to keep the water warm and ready. This can translate into up to $60 a year.\nAlso: This unexpected robot vacuum made me forget about my $2,000 Roborock\nSimilarly, a mini-fridge can cost you up to $130 a year to run, which doesn't always pay off if you don't need it to run all the time. I used to forget to refill my mini-fridge, so it ended up running empty for weeks, wasting between 50-100W of energy and costing me money. If you have a mini-fridge that you only use seasonally, like in your sunroom during summer months, it's best to unplug it when not in use. Doing so can save you over $10 a month on energy bills.\n3. Smart home devices that are mostly idle\nMost smart home devices are focused on improving energy efficiency, but they can also be vampire devices. Smart devices are always consuming energy because they remain connected to either the internet or another device, like a hub. However, smart devices tend to consume very low phantom loads, so you don't need to rush to unplug them all.\nSmart bulbs and plugs, though small, are always drawing a small amount of power, around 1W. This only costs you between $0.65-$1.30 a year, depending on your local rate, but it can add up if you have multiple of these devices, especially if you don't use them often.\nI have a lot of smart bulbs at home and I kill the switch on the ones that I know we won't be using un the near future. Similarly, I unplug my smart plugs when they don't have a device plugged into them.\nAlso: I let this Segway robot mow my lawn for months - here's why it's been irreplaceable for me\nA smart plug can often save you money on your energy bill. For example, if you have an older Keurig without scheduling capabilities that you'd like to have ready when you wake up, you can put a smart plug on it and schedule it to turn on just an hour a day. I also use my smart plugs to run a grow light for houseplants, a fan, and an older lamp.\n4. Older devices around your home\nMany people still have older devices plugged in that they haven't used in a long time, but either forgot or simply don't think twice about it. A single set-top cable box, DVR, or Blu-ray player can cost you up to $20 a year to power when not in use, depending on your local rates.\nLook around your home and see what is plugged in that doesn't need to be, including alarm clocks, cordless phone bases, electric kettles, hair dryers, and more. Unplugging these devices and only plugging them back in before using them can pay off, even if it's just a few dollars a month.\nFAQs\nMore tips to save on utilities this summer\nEven as the temperatures reach scorching highs, there are many ways to save on your utility bills this summer.\nHere are some things you can do to save money on your energy bills:\n- Run a fan instead of turning down the A/C: Your central air conditioner unit uses between 2,000W and 2,500W when running, while a ceiling fan, for example, uses around 50W. You can set your thermostat between 4-6 degrees higher during the warmer months and use a fan to save energy costs and the life of your A/C unit.\n- Keep the heat out: A warmer house takes more effort to cool, so you should make sure your windows are completely shut and your home is properly insulated. Closing the blinds and adding blackout curtains in some rooms can also maintain a cooler temperature throughout the day.\n- Switch to LED bulbs: I'm sure you've heard this before, but this is a fantastic way to save on your utility bill. LED bulbs use 80-90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and generate less heat.\n- Learn about energy savings through your utility provider: Many providers offer opportunities to save on your energy bills, especially during peak usage days and hours. Find out if your utility provider has a savings program and what you can do to participate in it.\nWhat are vampire devices?\nYou've likely heard about unplugging common household appliances and devices when not in use to save energy. Devices that consume energy even while they're switched off are aptly called 'vampire devices,' and you may have more of them in your home than you think.\nAlso: This thermostat mistake was costing me hundreds: 3 tips to get the best temperature control\nThe US Department of Energy recommends unplugging devices when not in use to reduce phantom loads. Doing so can save you up to 10% on your energy bill, which is a pretty significant amount for such little effort.\nDoes unplugging devices actually save money?\nUnplugging devices can help you save more energy than you'd think, especially if you often forget to switch off appliances like your Keurig. Many of the devices in our homes consume power even if they're not in use, and the key to saving on your energy bills lies in compounding your potential to conserve energy.\nAs someone with a whole-home backup system that sees multiple power outages a year, I make a habit of unplugging devices to save energy.

I unplug anything from smart plugs and lamps to air purifiers and robot vacuums that don't need to be used during a power outage, and I keep my home running with only 330Wh to 600Wh to extend the life of my backup battery.\nGet the best tech tips in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

As a self-proclaimed \"organized person,\" I like controlling my schedule, surroundings, and everything in between. But every time I succeed in getting my things in order, something throws me off, whether it's a new kid, a new house, or a cross-country move.\nAlso: My favorite indoor security camera has no subscription fees\nI've always preferred pen and paper, so I love my bullet journal and wall calendar. But I don't always have them with me, and I can never find a pen when I need one. This is why the Skylight Calendar has made such an impact on my life.\nWith three young kids and a dog running around the house, I often forget who needs to go where and do what at what time. This results in missed doctor appointments, which come with missed appointment fees. You've also got a variety of hot mess family staples: missed extracurricular classes, being the only kid at school without a toy during share day, double-booking activities, etc.\nI've always relied on my wall calendar, a trusty traditional paper calendar I'd get each year from Walmart, to keep me on track. But after moving across the country and buying a new house, starting new jobs, new schools, new doctors, and new everything, the paper-made decor couldn't keep up. I'd forget to add events or things I needed to get done, and the old 'out of sight, out of mind' couldn't be more accurate.\nAlso: How to securely attach an Apple AirTag to pretty much anything\nWhile looking for an alternative to my paper calendar, I started testing the Skylight Calendar last fall and realized I could never go back.\nThe Skylight Calendar is a 15-inch smart display that looks like a high-end tablet. It runs an Android-based OS and displays a calendar at all times. The Calendar can be placed on a table or shelf, or mounted to the wall. I chose the latter installation method to replace my old wall calendar.\nAlso: Can a home wind turbine replace my solar panels? My results after weeks of testing\nUsing the Skylight app on my phone, I can add events, chores, and dinner plans and create lists for everyone to see on the wall calendar within seconds. Each account also gets a custom Skylight email address that you can give to others who don't have the app. They can then send events to that email, which will be added to the calendar almost immediately.\nThis means that no matter where I am, whether on the phone with the doctor, on the way to school pickup, or at home, I can always immediately send events to my calendar on my wall from my phone.\nYou may think, why don't you use your phone's calendar app? The most significant difference between using the Skylight Calendar and a calendar on your smartphone is that it is always visible, wherever you put it. So the screen displays the calendar at all times, except when you schedule it to go to sleep, which I do at 9 p.m. each night. This makes it into a family hub where everyone, even younger kids who don't have a phone, can see what is going on and when.\nAlso: How this Roku streaming stick made my 15-year-old TV feel like new again\nYou may be glad to hear that the Skylight Calendar also auto-syncs with other popular digital calendars, like Google, Outlook, Apple, Cozi, and Yahoo.\nWhen you're not actively using the Skylight Calendar, the screen remains on unless scheduled to sleep in whichever calendar view you choose. Skylight also allows you to display photos on your calendar when idle, like a digital picture frame, which requires a Skylight Plus plan at $39 a year. I decided to skip the subscription for now. Still, it's worth noting that this option also lets you import emails or PDFs to automatically convert into events on your Calendar, which sounds pretty convenient.\nNow, onto the elephant in the room -- or on the wall. I can't gloss over the Skylight Calendar's price -- not at $320 for the 15-inch model.\nThe price was the biggest thing that kept me from buying the Skylight Calendar. Since Skylight isn't the most widely renowned brand, I was afraid I'd spend so much for a tablet that would end up bricked in a year or two when the company stopped providing support for it or something happened to it. It's not like buying a tablet from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon, where you'll know you'll get a few years' worth of use out of it.\nAlso: How these portable solar panels are saving me $30 a month - and what else to know\nI've had my Skylight Calendar for a year and a half, and the company continues to grow. The calendar has seen several updates since then, and the company released a new, larger version.\nZDNET's buying advice\nIn the end, I was lucky enough to get a review unit from Skylight, and after using it for a few months, I'm certain I would buy one for myself, even if it's $320. Skylight also sells a 10-inch Calendar at $160, an excellent option for smaller families, couples, or individuals, and the silver version is on sale for $250.\nAlso: 7 crucial rules for setting up a home security camera - and risky spots to avoid\nThe most significant selling point for the Skylight Calendar is that it provides a visual and interactive way to display your calendar and help you get organized. It auto-syncs with your phone's calendar and allows you to add events from wherever you are, so everyone at home can see them. It's gotten a lot of attention from visitors in my home, and one of my guests even bought one for themselves as soon as they saw it in action.\nWhen will this deal expire?\nWhile many sales events feature deals for a specific length of time, deals are on a limited-time basis, making them subject to expire at any time.

Keeping the battery charged between 20% and 80% and using certified chargers can help prevent overheating and stress on the battery. Additionally, unplugging devices when not in use can save energy and reduce costs, especially for appliances that draw power even when idle.",
