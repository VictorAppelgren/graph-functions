  "title": "ExxonMobil signs deal to explore for oil and gas near Trinidad despite criticism",
  "description": "PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) \u2014 ExxonMobil signed a deal on Tuesday to explore a vast area near Trinidad and Tobago for oil and gas, even as the twin-island nation f\u2026",
  "content": "The search will take place off Trinidad\u2019s east coast, in a region that spans more than 2,700 square miles (7,000 square kilometers) and is more than 2,000 feet (600 meters) deep, according to government officials.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nThere are \u201cno guarantees of success,\u201d Ardill cautioned during the ceremony. \u201cBut many of the largest discoveries and developments in the world are occurring in deep-water environments similar to what you have here.\u201d\n\nArdill said ExxonMobil is committed to starting a geophysical survey in the next six months to collect data needed to identify prospects for oil and gas, after which, it will begin drilling for testing.\n\nUsing nearby Guyana as an example, Ardill said it took the country less than five years to start producing oil after the initial discovery. He noted that 10 years after that discovery, Guyana is currently producing around 650,000 barrels of oil per day.\n\nWhile promising to help expedite the process, Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said the necessary oversight and guardrails will be in place to ensure standards are not compromised.\n\nThe prime minister said the agreement with ExxonMobil provides additional energy security for the Caribbean nation of approximately 1.4 million people. She noted that while there would be efforts to reduce carbon emissions during the project, Trinidad and Tobago would not hold back on using its energy resources.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Hemisphere developed their countries to the fullest and are now trying to put on us that we should clamp down on our carbon emissions, (that) we should look not too much to hydrocarbons,\u201d Persad-Bissessar said. \u201cTrinidad and Tobago has a competitive advantage when it comes to hydrocarbons, when it comes to the energy sector, and we should not lightly surrender that.\u201d\n\nThe ExxonMobil deal comes after a planned energy production partnership involving Trinidad and Tobago and neighboring Venezuela was halted by the U.S. government revoking two Office of Foreign Assets Control licenses for the partnership. The licenses were necessary due to U.S. sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s energy industry.",
