  "description": "Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, setting two-week timeline for Ukraine negotiations after Putin talks in Alaska.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump kicked off the week meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders at the White House \u2014 just days after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska \u2014 and said he has roughly two weeks to determine how the U.S. will proceed in the ongoing negotiations. A primary focus of the meetings was discussing various security measures to prevent Russian aggression against Ukraine again, after the Trump administration reported that Putin was on board with permitting the U.S. and its European allies to provide additional protection for Ukraine, akin to protections included in NATO\u2019s Article 5 mutual defense clause.RUSSIANS MADE CONCESSIONS \u2018ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,\u2019 TRUMP ENVOY SAYS OF PUTIN SUMMITHowever, Trump said Tuesday that sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to bolster security in the region was off the table. Meanwhile, Trump told reporters Friday that he\u2019ll have a better sense of whether a deal that ends the conflict is feasible and what kind of actions the U.S. should take moving forward on negotiations in the coming weeks. \"We'll see what happens. I think over the next two weeks, we're going to find out which way it's going to go,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"It's going to be a very important decision,\" Trump said. \"And that's whether or not it's massive sanctions or massive tariffs, or both. Or do we do nothing and say, \u2018It's your fight?\u2019\" Here\u2019s what also happened this week:Trump also joined law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington Thursday evening amid his administration's federal takeover of the city and efforts to crackdown on crime.\"We've had some incredible results and results have come out and it's like a different place,\" Trump told the police and National Guard troops Thursday. \"It's like a different city.\" Vice President JD Vance visited National Guard troops in Washington's Union Station Wednesday. TRUMP JOINS POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES IN WASHINGTON STREETS\"We are seeing really substantial effects because these guys are busting their a--,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"Right here in Union Station, you have vagrants, you have drug addicts, you have the chronically homeless, you have the mentally ill who harass, who threatened violence, who attacked families,\" Vance said. \"And they've done it for far too long. This should be a monument to American greatness.\"Trump initially mobilized 800 D.C. National Guard troops as part of his effort to reduce crime in Washington on Aug. 11. Since then, National Guard troops from Ohio, West Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee also have been tapped to support the Trump administration\u2019s effort.Trump also unveiled plans with FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the Oval Office Friday to hold the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center Dec. 5. During the event, FIFA will divyy up all the teams into 12 different groups. TRUMP ANNOUNCES KENNEDY AS FIFA WORLD CUP DRAW VENUE\"On Dec. 5 of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center. Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet \u2013 maybe in a week or so,\" Trump said.\"But right here in Washington, D.C., it's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes \u2014 the best athletes in the world \u2014 to the cultural center of our nation's capital,\" Trump said.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump said that his meeting at the White House Monday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy isn\u2019t a last attempt to help Ukraine secure a peace deal ending its war with Russia.\n\"I can never say that. It's never the end of the road,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Monday. \"People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would not say it's the end of the road. No, I think we have a good chance of doing it now. It's been almost four years now that, a lot of people were killed last week, a lot of people last week. I mean, millions of people killed, but a lot of people last week, for whatever reason, a big number, a lot of soldiers, both on both sides. And, I know the president. I know myself, and I believe Vladimir Putin wants to see it ended.\"\nTrump's comments come days after he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, Friday. Trump also said Monday that he called Putin ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy, and would call the Russian leader again after talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders wrapped up.\nZelenskyy, who hasn't visited the White House since February, is joined by other European leaders who have supported Ukraine. Leaders also in Washington include British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\nTrump told reporters that he wouldn't eliminate the possibility that U.S. troops could be deployed to Ukraine following a peace negotiation to ensure Russia upholds its end of the bargain.\nBACK FROM ALASKA, TRUMP STARTS WEEK WITH CRUCIAL FOREIGN POLICY TALKS OVER UKRAINE WAR\n\"We will give them very good protection, very good security. That's part of it,\" Trump told reporters Monday.\nTrump said more details would be forthcoming on what it would mean to deploy U.S. troops to Ukraine, and that he would be discussing the matter with other European leaders Monday.\n\"They'll all be involved, but there'll be a lot of help when it comes to security, there's going to be a lot of help, it's going to be good,\" Trump said. \"They are first line of defense, because they're there, they're Europe, but we're going to help them out also, we'll be involved.\"\nZELENSKYY OUTLINES PEACE DEMANDS BEFORE HIGH-STAKES WHITE HOUSE MEETING WITH TRUMP\nAlthough Trump said Sunday that NATO membership for Ukraine was not an option for a potential peace deal, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday that Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and other European allies to provide additional protection for Ukraine, similar to protections included in NATO\u2019s Article 5 mutual defense clause.\n\"We were able to win the following concession that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" Witkoff said in an interview with CNN."

After the meetings, Trump said Tuesday that sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to beef up security in the region was off the table.\n\"The president has definitively stated U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday.\n\"The president understands security guarantees are crucially important to ensure a lasting peace, and he has directed his national security team to coordinate with our friends in Europe and also to continue to cooperate and discuss these matters with Ukraine and Russia as well.\"\nZelenskyy said U.S. backing on security guarantees is critical to delivering stability to Ukraine.\n\"Security in Ukraine depends on the United States and on you and on those leaders who are with us in our hearts,\" Zelenskyy said Monday.\n\"We spoke about it, and we will speak more about security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This is very important that the United States gives such strong signal and is ready for security guarantees.\""

It's like a different city.\"\n\"The numbers are down like we wouldn't believe, but we believe it,\" he said.\nThis comes as Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday that there has not been a homicide in the city in more than a week, coinciding with Trump's federal takeover.\nAddressing the officers and troops assembled, Trump said, \"When I look at you people, I understand why. Because there's no games, right? We're not playing games. We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places. But we're going to stay here for a while.

It'll look like, more importantly, Trump National Golf Club.\"\n\"We're going to be rebuilding all of your parks, and it's going to happen fast. It's going to go up like a miracle,\" he said, adding, \"So you do the job of safety and I'll get this place fixed up physically.
