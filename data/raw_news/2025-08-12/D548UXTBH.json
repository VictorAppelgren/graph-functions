Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nA mouse may seem like a small consideration for your workstation setup. But after you\u2019ve addressed the crucial ergonomics \u2014 raising your monitor to eye-level, using the right keyboard and taking frequent breaks throughout your workdays \u2014 it\u2019s a good idea to make sure the mouse you use is comfortable as well. People dealing with conditions like carpal tunnel and wrist pain may be interested in finding the best ergonomic mouse for them. Vertical and semi-vertical designs turn your palm towards your midline instead of downwards, creating a handshake position that may feel more natural. Others employ a trackball to minimize the work your shoulder has to do in a day. I tested out more than 20 highly regarded ergonomic mice to come up with recommendations for vertical, semi-vertical, trackball and more, along with advice about the merits of the different ergonomic designs.\n\u2022 None What to look for in an ergonomic mouse\n\nConnection: Wired USB-A or 2.4Ghz wireless dongle models available | Power: Wired model or 2 x AAA batteries wireless model | DPI options: 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 and 2,500 | Weight: 110-130g w/o flange, 150-170g with flange | Number of buttons: 6 | Extra buttons: Forward, backward, DPI, scroll I really enjoyed using the Goldtouch Semi-Vertical mouse and it is probably the one I had plugged in the longest, just because I liked it. It\u2019s one of the few non-gaming mice I encountered with adjustable weights. I took two of the four 5g discs out to make it around 120 grams and that, combined with the easy glide, made moving it feel effortless. The cursor movement is precise at all four DPI settings and the light-up Goldtouch logo on the side turns different colors depending on which speed you\u2019ve selected (red is low, blue is medium, green is medium-fast, and purple is fast) which is far easier to discern than most mice that rely on a series of flashes to indicate speed. It has a soft-touch, rubberized exterior with smooth metallic plastic buttons that are easy to click. As a semi-vertical mouse, it puts your hand in a natural, 60-degree tilt position that, to me, feels more comfortable than the straight-up-and-down of a fully vertical mouse. My medium-sized hand can fully palm the exterior with some distance left between the tips of my fingers and the ends of the mouse buttons, so slightly larger hands should still have room. There aren\u2019t a ton of extra buttons, just left, right, scroll, DPI and forward and back browser buttons (that aren\u2019t programmable). The scroll button accurately adjusts between a slow line-by-line crawl and a page-swallowing speed run, depending on how fast you turn it. Maybe it\u2019s just the review unit I got, but the wheel occasionally made the faintest squeak, though that\u2019s starting to fade. The clicks are audible, but not annoying and the lift-off distance is just right. When you need to reposition the mouse, tilting it slightly to glide on its right edge doesn\u2019t result in errant cursor movement. The Goldtouch Semi-Vertical comes with an optional flange that attaches firmly with magnets. It adds a little weight but the mouse still glides admirably. The addition allows you to rest the heel of your palm so it moves along with you as you mouse. This is great for preventing any bending of your wrist as you move your whole arm instead. I didn\u2019t use the flange other than to test it, as moving my whole arm just aggravates my shoulder tension. Goldtouch claims that the flange also adds a little extra length to support up to eight-inch-long hands. I tested the wired mouse but Goldtouch also offers wireless versions and, in a rare nod to our sinister-handed kinfolk, wireless left-handed mice as well. All three of those models require a USB-A port so if you don\u2019t have one available and don\u2019t want to buy an adapter, you can try Perrix\u2019s Perimice 819 for a similar semi-vertical design. It\u2019s a little smaller, so medium and large hands will use more of a fingertip grip. But it glides easily, has precise movement, a rechargeable battery and connects via Bluetooth or wirelessly with either a USB-C or USB-A dongle. Plus, it\u2019s an ergonomic bargain at $35. $75 at Amazon\n\nWhat to look for in an ergonomic mouse\n\nLike everything related to ergonomics, the mouse design that works best for you will depend on your body and what you need to do on a typical day. So the shapes, added features and how the mouse communicates with your computer will determine which you should get.\n\nWhen we\u2019re talking about ergonomic mice for productivity purposes, it usually refers to mice that look distinctly different from the standard, typically with shapes that tilt your hand towards a more \u201chandshake\u201d position instead of facing your palm downward. A vertical ergonomic mouse has the most severe up-and-down angle, semi-vertical mice split the difference and trackball models stay put on your desk while your thumb controls the movement of the cursor. Gaming mice have an ergonomic category as well, but that simply refers to a mouse with curves designed to fit either the right or left hand. It differentiates those mice from ambidextrous models, which don\u2019t conform to a particular hand.\n\nEach of three ergonomic mice shapes can help address different concerns. If you\u2019re trying to avoid twisting your forearm, a vertical mouse could be what you need. Clicking a vertical mouse feels more like pinching your finger and thumb together, which could relieve certain other wrist issues as well.\n\nA semi-vertical mouse feels the most like a traditional computer mouse, with an angle closer to 50 or 60 degrees from your desk. Semi-vertical mouse clicks can feel easier too, since you're pushing down instead of pinching. Some vertical and semi-vertical mice have an optional flange that supports the heel of your palm. Instead of pivoting on those bones to make your cursor move, your palm and wrist stay aligned and the entire arm controls the motion.\n\nA trackball mouse can also keep your wrist from bending, as it keeps your forearm planted. My personal struggle is with neck and shoulder tension, so trackballs and very lightweight vertical mice work best for me as their configuration lets me keep my forearm from moving.\n\nAs this guide focuses on productivity mice, gaming-specific stats like polling rates and IPS values don\u2019t really come into play. (My colleague Jeff Dunn does a good job of explaining those metrics in his gaming mouse review guide.) What matters here are numbers like DPI, or dots per inch, which indicates how sensitive a mouse is. The higher the setting, the faster your cursor will move across the screen. Low DPI settings let you do precision work like pixel-by-pixel editing in Photoshop. All the mice here have at least two and as many as five settings, ranging from 400 to 3,200 DPI. Mice that make it easy to switch from high to low DPI might make sense if you do a lot of detailed work.\n\nWeight makes a difference in vertical and semi-vertical mice (but not trackballs, since they stay put). A lighter model will be easier to move around, which could put less strain on your wrist and arm. That said, a little weight can make your movements feel more precise. For reference, a featherweight gaming mouse might weigh 45 grams and a large vertical mouse with a flange attached might weigh 140 grams. The latter may feel a little heavy, but if it has smooth feet and is used with a decent mouse pad, it will feel lighter.\n\nIt's always nice to have easily clickable buttons, but that matters even more when body health is a concern. Pressing hard on a button tenses up my arm and shoulder like nobody\u2019s business. Since it\u2019s an action desk workers perform hundreds or thousands of times a day, it's essential that it be effortless \u2014 nothing ruled out a mouse quicker in my tests than tough buttons.\n\nAll mice have the basics: a right and left button and a scroll wheel. All mice in this guide also have a DPI selector button. Some have other functions such as a scroll wheel that can click with a press or handle horizontal scrolling by tilting the wheel to the right or left. Many also have back and forward buttons for browser windows, and sometimes those two are programmable to perform different functions in other apps.\n\nMore complex mice have additional buttons to customize, typically using a mouse\u2019s proprietary software. Depending on that software, you can set buttons to mute calls, copy and paste, undo and redo, switch tabs and more. Performing multiple functions without extraneous movement is a big plus in ergonomic design. Of course, there are a number of keyboards that let you program multiple functions into specific keys, which cuts down on superfluous movement even more, which you can read about in our ergonomic keyboard guide.\n\nAll the mice here will work with Mac's operating system as well as Microsoft Windows, and some work with Chrome, Linnux and even iPadOS (though I didn\u2019t test those) as well. They connect in three ways: Wired, via Bluetooth or with a 2.4Ghz wireless dongle. More devices have incorporated USB-C interfaces, but most mice still use USB-A. So if you have a laptop that only sports USB-C ports (looking at you, MacBook), you\u2019ll need an adapter to use a wired or dongle-enabled mouse. You can use a hub or docking station for this purpose, but in testing this guide, I ran into connectivity issues using a wireless USB receiver in a docking station, particularly when there wasn\u2019t a direct and completely clear path between the mouse and receiver. Everything worked far more reliably with just a direct USB-C to A adapter.\n\nThe difference between wireless and Bluetooth is twofold: a wireless dongle connection tends to be quicker to set up. You just plug in the accessory, turn on the mouse (potentially granting permission for the device) and you\u2019re set. For Bluetooth, you need to open the settings menu, activate pairing mode on the mouse, search for the mouse and then click connect. There\u2019s also a bit more latency when using Bluetooth versus a wireless mouse. It\u2019s not something most people will notice doing workaday stuff, but if you plan on playing some Overwatch after hours and want to use the same mouse, you might want to go with the faster, 2.4Ghz route.\n\nAfter many hours of research and reading reviews, I gathered just over 20 mice with good claims to ergonomic design to test in my work setup. I mostly tried out mice geared towards a work-from-home or office setting, as opposed to gaming (we have a whole guide dedicated to that topic). I used each mouse for a few hours or a few days, noting how well they felt as well as how they performed. I mostly used a MacBook Pro M1 but verified Windows compatibility with an Asus ROG Strix laptop. For reference, my right hand measures 7.25 inches from the wrist crease to the tip of my middle finger, which is just under average for a man and large for a woman.\n\nOther ergonomic mice we tried\n\nI was thrilled to see a gaming company announce a vertical mouse. In gaming peripherals, the term \"ergonomic\" just means \u201cnot ambidextrous\u201d as in, designed for the right (or left) hand. To be fair, Razer calls this a productivity mouse and a rep told me it was meant for those who work often and occasionally want to game with the same mouse. But still, the Pro Click V2 Vertical mouse is at least gaming adjacent and has an actual ergo design. The handshake position is nice and upright, forcing very little twisting in your forearm. It\u2019s immediately apparent how well built it is, plus it\u2019s lightweight, glides easily and nicely fits in the hand. It has three connectivity options: Bluetooth, wired or USB-A dongle. And, because this is Razer, you also get some sweet, sweet RGB lights at the bottom.\n\nUnfortunately, I think Razer\u2019s Basilisk V3 is still a better ergonomic mouse for gaming. Even though it doesn\u2019t have the tilted handshake position, I vastly preferred using it to the Pro Click V2 Vertical. The V2 Vertical has a small flange that supports the pinky, but my palm was left to pinch against the desk, so I found myself lifting my arm a lot. While the Hyperspeed dongle is quite responsive, the Bluetooth connection was consistently slow to wake. Using the mouse wired wasn\u2019t great either, as the weight of the cable was more noticeable with a tilted position. The right and left buttons required only a light touch if my hand fully grasped the mouse, but if I backed off the grip a little, the buttons were tough to click.\n\nFinally, for a gaming mouse, there aren\u2019t a ton of programmable buttons: just right, left, scroll, DPI and a forward/back pair surrounding the thumb slot. There are some great ideas here and, like most things Razer makes, the build is top-notch, so I\u2019m excited to see if the brand\u2019s next effort in the area of ergonomic gaming mouse addresses a few of this model\u2019s drawbacks.\n\nLogitech mice have made many appearances in our guides over the years. In our guide to the best productivity mice, we name the Logitech MX Master 3S the best wireless mouse you can get. As I considered its merits as a mouse, it was indeed an impressive option \u2014 it connected flawlessly, has a useful sideways wheel as well as the traditional scroll feature and the thumb rest is a nice touch. But the ergonomics didn't quite do it for me as it holds your hand in the standard, palm-down, claw-grip position.\n\nThe Logi Lift Vertical is likely one of the more popular ergonomic mice out there. It\u2019s fairly lightweight, has an attractive design with a nice feel to the exterior. The buttons are easy to click and nearly silent. It also connects quickly using either Bluetooth or a dongle. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t glide across the mouse pad all that smoothly, and the pinch grip the design requires actually aggregated my wrist. The cursor movements are fairly precise, though I occasionally had trouble getting the cursor to land just where I wanted it. Also, it\u2019s small; my hands are too large for the Lift. Logitech\u2019s Logitech MX Vertical is essentially a larger version, but again, the skinnier shape was uncomfortable in my hands and it was tough to get the cursor to go where I wanted it to.\n\nThe HP 920 ergonomic vertical also has a flange for resting your palm, but it makes the mouse overly heavy to move around. Without it, however, it's an extremely comfortable mouse with a premium feel, rechargeable battery, and two programmable thumb buttons. Unfortunately, the cursor movement was frustratingly imprecise and didn\u2019t go exactly where I pointed, forcing a number of corrections \u2014 and extraneous movement is what we\u2019re trying to avoid in ergonomic setups.\n\nApart from the rather loud clicks, I was impressed with the build and performance of the Turtle Beach Pure Air. It\u2019s lightweight, moves smoothly, and has impressively accurate cursor movements. But despite being labeled an ergonomic mouse, it\u2019s particularly light on the ergonomics. There\u2019s a divot for your right thumb, so it can't be called ambidextrous, but beyond that it\u2019s a pretty standard (albeit quite nice) gaming mouse.\n\nThe PERIMICE-719 from Perixx is a solid mouse with an exterior that feels nice to the touch. It has a comfortable, semi-vertical design, accurate cursor moves and a satisfyingly ratcheted scroll wheel. Plus, it offers reliable connectivity with a wireless dongle and only costs $22. Unfortunately, it was too small for my hand. Only folks with smaller glove sizes (or don\u2019t mind adopting more of a fingertip grip) will be able to get the most out of this one.\n\nThe Anker 2.4G mouse could make a decent budget pick for anyone who doesn't mind using more of a pinch grip on their peripheral. It's lightweight and has a precise scroll wheel along with back and forward browser buttons. It's battery operated, but doesn't come with batteries and only connects via the included USB radio dongle. I also found the buttons a little harder to press which ultimately eliminated it from the running.",

  "summary": "The ergonomic mouse is a crucial consideration for workstation setup, especially for those with conditions like carpal tunnel and wrist pain. The Goldtouch Semi-Vertical mouse was recommended by Engadget for its comfort and ease of movement. The mouse is one of the few non-gaming mice I encountered with adjustable weights and a precise cursor movement, making it feel effortless. The light-up Goldtouch logo on the side of the mouse turns different colors depending on the speed you've selected, making the mouse more comfortable. The company's optional flange flange adds a little weight but the mouse still glides. It also offers wireless versions and offers a range of left-handed mice, but requires a USBA port if you don't have one available. The best ergonomic device for 2025 is the Perimice Plus Plus Plus, an ergonomic design designed for smaller hands, priced at $35.",
  "shortSummary": "Goldtouch Semi-Vertical mouse offers an excellent ergonomic design with precise cursor movement, flexible flange, and adjustable weights, idealizing for workstation use.",

      "text": "X-Mouse Button Control (XMBC) is a free tool for Windows that allows you to re-configure and remap mouse buttons to expand the capabilities of your mouse.\nDownload:\n|\nLatest version Portable version |\nmirror mirror |\n[ Whats new? | | Language Packs | | Awards ] | ||\n|\nPlease be aware that X-Mouse Button Control is a hobby project. It is not affiliated with any mouse or trackball device manufacturer. |\nOverview:\nX-Mouse Button Control (XMBC) allows you to create application and window specific profiles. This in turn, allows you to re-configure your mouse behaviour for individual applications or windows. For each profile you can also configure up to 10 'layers' of different button configurations which you can switch between using hot-keys or mouse buttons.\nBy default, profiles are automatically activated as the mouse moves over the defined application, window or region.\nThis has many uses, for example:\n- Changing the behaviour of the mouse over certain windows, such as making the mouse wheel change volume when hovering over the system tray or you-tube video.\n- In games/programs which do not natively support the extended, 4th and 5th mouse buttons, you can map keys to each button.\nXMBC allows you to change the behaviour of the mouse buttons and scroll/tilt wheel. The extensive list of functions available to map to your mouse buttons includes options such as:\n- Send any keys using the 'simulated keystrokes' editor\n- Button Cording (shifting/combining) buttons perform different actions\n- Timed button actions, that change depending how long you hold a button down for\n- Launch any windows application\n- Clipboard control (Copy/Cut/Paste)\n- Media control (Play/Pause/Stop/Volume/Mute etc.)\n- Capture screen (or active window) image to clipboard\n- Click-Drag [Sticky buttons/keys]\n- Various support for specific Windows operating systems features, such as Flip3D in Vista, ModernUI/Metro in Windows 8 and Virtual Desktops in Windows 10/11!\n- And much, much more!\nFor more information about using and configuring X-Mouse Button Control, please check out the user guide (mirror).\nThere is also a German and Russian version of the user guide (note that they may not be completely up to date with the English version as they are provided by friendly users!).X-Mouse Button Control currently supports Windows 10 & 11 as well as Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019 & 2022 (GUI versions).\nNOTE: X-Mouse Button Control should also work on older (unsupported) versions of Windows such as XP, Vista, 7, 8, Server 2003-2012 but if there are any issues its time you upgrade your Windows installation!\nX-Mouse Button Control was originally designed to run natively on x64 editions of Windows but it is fully supported on 32bit editions too!\nThe installation determines what version is required (x64 or x86) automatically during installation.\nDonations:\nCharity:\nOver the first weekend of October 2023, I and two friends will be taking part in the 28th Club Triumph Round Britain Reliability Run.\nThe event, once again involves a 2000 mile drive around Great Britain in a classic Triumph, all in 48 hours, pretty much non-stop except for food/fuel breaks! We are again taking Andy's rather special Stag saloon, a car that is older than me (and probably in better condition!)\nThis year, the chosen charity is Huntingtons Disease Association so perhaps, instead of donating directly to XMBC, you could sponsor us instead.\nThe event normally runs every two years. Three years ago, XMBC users made a big difference to our fundraising so be sure to leave a comment mentioning XMBC so I can see how many donations are as a result of you good XMBC users.\nPlease note that donations are just that.

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nI found the best productivity mouse for work\nOf mice and me.\nA good mouse can make a bigger difference than you might think \u2014 especially if you spend hours each day clicking through spreadsheets, editing documents or working across multiple tabs. Whether you\u2019re looking to declutter your desk, ditch a worn-out clicker or finally upgrade from those old wired mice, the best wireless mice offer more flexibility, comfort, and features than ever before.\nIf you want to boost your workflow, finding the best productivity mouse is key. The right one can offer a smooth scroll wheel, customizable controls and an ergonomic design that won\u2019t wreck your wrist during long sessions. Some models are made specifically with Mac users in mind, while others cater to different preferences like left-handed use, quiet clicks or a low-profile, sleek look that blends right into your setup. Whether you prefer a rechargeable model with USB-C or a more traditional one powered by an AA battery, the best productivity mouse for you can make your workflow even more convenient.\nThe obvious candidates\nGoogle around for \u201cthe best PC mouse\u201d or \"the best productivity mouse\" and you\u2019ll find one answer: Logitech\u2019s MX Master 3. You might see a few mentions of others \u2014 like the Razer Pro Click and Microsoft\u2019s Surface Precision mouse \u2014 but the reviews are clear that this Logitech mouse is the one. Since we first published this guide, Logitech has released the MX Master 3S which improves on the already popular device with a sharper sensor and quiet clicks. We\u2019ve updated this guide accordingly to consider this high-quality good mouse.\nI looked at all three of these, and honestly, there\u2019s not a lot in it. All of them cost $100 and all of them meet my basic requirements of decent ergonomics, configurable buttons and solid battery life. The latter is the hardest to quantify thanks to how each manufacturer likes to define \u201ctime.\u201d For Logi\u2019s MX Master 3S it\u2019s \u201c70 days.\u201d Razer on the other hand touts the Pro Click as lasting between 200 and 400 hours depending on whether you use their USB receiver or Bluetooth respectively (that\u2019s 8-16 \u201cdays\u201d but it\u2019s not clear if this is \u201cin use\u201d).\nMicrosoft\u2019s Surface Precision is listed as \u201cup to 3 months\u201d which I somehow read with an implied shrug on their part. It\u2019s hard to know whether those are active use or \u201cthe device is on and it\u2019s on your mouse pad.\u201d The better news is that all of them can be charged while you use them. In practice, I found the MX Master 3S to last the longest, but also needing a charge way sooner than its 70 days claim, in my experience it\u2019s more like every 5-6 weeks.\nOf this trio, the Pro Click offers the most configurable buttons (8). The MX Master 3S is a close second (7) but has the advantage of a second scroll wheel near the thumb. In reality, two of Razer\u2019s \u201cbuttons\u201d are side-clicks on the scroll wheel \u2014 typically these default to sideways scroll, the same as Logi\u2019s thumb dial does. The net result is that I found the MX Master 3S slightly more configurable for my use cases. The thumbwheel is perfect for switching between desktops \u2014 something I do a lot, which would occupy two slots on the Razer meaning, effectively, the MX Master 3S has one more spare mouse button in this setup.\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of buttons, the new MX Master 3S wireless mouse has almost no click sound at all. It makes almost every other mouse seem quite conspicuous by comparison. It also means the click motion feels a little smoother which all adds up to a much nicer experience \u2014 especially if you work in a shared space or just prefer quiet clicks.\nLastly, there\u2019s a programmable button on the MX master 3S located just under where your thumb rests. This can be used for almost anything, but by default, it activates something called \u201cgesture control,\u201d which lets you assign certain tasks to, you guessed it, different gestures. I gave the gesture controls a spin and they seemed pretty helpful, but the usefulness soon dissolved when I found I wasn\u2019t always able to ace the gesture on the first attempt.\nFor its part, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Precision mouse offers six buttons and includes left/right clicks on the scroll wheel and three side buttons, putting it about on par with Razer and a shade under the MX Master 3S for configuration dorks like me. But it also makes for a good ergonomic mouse given the location of its controls and overall design.\nAll three companies offer companion software \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s is built right-in to Windows. It\u2019s worth noting that Logitech makes a distinction between its office mice and its gaming mice which I\u2019ll get to later (basically, different software with different configuration options). The short version is each gets its own software and what you can do there differs which will be a key factor if considering a variety of their models..\nI found Logitech\u2019s Options software the most straightforward with a deep selection of Windows commands, media controls, shortcuts and navigation tools on offer. You can also assign keystroke combinations if something you need isn\u2019t listed. On top of that there are options for app-specific buttons which means you can, for example, have right-click do one thing in Photoshop but something totally different in Chrome. Logitech doesn\u2019t offer full macros in Options though, so more complex commands are off the table via the native software.\nRazer\u2019s Synapse also offers app-specific controls alongside a wealth of predefined media and OS shortcuts, but perhaps less comprehensive than those found in Options. That said, you do also have full macro support: Simply hit record and whatever you do next can be converted into a single click of the mouse. There\u2019s even \u201cHyperShift\u201d which means you can add a second layer of commands while holding down an allocated button.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Mouse and Keyboard Center is no slouch either with some decent shortcuts on offer and support for both macros and app-specific controls. Though, overall, it\u2019s perhaps less in-depth than both Logitech and Razer\u2019s companion apps.\nOn a more minor note. During my time with MacOS I joined the dark side of \u201cnatural scroll.\u201d It\u2019s not a deal-breaker for me, as I don\u2019t mind regular scroll, but Logitech and Microsoft both offer reverse scrolling as a setting, Razer doesn\u2019t appear to \u2014 though you can work around this in other ways of course.\nAll the above mice offer the flexibility of both Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless connectivity, can be used while cabled and support multi-device (at the same time) modes, if that\u2019s your thing.\nWinner: MX Master 3S.\nGaming mice for everyday use\nJust because a mouse has a gaming focus, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the best mouse for productivity, too. That was my reasoning when I looked at things like the Logitech G502 Lightspeed and the G Pro X Superlight. From Razer, the Viper Ultimate looked like another strong option.\nThere are a few things that change once you go gamer it seems. First: Things get much much lighter. The heaviest I tried was the G502 which, at 114g is a hair heavier than the Razer Pro Click (106g). But 26g lighter than the MX Master 3S. The G Pro X Superlight and the Viper Ultra are much more svelte however, weighing in at 63g and 74g respectively. This puts the G Pro X at under half the weight of its Logitech productivity sibling.\nThe next thing to consider is the form factor. Gaming mice are much more likely to have either a neutral or ambidextrous design. This isn\u2019t a no-no for my RSI concerns (especially when offset against the lighter weight) but it was something I was cautious about. Of the ones I am testing here, the G502 Lightspeed is the most \u201cergonomic.\u201d\nLastly, gamers want speed and even 2.4GHz is a bit too laggy for some, so Bluetooth connectivity is rare to find in this category. Even the best wireless mice can struggle with latency issues. That\u2019s not a deal-breaker for me, but worth knowing in case it is for you.\nI actually had high hopes for the G502 Lightspeed. Not only is it lighter and a similar form factor to the MX Master 3S, it offers a whopping 11 configurable buttons. What\u2019s more you\u2019re able to assign full macros along with a slew of deep keyboard commands to those buttons. From a customization standpoint, it\u2019s pretty comprehensive. The G502\u2019s office-bound rival has most of what you need, but macros aren\u2019t there and the keyboard commands on offer aren\u2019t as extensive as in Logitech\u2019s gamer-focused G Hub software.\nI should mention the G Pro X Superlight here, too, given it uses the same software as the G502. The G Pro X is semi ambidextrous (you can palm it with either hand, but the extra buttons are only on one side). There are only five buttons total, too.\nThe issue for me was really all in the handling. I liked that both of these were lighter, that\u2019s a solid plus. But the wealth of buttons on the G502 meant things were a little more cramped. For example, there are two right alongside the left-click button and then another two just above where your thumb rests. They aren\u2019t hard to locate without looking, but overall not as naturally placed as those on the MX Master 3S, at least in my opinion. Also, the scroll wheel on both the G502 and the G Pro X protrudes more than any of the other mice on this list which, again, takes some getting used to. Neither was as fluid or comfortable to me as those in the MX Master 3S or Razer Pro click.\nMoreover, the G502 has a button to switch between smooth and ratchet scroll (fast, free gliding versus clicky slow, basically). The MX Master 3S offers both types of scrolling but with a setting where ratchet mode will seamlessly become smooth mode which is much more apt for browsing and navigating lists. I found scrolling on the G502 a bit annoying. Much bigger \u201cclicks\u201d and finding the button to switch to smooth seemed to kill my flow. I am guessing it\u2019s better for gamers though.\nThe G Pro X, for its part, is a really nice option if you want something light with a couple of extra buttons. But with just two additional ones over the standard two-plus-clickwheel it wasn\u2019t quite up to my requirements.\nRazer\u2019s Viper Ultimate, literally on the other hand, is a surprisingly competent all-purpose mouse. For one, as alluded to, it\u2019s truly ambidextrous. At 74g it glides across the desk making it a pleasure to use for extended periods. With a 70 hour battery life it was joint first with the G Pro X for longevity in this category (the G502 offers around 50 hours).\nThe main nitpick for me with the Viper is that the two buttons near your ring finger and pinkie take a little getting used to if you palm a mouse like I do. I had to train myself to click with the side of my finger rather than the tip. The net result is that I was surprised to find myself gravitating toward the Viper Ultimate most out of this category, despite the G502 being closer to what I had in mind when setting out on this test.\nThanks to gamery specs that I\u2019m not going to make use of, such as 20,000+ DPI sensors and 1000Hz polling rates, all of the gaming mice do cost more than the \u201cproductivity\u201d options. In fact all three cost the same: $150.\nWinner: Razer Viper Ultimate\nMobile mice\nLet\u2019s be clear, there\u2019s almost no chance any of the mobile mice on offer would make a great full-time desktop replacement. That said, it\u2019s also one of the more interesting categories thanks to being free from the burden of having to do everything. A mobile mouse can get a little wackier and do one or two things really well.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that many of us are working at home on the company laptop, so pairing that with a mouse can make the transition back to the office a little smoother (and not everyone is a fan of trackpads anyway). As such, a straight head-to-head feels less appropriate, but here\u2019s a rundown of five contenders.\nLogitech Pebble\nLogitech\u2019s Pebble is a mobile mouse in the purest form. At 100g it\u2019s not the lightest on this list, but that does give it a reassuring feel in use. There are only three buttons: The standard left click, right click and click wheel. You also have the choice between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz dongle connectivity. A nice touch is that you can stow the USB dongle under the top plate as that\u2019s also where you\u2019ll change the (AA) battery ( this model is, unfortunately, not rechargeable).\nThe Pebble has a slight angle to it which felt like my hand was arching forward when in use. The ambidextrous design is welcome but I do have my concerns about how comfortable it is for extended use. The two aces up the Pebble\u2019s sleeve, however, are its epic battery life: A claimed 18 months (though this will obviously depend on what batteries you use) and the $25 price tag, making it one of the best budget mice on this list.\nLogitech MX Anywhere 3\nAs the name suggests, the MX Anywhere 3 is the mobile version of the MX Master 3S Bluetooth mouse. Unlike its bigger brother, the Anywhere has a semi-ambidextrous design. It\u2019s perhaps a shade too small to cut it as desktop replacement, but in the mobile realm it feels premium, complete with the auto-switching between ratchet and free-flowing scroll wheel \u2014 which at $80, it should.\nWith six buttons, it\u2019s pretty configurable for something so small and at 99g it won\u2019t overstay its welcome under your palm. Though for the life of me I cannot understand why there is no option to stow the USB dongle inside the mouse somewhere. Given its mobile nature this seems like a no-brainer. You can, of course, just use Bluetooth if, like me, USB dongles seem to vanish into thin air unless they have a home.\nRazer Orochi V2\nThe winner of the most forgettable-looking option in this nest of mice goes to the Orochi V2. Or maybe it\u2019s just understated? Especially for a Razer product. Looks aside, the Orochi V2 is a very capable mobile mouse with six buttons, Bluetooth or dongle connectivity and it works with Razer\u2019s Synapse software, so any macros you might already have can be assigned here (or make your own!).\nAt 425 (2.4Ghz) or 950 hours (BLE) you get a decent amount of time out of each battery and you can use either a single AA or AAA. It weighs just 60g, so it\u2019s also pretty nimble. At $70, it\u2019s edging into full-desktop mouse territory, but given that it\u2019s big enough to actually use this full time, that seems less surprising. Especially given that you can stow the dongle under the top cover, which is more than can be said for the MX Anywhere 3 (or even the MX Master 3S).\nMicrosoft Surface Arc\nWho was betting on Microsoft having the most stylish mouse on this list? The Surface Arc is a delight with a \u201ctransforming\u201d design that pops into shape (an \u201carc\u201d no less). Once you\u2019re done simply snap it flat again for easy storage in a pocket of your laptop bag. You don\u2019t even need to turn it on as \u201csnapping\u201d it also acts as a power switch. Oh, and did I mention that the touchpad area does double duty as left/right click and vertical or sideways scroll (Magic Mouse style)? There\u2019s even the option for a \u201ctriple\u201d click to give the Surface Arc an extra, assignable button. All that, and it\u2019s only around $55.\nAs satisfying as it is to click into shape, the hollow area under the arc does mean that your thumb and little finger don\u2019t have anywhere to naturally rest. I also found the curve of the arc led me more into a claw position over my usual palm, which might be okay for you but gave me pause about using this for longer periods. As a purely mobile mouse, though, it\u2019s one of the more pleasing, especially if you like its semi-trackpad nature.\nMicrosoft Modern Mobile mouse\nThe Modern Mobile mouse is Microsoft\u2019s answer to the Pebble. Streamlined, lightweight and with a focus on the basics. There\u2019s no 2.4GHz option here though; it\u2019s Bluetooth only. At $35, compared to the Pebble\u2019s $25 it might seem a foregone conclusion but there\u2019s a lot to like about Microsoft\u2019s take on a portable mouse.\nFor one, its build quality feels far superior. It also looks more stylish (if that matters). More importantly, it has a more neutral position that feels really comfortable for a smaller mouse and doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s craning my hand forward. Throw in the fact that you can still assign app-specific controls via Microsoft\u2019s Mouse and Keyboard center and you end up with something that\u2019s smarter than it first seems.\nConclusion\nIf nothing else, I was surprised by the diversity of options despite my initial concern to the contrary. Who knew that Microsoft had such style, at least in the mobile category? Likewise, Razer, it turns out, makes surprisingly adept productivity mice despite its true-green gamer aesthetic. Logitech, on the other hand, is a steady hand across all categories.\nPredictably, the MX Master 3S does seem to do most of the things I want. BUT, only really thanks to that thumbwheel. It is particularly suited for what I need. That said, I find myself quite taken by the Pro Click, and despite lacking a second scroll wheel, it pretty much matches the MX Master 3S in every other manner. It\u2019s also lighter which is a small positive in its favor.\nFor those that prefer lightweight options (something that became more appealing to me the more I tested), then the Viper Ultimate from Razer impressed me with its balance of function and form. If you don\u2019t need as many buttons then Logitech\u2019s Pro X Superlight lives up to its name. I could happily live with either of these mice full time."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best MacBook for 2025: Which Apple laptop should you buy?\nWe tested every current MacBook Pro and Air to help you narrow down the best fit for you.\nAs expected, Apple didn\u2019t reveal any new hardware during WWDC this year. The event is typically reserved for announcing software and services upgrades, so we're not surprised. That means our recommendations for the best MacBooks remain the M4 MacBook Air for most people, the M4 MacBook Pro for creatives and the MacBook Air with the M3 chip as an excellent budget option.\nTrue, in a lineup consisting of just two models, the choice may seem straightforward. But if you\u2019re wondering what you get with an Apple laptop, or what the difference is between the consumer-grade and pro models, this guide will help. We also break down the specs to consider \u2014 like screen size, storage capacity and Apple\u2019s chip configurations \u2014 so you can pick the best MacBook for you, based on our testing and reviews.\nTable of contents\nBest MacBooks for 2025\nScreen size: 13\u201d | Processor: M4 chip, 10-core CPU, 10-core or 8-coreGPU, 16-core Neural Engine | Storage capacity (SSD): 256GB | Memory: 16GB | Battery life: Up to 18 hours | Ports: MagSafe 3 charging, 3.5mm jack, 2 x Thunderbolt 4/USB4 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 | Apple MacBook product line: Air\nRead our full Apple MacBook Air (M4, 2025) review\nSince we first put this guide together, a MacBook Air has consistently held the top spot as our recommendation for most people. The most recent model, the 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip, was in no way a surprising upgrade \u2014 but it did arrive with a welcome $100 price cut from the prior model. There hasn\u2019t been a major design shakeup since the M2 version, but Engadget's Devindra Hardawar still called the latest MacBook Air \u201ca nearly flawless ultraportable\u201d in his review.\nIt\u2019s not only our favorite MacBook, this one currently holds the honor of our best laptop overall. It has everything most users could want: A bright screen, long battery life, one of the best trackpads around and a zippy processor that\u2019s \u201ceager to get to work.\u201d All this is housed in a remarkably thin and lightweight unibody aluminum case that\u2019s a joy to hold. While Devindra didn\u2019t notice a huge difference in performance from the upgraded chip, the M4 chip did perform around 20 percent faster than the M3 in CPU benchmark tests, while the GPU gained a more modest increase in performance.\nThe screen is roomy, even on the 13-inch model, and supports the P3 wide color gamut (an upgraded organizational system for displaying color that produces more accurate and vibrant tones). It can reach up to 500 nits of brightness so you should be able to clearly see your screen even while outside on a sunny day. If you\u2019re planning on using the laptop with additional displays at your desk, you now have more screen space. The M4 MacBook Air supports two external displays with the computer\u2019s lid open, whereas the M3 MacBook Air only supported two displays with the lid closed. There\u2019s also an upgraded 12MP camera as well, so your video calls should look better. We tested over 18 hours of battery life on both the MacBook Air 13- and 15- inch models. That should get you through a full day of work and then some.\nOne of our few complaints about the MacBook Air is the lower, 60Hz refresh rate. To get up to 120Hz refresh rate (like many ultraportable PCs ship with) you\u2019ll need to upgrade to a Pro model. We\u2019d also like to see an additional port on the right side. Instead, you get two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports and a MagSafe power connection on the left. There's a lone 3.5mm jack on the right. An additional USB-C port on the starboard side would give you more options for charging and using accessories.\nAs for which configuration to get, we think most people would be happy with the base model 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage and 8-core GPU. But if you want to play more games or do media work, you may want to opt for the 15-inch model with 512GB of storage and a 10-core GPU. That configuration starts at $1,399. One thing we don\u2019t recommend is going too big on the RAM. If you think you\u2019ll need 32GB of memory, you should probably go for a MacBook Pro.\n- Lightweight but sturdy design\n- Fast performance from the M4 chip\n- Bright and clear screen\n- Great battery life\n- Still limited to a 60Hz refresh rate\n- No USB-C on the right side\nScreen size: 13\u201d | Processor: M3 chip, 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine | Storage capacity (SSD): 256GB | Memory: 8GB | Battery life: Up to 18 hours | Ports: MagSafe 3 charging, 3.5mm jack, 2 x Thunderbolt/USB4 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 | Apple MacBook product line: Air\nRead our full Apple MacBook Air (M3, 2024) review\nWith the arrival of the M4 MacBook Air, Apple\u2019s M3 MacBook Air is no longer part of the official laptop lineup. That\u2019s a departure from what the company has done in the past, which is to keep the previous model as an unofficial budget option. But it looks as though Apple is going all-in on the M4 chip for its desktop and laptop computers, likely as a way to fully support Apple Intelligence on its more powerful machines.\nWhile you can\u2019t get the M3 MacBook Air directly from Apple, plenty of third-party retailers like Amazon and B&H Photo have the older machine, and often at a significant discount. Which is why we recommend this model for students or anyone looking for a great ultraportable on a budget.\nIn Devindra\u2019s March 2024 review of the M3 model, he confirmed that it built on everything the M2 got right: a great screen and full sound in a thin and lightweight aluminum unibody that feels premium. It wasn\u2019t a huge change from its predecessor but that's a good thing. The last major updates for the M-series Air models came with the new chip in the M1 MacBook Air and the M2's body redesign, which ditched the wedge.\nThe M3 chip makes the performance impressive and, as expected, measured higher than the M2 model in our benchmark testing. The model added support for Wi-Fi 6E and it can handle two external displays with the laptop lid closed. You'll connect the extra screen via one of the two USB-C Thunderbolt/USB4 ports. (Only the Pro models have an HDMI port.)\nApple claims the same 18-hour battery life for the older model as the it does on the latest Air, and our tests confirm you\u2019ll get significantly more than a single workday before you need to grab your charger. In Devindra\u2019s tests, the machine dropped to 40 percent after ten straight hours playing fullscreen 4K video at full brightness.\nApple released both the M3-powered 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air simultaneously. We think the 13-inch model has the best combination of portability and performance. It weighs just 2.7 pounds and easily slips into a bag to take on the road. However, the 15-inch version may be worth it for those who constantly have dozens of windows open at once or dabble in media editing \u2014 though editing pros should probably opt for a MacBook Pro. The 15-inch model is also ideal for anyone dealing with visual impairment and would like an easier-to-read screen.\nAs for the screen itself, the 13-inch option has a Liquid Retina display with 2,560 x 1,664 resolution at 224 pixels per inch. That\u2019s exactly the same as the M2 Air \u2014 but again, Apple didn\u2019t mess with a good thing, sticking with a great-looking display that\u2019s bright enough to use outside in sunlight. It doesn\u2019t have ProMotion, which means the refresh rate is limited to 60Hz. If you need that silky-smooth scrolling, you\u2019ll have to bump up to a MacBook Pro.\nTo get the most out of the M3 chip, we recommend upgrading to 16GB of RAM. The new MacBook Air M4 starts out at 16GB of memory, but the older M3 model will let you go with just 8GB. That\u2019s not quite enough for more intense productivity and really doesn\u2019t work well for playing games. With the spec bump to 16GB, Devindra was able to play both Lies of P in 1080p+ and the director's cut of Death Stranding with smooth graphics at good resolutions \u2014 though he did note that you can\u2019t crank up the graphics settings too high.\nThe speakers are best-in-class and the laptop pairs quickly with Airpods. The webcam is great for video conferencing \u2014 particularly with Apple\u2019s background blurring and brightness adjustments. Finally, the responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad are the ideal interface for what adds up to be not just a great budget computer, but a great laptop in itself.\n- Lightweight yet sturdy design\n- Fast performance from the M3 chip\n- Excellent speakers, keyboard and trackpac\n- Bright and clear screen\n- No USB-C on the right side\n- Limited to 60Hz refresh rate\nProcessor: M4 chip | Storage capacity (SSD): Up to 8TB | Memory: Up to 128GB | Battery life: Up to 24 hours | Ports: HDMI, 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3, 3x Thunderbolt 5, SDXC card slo | Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 | Apple MacBook product line: Pro\nRead our 14-inch and 16-inch Apple MacBook Pro (M4, 2024) review\nApple's latest 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros may not look any different, but under the hood they're entirely new beasts thanks to Apple's M4 chips. The $1,599 14-inch model is a far better deal than before too, since it now includes 16GB of RAM standard and it has three USB-C connections instead of just two. While the M4 chip is a decent step up from the M3, the M4 Pro wowed us with Geekbench and Cinebench scores that we've never seen before. The Pro model's multithreaded performance is practically the same as two competing Windows laptops put together! (We didn\u2019t test the M4 Max, but it\u2019s most likely another stunner.)\nBeyond the new chips, the M4 MacBook Pros sport slightly brighter screens for SDR content (helpful for working in sunlight), as well as a big webcam upgrade to 12MP, instead of just 1080p. So, for the first time, the MacBook Pros can use Apple's Center Stage to keep you in frame during video chats, as well as Desk View.\nThese MacBook Pros also deliver the same excellent keyboard and super smooth trackpad that we\u2019ve loved over the last few years. They also have all the ports you need, including three USB-C, HDMI, 3.5mm jack and an SD card reader. The M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also bring along Thunderbolt 5 for faster connections to external accessories. As for battery life, both systems lasted over 30 hours in our video rundown test, and they could easily run for multiple workdays without a recharge. \u2014 Devindra Hardawar, Senior Reporter\n- Fast M4 chips\n- Brighter display\n- Sharp 12MP Center Stage webcam\n- Thunderbolt 5 with M4 Pro/Max\n- Long battery life\n- Pricey spec upgrades\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nCompared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series \u201csystem-on-a-chip\u201d condenses things even further. Prior to the M1 chip, Apple used Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and M3 generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You\u2019ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the M3 series in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple\u2019s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.\nWhile a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).\nCPU cores\nThe lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips). The burliest chip, the M4 Max is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU.\nCores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill \u2014 and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.\nRAM\nYour options for RAM, or in Apple\u2019s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That\u2019s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world\u2019s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, Apple Intelligence (still AI, but Cupertino\u2019s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM.\nYou\u2019ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.\nIn addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you\u2019re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn\u2019t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you\u2019re most likely to actually use.\nFor a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it\u2019s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.\nStorage capacity (SSD)\nStorage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you\u2019ll want more storage. If you\u2019re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it\u2019s within your budget. You\u2019ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.\nWhen Apple announced the iPhone 15, the company also announced new iCloud+ storage storage plans, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don\u2019t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it\u2019s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.\nScreen size\nThe MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget\u2019s Nathan Ingraham noted when he reviewed the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen \"makes a surprising difference.\u201d That\u2019s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won\u2019t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.\nBut screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.\nAll MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (in-plane switching, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. \u201cLiquid\u201d refers to the way the lighted portion of the display \u201cflows\u201d within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. \u201cXDR\u201d is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).\nYou also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don\u2019t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.\nCompared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It\u2019s the company\u2019s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you\u2019ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.\nPrice\nWhen Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model would start $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. Chip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don\u2019t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you.\nWe recommend the MacBook Air M4 for most people, the MacBook Air M3 for students and those on a budget, and the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pros for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you\u2019ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage to make your machine as future-proof as possible. Of course, if you're just after the M4 chip and want the cheapest route to get it, you might consider the M4 Mac mini, which starts at $599 (though you'll have to supply the screen, mouse and keyboard).\nBest MacBooks spec comparison chart\nProduct | Superlative | Tested configuration | Tested battery life | Rated battery life |\nApple MacBook Air M4 (13-inch) | Best MacBook overall | Apple M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD | 18.25 hours | Up to 18 hours |\nApple MacBook Air M3 (13-inch) | Best budget MacBook | Apple M3, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD | 20 hours (est.) | Up to 18 hours |\nApple MacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) | Best MacBook for creatives | Apple M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD | 34.25 hours | Up to 22 hours |\nBest MacBook FAQs\nWhat's the difference between MacBook Air and Pro?\nBoth the MacBook Air and Pro models come with the M4 chip. MacBook Pro models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro has a higher resolution screen with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer.\nWhat's the difference between macOS and Windows?\nMacOS is the operating system developed by Apple and used in all of its desktop and laptop computers. It can only be found in hardware made by Apple including MacBooks and iMacs. Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system can be found in the company\u2019s own Surface laptops as well as computers made by a wide array of manufacturers, like Acer, Asus, Dell and Razer."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best keyboards for 2025\nThese are the models we've tested that will work for all kinds of people.\nA good keyboard can make all the difference for your work setup. If you primarily work on a laptop, switching from the built-in keyboard to a wired or wireless keyboard can be more comfortable and ergonomic while adding functionality like extra keys and shortcuts into the mix. If your daily driver is a desktop, a keyboard will be an essential accessory that can elevate your rig whether you're using it to work a 9-to-5 with it or play AAA games in your free time.\nBut the world of keyboards is vast, and we at Engadget have tried out dozens over the years including gaming keyboards, ergonomic keyboards, mechanical keyboards and more. If you're just starting to think about the best keyboard for you, or you're ready to upgrade from an aging peripheral, we gathered all of our top picks for the best keyboards you can get right here.\nBest keyboards for 2025\nConnectivity: Bluetooth and Logi Bolt USB receiver | Size: Full-size layout | Material: Plastic chassis with low-profile scissor switches | Switches: Scissor switches | Hot-swappable: No | Backlight: Yes, smart illumination with ambient light sensors | Software: Logi Options+\nLogitech knows how to make a solid keyboard, and the Master series has been an excellent one over the past few years. The MX Keys S is the latest full-sized edition and it combines a low-profile design with comfortable keys and handy customization tools. It looks quite sleek in black, white or graphite, measuring just under 17 inches in width and only 0.8 inches high off your desk. Its spherically-dished keys cradle your fingertips every time you press, and while I wouldn\u2019t go so far to say they totally prevented me from putting any typos in this guide, the shape definitely helps more than other, flatter keycaps I\u2019ve used.\nThis is a backlit keyboard with \u201csmart illumination,\u201d which just means the backlight will kick on when your hands approach the board and adjust depending on the lighting in your environment. I have a decent amount of natural light in my home office during regular working hours, so I opted to turn the backlight off \u2014 if you do the same, you can get up to five months of battery life out of the MX Keys S (Logitech estimates 10 days with smart illumination on). The keyboard has a built-in USB-C port for charging as well.\nIn addition to the low-profile design that still includes a number pad, the biggest kickers for the MX Keys S are its wide compatibility and customizable features with Logi Options+. This peripheral works with Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Linux and iPadOS, and it has three device pairing buttons so you can connect it to up to three devices at once and switch between them as necessary. Logi Options+ is free software that many Logitech accessories use, and for the MX Keys S, it allows you to customize brightness levels and duration, set smart actions (one-key shortcuts you program to your liking) and more.\nThe Master Series also includes a \u201cmini\u201d version of this keyboard that nixes the number pad and $10 from the price tag. I\u2019ve used that and enjoy it as well, but when you\u2019re only saving $10, the full-sized version feels like a better value. Can you find cheaper wireless keyboards than either of these? Of course. But Logitech\u2019s expertise in this space really shines in the Master series, and with the MX Keys S in particular as it stands out as a high-quality wireless keyboard with a bunch of extra features at a decent price. \u2014 Valentina Palladino, Deputy Editor\n- Good build quality\n- Comfortable typing experience\n- Logi Options+ provides a ton of customization options\n- Works across all major OSes\n- Not the cheapest keyboard out there\n- Not a big price difference between the full-sized version and the mini model without the number pad\nConnectivity: Bluetooth and Logi Bolt USB receiver | Size: Compact (75% layout) | Material: Plastic frame with retro-style keycaps | Switches: Mechanical switches | Hot-swappable: No | Backlight: No | Software: Logi Options+\nLogitech\u2019s Pop Icon Keys takes a lot of notes from the Master series and translates them into a more fun (and cheaper) package. The $50 keyboard doesn\u2019t include a number pad, but instead has a row on the right side that includes four buttons that you can customize using Logi Options+. I have mine programmed to activate macOS\u2019 mission control, open the emoji keyboard and to move page up and down, respectively. But those aren\u2019t the only buttons you can customize \u2014 11 of the top function keys can also be programmed to your liking as well.\nThe Pop Icon keycaps have a slight indentation to them, though not as dramatic as those on the Master series keys, and the typing experience is a comfortable and quiet one overall. While this isn\u2019t billed as a travel keyboard, it\u2019s small enough to fit into a standard work bag or backpack, so you could take it with you without much hassle.\nYou can connect the Pop Icon keys to up to three devices at once and switch between them easily, and the keyboard supports macOS, Windows, Linux, Chrome, iPadOS, iOS and Android devices. Besides there being no option for a number pad configuration, arguably the biggest downside to this keyboard is the fact that it runs on two AAA batteries. Logitech estimates it will last up to three years before you need to replace them, so maybe that\u2019s a pro for some rather than a con. I also appreciate that, when connected to a Mac computer over Bluetooth, you can still monitor the Pop Icon Keys\u2019 battery life from the Bluetooth menu.\nThis is also a great price for a solid wireless keyboard. Logitech itself makes even cheaper ones, but the Pop Icon Keys strikes a good balance between design and capabilities at this price point. The biggest question, if you choose this keyboard, is which colorway you fancy the most out of the five options. \u2014 V.P.\n- Cheap!\n- Compact design with a low profile\n- Comfortable typing experience\n- Programmable keys with Logi Options+\n- Works across all major OSes\n- Key travel could be better\n- No number pad\nConnectivity: Bluetooth and Logi Bolt USB receiver | Size: Full-size with integrated numeric keypad | Material: Plastic frame with fabric-covered wrist rest | Switches: Scissor switches | Hot-swappable: No | Backlight: No | Software: Logi Options+\nRead our full guide to the best ergonomic keyboards\nThe Ergo K860 from Logitech combines four helpful ergonomic features in a keyboard that operates much like any standard board. The Alice split shifts your elbows apart while keeping your forearms and wrists lined up. The tenting raises the keys upward in the middle, rotating your palms subtly toward one another. The optional negative tilt slopes the bottom edge above the top edge to keep the backs of your hands straighter. And there\u2019s a palm rest built in, which some find more comfortable during long typing sessions.\nUnlike other more aggressively ergonomic boards, there\u2019s no learning curve here. Typing on the Ergo K860 feels a lot like typing on a standard set of keys. The low profile, scissor-switch keys are springy and easy to hit. You even get a ten-key number pad, navigation keys and arrow buttons, all of which make it a full-featured and familiar accessory. You can program the keys with Logitech\u2019s software, but this will likely appeal most to those who just want a plug-and-play board for a Mac or PC setup. \u2014 Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter\n- Rotated, tented keys make typing comfortable\n- An ergonomic board with no learning curve\n- Wirelessly connects quickly to three devices\n- Hotkeys work with MacOS and Windows\n- Wrist rest is not removable\n- Takes up a lot of space\nConnectivity: Wired (USB-C) | Size: Split ergonomic layout with 52 keys | Material: Plastic housing | Switches: Kailh Choc low-profile switches (tactile, linear, or clicky) | Hot-swappable: Yes | Backlight: No | Software: Oryx and VIA\nRead our full guide to the best ergonomic keyboards\nIf you\u2019re ready to make a serious commitment to increasing your ergonomics, I recommend the ZSA Voyager. I use it every day and, even though it\u2019s not super portable, I brought it with me when I worked away from my home office for a week. But at first, it took me at least three weeks before I was comfortable typing on it. Not only will you need to reprogram the keys (and remember what they do), you\u2019ll need to use your fingers in a different way than you\u2019re used to. For one, your thumbs will do far more than just hit the spacebar. They\u2019ll operate the return, shift, control and even layer buttons, depending on how you program the board.\nBut the ergonomic benefits are equally significant. The fully split board lets me open up my arms and chest. On days when I\u2019m feeling particularly tight, I\u2019ll put the two halves a full foot apart. Relocating the return, command and forward-delete key to the thumbclusters saves me from shifting my hands around the board and the layers function allows for far more functionality than a standard keyboard.\nThat said, it also adds to the security of my computer, making it all but impossible for other people to type with the Voyager. It comes with magnetic knobs for the center tenting feature, but I wish it came with the option to lift the middle a little higher. I created extra lift by adding rubber bumpers to the board, but for the price, it\u2019d be nice not to have to MacGuyver it. Still, whenever I\u2019m forced to use a regular keyboard, I feel like I'm toiling in the typing pool at Sterling Cooper. \u2014 A.S.\n- Ergonomic, fully split board\n- Programmable thumb cluster minimizes hand travel\n- Low profile, mechanical keys make typing easy\n- Compact size and clever key mapping keep your hands in the home position\n- Takes a couple weeks to relearn how to type\n- Center tenting could be higher\nConnectivity: 2.4 GHz wireless, Bluetooth 5.1, and USB-C wired | Size: 75% layout | Material: Aluminum top case with PC plate | Switches: Gateron Jupiter switches | Hot-swappable: Yes | Backlight: South-facing RGB LED | Software: QMK/VIA\nRead our full guide to the best mechanical keyboards\nThe Keychron Q Max series doesn\u2019t come cheap, but it has just about everything we want out of a high-end mechanical keyboard. Its full aluminum case is exceedingly sturdy, hefty and cool to the touch. While its PBT-coated keycaps are on the taller side, they have a lovely texture and are sculpted in a way that gently hugs your fingertips. There are multiple switch options available, all of which are hot-swappable, while a double gasket-mount design inside the keyboard gives each press a cushioned yet springy feel by default. Combined with several layers of foam, those presses have a delightfully poppy and even sound.\nWe tested the tenkeyless Q3 Max, but Keychron offers several other size and layout options as well. Each can connect over a wireless dongle, Bluetooth or USB-C and includes extra Windows- and Mac-specific keycaps in the box. There are still things to nitpick \u2014 there\u2019s a faint bit of rattle to a couple of the larger keys; you can\u2019t adjust the keyboard\u2019s height; and Keychron\u2019s one-year warranty is pretty short \u2014 but if you just want to buy a mechanical keyboard that delivers a premium experience from the jump, this will get you there. \u2013 Jeff Dunn, Senior Reporter\n- Superb typing feel and sound\n- Premium aluminum case\n- Crisp PBT keycaps\n- Hot-swappable\n- Reliable wireless performance\n- Tons of layout options\n- Knob!\n- A bit pricey\n- Keycaps aren't shine-through and may be too tall for some\n- Heavy\n- Slight rattling with some stabilizers\nConnectivity: USB-C wired | Size: Tenkeyless (80%) layout | Material: Plastic frame | Switches: Keychron mechanical switches | Hot-swappable: No | Backlight: Red LED | Software: QMK/VIA\nRead our full guide to the best mechanical keyboards\nWe recommend the Keychron C3 Pro if you want to spend as little as possible for a delightful mechanical keyboard. It\u2019s a stellar value at just under $50, with factory-lubricated switches, a gasket mount, multiple layers of internal foam and other touches we don\u2019t usually see in this price range. The stabilizers avoid any aggressive rattling, and there\u2019s none of the pinging noise you get from many cheaper cases. All of this helps feel comfortable for typing, while the tactile Brown switches in our test unit sound pleasantly clacky.\nAs with any budget keyboard, you have to make some sacrifices. It only works wired, for one, and the ABS keycaps feel slicker and cheaper than the best PBT caps. While the case doesn\u2019t exhibit any serious flexing, it\u2019s still made of plastic. You also need to pay $10 extra to get a version with RGB backlighting and hot-swappable switches \u2014 the base model is still a great buy for those looking to get into the hobby on the cheap, but it saddles you with a red-only backlight and prevents you from easily popping in new switches down the road. \u2013 J.D.\n- Inexpensive\n- Tremendous typing experience for the money\n- Programmable with software\n- Shine-through keycaps\n- ABS keycaps are a bit slick\n- Wired only\n- RGB lighting and hot-swappable switch cost a little bit extra\nConnectivity: USB-C wired | Size: 80% layout | Material: Plastic or zinc alloy case options | Switches: Lekker Hall-effect analog switches | Hot-swappable: Yes | Backlight: Per-key RGB with customizable LED bar | Software: Wootility\nRead our full guide to the best gaming keyboards\nThe Wooting 80HE is our favorite keyboard for gamers thanks to its magnetic Hall effect switches, which can respond to varying levels of pressure. This lets you customize the actuation point of each individual key, so you could make them more sensitive during quick-twitch shooting games or more deliberate when you just want to type. Another feature called rapid trigger lets you repeat inputs faster, without having to wait for a given key to return to a fixed reset point. That can be a real boon for, say, strafing back and forth more precisely during a 1v1 shootout in Overwatch. You can also tie multiple commands to one key: In Halo Infinite, for example, you could make it so lightly pressing W makes you walk more stealthily, while pressing it all the way down makes you run at full speed.\nDoes everyone need all of this? Of course not. Any keyboard can be a \u201cgaming keyboard,\u201d and nothing here will magically make you good at games. But for more hardcore types looking for any extra bit of granular control, they can make a tangible difference.\nThe 80HE isn\u2019t the only keyboard to offer this set of tricks, but it stands out for getting the rest of the package right as well. Wooting\u2019s Wootility software is best-in-class, making it particularly easy to tweak settings and customize the RGB lighting. You can save multiple control profiles directly to the device. And while the all-plastic case isn\u2019t the highest-quality thing out there for $200, the stock hardware still feels and sounds pleasant, with crisp PBT keycaps, smooth pre-lubed switches and a pleasingly thocky tone. \u2013 J.D.\n- Magnetic switches are deeply versatile for gaming\n- Easy-to-use software\n- Sturdily built\n- Comfortable for typing and sounds pleasant\n- Wired-only\n- A bit expensive\n- 80 percent design is somewhat awkward\n- Only available to buy in batches\nConnectivity: 2.4 GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and USB-C wired | Size: Tenkeyless (TKL) layout | Material: Aluminum top plate with plastic base | Switches: OmniPoint 2.0 adjustable mechanical switches | Hot-swappable: No | Backlight: Per-key RGB | Software: SteelSeries GG\nRead our full guide to the best gaming keyboards\nIf you want the Wooting 80HE\u2019s gaming-friendly features in a wireless keyboard, we like the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless (Gen 3). It offers most of the same adjustable actuation and rapid trigger tools as the 80HE, plus a \u201cprotection mode\u201d that makes it harder to hit nearby keys by accident and preset profiles for some popular games. The typing experience is a plus as well, with crisp and easy-to-reach PBT keycaps, a sturdy aluminum top plate and smooth-feeling switches that are sufficiently muffled. There\u2019s a magnetic wrist rest in the box, and the whole thing can connect over a wireless dongle, Bluetooth or USB-C.\nOur main issues with the Apex Pro involve SteelSeries\u2019 GG app. So much of the experience with these analog-style keyboards comes down to software, and GG is a bit less refined than Wootility across the board. At $270, the Apex Pro is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum, too. Still, the app is easy enough to grok over time \u2014 especially compared to other gaming models we\u2019ve used \u2014 and the board as a whole gets much more right than wrong. \u2013 J.D.\n- Fast and deeply versatile magnetic switches\n- Useful OLED display\n- Pleasant typing experience\n- Multiple connection modes\n- Pricey\n- Software isn't always intuitive\n- Battery life could be better\nWhat to look for in a keyboard\nDesign\nSize\nThe first thing you\u2019ll want to consider when it comes to your next keyboard\u2019s design is size. There are a number of different keyboard layouts to choose from, but the most common are full-sized, tenkeyless and those smaller than tenkeyless.\nFull-sized keyboards, or 100 percent, include a function row at the top and a complete number pad with arrow keys on the right side, along with all of the rest of the alphanumeric keys you\u2019d expect. Tenkeyless, or 80 percent, removes the number pad but keeps the arrow keys and the function row, reducing the overall width measurement of the board by a decent amount. Compact keyboards keep things ultra simple by including only the alphanumeric keys and modifiers like Alt, Shift, Ctrl and others and they come in different sizes like 60 percent, 65 percent and more. These are the most popular sizes out there, but you can find plenty of other designs that include different mixes of keys along with the standard letters and numbers all should have.\nAside from size, there are two other big categories that you could use to define a keyboard: ergonomic and mechanical. Ergonomic keyboards are designed with, you guessed it, better ergonomics in mind, taking into account where you should position your fingers, hands and forearms to maintain proper posture. Separately, mechanical keyboards use mechanical switches (of which there are many types) that differ greatly from the membrane or scissor-switch keyboards you\u2019ll find dominating most wired and wireless options widely available today. We have guides to the best ergonomic keyboards and best mechanical keyboards, but we\u2019ll summarize what you need to know about both here.\nErgonomic keyboards\nIf you deal with discomfort from working at a computer all day, ergonomic keyboards can help. These specially designed boards re-orient the keys, allowing you to hold your elbows farther apart and maintain a straighter line from your forearms to hands. Some people find this subtle change more comfortable.\nErgonomic keyboards typically fall into two categories: Alice and split keyboards. The former is a single unit with an A-shaped gap in the center of the keys. Split models come in two separate pieces which you can arrange as you like on your desk. Additional ergonomic features like tenting and negative tilt can make typing feel even more comfortable, and are often available on both Alice and split boards. Tenting raises the middle of the keys up so your hands take on more of a \u201chandshake\u201d position. Negative tilting lowers the top of the keyboard to keep your wrists angled downward instead of back towards your forearms.\nThe way the keys are arranged on the keyboard may make typing easier as well. Traditionally, keyboards are staggered, with one row of letters slightly offset from the row beneath it. Columnar keyboards arrange the keys in a grid of rows and columns. This style takes a little getting used to, but some people find it allows them to type faster. You can also make the keys of some keyboards do more than just produce letters. Programmable boards let you map shortcuts and other functions, which may keep you from reaching for the mouse quite so often, saving you time and possibly strain as well.\nMechanical keyboards\nMechanical keyboards have blown up in popularity as more people have been thrust into creating their own workspaces at home. It\u2019s easy to see why: Compared to a traditional membrane keyboard, a good mechanical board is more durable, more satisfying to press and, most importantly, infinitely more customizable. The best of them usually come with a price premium, but even some cheaper models let you \u201chot-swap\u201d between keycaps, switches and other materials, letting you tinker with different typing sensations and sound profiles until you find a combination that best expresses your preferences.\nDo you want each press to feel deep and full or fast and light? Do you need them to sound loud and clacky or almost totally muffled? Do you prefer your keycaps to look subdued and professional, stuffed with RGB lights or written in an Elvish language from The Lord of the Rings for some reason? With the right new keyboard, it\u2019s all up to you \u2014 the only things really holding you back are your imagination and your wallet.\nWe have a dedicated buying guide that digs deeper into the key aspects to consider when buying a mechanical keyboard, so we encourage you to look at that for a full rundown. To keep things high-level, the most influential part of your purchase is your keyboard\u2019s switch type. These little mechanisms slot underneath the keycaps and generally have the biggest effect on how your keyboard feels and sounds as you type away.\nYou can broadly separate mechanical switches into three buckets: linear, tactile and clicky. Linear switches feel smooth all the way down; they\u2019re often popular with gamers since they tend to be light and fast to actuate. Tactile switches create a tangible \u201cbump\u201d sensation partway through a press; many people who spend all day typing prefer them because they clearly confirm each press without (always) being all that loud. Clicky switches are functionally similar to tactiles but make an audible \u201cclick\u201d sound to match the bump; your coworkers may hate them, but others love the full-throated sense of feedback they provide. To be clear, just because two switches fall within the same bucket doesn\u2019t mean they feel or sound exactly the same. The only way to figure out which switch works best for you is to do your research and, preferably, try some out for yourself.\nOther keyboards have a mechanical-style feel but are built on different mechanisms entirely. The hot new trend in gaming-focused keyboards, for example, is Hall effect switches, which use tiny magnets to register keystrokes and let you customize the sensitivity of each press. Optical switches, meanwhile, offer similar functionality by replacing the physical contact point of a typical mechanical switch with a beam of infrared light. More recently, we\u2019ve seen a couple keyboards launch with inductive switches, which can work like magnetic switches but use inductive coils in the keyboard\u2019s printed circuit board (PCB) to cater to all switches collectively and don\u2019t require a sensor for each individual switch. We touch on a couple of magnetic-switch keyboards in our picks below, but for a fuller breakdown of this sort of tech, we recommend you check out our dedicated buying guide to the best gaming keyboards.\nConnectivity\nYou\u2019ve got two options here: wired or wireless. Wired keyboards typically have an attached cable that plugs into a USB-A or USB-C port on your computer (or docking station), although some come with cables that can be removed. Wireless mechanical keyboards connect to your machine either via Bluetooth or a wireless receiver dongle. There\u2019s always the chance of some latency with wireless keyboards, so keep that in mind if you\u2019re picking one up to use primarily with a gaming PC. Of course, you\u2019ll only have to worry about battery life with Bluetooth keyboards."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best gaming mouse in 2025\nPicks for your FPS, MMO and general playing needs.\nNo gaming mouse will magically stop you from getting destroyed in Counter-Strike or Call of Duty, but the right pick can give you a greater sense of control while making your downtime more comfortable. In truth, which one is \u201cbest\u201d for you comes down to preference: Shape is king, as the mouse nerd adage goes, and everyone\u2019s hands are different. But to make things a little easier, we\u2019ve tested dozens of well-regarded gaming mice over the past couple of years and picked out a few options that have glided above the rest. After playing countless hours of CS2, Overwatch 2, Halo Infinite, Final Fantasy XIV and more PC games, here are our picks for the best gaming mice you can buy, broken down by shape and use case. We\u2019ve also included some general advice to keep in mind during your search.\nThe best gaming mice\nConnectivity: Wireless, wired (USB-C) | Shape: Symmetrical | Weight: 54 grams | Dimensions: 5 x 2.51 x 1.57 inches | Sensor: Razer Focus Pro 35K Optical Sensor Gen-2 | Switches: Razer Optical Mouse Switches Gen-3 | Maximum polling rate: 8,000Hz | Programmable buttons: 6 | Battery life (rated): Up to 95 hours at 1,000Hz\nIf money is no object, the best gaming mouse with a symmetrical design that we\u2019ve tested is the Razer Viper V3 Pro. It costs a hefty $160, but it\u2019ll give you little to complain about if you play a ton of competitive PC games and can stomach the price.\nWith its lightly grooved sides, noticeable but not aggressive hump and gentle flare-outs toward the back, the Viper V3 Pro\u2019s shape should be comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types. It\u2019s a bit on the wider side, and it probably works best with a claw or palm grip, but it\u2019s not so large or tall that it can\u2019t accommodate fingertip grippers. The main mouse buttons are contoured in a way that gives your fingers a natural resting place, and there are little ledges on either side to subtly nudge them to the right spot when you\u2019re scrambling in-game. Put another way, this is one of the safer shapes we\u2019ve tested.\nThe Viper\u2019s build quality is excellent. It\u2019s impressively light at 54 grams, which makes it a breeze to flick around in fast-paced games, yet its matte plastic frame isn\u2019t covered in dust-inviting holes like many other options around the same weight. We\u2019ve seen zero hints of creaking, flexing or rattling after months of testing. The finish picks up some finger smudges but is grippy and delightfully soft to the touch. The main click buttons use durable optical switches but aren\u2019t especially loud. Though they aren\u2019t quite as full or crisp as the absolute best mechanical switches, they\u2019re still snappy to press, neither too firm nor too light. The two programmable side buttons are well-sized and easy to reach. The scroll wheel, meanwhile, is tight and quiet, with clearly defined steps and a textured finish.\nPerformance, as is the case with many high-end gaming mice these days, is effectively flawless. Razer\u2019s Focus Pro 35K Optical Sensor Gen-2 \u2014 say that five times fast \u2014 is basically overkill from a technological perspective but makes the mouse exceptionally accurate and consistent all the same. It\u2019s aided by amply-sized, smooth-gliding PTFE feet and a rock-solid connection to an included \u201cHyperPolling\u201d dongle. The latter lets the mouse reach a maximum polling rate of 8,000Hz, but as noted below, few people will actually noticed any benefit from jumping that high. Mostly, it\u2019ll just zap battery life: Razer says the Viper V3 Pro can get up to 95 hours at 1,000Hz, which is fine for this market and roughly consistent with our experience, but that drops to just 17 hours at 8,000Hz.\nIf the price didn\u2019t make it obvious, the Viper V3 Pro is for gaming enthusiasts. As such, it gives up some of the perks you\u2019d find on more mainstream mice: There\u2019s no RGB lighting or Bluetooth, while the power button/DPI switcher is located on the bottom of the device to make it harder to hit by accident. Since the device uses a special dongle instead of a traditional receiver, it still requires you run a separate USB-C cable from your PC or gaming laptop. You can connect over that cable when the battery is low, thankfully, but it\u2019s relatively thick. And while Razer\u2019s Synapse software makes it simple enough to adjust settings, it\u2019s something of a resource hog. It\u2019s also Windows-only. These are all nitpicks, though. The Viper V3 Pro is outstanding, and it should feel right at home in the hands of committed FPS players.\n- Exceptional performance\n- Superb build quality\n- Comfortable for most grip types and hand sizes\n- Expensive\n- Bit of a fingerprint magnet\n- Thick charging cable\nConnectivity: Wireless, wired (USB-C) | Shape: Symmetrical | Weight: 41 grams | Dimensions: 4.64 x 2.4 x 1.5 inches | Sensor: PixArt PAW3395 | Switches: Omron Optical | Maximum polling rate: 8,000Hz (with optional dongle) | Programmable buttons: 5 | Battery life (rated): Up to 75 hours at 1,000Hz\nThe Hitscan Hyperlight is a fantastic alternative to the Viper V3 Pro for those who want something smaller and less expensive. It has a similarly safe shape with a modest centered hump, only its sides are a little straighter toward the top. The main difference is that it\u2019s thinner and much shorter, with a noticeably lower button height, so it\u2019s best suited to those with smaller hands and/or fingertip or claw grippers. If you have bigger hands and use a palm grip, it won\u2019t be as accommodating as our top pick.\nThat said, it\u2019s a fair bit lighter, weighing just 41 grams. That makes it a breeze to quickly swipe around, though part of why the Hyperlight is so\u2026 hyperlight is because it has large cutouts on its bottom. This exposes some of the mouse\u2019s electronics to potential dust and debris on your desk. That said, we\u2019ll take this sort of design over mice with holes in the top shell, since you\u2019ll almost always keep your mouse face-down anyway.\nThe rest of the Hyperlight\u2019s design is totally sturdy, with no looseness or rattling when you give it a shake. The matte plastic finish is nicely crisp, and we dig the minimalist aesthetic of the thing. We also love its Omron optical switches, which have a lovely bounce to them and create a deeper, more even tone than the Viper V3 Pro\u2019s main clicks. Overall performance is exceptional \u2014 as is the case with most modern gaming mice \u2014 and the PTFE feet move smoothly, though you have to install them yourself. The scroll wheel has clearly defined notches as well, though it can get a little loud with heavier spins. The side buttons feel and sound cheaper than those on the Viper, too, and battery life is a bit shorter (albeit still fine) at 75 hours or so. The included cable could also stand to be more flexible, though it\u2019s certainly usable.\nHitscan is a fairly new US-based company and the Hyperlight is its first product, so you\u2019re taking a little leap of faith here. But other reviewers we trust have also been impressed, and the user feedback we\u2019ve seen around the web has been overwhelmingly positive. The price helps: At $90, it\u2019s not cheap, but it\u2019s well below other premium options like the Viper V3 Pro (You can buy a dongle that enables 8,000Hz polling rate support for $25 more, but you don\u2019t need it.) If you want a smaller performance mouse and can live with the hole-y underside, it\u2019s superb. Note that Hitscan sells it in batches, though, so you may run into stock issues at some point.\n- Comfortable for fingertip and claw grips and smaller hands\n- Excellent optical switches\n- Lightweight\n- Decent value\n- Holes in baseplate leave interior open to dust and debris\n- Fairly short for palm grips with larger hands\n- Cable could be more flexible\nConnectivity: Wireless, wired (USB-C) | Shape: Right-handed | Weight: 63 grams | Dimensions: 5 x 2.67 x 1.73 inches | Sensor: Razer Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensor | Switches: Razer Optical Mouse Switches Gen-3 | Maximum polling rate: 8,000Hz (\"classic base\" model requires optional dongle) | Programmable buttons: 6 | Battery life (rated): Up to 90 hours at 1,000Hz\nIf you want a premium gaming mouse with a more ergonomic shape, get the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro. It packs most of the same strengths as the Viper V3 Pro but has a taller, slightly wider and more dramatically flared design that\u2019s tailored to right-handed users. Most people with medium to large hands should find it to be a natural fit with a palm or claw grip, though it\u2019ll probably be a touch too fat for smaller-handed folks and fingertip grippers. This kind of shape isn\u2019t as easy to whip around as the Viper, but its high, sideways-sloping hump should provide a more relaxing place to rest your hand over the course of the day.\nRazer sells two variants of the DeathAdder V3 Pro: one with a similar soft-touch finish as the Viper V3 Pro, and one with a more textured matte plastic coating. We tested the latter \u2014 it\u2019s not as grippy or smooth to the touch as the Viper, but it\u2019s still good, and it\u2019s much less of a fingerprint magnet. The DeathAdder\u2019s side buttons are bigger, closer together and a smidge less tight, but they\u2019re still difficult to hit by accident. The PTFE feet are smaller but still glide reliably. The design is heavier at 63 grams, too, but it\u2019s still lightweight. And while the sensor is technically a generation older, performance is effectively flawless.\nOtherwise, you\u2019re looking at a similar feature set. The optical main buttons are satisfying and consistent but not overly sensitive. The lightly notched scroll wheel is soft, quiet and resistant enough, if not firm. Battery life is rated at a decent 90 hours, and you can connect a lighter and more flexible USB-C cable in a pinch. Both versions of the mouse also support polling rates up to 8,000Hz, though only the SKU with the \u201csmooth-touch\u201d texture comes with a wireless dongle that enables those higher rates in the box. The textured \u201cclassic base\u201d model comes with a smaller USB receiver that \u201conly\u201d goes up to 1,000Hz, but since it\u2019s often available for less at third-party retailers, it\u2019s probably a better value. In general, the biggest knock against the DeathAdder V3 Pro is that it\u2019s expensive, with the 8,000Hz model priced at $160.\n- Top-shelf performance\n- Lightweight\n- Comfortable for those with medium to large hands\n- Expensive\n- Naggy software\n- Not ideal for smaller hands\nConnectivity: Wireless, wired (USB-C) | Shape: Right-handed | Weight: 55 grams | Dimensions: 4.81 x 2.55 x 1.63 inches | Sensor: Razer Focus X 26K Optical Sensor | Switches: Razer Optical Mouse Switches Gen-3 | Maximum polling rate: 8,000Hz (with optional dongle) | Programmable buttons: 6 | Battery life (rated): Up to 100 hours at 1,000Hz\nThe newer Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed, which costs $99, is a \u201c1B\u201d pick here. Although it\u2019s positioned below the Pro in Razer\u2019s lineup, it\u2019s more of a \u201cDeathAdder V3 Pro Mini\u201d than a clear downgrade. It doesn\u2019t give up the rechargeable battery, cutout-free shell, optical switches and soft (if smudge-heavy) coating of pricier DeathAdder V3 Pro, and while its sensor is technically worse, it still performs wonderfully. Its battery life rating is actually 10 hours higher at 1,000Hz, plus it has a built-in storage compartment for its USB receiver. The major difference is that it\u2019s lighter (55g) and more compact, with a lower-profile scroll wheel and a marginally shorter hump. If your hands are on the smaller side and you want an ergonomic shape, it\u2019s worth grabbing instead.\n- Lighter and more affordable than DeathAdder V3 Pro\n- Smooth, grippy finish\n- Decent value\n- Smaller size isn't as friendly to larger hands as DeathAdder V3 Pro\n- Naggy software\n- Short and fairly stiff charging cable\nConnectivity: Wired (USB-A) | Shape: Right-handed | Weight: 49 grams | Dimensions: 4.65 x 2.38 x 1.46 inches | Sensor: PixArt PAW3395 | Switches: Kailh GX | Maximum polling rate: 8,000Hz | Programmable buttons: 6 | Battery life (rated): N/A\nIf you don\u2019t mind connecting over a cable, our favorite wired gaming mouse with a symmetrical design is the Endgame Gear OP1 8K. It weighs just 50 grams and has a simple design with flat sides, no holes and a reasonably-sized hump sloping down the back. It\u2019s a bit smaller and more narrow than most mice we\u2019ve tested, so it\u2019ll be comfiest with a claw or fingertip grip, though a palm grip can also work in smaller hands. The whole thing is incredibly sturdy, with no flex or rattle, while the smooth matte plastic coating gives a fair bit of grip. The built-in cable is light, flexible and cleverly titled upwards at the base of the mouse, all of which helps reduce any dragging sensation as you throw your hand around.\nThe OP1 8K uses mechanical switches, but the mouse is designed in a way that makes them (relatively) easy to swap out in a worst-case scenario. In general, the device\u2019s openness to customization is commendable \u2014 there are readily exposed screws on the bottom and a screwdriver, optional side grips and larger PTFE feet in the box.\nBy default, the main clicks are on the stiffer side but fast to actuate and noticeably crisp. You can actually set these switches to use a \u201cspeed mode\u201d that reduces click latency even further, but either way the buttons are easy to spam. The right mouse button on our unit does sound a little sharper than the left, but the difference isn\u2019t severe and you can pop in quieter switches on the cheap if you want a different noise profile. The notched scroll wheel and two side buttons are well-tensioned, too. The latter feel somewhat hollow, but they\u2019re hard to hit by accident.\nSensor performance is predictably excellent; we saw no accuracy or motion delay issues across a range of games. With its light weight, fast clicks and smooth stock skates, everything about it feels tailor-made for snapping around in esports-style games like Counter-Strike 2 that prioritize quick reactions. The mouse also supports polling rates up to 8,000Hz \u2014 that\u2019s still far from essential, but it\u2019s at least easier to turn on when there\u2019s no battery drain to worry about. We also like Endgame Gear\u2019s configuration software, which looks like something out of the Windows 95 era but is simple to grok and takes up next to no resources.\nAt $75 (or $85 at Amazon), the OP1 8K certainly isn\u2019t the cheapest wired mouse, but it\u2019s still a good way less than wireless high-performance models. The most pressing issue may be that it can fall out of stock from time to time, as Endgame Gear is a relatively small company out of Germany.\n- Fast to click and flick\n- Sturdy, ultralight design\n- Light and flexible cable\n- Hardware is customizable\n- A bit small for large hands\n- Side buttons feel somewhat hollow\n- Occasional stock issues\nConnectivity: Wired (USB-A) | Shape: Right-handed | Weight: 101 grams | Dimensions: 5.11 x 2.95 x 1.65 inches | Sensor: Razer Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensor | Switches: Razer Optical Mouse Switches Gen-2 | Maximum polling rate: 1,000Hz | Programmable buttons: 11 | Battery life (rated): N/A\nIt\u2019s a few years old, but the Razer Basilisk V3 remains our favorite wired gaming mouse with an ergonomic design. This one is more aggressively contoured than \u201cergo\u201d mice like the DeathAdder V3 Pro, with a large rubberized thumb rest, long main buttons and a rounded, moderately-sized hump running down its middle. It\u2019s fantastically comfy for palm grippers with medium- to large-sized hands, but it\u2019ll also play well with claw grips. Those who prefer a fingertip grip or just have smaller hands will likely find it too chunky, however.\nThe design as a whole feels robust; there\u2019s some minor flexing on the bottom-right side when you press down hard, but you\u2019d have to go out of your way to notice it. The matte plastic finish is pleasingly textured and sufficiently grippy. The cable is plenty flexible, while the PTFE feet glide smoothly. We also dig the fun-but-not-garish RGB lighting around the mouse\u2019s underside and scroll wheel. There are 11 customizable buttons in total, including two easy-to-reach side buttons and a dedicated \u201csensitivity clutch\u201d that lets you momentarily drop to a lower DPI for moments where you may need to aim more precisely. The latter will be particularly tough for the smaller-handed to reach comfortably, though.\nThe Basilisk V3 uses older optical switches than our other Razer top picks, but we haven\u2019t had any durability issues after a couple years of testing. While main clicks aren\u2019t nearly as fast as those on the Endgame Gear OP1 8K, they strike an agreeable balance between firmness and speed. They aren\u2019t all that loud, either. Similar to the Viper V3 Pro, the buttons are grooved in a way that naturally invites your index and middle fingers.\nThe scroll wheel might be the weakest element: It has clearly defined steps and an easily identifiable texture, but it\u2019s fairly loud and a bit wobbly. That said, it can tilt side-to-side \u2014 which helps explain the wobbliness \u2014 and there\u2019s a built-in toggle that lets you swap between a normal ratcheted scroll and a free-spin mode. That can be handy outside of games \u2014 say, when you need to scroll through a giant document or Excel sheet.\nRazer\u2019s Synapse software is still naggy with updates and Windows-only, but it makes customizing DPI levels, macros and RGB effects simple enough. You can save up to five different profiles to the mouse itself, though your lighting customizations won\u2019t carry over.\nWe haven\u2019t had any major issues with sensor accuracy, either, but at roughly 100 grams, the Basilisk V3 is obviously heftier than the ultralight mice we highlight above. While you absolutely can go off in Counter-Strike or Valorant with it, the mouse\u2019s weight and wide frame mean it\u2019s not expressly designed for games like those. It also can\u2019t go above a 1,000Hz polling rate. In many ways, this is the exact opposite of the OP1 8K, a device that feels designed from the ground up for competitive fare. Instead, the Basilisk V3 makes sense for righties who want a comfy and reliable mouse they can turn to for more casual gaming across genres. Razer sells it for $70, but since it\u2019s usually available for less than $50 at third-party retailers these days, you can consider it our pick for the best budget gaming mouse as well.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Razer has released a slightly refreshed model called the Basilisk V3 35K. That one comes with a technically improved sensor and newer optical switches, though the weight and overall shape are virtually identical. Given that we didn\u2019t have many issues with the tech inside of original V3, we\u2019d still recommend getting the older version while it\u2019s still in stock and available for less. If you see the 35K model on sale for a similar price, though, feel free to get that instead.\n- Super comfortable for medium to large hands\n- Well-built, with flexible cable\n- Versatile scroll wheel\n- Good value\n- Too heavy to be ideal for FPS games\n- Too bulky to be ideal for small hands\n- Scroll wheel is noisy\n- Naggy software\nConnectivity: Wired (USB-A) | Shape: Right-handed | Weight: 108 grams | Dimensions: 4.98 x 2.48 x 1.57 inches | Sensor: PixArt PMW3391 | Switches: Omron D2FC-F-K | Maximum polling rate: 1,000Hz | Programmable buttons: 17 | Battery life (rated): N/A\nIf you want a mouse specifically designed for MMO and MOBA games, get the Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite. It does the most important thing any MMO mouse can do, which is let you access several in-game actions with minimal effort. That\u2019s thanks to its 12 programmable side buttons, all of which deliver a comfortable, firm-but-not-stiff sensation when pressed. Two of the panel\u2019s four button rows are textured, which makes them easier to distinguish without having to look down. Uniquely, you can physically reposition this side panel with an Allen key included in the box, so if you find the buttons difficult to reach by default, you can address that. Either way, having a host of buttons right under your thumb makes it much easier to play MMOs like Final Fantasy XIV or even single-player RPGs like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, which ask you to navigate multiple \u201chotbars\u201d of commands at any given time.\nLike most MMO mice, the Scimitar RGB Elite is on the larger and heavier (108g) side, but it\u2019s not the bulkiest model we\u2019ve seen. Its shape should be accommodating to palm and claw grips, and most hand sizes. The middle has a rounded, not-overly-aggressive hump, while the bottom is more gently sloped than rivals like Razer\u2019s Naga lineup. The overall construction feels well-built, with a smooth matte finish, a grippy pinky rest and decent PTFE feet. Internally, its optical sensor (the Pixart PMW3391) isn\u2019t exactly advanced these days, but it\u2019s more than consistent enough for MMOs and MOBAs, which don\u2019t rely on precise, quick-twitch movements. It has no significant issues with latency, either.\nHowever, there are a few downsides. The braided cable feels durable but somewhat stiff. The scroll wheel is grippy and accurate enough, but it\u2019s a touch too recessed between the main buttons, and it could be firmer. Those main buttons never feel mushy, but they use mechanical switches, so they carry more of a long-term durability risk than optical alternatives. (Corsair rates them at 50 million clicks.) And Corsair\u2019s iCue software is, frankly, the worst: You can use it to customize key bindings, assign macros, adjust the (mild) RGB lighting and save profiles to the mouse, but figuring out how is wildly unintuitive.\nNevertheless, the MMO gaming mouse market doesn\u2019t really have one killer option these days. At a price that often hovers in the $60 to $75 range, the Scimitar RGB Elite offers better value than most. If you hate cables, Corsair sells a wireless version of the device too.\n- Cleverly textured side buttons make MMOs easier to navigate\n- Generally comfortable and well-built\n- Decent value relative to MMO mouse market\n- Stiff cable\n- Scroll wheel is too recessed\n- Annoying software\nConnectivity: Wireless, wired (USB-C) | Shape: Symmetrical | Weight: 35 grams (with included \"dot\" feet; 37 grams with standard feet) | Dimensions: 4.55 x 2.4 x 1.44 inches | Sensor: Pulsar XS-1 | Switches: Pulsar Optical Switch | Maximum polling rate: 8000Hz | Programmable buttons: 5 | Battery life (rated): No rating provided\nThe $130 Pulsar X2 CrazyLight is worth considering over the Viper V3 Pro and Hitscan Hyperlight if you\u2019re committed to a claw or fingertip grip and spend all your time playing twitchy shooter games. We\u2019re starting to wonder just how many prefixes for the word \u201clight\u201d these mouse companies can slap onto their products, but the CrazyLight\u2019s name is appropriate, as it weighs a mere 37 grams with its standard PTFE skates. It\u2019s another short symmetrical model, comparable to the Hitscan Hyperlight in overall footprint, but it has a flatter hump down the center. That means it won\u2019t really fill out medium-to-large hands with a palm grip. But it\u2019s comfortable for everything else, and its slight frame feels natural in games that demand snap reactions. You know how baseball players will sometimes swing a heavier bat when they\u2019re on deck to make their actual bat feel faster? This is sort of like the mouse equivalent of swinging that lighter bat.\nA reliable sensor and easy-gliding feet help, while the clicky optical switches are fast without feeling too sensitive. (Expect a sharper tone, though.) The scroll wheel is well-tuned and precise. There\u2019s no creaking or flexing despite the low weight, and it\u2019s all coated in a pleasing matte plastic. It also comes in a few fun colors. The two side buttons are somewhat thin, and Pulsar\u2019s software is a little clunky. This is also another one with an open bottom side, so it\u2019s more susceptible to dust than the Viper V3 Pro. Nevertheless, while the CrazyLight isn\u2019t quite as welcoming to all hands as Razer\u2019s mouse, it does what it sets out to do.\n- Incredibly lightweight design that's great for fingertip and claw grips\n- Excellent performance\n- Well-built\n- Holes in baseplate leave interior open to dust and debris\n- Not built for palm grips with larger hands\n- Side buttons aren't the best\n(Xlite V3 Medium) Connectivity: Wireless, wired (USB-C) | Shape: Symmetrical | Weight: 55 grams | Dimensions: 4.8 x 2.6 x 1.7 inches | Sensor: PixArt PAW3395 | Switches: Raesha Optical (90 M) | Maximum polling rate: 1,000Hz (4,000Hz with optional dongle) | Programmable buttons: 5 | Battery life (rated): Up to 100 hours at 1,000Hz\nThe Pulsar Xlite V3, meanwhile, is an excellent alternative to the DeathAdder V3 Pro if you want a right-handed design. It has a similar contoured shape, so it\u2019s great for palm and claw grips, but it\u2019s a pinch lighter. Notably, Pulsar sells mini, medium and large variants, so you can choose a size that fits your hands best. Each have rigid outer shells and snappy optical buttons, though the smooth plastic coating isn\u2019t as grippy as either of the DeathAdder\u2019s finishes and the side buttons aren\u2019t as crisp.\nLike the CrazyLight, the Xlite V3 also has cutouts across the bottom, making it more susceptible to gunk. Still, this is a light, comfortable and highly responsive ergo mouse. At its recent street price of $70 (pre-tariffs), it\u2019s a strong buy.\nWe\u2019ll note that Pulsar has a revised version of this mouse called the Xlite V4. We haven\u2019t tested it for ourselves but it\u2019s not a major refresh, primarily adding a newer sensor and 8K polling support (with an optional dongle) in the same shape. If the Xlite V3 goes out of stock, or if you see the two mice available for the same price, just grab the V4. But the V3 is the better value while it remains in stock at a discount.\n- Solid value\n- Well-suited for palm and claw grips\n- Available in different sizes\n- Holes in baseplate leave interior open to dust and debris\n- Coating could be grippier\nOther gaming mice we've tested\nNote: The following is a selection of especially noteworthy mice we've tested, not a comprehensive list of every single model we\u2019ve ever put through its paces.\nLamzu Maya X\nThe Lamzu Maya X is a great symmetrical mouse and a close competitor to the Razer Viper V3 Pro. It\u2019d be next in line for an honorable mention, as it has most of the things we like about the Hitscan Hyperlight and Pulsar X2 CrazyLight: a smooth matte finish, a sturdy frame, easy-gliding feet, accurate performance, a tight scroll wheel and a lightweight design (46g). It\u2019s close in size to the Viper V3 Pro, but it\u2019s cheaper at $120, plus it uses the superior Omron optical switches we praised for the Hyperlight above. Its configuration software is also entirely accessible over the web (for Chromium-based browsers at least), so you don\u2019t have to download anything extra to your PC.\nHowever, we think the Viper\u2019s longer frame and ever-so-slightly more concave sides keep it just a little comfier for larger hands and palm grips. Its side buttons are still more satisfying to press and its finish provides more grip. The Maya also follows the \u201cleave the entire bottom of your mouse exposed\u201d trend to reach its lower weight. And though the software being web-based is great, it is very much a Chinese Gaming App with grammatical errors and weird formatting quirks. The reality is that fine margins separate high-end gaming mice nowadays \u2014 the Maya X is good, but we prefer the Viper at this size, while the Hitscan and CrazyLight are better for smaller hands.\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2\nThe Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 is a close rival to the Razer Viper V3 Pro for those who want a no-frills, high-end wireless gaming mouse. It has a similar \u201cpotato\u201d-style shape, its tracking is similarly tremendous and its optical-mechanical switches have a distinct feel. Unlike the first Superlight, it also charges over USB-C. But the Viper\u2019s main clicks are crisper and more pleasant-sounding, its side buttons aren't as mushy and its scroll wheel is both firmer and grippier. It\u2019s also slightly lighter.\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX\nThe G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX is the ergonomic version of the Superlight 2, packing the same sensor and hybrid switches in a chunkier, right-handed shape. We found its right side to flare out a little too much, though, often leaving our pinky finger in a less-than-comfortable position. Those with medium-sized hands may find its center hump to be too aggressive for consistent aiming as well. The DeathAdder V3 Pro\u2019s main buttons are still more invitingly curved and consistent to press beyond that, while its coating isn\u2019t as slippery. The DEX\u2019s scroll wheel is tighter, and all of its internal tech is great, so by no means is this a poor choice. But at $180 after a tariff-related price hike, there are better values out there.\nRazer Viper V3 HyperSpeed\nMuch like the DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed, Razer\u2019s Viper V3 HyperSpeed is a lower-cost variant of the top-end Viper V3 Pro. (Confusing, we know.) At $70, it\u2019s a solid value. Its symmetrical shape and soft-touch finish are virtually identical to the more premium model, and though it technically has a worse sensor, the drop-off is hardly noticeable. The main trade-off is that it\u2019s heavier (about 82g), as it requires a AA battery for power. That doesn\u2019t make it outright hefty, but you can feel the difference in twitchier games. It uses older mechanical switches and smaller PTFE feet, too, plus it lacks a port for connecting a cable. So it\u2019s not as close to its big sibling as the mid-tier DeathAdder. Some may prefer that its DPI button is located on the top of the mouse, though, and its simpler on-off switch is nice.\nRazer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed\nThe Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is a more affordable wireless version of the Basilisk V3 with the same comfortable shape and layout, plus a quieter scroll wheel. Because it requires a AA battery for power, though, it weighs around 115g. That's not great for fast-paced games. The scroll wheel can\u2019t tilt left or right, either, nor can it switch between a ratcheted and free-spin mode. It also uses less durable mechanical switches and only supports one onboard profile. All that said, it\u2019s a decent value at $70.\nPulsar X2 V2\nThe $100 Pulsar X2 V2 is another decent option if you want a high-performing symmetrical mouse for less than the Viper V3 Pro. It\u2019s available in mini and standard sizes: The former is a technically weightier (51 grams) version of the X2 CrazyLight, while the latter is that but bigger. Both have sturdy plastic frames, though they\u2019re still meant for claw or fingertip grips first. They also have cutouts across their undersides. As with the Xlite V3, Pulsar now sells a newer model called the X2 V3, though that\u2019s a minor refresh with an updated sensor and 8K polling rate support. The latest model is worth getting instead when the X2 V2 isn\u2019t discounted, but we prefer the Hitscan Hyperlight and its more pleasing clicks to both in this price range.\nPwnage Stormbreaker\nThe Pwnage Stormbreaker is a superlight (51g), exceptionally sturdy and premium-feeling wireless mouse that\u2019s largely made from magnesium alloy instead of plastic. It performs about on par with our top picks, which is excellent, while its right-handed, medium-sized shape should suit palm and claw grippers well. (If you know BenQ\u2019s Zowie EC line, the shape is basically that.) However, the extensive cutouts all over the sides and top shell are noticeable in the hand and make the device more susceptible to debris buildup than the DeathAdder V3 Pro. While the buttons and scroll wheel are impressively tight, the main clicks are a bit too stiff and high-pitched for our liking. We also noticed more connection stutters than usual on our test PC, and it\u2019s expensive at $169.\nBenQ Zowie U2\nSpeaking of BenQ, its Zowie U2 is a perfectly decent alternative to the Viper V3 Pro that costs about $30 less. It tracks great, it\u2019s lightweight (60g) and its mechanical clicks feel fine. It also comes with two receivers, one of which doubles as a handy charging dock. It has a symmetrical shape with sides that curve inwards and a decently-sized hump at the back; BenQ says it\u2019s designed for claw grips, and it is indeed good for that, but it should also work for fingertip grippers with larger hands or palm grippers with smaller ones. Alas, the scroll wheel is gratingly loud and the plastic coating picks up smudges and hand oils like it\u2019s its job. There\u2019s also no configuration software, which can make adjusting settings a little cumbersome, though some may prefer not having to install any extra bloat on their PC. This mouse also maxes out at a 1,000Hz polling rate \u2014 that\u2019s not a big deal in practice, but it's technically behind many other mice in this price range.\nLogitech G309 Lightspeed\nThere isn\u2019t much wrong with the Logitech G309 Lightspeed in a vacuum. It\u2019s built like a tank, its sensor is accurate and its egg-like shape should feel OK, if not superlative, in most hand sizes and grip types. It uses the same hybrid switches as the G Pro X Superlight 2, so the clicks don\u2019t sound great but are fast. It also has a supercapacitor inside, which gives it effectively infinite battery life if you own Logitech\u2019s (costly) PowerPlay charging mat. That\u2019s neat! Most people, though, will need to pop in a AA battery, which pushes the weight up around 85 grams. As most of that weight is felt toward the back, the mouse can feel relatively clunky to fling around in FPS games. We\u2019re not fans of the ugly recess across the middle of the device, either, as it creates a space for dust to collect. At $90 after a recent price hike, the G309 is still OK for casual types who\u2019ll only buy from a name brand. But unless you use PowerPlay, it doesn\u2019t do much to stand out from other options around the same price.\nHyperX Pulsefire Haste 2\nThe HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 is a decent wired model for those who want a flatter ambidextrous shape. It performs well for competitive play, and it\u2019s plenty light (53g) thanks to a clever design with cutouts on the bottom that are covered by the mouse\u2019s label. But the Endgame Gear OP1 8K is better-built and more comfortable, so we think it\u2019s worth the extra cash. The Razer Viper 8KHz was another solid (albeit heavier) option with a similar shape, but that mouse has been discontinued.\nHyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Core Wireless\nThe HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Core Wireless is a budget-friendly wireless variant of the Haste 2. It may be OK if you must go wireless and only have $50 to spend, as its shell feels sturdy and its low-profile shape is well-suited to claw or fingertip grips. It\u2019s a little weightier than the wired Haste 2 (about 70g) since it runs on a AAA battery, but that\u2019s nowhere near heavy. That said, its main buttons feel somewhat mushy, and we observed a few sensor hiccups and inconsistencies, particularly when we had HyperX\u2019s Ngenuity software open.\nHyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro\nWe had persistent, debilitating connection issues with the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro on both Windows 11 and macOS over multiple days, so we can\u2019t recommend it.\nLogitech G502 X\nThe Logitech G502 X has a generally similar shape as the Razer Basilisk V3, with a lower weight (84g) and more side buttons. However, its main buttons are noisier, it\u2019s a slightly more awkward fit for most hands and its rubber cable isn\u2019t as flexible. It's also much more expensive after Logitech's recent round of price increases, plus it lacks RGB.\nLogitech G203 Lightsync\nThe Logitech G203 Lightsync is our former budget pick. It\u2019s often available in the $20 to $30 range these days, and at that price it\u2019s still fine if you want a competent gaming mouse for as little money as possible. You can feel the cost cutting in its rubbery cable and mushy scroll wheel, however, and its shape is a bit too small and flat for larger hands. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is a wireless model with more or less the same shape, but it requires a AA battery to work and thus weighs just over 100g. It, too, feels somewhat outdated in 2025.\nRazer Cobra\nThe Razer Cobra is another value-oriented wired mouse with a compact shape. It\u2019s much lighter (58g) than the Logitech G203, with a more flexible cable and optical switches instead of mechanical ones. It's usually priced between $35 and $40, though, so the G203 is typically cheaper. The Endgame Gear OP1 8K still feels higher-quality across the board, but if you have smaller hands, use a fingertip grip and want a symmetrical mouse on the cheap, go for it.\nAlienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse\nThe Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse tracks well, glides smoothly and weighs just under 60 grams without having any holes in its outer shell. It\u2019s shaped like a Logitech G Pro X Lightspeed 2 with wider sides, so it should be comfortable for palm or claw grippers with large or medium-sized hands. Its matte finish is a touch too slippery, however, and its main buttons aren\u2019t as consistent or satisfying to press as our top picks (despite using Omron optical switches). Clicking them toward the top is too soft, clicking them toward the back is too stiff. The back side button sounds hollow beyond that, and Alienware\u2019s configuration software chews up far too much memory. All of this is overpriced at $150.\nGlorious Model I 2 Wireless\nThere\u2019s a fair amount to like about the Glorious Model I 2 Wireless: an ergonomic shape that\u2019s reminiscent of the Basilisk V3/G502 X but lighter at 75g, four customizable side buttons, the ability to connect over a USB receiver or Bluetooth, a smooth scroll wheel and tasteful RGB lighting, all for $100. However, its honeycomb-style design and mechanical switches both raise concerns about its long-term durability.\nGlorious Model D 2 Wireless\nThe Glorious Model D 2 Wireless also has holes all over its shell yet doesn\u2019t perform or feel significantly better than other mice around the $100 mark. Other reviews say it has latency issues as well.\nGlorious Model D 2 Pro + Model O 2 Pro\nThe ergonomic Model D 2 Pro and symmetrical Model O 2 Pro aren\u2019t loaded with cutouts, meanwhile, but their main buttons are relatively loud and sticky-feeling.\nWhat to look for in a gaming mouse\nWired vs. wireless\nBuying a wireless gaming mouse used to mean sacrificing a certain level of responsiveness, but thankfully, that\u2019s no longer the case. Over the last few years, wireless connectivity has improved to the point where the difference in latency between a good wireless model and a tried-and-true wired gaming mouse is barely perceptible.\nNote, however, that we\u2019re strictly talking about mice that use a 2.4GHz connection (over a USB dongle), not Bluetooth. Many of the best wireless gaming mouse models support both connection options, which is great for travel, but Bluetooth\u2019s latency is generally too high to be reliable for gaming.\nGoing wireless still has other trade-offs, too. Battery life is improving all the time, but with their higher performance demands and RGB lighting, most wireless gaming mice usually don't last as long as \"normal\" wireless models. You shouldn\u2019t expect more than a few days of power from a rechargeable gaming mouse you use regularly. Some gaming mice offer wireless charging too, which makes things easier. Good wireless gaming mice usually come at a much higher cost than their wired counterparts as well.\nThat\u2019s not to say the premium is never worth it: Who wants yet another cable on their desk? You may need a wireless model if you hate the feel of \u201ccable drag\u201d or if your gaming PC is located in an awkward spot. Many wireless gaming mice come with a cable you can hook up in a pinch as well. But if price is your primary concern, a good wired mouse may be a better value.\nComfort and grip types\nEveryone\u2019s hands are different, so at the end of the day, calling one mouse \u201cmore comfortable\u201d than another is mostly subjective. Ensuring your comfort is the most essential step when buying any mouse, though, so we\u2019ve done our best to consider how each device we tested works with smaller, average-sized and larger hands alike.\nWe also considered how each peripheral accommodates the three grip styles most people use while holding a mouse: palm, fingertip and claw. As a refresher, a palm grip is when your whole hand rests on the mouse, with your fingers resting flat on the main buttons. A fingertip grip is when you steer the mouse solely with the tips of your fingers, with your palm not in contact with the device at all. A claw grip is when your palm only touches the back edge of the mouse, with your fingers arched in a claw-like shape toward the buttons.\nIn general, most people use a palm grip, which tends to offer the greatest sense of control \u2014 though, depending on the size of your hand, you may need your mouse to be a specific length to use it comfortably. A fingertip grip can allow for more rapid movements, while a claw grip is something of a balance between the two. Switch and Click has a good breakdown if you\u2019d like more detail, but we\u2019ve noted above if a mouse isn\u2019t well-suited for a particular grip style. For what it\u2019s worth, yours truly is a claw gripper most of the time.\nBuild quality and design\nA good gaming mouse feels sturdy and won\u2019t flex or creak when used strenuously. We valued mice without any overly sharp angles or grooves that could be awkward for most people to hold. And while most gaming mice have plastic exteriors, not all plastic is created equal, so we looked for finishes that were smooth, not too slick and capable of withstanding the sweaty palms that often come with competitive gaming sessions.\nThe gaming mouse market is mostly split between two design styles: ergonomic and ambidextrous. Ergonomic mice are almost always made with right-handed users in mind and often feature dedicated thumb rests. Ambidextrous mice are more symmetrical and designed to be used with either hand (though they may not have extra buttons on both sides). Whether an ergonomic or ambidextrous gaming mouse works best for you is largely a matter of personal preference.\nA gaming mouse\u2019s feet, meanwhile, should provide a consistent glide and reduce the friction between your mouse and mouse pad beneath it as much as possible. For the best performance, look for feet made from PTFE (aka Teflon). All feet will eventually wear down, but many mice come with spares, and most manufacturers sell replacements if needed.\nAs for flashy RGB lighting, it\u2019s a nice bonus, but little more than that. Still, if you\u2019ve already kitted out your setup with RGB, having a mouse with adjustable lighting effects can add to the gaming experience (and more consumer tech could stand to do things for pleasure\u2019s sake). More practically, some mice let you assign custom lighting settings to separate profiles, which can make it easier to see which one you\u2019re currently using.\nWeight\nGaming mice have gotten lighter and lighter over the years, with some recent releases weighing less than 30 grams. Your mouse doesn\u2019t need to be that feathery \u2014 anything under 80g is still reasonably light, and it\u2019s not like a 100g mouse feels like a total anchor. Regardless, a lightweight mouse makes it easier to pull off fast movements repeatedly, with less inertia. That said, some players still enjoy a little bit of bulk in their gaming mouse (relatively speaking), especially with games that aren\u2019t as reliant on twitchy reactions.\nTo reach those lightest weights, some manufacturers have released gaming mice with \u201choneycomb\u201d-style designs, which feature an array of cutouts in the outer shell. These mice can still perform great, but having a bunch of holes that expose the internal circuit board to possible sweat, dust and detritus isn\u2019t the best for long-term durability. If a mouse must have cutouts, it's better if they're relegated to the bottom of the design, where debris is less likely to enter the frame.\nSwitches, buttons and scroll wheel\nA growing number of gaming mice use optical switches instead of mechanical ones. Since these involve fewer bits making physical contact, they should generally be more durable and less prone to unwanted \u201cdouble-clicks\u201d over time. Many gamers still find good mechanical switches more satisfying to press, so it's not like you should avoid mechanical mice altogether. They just carry a little more long-term risk in a vacuum.\nSince most people will use their gaming mouse as their mouse-mouse, you may want main buttons that have a softer feel when pressed, with enough travel to make inadvertent actuations less frequent. But even that is a matter of preference: You may want lighter buttons if you play games that call for constant clicking. We also looked to testing from sites like Rtings to ensure each mouse we recommend has a sufficiently low click latency, meaning your clicks will register with minimal lag.\nBeyond the standard click panels, a good gaming mouse should also have programmable buttons for quick macros or shortcuts. For most games, shoot for at least two extra buttons on the thumb-side panel that are easy to reach and difficult to press by accident. Many mice have more buttons, which can be a plus, but not if they force you to contort your fingers to avoid hitting them. For MMO mice, having at least 12 side buttons is preferable in order to access as many hotbar commands as possible.\nAs for the scroll wheel, it should have distinct, ratcheted \u201csteps\u201d that aren\u2019t too resistant but make it clear when you\u2019ve actually scrolled. Its texture should be grippy, and it shouldn't make a distracting amount of noise when used. The wheel should also be clickable, giving you another input to customize for certain games (e.g., to control the zoom on a sniper rifle).\nSensors and performance\nSome are more proficient than others, but generally speaking, the optical sensors built into most modern gaming mice are more than fast and accurate enough for most people\u2019s needs.\nWhile shopping for gaming mice, you\u2019ll see a number of terms related to sensor performance. To be clear, a gaming mouse\u2019s responsiveness doesn\u2019t come down to just one spec. But for clarity\u2019s sake, here\u2019s a rundown of the more noteworthy jargon:\nDPI, or dots per inch, is a measure of a mouse\u2019s sensitivity. The higher the DPI setting, the more your cursor will move with every inch you move the mouse itself. Many gaming mice advertise extremely high DPIs that top out above 30,000, but that\u2019s largely marketing fluff: Few people play above 3,000, with 800 a common sweet spot. This concept is also referred to as CPI (counts per inch), which is probably the more accurate term, though DPI is used more often.\nIPS, or inches per second, refers to the maximum velocity a mouse sensor supports. The higher the IPS, the faster you can move the mouse before it becomes incapable of tracking motions correctly.\nAcceleration goes with IPS. In this context, it refers to how many Gs a mouse can withstand before it starts to track inaccurately.\nPolling rate is a measure of how often a mouse tells a computer where it is. In general, the more frequently your mouse reports information to your PC, the more predictable its response time should be. Anything at 500Hz or above is fine for casual gaming. The sweet spot for most is 1,000Hz. Many newer mice can go all the way up to 8,000Hz, but you start to see diminishing returns the higher you go unless own a powerful PC and play on a gaming monitor with an especially high refresh rate. Even then, a super-high polling rate is far from essential. Not all games are built with it in mind, plus it leads to much faster battery drain.\nLift-off distance is the height at which a mouse\u2019s sensor stops tracking the surface below it. Many competitive players like this to be as low as possible in order to avoid unintended cursor movements while repositioning their mouse.\nSoftware and onboard memory\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to find horror stories about bugs and other niggling issues caused by gaming mouse software, so the ideal app is one that doesn\u2019t force you to use it all the time. It should let you adjust as many of the aspects above as possible, ideally to several distinct profiles. Preferably, you can save your settings directly to the mouse itself, letting you pick your customizations back up on another device without having to redownload any software. All this is most important on Windows, but Mac compatibility is always good to have.\nWarranty and customer support\nMost major gaming mice brands offer warranties between one and three years. The longer and more extensive a manufacturer\u2019s program is, the better. This is the case with most consumer tech, but we note it here because the gaming mouse market is particularly flush with products from less-than-household names, many of which you may see hyped up on YouTube, Reddit or elsewhere around the web. A bunch of these more obscure mice are genuinely great, but if you ever buy from a more niche brand, it\u2019s worth checking that some level of customer support is in place. We\u2019ve made sure our picks for the best gaming mice aren\u2019t riddled with an abnormal amount of poor user reviews.\nRecent updates\nJune 2025: We\u2019ve added a couple new alternate picks in the Hitscan Hyperlight and Pulsar X2 CrazyLight. We\u2019ve removed the Lamzu Atlantis OG V2 4K as an honorable mention as a result, along with a couple other mice that no longer appear to be available. All other details should be up-to-date. The gaming mouse market remains an extremely busy one, so it\u2019s difficult for us to review everything. That said, we\u2019re currently testing a few other recent releases from Corsair and ASUS, and we\u2019re keeping an eye out for potential updates to a couple of our picks from Razer and Endgame Gear.\nNovember 2024: We\u2019ve updated this guide with testing notes on the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX. We\u2019ve also added mentions of the Razer Basilisk V3 35K and Pulsar Xlite V4, two recently released updates to a couple of our current picks. We aim to test those more fully, alongside a few others, for our next update.\nSeptember 2024: We've completely refreshed this guide for late 2024, adding new main picks based on shape alongside notes on several other gaming mice we've tested in recent months. We're now in the process of testing Logitech's new G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX, a flagship ergonomic mouse that the company announced right as we were putting the finishing touches on this update."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best ergonomic keyboards for 2025\nFully split, Alice, mechanical, ortholinear keyboards \u2014 we tested them all.\nIf you spend a good portion of your waking hours behind a desk, simply slapping an ergonomic mouse and keyboard on your desk won\u2019t solve the real problem, which is sitting still for too long. But after you\u2019ve peppered in a few walks and added some stretches for good measure, your workstation ergonomics is the next thing to consider. Hunching, twisting and contorting are all likely to lead to discomfort in the long run.\nErgonomic keyboards can help: these boards split, tilt and/or angle the keys in ways that help keep your shoulders and chest more open and your forearms and wrists more aligned. One ergonomic board won\u2019t work for everyone, so I tested out 15 different models. I tried models with a mix of ergonomic features that include fully split and unibody split or Alice designs, as well as columnar orientations, thumb clusters, programmable keys and more. I also shared what I\u2019ve learned about the benefits of various designs so you can find the best ergonomic keyboard for you.\nTable of contents\nBest ergonomic keyboards for 2025\nErgonomic features: Alice split, center tenting, optional negative tilt, wrist rest | Host connection: Bluetooth or USB receiver | Switch type: Scissor | Hotkey compatibility: Mac and Windows | Ten key: Yes | RGB lighting: No | Programing interface: Logi Options+ (app) | Language/Layout: QWERTY\nThe Ergo K860 from Logitech closely resembles standard, full-size keyboard designs, so there\u2019s not much of a learning curve. But subtle changes like the Alice layout, tented middle and optional negative tilt make typing noticeably more ergonomic. Logitech makes some of our favorite PC accessories, and the reasons why are all evident with this keyboard: it connects quickly and reliably via Bluetooth, the build is solid and feels high-quality and it's reasonably priced at $130 (and is often on sale for around $100).\nIt\u2019s compatible with more recent iterations of Windows, MacOS, iPadOS, ChromeOS and Linux, though you\u2019ll need software to support non-basic key functions for the latter two operating systems. There are three switching buttons that swap between previously connected devices, and the board speedily swapped between a MacBook and a PC laptop in my tests. Built-in function keys like volume and brightness worked well and the Option/Start and Command/Alt combo keys worked correctly depending on which computer was connected to.\nThe rotated Alice-split design and raised center made a difference in the way I held my arms as I typed, allowing me to keep my elbows comfortably away from my ribs and my palms rotated inward instead of forcing them flat. The palm rest is springy but firm (albeit not removable) and the arrow keys and a numeric keypad on the right side put all possible keys within reach. Unfortunately, that adds length to that side of the board, which forces your mouse farther out. The scissor switch keys can feel mushy if you\u2019re coming from a mechanical board, but they\u2019re responsive enough. Logitech offers software for programming the keys, but this model will likely appeal most to those looking for a plug and play option.\nFor a mechanical Alice keyboard with both wireless and wired capabilities, I recommend the Periboard 835. The Mac and Windows-compatible board has a solid build, low profile switches, RGB lighting, comfortable tenting and a few extra programmable keys.\n- Rotated keys and palm rest make typing comfortable\n- Wirelessly connects quickly to three devices\n- Hotkeys work with MacOS and Windows\n- Takes up a large footprint\n- Wrist rest is not removable\nErgonomic features: Alice split, center tenting, optional negative tilt, wrist rest | Host connection: Bluetooth or USB-C | Switch type: Mechanical Gateron low-profile Brown | Hotkey compatibility: Mac or Windows (two models) | Ten key: Yes (with layers) | RGB lighting: No, just backlighting | Programing interface: Kinesis Clique (browser) | Language/Layout: QWERTY (programmable)\nThe unibody, Alice-split mWave from Kinesis has a lot in common with the Logitech Ergo K860 \u2014 a built-in wrist rest, center tenting and swappable Bluetooth connections. But the mechanical keys, tenkeyless design and programmable layers may make the mWave a better option for some. And, at $120, it\u2019s also about $20 cheaper.\nThe tented, Alice-split design puts my hands into a relaxed position and allows for a comfortable amount of space between each elbow. The wrist pad is smooth and firm, with just a bit of give so it doesn\u2019t put too much pressure on my wrists. That nearly makes up for the fact that the pad is not removable. You also get three magnetic feet to create an optional negative tilt \u2014 in case you prefer typing with your hands angled downward.\nUnlike the Ergo K860, the mWave is tenkeyless, which lets you keep your mouse closer (if you\u2019re right-handed). But because the layers function turns some of the letter keys into a number pad, you don\u2019t lose out on quicker data entry.\nIn fact, all keys are programmable using Kenisis\u2019 browser-based Clique software. It\u2019s not the simplest programming software I\u2019ve used, but it\u2019s easy enough to figure out. As for programmable keys, there aren\u2019t a ton of extra or blank keys for you to mod (I ended up replacing the caps lock key with a clipboard shortcut), but the software lets you create multiple layers, which should cover any shortcuts and macros you need to be productive.\nBut the mWave should also appeal to people who just want a plug-and-play option. It comes in two models, a white board with macOS function keys, like media playback, Mission Control and Spotlight Search, as well as a PC version with keycaps for the Windows key and alt button. Both boards will work with either macOS or Windows (as well as Chrome, Linux, Android and iOS) and if you want a black board for use with a Mac, you can buy a set of Apple-themed keycaps, or a white set for use with a PC.\nMy only real complaint with the board is the sound. My son, who is eight, played with the board and noted, \u201cThese keys are not buttery at all. Very clacky.\u201d (Apparently I\u2019ve talked keyboards in front of him a fair deal.) And he\u2019s right. The low-profile mechanical switches are properly springy and responsive but produce a loud, hollow clunk as you type. Nothing a good pair of headphones won\u2019t fix, but if you\u2019ve got sensitive workmates, you might start to annoy them with your woodblock racket.\nIt also comes with an USB-C to A cable, which is a little pointless, particularly for Mac users. The board has a Type C port \u2014 and a wired connection is required for programming \u2014 but MacBooks haven\u2019t had Type A connections for a long time. I simply used a USB-C to C data cable I had on hand, but it would be nice to be supplied with exactly what the setup requires.\nThe Kinesis rep confirmed the mWave was designed as a replacement for the now-discontinued Microsoft Sculpt \u2014 but with a few upgrades like mechanical keys, no dongle, and programmability. So if you miss that ergonomic classic, this may fill that void.\n- Springy mechanical key switches\n- Plug and play versions for Mac or PC\n- Tenkeyless design is more compact, but layers offer an integrated keypad\n- Fully programmable\n- Wrist rest not removable\n- Loud and clacky keys\nErgonomic features: Fully split | Host connection: USB-C port | Switch type: Mechanical (tactile or linear) | Hotkey compatibility: Mac and Windows | Ten key: No | RGB lighting: Yes | Programing interface: QMK/VIA (browser) | Language/Layout: QWERTY\nIf you (expertly) sawed a mechanical keyboard in two, it would look like the Keychron Q11. You can even push the two halves back together to make it look like a standard, 75 percent mechanical board (though once you discover the expediency of a snack bowl between the halves, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d do that).\nKeychron is widely respected in the mechanical keyboard world because they make keyboards with an impressive build quality that aren\u2019t astronomically expensive. Like all Keychron devices, you can buy this one assembled or barebones, to which you can add your own keycaps and switches. I tested a fully assembled model with Gateron G Pro Red linear mechanical switches, which provide smoother action and a quieter clack than tactile or clicky switches. The keycaps are made from PBT, a higher-quality polymer than the ABS plastic keys found in less expensive keyboards. The machined aluminum body feels substantial and there\u2019s no wobble. All of that combined creates a luxe and durable feel and a satisfying, buttery clack as you type.\nThe assembled version comes with keycaps (and a keycap puller) to set up the board for either Mac or Windows. A switch at the top of the board toggles between the two operating systems, ensuring the function keys act appropriately. Extra keys include the two customizable knobs at the top corners and five macro keys to the left of the board. Those and the rest of the board can be programmed with open source keyboard firmware QMK and VIA, which most Keychron boards are compatible with out of the box.\nI have very basic keyboard needs so I used VIA to give the right knob zoom capabilities, make the M1 key open a clipboard manager and have the M2 key execute a screenshot. Programming with VIA requires the use of keycodes and you\u2019ll need to define macros within the app to get the knob to do more advanced things beyond the pre-selected options, but the implementation of your new instructions is instantaneous (and quite satisfying).\nThe only drawbacks are the lack of tenting and the rather short USB-C bridge cable connecting the two sides. I found I wanted a little more separation than nine inches, so I swapped it for a longer cord. But there\u2019s no easy fix for the lack of center lift.\n- High quality build\n- Smooth and buttery mechanical keys\n- Fully split keys keep your hands at a comfortable distance apart\n- Easily toggle between Mac and Windows systems\n- No center tenting\n- Short bridge cable included\nErgonomic features: Alice split, center tenting, optional negative tilt, wrist rest | Host connection: Bluetooth or USB receiver | Switch type: Membrane | Hotkey compatibility: Windows | Ten key: No | RGB lighting: No | Programing interface: Kensington Konnect | Language/layout: QWERTY\nThe compact Kensington Pro Fit Ergo sells for $70 at full price, but is often on sale for around $55. That makes it a good budget board, but it feels much more premium than the price tag suggests. The membrane keys are surprisingly springy and the low profile keycaps make typing easy. The wrist rest, especially when combined with the negative tilt, hits my palms at just the right spot, not putting pressure on my tendons while keeping the backs of my wrists straight. Of course, different hand sizes will have different experiences, but my men\u2019s medium/women\u2019s large mitts were comfortable.\nIt connected easily via Bluetooth or radio dongle to both the Mac and PC I tried, staying reliably connected and woke quickly from sleep. And the LED indicator for the rechargeable battery stayed green (full) over the month or so of testing in which I used it and stored it intermittently. Recharging is simple via the USB port. While it\u2019s simple to switch to a Mac or Windows layout, the keyboard works better as a PC peripheral.\nKensington\u2019s software allows you to reprogram the function keys and a few specialty keys with shortcuts or macros but I couldn\u2019t get the software to work with my Mac. It performed fine with my PC laptop, but this probably isn't the keyboard to get if you want minute, customized key remapping anyway. If you just want a relatively inexpensive keyboard that\u2019s far more comfortable to type on than most, this is a good one to grab.\nErgonomic features: Fully split, center tenting, thumb cluster | Host connection: USB-C port | Switch type: Mechanical (tactile, clicky, linear) | Hotkey compatibility: Mac and Windows | Ten key: No | RGB lighting: Yes | Programing interface: Oryx (browser) | Language/Layout: QWERTY (programmable)\nA rep I spoke with at ZSA warned me about the Voyager, saying the board has an effect \u201clike a brain injury: A moment ago you knew how to type, and now you don't.\u201d That\u2019s exactly how I felt after plugging in the impossibly compact accessory. For one, the columnar layout puts keys (particularly those on the bottom row) in spots you don\u2019t intuitively reach for. Then there\u2019s a thumb cluster where you\u2019ll find not just the space bar, but other important keys like return. Finally, the board uses layers, giving each key up to three functions.\nI actually had to interrupt testing at one point and plug in another keyboard because I just felt too slow and disconnected like I was a typist with oven mitts on. However, now that I have the hang of how the Voyager works, it feels magical. Rarely do my hands need to leave the home position, yet every key I need on a regular basis is easily accessible.\nSince you don\u2019t need to reorient your fingers when you use arrow keys, hit the mute button or type with the number pad, you\u2019re always in the same position, which can save you some serious accumulated time. Your thumbs, which are fairly dexterous, are capable of doing more than just mashing the spacebar; here, they operate the return key, tab button and can even initialize layers. The fully split and extra compact design let you position the two boards anywhere they feel comfortable and the optional magnetic legs give it a subtle but effective center tenting.\nWhere some keyboards offer remapping capabilities as a nice-to-have feature, the majority of people will likely want to use either the browser-based Oryx configurator or Zsa's Keymapp app to switch up what these keys do. It took me multiple tries to get them set in a way that worked for me, so I got pretty familiar with Oryx. It doesn\u2019t require you to lookup keycodes, instead giving you a vast library of searchable commands. But changes aren\u2019t implemented automatically \u2014 you have to flash the keyboard's firmware by pushing a button at the top edge of the device to make the changes.\nCertain system-specific functions, like the Mission Control key on a Mac, need to be programmed using key sequences (in this case, control + down arrow). And occasionally the board will mistake a single tap for a tap and hold (which often enables a second function). I also flashed the board once and lost all use of the right side, but reflashing fixed it.\nThe Voyager is not for someone looking for a quick adjustment to improve their ergonomics. It\u2019ll take weeks of practice and reprogramming (both the board and your brain) before typing feels fluid again. I recommend keeping a screenshot of your latest Oryx-configured layout on your desktop for reference until you remember which keys do what. That said, once things start clicking, the Voyager really does maximize your output while minimizing your movements.\nIf you want something fully split with thumb clusters and a columnar layout but that\u2019s a little less minimal \u2014 and wireless to boot \u2014 the Advantage 360 from Kinesis, makers of the popular Advantage 2 is a good one to check out. It looks like it comes from an \u201880s-era IBM office but is somehow also from the future. The tenting goes from low to intense and the keys curve concavely to meet your fingers where they naturally land. The 360 is per-key programmable, works with layers and has four macros keys.\n- Fully split board\n- Center tenting for a natural hand position\n- Thumb cluster lets your thumb do more work\n- Compact size and clever key mapping keep your hands in the home position\n- Difficult to relearn ortholinear layout\n- Takes time to program and learn the right key functions\nErgonomic features: Fully split, columnar keys, thumb cluster, wrist rest, optional tenting and negative tilt (additional cost) | Host connection: Wired or Bluetooth and USB receiver (wireless costs extra) | Switch type: Mechanical (tactile, linear or clicky) | Hotkey compatibility: Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS & Android | Ten key: Programmable | RGB lighting: Yes | Programing interface: Bazecor | Language/layout: QWERTY (but programmable to any layout)\nLike the Zsa Voyager, The Dygma Defy is another fully split, columnar board with thumb clusters and keys and layers that are per-key programmable. It has a little more going on than the Voyager, with full sized keycaps, built-in wrist rests and twenty more keys, including eight keys in each thumb cluster.\nA recent firmware update for the Dygma Defy includes rewritten wireless communications and more configuration options within the programming software, Bazecor. Using it to map the keys is super simple to figure out, making it easy to program shortcuts, macros and layers (again, sticking a screenshot of your keys layout on your desktop will help as you learn what you\u2019ve programmed each key to do). The keys are a delight to type on with springy and responsive mechanical switches. As a whole, the Defy feels well designed and the (detachable) wrist rests have a just-right consistency.\nOptionally, you can add an LED underglow, tenting mechanisms and wireless capabilities (Bluetooth and RF) but each add-on increases the price by $70, $80 and $90, respectively. That brought the fully kitted-out version I tested to $609. Without those, it\u2019ll run you $369. That\u2019s very close in price to the Voyager, which doesn\u2019t have an underglow or wireless capabilities. The Voyager does include tenting knobs, but the lift is minimal at about a half an inch. At its maximum setting, the Defy\u2019s tenting brings the halves nearly vertical.\nThe Defy is a well-made, deluxe board, especially with the add-ons. It\u2019s probably best for those who prefer a maximalist working setup and need lots of extra options for programmable keys. I found myself at a loss for what to do with all the keys and had a tough time keeping them all straight. Plus my cluttered desk felt like it was sacrificing a bit too much room to accommodate the two sizable halves. For me, the Voyager strikes a better balance between offering extra keys and taking up minimal desk real estate.\n- Premium build\n- 16 thumb cluster keys\n- Programming software is easy to use\n- Expensive, especially with optional features\n- High learning curve\nErgonomic features: Fully split, center tenting, removable wrist rest | Host connection: USB-A cable | Switch type: Mechanical (tactile, clicky, linear) | Hotkey compatibility: Mac and Windows | Ten key: No | RGB lighting: Yes | Programing interface: SmartSet (app) | Language/Layout: QWERTY\nAs I said in our guide to ergonomic mice, my sporadic, console-only gaming does not make me a gamer. But I have a decent understanding of what gamers might like. PC gamers who rely on the WASD keys may appreciate not having to contend with the right side of a keyboard at all, and instead use that space for their mouse. The Kinesis Freestyle Edge is a gaming variation on the brand's original Freestyle 2 is a fully split model with Cherry MX mechanical switches. The tactile Brown ones in my tester unit had a satisfying click and a not overly loud clacky noise. The wrist rests are removable and clever folding legs give you three height options for tenting and can also be removed completely.\nIt is backlit, with per-key RGB lights and nine macros buttons that can be programmed with the configuration app or without it using keyboard commands. All of this may appeal if you're looking for a programmable gaming keyboard with a few ergonomic tricks. Just keep in mind that all of those features add up to a somewhat bulky peripheral.\n- Fully split means you can just use the left half\n- High degree of optional tenting\n- Additional programmable shortcut keys\n- Somewhat bulky\n- Built-in cables are not customizable\nWhat to look for in an ergonomic keyboard\nAlice vs split\nMost ergonomic keyboard layouts fall into two categories: unibody (or Alice) and split. The former is a single board with the two halves of the keys rotated about 30 degrees apart at the bottom. The separation forms an A-shaped space between the keys \u2014 which has nothing to do with why it\u2019s called an Alice layout, it\u2019s just a happy coincidence. This subtle tweak pushes your elbows away from your ribs while keeping a straight line from your forearm to your middle knuckle. Using one, I pretty instantly felt more open along the front side of my body. This layout more closely resembles a traditional keyboard, so it should be easier for most folks to get used to than a fully split option.\nSpeaking of, split boards break the keys into two separate parts you can position individually. You can put them shoulder distance apart, bring them closer together or angle them as much as feels comfortable. You can also put your mouse between the halves, which may feel like an easier trip for your cursor hand and could potentially help with conditions like repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Personally, I like being able to put my current snack between the two parts. I've also found that pairing a split keyboard with a good ergonomic mouse has helped me even more, particularly a vertical mouse.\nTenkeyless\nYou can find ergonomic keyboards with and without number pads. Not having those number keys on the right hand side lets you keep your mouse closer in, minimizing overall reach. But if you work with numbers a lot, you\u2019ll likely want that pad included. Some programmable boards allow for the use of layers, which temporarily repurpose keys and can provide you with a ten-key option through clever remapping of letter keys.\nTenting and negative tilt\nTenting raises the middle of the keyboard up, so your hands move closer to a \u201chandshake\u201d position. Alice keyboards usually angle up towards the middle and always to a fixed degree, since the two sides are connected. Split boards often let you adjust the degree of tenting, going from flat to subtle to extreme lift.\nYou may have encountered keyboards with an optional lift at the back of the board, raising the top keys higher than the space bar. Every set of hands is different, but for most people, pulling the backs of the hands towards the forearms increases strain. Negative tilt has the opposite effect by sloping in the other direction, lowering the top number keys while raising the edge with the spacebar. Many Alice and some split keyboards offer an optional negative tilt. I found it was more comfortable to enable that feature when I\u2019m standing, and I preferred to have the keys flat when sat at my desk.\nStaggered vs columnar\nThis decision seems to be one of the more hotly-contested among ergo enthusiasts. A conventional keyboard has staggered keys, with each row slightly offset to the rows above and below it \u2014 so the A key is about halfway between the Q and W above it. This is a holdover from vintage mechanical typewriters, in which each press activated a hammer that smashed ink onto paper in the shape of a letter. To fit the hammers as close together as possible, while still allowing for finger pads, the keys were staggered.\nColumnar or ortholinear keyboards stack the keys in orderly columns, often with rows that are not linear. Proponents claim this makes the keys easier to reach. Whether that\u2019s true will be up to your fingers to decide, but I can say for certain that if you learned to type on a staggered keyboard, switching to a columnar layout is tough. It will take days, possibly weeks before you instinctively hit the C key. The N, M and B keys don\u2019t fare much better.\nProgrammable keys\nWith a few exceptions, most ergonomic keyboards will work with PCs or Macs as a standard typing input, but the use of function and hot keys may require some remapping. It can be as easy as an onboard switch to toggle between Mac and PC layouts, or as involved as downloading software to change up the keys. Some boards even include (or let you buy) extra keycaps to change, say, the Mac\u2019s Command and Option keys to PC\u2019s Start and Alt buttons. Those are what's called hot-swappable keys, meaning you just pull the old key off (usually with a provided key puller) and stick the new one on, no soldering required.\nFor some boards, remapping or programming keys using software is a crucial feature. Gaming peripherals have extra keys that you can set to execute a series of keystrokes with the push of a single button, and we cover the best gaming keyboards in a separate guide. Keyboards that work with layers, in which a single button can perform several functions, typically allow you to change what those are. Some ergo keyboards have non-standard layouts, like thumb clusters with multiple keys near the space bar that you operate with your thumb. You\u2019ll also be able to program those.\nOther considerations\nErgonomic keyboards come in mechanical, membrane, and scissor switch versions. Which works best for you is, again, up to your preference. I won\u2019t get too deep into the particulars here, as we have an entire guide devoted to the best mechanical boards, but the short of it is that membrane and scissor switches are less customizable than mechanical and typically cheaper. Typing on them tends to be quieter and softer. Mechanical switches are more customizable, offer a more responsive typing experience and are usually pricier.\nYou\u2019ll also have the option of wired or wireless ergonomic boards. All other things being equal, wired models are less expensive. Competitive gamers who rely on split-second responses may prefer the zero-lag of wired keyboards. Wired models also never run out of battery life and have fewer connectivity issues. But wireless keyboards keep your desk less cluttered.\nSome ergonomic keyboards come with permanent or removable wrist or palm rests, which can be cushioned or hard. This is another area where opinions diverge: proponents claim they help you maintain a neutral hand position, while detractors say they put pressure on the tendons in your wrist and can exacerbate conditions like carpal tunnel. Ideally, your palms should be resting, not your wrists, and you might find you like having that support or you may find the pressure uncomfortable.\nHow we tested ergonomic keyboards\nAll our guides begin with extensive research to figure out what\u2019s out there and what\u2019s worth testing. We consider brands with good reputations that we\u2019ve heard good things about from colleagues and look at keyboard reviews in forums and other trusted publications. For this guide, I looked for keyboards with ergonomic features like tenting, split keys, palm support and so on. I also zeroed in on boards that didn\u2019t require a deep amount of familiarity with the vast and exhaustive world of custom keyboards.\nOnce I settled on ten boards, I acquired them and used each one for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. I tried out the remapping and macros software and considered the comfort, design, price and durability of each model before arriving at picks I think will work best for the most people out there. For subsequent updates to this guide, I have continued to acquire and test out new keyboards as they come on the market, adding and replacing the top picks as warranted. If and when Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, like the Sculpt, come back on the market, as a collaboration with Incase has promised, I'll try those models, too.\nOther ergonomic keyboards we tested\nNaya Create\nI didn\u2019t get to fully test the Naya Create keyboard, but I was able to try one out for a few minutes during CES this year. It\u2019s one of the more customizable keyboards you\u2019ll find. Not only is it a fully split, mechanical board with programmable keys, the thumb clusters sit just below two modular platforms that each accept a touchpad, trackball, dial or a 3D joystick. These are meant to replace your mouse and other input devices, eliminating travel for your cursor hand. Each half of the keyboard body bends in two places to allow for precise tenting and, from my short time with the Naya, the hinges and the entire board felt solidly built. The Naya Create starts at $500 before you add on any of the mouse modules, but that\u2019s not stopping people from ordering. According to Naya\u2019s website, the first three batches of pre-orders sold out and the fourth batch will ship in July 2025.\nGoldtouch Elite Adjustable\nI remember wondering if something like the Goldtouch Elite Adjustable existed when I first started testing ergonomic keyboards. It didn\u2019t at the time, as far as I could tell, but now a connected yet adjustable split board is indeed a product you can buy. It\u2019s a solidly-built board and the ball joint connecting the two halves feels like it will put up with a lot of use. A squeeze of the lever at the top of the keys lets you set the board just how you like, adjusting both the vertical tenting and the angle between the two halves. There\u2019s no programming to speak of, just the ability to swap a few function keys like print screen and home.\nUnfortunately, the tenting doesn\u2019t work for me. Because of the extra keys at the outer edges, raising the middle edges upwards lifts the center keys considerably, which brings my wrists and forearms off the desk instead of letting them rest. Holding them like that created extra neck and shoulder strain on my part, which is sort of the opposite of the goal. But if you\u2019re not into tenting anyway and want a flat, Alice-split board with an adjustable splay, this works quite well.\nKinesis Form Split Touchpad Keyboard\nThe idea behind the Kinesis Form Split Touchpad Keyboard is pretty ergonomic: put the trackpad between the two halves and minimize travel for your mouse hand. The distance between the two puts your elbows at a comfortable distance and keeps your wrist nearly in-line with your forearms. The build is excellent, with low profile mechanical switches that feel smooth and just the right amount of clacky. The trackpad is responsive, but gestures only work with Windows computers. Even dragging and dropping doesn\u2019t work on a Mac here, so I don\u2019t see Apple users getting much use out of the board. I also found myself wishing for the slightest rotation of the keys \u2014 though they\u2019re a good distance apart, a slight angle would keep my wrists fully unbent. There\u2019s no tenting or negative tilt either, both of which could help a bit more, ergonomically speaking.\nLogitech Wavekeys\nWhile it's a perfectly fine and affordable Bluetooth keyboard, the Logitech Wavekeys has minimal ergonomics. The keys rise up slightly in the middle and there's a comfortable wrist rest attached, but the layout is the same as any other keyboard, with no splitting of the keys to open up your arms or keep your wrists straight.\nErgonomic keyboard FAQs\nWhat kinds of ergonomic keyboard styles are there?\nMost ergonomic keyboards fall into two categories: fully split which separates the board into two pieces, and unibody split, also known as an Alice design, which angles the keys outward at the bottom. When the keys are rotated outward or split into two halves, it allows for a wider spread between your elbows for a more relaxed typing position. Other ergonomic features, such as thumb clusters, center tenting and negative tilting are sometimes added to either type of board.\nWhich keyboard layout is the most ergonomic?\nSince every person is different, there\u2019s no one best ergonomic keyboard layout. The standard QWERTY layout is what most people are used to. The Dvorak, Colemak and Workman layouts rearrange the board to put the more commonly used letters closer to the home-key position. All three are intended to minimize your finger movements. That may indeed feel more comfortable and less fatiguing, but people used to the QWERTY layout will likely need to relearn how to type.\nWhen do I need a split keyboard?\nYou might feel some relief with a fully split keyboard if you find yourself tensing up at the shoulders as you type on a standard board. Putting some distance between your hands may allow your chest to stay more open, which for some is an easier position to maintain. You may also appreciate being able to place your mouse or trackpad between the two halves of the board to minimize the distance your cursor hand needs to travel."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best docking stations for laptops in 2025\nWe tested Thunderbolt and USB-C docks for PCs, Chromebooks and MacBooks to find the best ones.\nComputing power is reaching dizzying new heights, but if your laptop doesn\u2019t have all the ports you need to wield that power, you may want to consider a docking station. These are a little different from USB-C hubs, which tend to be smaller and don\u2019t require power. Docking stations typically offer between seven and 12 ports, require a DC power supply and cost between $100 and $400. They allow you to connect monitors, cameras, mics, wired mice and keyboards, storage devices and more \u2014 all through a single USB-C port on your laptop. We tested more than a dozen highly regarded models to help you pick the best docking station for your needs. This guide also breaks down the various cable standards and port types to help you make an informed purchase..\nTable of contents\nBest docking stations\nHost connection: Thunderbolt 5 | Number of downstream ports: 8 | Power delivery to host: 90W | USB-C: 3 x TB5, 2 x USB-C 3.2 v2 | USB-A: 3 @ 10Gb/s | Monitor: 3x Thunderbolt 5 | Aux 3.5mm: No | SD Card: No | Ethernet: No\nCalDigit calls the Element 5 a hub \u2014 and it does have some hub-like qualities, namely its compact size. But it requires a DC power source, costs $300 and gives you three downstream Thunderbolt 5 ports plus two additional USB-C connections. That\u2019s far more powerful than any hub I\u2019ve tested. Perhaps as more manufacturers adopt the Thunderbolt 5 standard, this will become the new normal for hubs. But for now, I\u2019m calling it a docking station.\nThe Thunderbolt 5 standard for USB connections enables higher video resolution, higher bandwidth for data and a higher wattage power delivery. Right now, you can find TB5 ports on just a handful of computers, such as MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and Max chips and the Razer Blade 18. I, like most people, don\u2019t have any of those speedy machines just yet, so I used the Element 5 with (still very capable!) Thunderbolt 4 ports.\nThe Element 5\u2019s port array is excellent. Its three downstream TB5 ports can handle two 4K monitors on compatible MacBooks and up to three monitors on compatible Windows laptops. It worked great running my one 4K and one HD monitor (both with adapters since my displays use HDMI ports) and I still had one more TB5 port to spare. I used it to perform some of the faster data transfers I\u2019ve clocked. The two additional (non Thunderbolt) USB-C ports connected my keyboard and a RODE mic. The three USB-A ports went to a mouse, streaming light and a thumb drive. Everything performed splendidly and the unit barely got warm.\nIt doesn\u2019t have a 3.5mm receptacle \u2014 which seems fine as the laptops I\u2019ve looked at that have TB5 ports come with a headphone jack. The Element 5 also lacks Ethernet and SD card slots. That was also fine for my needs.\nThe Element 5\u2019s design is sleek and the unit feels solid despite its small size. It's also reversible, with rubber feet you can install on either side of the hub, giving you flexibility on where you can stick it on your desk. A TB5 cable is included, which is crucial, since you can\u2019t tap into the faster speeds and bandwidth of the latest Thunderbolt standard without a compatible cable.\nAt the moment, there\u2019s probably a small segment of the population that absolutely needs a Thunderbolt 5 dock, but the price point here isn\u2019t out of range of other docks with a similar array of ports. If you\u2019re in the market for a versatile adapter, you may as well get a future-proof one.\nOf course, if your setup requires more than USB connections \u2014 perhaps you need another aux port, are using SD cards daily or want Ethernet \u2014 you can go for Kensington\u2019s EQ Thunderbolt 5 dock, detailed below as an honorable mention.\n- Three downstream Thunderbolt 5 ports\n- Five additional USB ports\n- Compact and attractive design\n- Reversible design\n- No Ethernet port or memory card slot\nHost connection: 2 x USB-C | Number of downstream ports: 8 | Power delivery to host: 75W (USB-C) | USB-C: 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x 3.1 | USB-A: 2 | Monitor: 2 x HDMI 2.0, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4 | Aux 3.5mm: No | SD Card: No | Ethernet: Yes\nThe Satechi Dual Dock Stand is different from all the other docks we tested in two respects: it doesn\u2019t require a power source and it goes beneath your MacBook instead of beside it. You could almost classify it as a hub, but I think the high number of ports earns it docking-station status.\nIt plugs into the two USB-C ports at the side of a Mac, which allows MacBooks with M1, M2 or M3 Pro or Max chips to operate dual monitors in extended mode. Unfortunately, MacBooks with standard M1 or M2 chips, can natively only power a second external display in mirrored mode. The new MacBook Air with the M3 chip can only power two displays in extended mode with the laptop lid closed. If you have a Mac with a standard chip and need two monitors, you'll need a docking station that supports DisplayLink hardware and software, such as the Kensington SD4780P, which is our top pick for Chromebooks.\nSince the Dual Dock works without power, it\u2019s a lot easier to set up than other docks with transformer boxes and DC cables. I found it made the most sense to just use the MagSafe connector on the laptop, but you can also supply power to the dock using the non-data USB-C port and it will pass 75 watts to your machine.\nBoth the 4K and HD monitors I tested looked great and worked well in extended mode. There are two USB-Cs for a webcam and mic, plus two USB-As which could be used for a dongle mouse and a streaming light \u2014 that\u2019s likely enough ports for conferencing or even a basic video creator setup. The dock is ultimately limited by the fact that none of the USB-C connections are Thunderbolt and there are only two USB-A sockets to work with. But it\u2019s a great choice for extending productivity in a way that tucks beneath a MacBook, neatly moving the cords to the back of the machine and out of the way. It even has an SSD enclosure beneath it.\n- Unique design complements MacBooks\n- Can power two monitors on Macs with M1 Pro or M2 Pro chips\n- Good variety of ports\n- Just two USB-A ports\n- No Thunderbolt ports\nHost connection: Thunderbolt 5 | Number of downstream ports: 10 | Power delivery to host: 140W | USB-C: 3 x TB5 | USB-A: 3 | Monitor: 3 x TB5 | Aux 3.5mm: No | SD Card: Yes, microSD and SD | Ethernet: Yes\nWhile I think most people looking for a dock with Thunderbolt 5 capabilities will be happy with CalDigit\u2019s Element 5, Kensinton\u2019s SD5000T5 EQ is a worthy option for those who want a more specific set of ports. This feels more like a traditional docking station, with a larger slab footprint that lays flat on a desk. You get a total of ten downstream ports, including three that are Thunderbolt 5. That\u2019ll take care of your monitor needs (adapters for DisplayPort or HDMI displays).\nBut it's worth noting that there aren't any non-Thunderbolt USB-C ports. So if you have, say, a USB-C keyboard, sticking it into a Thunderbolt 5 socket might feel like a waste of power. The three USB Type A ports support the 3.2 Gen 2 standard which can handle 10Gbps data transfers.\nIt has both an SD card reader and a microSD slot, which could be useful for photographers and other creators who need to phyically transfer files often (though again, an adapter and a TB port will work for that, too). The Ethernet port, rated at 2.5Gbps, should serve those who like a wired internet connection. And there\u2019s a headphone jack in case you have an additional device that needs it. It also accepts Kensington locks so you can physically lock down your dock.\nMy pretty basic setup didn\u2019t even make it moderately warm and everything I connected worked as well as if I\u2019d plugged it directly into my computer.\n- Has a variety of ports including memory card slots and Ethernet\n- Max power delivery of 140W\n- Just three downstream USB-C ports\nHost connection: Thunderbolt 4 | Number of downstream ports: 10 | Power delivery to host: 96W (DC) | USB-C: 3 x TB4 | USB-A: 2 | Monitor: 2 x HDMI 2.0 | Aux 3.5mm: Yes | SD Card: Yes | Ethernet: Yes\nIt\u2019s as though Satechi called me up and asked for the design of my ideal docking station. They didn\u2019t, to be clear, but the Thunderbolt 4 Multi-Display manages to get right what so many docks almost do. First off, there are enough downstream USB4 ports to handle a variety of setups, whether you like a Mr. Universe-style monitor array or just want to run a USB-C keyboard at the same time as your webcam and still have a port left over. You also get dual HDMI 2.0 connections, an Ethernet jack, two USB-A ports, an SD card slot and a headphone jack.\nThat\u2019s only a total of 10 downstream ports but for most people they\u2019re the ones that offer the most versatility. The trio of Thunderbolt 4 ports can support up to 8K monitors at 60Hz and 40 Gbps data transfers. They can even deliver 15 watts of power if you just need to charge your phone while you work.\nYou can also hook up your screens via HDMI. MacBook users will need to install the DisplayLink driver to work around Apple\u2019s extended monitor limitations. With the software, even M1 and M2 MacBooks can hook up two external monitors in extended mode. Windows laptops and M2/M3 Pro and Max chips can have up to four extended monitors connected \u2014 two via the Thunderbolt ports and two through the HDMI connections (again using DisplayLink tech).\nIn addition to the goldilocks multiport selection, the arrangement of those ports is quite logical. From this slim and sleek slab, a host connection lives on one side, allowing for one neat line to your computer. Connections that are likely to stay put (monitors, DC power, Ethernet and Thunderbolts) are all around back, while the jacks you\u2019ll probably switch up more often, such as the USB-A for thumb drives, the 3.5mm jack for headphones and the SD card reader, are in the front. Right next to those is a handy on-off switch, so you can easily turn off all your peripherals at night to reduce your power draw.\nThe dock delivers on the promise of its clever port selection and arrangement. My dual extended monitors looked great and achieved the advertised refresh rates and resolutions, the data transfers were smoking quick and I was able to (finally) fully connect my very basic setup without compromise: Two monitors, a webcam, streaming light, microphone, keyboard and mouse. I did notice my 4K monitor had the slightest lag when the second monitor was plugged in, but it was minor and only noticeable when displaying the webcam video.\nOne minor criticism is the DisplayLink and Thunderbolt branding across the front and top. They distract from the otherwise elegant look of the high-end aluminum exterior. One not-so-minor concern is how warm the unit got as I used it over the course of a couple days. At times, it was nearly too hot to hold my hand on comfortably. I never noticed any adverse performance effects as a result, but it\u2019s possible that could become an issue in the long term. As for price, it\u2019s listed at $300; that\u2019s not the most expensive dock we\u2019ve tested, but it\u2019s certainly not the cheapest. But for the performance and thoughtful design, it\u2019s a Thunderbolt dock that could be worth it for a lot of people.\n- Excellent array of ports\n- Ports cleverly arranged\n- Can support up to four external monitors\n- DisplayLink driver allows for dual extended monitors on standard-chip MacBooks\n- Lay-flat design can take up a lot of desk space without a mount\n- Unit runs very hot\nHost connection: Thunderbolt 4 | Number of downstream ports: 16 | Power delivery to host: 98W (DC) | USB-C: 2 x TB4, 3 x 3.2 | USB-A: 5 | Monitor: 1 x DisplayPort 1.4 | Aux 3.5mm: 1 x audio combo, 1 x audio in, 1 x audio out | SD Card: SD and microSD | Ethernet: Yes\nThere\u2019s a lot to appreciate about CalDigit\u2019s TS4 docking station: It has a sturdy, upright design with a host connection at the rear and a whopping five downstream USB-C ports, two of which are Thunderbolt 4, the other two are USB 3.2, which can support transfers of up to 10 Gbps.\nUp front, you get an SD and a microSD card slot along with a headphone jack, two USB-C and a USB-A connector. In back, there\u2019s room for four more USB-A devices and two 3.5mm jacks, one for audio in and one for audio out. One area where the dock may feel lacking is in display inputs. It only has one DisplayPort 1.4, but it has plenty of TB4 ports, which you can easily use to outfit a full command center (if you don\u2019t have a USB-C monitor, there are plenty of adapters).\nThe multi-gig Ethernet jack can handle up to 2.5Gbps, so if you\u2019re paying for a screaming-fast internet plan, this dock can help you take advantage of it. The TS4 can deliver up to 98W of power to your laptop, though like any docking station, the wattage goes down when other items are also drawing power.\nThe TS4 worked equally well with my MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS13 Plus and was even compatible with a Chromebook. I tested read/write speeds on a Samsung T7 SSD via a Thunderbolt port and got 734 MB/s read and 655 MB/s write speeds on the Mac and 1048/994 on the Dell. Compared to the other docks, that was in the lower-middle range for the Mac and the fastest overall for the PC. On PC, it also handled a 1GB folder transfer to a flash drive faster than any other dock and delivered the fastest connection speeds over the Ethernet. It\u2019s the only unit that let me plug in every single peripheral I had on hand at once. If you\u2019ve got lots of tech you want to use simultaneously (and money isn\u2019t a concern), this is the one to get.\nCalDigit\u2019s new TS5, which offers a similar array of ports and supports Thunderbolt 5 connections is on our list of docks to test and we\u2019ll update this guide once we\u2019ve spent some time with it.\n- An abundance of ports\n- Compact, upright design\n- 2.5Gbps Ethernet port\n- Expensive\nHost connection: USB-C | Number of downstream ports: 12 | Power delivery to host: 100W (DC) | USB-C: 1 x 3.1 | USB-A: 5 | Monitor: 2 x HDMI 2.0, 2 x DisplayPort 1.2 | Aux 3.5mm: 1 x audio combo | SD Card: No | Ethernet: Yes\nThe Kensington SD4780P Dual 4K typically requires a DisplayLink driver, but any Chromebook made after 2017 supports the connection from the jump. Finding a docking station that works with ChromeOS is tough; of the 12 units I tested, only four connected at all with the Acer Chromebook Spin 514, and one of those four couldn\u2019t run two monitors. The SD4780P uses a USB-C host connection, through which it offers a maximum power delivery of 100W and was able to run both the 4K and HD screens cleanly.\nIt allows for a wide range of USB-A peripherals through five such ports, but there\u2019s only a single downstream USB-C, so I wasn\u2019t able to use both a webcam and mic at the same time. That means you\u2019ll need to use your Chromebook\u2019s built-in ports if you want more than one of those types of devices set up. The plastic build makes it look a little cheap and I\u2019m not crazy about the lay-flat design, but the host port is in the back, which will make your setup neater. If all you\u2019re looking for is a way to get a few extra monitors and use your wired USB accessories, this is a good pick for Chromebooks.\n- Works well with Chromebooks\n- Five USB-A ports\n- Requires a driver for non Chromebooks\n- Just one downstream USB-C\nWhat to look for in a docking station\nFirst and foremost, consider what you need to plug in. This will likely be the deciding factor when you go to actually buy a docking station. Do you need three screens for an expanded work view? A quick way to upload photos from an SD card? Are you looking to plug in a webcam, mic and streaming light, while simultaneously taking advantage of faster Ethernet connections? Are you hooking up a gaming laptop to multiple displays and peripherals? Once you\u2019ve settled on the type of ports you need, you may also want to consider the generation of those ports as well; even ports with the same shape can have different capabilities. Here\u2019s a brief overview of the connectivity different docking stations offer.\nMonitor ports\nExternal monitors typically need one of three ports to connect to a PC: HDMI, DisplayPort or USB-C. HDMI connections are more common than DisplayPort and the cables and devices that use them are sometimes more affordable. The most popular version of the DisplayPort interface (v1.4) can handle higher resolutions and refresh rates than the most common HDMI version (2.0). All of the display docking stations with HDMI ports that we recommend here use version 2.0, which can handle 4K resolution at 60Hz or 1080p up to 240Hz. The DisplayPort-enabled docks support either version 1.2, which allows for 4K resolution at 60Hz, or version 1.4, which can handle 8K at 60Hz or 4K at 120Hz.\nYou can also use your dock\u2019s downstream (non-host) Thunderbolt ports to hook up your monitors. If your external display has a USB-C socket, you can connect directly. If you have an HDMI display or DisplayPort-only monitor, you can use an adapter or a conversion cable.\nOf course, the number of monitors you can connect and the resolutions/rates they\u2019ll achieve depend on both your computer\u2019s GPU and your monitors \u2014 and the more monitors you plug in can bring down those numbers as well. Be sure to also use cables that support the bandwidth you\u2019re hoping for. MacOS users should keep in mind that MacBooks with the standard M1 or M2 chips support just one external monitor natively and require DisplayLink hardware and software to support two external displays. MacBook Pros with M1 Pro, M2 Pro or M2 Max chips can run multiple monitors from a single port, as can MacBook Air and Pro models with M3 or M4 chips.\nUSB ports\nMost docking stations offer a few USB Type-A ports, which are great for peripherals like wired mice and keyboards, bus-powered ring lights and flash drives. For faster data transfer speeds to your flash drive, go for USB-A sockets labeled 3.1 or 3.2 \u2014 or better yet, use a USB-C Thunderbolt port.\nType-C USB ports come in many different flavors. While they\u2019re all the same shape, different standards and terms mean different abilities. A USB-C port (or cable) that meets the 3.2 gen 2 specification can handle data at 10Gbps, which can support 4K video at 60 fps. If it\u2019s also a PD (power delivery) port, it can, well, deliver power too. Thunderbolt is Intel\u2019s implementation of the USB4 standard and the Thunderbolt 3, 4 and, since 2023, Thunderbolt 5 protocols all support power (from 15W to 140W), video (up to 8K on multiple screens) and data (from 16Gbps to 120Gbps). Since a similarly shaped port can vary widely on what it can do, it\u2019s worth figuring out what you need those ports to do when you\u2019re assessing your needs \u2014 all USB4 ports are USB-C, but not all USB-C ports support USB4. (Don\u2019t worry, it confuses us, too.)\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that achieving the fastest speeds will depend on factors like the cables you use \u2014 a $4 USB-C charging cable won\u2019t transmit data at Thunderbolt speeds, no matter what port you plug it into. The devices on either end of the dock must support those speeds as well.\nNearly every dock available today is a USB-C docking station, connecting to a computer via USB-C, often Thunderbolt, and those host ports are nearly always labeled with a laptop icon. Host ports also allow power delivery to your laptop: available wattage varies, but most docks are rated between 85 and 140 watts. That should be enough to keep most computers powered \u2014 it also means you won\u2019t have to take up an extra laptop connector for charging.\nOther ports\nNone of our currently recommended laptops include an Ethernet jack; a docking station can help get that connection back. Whether you need a wired internet connection is dependent on a few factors. Wi-Fi 6 connections can deliver theoretical data rates of 9Gbps, but in practice those numbers are between 800 and 1200Mbps. The Ethernet ports on some routers and gateways top out at 1Gbps, so your Wi-Fi connection could actually be faster. It might be worth testing your speeds and checking your router\u2019s specs to see whether Ethernet is better for your needs.\nJust two of our favorite laptops have SD card readers, and if you need a quick way to upload files from cameras or audio recorders, you may want to get a dock with one of those slots. Of the docks we tested, about half had SD readers. For now, most (but not all) laptops still include a 3.5mm audio jack, but if you prefer wired headphones and want a more accessible place to plug them in, many docking stations will provide.\nWhen you\u2019re counting up the ports for your new dock, remember that most companies include the host port (the one that connects to your computer) in the total number. So if you\u2019re looking for a dock with three Thunderbolt connections, be sure to check whether one of them will be used to plug in your laptop.\nDesign\nMost docking stations have either a lay-flat or upright design. Most docks put the more \u201cpermanent\u201d connections in back \u2014 such as Ethernet, DC power, monitor connections and a few USBs. Up-front USB ports can be used for flash drive transfers, or even acting as a charger for your phone (just make sure the port can deliver the power you need). USBs in the rear are best for keyboards, mice, webcams and other things you\u2019re likely to always use. Some docks position the host port up front, which might make it easier to plug in your laptop when you return to your desk, but a host port in back may look neater overall.\nHow we tested docking stations\nWe started out by looking at online reviews, spec sheets from various brands and docking stations that our fellow tech sites have covered. We considered brands we\u2019ve tested before and have liked, and weeded out anything that didn\u2019t have what we consider a modern suite of connections (such as a dock with no downstream USB-C ports). We narrowed it down to 12 contenders and I tested each dock in a home office, using an M1 MacBook Pro, a Dell XPS 13 Plus and an Acer Chromebook Spin 514.\nI plugged in and evaluated the quality of the connections for 12 different peripherals including a 4K and an HD monitor, a 4K and an HD webcam, plus USB devices like a mouse, keyboard, streaming light and mic. I plugged in wired earbuds, and transferred data to a USB-C flash drive and an external SSD. I ran basic speed tests on the Ethernet connections as well as the file transfers. I judged how easy the docks were to use as well as the various design factors I described earlier. I made spreadsheets and had enough wires snaking around my work area that my cat stayed off my desk for three weeks (a new record).\nAs new docking stations come out and we find models worthy of testing, (there are a couple from Ugreen we have our eye on), we'll update this guide accordingly.\nOther laptop docking stations we tested\nPlugable USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 Hub\nI was hoping the Plugable USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 Hub would make a good budget pick. Its small size makes it seem more like a hub than a dock, but it requires power from the included DC adapter, so I tested it as a dock. I liked how little space it took up, but it was almost too small \u2014 it was too lightweight to lay flat on my desk when all the cables were plugged in. It has just three Thunderbolt 4 ports. That\u2019s not a ton, but TB4 ports are certainly versatile, handling monitors and other higher-specced peripherals. It\u2019s only $100 (Plugable even includes an HDMI to USB-C adapter) which is a pretty great price for multiple Thunderbolt connections. I experienced some display lags in my tests, so I hesitate to give it a full recommendation.\nPlugable TBT4-UDZ\nWhen I pulled the Plugable TBT4-UDZ Thunderbolt 4 out of the box, I was convinced it would make the cut: It has a practical upright design, an attractive metal finish, and the host connection is TB4. While there are plenty of USB-A and monitor ports, there\u2019s just one downstream USB-C. A modern dock, particularly one that costs $300, should let you run, say, a USB-C cam and mic at the same time. Otherwise, it\u2019s pretty limiting.\nAnker 575 USB-C\nAt $250 (and more often $235), the Anker 575 USB-C could make for a good budget pick for Windows. It performed well with the Dell XPS 13 Plus, but had trouble with the third screen, the 4K webcam and headphone jack when connected to the MacBook Pro. It\u2019s quite compact, which means it can get wobbly when a bunch of cables are plugged in, but it has a good selection of ports and was able to handle my basic setup well.\nBelkin Connect Pro Thunderbolt 4\nBelkin\u2019s Connect Pro Thunderbolt 4 Dock is a contender for a Thunderbolt 4 alternative. It has nearly the same ports as the AD2010 (minus the microSD slot) and an attractive rounded design \u2014 but it\u2019s $90 more, so I\u2019d only recommend getting it if you find it on sale.\nAcer USB Type-C Dock\nAcer\u2019s USB Type-C Dock D501 costs $10 more than our Kensington pick for Chromebooks, but it performs similarly and is worth a mention. It has nearly the same ports (including the rather limiting single downstream USB-C) but both the Ethernet and data transfer speeds were faster.\nDocking station FAQs\nAre docking stations worth it?\nDocking stations are worth it if you have more accessories to plug in than your laptop permits. Say you have a USB-C camera and mic, plus a USB-A mouse, keyboard and streaming light; very few modern laptops have enough connections to support all of that at once. A docking station can make that setup feasible while also giving you extra ports like a gigabit Ethernet connection, and supplying power to your laptop. However, if you just need a few extra USB sockets, you might be better off going with a hub, as those tend to be cheaper.\nHow much does a laptop dock cost?\nLaptop docking stations tend to be bigger and more expensive than simple USB-A or USB-C hubs, thanks to the wider array of connections. You can find them as low as $50 and they can get as expensive as $450. A reasonable price for a dock with a good selection of ports from a reputable brand will average around $200.\nHow do I set up my laptop dock?\nMost docking stations are plug and play. First, connect the DC power cable to the dock and a wall outlet. Then look for the \u201chost\u201d or upstream port on the dock \u2014 it\u2019s almost always a USB-C/Thunderbolt port and often branded with an icon of a laptop. Use the provided cable to connect to your computer. After that, you can connect your peripherals to the dock and they should be ready to use with your laptop. A few docking stations, particularly those that handle more complex monitor setups, require a driver. The instructions that come with your dock will point you to a website where you can download that companion software.\nDoes a laptop charge on a docking station?\nNearly all docking stations allow you to charge your laptop through the host connection (the cable running from the dock to your computer). That capability, plus the higher number of ports is what separates a docking station from a hub. Docks can pass on between 65W and 100W of power to laptops, and nearly all include a DC adapter.\nAre all docking stations compatible with all laptops?\nNo, not all docking stations are compatible with every laptop. In our tests, the Chromebook had the biggest compatibility issues, the Dell PC had the least, and the MacBook fell somewhere in between. All docks will list which brands and models they work with on the online product page \u2014 be sure to also check the generation of your laptop as some docks can\u2019t support certain chips.\nWhat are some popular docking station brands?\nKensington, Anker, Pluggable and Belkin are reputable and well-known brands making docking stations for all laptops. Lenovo, Dell and HP all make docks that will work with their own computers as well as other brands."
