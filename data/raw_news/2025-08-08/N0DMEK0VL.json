  "description": "The insight stems from an encounter between Status's Oliver Darcy and Paramount Skydance Co-CEO George Cheeks that occurred Thursday at the company's first press conference.",
  "content": "Jon Stewart's show could be coming to an end, after the star spoke out about his parent company Paramount's decision to settle Donald Trump's $20billion lawsuit.\n\nThe insight stems from an encounter between Status's Oliver Darcy and Paramount Skydance Co-CEO George Cheeks that occurred Thursday at the company's first press conference since being bought out by Skydance Media for $8billion.\n\nDarcy asked Cheeks asked about Stewart, who three weeks ago revealed he wasn't sure whether Paramount Skydance - the company now run by 42-year-old David Ellison - would cancel his show when his contract runs out in December.\n\nCheeks reportedly responded by asserting it was 'day one' of the new company, suggesting no decision had been made. Darcy, a former CNN reporter, pointed out renewals are usually negotiated months in advance.\n\nCheeks' answer did not change - hinting at potential career trouble for Stewart, according to Darcy.\n\nMoments before, Darcy asked Cheeks about Stephen Colbert, who has continued to cast doubt on CBS and Paramount's statement that his show was canceled purely for financial reasons.\n\nCheeks - the exec who pulled the plug on the program - reportedly said he 'didn't really know' where his relationship stood with Colbert, at this point. According to Darcy, that 'said plenty.'\n\nStewart's Daily Show just recorded its highest quarterly ratings in a decade, months after Stewart's return to hosting Mondays after stepping away in 2015.\n\nSince then, Stewart has flamed his parent company and CBS for pandering to the president, using both his 'Weekly Show' podcast and Comedy Central show as platforms. Comedy Central is owned by Paramount Skydance.\n\n'They haven't called me and said like, \"Don't get too comfortable in that office, Stewart,\"' he joked last month on his podcast.\n\n'But let me tell you something, I've been kicked out of sh*ttier establishments than that. We'll land on our feet. No, I honestly don't know.'\n\nThe assertion came on the heels of a separate report from Status that also suggested Skydance could let him go - or even cancel his show altogether as Cheeks did to Colbert's.\n\nThe move was made just prior to the merger, furthering the idea CBS reached a $16 million settlement in a suit filed by Trump just to secure FCC approval for the sale, which was in limbo in months.\n\nStewart, 62, said on his July 8 show that the payment reeked of 'fealty' and 'sound[ed] illegal.'\n\n'No one can ever kiss his a*s enough,' he said of Trump, complaining news networks like CBS were 'being held to a standard that will never be satisfactory to [him].'\n\nCBS revealed Colbert was being canned just days later, after nearly a decade of him being a thorn in Trump's side.\n\nStewart quickly took to his show again to make clear he did not buy CBS's claim the cancellation was 'purely for financial reasons\u2019 and again accused execs like Cheeks of capitulating to Trump to secure the sale.\n\n'I believe CBS lost the benefit of the doubt two weeks prior when they sold out their flagship news program to pay an extortion fee to said president,' he said on-air on July 21, adding, 'Andy Rooney must have been rolling over in his bed.'\n\nHe continued: 'I understand the corporate fear. I understand the fear that you and your advertisers have with $8 billion at stake. But understand this.\n\n'Truly, the shows that you now seek to cancel, censor, and control? A not-insignificant portion of that $8 billion value came from those f**king shows.\n\n'That\u2019s what made you that money. Shows that say something. Shows that take a stand.'\n\nHe told execs: 'If you believe you can make yourselves so innocuous, that you can serve a gruel so flavorless, that you will never again be on the boy king\u2019s radar... Why will anyone watch you?'\n\nEllison, the son of MAGA supporting billionaire, Larry Ellison, has said he and Skydance had nothing to do with the decision to cancel Colbert, which also has high ratings.\n\nOthers, like David Letterman, have said Cheeks and others at Paramount pulled the plug via a backdoor deal at the behest of Skydance, to stay on the president's good side.\n\nDaily Mail has reached out to Paramount Skydance for comment.",

      "text": "Embarrassing REAL reason Stephen Colbert's show was canceled after bosses hatched plot while star vacationed\nCBS canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert because it was losing $40 million a year, according to a new report.\nPuck journalist Matthew Belloni revealed Colbert's astonishing lack of profitability Friday, hours after CNN first broke the news that the show was canceled because it was in the red.\nBelloni outlined how The Late Show - whose cancelation was announced Thursday - costs $100m a year to produce, with Colbert, 61, getting paid between $15 million and $20 million a year to host.\nColbert beats ABC and NBC rivals Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon in the ratings, but that still wasn't enough to save him.\nLate night shows have slumped in profitability in recent years as viewers shun the format in favor of streaming services or watching content on their phones.\nAdvertiser revenue has slumped sharply even in the last three years, Puck reported, making it harder to pull Colbert's show out of the red.\nColbert was reported to be 'not angry, actually' about his cancelation and was chatting with his staff in a 'matter-of-fact' way before Thursday's show, Puck reported.\nColbert, who will broadcast his final show in May 2026, was first informed his show was on the chopping block around July 4, it is claimed. Paramount Co-CEO George Cheeks made the decision, Puck reported.\nCBS pulled the plug on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ' solely for financial reasons, insiders at the network have said. Pictured, the veteran host telling viewers his show will be off the air by this time next year on Thursday\nCBS execs weighed the pros and cons of canceling the increasingly unprofitable show during its hosts usual summer vacation this month, sources told CNN Friday. They said the move was financially driven even while speaking anonymously, as did insiders who spoke to Puck\nHe the went on vacation, giving bosses at CBS time to plot behind his back, CNN reported.\nColbert had news of his cancelation confirmed Thursday.\nHe moved to share it as quickly as possible so that his staff would not learn of their impending unemployment via leaks to the press.\nAll three major late night hosts - Colbert, Kimmel and Fallon - have become notorious for their regular rants about President Trump, which many viewers have complained are boring and off-putting.\nBut Belloni said he didn't believe the famously anti-MAGA Colbert was axed to appease Donald Trump, who recently won a $15 million payout from CBS after suing them over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris he said was deceptively edited.\nThe axing of Colbert has delighted Trump, who posted about it on his TruthSocial network earlier today.\nColbert's ouster could also make it easier for CBS parent company Paramount's efforts to merge with media company Skydance in a deal that must be approved by Trump's Federal Communications Commission.\nParamount Co-CEO George Cheeks made the decision to do away with the show after years of conversations about whether it was worth airing, sources told Puck and CNN\nThe news comes as David Ellison's (right) company, Skydance, comes closer to purchasing Paramount (Pictured: David with his multi-billionaire father and GOP backer Larry Ellison).The two had no involvement in the decision, according to those familiar\nEarlier this week, Colbert bashed his bossed for settling with Trump, branding the deal a 'big fat bribe.' He still rakes in an average of 2.417 million viewers a year\nColbert's axing came just days after he sniped at CBS bosses for settling with Trump, branding the deal a 'big fat bribe.'\nThe Late Show launched in 1993 under David Letterman to compete with longtime late night juggernaut The Tonight Show.\nColbert took over from Letterman in 2015 after his retirement.\nMore than three decades later, CBS's entry into the late night sphere sits at the top, with second-best Jimmy Kimmel Live! raking in an average of 1.772 million viewers.\nColbert, by comparison, collects an average of 2.417 million.\nColbert - who once played a conservative character on Comedy Central's satirical late night program The Colbert Report - often aired jokes at the conservative's expense.\nTrump celebrated the news of the show's cancellation as a result.\n'I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,' he wrote in a Friday Truth Social post.\n'I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert,' he added, before talking up right-wing Fox New star Greg Gutfeld.\n'[He's] better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show,' Trump added, referring to Jimmy Fallon.\nTrump previously worked for NBC during his days on 'The Apprentice.'"

'The consensus is that Jon Stewart's interview was awful. It seemed like he hadn't read up on the guy.'\nAnother called Stewart's approach 'totally bizarre,' given his reputation for needling guests.\nJon Stewart's sit-down with billionaire Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong came after a monologue in which the host slammed media companies who water down their content to avoid backlash from the Trump administration\nSoon-Shiong, the owner of the Times since 2018, is one of several media magnates who have been accused of bending the knee to Donald Trump\n'No questions about [Soon-Shiong] destroying LAT's reputation? Nothing about his sucking up to Trump/RFK?' the insider said.\n'Especially coming right after Stewart ripped Paramount, just baffling.'\nStewart didn't broach the subject of Soon-Shiong's false claim that his paper does not cover his pharmaceutical business, Status pointed out, noting that an undisclosed advertisement for his business was featured on one of the Times' audio shows in March.\nStatus reported on speculation that Soon-Shiong - the inventor of a popular cancer drug - is looking for a clear path for future approval of more drugs.\nDuring the conversation, Soon-Shiong also announced plans to take the Times public - a revelation that one angry staffer told Breaker Media served as an example 'of the fly-by-night nature of how this paper is being run.'\n'This is indicative of everything with him,' another reporter told Politico.\n'He doesn't talk to us. He doesn't have newsroom meetings. We only get a sense of what he's feeling via Twitter rant or when he randomly decides to save some pocket change and fire 12 people.'\nImmediately after the presidential election, a longtime Times columnist claimed that a piece for the editorial page's opinion section that was critical of Trump had been spiked by Soon-Shiong.\nSoon-Shiong was one of about a dozen wealthy executives, including Open AI's Sam Altman and former First Buddy Elon Musk, who has lunch with Trump in Riyadh in May\nSoon-Shiong acquired the Times in 2018, as part of a $500million deal. The past three years have been plagued by layoffs, the most recent of which saw at least 115 staffers in the newsroom let go in January\n'The consensus is that Jon Stewart's interview was awful,' one Times staffer said. 'It seemed like he hadn't read up on the guy'\nThe columnist and several others quit in protest.\nOthers accused Soon-Shiong of pulling the Harris endorsement because he 'wanted to hedge his bets' in case Trump won.\nIn February, Status reported on pushback against Soon-Shiong following an appearance on Dr. Drew Pinsky's YouTube show, in which he offered repeated praise for Trump and was briefly challenged by the host over his paper's coverage of him.\nOther moves that have been met with pushback include Soon-Shiong hosting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s wife, Cheryl Hines, to the paper's offices in February, for talks about a proposed right-leaning version of The View featuring far-right personalities like Candace Owens and Rob Schneider.\nThat same month, Soon-Shiong brought conservative CNN commentator Scott Jennings onto his paper's editorial board.\nSoon-Shiong acquired the Times in 2018, as part of a $500million deal. The past three years have been plagued by layoffs, the most recent of which saw at least 115 staffers in the newsroom let go in January.\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Stewart's people for comment concerning his oversights."

(Courtesy of Paramount)\nOn Thursday afternoon, just hours after Skydance\u2019s deal to officially take over Paramount closed, David Ellison strode onto a stage at the company\u2019s global headquarters in Times Square for his first press conference as the new boss. Flanked by senior lieutenants Jeff Shell, Gerry Cardinale, and Andy Gordon, Ellison fielded questions from a room full of reporters.\nNaturally, the assembled group of journalists didn\u2019t ignore the elephant in the room, and the first was about Donald Trump. Specifically, whether Ellison, the Silicon Valley tech scion, had cut a secret side deal to air upwards of $20 million worth of public service announcements for causes Trump supports. Ellison responded by distancing himself from Paramount\u2019s widely-criticized $16 million settlement over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment, noting it had been handled by a mediator under previous leadership. The company has complied with all laws, including anti-bribery statutes, he added.\nOf course, that non-answer didn\u2019t satisfy the press corps. A reporter flatly followed up by asking: \u201cDo you have a deal with Donald Trump to give him free...advertising air time? Is that true?\" It was a yes or no type question, but Ellison did not answer it in such a manner. The Oracle heir instead insisted he wouldn\u2019t \u201cpoliticize\u201d anything, saying he wanted Paramount to appeal to \u201ceveryone,\u201d and that he\u2019d already been \u201cclear\u201d on the matter\u2014though he obviously hadn\u2019t.\nStill, he deserves credit for facing unscreened questions for roughly 45 minutes.

But an insider told the Daily Mail that the three shows are actually losing closer to half that amount when taking into account revenue generated through sources like streaming and digital - though conceded they're still in the red.\nThe news come days after CBS announced the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, amid reports his program was losing $40 million per year.\nMany, including Colbert - a longtime critic of President Donald Trump - cited political motivations in the decision to pull the plug.\nBut as the speculation swirls over CBS's decision, industry experts told the Daily Mail that NBC's silence on its own hosts' futures speaks volumes.\n'They're letting the narrative take hold that Colbert was canceled purely for political reasons - and that works in their favor. It distracts from the financial bloodbath happening across the late-night industry,' said Rob Shuter, a veteran media columnist and author of Naughty But Nice.\n'NBC isn't denying the $100 million [loss] because if everyone's talking about politics, they're not talking about whether these shows are even sustainable anymore.'\nNBC late-night mainstays Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers could find themselves on the chopping block after helping the network lose an eye-watering $100 million-plus per year\nThe longtime hosts' shows, along with iconic NBC sketch comedy series SNL, have created the massive shortfall\nRobert Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, agreed.\n'NBC would want people to think that CBS canceled Colbert for political reasons, not viewership,' he said.\nAfter news of Colbert's cancellation emerged, the host called himself a 'martyr' and told Trump to 'Go f**k yourself' as the president gloated publicly over the decision.\nColbert had previously ripped the decision by CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit he filed over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\nThe settlement was seen by many as a necessary move by the company to earn the Trump administration's approval of its $8 million merger with Skydance. Colbert more bluntly called it 'a big, fat bribe.'\nColbert's Late Show has drawn hundreds of thousands more viewers than his closest late-night competitor, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, whose show has remained profitable when non-traditional TV advertising revenue is taken into account, a source told CNBC.\nAnd while Kimmel and Meyers have been more aggressive in taking on Trump, Fallon has avoided the pile-on.\n'If you're really making these deals Paramount are making, Colbert, Kimmel, and Meyers come off as a one-trick pony,' Thompson said.\nCBS announced the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , amid reports the program could be losing anywhere from $40 million to $100 million a year\nThe cancelation came shortly after Colbert criticized CBS parent company Paramount Global for paying $16 million to settle a lawsuit Trump filed over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris\nABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel 's show remains profitable when non-traditional TV advertising revenue is taken into account\n'Fallon was the only one who didn't completely alter their brand to make fun of the president.'\nShuter said Fallon's style could ultimately end up saving his skin - but not forever.\n'Fallon didn't pivot hard into anti-Trump satire, and that may have bought him time. But let's be clear - this isn't about politics anymore. It's about money,' he said.\n'The moment a format stops printing cash, the ideology behind it becomes a footnote.'"

Both of our shows reached an inflection point in 2015,' Stewart said Monday of the pair's shared success during their days on Comedy Central.\n'Stephen chose to challenge himself by seeing if he could succeed the legendary David Letterman in, quite frankly, a much bigger pond than the one he and I had been swimming in,' Stewart said. 'And I quit. And I quit.\n'Stephen challenged himself. I passed away. Stephen challenged his abilities and the biggest field you could.

'That's right. He is alive. Andy Rooney is alive.'\n'I understand the corporate fear. I understand the fear that you and your advertisers have with $8 billion at stake.

Stewart said Colbert went on to 'exceed all expectations' upon leaving Comedy Central for late-night, before acknowledging the fading format as a whole\n'That\u2019s what made you that money. Shows that say something. Shows that take a stand.'\nHe further asserted CBS and Paramount would be fools to cut Colbert loose, regardless of how much Trump may be pulling their proverbial strings.\nHe told worried executives, 'If you believe you can make yourselves so innocuous, that you can serve a gruel so flavorless, that you will never again be on the boy king\u2019s radar... Why will anyone watch you?\u201d\n'And you are f**king wrong,' he said of CBS reaching a settlement in the suit that had accused Paramount, CBS, and its flagship show 60 Minutes of deceptively editing an interview with Kamala Harris weeks before the election.\n'Do you want to know how impossible it is to stay on Lord Farquaad\u2019s good side?' Stewart joked.\nHe then pointed to Trump\u2019s $10illion lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox News, following a Wall Street Journal report that linked Trump to Jeffrey Epstein as proof of how quickly the conservative's alliances can grow cold.\n'Fox spends 24 hours a day blowing Trump, and it\u2019s not enough,' he said.\nColbert, 61, is one the most prominent of critics of the conservative and called himself a 'martyr' on Monday after the president gloated over The Late Show\u2019s cancellation in a pointed post to Truth Social over the weekend.\nAfter reflecting on their glory days, Stewart addressed the elephant in the room - controversy surrounding Colbert's employer, CBS. Colbert recently took a swipe at his bosses on-air - for accepting what he presented as a 'big fat bribe' from the president by reaching a settlement\nThe parties reached the $16 million settlement in a suit surrunding an Octobert 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris earlier this month.

      "text": "Journalism icon Dan Rather's blistering attack on CBS after network settled Trump lawsuit for $16m\nCBS News icon Dan Rather delivered a withering verdict on parent company Paramount's $16million settlement with Donald Trump over a contentious 60 Minutes interview, labeling the payout 'a sell-out to extortion by the president.'\n'It's a sad day for journalism,' the 93-year-old former CBS evening news anchor told Variety Wednesday while slamming Trump as a threat to the free press.\n'It's a sad day for 60 Minutes and CBS News... It was distortion by the president and a kneeling down and saying, \"yes, sir,\" by billionaire corporate owners.'\nRather argued that the settlement was not only unnecessary, but an example of censorship by Trump. He also warned of a greater threat to American democracy.\n'You settle a lawsuit when you've done something wrong,' Rather said. '60 Minutes did nothing wrong.'\nHe said that Trump strong-armed Paramount because Skydance's $8 billion acquisition of the company was at stake. The decision to make a deal was widely seen as necessary to receiving approval from the Trump administration.\n'Big billionaire business people make decisions about money,' he said.\n'We could always hope that they will make an exception when it comes to freedom of the press. But it wasn't to be.\nRetired CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather - seen here during his return to the network last year after 18 yeas - has branded Paramount's settlement with Trump 'a sell-out to extortion by the president'\nRather argued the payout was not only unnecessary, but an example of censorship by the president and a threat to American democracy\n'Trump knew if he put the pressure on and threatened and just held that they would fold, because there's too much money on the table.'\nRather mentioned how most legal experts said the suit - which had demanded $20billion - was not a strong one.\nHe said 60 Minutes 'followed accepted journalistic practices. Lawyers almost unanimously said the case wouldn\u2019t stand up in court.'\nRather - who was fired by CBS in 2006 after presenting unauthenticated documents in a news report on President George W. Bush's Vietnam War-era service in the National Guard - said he stood by his former colleagues still working at CBS News.\n'I do really think they fought a good fight on this, and they'll continue to fight.\n'The people on 60 Minutes and at CBS News didn\u2019t just take it lying down. They did their best to stop it.'\nHe added that 'Trump is now forcing a whole news organization to pay millions of dollars for doing something protected by the Constitution - which is, of course, free and independent reporting.'\n'Now, you take today's sell-out,' he continued. 'And that's what it was: It was a sell-out to extortion by the President. Who can now say where all this ends?'\n'The people on 60 Minutes and at CBS News didn\u2019t just take it lying down. They did their best to stop it,' Rather said\nRather worked at CBS News for 42 years, 24 of them behind the Evening News desk\nRather was fired by CBS in 2006 after presenting unauthenticated documents in a news report on George W. Bush's Vietnam War-era service in the National Guard\n'If major news organizations continue to kneel before power and stop trying to hold the powerful accountable, then we all lose,' he added, noting that the president has done the same with large law firms and major universities.\nRather - who returned to the CBS News airwaves in April 2024 for the first time since his exit 18 years ago to promote a Netflix documentary about his life - said he expects staff at the network 'to fully double down now on whatever great reporting they're allowed to do.'\nHe concluded by saying that in his more than 60 years as a journalist, he's never seen such a hostile climate.\n'And I know the people at CBS News, and particularly those at 60 Minutes, they'll do their dead level best under these circumstances,' he said.\n'But the question is what this development and the message it sends to us. And that's what I'm trying to concentrate on.'\nRather worked at CBS News for 42 years, 24 of them behind the Evening News desk.\nHe unsuccessfully sued CBS News and its then-parent company, Viacom, in 2007, accusing the network and its ownership of making him a 'scapegoat' in the documents controversy.\nAn appeals court dismissed the lawsuit in 2009, and the New York Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it the following year.\nHe now authors a Substack, which he's written for since 2021."

  "argos_summary": "Jon Stewart's future on 'The Daily Show' is uncertain following Paramount's $16 million settlement with Donald Trump, which Stewart criticized as a capitulation to corporate interests. During a recent press conference, Paramount's co-CEO George Cheeks hinted that no decisions about renewing Stewart's contract, which expires in December, have been made. This comes amid speculation that the company may be restructuring its late-night programming, especially after the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, which was reportedly losing $40 million annually. Stewart has openly condemned the settlement, suggesting it undermines journalistic integrity and reflects a broader trend of corporate fear in the media.",
