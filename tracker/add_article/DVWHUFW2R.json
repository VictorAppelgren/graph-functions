The new monitor will use a Fast TN panel, local dimming, and Black Frame Insertion to reduce motion blur, targeting eSports titles like Counter‑Strike 2 and PUBG. While pricing is unclear, the 750Hz version sold for about $1,115, suggesting the 1,000Hz unit will be even more expensive. The announcement was highlighted at the Peak New Products and Ecological Co‑creation conference and detailed in a white paper released by the companies.",
