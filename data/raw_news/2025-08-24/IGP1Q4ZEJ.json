  "description": "Key PointsBurry and his fund Scion Asset Management turned heads in the first quarter when they nearly sold their entire portfolio.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Burry and his fund Scion Asset Management turned heads in the first quarter when they nearly sold their entire portfolio.\n\u2022 None The move worked out as Burry avoided the massive market sell-off in April.\n\u2022 None Now, Burry and his team are playing contrarian on two names that have gotten crushed this year.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than UnitedHealth Group \u203a\n\nDr. Michael Burry rose to fame for bets he made against the housing market, leading up to the Great Recession, when he purchased credit default swaps on mortgage bonds that paid out big. These events were portrayed in the movie The Big Short in which Oscar-winner Christian Bale portrayed Burry in the critically acclaimed film directed by Adam McKay.\n\nNeedless to say, Burry, who runs Scion Asset Management, turned heads again earlier this year when filings showed that the fund sold nearly its entire portfolio in the first quarter of the year. Burry also bought put options on large tech and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Nvidia. Those moves proved to be prescient because the stock market got absolutely crushed in early April due to President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" although it has since rebounded.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nScion's second quarter 13F filing showed that Burry was a big buyer of stocks in Q2 and seems to have turned bullish. Notably, Burry went long on two stocks that investors have seemingly left for dead and that were down at least 40% this year.\n\nUnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH), the largest healthcare insurer in the U.S., has had a tough year. Even after a strong recovery recently, the stock is still down close to 41% this year (as of Aug. 20). Sectorwide trends, including higher utilization, high prescription costs, and an older population, resulted in management severely underestimating the company's medical costs in 2025, which are now projected to come in $6.5 billion higher than expected.\n\nThis has crippled expected adjusted earnings this year, with management now guiding for $16 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, down from an initial guide of $29.50 to $30 at the beginning of the year . Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating United for its billing practices associated with Medicare Advantage, the private healthcare program that is reimbursed by the government.\n\nWith the stock crushed, hedge funds including Scion swooped in to scoop up shares in Q2. Burry added about 20,000 shares and also purchased 350,000 shares through long call options, which are essentially bets that a stock will rise to or above a certain price by a certain date. Other notable billionaires who bought the dip include Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and Appaloosa Management's David Tepper.\n\nWhile United certainly has its work cut out, being the largest healthcare insurer in the U.S. still gives the company significant pricing power. Financially speaking, UnitedHealth is still doing OK. The company is generating enough earnings from operations to handle its debt payments and still had a free-cash-flow yield over 9% in the past 12 months. The company also has a dividend yield close to 3% to compensate investors for their time. Burry and others are betting United can navigate the choppy waters in the near term and then get back to their strong performance long term.\n\nThe luxury exercise and apparel brand Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU) has seen its stock get absolutely crushed this year and is down close to 47%. Lululemon has been dealing with numerous headwinds, including rising competition, tariffs, a more cautious consumer less willing to shell out for luxury clothes, and a bit of a slowdown in the exercise space as tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic have died down.\n\nBut that didn't stop Burry and Scion from purchasing 50,000 shares of the stock in Q2 and 400,000 total shares through long call options. Lulu's performance hasn't necessarily been bad. In the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 ending May 4, the company reported EPS and revenue both ahead of Wall Street estimates and up on a year-over-year basis.\n\nHowever, management also lowered its full-year EPS guidance to a range of $14.58 to $14.78, down from a range of $14.95 to $15.15 and below what analysts had expected, citing a \"dynamic macroenvironment.\" Lulu's CEO Calvin McDonald also said the company \"intends to leverage our strong financial position and competitive advantages to play offense, while we continue to invest in the growth opportunities in front of us.\"\n\nThe company has $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents and no debt on its balance sheet, and is also planning some modest price increases to mitigate some of the impacts of tariffs. With the stock now trading around 13.5 times forward earnings, Burry is probably thinking that most of the challenges are priced into the stock, and that the firm's strong balance sheet and brand can weather near-term challenges, with a good long-term opportunity ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UnitedHealth Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UnitedHealth Group wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,993!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,057% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nBram Berkowitz has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

  "summary": "Michael Burry, founder of Scion Asset Management, has purchased two companies that have lost at least 40% this year. The purchases were made in the first quarter when Burry nearly sold his entire portfolio, avoiding a major market sell-off. The fund also bought put options on large tech and AI stocks like Nvidia. Burry and his team are now playing contrarian on two names that have been heavily down this year due to sectorwide trends and high prescription costs. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH), the largest healthcare insurer in the US., has had a tough year and is still down close to 41%. The company's medical costs in 2025 are projected to come in $6.5 billion higher than expected. Despite this, Burry remains optimistic about UnitedHealth's ability to recover and maintain its strong performance long term.",

      "text": "Lululemon Athletica (LULU 4.76%) stock has looked very drained and low-energy in recent months. The athletic apparel specialist's share price trades nearly 47% year to date, while the benchmark S&P 500 index is up by almost 10%.\nIt wasn't so long ago that Lululemon was a star in the always tough and highly competitive specialty clothing industry. A closer look at how it started falling from the sky, and whether it's got a chance at regaining altitude, will show the main reason for its drop.\nStiff headwinds\nBasically, Lululemon has struggled to cope with two trends -- rising competition, and the end of the COVID-19 pandemic-era boom in exercise products, services, and apparel.\nWith the many closures and lock-ins of that age, people were often stuck for things to do. Two activities that could be conducted at home with relative safety were working out or doing yoga, hence the rise in demand for athleisurewear. This coincided with the rise of Lululemon as a brand; the company had clothes and accessories that not only looked good but were highly practical for such pursuits.\nExcessive success leads to determined competition, and rivals inevitably piled into the space. At the same time, the company was maturing, a combination that slowed sales growth notably. From a 42% improvement in fiscal 2021, in the three subsequent years, growth withered to 30%, 19%, and finally 10% in 2024.\nTo its credit, Lululemon has been able to consistently land in positive territory on the bottom line. But investors are always hungry for meaningful revenue growth, and when that slows, they often bail.\nOne brand among many\nTo its credit, Lululemon has remained profitable, as it's continued to -- sensibly, in my view -- focus on that combination of product style, durability, and usefulness.\nYet with those determined competitors crowding its space, the company's wares aren't as distinctive as they used to be. Given that, I'd probably be hesitant to buy the stock for its growth potential until the company figures out how to better distinguish itself in the market again."

      "text": "What is it?\nWhat is Earnings Per Share (EPS)?\nEarnings per share (EPS) is a metric investors commonly use to value a stock or company because it indicates the profitability of a company on a per-share basis. EPS is calculated by subtracting any preferred dividends from a company's net income and dividing that amount by the number of shares outstanding. Net income is the amount of money that remains in a reporting period after all cash and non-cash expenses are deducted, and net income minus preferred dividends is synonymous with a company's profit for the period. Preferred dividends must be subtracted because holders of preferred stock have contractual rights to dividend payouts. Read on to find out more about earnings per share -- calculating them, understanding how to use them, and the difference between different ways to look at this important metric.\nA company reports its EPS in consolidated statements of operations (income statements) in both annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) SEC filings. Considering a company's earnings as its profit, the company can either distribute that money to shareholders or reinvest it in the company.\nIt's useful to know how to calculate EPS yourself for a few different reasons.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate earnings per share (EPS)\nLet's walk through an example EPS calculation using Netflix (NFLX -0.2%). For its most recent fiscal year, the company reported a net income of $4,491,924,000 and total shares outstanding of 444,698,000. The company's balance sheet indicates Netflix has not issued any preferred stock, so we don't need to subtract preferred dividends. Dividing $4,491,924,000 into 444,698,000 produces an EPS value of $10.10.\nNet Income\nLimitations\nLimitations of EPS\nThe main limitation of using EPS to value a stock or company is that EPS is calculated using net income. Non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization are subtracted from net income, and the lumpy nature of capital expenditures can cause a company's net income to vary greatly across reporting periods. Businesses can have many different non-operating expenses, such as tax and interest payments, which affect net income. A company's net income doesn't accurately reflect its cash flow or the health of its business.\nAdditionally, companies can and do manipulate their EPS numbers by changing the number of shares outstanding. Share issuances, splits, and stock buybacks all change the denominator by which net income less preferred dividends is divided.\nEPS numbers are most useful when evaluated along with other metrics. The two most common are the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company's stock price to its EPS, and the return on equity (ROE), which indicates the amount of profit a company generates from its net assets.\nDividends Per Share\nBasic vs. diluted EPS\nBasic EPS vs. diluted EPS\nDiluted EPS numbers, unlike the \"basic\" EPS metric described above, account for all potential shares outstanding. Financial instruments like convertible debt and employee stock options, which are often used to raise capital and motivate employees, must be added to the outstanding share count to calculate a company's diluted EPS.\nLet's calculate the diluted EPS for Netflix. The company has granted 6,592,000 stock options to employees, which raises the total outstanding share count to 451,290,000. Dividing the same $4,491,924,000 of net income into 451,290,000 equals an EPS value of $9.95.\nValuation models use fully diluted EPS because it is more conservative. Share counts tend to increase, especially for fast-growing companies that leverage their abilities to issue more shares in order to expand.\nDifferences\nWhat is the difference between EPS and adjusted EPS?\nCompanies often report EPS values using net income numbers that are adjusted for one-time profits and expenses, like sales of business units or losses from natural disasters. Although a company's adjusted EPS can be a more accurate indicator of the company's performance, some companies aggressively \"adjust\" their net incomes in misleading or even fraudulent ways to boost their adjusted EPS numbers.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat is a good EPS?\nWhat is a good EPS?\nA good EPS is determined less by the absolute value of the EPS and more by its year-over-year change. The absolute value of a company's EPS should increase annually, but the rate of increase of EPS should also accelerate.\nA company's EPS can vary based on fluctuations in earnings, total number of shares outstanding, or both. A company can boost its EPS by increasing its earnings or reducing its share count through share buybacks, but a company that increases its outstanding share count faster than its earnings will cause its EPS to drop.\nStock investors can further evaluate a company's EPS by considering it in conjunction with its P/E ratio and determining how the company's share price is fluctuating relative to its earnings."

      "text": "UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.24%) has been a staple in the healthcare world for decades and is one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap of around $280 billion as of Aug. 18. Unfortunately, the company was much more valuable before a recent string of events sent the stock plummeting.\nHad you invested $1,000 into UnitedHealth Group stock three years ago (using Aug. 18, 2022, as the starting point), your investment would only be worth just over $572 today, or $585 when including dividends.\nUnitedHealth Group has been in the news for all the wrong reasons\nUnitedHealth Group's stock is down around 42% over the past three years, but much of that fall has come this year, with the stock down over 38% year to date. There hasn't been a single event that caused this drop, but rather a few problems that have seemed to compound.\nTo begin, the company's then-CEO, Brian Thompson, was killed in December 2024, and the alleged shooter's manifesto brought scrutiny to some of the company's business practices. Then, in May of this year, then-CEO Andrew Witty resigned, citing personal reasons. This latter departure came as UnitedHealth Group suspended its forecast for the year, and the stock dropped 18% in a single day, hitting a four-year low.\nThe recent slump is far from ideal for investors who've held the stock over that span. But there might be light at the end of the tunnel. In the most recent 13F filing from Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, Berkshire disclosed that it added over 5 million shares of UnitedHealth Group. The news led to UnitedHealth Group's stock price having its best single-day gain since March 2020, and it rose over 23% from Aug. 12 to Aug. 18.\nWhether that leads to a longer-term turnaround remains to be seen. But it has undoubtedly brought more optimism into the picture for UnitedHealth."

      "text": "Each quarter, investors anxiously await Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway filing its 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, divulging what stocks Berkshire held at the end of the quarter, and, therefore, what stocks the company bought and sold in any given quarter. Investors are always looking for a glimpse into the genius of Buffett and his team of investors, especially with Buffett set to step down as CEO of the company at the end of the year.\nWhile Berkshire has been quiet in recent quarters, the large conglomerate made some notable moves in the second quarter. Berkshire recently sold some shares in two of its largest positions, while piling into an embattled healthcare stock that has struggled immensely this year.\nTrimming Apple and Bank of America\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire continued to trim its largest position, Apple (AAPL 1.21%), and its third-largest holding, Bank of America (BAC 2.55%). In the quarter, Berkshire sold 7% of its stake in Apple and 4% of its stake in Bank of America. Over the past year, Berkshire has reduced its stake in Apple by 30% and Bank of America by 41%.\nWhile the bull market has raged for more than 2.5 years, Berkshire has plodded along conservatively, hoarding hundreds of billions of dollars in cash and cash equivalents, selling more stocks than it buys, and even turning away from share repurchases more recently. Given stretched valuations and the stock market's big run, many investors simply think Buffett and his team are not seeing compelling opportunities.\nThere's also talk that Berkshire is staying conservative to prepare for the big transition that will see Buffett step down as CEO but retain his role as chairman of the board of directors. Longtime Berkshire veteran Greg Abel is set to step into Buffett's big shoes. Berkshire's stock got off to a terrific start this year but has floundered since the transition was announced.\nApple has been dealing with tariff-related issues all year. Buffett and Berkshire may have foreseen this once President Donald Trump won the election, leading them to pare back their position. If Berkshire is concerned about the economy, perhaps paring back some of their bank holdings makes sense as well, as banks are typically cyclical.\nPlaying contrarian on this healthcare giant\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire initiated a $1.57 billion position in the nation's largest healthcare insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.24%). UnitedHealth's stock has been crushed this year and is down about 46%. However, after the news came out about Berkshire buying the stock, shares increased close to 9.5% in after-hours trading.\nUnitedHealth has dealt with a flurry of issues this year, including higher medical insurance costs, which is a common trend across the sector. In the second quarter, management at UnitedHealth revised its prior full-year outlook down to $16 adjusted earnings per share, significantly below Wall Street's consensus estimates coming into the year.\nThe main culprit is medical costs, which management thinks will come in $6.5 billion higher than previously expected. The sector has struggled in the face of an aging population, higher utilization of and more expensive services, higher drug prices, and inflation.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing UnitedHealth in a criminal investigation over the way it charges customers in its Medicare Advantage program. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported on suspicious billing practices that allegedly increase payouts to the company. In a statement in late July, UnitedHealth said it is cooperating with the DOJ but has \"full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process.\"\nAt their core, Buffett and his team are value investors, meaning they look for stocks with a market value below a company's perceived intrinsic value. While UnitedHealth has struggled and is forecasting a significant earnings decline this year, management is still projecting double-digit revenue growth in 2025. Furthermore, the company's balance sheet seems to be on solid footing. Sure, the company has high debt, but through the first six months of the year, earnings from operations of about $14.3 billion are still more than 7 times debt interest expense.\nAdditionally, UnitedHealth's dividend yield is now roughly 3.25%, while the company's trailing free-cash-flow yield is above 10%, showing the company can easily cover the dividend for the foreseeable future. In fact, UnitedHealth recently increased its quarterly dividend by 5%.\nUltimately, UnitedHealth trades at a lower-than-usual forward price-to-earnings ratio, despite expectations of much lower earnings this year, and at less than 1 times revenue. Buffett and his team value strong moats, so with UnitedHealth still controlling market share in the healthcare insurance industry, they likely see an attractive risk-reward proposition."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

UnitedHealth, down about 42% YTD, faces higher medical costs, a DOJ probe, and a revised earnings outlook, yet maintains a strong balance sheet and dividend yield that Burry and other investors view as a long\u2011term upside. Lululemon, also down nearly 47%, has a solid cash position and positive earnings but has cut guidance amid rising competition and a post\u2011COVID slowdown, prompting Burry\u2019s cautious buy. Both stocks are seen as undervalued opportunities for investors willing to weather short\u2011term volatility for potential long\u2011term gains.",
