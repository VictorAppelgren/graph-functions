  "title": "Four new driving rules set to affect over 70s including new eye test rule",
  "description": "Labour is looking into a major overhaul of UK motoring rules with new eye checks, drink-driving limits and tough seatbelt penalties among the updates.",
  "content": "Four new driving rules are set to come into force across the UK as part of a major Labour crackdown in motoring. The headline announcement for over 70s is the introduction of new eyesight testing rules to monitor the safety of elderly road users. However, three new announcements affecting everything from alcohol drink-drive limits to seatbelt rules and insured drivers were also listed. These will affect all road users regardless of their age, but over 70s are set to also feel the impact of the updates. Express.co.uk looks at what is set to change in one of the biggest motoring overhauls in years.\n\nThis is the big one for elderly drivers with new mandatory eyesight rules looking set to be introduced. The UK is only one of three European countries to rely on motorists self-reporting any issues when renewing their driving licence. Although details have not been fleshed out, the rule means older individuals may be required to sit through an eye test every three years. Optometrists who notice any visual impairments should then notify the DVLA, with motorists likely to have a new licence blocked.\n\nOfficials are understood to be considering a drastic reduction to the drink-drive limits in England and Wales, bringing the policy into line with Scotland and the rest of Europe. The current cut-off sits at 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath but this could be slashed to just 22 micrograms. New roadside saliva tests could also be rolled out as evidence, helping police prosecute drivers by the side of the road instead of having to wait for a blood test.\n\nMotorists caught not wearing a seatbelt are already set to face a \u00a3100 bill with penalties rising to \u00a3500 in extreme cases. But under the current rules, motorists are not issued any penalty points on their driving licence for the simple offence. This looks likely to change with plans to issue points as well as financial penalties to road users in a hefty blow.",
