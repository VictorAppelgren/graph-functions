      "feedback": "Strong start tying Cadillac’s Elevated Velocity to a domestic EV/auto‑capex pulse, but to reach world‑class you need a tight, testable scenario map with explicit catalysts, time windows, and invalidations anchored in the five sources. Actions: (1) Build the causal chain explicitly: policy/tariffs (25% on vehicles and parts) and the Big Bill/Medicaid shifts affect demand and financing costs; GM’s $4B U.S. manufacturing push and capacity to “assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year” with 10–12B of capex through 2027 underpin a mid‑term EV cadence; the Cadillac concept signals product/branding leverage (LYRIQ‑V/OPTIQ‑V, Terra mode, Sand Vision) that could lift margins if output scales; (2) codify 3–6 month catalysts and timing: Cadillac Elevated Velocity preview as a near‑term sentiment/brand signal; Deutsche Bank/April–May pre‑buy demand cushioning pricing; GM capex/production ramp milestones; tariff stabilization or escalation as a market inflection; dealer AI tools pricing/responding to tariffs as a currency for demand resilience; (3) add two concrete alt paths with triggers and invalidate criteria: Alt 1 (tariffs escalate): price inflation/volume pullback unless pass‑through is absorbed by demand; Alt 2 (policy compromise): debt/tax reform easing rate risk and sustaining autos CAPEX/throughput; invalidate if tariff relief or capex delays occur; (4) quantify with discipline: cite GM capex range ($10–$12B through 2027) and the >2M US vehicles/year capacity; cite Elevated Velocity features as signaling the premium end of the segment; cite pre‑buy demand as a near‑term positive impulse; Pacaso/Range–AI productivity pieces can be treated as longer‑horizon optional signals for productivity/risk premia skews (UPV3X2MQ6); (5) tighten sourcing and reconciliation: clearly attribute Cadillac/GM signals to WTNT85IPR, policy/RNC dynamics to EPJYXB7DX, and the Pacaso/AI/real‑estate growth angles to UPV3X2MQ6, avoiding any non‑ID sources; (6) convert to a clean base case plus 2 alts with named watch signals: base case 3–6 months with GM capex ramp and tariff stability; alt 1 tariff shock; alt 2 policy‑stabilized but debt/deficit risk remains; (7) sharpen the write‑up language to remove speculative price targets and replace them with scenario‑driven ranges (e.g., demand trajectory, capex spend, and production milestones) and end with a concise watchlist: GM/EV milestones, Cadillac/V‑Series cadence, tariff announcements, Medicaid/OBBBA progress, Pacaso international expansion, Range/AI productivity signals; (8) keep the horizon format: end 3–6 months with base, 1–2 alternates, explicit risks and watch signals, plus confidence—citing WTNT85IPR for auto/EV catalysts, EPJYXB7DX for policy/political risk, and UPV3X2MQ6 for growth/alternative investments.",
