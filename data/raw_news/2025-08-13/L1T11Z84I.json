  "title": "Melissa McCarthy, husband Ben Falcone bring comedy to date night with 'Ghost' recreation",
  "description": "Melissa McCarthy and husband Ben Falcone recreated an iconic scene from the 1990 movie \"Ghost.\"",
  "content": "Melissa McCarthy may be a comedy legend, but she's got plenty of dramatic flair, too.\n\nMcCarthy took to Instagram over the weekend to let followers in on an intimate date night with longtime husband (and fellow comic) Ben Falcone. In a carousel of photos posted Aug. 9, McCarthy showed off some homemade pottery she had crafted at Wild Clay, a studio just east of Los Angeles.\n\nThe first several photos show the \"Bridesmaids\" star holding up her hands covered in clay, and posing with several of her projects, but the final shot is the most true to form \u2013 McCarthy, 54, and Falcone, 51, look comically serious as they recreate an iconic scene from the 1990 movie \"Ghost.\"\n\nMcCarthy looks wistfully to the side as Falcone, seated behind her, has his hands overlaced with hers and looks straight into the camera. In the middle of them is the pottery wheel, the site of a sensual scene between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze in the original film.\n\n\"We had the BEST time at Wild Clay LA!!!!!!!,\" McCarthy wrote alongside the post. \"Joshua was an amazing teacher. I really found my inner Demi!! Grand Opening Soon!!\"\n\nThe couple, who love to ham it up together, have been married since 2005 and share two daughters: Vivian, 18, and Georgette, 15.\n\n\"He's nothing but supportive, and he's super smart,\" McCarthy previously told People of her husband. \"He makes me gut-laugh, like crazy gut-laugh, four or five times a day. I hit the jackpot!\"\n\nThe couple has also shared the screen over a dozen times, starring alongside one another in films like \"Bridesmaids,\" \"Cook Off!\" and \"Identity Thief.\"",

People Editorial Guidelines Published on February 26, 2020 02:00PM EST It\u2019s been more than two decades since Melissa McCarthy first met Ben Falcone in comedy school, but the movie star says her husband still makes her giddy. \u201cIt\u2019s [about] finding someone who you just absolutely are better with. He\u2019s nothing but supportive, and he\u2019s super smart,\u201d McCarthy tells PEOPLE about her actor-director husband in this week\u2019s cover story. \u201cHe makes me gut-laugh, like crazy gut-laugh, four or five times a day. I hit the jackpot!\u201d Noting that Falcone, 46, \u201cleads with nothing but kindness,\u201d McCarthy, 49, is also thankful for his strong presence in their daughters\u2019 lives. Joshua Blanchard/Getty \u201cI just think if they ever meet somebody and that little red flag goes off, the bell is gonna sound even louder because they have Ben as their baseline,\u201d says McCarthy, who\u2019s mom to Vivian, 12, and Georgette, 10, with Falcone. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna pick well, whoever they end up with, you know?

      "text": "'I cry at the drop of a hat': Melissa McCarthy tackles tragedy in Netflix's 'The Starling'\nMelissa McCarthy refuses to choose comedy or tragedy in her movies. She wants it all, and a nice balance of both really hits the spot.\n\u201cI don't love when characters are just all serious all the time or when someone's goofy all the time. I don't know how to do a comedy without pathos,\u201d McCarthy says. \"You have to really let a character fall and fail for you to root for them to get up.\"\nMcCarthy\u2019s latest film is definitely one of those wide-ranging emotional roles: In the Netflix dramedy \u201cThe Starling\u201d (streaming Friday), her character Lilly is still coming to grips with the sudden death of her infant daughter while also trying to maintain a connection with husband Jack (Chris O\u2019Dowd), who goes to a mental health facility in the aftermath of the loss. Lilly struggles at work and also at home, where a pesky black bird constantly dive-bombs her when she tends to her garden until she meets a veterinarian (Kevin Kline) who helps get her back on track.\nRanked: All the best movies we saw at Toronto Film Festival (including 'Dune' and 'The Starling')\n\u201cI love and understood that feeling of somebody's got to keep it going,\u201d McCarthy, 51, says of Lilly. \u201cI have two kids (daughters Vivian, 14, and Georgette, 11) and there is always that feeling of when tough times come, it's like, \u2018No, no, no, you don't get to have this moment. Someone has to keep it together.\u2019 You do that out of love and out of necessity and out of fear of if you do fall apart, will you ever put it back together?\u201d\nMcCarthy, who recently spent time in Australia filming Hulu\u2019s \u201cNine Perfect Strangers\u201d as well as Netflix\u2019s upcoming comedy \u201cGod\u2019s Favorite Idiot\u201d with her husband/filmmaker/frequent co-star Ben Falcone, checks in via Zoom to discuss \u201cThe Starling,\u201d a childhood encounter with wildlife and playing the infamous Ursula in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d (in theaters May 26, 2023).\n'Nine Perfect Strangers': Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy talk new Hulu series\nQuestion: Lilly goes to war with this little bird before coming to care for it. Have you ever had a similar run-in with a critter?\nMelissa McCarthy: I grew up on a corn and soybean farm in Illinois and we had literally 35 cats outside. We did have one cat that later we were told had epilepsy and instead of a seizure, it reacted (aggressively). Its name was Sweetness \u2013 the irony \u2013 and it was OK as long as you were petting it. But if you went to walk away, it would start that like \"Rrrrrrrr\" and you knew you were in trouble. I was probably in third grade and I was like, I won't engage it because usually if you didn't engage it, it was OK. It was truly like a cartoon: It went around me, all the way up, all over my head, back down to my feet. By the time I saw my dad and one of the farmers running toward me, it had two full passes on me. So I have danced with some wildlife.\nQ: Being a mom yourself, did that aspect of Lilly's story touch you in a very real way?\nMcCarthy: Absolutely. It's having to not only think about but really make the commitment to live with the unimaginable for a long duration of time. You have to go to places that are very uncomfortable and I would also have to monitor how much she doesn't show it. I am not a stoic person. I don't have a great poker face in my real life. I cry at the drop of a hat. So to play someone that is going through this grief and loss but is choosing not to show it was a really unusual challenge.\nQ: Do your kids have a favorite movie with you and Ben?\nMcCarthy: I don't know. They've not seen all of them. They're getting to that point now where they can, but I always feel creepy being like, \"Do you want to watch one of our movies?\" They really enjoyed \"Thunder Force,\" our last one, because that one was PG, but I'm about to let them see all of them, so we'll see. They've seen parts of everything.\nOur youngest never could see me being hurt. It was sweet. All of the stunts that I'm like, \"I worked so hard on that!\" \u2013 it was very upsetting for her. And now she's like, \"I get it, it's a stunt.\" I'm like, \"OK, Ironsides.\"\nQ: So you falling off a ladder in \u201cThe Starling,\" that's totally fine?\nMcCarthy: Yeah, now she doesn't care at all. That one actually hurt. She's like, \u201cWell, you signed up for it.\u201d She's grizzled.\nQ: How was being a villainous sea witch in the new \"Little Mermaid\"?\nMcCarthy: Glorious. The world of Disney and (director) Rob Marshall is a world that I wish everyone could experience because it's so creative, kind and lovely. Going to singing class every day, I was actually sad: I got to record with an orchestra, which is a mind-bender for someone who is not a singer, and then they were like, \u201cThat's it, we've got your song.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWait, I don't get to go to class anymore?\u201d I was actually kind of heartbroken about it, but it was such a fun process. It's going to be incredible.\nQ: Was a musical on your Hollywood bucket list?\nMcCarthy: No, because I didn't think anybody would let me. I love to dance, I love music, I love musicals, but I was like, \u201cWell, I'm not trained in that, so I don't get to do that.\u201d To me, Ursula is everything. She's one of my absolute favorite villains so to play her was delicious.\nYou're flying around singing and spinning in these crazy contraptions and up on wires. What's not to love? Nobody else lets me spin around the yard and sing. They would be like, \u201cYou're going to have to stop that.\u201d"

She called his pancreatic cancer battle \"like living in a complete nightmare,\" although the pair \"kept positive about everything.\"\nShe remarried DePrisco, she said, after Swayze gave her permission in a dream to tie the knot again, saying she and Swayze \"still have a relationship\" every day.\n\"It was like he was resurrected,\" she said. \"And I was in this courtyard \u2014 and he came out and when I see him in my dreams, he can never speak, but I can understand what he was saying ... and he came up to me and he put his arms around me, and I was like, 'I can't marry Albert because you're back.

Niemi, who said the dream was like giving a \"blessing,\" added that some fans gave her \"flak\" and \"criticism\" for her choice to marry DePrisco, calling it \"ridiculous.\"\n\"It didn't affect my love for Patrick one bit,\" Niemi said, before adding that DePrisco said when proposing, \"I know you love him and I know you love me, and I'm here to love you now.\"\n\"I was so tempted so many times to say, 'Hey girlfriend, stand in my shoes, tell me about it! Go ahead, tell me just because I lost my husband that I don't love him anymore,'\" Niemi added.\nThis isn't the first time in recent years that Niemi has opened up about the loss. She reflected on missing and mourning him, in a video interview published in 2022.\n\"I don't think there's anything I don't miss about him,\" Niemi told ET at the time. \"It's also the little things. It's his laugh. It's the sound of his voice. I feel like he's with me every day. We had a great ride and there's so much to be grateful for.\""

      "text": "Barbra Streisand, Melissa McCarthy and the problem with asking about Ozempic, weight loss\nIt was the Instagram comment you couldn't help but cringe at. Barbra Streisand wrote on a recent Melissa McCarthy Instagram post: \"Give him my regards did you take Ozempic?\"\nQuestions may have swirled in your mind: Is it a mistake? Is it a genuine question? Is it insensitive? Is it OK to ask someone if they're on weight loss drugs, like Ozempic? Both stars have since spoken out.\n\"OMG - I went on Instagram to see the photos we'd posted of the beautiful flowers I'd received for my birthday! Below them was a photo of my friend Melissa McCarthy who I sang with on my Encore album. She looked fantastic!\" Steisand wrote on X on Tuesday. \"I just wanted to pay her a compliment. I forgot the world is reading!\" McCarthy followed up in an Instagram video: \"The takeaway: Barbra Streisand knows I exist, she reached out to me and she thought I looked good! I win the day.\"\nStill, experts say that those curious about someone's weight loss \u2013 no matter how well-meaning they may be \u2013 should tread carefully, and in some cases not ask at all.\n\"Talking about appearance and asking questions about someone's weight has become so normalized in our society that we don't even think about the effects these have on the person being asked,\" says Elizabet Altunkara, director of education at the National Eating Disorders Association. \"Asking about someone's weight or making comments about their appearance perpetuates toxic diet culture and can harm people with body image issues, disordered eating or an eating disorder.\"\nHmm: Oprah Winfrey's revelation about using weight loss drugs is a game changer. Here's why.\n'Medical issues are private'\nYou're not a bad person if you want to know how someone loses weight. It's common to ask, \"partly out of curiosity, and partly because others may want to follow their lead and get some tips on weight loss,\" says Deborah Carr, director of the Center of Innovation in Social Science at Boston University and a professor of sociology. \"In this case, however, Melissa wasn\u2019t posting about her weight loss; she was sharing a photo of herself in a beautiful pastel dress, on her way to honor her friend at a gala.\" The focus on McCarthy's body reflects a larger societal issue, where people, women especially, with fuller figures receive attention for that more than anything else.\n\"It is always inappropriate to ask someone about whether or not they are on medications to treat obesity,\" says Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \"We never ask patients if they\u2019re on medication\u2019s to treat depression, diabetes, hypertension and the list goes on. We feel that it is within our purview to ask people about whether or not there are medications to treat obesity because obesity is a disease that you wear.\"\nKeep in mind, too, \"that someone\u2019s medical issues are private and should be not be commented upon publicly or privately,\" adds Dr. Melanie Jay, associate professor in the Department of Medicine at New York University Langone Health.\nAsking about Ozempic specifically could be seen as judgmental. \"There\u2019s the pervasive and problematic belief that those who have larger body sizes lack self-control or discipline and overeat,\" Carr adds. \"The flip side is that people who lose weight through medication rather than diet or exercise are believed to be 'taking shortcuts' and 'not doing the work.'\"\nMore on this topic: Josh Peck\u2019s drug, alcohol use after weight loss sparks talk about 'addiction transfer'\nHow to talk about Ozempic, weight loss\nCarr recommends people stop judging others' bodies and how they lost weight. But if you do want to ask someone about their journey, give them context: \"Perhaps mention that we\u2019re interested in losing weight, and we thought they might have some tips given their own recent weight loss. It\u2019s also important to ask about their other health tips \u2013 which they may surely have \u2013 so that we\u2019re not reducing a person\u2019s existence to the single indicator of their body weight.\"\nJay suggests saving these conversations for close friends or family who are open to sharing information about weight loss drugs. Cody Stanford adds: \"Unless someone directly tells you this information, it is really none of our business. If someone is curious about strategies to address weight, and you would like to ask a friend or family member, you might consider approaching them with your own struggles. You might explain how you have had difficulty and would like to learn more about what strategies one could take to address the chronic disease of obesity.\"\nAnd remember to double check before you post anything online.\nContributing: KiMI Robinson"

      "text": "Melissa McCarthy reveals the 'Little Mermaid' switch that 'changed the game' for Ursula\nMelissa McCarthy knew she had big tentacles to fill portraying villainous Ursula for the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d\nMcCarthy fell hard for the outrageously coiffed, half-octopus sea witch of the 1989 Disney animated original while working as a nanny for two VHS-obsessed children.\n\"I've seen 'The Little Mermaid' more than any other movie, hundreds of times. We literally watched it every night,\" says McCarthy, 52. \"I've always thought Ursula was the dishiest, most incredible part.\"\nPlaying the dream role in the remake (in theaters Friday) alongside Halle Bailey's mermaid Ariel proved doubly challenging for two-time Oscar nominee McCarthy - not only pulling off a convincingly conniving performance featuring Ursula's big song, \"Poor Unfortunate Souls,\" but inevitably inviting comparisons to her beloved original animated Ursula, voiced by Pat Carroll.\n\"My hope was to give all the love I have for Pat Carroll's original,\" says McCarthy. \"And then put my own spin on it.\"\nHere's how McCarthy spun her Ursula in \"The Little Mermaid\":\nPrince Eric is the best Disney prince: Here's why we love the underrated 'Little Mermaid' hero.\nMelissa McCarthy proved she had the vocal chops for 'Poor Unfortunate Souls'\nPortraying Disney's new Ursula \u2212 who tricks Ariel into giving up her golden voice for human legs and feet to pursue her true love, Prince Eric \u2212 proved to be one of the hottest casting stories in Hollywood. Even Lizzo threw her blond Ursula wig in the ring in 2018, dressing in a full ensemble and belting \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" in a social media video. McCarthy implored director Rob Marshall in what she was sure was a futile effort.\n\"I told him, 'I'm probably not even on the bottom of your list. But I would love to talk to you about it, please, because I feel this Ursula connection,' \" says McCarthy.\nOver lunch, Marshall told McCarthy he was already aware of her singing chops from Barbra Streisand's 2016 album \"Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway,\" which features the unlikely duo singing \"Anything You Can Do.\"\nThe Streisand song helped. \"But I didn't really know to what extent Melissa could sing,\" says Marshall. \"I was thrilled to see that she literally has this massive voice with so many colors. And she's fearless.\"\n\"We just clicked as friends and collaborators,\" McCarthy says of Marshall.\nEven Lizzo came around on the casting after meeting McCarthy at the taping of Adele\u2019s \u201cOne Night Only\u201d concert special and bonding over their shared love for Ursula. \"I'm definitely watching 'Little Mermaid' this weekend,\" Lizzo told USA TODAY.\nUrsula and King Triton are siblings in new 'Little Mermaid': Why that 'changed the game'\nMcCarthy has had decades to consider, and sympathize with, Ursula's plight. Sure, she fools innocent Ariel, and the sea witch is a scourge to King Triton (Javier Bardem). But she's got her reasons. After all, Ursula lives alone at the sea's bottom with only two eel henchmen, Flotsam and Jetsam.\n\"She's categorized as the villain, but I have a complicated view of Ursula. She's misunderstood, damaged,\" says McCarthy, who became more Ursula-compassionate during the COVID-19 pandemic that interrupted filming. \"Coming out of lockdown to play someone who is not at 100% mental health because of her isolation \u2212 we can all relate to that.\"\nTo boot, there's a new twist to Ursula's dastardly power move to dethrone King Triton and become Queen of Atlantica. In the new version, the two characters are related. So Triton kicked his own sister from the kingdom.\n\"To know that your family banished you and sent you into exile, that changed the game for me,\" says McCarthy. \"The very people she wants to love have thrown her aside. Even if she deserved it, she's missed out on her whole life.\"\nEmpathy only goes so far, however, as McCarthy brings delicious badness to Ursula. She capped the performance by singing \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" with a 200-piece orchestra. \"That's as terrifying as singing with Barbra Streisand,\" says McCarthy.\nMelissa McCarthy gave up her Ursula wig, learned to swim like 'a creature who lives in the water'\nThe underwater \"Little Mermaid\" scenes were shot in a studio against a blue screen that required McCarthy to be strapped into rigs to simulate effortless water movement. The water and special effects, like Ursula's hair and tentacles, were added digitally through computer graphics. But the levitating movements were very real.\n\"I had to go to 'swim school' because Rob really wanted it to appear that you're not swimming, but sort of floating like a creature who lives in the water,\" says McCarthy, who perfected her water \"slither\" for Ursula. \"I've never seen that kind of beautiful, nonsymmetrical underwater movement in a movie.\"\nShooting with blue-screen technology meant that McCarthy had to wear a skull cap rather than Ursula's famed white hair. This was \"at first, traumatic\" for McCarthy, who had grown to love the Ursula wig she had worn since a transformative camera test.\n\"Once I had put that wig on, it felt like 'Oh, darling,' like everything made sense with Ursula,\" says McCarthy. \"I had quite a few conversations with Rob, asking, 'Can I wear the wig anyway?' \"\nRequest denied. But McCarthy was able to lean into Ursula's elaborate makeup, which took more than an hour each day to apply, and her gloriously dark aubergine fingernails.\n\"I can't imagine finding my Ursula without that makeup, it's the armor she puts on to show the world,\" says McCarthy.\nThe corset dress with iridescent tendrils popping from the collar was the crowning piece. McCarthy worked with costume designer Colleen Atwood to ensure maximum flexibility for the water scenes. \"Colleen designed a corset that still allowed me to slither,\" says McCarthy.\nSeeing the final performance after all the laborious computer-generated image additions \u2212 from Ursula's tentacles to her fabulous hair \u2212 was breathtaking.\n\"Every single hair was drawn and manipulated through a series of computer movements. It just looked incredible,\" says McCarthy, who fully understood the no-wig edict when she saw Ursula's marvelous mane on screen. \"It was like, 'I get it! I really get it.' \"\nDive deep into 'The Little Mermaid':\nNew 'Little Mermaid': What's the same, what's different in Disney's remake?\nRanked: Every Disney live-action remake (including 'The Little Mermaid')\nHalle Bailey: 'Little Mermaid' star pushed herself 'past what I thought I could ever do'\nReview: Halle Bailey keeps Disney's 'Little Mermaid' remake from drowning\n'We almost lost it': 'Little Mermaid' composer recalls fight for 'Part of Your World'"

      "text": "'Life of the Party' star Melissa McCarthy set own standards for equal pay: 'I haven't changed'\nMelissa McCarthy may be the Life of the Party in theaters this weekend, but at home, she\u2019s a contending master baker.\nOn a recent Saturday morning, the actress is three hours into baking 11-year-old Vivian's three-tiered birthday cake, requested to be \"carrot cake on the bottom,\" followed by layers of strawberry cake and Funfetti.\nOutrageous cakes have become a new tradition in the McCarthy/Falcone home. Daughters Vivian and Georgette, 8, \u201cmake it more and more elaborate each year. Last year (Vivian) said, 'I want a three-dimensional shark jumping out of the ocean. And the beach,' \" McCarthy laughs. (Yes, this household is obsessed with The Great British Baking Show.)\nIn Life of the Party (in theaters Friday), directed by husband Ben Falcone, McCarthy\u2019s focus is more academic. The actress plays Deanna, a homemaker unceremoniously dumped by her cheating husband on drop-off day of their daughter\u2019s senior year of college. Picking herself off the floor, Deanna decides to enroll at the university to finish the archaeology degree she left behind at 21.\n\u201cI actually really do want to go back to school someday,\u201d says McCarthy, 47, who moved to New York in her early 20s to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology. But \u201con the second night in New York I did stand-up, and I called my parents and said, 'I\u2019m not going back to school and I\u2019m going to do the rock-solid business of stand-up comedy.' \u201d\nWhat would she study now? McCarthy, who established her own fashion line, Melissa McCarthy Seven7, in 2015 (to be relaunched soon), says she \u201cwould want to take a bunch of math classes. I always enjoyed math, but I never got to see how far I could go.\u201d\nMcCarthy is serious about the numbers. Years before Time\u2019s Up started demanding equal pay for women in Hollywood, the actress was setting her own standards for parity.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never acted any differently. I\u2019ve always been aware of, \u2018Well, what\u2019s everyone getting?' If we\u2019re all getting 75 cents to do the same work, great! I\u2019ll take the 75 cents. If someone\u2019s getting $900 \u2026 I haven\u2019t changed. Maybe that\u2019s why it took me so long to start working,\u201d she laughs. Regardless of the gender dynamics, \u201cI just always thought, 'Well, is it fair?' \u201d\nPart of that strategy is knowing when to call the whole thing off. \u201cI think the biggest negotiating tool is to be like, 'OK, well, I think I\u2019m ready to walk away, no hard feelings,' \u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s working: McCarthy\u2019s schedule is rollicking. In a week, she\u2019ll start filming the Mob drama The Kitchen with Elisabeth Moss and Tiffany Haddish, and in 2018 alone she\u2019s releasing two more films: the graphic puppet comedy The Happytime Murders (out Aug. 17) and the awards-friendly biopic Can You Ever Forgive Me? (Oct. 19), in which she plays author-turned-forger Lee Israel.\nMcCarthy has been putting ballsy, imperfect women onscreen with deliberation since she took off in 2011\u2019s Bridesmaids, from 2014\u2019s Tammy to 2016\u2019s The Boss. \u201cWhat I loved about (Life of the Party) was being able to show a mom-and-daughter relationship where they weren\u2019t at each other\u2019s throats,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just don\u2019t see that that much.\u201d\nBut right now, in her kitchen, the party is Mary Berry-themed. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, a 35-pound cake at this point,\u201d she jokes, heading back to her homemade marshmallow fondant. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to cut out jubilant clouds and a sun on top of it.\u201d"

      "text": "Meryl Streep, Melissa McCarthy shock 'Only Murders' co-stars, ditch stunt doubles for brawl\nTuesday\u2019s \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d saw its podcasting protagonists on the move, a fight between Meryl Streep and Melissa McCarthy's characters, for which the actresses ditched their stunt doubles, and a even a marriage proposal. With so much going on, we'll dive right in like Oliver (Martin Short) when he sees a dip!\nTo escape this season\u2019s killer and their prying hidden cameras, Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver and Mabel (Selena Gomez) flee the Upper West Side\u2019s Arconia apartment building in the seventh episode (now streaming on Hulu) and head for Charles\u2019 estranged sister\u2019s house on Long Island.\nDoreen (McCarthy) is an absolute treasure with her frosted pixie hairstyle, hoop earrings and shimmering mauve lip gloss. She also gives new meaning to the phrase \"all dolled up\": Her house resembles a life-sized home for her sprawling collection of dolls of all sizes \u2212 on the bookshelves, fireplace mantel and even seated on the sofa beside her guests.\n\u2018Menendez Brothers\u2019 documentary: After Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u2018Monsters\u2019 Erik, Lyle have their say\nOne in particular might catch the eye of Swifties whom Taylor Swift has trained to hunt for Easter eggs. In one scene, Mabel shares a sofa with a blond, life-size doll resembling Swift who sports a shirt bearing 87, the number Swift\u2019s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, wears when setting records for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs.\n\u201cThat's a complete coincidence,\u201d Gomez says in an interview, adding that she didn't detect the resemblance.\n\u201cI think the crew does supply little surprises every once in a while,\u201d Martin says. (USA TODAY has reached out to Hulu for comment.)\n'Only Murders' doesn't change at all in Season 4. Maybe that works for you!\nThe series\u2019 stars were also surprised by another bit from the episode: the all-out brawl between Doreen and Oliver\u2019s girlfriend Loretta (Streep). Loretta, who thinks Oliver broke up with her in a text message, flies in from Los Angeles. Her presence enrages Doreen, who\u2019s developed a bit of a crush on Oliver.\nDoreen\u2019s jealousy erupts into a squabble.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down. Why don\u2019t you go back to Beverly Hills?\u201d Doreen demands, shoving Loretta.\n\u201cYou need to get out of my house, you Hollywood hussy,\u201d she adds with another push that sends Loretta over the back of a sofa. Doreen then hops onto the couch and grabs Loretta, forcing one of her signature pigtails into her mouth.\n\u201cWhy are you eating your braids?\u201d Doreen asks as Loretta wrestles to get free. Loretta voices concern for her pacemaker, a ruse to escape Doreen\u2019s hold.\n\u201cI was acting,\u201d Loretta boasts and sends Doreen sailing with a kick.\nLoretta then climbs on top of her victim and begins whipping Doreen with a fake braid that Doreen sported to win Oliver\u2019s attention.\nSelena Gomez is a billionaire with $1.3 billion net worth from Rare Beauty success\nWhen Martin read the script for the episode, he predicted it would be \u201ca hilariously funny scene to see Meryl Streep and Melissa McCarthy go at each other.\u201d But he didn\u2019t realize how game the actresses would be.\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Let's rehearse it,\u2019 and these two, Melissa and Meryl, went at it on their own, over the sofas, and did everything themselves,\u201d Martin says. \u201cI was stunned! I have to say my mouth was agog!\u201d\n\u201cThey didn't need the stunt doubles!\u201d Gomez says. \u201cThey were great!\u201d\n\u201cThey just really went for it,\u201d Martin adds, \u201cand I thought this is going to be one of the funniest scenes of all time.\u201d\n\u201cI was there,\u201d Short says. \u201cBut when I saw it all cut together, I was still startled that it was clearly Meryl and Melissa doing this. It's very aggressive. Very funny.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s episode also has heart. Loretta ends up proposing to Oliver after learning he thought about getting engaged. \u201cDespite your obvious pathologies, I\u2019m here still,\u201d Loretta tells her love. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going anywhere, and I sign on to your crazy for a lifetime.\u201d\nThen she extends her hand, holding a pearl doll\u2019s bracelet. \u201cI\u2019m proposing to you Oliver,\u201d she explains. \u201cI want to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, before I accept, just out of curiosity, is there any family money?\u201d he jokes before agreeing and planting a smooch on his bride-to-be.\nMartin jests that at first Short thought the engagement to Streep \u201cwas real.\u201d\n\u201cI kept saying, \u2018No, guys. I know real,\u2019\u201d Short says, playing along. He describes the scripted engagement as \u201cdelightful.\u201d\n\u201cIt made sense, because you kind of felt at the end of Season 3 that this couple wasn't finished, and that they were going to continue,\u201d Short says, \u201cand the obvious next step was marriage.\u201d"
