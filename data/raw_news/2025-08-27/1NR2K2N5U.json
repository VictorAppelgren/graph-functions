      "text": "Authorities have reportedly identified the man who police say opened fire on children at a Catholic school in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Wednesday before killing himself.\nAuthorities identified Robin Westman, a man in his early 20s, as the gunman who killed two children while they attended Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, injured 17 other people and fatally shot himself Wednesday morning, local and national news outlets reported, citing law enforcement sources. Videos from a channel bearing Westman\u2019s name were posted on YouTube around the time of the attack, showing disturbing footage featuring multiple guns, cartridges and ammunition with statements written on the weaponry such as \u201cwhere is your God?\u201d and other ramblings, the Daily Caller News Foundation found. (RELATED: \u2018Horrific Shooting\u2019 Reported At Catholic School)\nWe have confirmation that the shooter at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, MN was a 22 year-old man, claiming to be transgender.\nThis deranged monster targeted our most vulnerable: young children praying in their first morning Mass of the school year. This deeply sick\u2026\n\u2014 Secretary Kristi Noem (@Sec_Noem) August 27, 2025\nThe videos, which the DCNF saved before they were deleted, show what appears to be Westman filming an array of weapons in a bedroom and writings on paper apologizing to his family. A thumbnail image from a four-year-old video on the channel shows a man whose face matches images of Westman shared by The New York Post.\n\u201cI was corrupted by this world and have learned to hate what life is \u2026 I have wanted this for so long. I am not well. I am not right. I am a sad person, haunted by these thoughts that do not go away,\u201d a notebook shown on camera reads.\nOne message written on weaponry in the video said \u201cGuy Bartkus,\u201d an apparent reference to the man who authorities say blew himself up at a fertility clinic in California in May because he believed humans should not procreate. Another name written on a gun was \u201cRupnow,\u201d the last name of a high school student who opened fire at a Christian school in Wisconsin in December before killing herself.\nOther written messages in the videos show a seemingly incoherent mix of racial slurs, a pride flag, calls to kill President Donald Trump, the phrase \u201ckill pedos,\u201d pentagram symbols, and a statement that \u201c6 million wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d apparently referring to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. One of Westman\u2019s guns was inscribed, \u201cThere is no message.\u201d\nAnother clip of the footage shows a picture of Jesus Christ on a shooting target, while the words \u201cfuck everything that you stand for\u201d are seen on one of the cartridges.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed in an X post Wednesday afternoon that the gunman wrote \u201cFor the Children,\u201d \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d and \u201cKill Donald Trump\u201d on a cartridge, matching what the deleted videos show.\n\u201cWe have confirmation that the shooter at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, MN was a 22 year-old man, claiming to be transgender,\u201d Noem wrote. FBI Director Kash Patel also posted that Westman changed his name from Robert to Robin.\n\u201cThe FBI is investigating this shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics,\u201d Patel wrote.\nThe suspected gunman did not have an extensive criminal history, authorities said Wednesday, according to FOX9.\nThe FBI\u2019s Minneapolis office and the Minneapolis Police Department did not respond to the DCNF\u2019s requests for comment.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
