      "feedback": "Actionable edits to upgrade to world-class quality: condense the piece into 4–6 executive bullets that deliver a single, crisp house view (AI-led productivity as the core long-run driver; tariffs around 15% with potential escalation; domestic-capex winners in semiconductors/data-center infra; autos under margin pressure; avoid repetition). Build a tight regime-tree with explicit triggers, probabilities (A≈50%, B≈30%, C≈20%), and clear invalidation rules (e.g., tariff reversal toward 27.5% or policy shifts that blunt productivity incentives) and align every claim to NL5YYTLF2/SGB2PAZGK and the cited sources; map Regimes I–III to market implications (capex reallocation, risk premia, and sector leadership). Sharpen the causal chain from AI productivity to capex to earnings by explicitly anchoring to base-case numbers (Ford: +≈17% 2025 price path; EV losses ≈ $1.3B; forward P/E ≈ 8; dividend ≈ 5%; GM Cadillac/U.S. fab cadence ≈ 2M vehicles/year) with citations after each data point (22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW; WTNT85IPR). Integrate near-term windows (0–3 weeks; 0–6 weeks) into a single watchlist: tariff pass-through dynamics, OBBBA/tariff evolution, GM/Cadillac capacity milestones, and EV-margin milestones, all tied to the regime state; keep these anchored to S15934PBQ, EPJYXB7DX, WTNT85IPR, F8GF45MEU, 6OOEK8TUR, and J99EM2TPZ. Finally, enforce citation discipline and conflict resolution by ensuring every assertion has a source, reconciling any discrepancies (oil-paths in J99EM2TPZ/T1QE6JPIX; macro-floor effects in NL5YYTLF2/SGB2PAZGK) into a single, coherent framework, and trimming nonessential proposals so the length remains within 4–6 sentences/points.",
