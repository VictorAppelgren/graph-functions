  "title": "Trump's Washington police takeover echoes history of racist narratives about urban crime",
  "description": "President Donald Trump has taken control of the District of Columbia\u2019s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation\u2019s capital. He argued Monday the...",
  "content": "Even as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the president promised a \"historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\" His rhetoric echoed that used by conservative politicians going back decades who have denounced American cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressive politicians, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention.\n\nBut for many residents, the prospect of federal troops surging into the district\u2019s neighborhoods represents an alarming violation of local agency. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action.\n\nApril Goggans, a longtime Washington resident and grassroots organizer, said she was not surprised by Trump's actions. Communities had been preparing for a potential federal crackdown in the district since the summer of 2020, when Trump deployed National Guard troops during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you fall on the political scale, understand that this could be you, your children, your grandmother, your co-worker who are brutalized or have certain rights violated,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,\u201d said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\nConservative lawmakers have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major American cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. Republicans have called for greater police crackdowns in cities since at least the 1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a \"law and order\" agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his \u201cSouthern Strategy.\u201d Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians ranging from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from cities like Washington for decades.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump\u2019s takeover of the local police force \u201cunsettling\u201d but not without precedent. The mayor kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference following Trump\u2019s announcement but decried the president\u2019s reasoning as a \u201cso-called emergency\u201d and said the district\u2019s residents \u201cknow that access to our democracy is tenuous.\u201d\n\nTrump threatened to \u201ctake over\u201d and \u201cbeautify\u201d the nation\u2019s capital on the campaign trail and claimed the district was \u201ca nightmare of murder and crime.\u201d He also argued the city was \u201chorribly run\u201d and said his team intended \u201cto take it away from the mayor.\u201d The president repeated comments he\u2019d previously made about some of the nation\u2019s largest cities during his news conference, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland, California, and his hometown of New York City. All are currently run by Black mayors.\n\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities in a very bad, New York is a problem. And then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We don\u2019t even mention that anymore. They\u2019re so far gone. We\u2019re not going to let it happen,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s rhetoric \"paints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people\u2019s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,\u201d Wiley said.",

Critics, including local leaders and civil rights advocates, argue that such actions threaten local agency and could set a precedent for similar measures in other cities with majority non-white populations. The president's claims of crime and disorder in these areas have been met with skepticism, as they reflect a long-standing narrative used by conservative politicians to advocate for increased law enforcement.",
