  "title": "What\u2019s Keeping Supply Chains Afloat Amidst The Tariffs And Uncertainty?",
  "description": "Tariffs keep shifting, but supply chains hold steady thanks to predictive intelligence, scenario planning, and experts rewiring global trade in real time.",
  "content": "President Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d is behind us, and tariffs have gone up, down, and sideways, often during the course of the same day, leaving supply chains in a state of disarray.\n\nThe only constant left is uncertainty, to the point where the global, WTO-moderated trade order has rarely been tested this hard and never in so many places at once.\n\n\u201cThe multilateral trade system was designed for stability, gradual change, and predictability,\u201d says Dr. Mia Mikic, former Director of Trade, Innovation and Investment at the United Nations. \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing now is the opposite: constant policy shifts, unpredictable tariff changes, and a trading environment where the rules can change overnight.\u201d\n\nWhat the current administration has delivered is a system shock.\n\nAnd amidst all the shake-up, you could be forgiven for thinking the surface looks surprisingly calm. The Suez Canal is more open than it was when Ever Given famously wedged itself across its span, goods are still flowing, and prices haven\u2019t pushed household budgets too far over the edge.\n\nThat calm can be misleading. It\u2019s not that tariffs haven\u2019t altered the system, because they have. But the apparent stability we see is thanks to thousands of experts working overtime to rewire their supply chains on the fly, with parameters that update daily.\n\nAnd there\u2019s almost no one to sing their praises.\n\nThe new imperative of supply chain management; predictive intelligence\n\nMikic recalls a not-so-distant past where supply chains had the luxury of time. \u201cYou would set up your HS codes, sign the trade agreements, and operate under those conditions for years,\u201d she says. \u201cCompanies would plan expansions or new sourcing over a decade. Now, a tweet can change the preferred route for a product by the end of the week.\u201d\n\nThe speed of change has made traditional mapping tools, even sophisticated ones, feel sluggish. Predictive intelligence has moved from a nice-to-have to a baseline requirement.\n\nThat shift has opened the door for firms like interos.ai. The AI-powered supply chain risk intelligence company maps and monitors more than 250 million companies and more than 11 billion supplier-buyer relationships against multiple risk signals, but what it really provides them with is a toolkit to rebuild resilience.\n\n\u201cResilience has gone from a buzzword that is simulated on spreadsheets to a boardroom demand where you need to show exactly how it is operationalized,\u201d says Ted Krantz, CEO of interos.ai. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer enough to monitor risks. Companies need to anticipate and act before the risks impact your operations.\u201d\n\n\n\n The demand Krantz is describing is derived from something directly measurable: profits.\n\nIn a tariff-volatile world, the ability to model a change in duty rates in one jurisdiction and immediately see the downstream effects can be worth millions, if not hundreds of them.\n\n\u201cClients are asking for systems that map relationships, run scenarios, and propose actionable alternatives in hours, not weeks because they know that that\u2019s where the competitive advantage is right now,\u201d Krantz says.\n\nMapping is only part of the equation. Clients now expect insight into which moves will keep goods flowing and margins intact. That expectation is pushing engineering teams to their limits.\n\n\u201cIf our clients had their way, there\u2019d be a new feature rolled out every day,\u201d says Yardley Pohl, Chief Product and Technology Officer at interos.ai. \u201cThey want predictive analytics for specific trade lanes, AI-generated alternative routing plans, instant ESG scoring on substitute suppliers, and they want it all seamlessly integrated into their ERP systems.\u201d\n\nPohl adds that the stakes are driving that urgency: \u201cA single miscalculation on tariffs can erase the margin on an entire product line. In this climate, our users are not just asking for insights; they\u2019re asking for decisions they can act on immediately.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just interos.ai feeling the surge. Providers of shipment visibility, dynamic rerouting, and risk scoring are all reporting unprecedented demand. The reason is simple. Every day a shipment spends idle in a port or gets re-routed without notice is money lost, sometimes irretrievably.\n\nThe supply chain planning games that keep the impact of tariffs at bay\n\nAs much as the system demands, it also rewards those who know how to play it.\n\nEven sanctioned nations have found ways to adapt, Russian oil flowing through Indian ports before making its way to global buyers, Apple moving manufacturing to Vietnam to dodge certain duties, global retailers shifting seasonal production to friendlier jurisdictions on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n\nJust like water finds its level, supply chain teams find the lowest tariff rates as long as they have the tools and the time.\n\nFor Vic Chynoweth, CEO of Tempo, making this work in real time meant a change of tactics as well as mindset. \u201cWe used to talk about de-risking in simulations,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we\u2019re in the ops room, running those scenarios in real time. It\u2019s not theory any more, it\u2019s the day-to-day life of supply chain planners. And when tariffs shift, the clock starts immediately because the entire company could be on the line.\u201d\n\nJust like the risks, the rewards for getting it right are equally outsized. \u201cFor a company like Apple, the right pathing decision can save hundreds of millions,\u201d Chynoweth says. \u201cFor smaller companies, it\u2019s a matter of survival outright. One wrong call on routing or sourcing can mean missing payroll which in turn topples the company.\u201d\n\nChynoweth points to scenario planning as the unsung hero behind the calm we\u2019re seeing at the eye of the storm.\n\n\u201cAgility is critical when tariffs change fast, but agility without a plan is chaos. Our clients are using technology to run dozens of scenarios, evaluate them against current market data, and choose a path that balances risk and delivery for customers and for the company. That\u2019s the difference between resilience and just hanging on, and the supply chain staff is doing miracles with what they have at the moment.\u201d\n\nIndeed, thin margins, inflation-weary consumers, and suppliers who can\u2019t always absorb higher costs make for a fragile environment.\n\nThe complexity is compounded by the fact that tariffs rarely move in isolation. A change in one jurisdiction can trigger reciprocal moves elsewhere, creating a cascade of new costs and compliance requirements.\n\nMikic warns that smaller companies are particularly exposed. \u201cLarge multinationals have teams dedicated to monitoring every policy shift, running models, and executing changes. Smaller firms are often relying on a single supply chain manager who\u2019s also handling procurement, vendor relationships, and logistics. Without access to advanced tools, they\u2019re at a severe disadvantage.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, many of these smaller players have proven surprisingly adaptive.\n\nThe key, Chynoweth says, is empowerment. \u201cWhen you enable managers with the right data and the autonomy to act, they can do remarkable things. It\u2019s alignment across the company that\u2019s hardest to achieve, not the technical fix.\u201d\n\nThe quiet victory for supply chains so far\n\nFor all the stress tests tariffs have thrown at the global trading system, the experts managing supply chains have, so far, kept the system afloat.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the work has been easy, or that the calm surface will last. But in an era of rolling economic shocks, they\u2019ve done something remarkable: kept the world\u2019s goods moving.\n\nKrantz cautions that this isn\u2019t a victory lap. \u201cResilience is a process, not an outcome,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be resilient today and brittle tomorrow if you stop adapting. The companies that will survive the next wave are the ones treating resilience as a core competency, not a crisis response.\u201d\n\nThe risk is that this adaptability is being taken for granted. The same agility that\u2019s keeping shelves stocked and factories running is powered by human judgment, not just AI dashboards. And the pool of people who can do it well is small \u2014 and getting smaller, as burnout pushes some out of the profession.\n\nThe longer this uncertainty lasts, the more strain builds in the system. Predictive intelligence may give supply chains more elasticity than they\u2019ve ever had, but elasticity has its limits. Snap it too often, and eventually, it breaks.\n\nFor now, though, the game continues. Somewhere in a control room, a supply chain director is rerouting shipments, a project manager is revising risk models, and an AI engine is running thousands of tariff scenarios an hour. The calm you see in the ports and on the shelves is them, holding the line.\n\nThe question is, how much longer can supply chains keep it together?",

      "text": "Topline\nThe Ever Given, the giant container ship that blocked one of the world\u2019s most important shipping lanes for days in March has finally been freed and has set sail Wednesday after months of protracted legal wrangling over compensation between the ship\u2019s owners, insurers and Egyptian officials.\nKey Facts\nThe Ever Given reportedly weighed anchor Wednesday, leaving the position in Great Bitter Lake it has held since being freed from the Suez Canal three months ago.\nEgyptian officials impounded the 400m (1,300ft) boat as they pursued over $900 million in compensation for the ship\u2019s rescue, losses and damages for blocking the shipping lane, a figure that the vessel\u2019s insurer rejected as excessive.\nThe Suez Canal Authority said it had reached a deal with the ship\u2019s owners on Monday, though did not reveal details on the settlement.\nThe vessel, led by two tugs, is set to continue its journey through the canal and on towards the Mediterranean.\nKey Background\nThe sky-scraper-sized Ever Given became wedged across the Suez Canal in late March, blocking traffic along one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes in both directions for nearly a week as teams raced to dislodge it. Around 20,000 ships travel through the canal a year and about 12% of global trade. The disruption sparked a crisis in international trade, with shipping delays, oil price rises, a surge in shipping costs and delayed traffic snarling ports for months as ships diverted or delayed arrived off-schedule. The issue highlighted the fragility of global supply chains and could snarl up courts for years as the many insurers and businesses around the world try to recoup costs.\nWhat To Watch For\nThe Ever Given is now headed to Egypt\u2019s Port Said for safety checks, before sailing to the Netherlands and the U.K. It has around 18,300 cargo containers aboard which will arrive months later than expected. Reportedly, the ship\u2019s cargo includes: lemons, tofu, nails, camping equipment, swimwear alongside gear from Lenovo, Dixons and Ikea.\nFurther Reading\nThe untold story of the big boat that broke the world (Wired)\nEver Given: Ship that blocked Suez Canal sets sail after deal signed (BBC)\nEver Given container ship under way for departure from Suez Canal (Reuters)\nFrom bamboo to barbecues: the cargo caught up in Ever Given legal battle (Guardian)"

      "text": "Topline\nThe White House announced Monday that President Donald Trump is slated to sign an order delaying his 90-day tariff pause by another month, as the president began announcing a suite of new tariff rates on foreign goods, sending letters to countries including Japan, South Korea and Malaysia that impose tariff rates of 25% or higher.\nKey Facts\nTrump posted two nearly identical letters on his Truth Social account early Monday, which were addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, informing them the Trump administration will start charging a 25% tariff on their imports starting Aug. 1.\nThe president continued posting similar letters to other foreign heads of government from Europe, Asia and Africa throughout the day, imposing the steepest tariff rates of 40% on Myanmar and Laos.\nAug. 1 will be the new end date for the administration\u2019s pause on its \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying Monday that Trump will sign an executive order pushing the deadline back.\nLeavitt said letters will continue being sent out to foreign governments until Aug. 1.\nThe letters say the new tariff rates will be on top of any sector-specific tariffs the U.S. levies\u2014such as those on steel\u2014and that they could change in the future, saying the Trump administration will raise its tariffs if the countries impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, and the administration will conversely \u201cperhaps consider an adjustment to this letter\u201d if the countries instead eliminate their tariffs and trade barriers on U.S. goods.\nSouth Korea\u2019s 25% tariff rate is the same rate that Trump initially levied on the country\u2019s goods during his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement\u2014which has been temporarily lowered to 10%\u2014while Japan\u2019s rate is one percent higher than the 24% tariffs Trump initially imposed on the country\u2019s goods.\nThe letters are instances of Trump imposing new tariff rates on the countries without reaching a formal trade agreement, informing each government to receive a letter that their trading relationships with the U.S. have been \u201cfar from Reciprocal.\u201d\nHow Did Stocks React To The Tariffs?\nStocks slightly fell Monday in response to Trump sharing his letters to Japan and South Korea, with losses steepening immediately after the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all down about 1% as of early Monday afternoon, while stocks of Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda had bigger slides, dropping by 4%.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cThese Tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your Country,\u201d Trump said in his letters Monday.\nWhich Countries Have Received Tariff Letters?\nIn addition to South Korea and Japan, Trump shared letters Monday to the governments of Myanmar (imposing a 40% tariff rate), Laos (40% tariff rate), Cambodia (36% tariff rate), Thailand (36% tariff rate), Bangladesh (35% tariff rate), Serbia (35% tariff rate), Indonesia (32% tariff rate), South Africa (30% tariff rate), Bosnia and Herzegovina (30% tariff rate), Kazakhstan (25% tariff rate), Malaysia (25% tariff rate), and Tunisia (25% tariff rate).\nWhat To Watch For\nTrump\u2019s decision to extend the tariff pause comes shortly before it was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday morning. It still remains to be seen if the deadline will be pushed back again and what the final tariff rates will be whenever it does take effect, given that tariff rates are still in flux even for countries the Trump administration sends letters to.\nWhat Other Countries Could Get Letters Or Reach Deals Next?\nThe Trump administration has not given any specifics on which countries it will prioritize for sending letters to or reaching trade deals with before the Wednesday deadline. The European Union has expressed confidence in recent days it will reach some sort of trade agreement with the U.S. before the deadline, with EU trade spokesperson Olof Gill saying Monday, \u201cWe\u2019re fully geared up to get an agreement in principle by Wednesday, and we\u2019re firing on all cylinders to that effect.\u201d Thailand has also offered concessions to the U.S. in order to avoid a 36% tariff rate, Bloomberg reported Sunday, and negotiations reportedly still remain ongoing with countries including India, Indonesia and Switzerland.\nKey Background\nTrump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs have been a major source of controversy since the president first imposed them in early April, over concerns from economists that doing so would raise prices for U.S. consumers and harm the economy. The president imposed sweeping tariffs on nearly all countries that ranged from 10% to 50%, but paused the worst of the tariffs a week later, after the tariff announcement caused the stock market to plunge and sparked fears of a recession. Trump officials vowed to use the 90-day pause to aggressively reach trade deals with foreign countries\u2014predicting they\u2019d make \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d\u2014but as of Monday morning, the U.S. had so far only reached formal agreements with the U.K., Vietnam and China. Trump\u2019s letters to South Korea and Japan come after he has now been teasing for weeks that his administration would simply send out letters imposing new tariff rates if formal deals can\u2019t be reached. The president previously suggested letters would start being sent last Friday, but when that date passed without any notices being announced, Trump then said Sunday evening the letters would begin rolling out Monday afternoon."
