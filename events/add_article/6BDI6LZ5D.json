      "summary": "Russia's recent military advances in Ukraine and its ongoing sabotage efforts across Europe are raising concerns ahead of a summit between President Trump and President Putin. While Ukrainian leaders express cautious optimism about Trump's support for an international peace force, many Ukrainians remain skeptical about the potential for meaningful negotiations, with some resigned to territorial losses for the sake of peace. Concurrently, a report highlights a surge in Russian hybrid operations in Europe, indicating a shift in tactics as Moscow responds to Western military support for Ukraine.",
