  "title": "Wildfire disasters are increasingly in the news, yet less land is burning globally \u2013 here\u2019s why",
  "description": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)",
  "content": "(THE CONVERSATION) Worldwide, an estimated 440 million people were exposed to a wildfire encroaching on their home at some point between 2002 and 2021, new research shows. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to the entire population of the European Union, and the number has been steadily rising \u2013 up 40% over those two decades.\n\nWith intense, destructive fires often in the news, it can seem like more land is burning. And in parts of the world, including western North America, it is.\n\nWe found the driving reasons for those changes in Africa, which has the vast majority of all land burned, but the total burned area there has been falling. Agricultural activities in Africa are increasingly fragmenting wildland areas that are prone to burning. A cultivated farm field and roads can help stop a fire\u2019s spread. But more farms and development in wildland areas also means more people can be exposed to wildfires.\n\nDrawing on our expertise in climate and wildfire sciences and geospatial modeling, we analyzed global wildfire activity over the past two decades. The results highlight some common misperceptions and show how the fire risk to humans is changing.\n\nWildfire is a natural process that has existed for as long as vegetation has covered the Earth. Occasional fires in a forest are healthy. They clear out dead wood and leaf and branch litter, leaving less fuel for future fires to burn. That helps to keep wildfires from becoming too intense.\n\nNorth and South America have both experienced a rise in intense wildfires over the past two decades. Some notable examples include the 2018 Camp Fire in California and the 2023 record-breaking Canadian wildfires, which generated widespread smoke that blanketed large parts of Canada and the eastern United States, and even reached Europe.\n\nThe increase in intense wildfires aligns with the intensification of fire weather around the world. Heat, low humidity and strong winds can make wildfires more likely to spread and harder to control. The number of days conducive to extreme fire behavior and new fire ignitions has increased by more than 50% over the past four decades globally, elevating the odds that the amount of land burned in a particular region sets a new record.\n\nBut fire weather is not the only influence on wildfire risk. The amount of dry vegetation, and whether it\u2019s in a continuous stretch or broken up, influences fire risk. So do ignition sources, such as vehicles and power lines in wildland areas. Human activities can start fires and fuel climate change, which further dries out the land, amplifying wildfire activity. Fire suppression practices that don\u2019t allow low-intensity fires to burn can lead to the accumulation of flammable vegetation, raising the risk of intense fires.\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of wildfire disasters in North America, Europe and Australia have captured global attention. From the deadly 2025 Los Angeles fires to the devastating 2019-2020 Australian bushfires and the 2018 wildfire in Athens, Greece, flames have increasingly encroached upon human settlements, claiming lives and livelihoods.\n\nRemarkably, just five central African countries \u2013 the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola \u2013 experience half of all global human exposure to wildfires, even though they account for less than 3% of the global population. These countries receive sufficient moisture to support plant growth, yet they are dry enough that trees and plants burn in frequent fires that in some places occur multiple times per year.",

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Read more about global cropland change and cropland change in South America.\nNew global maps of cropland from the University of Maryland show that Africa\u2014like South America\u2014has been a hotspot of farmland expansion in the past two decades. In fact, no other continent added as much new farmland. Nearly 79 percent of those new croplands were carved out of natural landscapes rather than pasture or abandoned farmland.\nWhile the rate of cropland expansion slowed in South America over the past two decades, it accelerated in Africa. There was a more than twofold increase from 2016\u20132019 compared to 2004\u20132007. As the map above shows, countries in West, Central, and East Africa all saw large increases in cultivated land.\n\u201cIn Africa, a number of different processes contributed to the changes,\u201d said Peter Potapov, the co-director of the Global Land and Discovery (GLAD) Lab at the University of Maryland. \"You have population going up and thus more subsistence farming happening in poorer areas, especially in the Sahel. But in some countries, you also have major foreign investments, especially from China, to establish operations to produce goods for export.\u201d\nIn some countries\u2014like Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, and Zambia\u2014rapid increases in cultivated areas and modest population growth resulted in increases in per capita farmland. In Senegal, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, rapid population growth outpaced the establishment of new farmland, resulting in significant declines per person. In countries where people rely heavily on subsistence farming for food, this can be a warning sign of potential food insecurity.\nAnalyses of satellite measurements of net primary productivity (NPP) indicate that many of the new cultivated areas in West Africa have relatively low productivity, particularly in areas where grasslands have been converted to farmland (such as the Guinean savanna). Net primary productivity is a measure of how much energy plants store through photosynthesis.\nFarmland also expanded into areas that were mostly forested, with these areas tending to have a much higher NPP values, explained Felicia Akinyemi, the lead author of a separate analysis of cropland change led by University of Bern researchers. As urbanization and development has pushed farmers out of lands closer to population centers, often new farmlands in Africa are established in remote forests and grasslands far from major roads and population centers, according to Akinyemi\u2019s research.\nOverall, the world showed a 25 percent increase in net primary productivity on croplands over the past two decades, a sign that large-scale farms that make heavy use of machinery and fertilizers have found ways of increasing productivity per acre. In Africa, countries with more fertile soils and forests\u2014mostly in central and eastern parts of the continent\u2014tended to have croplands with higher NPP than those in the more arid Sahel region.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen huge leaps in productivity and yields in the past, and that\u2019s going to continue to be key to feeding everybody in the future,\u201d said Potapov. \u201cBut we have to do this in an environmentally sustainable way. If you look at the whole picture\u2014including cropland changes, forest changes, urbanization and development\u2014it\u2019s pretty clear that we cannot just continue to chew up more and more forests and other natural lands indefinitely. Eventually, we\u2019ll simply run out of land.\u201d\nNASA Earth Observatory image by Lauren Dauphin, using data from Potapov, Peter, et al. (2022). Story by Adam Voiland."

      "text": "Abstract\nStudies have identified elevation-dependent warming trends, but investigations of such trends in fire danger are absent in the literature. Here, we demonstrate that while there have been widespread increases in fire danger across the mountainous western US from 1979 to 2020, trends were most acute at high-elevation regions above 3000 m. The greatest increase in the number of days conducive to large fires occurred at 2500\u20133000 m, adding 63 critical fire danger days between 1979 and 2020. This includes 22 critical fire danger days occurring outside the warm season (May\u2013September). Furthermore, our findings indicate increased elevational synchronization of fire danger in western US mountains, which can facilitate increased geographic opportunities for ignitions and fire spread that further complicate fire management operations. We hypothesize that several physical mechanisms underpinned the observed trends, including elevationally disparate impacts of earlier snowmelt, intensified land-atmosphere feedbacks, irrigation, and aerosols, in addition to widespread warming/drying.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nMountains provide a variety of ecosystem services, including supplying about 50% of freshwater globally and an even higher fraction in mountainous arid regions (e.g., 70% of runoff in the western US)1,2. Orographic temperature and precipitation gradients in montane areas facilitate stratified vegetation belts3, which promote local hotspots of biodiversity with a high degree of complexity that are particularly vulnerable to ecosystem changes in response to chronic (e.g., warming) and/or acute (e.g., wildfire) stressors4. Even small perturbations in these mountainous areas have large repercussions for hydrological and ecological processes, with cascading effects on downstream human-environmental systems3,5,6,7.\nA growing body of literature points to elevation-dependent trends in meteorological and land surface characteristics in montane regions of the world in response to the underlying warming signal6,7,8. In particular, more rapid warming of surface air temperature has been documented at higher elevations compared to that of lower elevations in many regions globally7,9. Similarly, trends in land surface temperature10, reference evapotranspiration11, snow cover and snow water equivalent12,13, and vegetation greening14,15 have also been documented to vary across elevational gradients. Furthermore, elevation-dependent precipitation trends are observed in some regions, although the sign of such changes and associated mechanisms vary across studies2,16.\nChanges in the energy and water balance alter the fire danger level17, which is defined as the potential for a fire to ignite, spread and require suppression action. The literature has shown widespread increases in fire danger in many regions globally18,19,20,21, but how fire danger trends change across the elevational gradient has not been studied. Recent literature shows that atmospheric warming weakened the high-elevation flammability barrier and enabled the upslope advance of fires22, and facilitated high-elevation fires that are unprecedented in modern history23. Here we use the fire danger representation in the US National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS)24 to investigate trends in fire danger across elevations. We note that NFDRS fire danger indices were empirically derived based on mathematical models of fire behavior, and they do not fully capture the energy and water balance related to fuels and fire24. Previous studies have linked these indices with regional burned area25 and the growth of individual fires26, and they are operationally used by fire management agencies across the US27.\nWe evaluated elevation-dependent trends in fire danger indices between 1979 and 2020 across 15 level III Omernik ecoregions of the western US28 that are mountainous. We augmented this list with a variety of meteorological variables that are commonly used in fire studies29,30 and posed two questions: (1) Are there elevation-dependent trends in fire danger indices across montane regions of the western US? (2) If so, do they culminate in the elevational synchronization of fire danger? We answered these questions using the gridMET dataset of daily meteorological and NFDRS variables (~4 km grid)31, Omernik level III ecoregions map from the US Environmental Protection Agency28, and the National Elevation Dataset (10 m resolution) from the US Geological Survey. We present the results of the energy release component (ERC, Fuel Model G in NFDRS 7724) in the main paper and all other NFDRS indices (burning index [BI], 100-h and 1000-h dead fuel moisture\u2014FM100 and FM1000, respectively) and meteorological variables (vapor pressure deficit [VPD], temperature, relative and specific humidity, and reference evapotranspiration) in the Supplementary Information. ERC indicates the available energy per unit area at the flame front, measuring the dryness of dead and live fuels. ERC is less directly influenced by temperature than other fire danger indices. It is, however, strongly influenced by relative humidity\u2014which is in turn related to temperature\u2014and precipitation. Here, we select a fuel-agnostic measure across western landscapes through a single fuel model (model G) not to conflate heterogeneity in vegetation distribution with heterogeneity in climate trends. We, however, show that general conclusions hold for other fire danger indices that are not dependent on the fuel model.\nResults\nElevation-dependent trends in warm-season ERC\nAll fire danger indices, as well as meteorological variables, showed marked drying/warming trends over the period of 1979\u20132020 in all 15 mountainous ecoregions of the western US and across all elevation bands (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. S1\u2013S8). Temporal trends in warm-season-average (hereafter warm-season; May\u2013September) fire danger indices were computed over 500 m elevation bands in each ecoregion using least squares linear regression (e.g., Fig. 1a), and linear slope of trends was calculated across elevation bands (e.g., Fig. 1b). The former indicates temporal trends in fire danger indices in each band, whereas the latter points out whether or not trends are magnified at higher elevations compared to the lower land.\nWarm-season ERC trends were most pronounced at higher elevations and least pronounced at lower elevations (Fig. 1a). Median ERC among all ecoregions increased by nearly 15 units during 1979\u20132020 in the highest elevation band (>3000 m). By contrast, median ERC across all ecoregions increased by only ~6 units\u2014smallest across all elevation bands\u2014during 1979\u20132020 in the lowest elevation band (0\u2013500 m) (Fig. 1a). Among individual ecoregions and elevation bands, the largest increase in ERC (17 units) from 1979 to 2020 was observed at >3000 m in Central Basin and Range, whereas the smallest increase in ERC (1 unit) was observed in the 0\u2013500 m elevation band of the maritime affected North Cascades (Fig. 1a).\nPositive elevation-dependent ERC trends (i.e., larger increases in ERC with elevation gain) were found in 13 of the 15 studied ecoregions (Fig. 1b). This trend is even more pronounced for dead fuel moisture (FM100 and FM1000), with all ecoregions showing more marked drying trends in higher elevations (Supplementary Figs. S3, S4). Positive elevational ERC slopes range between 1 and 3 units/km in the 42 years of study (Fig. 1b). For Central Basin and Range, for example, the highest elevations (>3000 m) had an additional 6.4 units of increase in ERC compared to lower elevations (1000\u20131500 m) from 1979 to 2020. Accelerated increases in fire danger at higher elevations imply synchronization of fire danger across elevations, posing marked fire management challenges22,32,33,34.\nWarm-season average ERC in the most recent decade (2011\u20132020) was larger than that of the earliest decade (1981\u20131990) in all ecoregions and across all elevation bands (Fig. 2). Similar drying/warming behavior was observed when viewed through the lens of other fire danger indices and meteorological variables (Supplementary Figs. S9\u2013S17). The largest median relative increase in warm-season ERC (19%) during 2011\u20132020 vs. 1981\u20131990 across all ecoregions was observed in the highest elevations (>3000 m), and the smallest relative increase (10%) was observed in the lowest elevations (0\u2013500 m). Furthermore, a range of different patterns are observed in warm-season ERC values across different elevation bands within and between ecoregions (Fig. 2). Some ecoregions (e.g., Sierra Nevada) were associated with a comparable range of warm-season ERC values across elevation bands, whereas others (e.g., Central Basin and Range) showed widely different values across the elevational gradient (Fig. 2). In general, the elevational gradient of warm-season ERC climatology is more pronounced in drier/warmer ecoregions (Fig. 2). Southern ecoregions (e.g., New Mexico Plateau/Mountains) were expectedly associated with a higher warm-season ERC range compared to northern ecoregions (e.g., Canadian Rockies), which follow latitudinal temperature gradients (Fig. 2).\nWarm-season average temperature generally decreases monotonically with elevation gain, but elevational relationships of fire danger indices are non-monotonic (Fig. 3). Fire danger indices depend on the energy balance driven by moisture availability, evaporative demand, and temperature (as well as wind for BI) and are hence not merely a simple function of temperature. Responses of ERC, BI, and VPD, as well as FM100, FM1000 range from (1) monotonically decreasing (increasing for FM100 and FM1000) with elevation (Fig. 3a; Arizona/New Mexico Mountains) to (2) increasing (decreasing for FM100 and FM1000) in response to elevation gain (Fig. 3b; Cascades), and (3) increasing (decreasing for FM100 and FM1000) to a certain elevation band and a reversed trend afterward (Fig. 3c; Sierra Nevada). We hypothesize that lower temperature and higher moisture availability in higher elevations in Arizona/New Mexico mountains lead to the monotonic decline in fire danger with elevation (Fig. 3a). By contrast, the lower elevation western slope of the Cascades is impacted by maritime air mass leading to reduced fire danger indices compared to higher elevations (Fig. 3b). In Sierra Nevada, lower elevations are adjacent to California\u2019s Central Valley that is heavily irrigated and promotes elevated humidity in the boundary layer that moderates ERC35, whereas lower humidity in mid-elevations (1000\u20132000 m) on the western slope of the region fosters the most intense fire danger indices while decreased temperature and increased moisture (e.g., due to orographic increase in precipitation and snow cover) promote reduced fire danger indices at higher elevations (>2000 m). Other ecoregions are shown in Supplementary Figs. S18\u2013S29.\nElevation-dependent increase in critical fire danger days\nWe now turn our attention to critical fire danger days, which are associated with high fire activity and potential for fire growth. We considered a threshold of ERC = 60 as the tipping point for increased fire activity across all studied ecoregions, following Brown et al.36 that showed a majority of large forest fires (>400 ha) in the western US started on days with ERC \u2265 60. Our analysis of fire records in the Fire Occurrence Database37 confirmed this reporting and showed that 77 and 83% of large (>400 ha) and very large (4000 ha) fires from 1992 to 2020 in the studied ecoregions were associated with ERC \u2265 60 on their discovery date. These statistics also hold for the entire western US. The constant threshold of ERC = 60 is selected here to warrant consistency and inter-comparability across ecoregions.\nWe found an increase in critical fire danger days during 1979\u20132020 in all elevation bands and all ecoregions (Fig. 4a). The highest median increase in critical fire danger days in all ecoregions during the 42 years of this study occurred between 2500 and 3000 m with an overall increase of 63 days, of which 22 days occurred outside of the warm season (Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S3). By contrast, the lowest median increase in critical fire danger days across all ecoregions occurred in the 0\u2013500 m elevation band, adding >22 extra fire danger days in 42 years (Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S3; Fig. 4a). Higher elevations in 10 of the 15 studied montane ecoregions were associated with a larger rate of increase in critical fire danger days compared to lower elevations (Fig. 4b). The highest slope of trend in critical fire danger days as a function of elevation was observed in the Central Basin and Range, indicating an additional >28 fire danger days in 42 years per 1 km of elevation gain (Fig. 4b).\nTrends in critical fire danger days viewed through the lens of other fire danger indices follow a similar pattern as that of ERC (Supplementary Figs. S30\u2013S32).\nThe largest median rate of the relative increase in annual critical fire danger days (119%), based on ERC, across all ecoregions during 2011\u20132020 as compared to 1981\u20131990 was observed at >3000 m, and the lowest relative increasing rates were observed at <1500 m ranging between 38 and 43% (Fig. 5). Results based on other fire danger indices follow a similar pattern (Supplementary Figs. S33\u2013S35). Furthermore, critical fire danger days synchronized across all elevation bands in the most recent decade in many ecoregions, such as Central Basin and Range and Sierra Nevada, indicating lessened topographical fire danger relief in a warming climate (Fig. 5). However, the decrease of critical fire danger days with elevation gain, due to the lower baseline ERC at higher elevations (Fig. 2), is noted in multiple ecoregions, such as Wasatch and Unita Mountains (Fig. 5). Finally, the number of critical fire danger days across ecoregions follow the latitudinal temperature gradient with the highest occurring in the southern region and the lowest in the northern region (Fig. 5). This is expected given baseline ERC values are higher in the southern ecoregions and our adopted fire danger threshold (ERC = 60) is constant across all studied ecoregions.\nFinally, to augment this analysis, we also used the 75th and the 95th percentiles of daily ERC records from 1979 to 2020 in each grid pooled over the entire calendar year as the threshold for high and extreme fire danger conditions (Supplementary Fig. S36). We then estimated the number of high and extreme fire danger days in each grid and averaged them in each elevation band, and replicated our trend analysis. Results (Supplementary Figs. S37\u2013S40) confirmed the findings of the constant threshold-based analysis (ERC = 60), although nuanced differences exist between the two approaches\u2014especially between those of the constant and the 95th percentile-based thresholds. Furthermore, we conducted this percentile-based threshold analysis for other variables (Supplementary Figs. S41\u2013S52) with similar conclusions.\nDiscussion\nHere we documented larger fire danger trends at high elevations compared to low elevations across mountainous ecoregions in the western US over the past four decades. Our results pointed to the synchronization of fire danger across elevations in many ecoregions and indicated the reduction and disappearance of topographical fire danger relief in a warming climate. Elevation-dependent fire danger intensification implies that higher elevations that were historically wet enough to buffer fire ignition and slow/hinder fire propagation have become conducive to large fire activity in recent decades22. This trend is expected to intensify further, given the projected warming and drying trends in the western US38. Elevational synchronization of fire danger along with the documented spatial synchronization of fire danger across the western US forests19 implies further strains on the limited fire suppression and management resources. We also documented concerning trends in critical fire danger days, especially at higher elevations. Our results showed that a marked portion of this increase in critical fire danger days occurred outside of the warm season, particularly in the southern ecoregions with a higher ERC climatology baseline.\nWe recognize that ground observations of meteorological variables are rare at high elevations, which might induce uncertainty in the reported trends based on a gridded product (gridMET31). Our analysis of fire danger trends across the elevation gradient using ground observations, however, confirmed the reported findings (Supplementary Fig. S53), although for a limited number of ecoregions (five) and stations (a total of 79) constrained by data availability. We also note that elevation-dependent warming has been widely demonstrated across the globe, including in the mountains of the western US (Pepin et al.6,7 and references therein); and this trend on the backbone of widespread drying in the fire season39 is expected to induce elevation-dependent fire danger intensification. Furthermore, Alizadeh et al.22 showed that normalized burned area in the high-elevation forests of the western US increased at a higher rate than its low-elevation counterpart from 1984 to 2019, pointing to a weakened flammability barrier in the high elevations, providing secondary evidence for the herein reported trends.\nWe hypothesize that several mechanisms contribute to the elevation-dependent trends in fire danger. Earlier snowmelt and shrinking of snow cover decrease albedo at high elevations that historically stored large snow packs. This contributes to surface warming as a result of increased absorption of incoming solar energy7. While earlier snowmelt may not have directly been the main contributor to the largest intensification rates of fire danger at higher elevations, especially in the warm season, the indirect impact of earlier snowmelt can contribute to soil desiccation and land-atmosphere feedbacks strengthening that intensify fire danger40,41. Land-atmosphere feedbacks have always been a driving factor in water-limited low-elevation regions but have historically been less ubiquitous in energy-limited, moist highlands that have observed the largest soil moisture decline rates in recent decades in response to warming38. The warming and drying cycle, due to land-atmosphere feedback, is further intensified by inhibiting cloud formation and its associated energy balance effects, as well as increasing the boundary layer depth that traps heat in the atmosphere40. Similarly, warming and drying lead to higher cloud base heights, reducing the total precipitation that reaches the ground42.\nAerosols also play a role in the observed trends, as valleys of the western US trap fire smoke, dust, and anthropogenic particles and change long- and short-wave radiative balance7,43. Higher concentrations of aerosols in the valleys buffer the direct impact of the incoming shortwave radiation on the surface weather44. This enables the surface air temperature to be cooler than its potential45. The aerosol impact is lower at high elevations46. Another significant contributor to the smaller intensification of fire drivers in the lowest elevation bands in some ecoregions is the impact of agricultural irrigation on regulating valley temperatures35.\nElevation-dependent intensification of fire danger has important implications for future ecological and hydrological characteristics of montane ecosystems34. High-elevation mesic forests are associated with long return interval (several decades to millennia), high-intensity, stand-replacing fires, and their frequent occurrence may alter the population, community, composition, and structure of these forests47,48,49. Fire impacts compounded by a warming climate also threaten high-elevation plant species by facilitating pathways for low-elevation species, including invasive annual grasses, to move to upper ground50. Increasing high-elevation fire activity also has significant implications for: (1) water availability through removing vegetation cover and impacting snow accumulation and melt34,50, (2) water quality, through introducing various pollutants and facilitating a magnified increase of stream temperature7,51, and (3) landscape morphology, through enhanced erosion rates and stream incision52. In-depth understanding of elevation-dependent trends in fire danger is specifically important as fire suppression efforts are least effective in high-elevation, mesic forests, which when burned can significantly impact the vulnerable highlands\u2019 flora and fauna, and can have adverse effects that cascade to lower elevations that depend on high-elevation emanated ecosystem services53.\nMethods\nWe calculated the warm-season average of meteorological and US National Fire Danger Rating System indices, herein referred to as fire danger indices, using daily values in each grid from the gridMET31 dataset (~4 km resolution), and then averaged them for each 500 m elevation band in 15 mountainous ecoregions of the western US. We selected Omernik level 3 ecoregions28 that encompass mountain ranges of the western US. We then used these variables for (1) estimating least squares linear trends in warm-season averages and (2) quantifying the number of critical fire danger days. We considered fire drivers in each ecoregion separately since each ecoregion includes rather similar ecoclimatic characteristics. We divided each ecoregion to land encapsulated in 500 m elevation bands (e.g., band 1: 0\u2013500 m above sea level, a.s.l., band 2: 500\u20131000 m a.s.l., \u2026, band 7: >3000 m a.s.l.) to investigate elevation-dependent trends in various biophysical and atmospheric variables. We removed bands with <250 km2 of land (less than 16 grid cells in gridMET) from the analysis to ensure robust results. Supplementary Table S4 lists the surface area encapsulated in each elevation band in each ecoregion.\nWe used daily average temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), energy release component (ERC), burning index (BI), 100-h dead fuel moisture (FM100, representing small diameter fuel), 1000-h dead fuel moisture (FM1000, representing large diameter fuel), minimum and maximum daily relative humidity (Rmin and Rmax, respectively), and specific humidity (SPH). We used the US National Fire Danger Rating System 7724 for the calculation of fire danger indices. Furthermore, we employed the Fuel Model G (dense conifer stands) for ERC and BI calculations over the entire western US landscapes as a fuel-agnostic measure for documenting climate-driven fire danger trends, not to conflate heterogeneity in vegetation distribution with heterogeneity in climate trends. We defined the warm season as May\u2013September since this period is associated with enhanced fire activity in the western US. For warm-season trends, we used the May\u2013September average of each variable. We present the results based on ERC in the main paper and other variables in the Supplementary Information.\nFor critical fire danger days, we counted the number of days in which the daily variable exceeded its defined threshold. This threshold is selected from the literature and is associated with increased fire activity and growth potential36,54. Threshold values were selected as: ERC = 60; FM100 = 8%, FM1000 = 10%, and VPD = 2 kPa54,55. We augmented this analysis with a local percentile-based threshold for high and extreme fire danger days, in which the 75th and 95th (25th and 5th for fuel moisture) percentiles of long-term daily time series of various variables in each grid pooled over the entire calendar year were selected as the threshold, and the number of high and extreme fire danger days in each grid in each year was estimated accordingly. Grid estimates were then averaged over the entire elevation band, which were subsequently used for trend analyses. In all analyses, the slope of linear least squares regression was presented. The underlying warm-season ERC data justified the use of linear trends (Supplementary Fig. S54), but we acknowledge that not all variables necessarily satisfy the assumptions of a linear regression analysis. We provided warm-season averages of all variables in the Supplementary Data to enable more in-depth analyses. Finally, the two-sided t-statistic was used to test the null hypothesis that the slope coefficient of linear regression is equal to zero. Upon rejection of the null hypothesis (p-value \u2264 0.05), we accept the alternative hypothesis that the trend is significant.\nData availability\nThe referenced climate and fire danger data can be obtained from the gridMET dataset available at: https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html.

      "text": "More than 4 million acres of California went up in flames in 2020 \u2013 about 4% of the state\u2019s land area and more than double its previous wildfire record. Five of the state\u2019s six largest fires on record were burning this year.\nIn Colorado, the Pine Gulch fire broke the record for that state\u2019s largest wildfire, only to be surpassed by two larger blazes, the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires.\nOregon saw one of the most destructive fire seasons in its recorded history, with more than 4,000 homes destroyed.\nWhat caused the 2020 fire season to become so extreme?\nFires thrive on three elements: heat, dryness and wind. The 2020 season was dry, but the Western U.S. has seen worse droughts in the recent decade. It had several record-breaking heat waves, but the fires did not necessarily follow the locations with the highest temperatures.\nWhat 2020 did have was heat and dryness hitting simultaneously. When even a moderate drought and heat wave hit a region at the same time, along with wind to fan the flames, it becomes a powerful force that can fuel megafires.\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing in California, Colorado and Oregon this year. Research shows it\u2019s happening more often with higher intensity, and affecting ever-increasing areas.\nClimate change intensified dry-hot extremes\nWe are scientists and engineers who study climate extremes, including wildfires. Our research shows that the probability of a drought and heat wave occurring at the same time in the U.S. has increased significantly over the past century.\nThe kind of dry and hot conditions that would have been expected to occur only once every 25 years on average have occurred five to 10 times in several regions of the U.S. over the past quarter-century. Even more alarming, we found that extreme dry-hot conditions that would have been expected only once every 75 years have occurred three to six times in many areas over the same period.\nWe also found that what triggers these simultaneous extremes appears to be changing.\nDuring the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, the lack of rainfall allowed the air to become hotter, and that process fueled simultaneous dry and hot conditions. Today, excess heat is a larger driver of dry-hot conditions than lack of rain.\nThis has important implications for the future of dry-hot extremes.\nWarmer air can hold more moisture, so as global temperatures rise, evaporation can suck more water from plants and soil, leading to drier conditions. Higher temperatures and drier conditions mean vegetation is more combustible. A study in 2016 calculated that the excess heat from human-caused climate change was responsible for nearly doubling the amount of Western U.S. forest that burned between 1979 and 2015.\nWorryingly, we have also found that these dry-hot wildfire-fueling conditions can feed on one another and spread downwind.\nWhen soil moisture is low, more solar radiation will turn into sensible heat \u2013 heat you can feel. That heat evaporates more water and further dries the environment. This cycle continues until a large-scale weather pattern breaks it. The heat can also trigger the same feedback loop in a neighboring region, extending the dry-hot conditions and raising the probability of dry-hot extremes across broad stretches of the country.\nAll of this translates into higher wildfire risk for the Western U.S.\nIn Southern California, for example, we found that the number of dry-hot-windy days has increased at a greater rate than dry, hot or windy days individually over the past four decades, tripling the number of megafire danger days in the region.\n2020 wasn\u2019t normal, but what is normal?\nIf 2020 has proved anything, it is to expect the unexpected.\nBefore this year, Colorado had not recorded a fire of over 10,000 acres starting in October. This year, the East Troublesome fire grew from about 20,000 acres to over 100,000 acres in less than 24 hours on Oct. 21, and it was nearly 200,000 acres by the time a snowstorm stopped its advance. Instead of going skiing, hundreds of Coloradans evacuated their homes and nervously watched whether that fire would merge with another giant blaze.\nThis is not \u201cthe new normal\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s the new abnormal. In a warming climate, looking at what happened in the past no longer offers a sense of what to expect in the future.\n\u201cThe growth that you see on this fire is unheard of,\u201d Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin said of the East Troublesome fire on Oct. 22. \u201cWe plan for the worst. This is the worst of the worst of the worst.\u201d\n[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation\u2019s newsletter.]\nThere are other drivers of the rise in fire damage, as well. More people moving into wildland areas means there are more cars and power lines and other potential ignition sources. Historical efforts to control fires have also meant more undergrowth in areas that would have naturally burned periodically in smaller fires.\nThe question now is how to manage this \u201cnew abnormal\u201d in the face of a warming climate.\nIn the U.S., one in three houses are built in the wildland-urban interface. Development plans, construction techniques and building codes can do more to account for wildfire risks, including avoiding flammable materials and potential sources of sparks. Importantly, citizens and policymakers need to tackle the problem at its root: That includes cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.\nThis story has been updated with numbers from the late fire season."

      "text": "AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES\nThank you for joining us on the front line to help wildlife, restore what was lost, and protect and future-proof Australia.\nIt was a year we\u2019ll never forget. Even before the challenges of COVID-19, Australia was hit hard by bushfires during summer 2019-20 - the most catastrophic bushfire season ever experienced in the country\u2019s history. So much was lost, and the impacts will be felt for years to come.\nUp to 19 million hectares were burnt, with 12.6 million hectares primarily forest and bushland. 33 lives were lost and around 3,094 homes destroyed.\nEarly in January 2020, WWF estimated that at that time, 1.25 billion animals had been killed. As the fires raged well into March, and destroyed even more habitat, we had a scientific duty to update that figure to understand the true impact on our wildlife and natural landscapes.\nAn interim report was released six months on from the fires that we commissioned from a team of scientists from Australian universities, and the findings are shocking. Nearly 3 billion animals were impacted by the bushfires. At the peak of the fires, our focus was to get emergency support to the amazing front line organisations, rescuing and caring for injured and fire-affected wildlife. We then focused on the long road to recovery and future-proofing our country for the fire seasons ahead. We\u2019ve worked hard to make sure the money our generous supporters donated made an impact where it was needed most. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve funded 256 projects and collaborated with over 190 partners. Thank you for making all this work possible.\nHow your donation helped Australia recover from the bushfires\nIn response to the 2019-20 bushfires, WWF-Australia launched a critical emergency fund, the Australian Wildlife and Nature Recovery Fund. Thanks to the contributions from generous partners and supporters worldwide, we raised over $50 million for wildlife and nature recovery.\nStories From the Bushfire Front Lines\nRead and watch the incredible stories from the field that emerged from the Australian 2019-20 bushfires.\nThanks to your support, when Australian nature needed us, we responded together \u2013 saving and restoring habitats and species across the country.

      "text": "Abstract\nAn increasing number of wildfire disasters have occurred in recent years in the United States. Here we demonstrate that cumulative primary human exposure\u2014the population residing within the perimeters of large wildfires\u2014was 594,850 people from 2000 to 2019 across the contiguous United States (CONUS), 82% of which occurred in the western United States. Primary population exposure increased by 125% in the CONUS in the past two decades; it was noted that there were large statistical uncertainties in the trend analysis due to the short study timeline. Population dynamics from 2000 to 2019 alone accounted for 24% of the observed increase rate in human exposure, and an increased wildfire extent drove the majority of the observed trends. In addition, we document the widespread exposure of roads (412,155 km) and transmission powerlines (14,835 km) to large wildfires in the CONUS, with a relative increase of 58% and 70% in the past two decades, respectively. Our results highlight that deliberate mitigation and adaptation efforts to help societies cope with wildfires are ever more needed.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nWildfire (hereafter called fire) activity has escalated across the United States in recent decades1,2,3. While land management and historical fire suppression have contributed to these trends4, a warming climate is implicated as a main cause of increased fire activity in parts of the United States5,6. A warmer climate is conducive to the amplified concurrence of dry\u2013hot\u2013windy conditions that are a recipe for very large fires with notable societal and ecological impacts7. Furthermore, the population increase in the wildland\u2013urban interface8 (WUI) has contributed to the heightened societal impacts of fires in recent decades9,10,11. WUI expansion not only enhances the number of houses and populace residing in fire-prone lands but also increases the number of anthropogenic ignitions close to values at risk12,13. The confluence of these factors has imposed tragic losses of life, marked socioeconomic disruption, the degradation of ecosystem services and far-reaching indirect adverse impacts14,15,16,17.\nA robust analysis of the impacts of large fires on populations and infrastructure requires exploring not only the trends and drivers of increasing fire activity (that is, hazards) but also the exposure to fire hazards18,19,20. Recent studies have explored fire exposures at the regional scale21,22 and structure loss in the western United States17; however, they did not examine direct human and infrastructure exposure to fire, and their trends, in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Using geospatial and statistical analyses, we quantified population and infrastructure (that is, road and powerline) exposure to large fires in the CONUS from 2000 to 2019, and trends thereof. Next, we examined the contribution of population dynamics (that is, population growth in and migration to areas impacted by fire) in overall trends in human exposure to large fires. Then, we assessed changes in population and infrastructure exposure to large fires per unit area burned from 2000 to 2019. We used annual large-fire perimeters (\u2265400 ha in the western United States and \u2265200 ha in the eastern United States) from 2000 to 2019 from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity programme23, the 2000\u20132019 annual gridded (~100 \u00d7 100 m) population data from WorldPop24, the static road vector data from the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) dataset25 and the static-medium (10\u201370 kV) and high-voltage (>70 kV) powerline vector data from a previous study26.\nResults\nHuman exposure to large fires\nCumulative primary population exposure to fire\u2014defined as the number of people residing within the perimeters of large fires\u2014was estimated at 594,850, 488,200 and 106,650 people in the CONUS, the western United States (the 11 westernmost states in the CONUS) and the eastern United States, respectively, from 2000 to 2019 (Supplementary Data 1 and Fig. 1a,b). We note that residence within fire perimeters does not necessarily translate to direct losses (for example, property damage) as fires burn heterogeneously and include unburned islands within their perimeters27. However, the collocation of fires and populated areas exposes people to direct fire impacts. Furthermore, these statistics are probably an underestimation of the primary impact of fires on the population because (1) we considered only large fires in this study (constrained by fire perimeter data availability) and (2) we defined primary exposure to fire as the population residing within fire boundaries.\nNotably, California accounted for 72% of the cumulative primary population exposure to fire in the CONUS from 2000 to 2019, while only accounting for 15% of the total burned area (Fig. 1d). For reference, California is home to 12% of the CONUS population (2020 statistics) and accounts for 11% of the CONUS population living in the WUI areas8 (2010 statistics). The disproportionately larger fraction of CONUS-wide population exposure to fire in California points to the inflated co-occurrence of fires and human settlements28. Many of the catastrophic fires that impact populations and infrastructure in California occur coincident with offshore, downslope wind-driven fires that spread wildland fires into populated areas9,29.\nWe also estimated secondary exposure\u2014defined as populations within a 5 km buffer around, not within, large-fire perimeters. Secondary exposure probably induced secondary impacts, such as evacuations, socioeconomic disruption and emotional trauma30,31. Cumulative secondary exposure to fire in the CONUS, the western United States and the eastern United States from 2000 to 2019 was 36-fold, 33-fold and 47-fold larger than the primary exposure, respectively.\nHuman exposure trends\nPrimary population exposure to fire increased in the CONUS at a rate of 1,200 people per year (s.e. 1,090; s.e. has a people per year unit that is omitted for brevity) from 2000 to 2019, marking a 125% growth in two decades (Fig. 1). This trend was mainly driven by a 185% increase in the western United States (1,240 people per year, s.e. 1,120; Fig. 1a). We found a decrease in primary population exposure to fire in the eastern United States (\u221240 people per year, s.e. 195; Fig. 1b), indicating a 14% decline in two decades. Furthermore, the annual burned area in large fires increased with a rate of 300 km2 yr\u22121 (s.e. 390), 170 km2 yr\u22121 (s.e. 310) and 130 km2 yr\u22121 (s.e. 140) in the CONUS, the western United States and the eastern United States, respectively, in the past two decades (Supplementary Data 1). Supplementary Fig. 1 shows trends in burned areas from 2000 to 2019.\nAn increasing annual primary population exposure to fire was widespread in the western United States (Fig. 1c), with the largest rate in California (1,165 people per year, s.e. 1,150) that sustained a 225% increase from 2000 to 2019. Note that the increase in population exposure to fire in California was almost identical to that of the CONUS (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 1). Two specific years stand out in California\u2019s observed record, with a total of 82,200 and 101,600 people exposed to primary fire impacts in 2003 and 2018, respectively (Supplementary Data 1). In California, the 2003 Cedar Fire (1,100 km2) and the 2018 Camp Fire (620 km2) claimed 15 and 85 lives and destroyed 2,820 and 18,804 structures, respectively, pinning them as the fourth and first most destructive fires\u2014as measured by structure destruction\u2014in the state\u2019s history as of April 2023. Iconic events dominate the presented statistics in this study, specifically given the limited timeline (2000\u20132019). California also claimed the highest rate of increase in normalized primary population exposure\u2014normalized by state population\u2014across the CONUS in the past two decades (Supplementary Table 1). A majority of the eastern states showed a decrease in primary population exposure to fire in the past two decades (Fig. 1c). There is, however, substantial heterogeneity in the exposure trends in the eastern United States (Fig. 1c); for example, Kansas and Oklahoma observed some of the highest rates of increase in normalized primary population exposure to fire (Supplementary Table 1).\nWe found increasing trends in secondary population exposure to fire in the CONUS (16,730 people per year, s.e. 24,590; Supplementary Data 1), the western United States (10,190 people per year, s.e. 23,025; Fig. 1a) and the eastern United States (6,540 people per year, s.e. 8,220; Fig. 1b), marking a 35%, 27% and 67% increase in two decades, respectively. Results for various buffer levels around large-fire perimeters are included in Supplementary Data 1. Contrasting trends in primary exposure to fire (that is, within large-fire perimeters, \u221240 people per year) versus this secondary exposure estimate (that is, in a 5 km buffer from but not within fire perimeters; 6,540 people per year) in the eastern United States suggest that although fire activity in the proximity of human residence increased in the past two decades, fire behaviour was more controllable in the east. This is driven by a lower baseline of fire danger and lower rates of potential fire spread, compounded by larger land fragmentation and extensive use of prescribed fires to mitigate fuel accumulation specifically in the southeast United States, compared with those in the western United States32. Across the CONUS, 22 states observed increasing trends in secondary exposure to fires from 2000 to 2019, with Florida claiming the largest trend (6,765 people per year, s.e. 3,965) (Supplementary Data 1). Secondary exposure to fires in California was associated with a trend of 5,880 people per year (s.e. 22,600; Fig. 1e). Supplementary Figs. 2\u20135 show the annual accumulated primary and secondary exposure to fires from 2000 to 2019, and trends thereof, within 1 km and 5 km buffers from the perimeters of fires.\nRole of population dynamics in human exposure to large fires\nWe estimated the influence of recent population dynamics\u2014population growth in and migration to fire-impacted areas (that is, within fire perimeters), including WUI growth, in 2000\u2013201914\u2014in the observed trends. Differences between the primary population exposure to fire using a dynamic population (annual from 2000 to 2019) and a counterfactual scenario using a static population fixed at values from 2000 were used to quantify the direct influence of population dynamics on primary population exposure to fire and trends thereof in 2000\u20132019. We estimated that population dynamics accounted for the primary exposure of 41,050 people to fire cumulatively from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS. This amounts to 7% of cumulative primary population exposures to fire in the CONUS in the past two decades, and the remaining 93% is attributed to the fire activity and its encroachment on human settlement in 2000 (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). We also estimated that, cumulatively from 2000 to 2019, an additional 35,740 (7%) and 5,310 (5%) people were exposed to fire (primary exposure) owing to population dynamics in the western United States and the eastern United States, respectively (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). Note that we only examined the first-order impacts of population dynamics on exposure to fires, and a variety of second-order impacts, such as changes in fire ignitions, land fragmentation and fire suppression, which can have increasing or decreasing effects on fire extent, was not explored herein.\nWe found that population dynamics contributed to a 285 people per year (s.e. 95), 270 people per year (s.e. 100) and 15 people per year (s.e. 20) increase in primary population exposure to fire across the CONUS, the western United States and the eastern United States, respectively (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Data 1 and 2). These results, however, showed that only a small fraction of observed trends in the CONUS and the western United States (24% and 22%, respectively) can be attributed to population dynamics in the past two decades, while a majority of the observed trends are due to the increasing extent of fires from 2000 to 2019 and their encroachment on human settlements based on population distribution in 2000. Here too, California claimed the highest rate with a 240 people per year (s.e. 100) increase in primary population exposure to large fires attributable to population dynamics, which accounts for 21% of the observed increase from 2000 to 2019 (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, Supplementary Data 6\u20139 show the contribution of population dynamics to accumulated primary and secondary (that is, within 1 km and 5 km buffers around fire perimeters) population exposure to fires.\nRoad and powerline exposure to large fires\nCumulative road exposure to fire\u2014defined as the length of road occurred in the perimeter of large fires\u2014from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS, the western United States and the eastern United States was 412,155 km, 306,820 km and 105,335 km, which constituted 3.3%, 9.0% and 1.2% of all roads in each region, respectively (Supplementary Data 3). Cumulative powerline (medium and high voltage; \u226510 kV) exposure to fire\u2014defined as the length of powerline occurred within the perimeter of large fires\u2014from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS, the western United States and the eastern United States was 14,835 km, 4,230 km and 10,605 km, which accounted for 1.2%, 5.0% and 0.4% of the total powerline in each region, respectively (Supplementary Data 4). California accounted for the largest fraction of the CONUS\u2019s cumulative road and powerline exposure to fire (18% and 24%, respectively) in the past two decades (Fig. 3e,f).\nIncreasing road and powerline exposure to large fires\nRoad exposure to fire increased in the CONUS at a rate of 485 km yr\u22121 (s.e. 400) from 2000 to 2019, corresponding to a 58% growth in two decades (Fig. 3a). Similar trends were observed both in the western United States (285 km yr\u22121, s.e. 285; Supplementary Data 3) and the eastern United States (200 km yr\u22121, s.e. 205; Supplementary Data 3), a 43% and 113% growth in 20 years, respectively. Here roads are static and trends are only due to changing large-fire activity. Across the CONUS, 25 states observed increased road exposure to fire, with the largest rates in California (130 km yr\u22121, s.e. 100) (Fig. 3c).\nPowerline exposure increased at a rate of 20 km yr\u22121 (s.e. 15) in the CONUS, a growth of 70% in the past 20 years (Fig. 3b). In the western United States and the eastern United States, this trend was 14 km yr\u22121 (s.e. 10) and 7 km yr\u22121 (s.e. 10), a 65% and an 85% growth, respectively (Supplementary Data 4). Similar to road data, powerline data are static. Across the CONUS, 17 states observed an increase in powerline exposure to fire in the past two decades, with the largest rates occurring in Washington (5 km yr\u22121, s.e. 2) and California (5 km yr\u22121, s.e. 5) (Fig. 3d).\nExposure per unit burned area increased\nWe found an increase in primary population exposure per unit burned area in large fires, suggesting that fires have increasingly collocated with human settlements in the past two decades. In the CONUS, we found that an additional 220 people were exposed per 1,000 km2 of fire in two decades (Supplementary Data 1). This increase was more apparent in the western United States, and California in particular, exposing an additional 705 people and 3,950 people per 1,000 km2 of fires in two decades, respectively (Supplementary Data 1). Arizona, Wyoming, Washington and Montana also stand out in the western United States with an additional 700, 650, 300 and 265 primary population exposures per 1,000 km2 of fires in two decades, respectively (Supplementary Data 1). In the eastern United States, however, the population exposure per unit area burned declined, exposing 2,930 fewer people to each 1,000 km2 of fires from 2000 to 2019 (Supplementary Data 1). This was even more pronounced in Florida with 3,185 fewer exposures to 1,000 km2 of fires in the past two decades.\nWe also found disproportionate increases in road exposure to large fires during the past two decades with an additional 165 km, 145 km and 285 km of roads per 1,000 km2 of fire from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS, the western United States and the eastern United States, respectively (Supplementary Data 3). Finally, our results show an increase in powerline exposure per unit burned area in the CONUS and the western United States with an additional 7 km and 8 km of powerline exposed to each 1,000 km2 of fire from 2000 to 2019, respectively, whereas the eastern United States observed 11 km less powerline exposure per 1,000 km2 of fire in 20 years (Supplementary Data 4).\nDiscussion\nWe document that the cumulative primary population exposure to fire was 594,850 people from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS. California accounted for a disproportionately large fraction (72%) of cumulative population exposure in the CONUS from 2000 to 2019, while claiming only 15% of the burned area. Offshore, downslope winds that spread fires into populated areas, under extreme fire behaviour conditions that limit the efficacy of fire-suppression efforts, contributed to the disproportionately larger population exposure to fire in California. Primary human exposure to large fires increased at a rate of 1,200 people per year in the past two decades in the CONUS, marking a 125% growth from 2000 to 2019. This trend was particularly pronounced in the western United States (1,240 people per year; 185% increase in two decades), specifically California (1,165 people per year; 225% growth in 20 years). We note that these trends are associated with a large uncertainty range given the short timeline of this study and high interannual variability of fire extent and exposure. This is common to studies that use spatiotemporally resolved fire records, which are only available for a few decades33. Nevertheless, this analysis offers important information about spatiotemporal patterns and trends of human exposure to large fires in the CONUS.\nWe note that fire impact trends are dominated by iconic events that occur during extreme fire weather34. For example, primary exposure trends from 2000 to 2020 in the CONUS and the western United States are notably more pronounced than those from 2000 to 2019 (Supplementary Table 2) owing to the marked fire activity in 2020. Iconic fire events are mainly the result of compounding effects of dry\u2013hot\u2013windy conditions35. Climate change has systematically increased the probability of concurrence of critical fire drivers and thereby increased the probability of megafires7. Furthermore, background warming has synchronously increased the critical fire danger across the western United States36, which puts pressure on the already stressed fire-suppression resources and further contributes to the increased probability of fire disasters. These factors have culminated in exceedingly more frequent iconic events in recent years7. In fact, three of the deadliest and three of the most destructive fires in California, at the time of this writing, have occurred in the past 6 years.\nWe show that 24% and 22% of observed trends in population exposure to fire from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS and the western United States, respectively, are attributable to population dynamics (for example, WUI growth). This indicates that population increases in fire-impacted areas in the past two decades are only marginally accountable for the increase in population exposure to fire19,37. By contrast, we find that the increased fire extent in 2000\u20132019 intersected with the population footprint from 2000 is responsible for a majority of the increased exposure. This finding bears important implications for the development of fire mitigation and adaptation strategies across the United States, for example, in terms of incentive and deterrent strategies to reduce fire risks to humans.\nPrimary population exposure to fires is arguably smaller than population exposure to other hazards, such as heatwaves, floods and hurricanes, across the CONUS38,39; however, fire poses unique and challenging threats to human lives and infrastructure. For example, fire smoke is known to suffocate exposed populations even before their residences are burned or even when they are not burned at all40. We also note that while immediate impacts of fires on human lives and infrastructure are tremendous, indirect and derivative fire impacts on social and ecological resources can be even more immense, triggering a range of cascading impacts41,42, such as fire impacts on municipal water supplies43, life-threatening post-fire debris flow44 and health implications of fire smoke45,46. Specifically, fire smoke impacted millions of people across the CONUS on an annual basis in recent years, prompting metropolitan areas such as San Francisco and Seattle to experience some of the worst air qualities globally observed. This extends the fire impacts to thousands of kilometres from the fire itself. Fires also directly and indirectly disrupt supply chains47. For example, it was estimated that the 2018 California fires caused a total damage of roughly US$148.2 billion, 59% of which was in the form of indirect losses with cascading impacts in markets outside of California47.\nWe also reveal the growth in infrastructure exposure to fire in the CONUS from 2000 to 2019. Road exposure to fire increased at a rate of 485 km yr\u22121 from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS, a 58% increase in two decades. Roads provide a variety of societal services that are disrupted when they are exposed to fire, with long-lasting impacts that can cascade to other regions, systems and sectors through the supply chain48. Roads also serve as evacuation routes for the impacted population, and fire-induced road closures can lead to population entrapment in the fire perimeter and/or congestion in alternative routes. Furthermore, road networks have not been improved commensurate with the housing growth in the past several decades in the CONUS, causing an increase in the minimum evacuation times49, which, alongside increasingly extreme fire weather conditions that promote rapid fire growth1, leads to escalating fire risks to human lives. For example, in the 2018 Camp Fire\u2014the deadliest fire in California\u2019s history as of writing\u201414 people lost their lives when flames engulfed their cars as they were fleeing the fire40. We also show that powerline exposure to fire increased at a rate of 20 km yr\u22121 from 2000 to 2019 in the CONUS, marking a 70% growth in two decades. Our statistics refer to electricity transmission lines\u2014as opposed to distribution lines\u2014which extend the impacted population and areas far beyond the immediate fire perimeters. We expect the length of electricity distribution lines impacted by fires to be several-fold longer than those of the transmission lines reported here. The exposure of powerlines to fire is associated with a wide range of implications that disrupt the functionality of dependent utilities, facilities and services50. Loss of electricity can, for example, disrupt the communication, water and transportation sectors. These findings warrant a proactive approach to increasing the resilience of fire-prone areas to ensure services are not halted during and after fires.\nOur results also showed an increasing population and infrastructure exposure per unit burned area due to the enhanced collocation of fires and human settlements and infrastructure. This finding challenges the sufficiency of the current paradigm that communicates fire statistics in the scientific literature and to the public in terms of burned areas51. We argue that an impact-based communication of fire statistics is required to prompt adequate mitigation and adaptation efforts at all levels from federal investment to individual behaviour change. Importantly, exacerbating impacts necessitate not only further resources to mitigate risks in all phases of fire disasters but also a more comprehensive attention to the needs of impacted populations and first responders.\nWe posit that an era of fire events unprecedented in the context of contemporary population and infrastructure warrants reimagining the relationship between socio-ecological systems and fire52. This entails the co-evolution of human and ecological systems with preparation and planning for the periods before, during and after fires. This may require reimagining our urban planning and zoning codes53, and adopting marked changes to our landscaping requirements and practices, for example, safe zones around structures54,55. The herein-revealed trends of collocating fires with communities show a grave need for a greater focus on programmes such as FireWise that provide resources to protect homes and neighbourhoods against inevitable wildland fires that spread into the WUI areas. Land management practices, including prescribed fire and managing non-threatening fires to reduce fuel density to sustainable levels, would also contribute to reduced fire risks.\nInfrastructure systems can be improved to avoid exogenous fire ignitions, and road networks can be enhanced for improved, effective and equitable evacuation20. The potential need for fire shelters\u2014similar to tornado, heat and clean-air shelters\u2014can be assessed for remote communities where effective evacuation may be compromised. Additional public education efforts could reduce human ignitions of fires and prepare communities for future fires56. Institutions can be strengthened and resources made available to the most vulnerable populations that are at an increased risk of fire impacts57. Furthermore, fire mitigation, suppression and recovery resources could be increased and reinforced53. Finally, and importantly, moving beyond \u2018basic resilience\u2019, which is rebuilding impacted social and ecological systems to their pre-fire state, to \u2018adaptive and transformative resilience\u2019, which entails transforming systems to embrace fire as a core process57, would help societies cope with future fire events.\nMethods\nWe used annual large-fire-perimeter polygons (that is, shapefiles) between 2000 and 2019 from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS)23 programme. This timeline is selected to be compatible with the available dynamic annual population data (discussed later). MTBS fire perimeters are generated using the differenced normalized burn ratio from post- and pre-fire spectral reflectance in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands from Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 (ref. 23). MTBS provides the perimeters of large fires, defined as larger than 400 ha in the western United States and larger than 200 ha in the eastern United States, from 1984 to the present, with a few years\u2019 latency. We focused on exposure to \u2018wildfires\u2019 by removing the fires that were categorized as \u2018Prescribed Fire\u2019 under \u2018Incid_Type\u2019 or were marked as \u2018Unknown\u2019 under \u2018Incid_Type\u2019 AND \u2018Unnamed\u2019 under \u2018Incid_Name\u2019 in the Burned Areas Boundaries Dataset of MTBS. Unknown and unnamed fires mostly collocate with agricultural lands, pasture lands and grasslands (used for grazing) in which fire is commonly used as a land management tool. Here we adopted the MTBS\u2019s definition of a wildfire as \u201cAn unplanned, unwanted wildland fire including unauthorized human-caused fires, escaped wildland fire use events, escaped prescribed fire projects, and all other wildland fires where the objective is to put the fire out\u201d.\nWe used WorldPop Global Project Population Data with an ~100 \u00d7 100 m resolution that provides annual population distribution from 2000 forward24. WorldPop uses one of the most sophisticated weighting schemes among available gridded population products to disaggregate the total population available for administrative units (for example, US Census) to ~100 \u00d7 100 m grids. In doing so, WorldPop uses a random-forest model with geospatially refined layers of roads, land cover, built structures, cities or urban areas, nighttime lights, infrastructure, environmental data, protected areas and water bodies58. WorldPop offers state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest spatial resolution currently available (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). We deemed this dataset proper for the current study following recommendations58, acknowledging its potential uncertainties. To estimate human exposure to fire, we cropped the population raster based on the fire perimeter layer and summed the populations exposed to fire in each state in each year. In addition, we used vector road data from the TIGER: US Census Roads dataset25 and medium- (10\u201370 kV) and high-voltage (>70 kV) powerline vector data from a previous study.26 TIGER road data provide the shapefiles of roads including \u201cprimary roads, secondary roads, local neighbourhood roads, rural roads, city streets, vehicular trails (4WD), ramps, service drives, walkways, stairways, alleys, and private roads\u201d. We considered both large and small or access roads in our analysis, as fires can impact all road types, precluding them from providing a variety of services and blocking evacuation routes. To estimate road and powerline exposure to fire, we cropped the vector data of roads and powerlines found within the perimeters of fires in each year and estimated the total annual length of road and powerline exposure to fire separately in each state. Note that human population and fire perimeter data are dynamic at an annual scale from 2000 to 2019, but road and powerline data are static for the entire study period.\nWe repeated our analysis of human, road and powerline exposure to fires from 2000 to 2019 for 0.5 km, 1 km, 2.5 km and 5 km buffer zones around the perimeters of fires in each year. The buffer zones provide a rough estimate of the secondary impacts of fires.\nWe considered a counterfactual scenario in which the population distribution is fixed at the level of year 2000 but dynamic annual fire perimeter data are used for exposure assessment. The difference between exposure assessment with a dynamic annual population and this counterfactual scenario determines the contribution of population dynamics to observed trends in human exposure to fires in each state, the western United States, the eastern United States and the CONUS. The western United States is defined as the 11 states in the west of the CONUS. Population dynamics is defined as population growth and migration and includes growth in the WUI.\nFinally, we included population exposure to fires for 2020 and 2021, as fire perimeters for these two years became available during the revision of this paper. This analysis is presented in Supplementary Table 2, but the inclusion of these two years did not change the findings reported in this paper.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe fire-burned-area data are available through the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity programme at https://www.mtbs.gov/index.php/direct-download.

      "text": "Worldwide, an estimated 440 million people were exposed to a wildfire encroaching on their home at some point between 2002 and 2021, new research shows. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to the entire population of the European Union, and the number has been steadily rising \u2013 up 40% over those two decades.\nWith intense, destructive fires often in the news, it can seem like more land is burning. And in parts of the world, including western North America, it is.\nGlobally, however, our team of fire researchers also found that the total area burned actually declined by 26% over those two decades.\nHow is that possible?\nWe found the driving reasons for those changes in Africa, which has the vast majority of all land burned, but the total burned area there has been falling. Agricultural activities in Africa are increasingly fragmenting wildland areas that are prone to burning. A cultivated farm field and roads can help stop a fire\u2019s spread. But more farms and development in wildland areas also means more people can be exposed to wildfires.\nDrawing on our expertise in climate and wildfire sciences and geospatial modeling, we analyzed global wildfire activity over the past two decades. The results highlight some common misperceptions and show how the fire risk to humans is changing.\nGlobal burned area down, intense fires up\nWildfire is a natural process that has existed for as long as vegetation has covered the Earth. Occasional fires in a forest are healthy. They clear out dead wood and leaf and branch litter, leaving less fuel for future fires to burn. That helps to keep wildfires from becoming too intense.\nHowever, intense fires can also pose serious threats to human lives, infrastructure and economies, particularly as more people move into fire-prone areas.\nNorth and South America have both experienced a rise in intense wildfires over the past two decades. Some notable examples include the 2018 Camp Fire in California and the 2023 record-breaking Canadian wildfires, which generated widespread smoke that blanketed large parts of Canada and the eastern United States, and even reached Europe.\nThe increase in intense wildfires aligns with the intensification of fire weather around the world. Heat, low humidity and strong winds can make wildfires more likely to spread and harder to control. The number of days conducive to extreme fire behavior and new fire ignitions has increased by more than 50% over the past four decades globally, elevating the odds that the amount of land burned in a particular region sets a new record.\nBut fire weather is not the only influence on wildfire risk. The amount of dry vegetation, and whether it\u2019s in a continuous stretch or broken up, influences fire risk. So do ignition sources, such as vehicles and power lines in wildland areas. Human activities can start fires and fuel climate change, which further dries out the land, amplifying wildfire activity. Fire suppression practices that don\u2019t allow low-intensity fires to burn can lead to the accumulation of flammable vegetation, raising the risk of intense fires.\nNorth America is a fraction of total burned area\nIn recent years, a growing number of wildfire disasters in North America, Europe and Australia have captured global attention. From the deadly 2025 Los Angeles fires to the devastating 2019-2020 Australian bushfires and the 2018 wildfire in Athens, Greece, flames have increasingly encroached upon human settlements, claiming lives and livelihoods.\nHowever, wildfire exposure isn\u2019t limited to these high-profile regions \u2212 we simply hear more about them.\nThe United States, Europe and Australia collectively account for less than 2.5% of global human exposure to wildfire. Human exposure to fire occurs when people\u2019s homes fall directly within the area burned by a wildfire.\nIn stark contrast, Africa alone accounts for approximately 85% of all wildfire exposures and 65% of the global burned area.\nRemarkably, just five central African countries \u2013 the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola \u2013 experience half of all global human exposure to wildfires, even though they account for less than 3% of the global population. These countries receive sufficient moisture to support plant growth, yet they are dry enough that trees and plants burn in frequent fires that in some places occur multiple times per year.\nRegional trends and drivers of wildfire\nWe found that wildfire exposure increased across all continents except Europe and Oceania, but the underlying drivers of the increase varied by region.\nIn Africa, agricultural expansion has led to more people living in fire-prone areas.\nIn North America, particularly the United States, intensifying fire weather \u2013 the hot, dry, windy conditions conducive to spreading fires \u2013 has led to increasingly uncontrollable wildfires that threaten human settlements.\nIn South America, a combination of rising drought frequency and severity, intensifying heat waves and agricultural expansion has amplified wildfire intensity and increased the population in fire-prone regions.\nIn Asia, growing populations in fire-prone areas, combined with more days of fire-friendly weather, led to increased human exposure to wildfires.\nIn contrast, Europe and Oceania have seen declining wildfire exposures, largely due to more people moving to cities and fewer living in rural, fire-prone zones.\nWhat to do about it\nCommunities can take steps to prevent destructive wildfires from spreading.\nFor example, vegetation management, such as prescribed fires, can avoid fueling intense fires. Public education, policy enforcement and engineering solutions \u2013 such as vegetation reduction and clearance along roads and power lines \u2013 can help reduce human-caused ignitions.\nAs climate change intensifies fire weather and people continue to move into fire-prone zones, proactive mitigation will be increasingly critical."

      "text": "Abstract\nClimate change is exacerbating wildfire conditions, but evidence is lacking for global trends in extreme fire activity itself. Here we identify energetically extreme wildfire events by calculating daily clusters of summed fire radiative power using 21 years of satellite data, revealing that the frequency of extreme events (\u226599.99th percentile) increased by 2.2-fold from 2003 to 2023, with the last 7 years including the 6 most extreme. Although the total area burned on Earth may be declining, our study highlights that fire behaviour is worsening in several regions\u2014particularly the boreal and temperate conifer biomes\u2014with substantial implications for carbon storage and human exposure to wildfire disasters.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nExtreme wildfires are sporadic features of fire-prone landscapes globally1, and they carry major ecological, economic and social consequences. Australia\u2019s \u2018Black Summer Bushfires\u2019 of 2019 and 2020, for example, were unprecedented in their scale and intensity (measured as radiative power)2. These energetically extreme fires released extraordinary quantities of carbon emissions and smoke3,4, killed an estimated ~2.8 billion vertebrates5 and burned the entire geographic ranges of 116 plant species6. The 2015 wildfires in Indonesia likewise had major social and economic effects: densely populated cities of southeast Asia were blanketed with smog, leading to an estimated 100,000 additional deaths from smoke-related respiratory problems7 and causing an estimated US$16 billion in direct and indirect economic losses8.\nMost fires on Earth are small9, ignited by humans10, and not remarkably damaging. Indeed, fire plays a crucial role in the health of most fire-adapted ecosystems11. It has been widely reported that the area burned globally has decreased this century12,13,14,15,16, but this trend is mostly driven by declines in low-intensity fires in African grasslands and savannas13,16. Globally, average fire intensity has also been decreasing this century (with some regional increases)15, but burn severity, an ecological measure of a fire\u2019s immediate effects (for example, biomass loss and mortality), is increasing in more regions than it is decreasing14.\nIn contrast to the majority of fires, energetically extreme wildfires are associated with extreme ecological, social and economic consequences1, including emitting vast quantities of smoke and greenhouse gases that threaten to further accelerate warming3,4. Despite their importance, there remains no systematic evidence of temporal trends in extreme wildfires. In a study of energetically extreme wildfires1, no temporal trend was revealed, potentially because of the relatively short satellite record used in the study (12 years, 2002\u20132013). Likewise, global trends have not yet been observed for pyrocumulonimbus events (storms triggered by extremely intense wildfires)17. A lack of trends is unexpected because warming temperatures and increasing vapour pressure deficit are drying fuels and worsening fire weather across most of the Earth18,19,20,21,22,23. Climate change has already caused fire weather to depart from its historical variability across ~20% of burnable land area globally24, and recent extremely destructive wildfire seasons have occurred in the Amazon25, Australia2, Canada26, Chile27, Portugal28, Indonesia8, Siberia and the western United States19,29. While the notion of increasingly dangerous wildfires pervades the media, such trends have not been systematically shown30.\nHere we use 21 years of satellite observations of the radiative power released by wildfires to evaluate whether energetically extreme wildfire events are increasing in frequency and/or magnitude. We use a similar approach to ref. 1 by calculating the daily summed fire radiative power (FRP; megawatts) of clusters of active fire hotspots observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Aqua satellites31. To do this, we summed the FRP (\u03a3FRP) of hotspots in a 0.2\u00b0 equal-area lattice across the Earth for each of the 7,639 days between 1 January 2003 and 30 November 2023. As distinct from analysing the FRP of individual hotspots, which measure the intensity of a fire at a single time and location, our daily \u03a3FRP approach characterizes the integrated radiant energy released by broader fire \u2018events\u2019 that may burn concurrently at multiple nearby locations and at multiple time points during the day, thus distinguishing energetically extreme fires from energetically extreme hotspots. This process reduced 88.4 million satellite observations to 30.7 million daily \u03a3FRP events. We then evaluated temporal trends and biogeographic associations in the most extreme of these events, defined here as those exceeding the 99.99th percentile of daily \u03a3FRP. This process identified 2,913 extreme events (of which 13% were associated with fires burning in the same cell within the subsequent 7 days).\nThe frequency of extreme wildfire events increased by a model-estimated 2.2-fold over the 21-year study period (Fig. 1b; Pf(year) = 0.00003, estimated degrees of freedom (edf) = 2, \u03c72 statistic = 18.4). Extreme events occurred on all continents except Antarctica (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1). The six most extreme years with respect to the frequency of major events occurred from 2017 onwards (Fig. 1b). This increasing trend was apparent for \u03a3FRP calculated using day and night hotspots separately (Fig. 1b), but there was stronger statistical evidence of an increasing trend at night-time (Pf(year) = 0.00006, edf = 1.84, \u03c72 = 16.65) than at daytime (Pf(year) = 0.003, edf = 1.68, \u03c72 = 8.98). The stronger increasing trend at night is in line with the observation that temperatures are warming faster at night than during the day32, and such warming is consequently reducing the night-time barrier to wildfire33.\nIn addition to the increasing frequency of extreme wildfire events, the magnitude of extreme wildfire events has also increased significantly. For the 20 most extreme events in each year, the average \u03a3FRP has similarly increased by 2.3-fold over the study, and this increase appears to be accelerating (Fig. 1c; Pf(year) = 0.00003, edf = 1.96, F statistic = 3.88). Like the frequency of extreme events, the 6 most extreme years with respect to magnitude occurred within the last 7 years (Fig. 1c).\nRelative to the area occupied by the Earth\u2019s biogeographic realms and biomes, extreme events were disproportionately concentrated in the Nearctic and Australasia/Oceania realms (ratios > 1; Fig. 2a)34 and in the temperate conifer forest, Mediterranean forest/woodland, and boreal forest biomes (Fig. 2b). Biome-specific generalized linear models revealed that the global increase in extreme events was almost entirely driven by strong increases in the temperate conifer forest biome (Pyear = 0.00002, z statistic = 4.28) and the boreal forests and taiga biome (Fig. 2c; Pyear = 0.000003, z = 4.64). In the temperate conifer forest biome, the annual number of extreme events estimated by a generalized linear model increased by 11.1-fold, from 6 in 2003 to 67 in 2023 (Fig. 2c). Similarly, extreme events in the boreal forest biome increased by 7.3-fold, from a model-estimated 14.9 to 108.7, over the 21 years of the study (Fig. 2c). No significant trends were apparent in other biomes (Fig. 2c). The increasing trends in the boreal forest and temperate conifer forest biomes are in line with documented increases in mean FRP in those regions15.\nThe frequency of extreme events has increased exponentially in the temperate conifer forests of the American West and the boreal forest of North America and Russia (Fig. 2c). Recent extreme fire years in the western United States have been characterized by extremely low fuel moisture over very broad areas35. Such increasing fuel aridity has been linked to an exponential increase in burned area because aridity promotes fire growth, and the potential for rapid growth increases as fires get larger36. Increasing fuel aridity caused by anthropogenic climate change has driven more than half of the increase in the extent of forest fire in the western United States between 1979 and 201523, and simulations suggest that fuel limitations from fire-fuel feedbacks are unlikely to significantly quell the trajectory37. Similar trends between anomalous area burnt and fuel dryness have also been observed in southeast Australia2,19.\nDespite the importance of extreme wildfire events, research has not yet, to our knowledge, revealed global trends in frequency or magnitude19. This is probably due in part to the relatively short period over which satellites have observed FRP1. Short time series (9 years, 2013\u20132021) have similarly impeded the discovery of trends in extreme fire-induced pyrocumulonimbus storms17, but a lack of evidence due to data deficiencies does not imply an absence of trends.\nThe previous lack of documented trends in extreme wildfires also probably stems from the dominant focus of the literature on burned area. Many studies, for example, report that the global burned area has decreased this century (for example, refs. 12,13,14,15,16), leading policy commentators to question the reality of worsening wildfire disasters (for example, ref. 38). Yet, as most fires are human ignited and have relatively small impacts, a focus on average intensities and global burned area means that such analyses are swamped by relatively low-impact fires, including fire used for habitat management, pastoralism, agriculture and silviculture39,40. A focus on global averages disproportionately weights Africa (67% of burned area) and conceals opposing trends in different regions16. Importantly, a focus on average intensities obscures the extreme events\u2014those that cause the most damage and release the most emissions. By characterizing the daily integrated radiant energy released by fires, we contend that the \u03a3FRP approach used here provides a vital measure of the way in which fire behaviour is responding to climate change.\nOur results show that events of extreme intensity have more than doubled in frequency and magnitude, with increases largely concentrated in the carbon-rich41 boreal and temperate conifer forests of the northern hemisphere. There were also several foci of extreme events in the southern hemisphere (southern Africa, Australia and South America). The last 7 years included the six most extreme years for energetically extreme wildfires. The most recent year (2023) had both the hottest global temperature on record42 and the most extreme wildfire intensities (Fig. 1c) since MODIS sensors began observing wildfires. The increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme wildfire events is in step with global heating, highlighting the urgency with which we must adapt to a climate that is more conducive to extreme wildfires.\nMethods\nIdentifying energetically extreme wildfire events\nThe MODIS sensors on NASA\u2019s Terra and Aqua satellites identify active wildfires based on thermal anomalies. The MCD14ML product43 provides point locations of wildfire \u2018hotspots\u2019 at a resolution of 1 km. These locations represent the centre of a 1 km pixel that was identified by the fire and thermal anomaly algorithm as containing at least one fire somewhere within the pixel, thus detecting fires substantially smaller than a pixel44. We excluded locations labelled as probably resulting from non-fire sources, such as volcanoes, other static sources or offshore (for example, industrial). For additional robustness, we further filtered out \u2018low confidence\u2019 fires (that is, confidence <30 (ref. 45)). Each fire observation is accompanied by a measure of FRP, measuring the instantaneous fire energy (megawatts) emitted by a fire, which is known to scale to smoke plume size46 and has been widely used as a proxy of fire intensity1. The Terra satellite provides daily equatorial overpasses at approximately 10:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m., and the Aqua satellite at 1:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., allowing separate investigations of trends in daytime and night-time fires.\nPolar-orbiting satellites are biased at high latitudes because there is some overlap in the swaths of adjacent satellite overpasses47, leading to the possibility that the same pixel is double counted in subsequent orbits. We corrected this problem by identifying and omitting likely duplicate hotspots, similar to the approach of a previous study48. For the Terra and Aqua satellites, there should each be a maximum of one hotspot for each day and each night in each pixel. Thus, to identify likely duplicates, we identified pixels with multiple observations in a given day or night at a resolution of 500 m. Such cases with multiple hotspots indicate a likely duplicate, in which cases we retained one hotspot at random, leaving a combined maximum of four hotspots per 24 h period in each location. Of a total dataset of 88.4 million hotspots, this cleaning process removed 176,181 (0.19%) likely duplicates.\nThe Terra satellite began collecting data in February 200044 but suffered from hardware problems before November 200045. The Aqua satellite was launched later and began collecting data in June 200244. We chose to analyse the full combined Terra and Aqua datasets to provide the fullest characterization of fires over the course of a day. Thus, because of the lower sampling effort before 2003, we based our primary analysis on the years 2003\u20132023. However, see Supplementary Fig. 1 for a comparison of the trends shown by Terra (2001\u20132023) and Aqua (2003\u20132023), revealing similar trends in both satellites.\nTo identify energetically extreme wildfire events, we calculated the daily energy released by wildfires using an equal-area, equal-shape global lattice with a 0.2\u00b0 resolution, equating to cell sizes of approximately 22 \u00d7 22 km (~495 km2). We selected this scale as an ecologically reasonable but computationally tractable scale for analysing large volumes of daily satellite data at a global scale. For each cell, we summed the FRP (\u03a3FRP) of hotspots for each of the 7,639 days between 1 January 2003 and 30 November 2023. At the time of writing, scientific-quality observations were not yet available for December 2023, thus providing a partial and conservative record of the number of extreme events in 2023. This process yielded 30.7 million daily \u03a3FRP \u2018events\u2019 from 88.4 million hotspot observations. Because it has been reported that global warming is leading to warmer and drier air at night, in turn weakening the night-time barrier to fire33, we repeated the \u03a3FRP aggregation process for daytime and night-time fires separately to investigate whether trends differed during day and night.\nAfter calculating the \u03a3FRP events, we then selected the most energetically extreme events for subsequent analysis, defined here as events with \u03a3FRP \u2265 99.99th percentile (N = 2,913 events). Although this threshold itself is arbitrary, it unambiguously captures fires of extreme integrated radiant power output, does so in a systematic and unbiased fashion, and yields a reasonable sample size for subsequent analyses. All analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.0 (ref. 49).\nTemporal and biogeographic trends in extreme wildfires\nTo characterize the biogeographic patterns in extreme events, we calculated the area-normalized ratio of extreme events among the biogeographical realms and biomes of the Earth. Biogeographical realms and biomes are described in ref. 34. To calculate the ratio, we divided the proportion of extreme events occurring in each realm and biome by the proportion of the Earth\u2019s land area occupied by those regions (excluding Antarctica). If extreme events occurred randomly, we would expect ratios of approximately one; values substantially larger than one indicate extreme events are disproportionately common, and values less than one indicate extreme events are disproportionately rare.\nTo evaluate temporal trends in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events, we fit separate statistical models that investigate (1) the frequency of extreme events globally, (2) the frequency of extreme events among biomes and (3) the magnitude of extreme events globally. In all models, we interpreted P values as continuous rather than categorical measures of the strength of evidence, as previously advocated50.\nFirst, we fit a generalized additive model (GAM) of the annual count of extreme events in response to a smooth (that is, nonlinear) effect of year (continuous variable; 2003\u20132023)51. GAMs allow fitting of nonlinear effects if supported by the data. We fit the model using automatic term selection (\u2018select = TRUE\u2019) available in the \u2018mgcv\u2019 package51, which imposes an additional penalty on smooth terms such that they are penalized out of the model if there is little evidence for an effect. We fit the model using the negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion52. We followed the same process to model the trend for day \u03a3FRP and night \u03a3FRP separately.\nSecond, we fit separate generalized linear models for each of the six biomes with the largest number of events (providing a reasonable sample to interrogate for trends). We fit these models with the annual count of extreme events modelled in response to a fixed effect of year, using the negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion52.\nThird, to investigate trends in the magnitude of the most extreme events, we selected the 20 most extreme events from each year, from which we calculated the annual average of extreme \u03a3FRP. We then modelled the annual average of extreme \u03a3FRP in response to a nonlinear effect of \u2018year\u2019 using a GAM with Gaussian distribution. Generalized linear models and GAMs were fit using the \u2018mgcv\u2019 package (version 1.8\u201342)51.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nMODIS active fire records used in the analysis were downloaded from the University of Maryland ftp server (sftp://fuoco.geog.umd.edu) and are available via figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25132151 (ref. 53).

      "text": "The worst wildfire to hit Greece in over a decade tore through a small resort town near Athens on Monday afternoon, killing at least 74 people, injuring almost 200 and forcing hundreds more to rush on to beaches and into the sea as the blaze devoured houses and cars.\nHuge, fast-moving flames trapped families with children as they tried to flee from Mati, 18 miles (29km) east of the Greek capital. Among the dead were 26 people whose bodies were found huddled tightly together close to the beach, a Red Cross official said on Tuesday morning.\nIt was the country\u2019s deadliest fire since blazes raged across the southern Peloponnese peninsula in August 2007, killing dozens of people.\nThe Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said a state of emergency had been declared in the Attica region, which includes Athens, and ordered three days of national mourning.\n\u201cGreece is going through an unspeakable tragedy,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let mourning overwhelm us, because these hours are hours of battle, unity, courage and above all solidarity.\u201d\nAs Greece tried to come to terms with what one civil protection agency official described as \u201ca national tragedy\u201d, the country activated an EU agreement to request help from fellow member states.\nA military transport plane with 60 firefighters on board flew out of Cyprus, Spain dispatched two water-dropping planes and other countries, including Turkey, Israel and Italy, offered to send planes and helicopters.\n\u201cEurope will stand by our Greek friends in these difficult times,\u201d tweeted Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council. \u201cHelp is on its way from several EU countries.\u201d\nDetails of the fates of some of those who had perished emerged as Tuesday wore on.\nThe 26 who died close to the beach \u201chad tried to find an escape route but didn\u2019t make it in time,\u201d Nikos Economopoulos, the head of Greece\u2019s Red Cross, told the country\u2019s Skai TV. \u201cInstinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced.\u201d\nA fire brigade spokesman said at least 74 people had died. The toll was expected to rise as rescue crews searched through the charred remains of houses.\nThe government said at least 172 people were hurt, including 16 children, and 11 adults were in a serious condition. The Greek coastguard said the bodies of four people were retrieved from the sea off Mati.\nBut there were also stories of remarkable rescues: coastguards and others saved 696 people who had fled to beaches, while boats pulled another 19 people alive from the sea.\nThe town they had left behind had been gutted. Many hours after the blaze broke out, the strong smell of charred buildings and trees lingered in the air. White smoke rose from smouldering fires.\n\u201cMati doesn\u2019t even exist as a settlement any more,\u201d one woman told Skai TV. \u201cI saw corpses, burnt-out cars. I feel lucky to be alive.\u201d\nMati is in the Rafina region, which is popular with local tourists, particularly older people and children at holiday camps.\n\u201cI personally saw at least 100 homes in flames,\u201d said Evangelos Bournous, the mayor of the Rafina-Pikermi area. \u201cI saw it with my eyes, it is a total catastrophe.\u201d\nNine coastal patrol boats, two military vessels and dozens of private boats were mobilised to help people stuck in Rafina harbour. Police said they found two Danish tourists in a boat off the Rafina coast. Another eight people from the group were missing.\nNikos Stavrinidis said he had lost two friends in the waters off Rafina port, after the group he was with sprinted into the sea when they saw the flames approaching.\n\u201cIt happened very fast,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cThe fire was in the distance, then sparks from the fire reached us. Then the fire was all around us. The wind was indescribable.\u201d\nYannis Stratikopoulos of the civil protection agency, said efforts to fight the blazes would continue until they were brought under control. Although he said it was too early to speculate on what had caused the fires, he rejected suggestions that the emergency response had been badly coordinated.\nOn Monday, Greek authorities had urged residents of a coastal region west of Athens to abandon their homes as another wildfire burned ferociously, closing one of Greece\u2019s busiest motorways, halting train links and sending plumes of smoke over the capital.\nFirefighters and equipment from across Greece were deployed to deal with the blaze at Kineta, a small resort town about 35 miles west of the capital on a route used daily by tens of thousands of drivers to reach the Peloponnese peninsula.\nStrong winds fanned towering walls of flames stretching as wide as four miles near Kineta, local officials said. Dozens of homes were thought to have been damaged or destroyed by the blaze.\nCriticism of the rescue operation was mounting on Tuesday, as locals in and around Mati claimed officials had misjudged the ferocity of the fires and focused on the blazes around Kineta when another much greater inferno was raging in the eastern resort area.\nOne resident, identified as Christina, told Thema 104.6 radio that the authorities had been badly organised. \u201cThere was no plan. Not a drop of water was thrown on the flames here because they were only concentrated on western Attica. That is why people burned. No one was informed by anyone,\u201d said the woman.\nAlmost 50 brush and forest fires broke out across Greece on Monday and early Tuesday, with most of them quickly extinguished, the fire department said. Ten were still burning late on Tuesday morning, including blazes in Corinth, Crete and in central and northern Greece.\nAreas around Athens were like a tinderbox, emergency workers said, after a dry winter and a summer heatwave in which temperatures have risen above 40C. However, heavy rain was forecast across southern Greece on Wednesday."

      "text": "In the U.S., wildland firefighters are able to stop about 98% of all wildfires before the fires have burned even 100 acres. That may seem comforting, but decades of quickly suppressing fires has had unintended consequences.\nFires are a natural part of many landscapes globally. When forests aren\u2019t allowed to burn, they become more dense, and dead branches, leaves and other biomass accumulate, leaving more fuel for the next fire. This buildup leads to more extreme fires that are even harder to put out. That\u2019s why land managers set controlled burns and thin forests to clear out the undergrowth.\nHowever, fuel accumulation isn\u2019t the only consequence of fire suppression.\nFire suppression also disproportionately reduces certain types of fire. In a new study, my colleagues and I show how this effect, known as the suppression bias, compounds the impacts of fuel accumulation and climate change.\nWhat happened to all the low-intensity fires?\nMost wildfires are low-intensity. They ignite when conditions aren\u2019t too dry or windy, and they can often be quickly extinguished.\nThe 2% of fires that escape suppression are those that are more extreme and much harder to fight. They account for about 98% of the burned area in a typical year.\nIn other words, trying to put out all wildfires doesn\u2019t reduce the total amount of fire equally \u2013 instead, it limits low-intensity fires while extreme fires still burn. This effect is worsened by climate change.\nToo much suppression makes fires more severe\nIn our study, we used a fire modeling simulation to explore the effects of the fire suppression bias and see how they compared to the effects of global warming and fuel accumulation alone.\nFuel accumulation and global warming both inherently make fires more severe. But over thousands of simulated fires, we found that allowing forests to burn only under the very worst conditions increased fire severity by the same amount as more than a century\u2019s worth of fuel accumulation or 21st-century climate change.\nThe suppression bias also changes the way plants and animals interact with fire.\nBy removing low-intensity fires, humans may be changing the course of evolution. Without exposure to low-intensity fires, species can lose traits crucial for surviving and recovering from such events.\nAfter extreme fires, landscapes have fewer seed sources and less shade. New seedlings have a harder time becoming established, and for those that do, the hotter and drier conditions reduce their chance of survival.\nIn contrast, low-intensity fires free up space and resources for new growth, while still retaining living trees and other biological legacies that support seedlings in their vulnerable initial years.\nBy quickly putting out low-intensity fires and allowing only extreme fires to burn, conventional suppression reduces the opportunities for climate-adapted plants to establish and help ecosystems adjust to changes like global warming.\nSuppression makes burned area increase faster\nAs the climate becomes hotter and drier, more area is burning in wildfires. If suppression removes fire, it should help slow this increase, right?\nIn fact, we found it does just the opposite.\nWe found that while conventional suppression led to less total area burning, the yearly burned area increased more than three times faster under conventional suppression than under less aggressive suppression efforts. The amount of area burned doubled every 14 years with conventional fire suppression under simulated climate change, instead of every 44 years when low- and moderate-intensity fires were allowed to burn. That raises concerns for how quickly people and ecosystems will have to adapt to extreme fires in the future.\nThe fact that the amount of area burned is increasing is undoubtedly driven by climate change. But our study shows that the rate of this increase may also be a result of conventional fire management.\nThe near total suppression of fires over the last century means that even a little additional fire in a more fire-prone future can create big changes. As climate change continues to fuel more fires, the relative increase in area burned will be much bigger.\nThis puts more stress on communities as they adapt to increased extreme wildfires, from dealing with more wildfire smoke to even changing where people can live.\nA way forward\nTo address the wildfire crisis, fire managers can be less aggressive in suppressing low- and moderate-intensity fires when it is safe to do so. They can also increase the use of prescribed fire and cultural burning to clear away brush and other fuel for fires.\nThese low-intensity fires will not only reduce the risk of future extreme fires, but they also will create conditions that favor the establishment of species better suited to the changing climate, thereby helping ecosystems adapt to global warming.\nCoexisting with wildfire requires developing technologies and approaches that enable the safe management of wildfires under moderate burning conditions. Our study shows that this may be just as necessary as other interventions, such as reducing the number of fires unintentionally started by human activities and mitigating climate change."

      "text": "Investigators are trying to determine what caused several wind-driven wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes across the Los Angeles area in January 2025. Given the fires\u2019 locations, and lack of lightning at the time, it\u2019s likely that utility infrastructure, other equipment or human activities were involved.\nCalifornia\u2019s wildfires have become increasingly destructive in recent years. Research my colleagues and I have conducted shows U.S. wildfires are up to four times larger and three times more frequent than they were in the 1980s and \u201990s. Fast-moving fires have been particularly destructive, accounting for 78% of structures destroyed and 61% of suppression costs between 2001 and 2020.\nLightning strikes are a common cause of U.S. wildfires, but the majority of wildfires that threaten communities are started by human activities.\nA broken power line started the deadly 2023 Maui fire that destroyed the town of Lahaina, Hawaii. Metal from cars or mowers dragging on the ground can spark fires. California\u2019s largest fire in 2024 started when a man pushed a burning car into a ravine near Chico. The fire destroyed more than 700 homes and buildings.\nWhat makes these wildfires so destructive and difficult to contain?\nThe answer lies in a mix of wind speed, changing climate, the legacy of past land-management practices, and current human activities that are reshaping fire behavior and increasing the risk they pose.\nFire\u2019s perfect storm\nWildfires rely on three key elements to spread: conducive weather, dry fuel and an ignition source. Each of these factors has undergone pronounced changes in recent decades. While climate change sets the stage for larger and more intense fires, humans are actively fanning the flames.\nClimate and weather\nExtreme temperatures play a dangerous role in wildfires. Heat dries out vegetation, making it more flammable. Under these conditions, wildfires ignite more easily, spread faster and burn with greater intensity. In the western U.S., aridity attributed to climate change has doubled the amount of forestland that has burned since 1984.\nCompounding the problem is the rapid rise in nighttime temperatures, now increasing faster than daytime temperatures. Nights, which used to offer a reprieve with cooler conditions and higher humidity, do so less often, allowing fires to continue raging without pause.\nFinally, winds contribute to the rapid expansion, increased intensity and erratic behavior of wildfires. Wind gusts push heat and embers ahead of the fire front and can cause it to rapidly expand. They can also create spot fires in new locations. Additionally, winds enhance combustion by supplying more oxygen, which can make the fire more unpredictable and challenging to control. Usually driven by high winds, fast-moving fires have become more frequent in recent decades.\nFuel\nFire is a natural process that has shaped ecosystems for over 420 million years. Indigenous people historically used controlled burns to manage landscapes and reduce fuel buildup. However, a century of fire suppression has allowed vast areas to accumulate dense fuels, priming them for larger and more intense wildfires.\nInvasive species, such as certain grasses, have exacerbated the issue by creating continuous fuel beds that accelerate fire spread, often doubling or tripling fire activity.\nAdditionally, human development in fire-prone regions, especially in the wildland-urban interface, where neighborhoods intermingle with forest and grassland vegetation, has introduced new, highly flammable fuels. Buildings, vehicles and infrastructure often ignite easily and burn hotter and faster than natural vegetation. These changes have significantly altered fuel patterns, creating conditions conducive to more severe and harder-to-control wildfires.\nIgnition\nLightning can ignite wildfires, but humans are responsible for an increasing share. From unattended campfires to arson or sparks from power lines, over 84% of the wildfires affecting communities are human-ignited.\nHuman activities have not only tripled the length of the fire season, but they also have resulted in fires that pose a higher risk to people.\nLightning-started fires often coincide with storms that carry rain or higher humidity, which slows fires\u2019 spread. Human-started fires, however, typically ignite under more extreme conditions \u2013 hotter temperatures, lower humidity and stronger winds. This leads to greater flame heights, faster spread in the critical early days before crews can respond, and more severe ecosystem effects, such as killing more trees and degrading the soil.\nHuman-ignited fires often occur in or near populated areas, where flammable structures and vegetation create even more hazardous conditions. Homes and the materials around them, such as wooden fences and porches, can burn quickly and send burning embers airborne, further spreading the flames.\nAs urban development expands into wildlands, the probability of human-started fires and the property potentially exposed to fire increase, creating a feedback loop of escalating wildfire risk.\nWhiplash weather\nA phenomenon known as whiplash weather, marked by unusually wet winters and springs followed by extreme summer heat, was especially pronounced in Southern California in recent years.\nA wet spring in 2024 fostered vegetation growth, which then dried out under scorching summer temperatures, turning into highly combustible fuel. This cycle fueled some of the biggest fires of the 2024 season, several of which were started by humans.\nThat dryness continued in Southern California through the fall and into early winter, with very little rainfall. Soil moisture in the Los Angeles region was about 2% of historical levels for that time of year when the fires began on Jan. 7, 2025.\nAs the factors that can drive wildfires converge, the potential for increasingly severe wildfires looms ever larger. Severe fires also release large amounts of carbon from trees, vegetation and soils into the atmosphere, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating climate change, contributing to more extreme fire seasons.\nThis is an update to an article originally published Oct. 8, 2024."

      "text": "Abstract\nRegions across the globe have experienced devastating fire years in the past decade with far-reaching impacts. Here, we examine the role of antecedent and concurrent climate variability in enabling extreme regional fire years across global forests. These extreme years commonly coincided with extreme (1-in-15-year) fire weather indices (FWI) and featured a four and five-fold increase in the number of large fires and fire carbon emissions, respectively, compared with non-extreme years. Years with such extreme FWI metrics are 88-152% more likely across global forested lands under a contemporary (2011\u20132040) climate compared to a quasi-preindustrial (1851\u20131900) climate, with the most pronounced increased risk in temperate and Amazonian forests. Our results show that human-caused climate change is raising the odds of extreme climate-driven fire years across forested regions of the globe, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate risks and adapt to extreme fire years.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nThe impacts of fires on society and the environment have received growing scientific and public attention over the past decade. This increased recognition stems not only from the complexity of fire in the Earth system1,2 but also from the occurrence of extreme fire years\u2014categorized as years with widespread regional fire activity and exceptional burned area. Such extreme fire years include 2019\u20132020 in Australia3, 2020 in the western US4, as well as 2023 in Canada5. While individual fires\u2014such as those associated with widespread losses\u2014have garnered immediate media attention6, extreme fire years have broader implications. These extreme and often prolonged and widespread fire years impact air quality1, elevate carbon emissions7, overextend social support infrastructure8 and challenge international coordination of fire suppression resource9.\nWhile global burned area has declined in recent decades due to land-use change in fire-frequent savannas10, burned area and fire carbon emissions have increased in the world\u2019s forested biomes11,12. Increases in fire activity have been pronounced in places where increased fire weather13 and longer fire weather seasons14 coincide with fuel-rich, flammability-limited lands such as the western United States, Canada, and Siberia15,16. Both longer and more intense periods of fire weather have facilitated increased geographic synchronization in fire weather, which can overwhelm fire suppression capabilities17,18. Complementary to changing biophysical factors that influence fire potential, local-to-regional anthropogenic actions have affected trajectories of fire activity. The legacy effects of a century of fire suppression and agricultural land abandonment have increased fuel loads and fuel continuity in some regions that predispose landscapes to larger, more energetic fires19. Contemporary fire suppression also largely constrains burned area in some regions to primarily occurring under extreme fire weather conditions\u2014augmenting the sensitivity of fire to climate drivers20. In tropical forests, deforestation occurs to make space for globalized industrial agriculture\u2014resulting in an economic catalyst to regional fire activity that becomes more prominent during drought years21.\nA growing body of attribution research has examined the role of anthropogenic climate change on22,23 fire activity, whether measured in burned area22,23,24, through extreme fire typologies25, or specific extreme fire events26,27,28. Such research generally isolates the contributions of climate factors, even though fire responses (e.g., burned area) depend on a complex interplay of social, biological, and physical drivers that may confound direct climate attribution29. These studies typically, but not always26, show that human-induced climate change has augmented the likelihood or magnitude of fire weather extremes and fire potential. Yet, most of these efforts have been constrained geographically to specific case study regions and used different methods, limiting the ability to quantitatively compare the role that human-caused climate change has played in fires across geographies. Conversely, at the global scale, most prior climate-fire analyses have focused on correlative assessments of intra-to-interannual variability2,16, or on individual extreme fire events occurring on the scale of weeks to months30,31, but not extreme fire years.\nHere, we analyze the role of fire weather in enabling extreme fire years across forested ecoregions of the world and quantify the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to those extreme years. We first identify commonalities in both fire weather indices and antecedent moisture in these extreme regional fire years using representative case study regions across major forest biomes32 alongside a systematic analysis of forested ecoregions worldwide. Our analysis is limited to predominantly forest and woodland areas, where fire produces significant carbon and smoke and where climate-fire relationships are more clearly coupled due to the absence of fuel limitations16,32. While a singular definition of extreme in fire science is absent31,33,34, herein we adopt the term \u201cextreme fire years\u201d as the year with the greatest amount of burned area in MODIS record (2002\u20132023) for a given region. Leveraging this empirical analysis of observed extreme regional fire years, we systematically apply an attribution framework to quantify how anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability of climate-enabled extreme fire years in forested regions globally.\nResults\nConditions underpinning extreme fire years in case studies\nExtreme regional fire years generally coincided with exceptional or record high fire weather, quantified by the Fire Weather Index (FWI, calculated from the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System) for our case study regions (Table 1; Fig. 1c). Notably, FWI metrics including the number of days per year above the 95th percentile (FWI95d), the maximum 90-day moving average FWI (FWIfs), and the annual maximum FWI (FWImax) were at their highest values during the 1979\u20132023 period for extreme fire years in the western US in 2020, Canada in 2023, SE Australia in 2019\u201320, Chile in 2022\u20132023, and Siberia in 2012. All case study regions except the Amazon and SE Asia regions had FWI metrics exceeding the 1-in-15 return period during the record fire year\u2014codified with a generalized extreme value (GEV) approach using data from a 1979\u20132023 baseline\u2014suggestive of the role of climate variability in enabling and driving extreme fire years (Figs. S1 and S3). While extreme fire years in the Amazon and SE Asia regions occurred with moderate FWI and drought, these years were strongly influenced by deforestation and land clearing fires\u2014which occurred earlier in the study period and have waned over the past couple decades (Fig. 1b; Table 1).\nInterannual relationships between forested burned area and FWI metrics showed moderate-to-strong positive correlations, suggesting flammability-limited fire regimes (Figs. S1\u2013S3). By contrast, variation in moisture availability (precipitation or evapotranspiration) in the previous 1\u20132 years did not correlate significantly with forested burned area (Figs. S4 and S5). Moisture availability was not particularly anomalous prior to the most extreme fire years (Fig. 1c), except in Chile, where very low precipitation was seen a year prior to the most extreme fire year.\nThe total number of fires and the number of very large fires (\u2265100 km2) were anomalously high during extreme fire years in these case study regions. Most regions had at least three times as many very large fires during extreme fire years as the average of other years (Table 1), with six of the eight regions having the most or second most on record. Likewise, extreme fire years typically coincided with the years with the highest fire carbon emissions (e.g., carbon emissions during the 2019\u201320 fire year in SE Australia were comparable to the sum of all remaining years during 2002\u20132023). The impacts from these extreme regional fire years included widespread hazardous air quality, direct toll on human life and infrastructure, economic losses, and widespread ecosystem impacts (Table 1).\nExtreme fire years across forested ecoregions typically coincide with extreme fire weather\nAcross forested ecoregions globally, extreme fire years generally coincided with high-to-record FWI metrics, like our case studies (Fig. 2). Extreme regional fire years often occurred in years with extreme FWI (ecoregion median GEV found 1-in-15-years for FWIfs, 1-in-12-years for FWI95d and 1-in-9-years for FWImax). Extreme fire years coinciding with more moderate FWI years were typically located in tropical regions subject to deforestation impacts. By contrast, return intervals for anomalously high precipitation and evapotranspiration from the prior one to two years exhibited comparatively little signal (Fig. S6a, b, e, f), suggestive of negligible generalizable influence of increased fuel load enabling extreme fire years. Likewise, GEV analyses of annual precipitation and evapotranspiration during the prior one to two years show no commonality of extreme longer-term drought beyond the fire year in facilitating extreme regional fire years (Fig. S6c, d, g, h). We adopted the 1-in-15-year FWI in our attribution exercise, given that extreme fire years in six of the eight case studies and a third of forested global ecoregions exceeded this return interval for all FWI metrics.\nIn most ecoregions, forested burned area during the most extreme fire year was at least five times larger than the average for non-extreme years (Fig. 1a). Like results for the case studies, extreme fire years at ecoregion scales were associated with increased fire occurrence (73% median increase across ecoregions) with more substantial increases in very large fires (321% median increase) relative to non-extreme fire years (Fig. 3a, b). Likewise, carbon emissions from forest and deforestation sources were many times higher (405% median increase) than in non-extreme fire years (Fig. 3c).\nClimate change has increased the odds of extreme regional forest fire years across the globe\nClimate model results show that climate change has increased the probability of 1-in-15-year FWI extremes that have been conducive to extreme regional fire years (Fig. 4). Many regions show risk ratios (RR) exceeding two under a contemporary (2011\u20132040) climate relative to that of a quasi-preindustrial (1851\u20131900) climate. The RR is calculated as the ratio of the probability of FWI extremes exceeding the benchmark 1-in-15-year value under the contemporary climate to the counterfactual (here quasi-preindustrial) climate. We additionally find broad model agreement of large increases in the Western US, Mediterranean, and Amazon regions, where nearly all models show RR \u2265 2 for FWIfs and FWI95d. Only Canada and Siberia regions had a few models with no change or a reduction in probability of FWI extremes, corresponding with increased summer precipitation (Fig. S7). Lastly, no systematic differences in RR across climate models were seen as a function of climate sensitivity or the increase in global mean temperature through 2040 (Fig. S7).\nMore generally across global forest ecoregions, the median RR of extreme FWI metrics was 1.88\u20132.52 across metrics (multi-model median across the three FWI metrics), suggesting much higher likelihoods of such extremes under a contemporary climate than under quasi preindustrial climate (Fig. 5; Table S1; Tables S2\u2013S4 for individual models). The largest RR was seen in Amazonian ecoregions, where the likelihood of FWI extremes increased by over fourfold. A majority of tropical and temperate ecoregions showed strong intermodel agreement of increased RR (Fig. S8). Risk ratios were more uncertain across models in magnitude, and in some cases in the direction of change, in the boreal forests of northwestern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia. Overall, we show a doubling in the likelihood of 1-in-15-year FWI metrics (RR \u2265 2) for 46\u201365% (multi-model median change) of forested areas globally under contemporary climate compared to quasi-preindustrial climate, and a decrease in the likelihoods of extremes (RR \u2264 1) for 3\u20138% of forested area (Table S1). Results for individual models show widespread agreement of increased RR (Tables S2\u2013S4). The more muted change in RR shown here compared to case study regions is likely a product of the smaller spatial scales of ecoregions that weaken signal-to-noise ratios35. The same factors somewhat limit a fair comparison of RR across ecoregions due to the variety in their spatial scales.\nThe largest increase in RR was seen for FWIfs and FWI95d, with the lowest change for FWImax (Table S1). The more limited increase in FWImax is consistent with the weaker emergence of this metric with future climate change36. Many of the most extreme fire weather days realized through FWImax are associated with wind extremes concurrent with dry fuels, the former of which exhibits more uncertainty to anthropogenic climate forcing37. By contrast, widespread increases in temperature and declines in surface relative humidity facilitate drier fuels (as realized through build-up indices) that drive robust increases in FWIfs and FWI95d13.\nDiscussion\nPrior research has shown strong intra-to-interannual climate-fire relationships at regional scales2,15,16 and the role of weather in driving extreme fire events30. This study adds to this body of work by demonstrating that extreme regional fire years across forested areas of the globe typically coincide with statistically rare fire weather conditions (e.g., chronically high FWI, days exceeding the 95th percentile FWI), quantified with a 1-in-15-year recurrence interval. While previous studies have alluded to such relationships on limited geographic scales in the modern and historical record4,38,39,40, our findings show these results to hold for most forested lands globally outside of regions dominated by deforestation and forest degradation. Similar to other climate extremes, the FWI extremes examined here are a product of multiple interacting drivers on the weather-climate continuum. These drivers include prolonged periods of simultaneous warmth and aridity41, accentuated by persistent meteorological patterns42, and capstone weather events at the apex of fuel drying, such as dry frontal passages, pyrocumulonimbus events, and downslope winds43.\nExtreme regional fire years in temperate and boreal forests, which tended to occur in the latter portion of the record, often occurred in years with extreme FWI metrics. Extreme fire years in temperate forests of the Mediterranean Basin, Chile, the western US, and Australia have been additionally exacerbated by excess fuel abundance and fuel continuity stemming from fire suppression, abandonment of rural agriculture, forestry practices that favor high-density monocultures, and the introduction of flammable non-native species44\u2014all of which favor fires that resist fire suppression coincident with extreme fire weather. Moreover, concurrent widespread fire weather extremes increase potential for favorable fire growth across broad regions that can feed back to limit the efficacy of fire suppression efforts17.\nConversely, we found a different response for regions that were dominated by forest degradation (Amazon, Southeast Asia) and widespread anthropogenic fire use, including prescribed burning (e.g., southeastern US). Extreme fire years in tropical biomes qualitatively occurred in places subject to deforestation\u2013agricultural burning that coincided with moderate-to-severe drought conditions. The tendency for most of the most extreme fire years seen in tropical ecoregions in the first decade of the study period (Fig. 1b) may be a product of waning deforestation rates45. Conversely, 2024\u2014which was outside of our study period\u2014had the highest burned area on the MODIS record for parts of the Amazon, coinciding with extreme drought and record chronic FWI46. Notably, we show here that Amazon was one of the global hotspots of escalating odds of FWI extremes with continued climate change.\nThe lack of unifying relationships between extreme fire years in forested areas and antecedent moisture in the prior one to two years is consistent with these regions being primarily flammability-limited and less dependent on factors influencing antecedent vegetation productivity2,47. Longer-term drought was not as closely linked to extreme fire years as within fire season FWI metrics, similar to findings in the western US48. Likewise, our focus on surface fire weather metrics does not account for the potential for other atmospheric drivers, such as instability that contribute to plume-dominated fires or widespread lightning events in ignition-limited fire regimes49 facilitating extreme fire years. Lastly, while these results hold for forested ecoregions globally, there are distinctly different biophysical constraints in fuel-limited grassland and shrubland-dominated regions, suggesting that our findings between extreme FWI and extreme fire years are not transferable to non-forested landscapes.\nWe demonstrate that human-caused climate change has significantly increased the likelihood of extreme regional fire years in global forested areas. Prior work has shown that anthropogenic climate change has and is projected to increase fire weather for parts of the globe36,50,51, and a few studies have focused on changing probabilities of extreme fire years, albeit at limited geographical scales52. Here we find that the likelihood of 1-in-15-year FWI extremes\u2014comparable to the magnitudes coincident with the most extreme regional fire years this century\u2014are 88-152% greater across forested ecoregions under contemporary climate (2011\u20132040) than under a quasi preindustrial climate (1851\u20131900) with robust results across the climate models used herein. Our findings largely align with limited regional attribution studies in terms of the direction of change27,28,53, although they differ in magnitude due to varied choices of indicators, attribution approaches, spatial scales, models, and specific thresholds used (e.g., event-attribution studies often use thresholds based on events versus the generic thresholds used herein). Models with multiple ensemble members were used to aid in robustness. However, we are limited by only using output from nine climate models that had the necessary meteorological variables for calculating FWI and furthermore are unable to resolve finer-scale changes that might be pertinent to extreme fire weather or land-surface feedbacks, given the use of non-downscaled climate model output.\nOur results are particularly important in the context of fire management\u2014historically, response-driven fire management has focused on suppressing individual wildfires as they arise with the assumption that sufficient emergency response resources will be available to deal with both existing and new fires. Region-wide extreme fire years, however, have demonstrated the fallacy of this strategy, as suppression resources are overwhelmed by the high number of large wildfires burning simultaneously, and demand exceeds supply. While climate mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions remain crucial2,12, adaptation strategies will be vital in improving readiness and resilience in at-risk regions. These on-the-ground efforts take several forms: proactive fuel reduction at local scales to reduce fire intensity and weaken climate-fire sensitivity, fire prevention efforts to minimize human-caused ignitions, and adaptation measures to minimize direct and indirect impacts of fires on communities and ecosystems54. With increasingly extended fire seasons, resource limitations will necessitate a shift in fire management tactics to be less reactive and suppression-oriented and become more proactive in restoring beneficial fire and preparing landscapes and communities to withstand fire and mitigate disastrous outcomes.\nMethods\nFire and climate datasets\nMonthly burned area was sourced from MODIS MCD64A155 at 500 m horizontal resolution for March 2002\u2013February 2024. To distinguish between tree and non-tree cover burned area, we employed the annual MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (MOD44B56) and defined forested burned areas where pre-fire tree cover exceeded 20%16. Annual forested burned area was calculated using fire years defined as March-February57, which better captures the Southern Hemisphere fire season than calendar years and reflects the nadir in global fire activity in February-March. Note that the MODIS burned area product does not discern between wildland fire from other sources of biomass burning (e.g., agricultural burning, deforestation), and hence we intentionally do not refer to this as wildfire or wildfire burned area.\nAdditional fire datasets used included fire carbon emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4s58). GFED fire carbon emissions data were restricted to contributions from boreal and temperate forest fires and deforestation/degradation fires, and limited to the period 2002\u20132023; no data were available for the first 2 months of 2024. We additionally used attributes from individual fire events from the global fire atlas59,60, based on MODIS MCD64A1, which was extended through February 2024. These data provide the number of fire events and fire sizes during March 2002\u2013February 2024.\nMeteorological data were acquired from ERA-561 at a 0.25\u00b0 resolution from 1979\u20132024. To allow for direct compatibility with FWI calculated from climate model output, we calculated FWI using daily maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, daily precipitation total, and daily mean wind speed as in prior studies28,36 and used the overwintering procedure that adjusts for initial values as the start of the fire season. We considered both antecedent moisture in the prior one to two years, using actual evapotranspiration and precipitation, as well as concurrent fire danger realized through the FWI. We focus our analysis on the FWI from the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System62 given its widespread use and correlative relationships with regional interannual burned area globally16 and extreme fire events30. FWI incorporates the influence of fuel drying across a stratum of three fuel classes along with potential spread rate, and is calculated as a function of temperature, relative humidity, precipitation accumulation, and wind speed.\nClimate model output from nine models participating in CMIP6 was used in our climate attribution exercise. These data were acquired from Quilcaille et al., who calculated the FWI metrics used herein. We constrained our analysis to the historical (1851\u20132014) and SSP2-45 scenario (2015\u20132040) for models that calculated FWI using daily minimum relative humidity and had at least three ensemble members (Table S5). The latter criterion was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in calculations of risk ratio and is particularly useful for attribution of rare extremes. FWI output from climate models was not bias-corrected. While the direct use of climate model output inhibits direct comparison of numerical values of metrics like FWI with observations, this approach best preserves the climate change signal used herein63.\nIdentifying extreme regional fire years\nThere is a myriad of approaches for codifying extreme fires31. Arguably, the use of burned area in defining extreme fire years is among the more accessible and reproducible, given the availability of global burned area data from satellite records along with country-specific fire data for some geographies that dates back further. Herein, we define extreme regional fire years as those with the greatest amount of forested area burned over a given geographic area during the 2002\u20132023 observational period. However, we acknowledge that this working definition of extreme fire years is not a panacea for fire impacts, as burned area does not scale to societal fire impacts33.\nOur focus on extreme regional fire years presumes the dominance of top-down climate drivers and enablers of fire activity. We considered multiple scales of analysis. National boundaries are commonly used because fire records, impact reporting, and management strategies are typically organized at the country level. However, our study also examines larger scales\u2014such as regions spanning multiple countries\u2014and ecoregion-based scales that reflect shared macroscale vegetation regimes.\nWe first identified a small but representative sample of eight recent extreme fire years across the four major forest biomes of the world affected by fires: boreal, temperate conifer, temperate broadleaf, and tropical32. Within each forest biome, we selected the two extreme fire years (i.e., highest area burned in the MODIS period during 2002\u20132023) from different parts of the world that have been identified in recent literature. Through this process, we identified eight total case study events: (1) 2006 Southeast Asia, (2) 2010 Amazon Basin, (3) 2012 Siberia, (4) 2017 Mediterranean Basin/Iberian Peninsula, (5) 2019\u20132020 Southeast Australia, (6) 2020 western US, (7) 2023 Chile, and (8) 2023 Canada (Table 1; Fig. 1a). We complement these case studies by conducting analyses across forested ecoregions of the globe64. Following Abatzoglou et al., we excluded ecoregions where forested land accounted for <20% of the ecoregion.\nFor each region, we tabulated several statistics coincident with the peak fire year: (i) forested area burned from MCD64A1, (ii) fire C emissions from GFED4s, and (iii) both the total number of fires and very large fires from the global fire atlas59,60. For the case study regions, we use a threshold of 100 km2 to delineate very large fires. However, as not all ecoregions experience fires exceeding 100 km2, we define very large fires at the ecoregion level as the top 1% of fires by size for each ecoregion. We contextualize these statistics relative to the average annual values for all remaining years. For case study regions, we cataloged contributing climatic and non-climatic factors and fire impact data (e.g., fatalities, evacuation, structure loss, cost), where available, from the literature.\nClimatic context of regional extreme fire seasons\nFollowing Abatzoglou et al., we calculated three annual FWI metrics that track different attributes of fire weather and their relationship to potential fire activity: (i) days per year exceeding the local historical (1979\u20132023) 95th percentile FWI (FWI95d), (ii) annual maximum FWI (FWImax), and (iii) annual maximum 90-day mean FWI (FWIfs) given that a majority of regional annual burned area occurs in a continuous 2\u20135 month window during the year16. To complement our leading hypotheses that extreme fire years are enabled by extreme fire weather, we considered annual actual evapotranspiration and precipitation in the previous fire year (March\u2013February) from ERA-5. In fuel-limited fire regimes, increased primary productivity during anomalously wet conditions in the prior growing season is linked with enhanced fire activity2. While antecedent moisture\u2013burned area links are weak across forested ecoregions globally16,47, historical large fire years in dry forests of the southwestern US often occurred 1\u20132 year after wet conditions65.\nTo understand common climate factors associated with extreme regional fire years, we ranked the climate metrics, including concurrent FWI metrics and antecedent moisture, relative to the modern observational period of ERA-5 (1979\u20132023). A longer 45-year time series was examined here rather than strictly the contemporaneous 2002\u20132023 period to provide more robust estimates of extremes. We additionally estimated return period intervals coincident with extreme regional fire years for each metric. Return periods were estimated using a GEV approach using data from a 1979\u20132023 baseline. While studies often use non-stationarity extreme value analyses in a changing climate66, typically using global mean temperature as a covariate, we opt not to add that layer of complexity in our core analysis. Instead, we use a GEV approach over specific time periods to assess the changing probabilities of extremes as done in some attribution studies67,68, and to aid in the interpretability of our results.\nQuantify the role of human-caused climate change in contemporary extreme fire seasons\nNext, we quantified how anthropogenic climate change has altered the likelihood of climate-enabled extreme fire years. This was done using a probabilistic approach common to climate attribution questions and guided by analytical results from our observational analyses. Specifically, we used the return intervals of FWI metrics informed by the GEV analysis of observed extreme fire years and applied this approach across all metrics and regions of analysis using common baseline years (1979\u20132023) as in observations.\nWe calculated the magnitude of the 15-year return period for FWI metrics by pooling data across all ensemble members per GCM for the baseline period (1979\u20132023) to match that of the observational results. We then calculated the likelihood of exceedance from this 15-year return period for FWI metrics for both a quasi-preindustrial period (1851\u20131900) and a contemporary period (here, 2011\u20132040). Note that we use a period centered around the present day rather than the recent past (e.g., 1991\u20132020), as our goal is to quantify the present-day likelihood of climate extremes that have been linked with recent extreme regional fire years. These estimates were then used to calculate risk ratios (RR) of FWI extremes for the contemporary period relative to the quasi-preindustrial period. These risk ratios provide a numerical measure of how the risk of extremes has changed due to anthropogenic climate change and are calculated as the ratio of the probability of FWI extremes exceeding the 1-in-15-year value (defined based on model years 1979\u20132023 to match observational analytics) under the contemporary climate to the quasi-preindustrial climate. Calculations were done separately for each GCM by pooling all model years across ensembles for the contemporary period (2011\u20132040) together and likewise all model years across ensembles for the counterfactual quasi preindustrial (1851\u20131900) period. We additionally used a bootstrap resampling (n = 1000) approach to quantify cases where the 95% confidence interval of RR exceeds 1. We present results for the 9-model median, except where otherwise specified. We note that our attribution relies on data-driven estimates of internal climate variability using early-industrial historical forcings with nominal anthropogenic contributions, rather than historical natural forcings\u2014such as volcanic eruptions\u2014that explicitly exclude human influence on the climate system.\nData availability\nHistorical meteorological data used herein from ERA-5 are available from (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/), and climate projections used in the paper are available at https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/583391.

      "text": "The catastrophic Palisades and Eaton fires (Fig. 1a; beginning on 7 January 2025) had an impact on Los Angeles (LA) that surpassed the devastation of the tragic 2003 Southern California fires (Fig. 1b) and have been met with a great deal of blame and accusations. Were the fires due to ineffective fire suppression, deficient fuel management, lack of an adequate urban water system for extinguishing structure fires or climate change? The answer is that it is complicated. Current suppression resources cannot sufficiently control wind-driven urban fires; more fire suppression resources without fire-proofing the wildland\u2013urban interface probably would not be effective. In recent LA fires, winds were so strong that wildland and urban vegetation treatments may not have been sufficient to forestall an urban conflagration. It would be impossible to build a sufficiently high capacity water system to fight hundreds of simultaneous structure fires with current infrastructure budgets, let alone physical limitations. Finally, climate change has made the conditions conducive to extreme fire behaviour worse1; but without an ignition source, these fires would not have occurred despite all other conditions being ripe.\nMany of the destructive fires in California are started by electricity-related ignitions, mainly during extreme winds2. To prevent such fires, utilities have implemented public safety power shut-offs (PSPS) as a fire prevention strategy during critical fire weather conditions; a practice that dates back to 2013 in Southern California. While the official causes of the LA fires are not yet determined, the Eaton fire started close to a powerline during one of the strongest Santa Ana wind events coincident with dry fuels in a decade. PSPS was implemented on some circuits on 7 January 2025, but preliminary information shows that the circuit co-located with the ignition was not de-energized.\nEarly investigations for the Palisades Fire suggest a possible source was the rekindling of a fire that was started by the New Year\u2019s fireworks and believed to have been fully suppressed. This would not be the first time rekindling of ignitions occurred. The Calf Canyon Fire in New Mexico in April 2022, which merged with the Hermit\u2019s Peak Fire to destroy more than 1,500 structures, was a holdover from a January pile burn that was not fully extinguished. There are other examples. \u2018Zombie\u2019 fires3 in permafrost burn under a pile of snow over the winter and carry smolders from one year to the next. Wildfires generally reduce hazardous fuels and mitigate the occurrence and intensity of subsequent fires in the same vicinity, but when a wildfire is not fully extinguished, the hazard reduction effect may be illusory if critical fire weather re-emerges.\nThe 2023 Lahaina Fire in Hawaii \u2014 one of the deadliest wildfires on record in the United States with more than 100 casualties \u2014 started just outside of the town, and so did the Eaton and Palisades Fires. When fires ignite within high-density developments, they are generally detected and suppressed immediately, leaving less room for growth. When fires start where they can get traction and reach wildland\u2013urban interface structures within hours, a disaster emerges \u2014 especially during high winds. Abundant flammable materials in structural fires develop large flame lengths and may generate a flood of embers. Winds transport embers miles ahead of the fire line, creating spotting fires, reinforcing the fire growth and compounding fire suppression, evacuation and emergency response challenges. Strong winds also restrict aerial response resource deployment, leaving on-the-ground crews with limited capacity to suppress the fire.\nHuman-started fires account for 84% of all fires across the United States4, and they show an increasing trend across the country5. The number of human-started fires, however, has been decreasing in Southern California (Fig. 1c) owing to fire prevention measures directed at both intentional and unintentional ignition sources. Human-started fires particularly during extreme fire weather can be further limited through various fire prevention measures \u2014 including PSPS, alert systems, public education, closure of recreational areas, law enforcement presence and fuel reduction around communities6, depending on the ignition source (Fig. 1d\u2013f) \u2014 but with nearly 25 million people living in highly flammable landscapes of Southern California, there is a limit to what can be accomplished.\nSuccessful initial attacks to suppress wildfires burning proximate to populated areas, when they are still small, are also critical for saving life and property. Advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and other technology may further enhance the success rate of initial attack. Predicting when and where fire ignitions might occur to pre-emptively deploy resources can also enhance the efficacy of fire suppression. Nevertheless, multiple starts of new fires and synchronous critical fire danger across large swaths of the western United States spread the limited response resources thin.\nReferences\nKhorshidi, M.

  "argos_summary": "The article explains that climate change has significantly increased the odds of extreme regional forest fire years worldwide, citing evidence from the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles and other global events. It highlights the complex interplay of factors\u2014ineffective suppression, deficient fuel management, limited urban water systems, and human ignition sources\u2014while emphasizing that climate change alone does not cause fires without ignition. Human-started fires dominate U.S. fire statistics, but prevention measures like PSPS and public education can reduce them, especially during extreme fire weather. The piece also notes Boise State University\u2019s research focus and briefly touches on Africa\u2019s large fire acreage, political commentary on Congress, media, and international relations, and the use of video games to illustrate global concepts.",
