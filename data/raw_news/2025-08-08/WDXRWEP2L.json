  "description": "This desktop comes with amazing performance, and a bunch of freebies, but not for long.",
  "content": "Laptops have come a long way in recent years, but sometimes a classic desktop setup is still the better choice. If you\u2019re after better performance, more ports, and upgradability, a desktop is the way to go. HP makes some of the best options out there, and right now, you can snag one at a fraction of its retail price.\n\nThe HP All-in-One 21.5-inch desktop is going for just $590 on Amazon after a massive 67% discount. That\u2019s more than $1,200 off its regular price, and the package even includes a wired keyboard, a mouse, and more freebies \u2013 back-to-school shopping doesn\u2019t get any better. But given how steep this discount is, it\u2019s safe to say the stock won\u2019t last long.\n\nThis sleek, no-fuss PC gets you a smooth 21.5-inch Full HD display for beautifully detailed visuals that make everything from spreadsheets to movies pop. It\u2019s anti-glare and flicker-free, so working in bright spaces or for long periods won\u2019t strain your eyes. You can even adjust the display height to find the most comfortable viewing angle.\n\nPowering the machine is an Intel Celeron J4025 processor that handles tasks like studying, browsing, and light streaming with ease. We don\u2019t expect it to shine during resource-heavy gaming or editing, but for school and office work, it\u2019s more than up to the job. Add in the 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and you\u2019re all set for some day-to-day multitasking. Working on presentations with multiple tabs open or hopping on video calls \u2013 the PC will be the last thing slowing you down.\n\nInvesting in a webcam separately won\u2019t be necessary either. The built-in HP True Vision HD webcam delivers great picture quality, while the AI noise reduction makes sure you are heard just as well.\n\nConnectivity options are solid. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 get you strong, reliable connections even in crowded settings. For where cords are needed, you\u2019ll be all set with USB-A, USB-C, HDMI-out, and Ethernet ports. Those who still have some disks lying around will appreciate the included external CD/DVD drive.\n\nOther freebies include preinstalled Windows 11 Pro, dust plugs to keep your ports clean, a camera protector for privacy, a cleaning cloth, a wired keyboard, and a mouse. That\u2019s nearly $400 of accessories and software you won\u2019t have to buy separately. If you\u2019ve been meaning to upgrade your home or office setup, this HP All-in-One at $590 with all the extras is a rare deal. Grab it while it\u2019s still available.",
