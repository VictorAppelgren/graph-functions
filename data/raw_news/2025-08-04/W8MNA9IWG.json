  "title": "National Night Out To Connect Police With Community In Central Bucks Co.",
  "description": "The event is designed to enhance the relationship between neighbors and law enforcement while spotlighting the community.",
  "content": "National Night Out is an annual, nationwide campaign that promotes strong police-community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to step out of your home, meet your neighbors, and spend time with the very law enforcement officers and first responders who serve your community,\u201d said Bucks County Sheriff Fred Harran. \u201cAcross Bucks County, our local police departments will be hosting block parties, cookouts, safety demonstrations, and family-friendly activities. It is, in its simplest form, a night out against crime.\n\n\u201cBut its importance runs much deeper than a single evening of fun,\u201d says Harran. \u201cIn my nearly 40 years of service in law enforcement, I have seen time and again that the bedrock of a safe community is not just the presence of police, but the presence of trust. When neighbors know one another, they look out for one another. When residents have a personal connection with their local officers \u2014 when they see them not just as a uniform and a patrol car, but as fellow community members \u2014 it breaks down barriers and fosters the open communication that is essential to preventing and solving crime. \u201cNational Night Out is where that vital work happens organically,\u201d said Harran. \u201cIt\u2019s where a child gets to sit in a fire truck, a teenager can ask a police officer about their job, and a homeowner can get tips on neighborhood watch programs. It is an investment in the single most powerful public safety tool we have: our partnership. This event sends a clear message to those who would seek to do harm that our neighborhoods are organized, vigilant, and united with their law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the National Night Out events taking place this week in Central Bucks County. They are free, family-friendly and open to the public.\n\u2022 In Buckingham, the police department will hold its third annual National Night Out event hosted by Peddler's Village and LBK Build on Wednesday, August 6 from 5 to 8 p.m. at Peddler\u2019s Village. The public its invited to join the police in building stronger relationships between law enforcement and their neighbors. The evening offers an opportunity to meet local officers and their K-9 companions, enjoy music, local vendors, and food trucks. The rain date is Thursday, August 7.\n\u2022 Doylestown Township will host National Night Out on Tuesday, August 5 from 4 to 8 p.m. at Central Park, 425 Wells Road, Doylestown. As in Years past, the public will have an opportunity to meet and greet emergency responders from the greater Doylestown area, including Central Bucks Regional, Warrington, Plumstead, and New Britain Township. There will be music, food, ice cream, and live demonstrations.\n\u2022 The New Hope Borough and the Solebury Township Police Departments will be joining together for a night of free fun on Tuesday, August 5 from 6 to 8:30 p.m. at Laurel Park (behind the police station) at 3092 North Sugan Road. The evening offers an opportunity to visit with local police officers and firefighters and to view vehicles and equipment. There will be free food, games, and lots more.\n\u2022 The Perkasie Borough Police Department invites the public to attend National Night Out on Tuesday, August 5 from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Perkasie Town Center (N. 7th St. and W. Market St). The rain location is the Perkasie Borough Firehouse (5th and Arch). This year\u2019s event will be expanded to include additional police departments and vendors.",
