      "feedback": "Solid breadth and source density, but the piece needs a rigorous, testable 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, timing, and invalidations, plus tighter causal links and quantified implications. Actionable edit plan: (1) Rebuild as a clean base-case plus 2 explicit alternates (bullish and bearish on policy/AI and nontraditional flows) with 0–6 week, 2–4 month, and 4–6 month windows and a concise end-state/output section (base, alt1, alt2, risks, watch-list signals, confidence). (2) Anchor the macro/storyline in first-principles causal chains: fiscal package → debt path → rate/credit conditions → equity/credit valuations; cite precise numbers (Tax-cut magnitude ≈ $4.4 trillion over 10 years per EPJYXB7DX; debt impact ≈ $4 trillion over 10 years per FOM34PUWA), and link Medicaid/work‑requirement mechanics to state budgets (80 hours/month; 19–64 adult eligibility rules) with exact language from FOM34PUWA. (3) Map corporate/market transmission channels with clear catalysts and invalidate scenarios: AI productivity upside (Range), co‑ownership/alternative investments (Pacaso, mogul) and their growth metrics (21% YoY real estate volume; 18.8%–18–% IRR range cited in UPV3X2MQ6 sources), healthcare AI uptake (HeartSciences—Mayo Clinic adopter; Medicare reimbursement starting 2025; FDA Breakthrough designation in ILYC1M41F), and UAS industry data (1,400 UAS jobs in 2025; $105k average in FOM34PUWA). (4) Quantify where possible and avoid generalities: use the 1.8T vacation-home market scope for Pacaso; 1.3T global vacation market; 40% Americans want a vacation home (UPV3X2MQ6); 80-hour Medicaid work rule; 50k–60k mile warranties in tire piece only as consumer signals, not market forecasts. (5) Reconcile conflicts and be explicit about polarity: for Big Beautiful Bill, present both the GOP growth/deficit narrative (EPJYXB7DX) and DNC/CRFB-style projected health-insurance tradeoffs (Whatley/What is in source 4 vs Fox Business/OBBBA effects in 8); explicitly tag each assertion with its ID (EPJYXB7DX, FOM34PUWA, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, V8TEZOR8R, FOM34PUWA, FOM34PUWA again); note where sources agree or diverge. (6) Sharpen the writing to ensure the causal chain is explicit and single‑pass readable: “policy action → macro impulse → sector/flow shifts → asset prices/credit terms,” and end each path with a clear invalidation cue (e.g., policy reversal, AI productivity surprise or disappointment, Medicaid rule rollout delays). (7) Tighten formatting so the ending lines deliver: Base case; 1–2 alts; explicit risks; watch-list signals; and a quantified confidence gauge. (8) Clean up mis‑references and ensure each claim ties to an ID (e.g., HeartSciences=ILY C1M41F; Pacaso/mogul/Range=UPV3X2MQ6; Grand Forks UAS=FOM34PUWA; tires=V8TEZOR8R; RNC/Tax bill=EPJYXB7DX; debt/regs=FOM34PUWA). This will yield a world-class, hedge‑fund‑style 3–6 month narrative with testable catalysts, timing, and risk controls.",
