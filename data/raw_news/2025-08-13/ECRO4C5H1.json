  "title": "Get Back to School Ready With This $599 Apple 13-Inch M1 MacBook Air",
  "description": "This laptop is great for students, writers and just about everyone else -- especially at this low, low price.",
  "content": "You may be eyeing Apple's latest M4 MacBook Air, but, in reality, most people probably don't need quite so much performance. Instead, consider picking up the M1 MacBook Air, a model that ushered in the new era of Apple M-series chips in 2020. It has a gorgeous 13-inch display, a fast chip and a great keyboard.\n\nThe best part? You can now get the device for just $599 at Walmart. This deal is available to everyone who wants to take advantage of it, but we suggest ordering soon -- we don't know how long this $50 discount will last. The good news? You can choose from three different colors when ordering.\n\nThe M1 MacBook Air has an Apple M1 chip, which includes an eight-core CPU and a seven-core GPU. That chip is backed up by 8GB of RAM and a fast 256GB solid-state drive. And the 13.3-inch display promises sharp text and vibrant colors, with a resolution of 2,560x1,600 pixels.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nThis MacBook Air is silent because it lacks a fan and sports a long-lasting battery that can run for up to 18 hours between charges. Factor in support for Apple's latest macOS software updates and tight integration with other Apple hardware, like the iPhone and iPad, and this extremely capable laptop is hard to beat at this price. It also makes a great option for teens or college students who want to be in the Apple ecosystem but don't want to spend the big bucks on the M4 models.\n\nDon't worry if this deal isn't for you, though. Feel free to peruse our other top laptop deals and check back often since we'll be updating these pages throughout this sale event.\n\nThe M1 MacBook Air is the best MacBook you can get on a budget. It marked the beginning of a new era for Apple, delivering significant performance and efficiency gains over its Intel-powered MacBooks.\n\nAlthough we've seen newer chips from Apple, the M1 is still powerful. It also has a thin, light and fanless design and offers solid battery life. At under $600, it's difficult to find a laptop that will tick as many of the right boxes as this one.",

      "text": "The MacBook Air has finally caught up to the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro. Apple on Wednesday announced its 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air models have been upgraded to its M4 processor. The iPad Pro was the first Apple device to receive the M4 treatment last May, and the MacBook Pro followed suit near the end of last year. Now, you can get Apple's latest silicon in its most affordable laptop -- and it's even more affordable than the previous M3 Air.\nThe $999 Air is back\nIn addition to the processor upgrade, the other big news is the return of the MacBook Air's $999 starting price. The last MacBook Air to be released with a price in the triple digits was the M1 Air back in 2020. The M2 Air started at $1,199, and the M3 Air started at $1,099, so we've been trending toward the M4's $999 price, but it's nice to finally return. With Apple's educational discount, students can get the M4 Air for $899.\nThe M4 MacBook Air starts at \u00a3999 in the UK and AU$1,699 in Australia.\nThe 15-inch M4 MacBook Air is also $100 cheaper than the previous M3 version. It starts at $1,199 -- or $1,099 with educational pricing.\nM4 processor and sky blue color\nThe $999 MacBook Air features an M4 processor with 10 CPU cores and eight GPU cores, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive. The minimum memory of 16GB isn't new -- Apple upped it from the meager 8GB of RAM to coincide with the release of the M4 MacBook Pro last fall -- but is still appreciated, especially with the new lower starting price. But the 256GB SSD? Sigh. I guess we'll need to wait at least another year until Apple delivers a 512GB SSD with the base configuration of the MacBook Air. A 256GB drive fills up fast, Apple!\nThe step-up $1,199 model includes a 512GB SSD while also delivering a couple more GPU cores with its M4 chip. The $1,399 configuration bumps you up to 24GB of RAM.\nM4 MacBook Air lineup\n| Starting price | $999 | $1,199 | $1,399 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| CPU | M4 | M4 | M4 |\n| No. of CPU cores | 10 | 10 | 10 |\n| No. of GPU cores | 8 | 10 | 10 |\n| RAM | 16GB | 16GB | 24GB |\n| Storage | 256GB | 512GB | 512GB |\nThe M4 MacBook Air also includes a webcam upgrade. The M4 models get the 12-megapixel Center Stage camera found on the MacBook Pro and iMac.\nApple didn't introduce any design changes with the M4 MacBook Air, but it did roll out a new color option -- sky blue. This metallic light blue takes the place of space gray. The other three colors -- midnight, silver and starlight -- for the Air remain.\nPreorders are open now for the M4 MacBook Air, and the new models will start shipping in a week."

      "text": "We've been reviewing MacBooks since the very first polycarbonate MacBook appeared in 2006 -- and we covered Apple's PowerBooks and iBooks before that. Apple's current laptop lineup is split between the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, and the differences between the two lines are significant. The current MacBook Pros are great for those who need higher-level processing and graphics performance for content creation, graphic design, advanced STEM work and gaming. The Air is more of an everyday laptop that favors portability over performance, though it has power to spare and a long battery life, according to our tests. That\u2019s why the MacBook Air is CNET\u2019s pick for the best MacBook for most people.\nOur Picks\nLAPTOP DEALS OF THE WEEK\nWhat is the best overall MacBook?\nWith the release of the M4 MacBook Air a few months ago, both the MacBook Pro and Air lines now feature Apple's latest silicon. The 15-inch MacBook Air acts as the bridge between the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro line, providing a bigger display without the MacBook Pro premium. With Apple dropping the price by $100 for the M4 MacBook Air models, the price gap between MacBook Air and MacBook Pro is even bigger than it was before.\nStarting at $1,199 at Apple (and regularly discounted at $1,099 at Amazon), the 15-inch Air sits in the sweet spot, making it the best MacBook for most people. As I sit here in July, the larger MacBook Air is my favorite MacBook for its roomy display, trim design and reasonable price. The smaller and cheaper 13-inch Air remains a great pick for students and others with busy lives and slim wallets. The older MacBook M1 is still available as a Walmart exclusive for just $599 for budget shoppers, and the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 provides the added power for graphics pros but at a great expense.\nFor more, please read my MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro comparison and you can also check out the new look and features of the next version of Apple's Mac operating system, MacOS Tahoe.\nRead more: Best VPN for Mac\nBest MacBooks of 2025\nPros\n- Optimal balance of screen size and system weight\n- M4 processor provides good balance of performance and battery life\n- Lower $1,199 starting price\nCons\n- 256GB SSD is too small for the price\n- $200 upcharge for more RAM or storage is steep\n- Smooth ProMotion display still exclusive to MacBook Pro\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air is proof that you don't need a Pro to get a larger display. It supplies a larger screen that you once found only on the pricier Pro models. If you're eyeing the 14- or 16-inch Pro models primarily for the added screen size, the MacBook Air 15 is the more affordable option you should go for, especially at its new lower starting price.\nWhy we like it\nThe roomy, 15.3-inch display is powered by Apple's M4 chip and 16GB of RAM. The M4 update adds incremental improvements (and a new sky blue color) to an already fantastic laptop that sits in the Goldilocks Zone of Apple's MacBook lineup.\nWho it's best for\nWith its roomy display, trim design and new lower starting price, the 15-inch M4 MacBook Air should be viewed as the default Air, with its cheaper and smaller 13-inch sibling a good alternative for students and others with tighter budgets and busy, on-the-go lifestyles.\nPros\n- Big performance gains from M1, Intel MacBook Airs\n- Great design, features\n- Support for two external displays simultaneously with MacBook display\n- 12-megapixel Center Stage camera\nCons\n- 256GB SSD might fill up fast\n- Expensive upgrades\nFor Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air, the bigger news than moving from Apple's M3 silicon to M4 chips is the drop in price.\nWhy we like it\nStarting at $999, the MacBook M4 Air is $100 cheaper than the entry point for the previous M3 models. In addition to a slight bump in performance over the previous generation, the M4 Air adds a Center Stage webcam, better support for external displays and a new ice blue color option.\nWho it's best for\nThe M4 refresh adds up to a good, if minor, update to an already fantastic laptop that\u2019s now more affordable for students and those on tight budgets. With its mix of strong overall performance, long battery life and a trim design, it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s such a popular laptop for campus life.\nPros\n- M1 Air easily outperforms old Intel versions\n- Great battery life\n- Fanless design runs cool and quiet\nCons\n- No external design or feature changes\n- No mobile broadband options, 5G or otherwise\nThis model has been surpassed, but not totally replaced, by the newer M2, M3 and M4 models. It's available at Walmart for $649, which is a hefty $350 less than its original price. It's also $350 less than the cheapest M4 Air.\nWhy we like it\nFor many years, this was everyone's favorite laptop. It was reasonably priced, thin, light and built like a tank. It could last for years and take lots of falls and bumps. You get only two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, but that's enough for most people, as long as you can get a compatible dongle.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great pick for budget shoppers looking for a speedy and stylish do-it-all laptop.\nPros\n- Fast\n- Excellent screen\n- Improved webcam\n- Same solid design as previous model\nCons\n- Heavy\n- Big drop in performance in low-power mode\n- Prone to fingerprint smudges\nApple's latest update to its 16-inch MacBook Pro delivers M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max processors, an improved webcam and an optional nano-texture nonreflective finish for the display.\nWhy we like it\nThe design remains unchanged from the previous version, but under the hood the new M4 Pro chip offers better overall performance and, sees big gains in multicore and rendering performance. Although the design didn't receive an update, it's still solid and offers a reasonable weight given the roomy display.\nWho it's best for\nGraphics pros and creators who need the power and big screen of the 16-inch MacBook Pro will be best served by this laptop. Like the previous series, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro processor starts at $2,499, and the M4 Max model starts at $3,499. If you need the speed, it's worth the dough.\nApple MacBooks compared\nSee how the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models measure up.\n| 13-inch MacBook Air (M4) | 15-inch MacBook Air (M4) | 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) | 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) | 16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Starting price | $999 | $1,199 | $1,599 | $1,999 | $2,499 |\n| CPU | M4 | M4 | M4 | M4 Pro | M4 Pro |\n| No. of CPU cores | 10 | 10 | 10 | 12 | 14 |\n| No. of GPU cores | 8 | 10 | 10 | 16 | 20 |\n| Starting RAM | 16GB | 16GB | 16GB | 24GB | 24GB |\n| Starting storage | 256GB | 256GB | 512GB | 512GB | 512GB |\n| Screen size | 13.6 inches | 15.3 inches | 14.2 inches | 14.2 inches | 16.2 inches |\n| Screen resolution | 2,560x1,664 pixels | 2,880x1,864 pixels | 3,024x1,964 pixels | 3,024x1,964 pixels | 3,456x2,234 pixels |\n| Weight | 2.7 pounds | 3.3 pounds | 3.4 pounds | 3.5 pounds | 4.7 pounds |\n| Dimensions (HWD) | 0.44 x 11.97 x 8.46 inches | 0.45 x 13.4 x 9.35 inches | 0.61 x 12.31 x 8.71 inches | 0.61 x 12.31 x 8.71 inches | 0.66 x 14.01 x 9.77 inches |\n| Connections | Thunderbolt 4 x2, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 4 x2, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 4 x3, HDMI, SDXC card, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 4 x3, HDMI, SDXC card, headphone, MagSafe 3 | Thunderbolt 5 x3, HDMI, SDXC card, headphone, MagSafe 3 |\n| Battery | 52.6-watt\u2011hour | 66.5-watt\u2011hour | 72.4-watt-hour | 72.4-watt-hour | 100-watt-hour |\nMost recent additions\nThe new M4 versions of the MacBook Airs are the newest additions to the list. The 15-inch Air acts as the bridge between the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 and MacBook Pro line and offers fans the best of both worlds: a larger display without the MacBook Pro premium. Since Apple has dropped the price by $100 for the M4 MacBook Air models, the price gap between the Air and Pro has grown.\nFactors to consider when buying a MacBook\nThe first fork in the road you'll come to when shopping for a MacBook is whether to follow the Air path or head down the Pro road. For people who are looking for an everyday home laptop or a work laptop for running basic office apps, a MacBook Air will suffice. An Air is also a better pick for students on tight budgets. For creative types who need the added processing and graphics muscle of Apple's new M4 Pro and Max chips, a MacBook Pro is worth the added cost. To help you find the right MacBook for your needs and budget, here are the main considerations to keep in mind.\nPrice\nThe entry price for a MacBook is $649. That gets you the M1 MacBook Air that was released in 2020, but that offer is exclusive to Walmart. If you are shopping at Apple, pricing starts at $999 for the13-inch MacBook Air M4 and $1,199 for the 15-inch MacBook Air M4. Stepping up to a MacBook Pro model starts at $1,599. Here are the starting prices of Apple's current MacBook lineup:\n- 13-inch M4 MacBook Air: $999\n- 15-inch M4 MacBook Air: $1,199\n- 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro: $1,599\n- 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro: $2,499\nSize and display\nIf you'll be taking your MacBook with you to class, work or even down to your local coffee shop most mornings, an Air is the better choice. The 13-inch MacBook Air models weigh less than 3 pounds, and the roomier 15-inch Air weighs only 3.3 pounds, which is still lighter than the 14-inch MacBook Pro.\nThe flip side to portability is screen size. The 16-inch MacBook Pro gives you ample room to work and multitask, while the 14-inch MacBook Pro tries to hit the sweet spot between roomy display and travel ease. Unless you need Pro-level performance, we feel the 15-inch Air does a better job of hitting that target.\n- 13.3-inch M1 MacBook Air: 13.3-inch display (2,560x1,600 pixels), 2.8 pounds\n- 13.6-inch M4 MacBook Air: 13.6-inch display (2,560x1,664 pixels), 2.7 pounds\n- 15.3-inch M4 MacBook Air: 15.3-inch display (2,880x1,864 pixels), 3.3 pounds\n- 14.2-inch M4 MacBook Pro: 14.2-inch display (3,024x1,964 pixels), 3.4 pounds\n- 16.2-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro: 16.2-inch display (3,456x2,234 pixels), 4.7 pounds\nProcessor\nThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. MacBooks have used Apple's own processors since the introduction of the M1 processor in 2020. The M1-based MacBooks were clear improvements over Apple's earlier Intel-based machines in terms of overall performance, efficiency and battery life. The M1 MacBooks were more powerful, boasted longer runtimes and operated more coolly and quietly.\nThe latest lineup of MacBook Airs feature Apple's latest M4 chip, and the MacBook Pro line offers a choice of M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max processors. The M4 MacBook Air models offer slightly better performance than the M3-based versions, but the jump in performance is not nearly the same as going from Intel CPUs to the M1.\nGraphics\nThe graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. Apple's M-series CPUs integrate the GPU. The more processing cores the GPU has, the better the graphics performance. Here's the breakdown:\n- M1: 7-core or 8-core GPU\n- M2: 8-core or 10-core GPU\n- M3: 8-core or 10-core GPU\n- M4: 8-core or 10-core GPU\n- M4 Pro: 20-core or 32-core GPU\n- M4 Max: 32-core or 40-core GPU\nMemory\nMemory (or RAM) is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. With the exception of the older M1 Air sold at Walmart, MacBook Air models now start at 16GB of RAM along with the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro. The minimum on the M4 Pro MacBook Pro models is 24GB, and the M4 Max MacBook Pros serve up 36GB or more.\nYou can't upgrade the memory on recent MacBooks post purchase, so you'll need to get all of the RAM you'll need up front. MacBooks are able to smoothly run MacOS and the preinstalled apps with the minimum RAM offered, but doubling the RAM will make your MacBook feel faster and likely lead to a longer life of the laptop.\nStorage\nMacBooks feature solid-state drives, or SSDs. MacBook Air models start with a 256GB SSD, and MacBook Pros offer a 512GB SSD at minimum. If you use cloud storage for your files, music collection and photo library, then you might be able to get away with a 256GB SSD without filling it up before too long. We were happy to see the 13-inch MacBook Pro with its paltry 256GB SSD go away -- Pro users need 512GB at the very least.\nHow we test laptops\nThe review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.\nOur benchmark tests consist of a core set we run on every compatible system, including several we can run on both MacOS and Windows PCs. There's also an extended set of tests for specific use cases, such as gaming or content creation, where systems may have more powerful GPUs or higher-resolution displays that need to be evaluated.\nFor the hands-on portion of the reiview, the reviewer uses the laptop for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features like the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well everything works given the cost, and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or trade-offs for the price.\nThe list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our How We Test Computers page.\nOther laptops we've tested\nHP OmniBook X Flip 16: While it has a handful of appealing features, this midrange 16-inch convertible ends up being a clumsy assemblage of disparate parts.\nLenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition: It offers a cheap path to an OLED ultraportable, but is a ThinkPad a ThinkPad without the little red nub in the middle of the keyboard?\nHP OmniBook X Flip 14: This two-in-one laptop offers style, value and configuration options abound, including a 3K OLED display for only an extra $100.\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13-inch): It\u2019s compact, solidly built and great for travel, but the 13.8-inch version is the better choice as your daily driver.\nDell 14 Plus: Skip the two-in-one and opt for the clamshell laptop I tested, when it goes on sale.\nAcer Swift Go 16 (2025): Built around a beautiful 16-inch OLED screen, the latest Swift Go 16 improves on its predecessors without significant price inflation.\nDell 16 Plus 2-in-1: This big-screen, mini-LED convertible laptop certainly has some positives but there are a few too many minuses to give this Plus a full-throated recommendation.\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition: It\u2019s a great business laptop but can get pricey fast with upgrades.\nAcer Swift 14 AI: This midrange Copilot Plus PC offers incredible battery life but is missing one key feature.\nHP EliteBook X G1a: X does not mark the spot for this biz laptop when the Ultra version costs roughly the same and supplies a far better display inside a slimmer, more compact design.\nHP EliteBook Ultra G1i: With its compact, elegant design and excellent OLED display, HP's flagship EliteBook is a fantastic machine -- but it's worth waiting for a sale before buying.\nLenovo Yoga Slim 9i 14 Gen 10: It's ultrastylish and ultracompact, but maybe don't hide the camera behind the display next time?"

      "text": "Pros\n- Big boost to battery life\n- Performance in benchmark tests shows the M1 Air easily outperforming Intel versions\n- Fanless design runs cool and quiet\nCons\n- No external design or feature changes\n- App compatibility is an issue for early adopters\n- No mobile broadband options, 5G or otherwise\nGoing hands-on with the new M1-powered Apple MacBook Air feels very different from using any previous MacBook Air, even the early-2020 Intel version I tested alongside it. But that mostly comes from the new MacOS Big Sur experience, more than the hardware changes inside. Big Sur is a huge change for the Mac, with new visual flair, new controls and new ways of interfacing with your Mac. Once you account for the big OS update, the day-to-day experience will be familiar to anyone who has used a recent MacBook Air. That, by itself, is a big point in favor of the theory that switching Macs, especially the MacBook Air, from Intel CPUs to the new Apple-designed M1 system-on-chip will be overall a smooth transition.\nFor such a popular laptop -- I often call the MacBook Air the most universally useful laptop you can buy -- continuity of experience is incredibly important. That's true for Air users, who are usually looking for a sleek, reasonably priced machine that just works, as well as for those who use MacBook Pro laptops, the iMac , the Mac Mini or the Mac Pro for professional design, editing, photography or music work. Right now, only part of the Mac line is switching to Apple silicon. The rest, I'd expect to come sometime in the next year.\nA familiar experience\nThere are a couple of things working in the M1's favor when it comes to continuity of experience. The first is that much of what we do on our computers, again especially for the typical MacBook Air buyer, is done online, through cloud-based and browser-based tools.\nEmail, social media, shopping, video streaming, even workplace collaboration through Slack or other online tools -- it's all cloud- or browser-based, and for the most part highly platform-agnostic. The differences between the Mac and Windows capabilities of most laptops have narrowed significantly with this shift, and it's rare -- although not unheard of -- that a casual or mainstream user runs into the old problem of not having the right OS for the tool they need.\nRead more: Testing the entire new Apple Mac M1 lineup\nIn situations like the above, the new M1 MacBook Air feels very much like an Intel MacBook Air, which is a big selling point to anyone concerned about the wholesale platform change.\nThe Rosetta factor\nAssisting in this is the Rosetta 2 emulation technology, which automatically installs itself the first time you attempt to install a non-native app (as in, an app not optimized for the M1 platform). So far, it's let me install things like Adobe apps, including Photoshop and Premiere Pro, Steam for gaming and Google's Chrome web browser.\nAdobe adds its own warning message, letting you know you're still installing and running the Intel versions of these programs while the M1-native versions are being worked on. A version of Lightroom is coming later in 2020, Photoshop and other apps are not coming until sometime in 2021. As Adobe apps and Macs really go hand in hand, it's a bit shocking to me that zero Adobe apps are ready in their native forms on Day 1 of the M1 era. I'd have suspected Apple would keep a team of Adobe engineers chained in the basement of 1 Apple Park Way to make sure at least Photoshop or Illustrator could be a Day 1 native app.\nThat said, the emulated versions worked fine. Some of my colleagues would never deign to use Photoshop on a MacBook Air. I've used it for minor picture editing for years and the emulated version felt as robust as the native version on my Core i5 Air.\nOne disappointment was that Mac gaming remains, much as it ever was, an afterthought. After some big claims about cult favorite new RPG Baldur's Gate 3 running on M1 Macs, I could not get the Mac version to run via Steam -- I got an error message on each of the M1 Macs I tested. Larian, developer of BG3, tells me that it's working on a Rosetta-ready patch for the Steam version of the game right now.\nEmulating software, especially games, is always a roll of the dice, but at least that's the only app I tried that wouldn't even launch in Rosetta mode. That said, the Steam interface itself ran sluggishly. I hope there's a native version of that in the not-too-distant future as well.\nTesting several other MacOS-compatible games from my Steam and GOG.com libraries, I got two out of six to work, so at the moment, I'd consider this even less of a gaming-friendly machine than its predecessor, but hopefully that's an issue that can be patched or updated away soon.\nBut I wouldn't call that a dealbreaker (unless you're specifically buying a new Mac to play Baldur's Gate 3 right now...). The truth is, the x86 app compatibility on the M1 is night and day different from my experience on Arm-based Windows PCs, including similarly high-end ones like the Surface Pro X. Those Arm-based PCs simply refuse to run all but a modest handful of software and while I like a lot about the Surface Pro X, it's a productivity stopper that got in my way a lot. It was impossible to ever really forget you were using a non-Intel computer, while with the M1 MacBook Air, it was (almost) never an issue.\nCall me a fan of fanless\nOf the three new M1 Macs, the MacBook Air is the most different from its predecessor. That's because the system is finally truly fanless, replacing the cooling fans with an aluminum heat spreader inside, as well as taking advantage of the highly efficient M1 chip, which Apple says will produce less heat, do more work per watt and generally outperform even high-end Intel Macs.\nIf you've never thought of the MacBook Air as a particularly loud laptop, try letting your 9-year-old play Roblox on it for a while; the fan really kicks in. Having a fanless version -- something still rare even in ultrathin Windows laptops -- is a big internal change.\nThe M1 version inside the Air is nearly identical to the ones in the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini. On paper the only difference is that the base model has a seven-core GPU on the SOC versus eight GPU cores in the higher-end M1 machines (including in the higher-end M1 Air config). Previously, there was a lot more daylight between the MacBooks, with the default $999 MacBook Air using a relatively wimpy Intel Core i3 CPU.\nThat's a huge vote in favor of the Air versus the Pro if you're looking for the most performance for the least money. Considering the entry-level $999 (\u00a3999, AU$1,599) M1 MacBook Air and $1,299 (\u00a31,299, AU$1,999) M1 MacBook Pro are both machines with 8GB RAM and 256GB solid-state drives, I know which one I'd suggest as your starting point. For the extra $300 on the Pro, you're getting a slightly brighter screen; the Touch Bar (even as the Air retains the best Touch Bar feature, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor); a few more hours of battery life (according to Apple's claims); and a larger body with \"active cooling,\" otherwise known as a fan, which can allow the M1 MacBook Pro to run at peak speeds for longer without throttling down.\nConsidering the similar benchmark scores, there's a strong case to be made for sticking with the new MacBook Air and throwing in another $200 for either 16GB of RAM or a 512GB SSD. Also worth noting, the M1 versions of the MacBook Pro have the same set of two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. You'll need an upgraded Intel version of the Pro (starting at $1,799) to get back up to four ports.\nIn my hands-on with all three new Macs, you can find more performance and testing details, and find out why the little Mac Mini may be my favorite Mac right now.\nThat's probably the biggest letdown of the new Air -- it's new on the inside, not so much on the outside. Still just two ports. No edge-to-edge screen. No 5G. No touchscreen. Basically, all the things people prognosticate about in new-MacBook-Air prediction lists remain hypothetical. This is a transitional product. Once the new platform and software compatibility are well-established, design and feature changes may follow.\nM1 Macs vs. Intel Macs\n| Geekbench 5 single-core | Geekbench 5 multicore | Cinebench R23 multicore | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| M1 Mac Mini | 1743 | 7704 | 7796 |\n| M1 MacBook Air | 1731 | 7518 | 6822 |\n| M1 MacBook Pro | 1723 | 7457 | 7772 |\n| Core i5 MacBook Pro (13-inch Spring 2020) | 1184 | 4143 | 4703 |\n| Core i5 MacBook Air (Spring 2020) | 1142 | 2912 | 2635 |\nSee also\nI often call the MacBook Air the most universally useful laptop you can buy. The latest version swaps out Intel CPUs with Apple's own M1 chip, but it'll be a transparent transition for most. After all, MacBook Air users are usually looking for a sleek, reasonably priced machine that just works. The system is also finally truly fanless, replacing the cooling fans with an aluminum heat spreader inside, as well as taking advantage of the highly efficient M1 chip. For a base price of $999, and often on sale for at least $100 less, it's a great value, considering these tank-like laptops can last for years."
