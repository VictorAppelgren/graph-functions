  "description": "Unsolicited advice can feel intrusive and disheartening, even when it\u2019s coming from a well-meaning place.",
  "content": "You probably know how intrusive and disheartening unsolicited advice can feel \u2013 even when it\u2019s coming from a well-meaning place.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a colleague chiming in during a meeting to reinterpret the data you\u2019re presenting, leaving you flustered in front of senior leadership. Or perhaps it\u2019s during a one-on-one with your manager, where you\u2019re hoping for empathy, but instead, they turn your challenge into a brainstorming session of strategies they think you should try (based solely on their experience, of course).\n\nWhether it\u2019s someone pointing out flaws without fully understanding your plans, offering advice in areas where you\u2019re the expert, or responding to a simple update with suggestions you didn\u2019t ask for, these moments can feel like a subtle critique of your skills. But here\u2019s the reality: most of the time, these comments aren\u2019t meant to undermine you. More often, they\u2019re an attempt to offer a fresh perspective or be helpful.\n\nAs with many workplace dynamics, balance is key. Staying open to feedback and new ideas is important, but so is trusting your own expertise and instincts. When unsolicited advice becomes overwhelming, misplaced, or chronic, it\u2019s okay to set boundaries in a way that\u2019s both firm and respectful. Here\u2019s how you can stay receptive without feeling overrun.\n\nPresent your ideas as decisions, not discussions.\n\nInstead of saying, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about trying X,\u201d restate it as, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to do X\u2026\u201d This subtle shift signals confidence and clarity, showing that you\u2019re sharing information, not seeking feedback or approval. Phrases like \u201cAfter careful consideration, I\u2019ve committed to\u2026\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward with\u2026\u201d make it clear that your plan is already in motion.\n\nTake Maria\u2019s situation. Rather than saying, \u201cI\u2019m exploring the best way to launch this new initiative,\u201d she could say, \u201cTo successfully launch this initiative, I\u2019m prioritizing corporate sponsorships and advertising.\u201d This flips the dynamic \u2013 instead of inviting unsolicited suggestions, it positions her as a leader with a plan. Now, a colleague like Ben is more likely to ask how he can support her vision rather than offer unsolicited advice.\n\nLeveraging the psychology of social proof is a powerful way to build momentum for your idea. By highlighting early successes or the backing of key stakeholders \u2013 whether it\u2019s higher-ups, external vendors, or partners \u2013 you signal that your idea is already validated and gaining traction. This creates a sense of credibility, making it easier for others to get on board.\n\nYou might say, \u201cWe\u2019ve just started X, and already we\u2019re seeing Y result,\u201d which subtly conveys that you\u2019re on the right track without inviting alternatives. Or, if relevant, emphasize stakeholder support by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve discussed this with [manager/leader]\n\n, and they\u2019re fully on board with moving ahead.\u201d These statements position your idea as not just viable but already in motion, encouraging others to align with your vision.\n\nWhen you need to firmly but politely regain control of a conversation, it\u2019s important to signal that while you value someone\u2019s input, you\u2019re not currently looking for additional ideas. This approach is especially helpful in meetings where time is tight and sticking to the agenda is crucial.\n\nHere are a few phrases to try:\n\u2022 \"I appreciate where you\u2019re going with this, but I need to stick to the current plan to stay on track with our deadlines.\"\n\u2022 \"Thanks for chiming in. For this project, we\u2019ve fully committed to X after careful consideration. We\u2019ll keep your ideas in mind for future phases.\"\n\u2022 \"Those are interesting thoughts. For consistency, we\u2019re going to stick with our current strategy until we gather more data, but I\u2019d be open to revisiting your suggestions in the next phase.\"\n\nAsk directly for what you need.\n\nSet the tone for feedback by clearly outlining the type of input you are open to. This helps avoid misaligned suggestions and keeps the conversation focused. For example:\n\u2022 \u201cAt this stage, I\u2019m specifically looking for feedback on managing the budget, rather than exploring new features.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m excited to share the progress we\u2019ve made so far. For now, I\u2019d like to focus on that rather than brainstorming additional concepts.\u201d\n\nIf someone\u2019s enthusiasm starts to veer off track, guide it toward areas where their input will be most helpful. For instance, \u201cyour expertise could be incredibly valuable on the compliance side. Could we focus there instead of diving further into strategy?\u201d\n\nThis approach not only keeps the discussion aligned with your needs but also ensures the other person feels their contributions are appreciated and purposeful.\n\nWhile unsolicited advice can be irritating, it\u2019s also a chance to stop taking work so personally. When others\u2019 input crosses the line, you\u2019ll be equipped to assert yourself with clarity, kindness, and confidence.",

      "text": "Our jobs often provide more than just a paycheck. They offer purpose, growth, and community. But over time, our professional roles can become deeply intertwined with our sense of self.\nThis is especially true for Sensitive Strivers, people who think and feel everything more deeply. Because of their depth of process, work experiences \u2013 from interactions with colleagues, to daily decisions, or feedback greatly impact their emotions, self-worth, and identity.\nTake Caroline, a recent client of mine. Caroline was the chief of staff to a business school dean, consistently exceeding expectations but struggling with how deeply she internalized every conversation, email, and deliverable. As a natural peace-keeper, Caroline often took on the responsibility of resolving conflicts, sometimes at the expense of her own well-being. Constructive criticism and setbacks hit her hard, causing significant anxiety, especially during tough discussions about budget cuts affecting her department.\nWith so much of our lives invested in our careers, it\u2019s easy to see why work can become such a defining aspect of our identities. While it\u2019s common to equate our personal value with our professional performance, it\u2019s important to step back and gain perspective on how to take things less personally.\nRide the wave\nWhen you take something personally, your mind perceives it as a threat to your competence, social standing, or belonging within a group, triggering a fear response in the brain\u2019s fear center, the amygdala. This can lead to feelings of hurt, defensiveness, anxiety, or anger. While these emotions are natural, the key is to \u201cride the wave\u201d by experiencing them without letting them control your actions.\nTo practice this, try distancing yourself from your feelings with statements like \u201cI am observing this feeling, but I am not defined by it,\u201d or \u201cI can notice this thought without letting it overwhelm me.\u201d By acknowledging your reaction and separating yourself from it, you engage your prefrontal cortex \u2013 the part of the brain responsible for decision-making, problem-solving, and emotional regulation. This creates a space between the triggering event and your response, allowing you to react constructively.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nInterrupt assumptions.\nBefore you let yourself spiral into negativity, pause and ask, \u201cWhat am I making this person\u2019s reaction or the situation mean about me?\u201d This pattern interrupt can help you challenge assumptions and view the situation more objectively.\nTry to consider two or three alternative explanations for someone\u2019s behavior or words. For example, if a colleague seems dismissive in a meeting, instead of assuming they don\u2019t value your input, think about other possibilities. Maybe they had a rough morning or didn\u2019t fully grasp the topic. This helps you avoid jumping to conclusions about your own capabilities \u2013 or lack thereof.\nRather than dwelling on hypothetical explanations, reach out to clarify the other person\u2019s intentions:\n- \u201cI was a bit confused about your comment yesterday. It seemed like you had some concerns. Could you clarify your perspective?\u201d\n- \u201cIn our meeting, when you mentioned [specific topic], I interpreted it as [explain your view]. I want to make sure I understand your point because I value your input.\u201d\n- \u201cI've noticed that in [certain situations], I tend to assume [your interpretation]. I believe in open communication and wanted to share this to understand your side better.\u201d\nBuild your tolerance for discomfort\nInstead of avoiding challenging situations, gradually build your resilience through desensitization\u2014where you expose yourself to discomfort in small, manageable steps. Each time you take a risk and confront an unpleasant emotion, you become better at handling stress and responding calmly. Research shows that exposing yourself to stressors can reduce fear and avoidance by up to 90 percent.\nWhen you choose these challenges yourself, rather than having them forced on you, it boosts your sense of empowerment and self-trust. Facing your fears head-on reshapes your self-perception, helping you see yourself as capable and strong. This might mean volunteering for small opportunities to practice a new skill, proposing ideas even if they're not fully formed, or actively seeking feedback. By putting yourself in the path of discomfort, you go from seeing yourself as weak to recognizing you have what it takes to perform under pressure and rise to challenges.\nFind meaning in failure\nWhen a project doesn\u2019t go as planned, a proposal gets turned down, or a client is unhappy, it\u2019s easy to feel like these setbacks are personal failures. This can lead to frustration and self-doubt. While it\u2019s natural to not enjoy failure, it\u2019s important to find meaning in it. This helps you accept the ups and downs of work without letting them define your self-worth. Instead of asking, \u201cWhy is this happening to me?\u201d try focusing on more constructive questions:\n- What actions can I take next? This shifts you towards a problem-solving mindset and gives you control.\n- What lessons can I draw from this experience? This helps you gain insights and learn from your challenges.\n- How can I grow from this situation? This encourages you to see challenges as opportunities to become more adaptable and resilient.\nDetach from your emotions.\nWhen someone else behaves badly \u2013 like your boss belittling your work or a colleague stealing credit for your ideas \u2013 it's easy to think it\u2019s because of something you did. But often, another person\u2019s reaction is about their own emotional immaturity, not your actions.\nSome clients find it helpful to picture the other person as a scared child or imagine their critical comments in a funny voice. These mental tricks can help you stop taking things personally and instead see the other person\u2019s emotional state.\nTaking things personally at work doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak; it shows your dedication, passion, and strong sense of responsibility."

      "text": "The idea of \"gut feelings\" goes by many different names. Instinct, hunch, inner wisdom...they all refer to the concept of intuition, which is the capacity to instantly understand things without engaging your conscious mind. Everyone's had the experience of immediately knowing a solution or an answer, without being aware of exactly how or why we know.\nThe idea of trusting your gut does not have the best reputation in the age of big data. Researchers use the term \"intuition\" to describe the phenomenon of gut feelings, and many write it off entirely as unreliable, mystical, or \"New Age.\" Though intuition is not always accurate, studies have indicated that by using both gut feelings and analytical thinking at the same time, your decisions are quicker, better, and more accurate than they would be if you left your intuition out of it. And you also feel more confidence in the conclusions you arrive at by way of both analytical thinking and gut instincts. This is doubly true when there is no clear \"right\" answer, or when you're overthinking.\nSurveys of top executives have proven that when most of these leaders are faced with crises, they base their decisions on a blend of both emotional cues and past experiences. Even the U.S. Navy teaches Marines and sailors to listen to their guts, since instinct tends to outperform intellect in combat and other high-stakes situations.\nWhat Science has Proven About Gut Feelings\nContrary to popular belief, intuition is actually a function of the nervous system. Your digestive tract contains 100 million neurons, which comprise an enormous neural network. That's why scientists refer to the digestive system as the \"second brain.\" The gut contains more neurons than the spinal cord, which shows just how powerful its processing abilities really are.\nWhen your decision-making process is driven by intuition, your gut works together with your brain to rapidly call upon all of your past experiences, the knowledge you've gained, and your personal preferences and needs. Then your gut and brain use that information to choose the best course of action. Intuition is an amalgam of experiential and emotional data, and leaders should hold it in high regard.\nRegardless of whether you consult your intuition deliberately, it's likely that you're still benefiting from it on a daily basis. We all know the feeling of evaluating a decision with a pit in our stomach. That's one of the ways that the gut makes its feelings known. By getting a \"read\" on her direct reports, a manager is gauging her team's motivation levels so she can take action to re-engage them if need be. Another example would be \"gut checking\" the design of a new product, which can steer the creative process in the best direction.\nHow to Use Intuition When Making Decisions\nThose who identify as highly sensitive experience gut feelings more strongly than most people, but they're often encouraged to disregard what their gut tells them. High sensitivity allows you to recognize, process, and integrate information on a deep level, including information about the emotions of those around you. Since you are continually taking in more data than the 80% of the population who do not share your trait of high sensitivity, your intuition is more highly developed as a result. Unfortunately, you have probably been encouraged to downplay this data and underutilize this personal strength.\nWhen you deliberately practice using your intuition, you make it stronger. The following tactics can help you start to leverage your intuitive sense as a tool in your decision-making.\nKnow the difference between gut feeling and fear.\nWhen we feel afraid, our bodies tend to chime in with constricting or minimizing sensations. This may include feelings of panic, tension, or desperation. There is the sense of a \"pushing energy,\" like we're struggling to use force, or making a decision out of the desire to sidestep danger, punishment, or being rejected. We also tend to criticize ourselves when we're fearful, with thoughts about how we should be conforming, hiding, or compromising ourselves.\nIntuition brings a \"pulling energy\" with it. Its guidance feels we're maneuvering ourselves in the optimal direction for us \u2013 even if that means taking a risk, or taking our time. Intuition can include the feelings of being at ease or content \u2013 or excited and full of positive anticipation. Your body tends to relax. Gut feelings speak in a voice that's wiser and more grounded, almost like you're listening to a trusted mentor.\nMake small decisions first.\nLet yourself speak up in a meeting without overthinking what you say or holding back. Select an outfit you feel drawn to without considering pros and cons. You can raise your comfort levels with following intuition by making speedy, low-stakes decisions. This avoids overwhelm and lays the groundwork for making bigger, more consequential decisions later on, and trusting yourself as you do so. By starting small, you'll strengthen your abilities to tolerate distress, and to self-regulate your emotions even when you're uncomfortable.\nTake your choices out for a test drive.\nIn your early experiments with intuition, you may find that making choices is a slower process than you'd like. Try role play instead of thinking too much. If you're contemplating a career shift into a new industry, pretend you've already made the decision to go with Option A, and act accordingly. Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions. After doing this for two or three days, try Option B on for size, and act as if you'd decided not to switch industries after all. When the four to six days of role play are done, evaluate your reactions to each possible choice. With simulations of the potential outcomes of a decision, you can get a real sense of which option would give you what you really want. Another option is to flip a coin and check your gut. If you pass up an opportunity because the coin came up tails, how do you feel? Are you full of fear and dread, or joy and relief?\nExperiment with the snap judgment test.\n\"Thin-slicing,\" or utilizing rapid cognition, can let your brain choose without thinking too much, and help you learn to trust your gut more. The snap judgment test will let you try this out. Make a list of questions on paper, like, \"would I find more joy in another line of work?\" Write out \"yes\" and \"no\" below the question, and set the pen down. Wait a few hours, then go back to the page and circle your answer without thinking. You might not like the answer, particularly if it's a big question. But it's likely that the snap judgment test forced you to give an honest answer.\nLean on your values.\nCore values are a reflection of what you value the most. Maybe for you it's family, diversity, calmness, freedom, or stability. Viewing your emotions through the lens of your core values can help you understand why certain events and circumstances trigger negative feelings. For instance, if you feel agitated in the aftermath of a bad day at work, maybe the cause of the tension is the fact that you're hiding how you really feel about an important factor. If one of your core values is honesty, you might find that distressing. By checking in with your values in light of your current circumstances, you can gain insight and determine what's out of balance.\nTake time today to contemplate which one to three values mean the most to you. When you next find yourself facing a difficult decision, consider which outcome is most aligned with your core values. Intuition can relax your inner tension and stave off looping thoughts.\nOne last thing to keep in mind is that intuition doesn't thrive in stressful, fast-paced environments. Let your mind wander and find connections that you couldn't see before. While intuition isn't perfect, it can be a great tool when making decisions. Most people don't use it very much. If you try these strategies, you're likely to come to the conclusion that intuition is a more powerful tool in your decision-making toolkit that you'd ever imagined"

      "text": "Felicia, a project management director, felt physically ill at the thought of giving tough feedback to her team. She believed that as a leader, it should be easy. But as a Sensitive Striver, it felt overwhelming.\nShe managed a diverse team for a global streaming content translation company, excelling in handling multiple tasks and cultural nuances. She was always there for her staff, even taking the blame in situations. However, delivering feedback to her team was Felicia's Achilles' heel. She worried about damaging the relationships she valued so much and spent excessive time overthinking what to say.\nThis fear became evident when a critical project led by Addison, a key team member, failed. Felicia had noticed signs of trouble but didn't voice her concerns, hoping it would resolve itself. This silence led to losing their biggest account to a competitor. Felicia's regret was clear: she felt she could have prevented the failure had she spoken up earlier.\nFearing feedback is common among leaders, especially those who identify as Sensitive Strivers. Concerns about causing tension, demotivating staff, or dealing with emotional reactions are typical. Avoiding conflict might seem easier, but it's harmful in the long-run. Without constructive feedback, the team misses out on growth, and the lack of clear communication can lead to distrust and disengagement.\nUse the following strategies to manage the discomfort and anxiety of tough conversations, so you can communicate confidently.\nReframe binary thinking\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nLeaders who shy away from giving feedback often hold onto all-or-nothing beliefs like \"no one likes being micromanaged\" or \"if I address this issue, it'll ruin our working relationship.\" These views might come from past negative experiences, but they're too simplistic and don't reflect the nuances of workplace dynamics. It's entirely possible to be assertive and straightforward without harming relationships or being labeled as difficult.\nFocus instead on the positive outcomes of speaking up and the benefits of clear communication. Here's what could happen:\n- Your insights might be just what's needed to successfully complete a tough project.\n- A frank conversation about someone's disruptive behavior could lead to a more harmonious and efficient work environment.\n- Offering constructive feedback could help a team member improve, potentially opening up new career paths for them.\nOn closer examination, you'll find that sharing your thoughts, feelings, and opinions is more advantageous than suppressing them and dealing with negative consequences later.\nEmbrace feedback as a positive tool\nContrary to what you might think, your team actually values and needs honest feedback. While 72% of employees find \u201cmanagers giving critical feedback\u201d essential for their career growth, only 5% believe their managers actually provide such feedback. What\u2019s more, teams whose leaders are poor at giving honest feedback often show lower engagement levels. In contrast, leaders who excel at providing candid feedback have teams that are among the highest in terms of engagement.\nWithholding necessary feedback is unfair to your team \u2013 it's crucial for their development. When you start seeing conflict as a normal and required aspect of leadership, it helps reduce the anxiety associated with initiating tough conversations. The next time you need to give feedback, take a moment to breathe and remember: you're not creating conflict, you're facilitating your team's growth. You're not criticizing; you're offering guidance. You're not being a villain; you're being the leader they depend on.\nPrepare for different responses\nThe fear of how someone might react to feedback may stop you from speaking up. You might worry about your team member getting defensive, or even breaking down in tears.\nTo manage this anxiety and uncertainty, use the worst case/best case/most likely scenario tool. First, think about the worst-case scenario and how you'd deal with it. For instance, if your employee starts crying, you might decide to take a break and allow them some space. Next, envision the best possible outcome to bring a sense of optimism. Finally, consider what's most likely to happen, which often falls somewhere between these two extremes. This approach can help you feel more prepared and confident in handling whatever reaction your feedback might elicit.\nNail your opening\nHaving a clear plan for how to start the conversation can significantly reduce your anxiety and help set a positive tone. Taking control from the beginning boosts your confidence and shows respect. For example, when Felicia decided to address the issue with Addison, she began by saying, \u201cI appreciate your dedication and creativity. Something I wanted to talk about is a pattern of low morale, and I want to understand if there are any obstacles that we can address together.\u201d\nUsing \"I\" statements is key to communicate directly and assertively, without downplaying your concerns. Be specific in your feedback. Instead of a vague accusation like \u201cYou dropped the ball again,\u201d opt for a more precise statement, such as \u201cI\u2019m concerned that I didn\u2019t receive the documents in time for the client meeting today.\u201d This approach is more likely to lead to a constructive conversation.\nMake feedback a routine\nFeedback shouldn't be an occasional event; it should be a regular part of your interactions. Regular feedback prevents small issues from escalating into bigger problems. Plus, the more you practice giving feedback in less critical situations, the more comfortable and skilled you'll become at it.\nImplementing systematic feedback can be as simple as consistent one-on-one meetings with your team members. You can also organize project debriefs for collective reflection or pre-mortems to discuss potential risks and challenges before starting a project.\nGetting more comfortable and confident giving tough feedback allows you to practice assertiveness, so you can show up as the strong leader your team needs \u2013 and who you know you can be."

      "text": "Meredith loves her job.\nSometimes, she has to work long hours during the week, but her company has a results-only policy where employees are allowed to work from home as long as their performance and productivity doesn\u2019t falter.\nAfter working at the company for about a year, Meredith decided that she would like to work at home on Fridays. Her boss approved, and like many of my clients, Meredith was excited to have more flexibility in her schedule.\nShe dreamed of spending Summer Fridays with her friends in the city who always got off work at noon, of working remotely at a beach house before a long weekend, or even just having the time to attend an afternoon yoga class that wasn\u2019t as busy as the one at 6pm.\nBut in reality, Meredith was stuck working most Fridays. Though she always reserved (and paid for!) a spot in her favorite yoga class, she rarely made it because a colleague who was at the same level as her had a habit of scheduling meetings last minute.\nIn our coaching session, Meredith was incredibly frustrated because in her mind, she had already asked him to stop. \u201cI sent an email that said, \u2018Don\u2019t you think these meetings would be more productive earlier in the week?\u2019 But I guess he didn\u2019t get it.\u201d\nLike many of the clients I work with, Meredith softened what she really wanted to say because she was afraid of conflict and offending people. Her email didn\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m not available for meetings on Friday afternoons anymore.\u201d That was the boundary she wanted and needed, but couldn\u2019t assert.\nStop Suggesting and Start Asserting\nThe tricky part of assertive communication is that a lot of us think we\u2019re doing it when we aren\u2019t. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone\u2014many people find it challenging to project assertiveness precisely because it requires you to walk a fine line between being pushy and pacifying.\nFor Meredith, I immediately noticed that her first email was passive and came from a passive position: It might be more efficient if\u2026 I asked her to craft a statement that was both diplomatic and constructive, respecting her colleague and offering clear options to help them find a middle ground with getting the meeting scheduled.\nThe next time Meredith\u2019s colleague requested a meeting on Friday afternoon last minute, she waited 15 minutes and then sent a more direct email to the entire team. The email said, \u201cI\u2019m not available to take calls on Fridays. However, since these concerns tend to come up every week, I\u2019ll be adding a recurring meeting to our team calendar on Thursday to handle this moving forward. I\u2019ve taken a look at everyone\u2019s calendars. It seems like 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. is open. Please respond with your preference.\u201d\nInstead of just pushing back, Meredith offered a solution to the team\u2019s problem. In all likelihood, her colleagues probably didn\u2019t like the Friday afternoon meetings very much either.\nBuild a \u201cTo-Don\u2019t List\u201d\nWhen it comes to assertive communication\u2014and communicating about boundaries\u2014you have to get clear on what you want first, before you can share it with other people. A great way to keep your boundaries strong is to create a list of things you don\u2019t want to do anymore or a \u201cTo-Don\u2019t List.\u201d\nGrab a sheet of paper or open a fresh document on your computer. Start with the, \u201cI am no longer going to\u2026\u201d and fill in the blank. Write until you have at least three items down.\nSome examples:\nI am no longer going to be the one who gets the team coffee.\nI am no longer going to always hosts family gatherings.\nI am no longer going to do all the chores at home.\nI am no longer be responsible for reserving conference rooms.\nI am no longer going to distribute materials before a big meeting.\nOnce you have your to-don\u2019t list (and it can be long or short), jot down some initial action steps that you can take to make sure you don\u2019t fall back into the habit of doing these tasks.\nFor example, if Meredith had \u201cI am no longer making myself available for Friday meetings\u201d on her to-don\u2019t list, then she would block out her work calendar on Fridays so that her colleagues could see she was unavailable and not expect her to attend a meeting scheduled on short notice.\nGetting clear on what you will and won\u2019t do is hard, especially for conditioned people-pleasers. But it\u2019s an essential first step to be assertive and get what you want."

  "argos_summary": "Unsolicited advice in the workplace can feel intrusive and undermine confidence, but it often stems from a desire to help. To manage this, individuals can present their ideas as decisions, leverage social proof, and set clear boundaries while remaining open to feedback. Additionally, developing resilience to discomfort, reframing feedback as a growth tool, and practicing assertive communication can empower professionals to navigate challenging conversations and maintain their self-worth.",
