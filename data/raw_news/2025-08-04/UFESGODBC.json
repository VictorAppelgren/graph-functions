  "description": "TOKYO, August 04, 2025-- MUFG Bank, Ltd. announces Consolidated Summary Report for the three months ended June 30, 2025",
  "content": "MUFG is engaged in financial service businesses such as banking business, trust banking business, securities business and credit card/loan businesses. Because there are various uncertainties caused by economic situation, market environments and other factors in these businesses, MUFG discloses a target of its profits attributable to owners of parent instead of a forecast of its performance.\n\nMUFG has an earnings target of 2,000.0 billion yen of profits attributable to owners of parent for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026.(There is no change to our earnings target released on May 15, 2025.)\n\n(*) Revision of forecasts for dividends on the presentation date of this Consolidated Summary Report : None\n\n(1) Changes in significant subsidiaries during the period: No\n\n(2) Adoption of any particular accounting methods for quarterly consolidated financial statements: No\n\n(3) Changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and restatements\n\n(A) Changes in accounting policies due to revision of accounting standards: No\n\n(B) Changes in accounting policies due to reasons other than (A): No\n\n(C) Changes in accounting estimates: Yes\n\n(4) Number of common stocks outstanding at the end of the period\n\n\u203bReview of the Japanese-language originals of the attached consolidated quarterly financial statements by certified public accountants or an audit firm:None\n\n\u203b Notes for using forecasted information etc.\n\n1. This financial summary report contains forward-looking statements regarding estimations, forecasts, targets and plans in relation to the results of operations, financial conditions and other overall management of the company and/or the group as a whole (the \"forward-looking statements\"). The forward-looking statements are made based upon, among other things, the company\u2019s current estimations, perceptions and evaluations. In addition, in order for the company to adopt such estimations, forecasts, targets and plans regarding future events, certain assumptions have been made. Accordingly, due to various risks and uncertainties, the statements and assumptions are inherently not guarantees of future performance, may be considered differently from alternative perspectives and may result in material differences from the actual result. For the main factors that may affect the current forecasts, please see Consolidated Summary Report, Annual Securities Report, Disclosure Book, Annual Report, and other current disclosures that the company has announced.\n\n2. The financial information included in this financial summary report is prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (\"Japanese GAAP\"). Differences exist between Japanese GAAP and the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") in certain material respects. Such differences have resulted in the past, and are expected to continue to result for this period and future periods, in amounts for certain financial statement line items under U.S. GAAP to differ significantly from the amounts under Japanese GAAP. For example, differences in consolidation basis or accounting for business combinations, including but not limited to amortization and impairment of goodwill, could result in significant differences in our reported financial results between Japanese GAAP and U.S. GAAP. Readers should consult their own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between Japanese GAAP and U.S. GAAP and how those differences might affect our reported financial results. To date, we have published U.S. GAAP financial results only on a semiannual and annual basis, and currently do not expect to publish U.S. GAAP financial results for the period reported in this financial summary report.\n\nAbove is part of the Consolidated Summary Report of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. under Japanese GAAP for the three months ended June 30, 2025.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) makes available financial reports and highlights of MUFG group companies including those of MUFG Bank, Ltd.
