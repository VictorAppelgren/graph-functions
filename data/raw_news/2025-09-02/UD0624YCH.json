  "description": "Apple is reportedly developing the Vision Air, its lightweight headset that is more affordable than the Vision Pro.",
  "content": "A new report sheds light on Apple's rumored Vision Air wearable, offering additional details about its expected release date and potential market price.\n\nThe Vision Air is anticipated to be a lower-cost, lighter alternative to the premium Vision Pro headset, which is widely known for its high price and substantial weight.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote on his blog that the Vision Air is expected to launch and be available come 2027, three years after the Vision Pro launched in the United States.\n\nAccording to Kuo, the new Vision Air would potentially be 50% cheaper compared to the Vision Pro. As of writing, the Apple spatial computer wearable costs $3,500.\n\nIf this speculation holds, Vision Air could cost $1,750. This price point would be more accessible to the public and likely boost adoption.\n\nAlongside this, Apple is also speculated to ship as many as one million units of the Vision Air headset by 2027, and it is more than twice as much as the unit production and shipment it completed for the Vision Pro, which was at 400,000 units.\n\nKuo also shared on his blog that the Vision Air is designed to be a lighter headset compared to the Vision Pro. The new Vision Air is said to be 40% lighter.\n\nThis is a massive change for the headset as one of the biggest complaints about it is its weight. Currently, the Vision Pro weighs 21.2 to 22.9 ounces (600 to 650g) alone, with its external battery adding to the damage with 353 grams.\n\nWhat Will Follow the Vision Pro?\n\nShortly after the Vision Pro's release, rumors about its successors and other versions popped up, with one talking about the Vision Pro 2, which will reportedly feature an M5 chipset and be available immediately in 2025.\n\nHowever, it seems like Apple has no plans yet to bring the successor of the Vision Pro to the market. The company, as well as analysts and insiders, has suggest that it will come at a later date.\n\nDespite the long wait for the next iterations of the Vision Pro, reports have suggested that 2025 is going to be a significant year as this will mark the start of these new devices' production.",

      "text": "According to reports, Apple is working on its second-generation vision of its revolutionary Vision Pro headset. Before Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claimed a new roadmap for the budget version of Vision Pro. The latest version is different from this.\nThe new variant is believed to be started in the production line by the second half of 2025, with a substantial performance boost, mainly driven by the expected M5 chip.\nBoosted Performance with M5 Chip\nWhile the design and general features of the second-generation Vision Pro might not differ significantly from the original version, the big news lies in its power processor.\nPopular tech tipster Ming-Chi Kuo says that the current version of Vision Pro sports an M2 chip, while the new variant will be based on the M5 chip. That is a pretty big upgrade in performance terms that would translate into greater interactivity and no lagging inside the headset.\nKuo says the new Vision Pro will have the \"best Apple Intelligence user experience\" thanks to the M5 chip. There isn't clarity on precisely what that would comprise, but it seems like the M5 chip should enable much more complex functionalities and better performance than the M1.\nRead Also: Only 5,000 Users out of 100,000 Buyers Use Rabbit R1 Daily: Is the Hype Going Down?\nWill Apple Intelligence Arrive on the Original Vision Pro?\nSo far, Apple has not made a single suggestion as to whether or not it would be supporting Apple Intelligence on the first-gen Vision Pro. It is already equipped with the M2 chip and caters to iPads and Macs in support of Apple Intelligence\u2014an ensemble of AI-based capabilities that streamline user interaction.\nReferences found by 9to5Mac in codes indicate that the company is currently in development for putting Apple Intelligence on the Vision Pro. Yet, there has not been any declaration of a release date for this upgrade, and the first-gen users remain uncertain whether such an update might come for them.\nExpectations About its Pricing\nKuo believes that the second-gen Vision Pro will probably have a price similar to the first-gen, starting at around $3,499. This high-end positioning places the Vision Pro as a premium product ideal for those seeking the latest AR and VR experiences.\nBesides the costly Vision Pro, Apple is developing another, more affordable version of its headset under the codename \"Apple Vision.\" There is little information about this cheaper variant yet, but including such a product will make it easier for Apple to penetrate the AR and VR market deeper.\nMoreover, the M5-equipped Vision Pro headset will be lighter and boast longer battery life, as per Phone Arena.\nWhat Awaits Apple Vision Pro\nIn light of a probable 2025 release of its second-generation Vision Pro, the tech giant appears more confirmed than ever to be dedicated to furthering innovation in AR and VR. Its promise of supporting the M5 chip will likely mean greater power and possibly a new sense of experiences grounded on AI for these kinds of devices\u2014a first in mixed-reality headsets.\nRelated Article: Apple Vision Pro Now Available for the First Time Outside the US\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "Apple's Vision Pro headset is getting an upgrade this year, and it is reportedly getting the latest M4 chipset that has only been used for Mac and iPads, as well as a better head strap compared to its previous version.\nThis upcoming refresh will not change a lot for the Vision Pro headset apart from a more powerful chipset to power its spatial computing capabilities and improve its comfort for users.\nApple Vision Pro Upgrade: M4 Chip, Better Head Strap\nMark Gurman shared a new report via Bloomberg that claims Apple is now developing a new Vision Pro headset that would get the latest generation Silicon-based chipset, the M4. Before this report, there were no mentions of the M4 chip coming to the Vision Pro as it was previously touted that it would receive the M5 processor in its next upgrade, which is expected in the coming years.\nHowever, Apple reportedly wants to deliver a new headset immediately, and to do this, it will offer an upgrade to its computing power with the M4 chipset from the previous M2 chip, coming with a comfort-focused change as well.\nThere have been previous reports of complaints about the original Vision Pro's head strap, and while it is already enough to keep the headset in place, using it for longer periods could make it bothersome for users.\nThat being said, the chip upgrade also constitutes better processing power and more adept capabilities in running more AI tools for the headset as Apple Intelligence brings more experiences to Vision Pro users.\nVision Pro Upgrade Rumors\nIt has only been a year since Apple released the first XR headset it has, the Vision Pro, and many reports are already focusing on what is coming in the future, including the next-generation version of the device. However, many reports agree on one thing, and that is the so-called 'Vision Pro 2' is not coming this year as it will take more time to develop before releasing its new and improved version.\nHowever, other sources claim that Apple is rushing out the next-generation version of the headset that will feature the M5 chipset, a processor that is expected to arrive this year. Alongside this, Apple CEO Tim Cook also wants to push the cheaper version of the Vision Pro to launch in the near future as it plans to beat Meta Quest at its own game.\nThe original Vision Pro did not sell significantly in the market, and one of the main reasons behind it is the premium price tag that introduced the headset at $3,500 right off the bat. This may or may not change depending on Apple's development of the headset.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission."

      "text": "The latest Apple-made artificial intelligence model, FastVLM, is now available for users to try out, offering a significantly faster video-captioning AI that can describe what the camera captures on one's device.\nReports claim that the AI model's capabilities and features offer near-instant high-resolution image processing, which makes it one of the most notable technologies available for live captioning.\nIt was revealed that Apple has been developing the MLX open framework since 2023, and with the reports about the rumored development of Apple smart glasses, it has been speculated that this technology would be available with the wearable.\nApple's FastVLM Video-Captioning AI Is Now Live\nApple released the FastVLM technology several months ago, according to 9to5Mac, and it leverages a Visual Language Model (VLM), which makes use of the MLX or the ML open framework that was specifically designed for Apple Silicon.\nIn its current iteration, it is 85 times faster for video captioning and is thrice as small as similar models available in the market.\nThe video-captioning AI can provide information on what the camera has captured or come across, offering near-instant responses, according to the report. However, it would require the image to focus on an object that the user wants to be processed before it can come up with the Live Caption information.\nAs of press time, it only has several prompts for the AI to follow for the live captioning feature, including commands like \"Describe what you see in one sentence,\" \"Identify any text or written content visible,\" and more.\nThere's a Catch to Try Apple's FastVLM AI\nUsers may now try the technology via the uploads Apple shared on the Hugging Face repository, and alternatively, use the lighter web-based version, FastVLM 0.5B.\nHowever, it is important to note that this technology was designed for use on Apple Silicon with its MLX framework. Additionally, 9to5Mac reported that the main version of the AI would take a long time to complete its loading despite already using an M2 Mac with 16GB of memory.\nApple's Smart Glasses and AR Tech\nThere have been multiple reports that blew up earlier this year about Apple's development of its very own smart glasses, which will feature a daily wearable that will compete with the Ray-Ban Meta.\nIt was initially claimed that this device would be available come 2026, but further reports claimed that Apple is not yet ready with the technology and is targeting 2027 to debut the wearable alongside the AirPods with cameras.\nThere are also other wearables that were reported to be in the pipeline for Apple's plans to enter the AR market, including new Vision Air device coming next year. The Vision Air would be the lighter-weight version of the Vision Pro XR headset, which is not recommended for everyday use.\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously claimed that Apple is now turning to the world of wearables as it believes that head-mounted wearables is the next major trend in consumer technology.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
