The exercise is part of the Resilience Action Plan, which includes £1 billion for new bio‑security centres and £4.2 billion for flood defences, and follows earlier real alerts such as Storm Éowyn. The test is overseen by COBR to ensure the system can quickly warn citizens and improve national preparedness.",
