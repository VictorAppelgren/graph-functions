  "description": "The company's Alani Nu acquisition is paying off.",
  "content": "\u2022 The Alani Nu brand is seeing strong momentum, particularly with popular LTOs.\n\u2022 However, after the big gains, the stock is no longer in the bargain bin.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Celsius \u203a\n\nIn May, I predicted that a turnaround could be near for Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH), and the company delivered when it recently reported its second-quarter results. The stock shot higher and has now nearly doubled on the year, as of this writing.\n\nThe question now, though, is: Can the stock keep its momentum going, or is it too late to buy the stock? Let's take a closer look at the company's recent results and prospects to find out.\n\nThe biggest reason why I thought a Celsius turnaround was around the corner was due to its acquisition of rival energy drink maker Alani Nu.\n\nAlani Nu had been growing quickly, and that continued in Q2, with the brand's retail sales soaring 129%. Its market share, meanwhile, nearly doubled year over year to 6.3% for the 13 weeks ended June 29, a 3.1-point year-over-year gain. The company credited the strong growth to popular limited-time offerings (LTOs), including Sherbet Swirl and Cotton Candy flavors.\n\nThe Celsius brand was also solid, with revenue growing 9% to $438.1 million and unit sales up 6%. Retail sales increased 3% year over year, but were up 17.6% sequentially. It held an 11% dollar share in the energy drink category, down 130 basis points year over year. For its part, the Celsius brand will launch its first LTO flavors this fall.\n\nOverall company sales climbed 84% to $739.3 million, soaring past analyst expectations for revenue of $655.7 million. Meanwhile, retail sales grew 29% and volume increased 31%.\n\nNorth America sales jumped 87% to $714.5 million, due largely to the addition of Alani Nu. International sales, meanwhile, climbed 27% to $24.8 million, with Celsius seeing strong growth in Australia, the U.K., and France. The company said it is seeing the same fitness trends in international markets as it is in North America, with more females beginning to consume energy drinks.\n\nProfitability was also strong, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soaring 68% to $0.47, well ahead of the $0.21 analyst consensus. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), meanwhile, surged 109% to $220.3 million.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects some margin pressure in the latter half of 2025 due to higher input costs, largely stemming from aluminum tariffs. It will also increase its marketing efforts to help increase brand awareness. This will include its \"Lift.Fit.Go\" campaign, and having its first national TV commercial during NFL games this fall.",

      "text": "Revenue is many things. Commonly known as sales, it\u2019s the top line of the income statement as well as a key financial metric that investors use to measure the financial health of a business. Like any financial metric, there are also rules underpinning the way it\u2019s measured and recorded, and investors should be familiar with these revenue recognition principles.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is revenue?\nPut simply, revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered. In some businesses, revenue is referred to as sales, though it can also come in the form of commissions, premiums, subscriptions, and credit card fees, as well as other channels, depending on the type of business in question.\nRevenue is often used as one way of measuring the size of a business, and investors tend to look at revenue growth as a reflection of a business\u2019s growth rate. Along with profits, or net income, revenue is generally one of the two most important metrics that investors look at in the income statement.\nUnderstanding revenue\nUnderstanding revenue\nRevenue might seem like a simple concept, but the way it\u2019s recorded isn\u2019t always straightforward, and how it\u2019s recorded often depends on the type of business.\nFor some businesses, like retail, revenue is typically recorded when a sale is made, but for other businesses, like software, it\u2019s more complicated. In accrual accounting, the basis for an income statement, revenue is recorded when a service is provided, not when it\u2019s paid for. So the timing of revenue recognition can differ significantly from the timing of cash collection, depending on the type of business and how customers pay their bills. In contract-based businesses like software, customers may pay up front for some products or pay after the services have been provided.\nAccrual accounting is designed to smooth out the lumps that are common in cash-based accounting, making revenue a useful indicator of how a business is performing. However, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on cash flow to make sure that revenue is being converted into cash.\nCash Flow\nHow to use it\nHow to use revenue\nRevenue is a valuable tool for investors, and there are a number of ways it plays into financial analysis. One common usage is in the price-to-sales ratio, which values a stock based on how the share price compares to revenue per share.\nFor profitable companies, investors typically prefer to use the price-to-earnings ratio, but the price-to-sales ratio can help complete the valuation picture since profit margins can vary from quarter to quarter, and profit growth relies on revenue growth. For companies in sectors like software that may not have profits, the price-to-sales ratio is especially valuable since it shows how expensive the stocks are and how they compare to others.\nRevenue growth is also a key metric for investors. In general, revenue growth is the best metric to use to assess a company\u2019s growth rate and potential. Although revenue has to ultimately translate into profits, a stock\u2019s value is closely tied to its top-line growth rate since that offers an indication of the demand for a company\u2019s products and its potential for expansion.\nHow it's calculated\nHow revenue is calculated\nAt its most basic level, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by the quantity sold. If a restaurant sold 20 hamburgers for $10, its revenue would be $200.\nFor most companies, which have multiple product lines and different businesses, calculating revenue is more complex, and the underlying concept is straightforward. Revenue is money that comes in from normal business operations. That\u2019s separate from one-time gains like stock sales, legal proceeds, or interest income for non-financial companies.\nUnderstanding revenue is a valuable tool for any investor, especially as we look forward to the next bull market. Knowing the different ways that businesses recognize revenue is helpful for analyzing individual sectors. Comparing the cash flow statement with revenue is also important to make sure businesses are converting their revenue into cash.\nFinally, looking at metrics like the price-to-sales ratio and revenue growth can help guide your investments; both of those key metrics start with revenue."
