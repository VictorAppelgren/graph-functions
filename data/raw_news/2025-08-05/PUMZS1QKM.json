  "content": "SANTA MARIA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 More than 800 structures are threatened by a massive wildfire in central California that left at least three people injured as it burned through Los Padres National Forest.\n\nThe Gifford Fire scorched more than 113 square miles (293 square kilometers) of coastal Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, with 3% containment, according to a U.S. Forest Service update on Monday evening.\n\nMore than 1,900 personnel are battling the blaze that grew out of at least four smaller fires that erupted Friday along State Route 166 between Santa Maria and Bakersfield. The causes of the fires are under investigation.\n\nThe National Weather Service\u2019s Los Angeles office has warned that the fire continued to generate considerable smoke that will affect parts of Southwest California, noting that wildfire smoke is a health risk. Smoke was expected to move toward the south and east.\n\nThe blaze threatened about 872 structures and forced the closure of the highway in both directions east of Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000 people in Santa Barbara County. About 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of Santa Barbara and 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, the hilly agricultural region is dotted by sprawling California live oaks and Sycamore trees and is known for its wine industry.\n\nFirefighters made great progress on the west, north and east flanks of the fire and significant efforts were made to ensure structure protection on the south end, officials said in an update Monday evening. Two new base camps were being established on the north and east sides of the fire, allowing more efficient access to the fire perimeter. Officials said they expected more helicopters to be able to deliver significant water drops on Tuesday with a drone doing reconnaissance.\n\nA warming and drying trend was expected to continue from Wednesday through the weekend, with temperatures up to 90 to 100 degrees on Thursday and Friday, with increasing fire behavior, officials said.\n\nA motorist was hospitalized with burn injuries after getting out of his vehicle and being overrun by flames, U.S. Forest Service spokesperson Flemming Bertelson said. Two contract employees assisting firefighters were also hurt when their all-terrain vehicle overturned.\n\nRanchers evacuated cattle Monday as aircraft made water drops on the encroaching flames.",

      "text": "Smoke from Canadian wildfires brings unhealthy air to large swaths of the Midwest\nSmoke from Canadian wildfires brings unhealthy air to large swaths of the Midwest\nSmoke from Canadian wildfires hovered over several Midwestern states Saturday, bringing warnings of unhealthy air for at least the third day.\nAir quality alerts were in effect in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, as well as eastern Nebraska and parts of Indiana and Illinois. Forecasters said the smoky skies would remain for much of the day.\nCanadian environmental officials said smoke from the forest fires would persist into Sunday for some areas.\nThe Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir, which assesses air quality in real time, listed the city of Minneapolis as having some of the worst air pollution in the world since Friday. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was expected to reach the red or unhealthy category in a large swath of Minnesota.\nAQI is a system used to communicate how much air pollution is in the air. It breaks pollution down into six categories and colors, along with advice on what is and is not safe to do. They range from \u201cgood\u201d (the color green) to \u201chazardous\u201d (maroon).\nPeople with lung disease, heart disease, children, older adults and pregnant women are most susceptible to the poor breathing conditions.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been unique in this go-around is that we\u2019ve had this prolonged stretch of smoke particulates towards the surface, so that\u2019s where we\u2019ve really had the air quality in the red here for the past few days,\u201d said Joe Strus, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area in Minnesota.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sort of been dealing with this, day in and day out, where you walk outside and you can taste the smoke, you can smell it,\u201d Strus said. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ve been in higher concentrations than others. Other times it\u2019s just looked a little hazy out there.\u201d\nThe air was improving Saturday, he said, specifically across the Twin Cities and southwestern Minnesota, but state health officials warned that conditions could remain unhealthy for sensitive groups through Monday.\nOfficials said the smoke could spread as far south as Tennessee and Missouri.\nThe EPA\u2019s Air Quality Index converts all pollutant levels into a single number. The lower the number, the better. Anything below 50 is classified as \u201chealthy.\u201d Fifty to 100 is \u201cmoderate\u201d while 100-150 is unhealthy for \u201csensitive groups.\u201d Anything above 150 is bad for everyone. Parts of Minnesota exceeded that number on Saturday.\nHealth officials advise people with asthma and other lung disease, heart disease, children and older adults to avoid prolonged exposure to smoke and limit strenuous activities. They said to avoid burning things that could make the air pollution worse and to keep windows and doors closed.\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s become part of our summer here the last few years,\u201d Strus said, \u201cand I think a lot of us are just looking forward to seeing a little more movement in the atmospheric winds and we\u2019ll be able to hopefully disperse some of the smoke out of here in the next few days.\u201d\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

      "text": "How to protect yourself from the bad air caused by wildfires\nWhen wildfires burn, the smoke can travel long distances and degrade air quality far away, which presents risks for those breathing it.\nFires burning in one state can make air worse several states away, and wildfires in Canada can send smoke into U.S. cities.\nHere\u2019s what to know about taking precautions against poor air quality due to wildfires.\nWhat counts as bad air?\nThe EPA\u2019s Air Quality Index converts all pollutant levels into a single number. The lower the number, the better.\nAnything below 50 is classified as \u201chealthy.\u201d Fifty to 100 is \u201cmoderate\u201d while 100-150 is unhealthy for \u201csensitive groups,\u201d and anything above 150 is bad for everyone.\nSensitive groups include people with asthma, lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said Dr. Sanjay Sethi, chief of the division of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Buffalo\u2019s medical school.\n\u201cIf you have heart or lung problems, then you\u2019ve got to be definitely more careful,\u201d Sethi said. \u201cI would either avoid going outside or wear an N95 (mask) or at least a dust mask.\u201d\nIs my air unhealthy?\nSometimes the air is bad enough to see or smell the smoke. Even if you don\u2019t see the pollution, it can be unhealthy to breathe.\nThe EPA maintains a website with up-to-date, regional air quality information. PurpleAir, a company that sells air quality sensors and publishes real-time air quality data, has a citizen scientist, air quality monitoring network with a more granular map of street-by-street air quality readings.\nThe best way to get indoor air quality readings is to buy a monitor, said Joseph Allen, director of Harvard University\u2019s Healthy Buildings Program.\n\u201cYou can find these low-cost, indoor air quality monitors just about everywhere online now. They don\u2019t cost all that much anymore,\u201d he said.\nWhat if I have to go outside?\nFor most people, going outside for just a short time won\u2019t have a negative long-term impact, said Sethi.\nWearing an N95 mask, which became common during the coronavirus pandemic, will help filter out the pollution.\n\u201cN95 is going to get rid of 90-95% of the particles,\u201d said Jennifer Stowell, a research scientist at Boston University\u2019s Center for Climate and Health. \u201cIf you have access to a mask that has a respirator-type attachment to it, then that\u2019s the very best.\u201d\nIf you must be outside and you experience symptoms, experts say you should head indoors or somewhere else with better air quality. Even if you are healthy, it\u2019s good to take precautions.\n\u201cIf you start wheezing, which is like this whistling sound of the chest, or if you\u2019re feeling short of breath, that\u2019s definitely more concerning,\u201d Sethi said.\nHow do I make my air cleaner?\nClose the windows and turn on the air conditioner, if you have one, setting it to circulate the indoor air. Use blankets to cover cracks that allow outside air into your home, such as under doors.\nFinally, swapping the air conditioner\u2019s filter for a MERV 13 filter can help, though you should make sure it\u2019s installed correctly.\n\u201cIf you happen to have access to an air purifier, even if it\u2019s just a room air purifier, try to keep it running and in the room that you\u2019re doing most of your activities in,\u201d said Stowell.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
