      "feedback": "The draft misses a key legal‑risk driver (ICJ opinion → ust10y ↑ → spx ↓, dxy ↑, gold ↑) and the COP30 catalyst window; add a Down item for spx with a 1‑2 % range and 35 % probability tied to COP30 outcomes. Tighten the Fed‑cut Up item to 0.5‑1 % (≈ +30‑60 pts) with a 90 % probability for the Sept 16‑17 FOMC (D0R3LX8F7)(XHDE9MSFQ). Merge the “Fed hawkish stance or tariff” Down item into a single 1‑2 % downside with 50 % probability, citing tariff announcement (VDO8D9T7M) and Fed policy (D0R3LX8F7). For tokenization, state a 0.3‑1 % upside with 60 % probability, linking to tokenized trade volume growth (XQMF22EFB). For stablecoin fragmentation, specify a –0.2 to –0.4 % downside with 40 % probability, citing stablecoin fee spikes (XQMF22EFB). Ensure each line maps to a canonical handle (spx, ust10y, dxy, gold) and includes a clear causal chain and catalyst window. Add inline IDs for every factual claim, avoid generic wording, and keep each line to one sentence.",
