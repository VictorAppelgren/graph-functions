  "title": "Trump delays China tariffs another 90 days, extending trade truce hours before deadline",
  "description": "A previous negotiation deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Monday, Aug. 11, 2025, in Washington. AP Photo/Alex Brandon\n\nPresident Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\n\nTrump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that \u201call other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.\u201d\n\nThe previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Had that happened the U.S. could have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China.\n\nThe pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. companies doing business with China.\n\nSean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the extension is \u201ccritical\u201d to give the two governments time to negotiate a trade agreement that U.S. businesses hope would improve their market access in China and provide the certainty needed for companies to make medium- and long-term plans.\n\n\u201cSecuring an agreement on fentanyl that leads to a reduction in U.S. tariffs and a rollback of China\u2019s retaliatory measures is acutely needed to restart U.S. agriculture and energy exports,\u201d Stein said.\n\nReaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 on almost every country on earth.\n\nThe European Union, Japan and other trading partners agreed to lopsided trade deals with Trump, accepting once unthinkably U.S. high tariffs (15% on Japanese and EU imports, for instance) to ward off something worse.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade policies have turned the United States from one of the most open economies in the world into a protectionist fortress. The average U.S. tariff has gone from around 2.5% at the start of the year to 18.6%, highest since 1933, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nBut China tested the limits of a U.S. trade policy built around using tariffs as a cudgel to beat concessions out of trading partners. Beijing had a cudgel of its own: cutting off or slowing access to its rare earths minerals and magnets \u2013 used in everything from electric vehicles to jet engines.\n\nIn June, the two countries reached an agreement to ease tensions. The United States said it would pull back export restrictions on computer chip technology and ethane, a feedstock in petrochemical production. And China agreed to make it easier for U.S. firms to get access to rare earths.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has realized it does not have the upper hand,\u2019\u2019 said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter and former assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs.\n\nIn May, the U.S. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they\u2019d slapped on each other\u2019s products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S.\n\nThose triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In a May meeting in Geneva they agreed to back off and keep talking: America\u2019s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China\u2019s to 10%.\n\nHaving demonstrated their ability to hurt each other, they\u2019ve been talking ever since.\n\n\u201cBy overestimating the ability of steep tariffs to induce economic concessions from China, the Trump administration has not only underscored the limits of unilateral U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,\u2019\u2019 said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. \u201dThe administration\u2019s desire for a trade d\u00e9tente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Washington and Beijing can reach a grand bargain over America\u2019s biggest grievances. Among these are lax Chinese protection of intellectual property rights and Beijing\u2019s subsidies and other industrial policies that, the Americans say, give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in world markets and have contributed to a massive U.S. trade deficit with China of $262 billion last year.\n\nReade doesn\u2019t expect much beyond limited agreements such as the Chinese saying they will buy more American soybeans and promising to do more to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl and to allow the continued flow of rare-earth magnets.\n\nBut the tougher issues will likely linger, and \u201cthe trade war will continue grinding ahead for years into the future,\u2019\u2019 said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy.",

      "text": "Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. government, a U.S. government official has confirmed.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China back in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development.\nThe official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss a policy not yet formally announced, confirmed to The Associated Press the revenue sharing terms of the deal, and said the broad strokes of the initial report by The Financial Times were accurate.\nThe FT reports that Nvidia and AMD agreed to the financial arrangement as a condition for obtaining export license to resume sales to China.\nNvidia did not comment about the specific details of the agreement or its quid pro quo nature, but said they would adhere to the export rules laid out by the administration.\n\u201cWe follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven\u2019t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,\u201d Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. \u201cAmerica cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America\u2019s AI tech stack can be the world\u2019s standard if we race.\u201d\nAMD did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThe top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it \u201ca dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.\u201d\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.\n\u201cOur export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,\u201d he said. \u201cChip export controls aren\u2019t bargaining chips, and they\u2019re not casino chips either. We shouldn\u2019t be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.\u201d\nMore business\n- Trump delays China tariffs another 90 days, extending trade truce hours before deadline\n- Intel CEO meets with Trump after the president\u2019s call for his resignation\n- Yes, AOL still offers dial-up internet.

They\u2019ve argued that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology, and have also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia\u2019s chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets.\nRestrictions on sales of advanced chips to China have been central to the AI race between the world\u2019s two largest economic powers, but such controls are also controversial. Proponents argue that these restrictions are necessary to slow China down enough to allow U.S. companies to keep their lead. Meanwhile, opponents say the export controls have loopholes \u2014 and could still spur innovation. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January particularly renewed concerns over how China might use advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.\n-- The Associated Press"

      "text": "AOL\u2019s dial-up internet is finally taking its last bow.\nYes, while perhaps a dinosaur by today\u2019s digital standards, dial-up is still around. But AOL says it\u2019s officially pulling the plug for its service on Sept. 30.\n\u201cAOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet,\u201d AOL wrote in a brief update on its support site \u2014 noting that dial-up and associated software \u201coptimized for older operating systems\u201d will soon be unavailable on AOL plans.\nAOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the world wide web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s. The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone used to connect your computer online \u2014 along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.\nEventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up\u2019s quirks for most people accessing the internet today.\nStill, a handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.\nAOL was the largest dial-up internet provider for some time, but not the only one to emerge over the years. Some smaller internet providers continue to offer dial-up today. Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet\u2019s earlier days continue to disappear.\nMore business\n- Trump delays China tariffs another 90 days, extending trade truce hours before deadline\n- Intel CEO meets with Trump after the president\u2019s call for his resignation\n- China-US tariff deadline looms: Will 90-day pause be extended?\n- Nvidia, AMD to share 15% of China chip revenue with US government\n- Small Oregon county reckons with fallout from data center scandal\nMicrosoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year, for example \u2014 as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022.

It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL\u2019s market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL \u2014 which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.\n-- Wyatte Grantham-Philips, The Associated Press"

      "text": "UPDATE: Trump delays China tariffs another 90 days, extending trade truce hours before deadline\nA 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended.\nAfter the most recent round of China-U.S. trade talks, held late last month in Stockholm, Chinese and U.S. officials said they expected the deadline to be extended for another 90 days. The U.S. side said the decision was up to President Donald Trump. So far there has been no formal announcement about whether he will endorse an extension or push ahead with the higher tariffs.\nThe uncertainty has left businesses in limbo and a decision to raise the import duties could jolt world markets.\nSilence from Washington and Beijin\nTrump has repeatedly shifted deadlines and tariff rates, and neither side has indicated what it plans for Tuesday. Extending the Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl.\nHigher tariffs are aimed at offsetting the huge, chronic U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a 21-year low in July as the threat of tariffs bit into Chinese exports.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. to give hints on where talks stand, but it\u2019s rare for China to make announcements until major decisions are set. So far, Beijing\u2019s refrained from commenting ahead of Tuesday\u2019s deadline.\nIn an interview with Fox News taped on Thursday but aired on Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Trump was considering additional tariffs on Beijing because of China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil. But he said Trump \u201chasn\u2019t made any firm decisions.\u201d\nChina resisted cutting an early bargain\nProhibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market. Lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have left millions of people reliant on \u201cgig work,\u201d crimping the job market. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have also hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated,\nBut the U.S. relies heavily on imports from China for all sorts of products, from household goods and clothing to wind turbines, basic computer chips, electric vehicle batteries and the rare earths needed to make them. That gives Beijing some powerful leverage in the negotiations with Washington.\nEven with higher tariffs, China remains competitive for many products. And its leaders are aware that the U.S. economy is only just beginning to feel the effects of higher prices from Trump\u2019s broad tariff hikes.\nFor now, imports from China are subject to a 10% baseline tariff and a 20% extra tariff related to the fentanyl issue. Some products are taxed at higher rates. U.S. exports to China are subject to tariffs of around 30%. Before the two sides called a truce, Trump had threatened to impose 245% import duties on Chinese goods. China retaliated by saying it would hike its tariff on U.S. products to 125%.\nMuch is at stake\nA trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies has ramifications across the global economy, affecting industrial supply chains, demand for commodities like copper and oil and geopolitical issues such as the war in Ukraine.\nAfter a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in June, Trump said he hoped to meet with Xi later this year. That\u2019s an incentive for striking a deal with Beijing.\nMore business\n- Trump delays China tariffs another 90 days, extending trade truce hours before deadline\n- Intel CEO meets with Trump after the president\u2019s call for his resignation\n- Yes, AOL still offers dial-up internet.

Businesses would refrain from making investment commitments and hiring, while inflation would surge higher.\nCompanies are in an \u201cextended wait-and-see mode,\u201d Oxford Economics said in a recent report.\n-- Christopher Bodeen, The Associated Press"

She and another commissioner critical of officials\u2019 dealings with Amazon lost a recall election and were kicked out of office.\nA measure of redemption came last month, when the Oregon Department of Justice filed a civil complaint alleging that several officials in the eastern Oregon county \u201cabused their authority and breached the public trust for their personal financial gain.\u201d\nThe state alleges that public officials pocketed several million dollars by arranging to buy a local telecommunications business from a Morrow County nonprofit. The officials, who had voted to grant Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks, allegedly paid far less for the telecom business than it was really worth by hiding the value of its contracts with the tech giant.\nWhen Oregon\u2019s attorney general weighed in last month, Lindsay said the litigation served as a kind of wakeup call in the small community.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten apologies left and right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty crazy.\u201d\nAttorneys for the defendants didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment and haven\u2019t filed a legal response to the state\u2019s civil charges. But Lindsay says the state\u2019s case raises broader issues about how Oregon awards tax incentives and how it ensures officials are acting in the public\u2019s interest.\n\u201cNegotiating away our tax dollars to make money in such a blatant way, it\u2019s a different level of accountability to me,\u201d Lindsay said.\nLawsuit alleges \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019\nAmazon has spent several billion dollars building and equipping data centers in Morrow County, a community of 13,000 residents about 160 miles east of Portland along the Columbia River.\nThe company negotiated with the county, the Port of Morrow and the city of Boardman for tax incentives, land and water. Amazon\u2019s property tax breaks were worth nearly $70 million last year alone and will cumulatively tally well over $1 billion in the years ahead.\nThe attorney general\u2019s case focuses on former port and county officials, who paid $2.6 million in 2018 for a local fiber-optic provider called Windwave Communications. The Oregonian/OregonLive scrutinized the transaction in a 2022 article, triggering the state investigation that led to last month\u2019s civil charges.\nWindwave\u2019s previous owner had been a nonprofit called Inland Development Corp., established to provide internet service to small businesses, hospitals, schools, libraries and other public agencies in the rural community.\nThe Oregon Department of Justice says the officials \u201cdeliberately withheld financial information\u201d about Windwave\u2019s dealings with Amazon and how valuable those contracts were to the fiber-optic business.\nWindwave\u2019s owners are former port commissioners Jerry Healy and Marv Padberg, former county commissioner Don Russell, former port director Gary Neal and Blake Lawrence, CEO of the fiber business. All five are named as defendants in the Department of Justice\u2019s complaint.\nWindwave was worth at least $6.9 million more than the buyers paid, according to the July complaint, money that should have been used for Inland\u2019s nonprofit mission instead of the \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d of local officials. The Department of Justice wants the defendants to pay the difference, and says it may seek punitive damages, too.\n>> Windwave: Here are the defendants\nAll four of the public officials have since left office. One retired, two didn\u2019t seek re-election and one lost his re-election bid. Three agreed to pay $2,000 apiece to settle an ethics complaint that alleged they had sometimes failed to disclose conflicts between their ownership in Windwave and their dealings with Amazon.\nThe defendants in the state\u2019s case also include three members of Inland\u2019s board, whom the state accuses of failing to exercise proper oversight in signing off on the deal though they didn\u2019t profit from it personally.\nState Rep. Greg Smith was among those board members and was allegedly inattentive at board meetings leading up to Windwave\u2019s sale. Smith, a Republican from Heppner, has not responded to inquiries about his role in the case. But in a Facebook post last month, he defended his actions \u2014 and the sale.\n\u201cIt did not occur to me to ponder if anyone was being deceitful or untruthful,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cI still do not believe anyone was.\u201d\n>> Windwave: A timeline of the case\nThe state has not charged Amazon itself. The company says it acted appropriately in its dealings in Morrow County, though Amazon has refused to say if it was aware that it was negotiating its tax breaks with public officials who also owned Amazon\u2019s local fiber-optic provider.\nTime to heal?\nMorrow County has been riven by a long string of controversies over the past several years, most prominently nitrate pollution from farm fertilizer, animal manure and wastewater that has contaminated local drinking water.\nThe county has also weathered bitter disagreements over managing emergency services, among other issues, which have pitted residents against one another as the data center scandal was percolating.\nHeppner Mayor Corey Sweeney had no role in the Windwave saga and said he believes county residents are ready to put it behind them.\n\u201cFrom what I see, people want to heal. They want to move on to work with each other and forget about the past and move forward,\u201d he said.\nPort of Morrow Chairman John Murray didn\u2019t take office until 2019, the year after Windwave\u2019s sale. He declined to comment on the allegations and said he considers it a part of the past.\n\u201cThe Port of Morrow is on the right path right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe commissioners that are on the commission now are very well aware of their responsibility for ethical behavior.\u201d\nOthers, though, say they are pleased to see the Windwave issue getting fresh scrutiny. That includes Rep. Bobby Levy, R-Echo.\n\u201cMelissa Lindsay, dear, we all knew it would come out and the truth would be known. I\u2019m sorry it took this long!\u201d Levy wrote on Lindsay\u2019s Facebook page after the former commissioner posted news of the state\u2019s charges in the Windwave case.\nIn a subsequent email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, Levy said her post was not intended to reflect on her House colleague, Rep. Smith. She said the next steps in the case are up to Attorney General Dan Rayfield and declined to comment further.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a long time coming,\u201d said Jim Doherty, another former county commissioner who also lost his job in the recall election after speaking out about the Windwave deal.\nThe state\u2019s case against former Morrow County officials has awakened the community, Doherty said, and residents are starting to feel freer to express concerns about other issues.\n\u201cFolks are starting to empower themselves and realize there are some avenues to fight back and to peel back what\u2019s gone on,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s important, Doherty said, that state officials exercise oversight of economic development efforts \u201cto ensure what they\u2019re doing is in the best interests of the public and not for the benefit of their own pocketbook.\u201d\nOregon law gives the state\u2019s economic development agency, known as Business Oregon, little role in overseeing local tax breaks. It doesn\u2019t put a ceiling on how much local governments can give away or require that the size of the incentives be tied to job growth.\nIn the Windwave case, the Oregon Department of Justice stepped in to investigate. In the civil case, the state\u2019s attorneys suggest one possible remedy for the alleged abuses would be to unwind the Windwave deal from 2018 and return the business to Inland, the nonprofit.\nThat\u2019s what Doherty wants.\n\u201cThe DOJ has to go back and void the sale and get back all the ill-gotten gains,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the only justice there.\u201d\nThe last three years have been personally difficult, Doherty said, but he views the state\u2019s case against Windwave\u2019s buyers as evidence that speaking up will pay dividends \u2014 eventually.\n\u201cStaying in the right path and doing the right thing is what you ultimately have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you will be rewarded. It may be down the road.\u201d"

      "text": "US and China reach a deal to slash sky-high tariffs for now, with a 90-day pause\nUS and China reach a deal to slash sky-high tariffs for now, with a 90-day pause\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 The United States and China agreed Monday to slash their massive recent tariffs, restarting stalled trade between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and setting off a rally in global financial markets.\nBut the de-escalation in President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars did nothing to resolve underlying differences between Beijing and Washington. The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Trump imposed last month to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.\nA deal averts a total blockade\nGreer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the tariff reductions at a news conference in Geneva.\nThe officials struck a positive tone as they said the two sides had set up consultations to continue discussing their trade issues. Bessent said that the triple-digit tariffs the two countries imposed on each other last month \u2014 in an escalation of tensions Trump started \u2014 amounted to \u201cthe equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade.\u2019'\nThe delegations, escorted around town and guarded by scores of Swiss police, met for at least a dozen hours on both days of the weekend at a sunbaked 18th-century villa that serves as the official residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva.\nAt times, the delegation leaders broke away from their staffs and settled into sofas on the villa\u2019s patios overlooking Lake Geneva, helping deepen personal ties in the effort to reach a much-sought deal.\nFinally, a deal\nThe 30% levy that America is now imposing on Chinese goods includes an existing 20% tariff intended to pressure China into doing more to prevent the the synthetic opioid fentanyl from entering the United States. It also includes the same 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 tariff Trump has slapped on imports from most of the world\u2019s countries. The 30% tax comes on top of other levies on China, including some left over from Trump\u2019s first term and kept by former President Joe Biden.\nTrump had ratcheted the combined tariff to 145% last month, furious that China was retaliating, before backing down Monday.\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry called the agreement an important step for the resolution of the two countries\u2019 differences and said it lays the foundation for further cooperation.\n\u201cThis initiative aligns with the expectations of producers and consumers in both countries and serves the interests of both nations as well as the common interests of the world,\u201d a ministry statement said.\nChina hopes the U.S. will stop \u201cthe erroneous practice of unilateral tariff hikes\u201d and work with China to safeguard the development of economic and trade relations, injecting more certainty and stability into the global economy, the ministry said.\nThe joint statement by the two countries said China also agreed to suspend or remove other measures it has taken since April 2 in response to the U.S. tariffs. China has increased export controls on rare earths, including some critical to the defense industry, and added more American companies to its export control and unreliable entity lists, restricting their business with and in China.\nMarkets rally as two sides de-escalate\nThe full impact on the complicated tariffs and other trade penalties enacted by Washington and Beijing remains unclear. And much depends on whether they will find ways to bridge longstanding differences during the 90-day suspension.\nBessent said in an interview with CNBC that U.S. and Chinese officials will meet again in a few weeks.\nBut investors rejoiced as trade envoys from the world\u2019s two biggest economies blinked.\nFutures for the S&P 500 jumped 2.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2%. Oil prices surged more than $1.60 a barrel, and the dollar gained against the euro and the Japanese yen.\n\u201cThis is a substantial de-escalation,\u201d said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. But he warned \u201cthere is no guarantee that the 90-day truce will give way to a lasting ceasefire.\u201d\nDani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard University, said that the two countries had stepped back \u201cfrom a needless trade war\u2019\u2019 but that U.S. tariffs on China remain high at 30% \u201cand will mainly hurt U.S. consumers.\u2019\u2019\n\u201cTrump has obtained absolutely nothing from China for all the chaos he generated. Zilch,\u2019\u2019 Rodrik wrote, posting on Bluesky.\nCraig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the speed at which the agreement came about suggested that \u201cboth sides were more economically boxed in than they let on.\u201d\n\u201cFor China, the economic pain was real: Rising unemployment, capital flight, and export orders falling at their fastest rate in nearly two years,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cFor Trump, markets mattered, and this deal gives him a win without abandoning leverage.\u201d\nThe announcement by the U.S. and China sent shares surging, with U.S. futures jumping more than 2%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index surged nearly 3%, and benchmarks in Germany and France were both up 0.7%\n\u201cThe drop from sky-high to merely high tariffs, along with the uncertainty about the path of future tariffs, will still serve as a constraint on trade and investment flows between the two economies,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\n\u201cNevertheless, it is a positive omen for the world economy that U.S. tariffs might eventually end up as significant trade barriers but not unsurmountable walls,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nJay Foreman \u2014 CEO of Basic Fun, the Florida-based company behind such toys as Care Bears and Tonka trucks \u2014 said he was relieved to see the tariff rate on Chinese goods now down to 30%. But he wants that to drop to 10%.\nForeman said he\u2019d just advised his team in China to release its toy shipments, which had been paused since early April. Before Monday\u2019s deal, he said, he thought he\u2019d have to double prices \u2014 but they\u2019ll still go up, by 10% to 15% for the third and fourth quarters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they tried to feed us a rotten egg sandwich and hope we\u2019re happy to drink spoiled milk instead,\u201d Foreman said.\n___\nMcHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany; Kurtenbach from Mito, Japan; and Moritsugu from Beijing.

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump has extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days, delaying potential tariff increases that could have escalated tensions between the two largest economies. This extension allows time for negotiations aimed at resolving key issues, including tariffs and trade imbalances, which have seen U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods rise significantly. Meanwhile, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share a portion of their revenues from sales to China with the U.S. government, raising concerns about the implications for national security and export controls.",
