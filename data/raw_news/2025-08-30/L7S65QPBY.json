  "title": "Should you draft Quinshon Judkins in fantasy? What to know about RB's status",
  "description": "Quinshon Judkins remains unsigned ahead of the 2025 NFL season. Can fantasy football managers trust the Browns RB?",
  "content": "Fantasy football managers are always searching for quality depth at running back. The position tends to get thin during the season, so loading up on the position and selecting players with paths to potential workhorse roles is something managers often do during their fantasy drafts.\n\nThat's why some will be tempted to target Cleveland Browns running back Quinshon Judkins ahead of the fantasy football season. The 2025 second-round pick was expected to take on a big role in Cleveland's running back room after posting three seasons with at least 1,000 yards and 14 touchdowns across three college seasons at Ole Miss and Ohio State.\n\nHowever, Judkins' status for the start of the 2025 NFL season remains murky. He isn't injured, but he remains unsigned by the Browns as the parties navigate some off-the-field concerns and a contract dispute.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Judkins will play in 2025 and whether you should target him in fantasy football drafts.\n\nIt isn't clear whether or when Judkins will play in 2025. The 21-year-old remains unsigned by the Browns even after the Broward County State Attorney's Office announced Aug. 14 it was declining to move forward with a misdemeanor battery charge against him.\n\nNeither coach Kevin Stefanski nor the Browns organization have provided an update about when the second-round pick might ink his rookie contract.\n\nJudkins was the 36th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, which gives him a slot value of just under $11.39 million, per Spotrac.com.\n\nHowever, many NFL second-round picks remained unsigned long-term during the offseason as they attempted to negotiate fully guaranteed contracts. Seven players were successful in those goals, including fellow Browns second-rounder and No. 33 overall pick, linebacker Carson Schwesinger.\n\nJudkins remaining unsigned \"may or may not have to do with the full guarantee,\" Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com reports.\n\nEither way, as long as Judkins remains unsigned, his status for the 2025 NFL season will remain murky.\n\nShould you draft Quinshon Judkins in fantasy football?\n\nIt's hard to recommend taking Judkins as anything other than a speculative, late-round flier as he remains unsigned.\n\nJudkins certainly has talent. He was the third running back selected in the 2025 NFL Draft behind only first-round picks Ashton Jeanty and Omarion Hampton. It was expected the powerful 5-11, 211-pound running back would have a chance to earn the starting job in Cleveland's backfield and emerge as a potential RB2 with good volume.\n\nBut Judkins missed all of Cleveland's training camp and the preseason after his July 12 arrest in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence and battery. The charges were dropped on Aug. 14, but he and the team still haven't yet agreed to terms on his rookie contract.\n\nAs such, Judkins remains off the field in the week leading up to the 2025 NFL season. Even if the two parties can reach an agreement before Week 1, it may take the rookie time to work into playing shape and get up to speed enough in the Browns' offense to be a factor for them.\n\nWith that in mind, it will probably be a while before Judkins is able to emerge as a fantasy football factor. That makes his FantasyPros average draft position (ADP) of RB32 a bit rich, though patient fantasy managers could potentially benefit if they are able to keep Judkins until the second half of the season.\n\nVerdict: Judkins has potential if he can get on the field, but without knowing when he might be available, it's hard to trust him as anything more than a speculative bench flier. He's being drafted more as an RB3, but fantasy managers should balk at that price given the uncertainty surrounding him.\n\nThe Browns currently have three running backs on their 53-man roster and five in their organization as a whole. Below is a look at their available running backs:\n\nJudkins figures to occupy a top-three spot on Cleveland's depth chart once he signs. Still, it isn't clear how quickly he might be able to leapfrog Ford and fellow rookie Sampson as the Browns seek a backfield leader.",

      "text": "Browns' Quinshon Judkins won't be charged, per Broward State Attorney's Office\n- Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins will not face misdemeanor battery charges.\n- The Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office cited lack of video evidence, independent witnesses, and a delayed report as reasons for not pursuing the case.\n- The NFL is reviewing the matter and Judkins remains unsigned and unable to participate in training camp.\nQuinshon Judkins remains the last unsigned player from the 2025 NFL Draft class, but that may not be the case for much longer.\nOn Thursday, the Broward County State Attorney's Office announced they have declined to move forward with a misdemeanor battery charge in the case against the Cleveland Browns' rookie running back.\nJudkins was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on July 12 where he faced a single charge under Florida statute 784.03, relating to \"touch or strike/battery/domestic violence.\"\nBarbara M. Driscoll, Assistant State Attorney Domestic Violence Unit, outlined the reasons the prosecution decided against moving forward with the case:\n- \"This incident was not captured on any video surveillance.\"\n- \"There are no independent witnesses to the incident.\"\n- \"Although the victim had photos showing injuries sustained, there were also videos in that same time frame where no injuries were observed to the victim.\"\n- \"Additionally, the victim's injuries depicted in the photos could be explained by either account of the incident.\"\n- \"Finally, there was a delayed report of the incident. The delay is problematic as the victim was alone on numerous occasions without the Defendant, had the ability and resources to make the report without his knowledge, but chose not to do so.\"\nDriscoll said there is \"no reasonable likelihood of conviction\" and that \"the case is being declined.\"\nThe NFL stated to the Akron Beacon Journal (part of the USA TODAY Network), \u201cWe have been following developments in the matter which remains under review.\u201d\nThe Browns drafted the former Ohio State and Ole Miss running back with the 36th pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Judkins cannot participate in training camp until his contract is signed."
