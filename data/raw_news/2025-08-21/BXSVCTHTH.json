  "title": "YouTube Has Started Giving This Premium Feature Away for Free",
  "description": "YouTube is testing out the ability for free users to download videos without Premium. It leaves out a major Premium perk, though.",
  "content": "YouTube Premium is supposed to be the \"ideal\" YouTube experience. While the service is perfectly usable for free, Premium users get the extra perks, like no ads, complimentary YouTube Music, and an ever-growing list of features. So that's why it's interesting to see YouTube experimenting with offering a Premium-exclusive feature for free\u2014at least, a watered-down version of it.\n\nAs highlighted by Techradar, some YouTube users are seeing the ability to download videos in the app, without having paid for Premium first. This has long been a Premium perk, and for good reason: Offline playback is a great feature for anyone traveling somewhere without an active internet connection, such as when flying or on a train with spotty service, or when keeping an eye on your data usage. As such, it's a strong incentive to subscribe to Premium for anyone who really needs to be able to watch videos whenever they want.\n\nTechradar highlights this Reddit post, where the poster shows off the download capability in their YouTube app for iOS. All users have the \"Download\" button when viewing a video, but typically, free users will only see a prompt to upgrade to Premium if they tap it. This user, however, found that after accidentally tapping the \"Download\" button, they were prompted to download the video itself.\n\nFrom the provided screenshot, you can see the app gives them the option to download the video in \"Medium (360p)\" quality, or \"Low (144p)\" quality. I'd hardly call 360p \"Medium,\" and 144p is what the kids once called \"potato quality,\" so these are not ideal resolutions whatsoever. That's where YouTube is giving an inch, while taking a mile: Just below these options, you'll see the choices to download the video in \"Full HD (1080p)\" or \"High (720p),\" just below a banner for YouTube Premium. YouTube conveniently reminds you that, \"For high-quality unlimited downloads, ad-free and background play, get YouTube Premium.\"\n\nIn addition to these quality restrictions, you won't be able to download music videos for free. This is likely due to royalty issues to artists, since YouTube would be giving people a way to listen to music without the ad or Premium revenue. If you want to save music videos on your iPhone, you'll need to pay up.\n\nI don't have the feature on my end just yet, so it's not clear how widespread this experiment may be. That being said, there are ways to download YouTube videos however you want, without YouTube Premium\u2014so long as you're okay skirting the rules a bit.",

      "text": "Being a tech journalist involves having to sign up for a lot of different apps and digital services to keep tabs on them. I sometimes wonder, if I switched jobs, which subscriptions would I hang onto? One thing I'm clear on: YouTube Premium would be the last one I'd ditch.\nIt's certainly not the cheapest subscription out there: Students pay $7.99 a month, individuals pay $13.99 a month, and families of up to five people can pay $22.99 a month for everything that YouTube Premium offers. That's a substantial amount, but for me it's more than worth it.\nNo ads\nI get why it seems like a waste of money to pay for YouTube when you can also use it for free, with ads, but those ads make a huge difference. The more you use YouTube, the bigger the difference it makes.\nI now find watching YouTube when I'm signed out, or when someone else is showing me something, a painful experience. How can you bear it? Always having your video playlists interrupted, and always having to click or tap to skip ads. And that's not to mention the ads that appear in the sidebar.\nWith Premium, you can queue up playlists and go down YouTube rabbit holes without being interrupted, and if you're watching a lot of videos, the time you're saving quickly adds up. You could use all that extra time to ... watch more videos.\nWe all have different tolerance levels when it comes to ads\u2014it seems that plenty of people are happy to pay less for Netflix in return for seeing some ads\u2014but for me, it's well worth paying to get rid of them, permanently.\nVideo downloads\nIf getting rid of the ads doesn't tempt you, perhaps being able to download videos will. Downloading videos means you can still use YouTube offline, so whether you're about to get on an airplane, or you're heading to a remote cabin, you can still catch up on your favorite channels.\nThis works on mobile and on the web, though it's worth bearing in mind that the videos are locked inside your YouTube app or your web browser: You can't download YouTube videos to MP4 files ready to give to someone else, for obvious reasons.\nIf you're not sure what you want to watch, YouTube can even download videos automatically for you, if you want it to. These downloads will be based on your recommendations and your subscriptions, so you'll never be caught without something to watch offline.\nYouTube Music Premium\nY YouTube Premium comes with YouTube Music Premium included. Cancel your Spotify subscription\u2014currently $10.99 a month for individuals\u2014and you've pretty much paid for YouTube Premium already.\nYouTube Music Premium doesn't quite have the feature set or the polish of Spotify or Apple Music, but it's pretty close, and all the key functionality is covered. There are downloads, there are radio stations, there are podcasts, there's a yearly recap, and much more.\nWith YouTube Music Premium, you have access to all of YouTube\u2014an almost endless selection of live performances, remixes, and rarities. Yes, the original cassette recording of the Mitch Easter version of R.E.M.'s first single is on there, for those who were wondering (sorry if you have to sit through an ad to listen to it).\nThere are other benefits, as well, including being able to carry on watching YouTube videos on your phone while you use other apps. Currently, you can try YouTube Premium free for one month."

      "text": "When you have a reliable internet connection, you don't think about how you watch YouTube on your iPhone. It just works. But there are plenty of times when you either need to go offline, or give your data plan a break. For these situations, it's pretty easy to download YouTube videos on your iPhone to watch them offline or without using data\u2014but not all the methods are exactly equal.\nIs downloading YouTube videos legal?\nThis one\u2019s a bit complicated. If you download videos to your iPhone using YouTube\u2019s service (more on that below), it\u2019s 100% on the up-and-up. However, the platform does not approve of downloading videos from its servers outside of that capacity. It\u2019s actually against YouTube\u2019s terms of service for app developers to make YouTube downloaders and put them on app stores.\nThat said, the company won\u2019t do a thing about it if you do download videos from third-party solutions. Where it will take action is if you upload those videos, especially copyrighted videos, back online. So, play it safe: Download these videos only for your own personal use.\nHow to download videos using YouTube Premium\nYouTube\u2019s preferred method for downloading videos on your iPhone is, of course, by paying for the service. With YouTube Premium, you\u2019ll find a convenient \u201cDownload\u201d button next to most videos on the platform, so you can quickly save your favorite videos for offline viewing anytime. Sometimes, the button is tucked away, but if you swipe on the row of options below the channel's name, you'll find it.\nThe first time you tap \"Download,\" YouTube will offer you quality options for your download: Low (144p), Medium (360p), High (720p), or Full HD (1080p). If you choose \"Remember my settings,\" YouTube won't ask you next time, and will default to whichever quality setting you choose here. Unless storage isn't a concern, I'd suggest letting YouTube ask you each time, since you'll see the total download size of each quality choice with this menu.\nYou'll find your videos under your profile tab on the bottom right, in the Downloads section. You can watch your videos from here, as well as delete any you no longer want saved to your iPhone. Your downloads will stay put so long as your iPhone connects to the internet at least once every 30 days. That's a bit annoying, but unless you're backpacking off the grid for over a month, you should be alright.\nThere are other perks to YouTube Premium, including avoiding ads before videos and the high-quality \u201c1080p Premium\u201d bitrate, for $13.99 per month. It\u2019s an expensive way to download your YouTube videos, but it is the way YouTube approves of.\nUse a YouTube downloader site (but be cautious)\nMobile browsing on iPhone has come a long way. In many respects, it\u2019s just as capable as browsing on a Mac or PC. For example, you can actually use a YouTube downloader in Safari and download a YouTube video just as you would on desktop.\nThis type of downloader is far from a perfect option, however. The YouTube downloaders online can be spammy, blasting you with sketchy ads and giving off an overall malicious vibe. Still, they do work, so it\u2019s a notable option.\nAbout Shortcuts\nIn the past, my go-to has typically been Apple's Shortcuts, a treasure trove of powerful programs\u2014some of which happened to be YouTube downloaders.\nThe problem is, these shortcuts tend to break fast. It's not clear exactly why, but it's possible YouTube frequently changes things on its end and stops these shortcuts from working. That wouldn't be so bad if developers stuck around and patched the issues are they pop up, but, unfortunately, these shortcuts are often abandoned. So, when something goes wrong, the shortcut is useless.\nPrevious versions of this article recommended JAYD (Just Another YouTube Downloader), as well as Sur. Unfortunately, both seem to have met the same fate as other YouTube downloaders, so I can't recommend them anymore. Most other YouTube downloader shortcuts I can find are also old and abandoned.\nAt this point in time, you really have two options for downloading YouTube videos on your iPhone: paying YouTube for the privilege, or using a free downloader site."

The service costs $13.99/month for individuals, $7.99 for students, and $22.99 for families, and includes YouTube Music Premium. Users can download videos via the app\u2019s button, choosing from 144p to 1080p, but must reconnect to the internet every 30 days to keep them. Alternatives include third\u2011party downloaders and shortcuts, though these often break or are unreliable. Overall, Premium\u2019s value lies in uninterrupted viewing and the convenience of offline access, especially for frequent travelers or data\u2011constrained users.",
