  "title": "Motorola Razr Plus 2025 plummets to a new record-low price",
  "description": "This is the best deal we've seen on foldable flip phones lately. Get the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 for a mere $626.18!",
  "content": "Are you looking to get into the world of foldable phones but don\u2019t want to pay the crazy prices they usually come associated with? Have we got the deal for you! Today, I came across this offer and was immediately surprised. The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 has dropped to a new record-low price of $626.18, saving you a whole $373.81 on the retail price. You must like Hot Pink, though! Buy the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 in Hot Pink for just $626.18 ($373.81 off)\n\nMotorola Razr Plus 2025 (Hot Pink) The mid-tier model in the 2025 Razr series, the Motorola Razr+ comes with a 6.9-inch folding display, the same processor as the 2024 Plus model, and better battery performance with moto ai baked in. A 50MP camera, 12GB of RAM, and plenty of storage mean no compromises versus non-flip phones.\n\nMotorola launched three Razr 2025 models this year: the Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and Razr Ultra 2025. The regular Razr is more of a budget device, while the Ultra is a premium handset that competes against the best phones out there. This means the Razr Plus finds itself right in the middle, but it is closer to a premium handset. You\u2019re actually getting quite a premium experience with this phone.\n\nIt comes with an outstanding display that measures 6.9 inches and features a gorgeous Foldable LTPO AMOLED panel with a Full HD+ resolution. What\u2019s even more surprising is that it has a 165Hz refresh rate that will leave most current devices in the dust, even expensive, premium flagships. The 4.0-inch external display is just as lovely, and it will be a great way to interact with the phone without unfolding it all the time.\n\nThe design is also exceptional. It comes with a sturdy aluminum frame, but what I like the most is the back, which is made of vegan leather. This gives it a unique look and a soft texture unlike any other phone. It also comes in some really fun colors, such as this Hot Pink one. It is pretty resistant, too, offering an IP48 rating for both water and dust resistance.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it would be the smaller 4,000mAh battery, but this is actually pretty standard in foldable phones. You just can\u2019t fit a large battery in such a small body. The good news is that it charges pretty fast, at 45W wired or 15W wirelessly.\n\nIf you like the Hot Pink color and want a good foldable flip phone, this is your chance to get it at an amazing price. It\u2019s actually cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, and that one isn\u2019t as good! Go catch this deal while it\u2019s hot!\n\nExtra deal: The Motorola Razr Ultra is also on sale!\n\nMotorola Razr Ultra Adding Ultra to the name, the Motorola Razr Ultra is the first folding phone from Moto with a top-tier processor. The 7-inch folding display is paired with a half-size front display to give you both a premium experience, and a compact and portable communication device.\n\nIf you really want the best of the best, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 isn\u2019t just Motorola\u2019s best foldable; many of us would argue it is the best flip phone, period. It is currently $200 off, bringing the price down to $1,099.99. It\u2019s not exactly cheap, either way, but it is a very capable phone that competes against the biggest contenders in the industry.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nWaterproof tech: Everything you need to know about IP and ATM ratings\nMarch 7, 2025\nWaterproof tech has become a big trend in recent years. But how do you know how protected your device is? Most devices use either an IP or ATM ratings. Let\u2019s start by talking about what an IP rating is. Most high-end smartphones these days have an IP68 rating. These include the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Apple iPhone 16 series, and Google Pixel 9 series. Some can even go up to IP69, but that is rare. What does all of this even mean, though? Let\u2019s dig into it.\nWhat is an IP rating?\nYou probably know that IP ratings have something to do with protection from water and dust, but if you are reading this, that may be as far as your understanding goes.\nAn IP rating tells you the level of protection a device offers against solids and liquids. The International Electrotechnical Commission sets these standards. The \u201cIP\u201d stands for Ingress Protection (or International Protection) and is followed by two numbers. The first number indicates the level of protection against solid particles (dust, dirt, etc.) and ranges from one to six. The second number tells you how much water a device can handle without suffering damage, and it goes from one to nine \u2014 the higher the number, the better the protection against liquids. Check out the chart below for detailed info on what each number means:\n| Level | Solids (first number) | Liquids (second number) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Level 1 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 50mm (example: hands). | Liquids (second number) Protected against vertically falling drops of water. |\n| Level 2 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 12mm (example: fingers). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 15 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 3 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 2.5mm (example: tools and wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 60 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 4 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 1mm (example: small wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against water sprayed from all directions. |\n| Level 5 | Solids (first number) Dust protected \u2014 limited ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 6 | Solids (first number) Dust-tight \u2014 no ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against powerful jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 7 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of immersion in water \u2014 between 15 cm (5.9 inches) and 1 meter (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 8 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water under pressure. Usually 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of immersion for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 9 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against high pressure and temperature water jets. The device needs to survive 30 seconds of 14-16 liters directed at the phone from multiple angles, at an 80-degree Celsius temperature. |\nAs you can tell by the chart above, a handset with an IP67 rating is entirely dust-tight and will survive in up to one meter of water (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. An IP68-rated device is also completely dust-tight. It is protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water, which usually means it will survive in up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of water for 30 minutes. If a phone is IP69 rated, it means it can also handle really hot water under high pressure.\nIP69 ratings are still a bit rare in smartphones, but the list is growing. Some popular phones with an IP69 rating include the OnePlus 13, HONOR Magic 7 Pro, OPPO Find N5, and the Moto G Power 2025.\nYou\u2019ve probably also heard of an IP69K rating. This one isn\u2019t relevant to smartphones. IP69K ratings are provided to equipment made for road vehicles. It ensures that the rated product can withstand severe washes using pressure washers.\nWater-resistant, but not waterproof\nEven if a smartphone has a high IP rating, it may not be completely waterproof. You can drop a phone with an IP68 rating in a freshwater pond, or a tub, and it should be fine. However, if that phone is dipped in a chlorinated pool, or in the ocean, which has saltwater, that could cause problems.\nManufacturers are always quick to tell you water resistance is not a permanent state. The rubber seals and gaskets that usually protect a high IP-rated phone from water damage could be weakened over time. This could decrease the device\u2019s overall water resistance over time. Those same seals can erode if a smartphone encounters coffee, soft drinks, or champagne spills.\nRemember that a phone\u2019s IP rating is based on closed lab conditions, not real-world situations. In other words, try to keep your phone dry, even if it might have a high IP rating.\nAdditionally, a phone that has been damaged is likely no longer waterproof. Water can leak into the device through cracks.\nATM Rating\nThere\u2019s another rating to consider for devices, especially for smartwatches; the ATM (Atmospheres) rating system indicates how much static atmospheric pressure a device can deal with while in water. It\u2019s actually an older rating system than the IP certification. A rating of 1 ATM means that you are at sea level, outside of water. If a device has a 1 ATM level listed, don\u2019t put it in water under any circumstances.\nThe system is actually much simpler to understand. Each ATM number represents about 10 meters of depth. So, if you have a device with an ATM 3 rating, you should be able to submerge it as deep as 30 meters. An ATM 10 rating increases the depth to 100 meters, and so on. These are usually used in smartwatches and other more specialized tech.\nHere\u2019s a look at the ATM rating system.\n| Rating | Pressure | Device Meaning |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rating 1 ATM | Pressure 0. | Device Meaning Do not put in water. |\n| Rating 3 ATM | Pressure Under 100 feet. | Device Meaning Device can be used in the rain, and protected against splashes. |\n| Rating 5 ATM | Pressure Under 165 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for short amounts of time submerged in water, like swimming in a pool. |\n| Rating 10 ATM | Pressure Under 330 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for much longer amounts of time submerged in water, such as for snorkeling in the ocean. |\n| Rating 20 ATM | Pressure Under 660 feet. | Device Meaning Device can handle being used for high impact water sports like surfing and jet skiing. |\nMilitary ready standards\nYou may be wondering if there are any tougher handsets out there. Military certifications guarantee \u201ccombat-ready\u201d smartphones that can handle all kinds of damage. MIL-STD-810G-certified smartphones go through a series of 29 tests. These include exposure to shock, vibration, heat, cold, gunfire shock, humidity, and more. You can learn more about these in the link below. There\u2019s also the improved MIL-STD-810H now, which goes through 30 tests.\nThese MIL-STD ratings are usually reserved for rugged devices. Here\u2019s our list of the best rugged phones, if you want to take a look at some options.\nLooking after your devices\nAn IP or ATM rating gives you peace of mind if you pick up your device with wet hands, accidentally drop it in the pool, or use it in the rain. Without it, there is no reassurance a device will survive some liquid exposure.\nHowever, that does not mean your smartphone is invincible. Here are some quick tips to ensure you will get the most out of your smartphone:\n- If you decide to take your phone in the water, make sure to cover all the ports. Those may include SIM and microSD card slots. Your USB power port may also have a cover.\n- If you take your phone into a chlorinated pool, wash it off with fresh water when you take it out. Don\u2019t use soap or chemicals.\n- Your phone should stay away from saltwater, like the water found in the ocean.\n- Avoid using your phone in extreme locations, including places with high heat, like a sauna, or rough environments.\n- If your phone goes into the water, dry it off thoroughly before plugging other accessories into their ports. That includes your USB phone charger or wired headphones if the phone has a headphone jack. Also, don\u2019t use a hairdryer to dry off your phone; use a dry cloth.\n- Remove any hair or other small objects that you might see inside your phone\u2019s covers and ports. Even small amounts of dirt could damage your microSD card slot, USB power ports, or headphone jack.\n- One last recommendation we can give you is to always have smartphone insurance. You never know when something can go wrong. Also, read your insurance\u2019s terms, as some might not cover water damage, especially when caused by willful actions.\nConsider getting a waterproof pouch\nIf you must take your phone underwater, we recommend investing in a second layer of protection. Waterproof pouches are a great way to keep your expensive electronics safe when submerged in liquids. Here\u2019s a really good one from CaliCase.\nFAQs\nIP ratings are standards that measure how much a product can withstand solids and liquids. It stands for Ingress Protection, and two numbers follow it. The first measures how much the unit can handle solids, while the second number measures liquid resistance.\nThe best smartphones usually come with an IP68 rating. This makes them dust-tight and protected against immersion up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. Some rugged devices take it a step further and also get IP69 certification, which means they can withstand pressured hot water.\nSmartphones don\u2019t usually come with ATM ratings. These ratings are reserved for watches and other products you might take to deeper depths.\nThe most resistant rugged devices come with a MIL-STD rating. Usually MIL-STD-810H, but some devices still have the older MIL-STD-810G rating. These devices go through a wide variety of tests, and can generally handle more damage, such as shock, high pressures, extreme temperatures, and more.\nSome phones don\u2019t have excellent IP ratings. This means it might be unsafe to get them in contact with water. That said, you can always get a waterproof phone pouch and add a layer of protection to any device.\nSay the worst has already happened, and you\u2019ve already water-damaged your smartphone. We have a guide for fixing water-damaged phones. Just keep in mind none of these methods are guaranteed to work. You might need a new phone.

Here are our 5 top recommendations\nFebruary 25, 2025\nWhile the concept of foldable phones has been around for a while, consumers didn\u2019t get hands-on with one until 2018. Samsung was among the first to enter the scene, quickly becoming the biggest player and the only major option in the US. Thankfully, that has changed recently, with Google, Motorola, and even OnePlus helping push foldables to new heights. If you\u2019re looking for a foldable phone today, you have more options than ever. So in this article, let\u2019s examine the best foldable phones on the market and whether or not they would be a great fit for you.\nThe best foldable phones: At a glance\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: A major upgrade to the original Pixel Fold, bringing it up to compete with Samsung\u2019s more established Fold.\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: The most established tablet-phone hybrid, with several features designed to take full advantage of its unique form factor.\n- OnePlus Open: OnePlus\u2019 first foldable, offering a unique Canvas UI and top-notch imaging specs, though priced slightly higher than its reputation might suggest.\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Not all foldables are designed to turn into tablets. Looking for a flip phone experience? Samsung delivers the gold standard here, adding a bigger flex window than ever before.\n- Motorola Razr 2024: The Razr 2024 has further refined its flip phone design both on the inside and out, which includes greatly improved software and cameras as well.\nNot sure what you\u2019re looking for in a foldable or if they are even a good fit? We have a guide on how to find the right foldable phones at the bottom of this page (hit the jump link to go there now).\nNow that you know what you\u2019re looking for, let\u2019s dive a bit deeper into each model and who they are for.\nEditor\u2019s note: We will update this foldable phone list as more devices hit the market.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n- Release date: September 4, 2023\n- When can you expect a successor? Fall of 2025\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold shares much in common with the Pixel Fold but brings a much-needed extra coat of polish. The result is a device that is incredibly thin for a foldable, despite offering a larger 8-inch display than its competition. It\u2019s powered by the same Google Tensor G4 found in the Pixel 9 series and backed by 16GB of RAM, with storage options up to 512GB. While the battery is about 171mAh smaller than the Pixel Fold\u2019s, the battery life on the Pixel 9 Pro is similar and should easily last a full day\u2019s use.\nWhile the specs are impressive, the real magic lies in the foldable experience. Thankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold steps it up here.\nNot only does the new design fold flat, but you can hardly see the crease compared to the previous model. Even better news: the Pixel 9 Pro ditches the Pixel Fold\u2019s odd aspect ratio, adopting a design that\u2019s more like a traditional smartphone display rather than the passport-style seen previously. The new 8-inch display isn\u2019t just bigger\u2014its new aspect ratio means it no longer defaults to landscape mode. The older display would add black bars around many apps due to its unique aspect ratio, one of the device\u2019s biggest downsides.\nPixel Fold specs:\n- Display: 8-inch 2,076 x 2,152 and 6.3-inch 2,424 x 1,080\n- SoC: Tensor G4\n- RAM: 16GB\n- Storage: 256/512GB\n- Cameras: 48, 10.5, 10.8MP\n- Front camera: 10MP external, 10MP internal\n- Battery: 4,650mAh typical, 4,727 minimum\n- Software: Android 13\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- Release date: July 24, 2024\n- When can you expect a successor? Summer of 2025\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the latest and greatest foldable device from Samsung, bringing a host of improvements over its successor including a slightly larger footprint, a more traditional-looking cover screen, a better hinge, and more durability and polish than ever before. It\u2019s also a bit lighter too!\nThe main display is quite big when unfolded at 7.6 inches, while the smaller one comes in at 6.3 inches, which is just a hair bigger than last year. You also get an IPX8 rating, something you won\u2019t find on all the devices on this list.\nIf you want power and performance, the Fold 6 delivers thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor.\nReally what truly makes the Fold 6 stick out is that Samsung has been building foldable phones for years, meaning it\u2019s had plenty of time to refine its hardware and software. One UI lets you run three apps at a time, keep different home screens for the external and internal displays, and so much more. There are also a growing number of great AI features on board too.\nGalaxy Z Fold 6 specs\n- Foldable Display: 7.6-inch,AMOLED 2x\n- Cover screen: 6.3-inch AMOLED 2x\n- Chipset: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\n- RAM: 12GB\n- Storage: 256GB/512GB/1TB\n- Cameras: 3x rear cameras (50MP/12MP/10MP)\n- Front camera: 10MP, 4MP\n- Battery: 4,440mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nOnePlus Open\n- Release date: October 26, 2023\n- When can you expect a successor? Early 2025\nDo you feel like the foldables above are a bit too expensive? The OnePlus Open isn\u2019t exactly cheap, but it is slightly less expensive at $1,699.99. It is no slouch, either. In our OnePlus Open review, we found that this device is quite capable, and we had very little to complain about. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and 16GB of RAM offer great performance, as you\u2019d expect. Battery life is also among the best we\u2019ve seen in a larger foldable; we would usually average close to a day and a half. The 67W SuperVOOC charging is also super fast, and surprisingly, for OnePlus, these cameras are actually quite outstanding.\nUnfortunately, the Open might be the least durable option on this list, as the IPX4 rating is pretty disappointing. It\u2019s also the only option that doesn\u2019t offer wireless charging. Its software also doesn\u2019t have the level of polish that you\u2019d find with Samsung. You can\u2019t specify a different homescreen experience of the internal and external display and there\u2019s a bit more general glitchness when even compared to the Pixel Fold. On the bright side, some of its features like its unique Canvas feature that lets you run three apps but minimize them off to the side, help it stand out from its competitors.\nThe OnePlus One is a great first attempt and is probably one of the few OnePlus products I\u2019d recommend, but just be aware it may take it a few years to truly reach the same level las some of its competitors in this space.\nOpen specs:\n- Interior Display: 7.82-inch LTPO3 Flexi-fluid AMOLED with 120Hz\n- External Display: 6.31-inch LTPO3 Super Fluid OLED with 120Hz\n- SoC: Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n- RAM: 16GB\n- Storage: 512GB\n- Cameras: 64, 48, and 48MP\n- Front camera: 20MP, 32MP\n- Battery: 4,805mAh\n- Software: Android 13\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\n- Release date: July 24, 2024\n- When can you expect a successor? Likely in the summer of 2025\nSo far, all the options on this list have been full-sized phones that turn into tablets, but what about foldable flip phones? That\u2019s where the Flip series comes in. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 isn\u2019t nearly as big of an update aesthetically as the Fold 6 but it does see quite a few major improvements under the hood. The camera gets a major update, ditching its 12MP shooter for a new 50MP main camera that\u2019s in line with the Galaxy S24\u2019s main shooter. The 12MP ultrawide lens remains the same, however. Beyond the camera, there\u2019s also plenty of new AI features and an upgrade to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.\nThe Flip 6 should also handle heat better than ever before, thanks to the addition of a vapor chamber cooling system for the first time on the Z Flip series. The RAM has also jumped up from 8GB to 12GB, which should let it handle modern gaming and other high-performance activities without skipping a beat.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the most affordable folding option from Samsung in 2024, so it might just be the springboard the company needs to reach the masses. It is also made beautifully and offers a great experience.\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 specs\n- Internal Display: 6.7-inch,AMOLED 2x\n- Cover screen: 3.4-inch AMOLED 2x\n- Chipset: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\n- RAM: 12GB\n- Storage: 256GB/512GB\n- Cameras: 2x rear cameras (50MP/12MP)\n- Front camera: 12MP\n- Battery: 4,000mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nMotorola Razr (2024)\n- Release date: July 24, 2024\n- When can you expect a successor? Summer 2025\nMotorola has been in the foldable game for a few years, but it\u2019s really upped its game recently. While the Plus shined brighter than the cheaper Razr last year, things have flipped a bit. The Mediatek Dimensity 7300X does a great job in almost every task you through at it, which makes it a great option considering it starts at just $700. Now if you want the absolute best performance the Plus is still a solid choice, just that the gap between the two models has shrunk considerably this year.\nOverall the Motorola Razr family continues to impress though it\u2019s not all perfect. The Razr Plus has less than average battery life and lacks ultrawide, while the Razr has limited zoom capabilities. Software support also remains a weakness compared to Samsung and Google\u2019s 7-year update and security fix pledge though it does at least offer 3 full yeas of OS updates and 4 years of bi-monthly security patches.\nExpanded cover displays\nSmooth, ad-free software\nRazr (2024) specs:\n- Display: 6.9-inch and 3.6-inch\n- Internal display: 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED\n- External display: 3.6-inch AMOLED\n- SoC: MediaTek Dimensity 7300X\n- RAM: 8GB\n- Storage: 256GB\n- Camera: 50MP and 13MP\n- Front camera: 32MP\n- Battery: 4,200mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nRazr Plus (2024) specs:\n- Display: 6.9-inch and 4-inch\n- Internal display: 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED\n- External display: 4-inch OLED\n- SoC: Snapdragon 8s Gen 3\n- RAM: 12GB\n- Storage: 256GB\n- Camera: 50MP and 50MP\n- Front camera: 32MP\n- Battery: 4,000mAh\n- Software: Android 14\nHow to find the right foldable for your needs\nIf you\u2019ve landed on this page, chances are you\u2019re seriously considering purchasing a foldable phone. But how do you choose the right one? The first step is to determine whether a foldable phone is actually a good fit for you. Once you\u2019ve established that, you need to consider what you want from your device:\n- Are you drawn to the flip phone style for its cool factor and pocketability?\n- Are you looking for a device that transforms into a larger tablet for enhanced productivity?\n- How important is your budget?\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into these considerations.\nAre foldable phones worth it?\nThey may be all the hype these days, but are foldable phones worth it? Despite their appeal, they tend to be more expensive and less durable than traditional candy bar phones. As someone who has used the Z Flip, Z Flip 3, and Z Flip 4, I\u2019m a fan of foldable displays. However, based on my experience, it\u2019s important to clarify: Foldables aren\u2019t for everyone.\nDo any of these situations sound familiar to you?\n- Your phones inevitably end up with dents, major scratches, or even tiny screen fractures after a few years of use, even with a case.\n- You have young children to whom you often hand your phone for mobile games.\n- You need your phone around 24/7 for work (or addiction?) and spend a lot of time in dusty or sandy environments.\n- People tend to call you clumsy, and you\u2019re generally not great with fragile items.\nIt might seem obvious, but if you identify with the above, buying a foldable could be an expensive mistake. Personally, I fall somewhere in the middle, yet my Z Flip 3 only lasted about two years of daily use before the hinge jammed. I can\u2019t recall dropping it or anything significant, but I have kids, ADHD, and, well, things happen. If you\u2019re considering a foldable, be prepared to take extra care of it. Many lack waterproofing, and none are dustproof yet.\nFoldables need to be treated with care, so they're only suitable for a certain lifestyle.\nSo, how do you take care of a foldable phone? Simple. Leave it in the car when you go to the beach, or put it in a water- and sand-proof pouch. Ensure you don\u2019t drop it, as hitting the hinge wrong could turn your phone into an expensive paperweight, especially if it\u2019s out of warranty. Be cautious about who you hand your phone to, as not everyone will treat it with care. While a good case can help, most don\u2019t fit snugly and are more likely to slip off compared to traditional phones, at least in my experience.\nDurability is the biggest downside to foldables. They are also more expensive, and some users are bothered by the creases in foldable displays, though this is something one quickly adjusts to.\nThis might sound like I\u2019m discouraging you from getting a foldable. Quite the opposite, I love them but it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re getting into investing into a technology that\u2019s only been on the market for a little over five years. If you are certain you\u2019ll take care of a foldable and don\u2019t mind the other downsides mentioned, it can be worth it as long as you have clear expectations going in. Some of the biggest advantages of foldable phones include the ability to transform from a standard phone size to a tablet in the case of tablet hybrids, or they can even fold in half for easy pocketability if we\u2019re talking about foldable flip phones. Foldables also just look infinitely cooler than their more ordinary counterparts.\nWill Apple ever make a foldable and should I wait for it?\nFor now there an Android foldable phone is the only way to go but will there ever be an Apple foldable phone? While the idea of a foldable iPhone has definitely cropped up in more than one rumor over the years, the strongest claims suggest a foldable iPhone will happen first. Likely sometime in 2025 or even 2026. If you currently are an iPhone user you have no choice but to wait it out or jump ship to Android.\nFoldable or Flippable? That is the question\nOkay, technology a folding flip phone is still a foldable device but the point here is that you have two main form factors to pick from:\n- Tablet hybrid: These models are about hte size of a typical phone when folded but transform into a smaller tablet for improved productivity, bigger screen entertainment, and more.\n- Foldable flip phones: These models look more like old school flip phones on the outside, complete with small front displays for glanceable information. Once unfolded, the experience is identical to any other candy bar model.\nI can\u2019t tell you which one works best for you, as it\u2019s mostly a subjective thing. Just be aware flip phones have no major advantages over traditional phones outside of cool factor and pocketability, whereas hybrid tablets clearly have the advantage of screen real estate.\nFAQs\nMost manufacturers make their devices to handle at least 200,000 folds. That would be enough to fold and unfold a handset about 100 times daily for nearly 5.5 years. Of course, your mileage will vary, and you might get a defective handset, but phone makers swear by their technology.\nFoldable devices aren\u2019t cheap. Expect to pay $1,000 for most affordable modern foldables. And this is for flip versions. Fold-out devices will cost significantly more. These are mostly considered high-end handsets, though. At least you\u2019re getting a powerful device for all that cash. The only exception here is the Motorola Razr 2023, which costs only $700.\nNot necessarily! Many of these come with an external display that offers at least some level of functionality. Flip foldables like the Razr 5G have tiny screens in the front, which can be used to glance at notifications, change songs, and more quickly. Fold-out phones have an external display that is more similar to a traditional phone in size. Technically, you could use it without opening the phone at all.\nWhile there are a few options to choose from, we\u2019d recommend getting a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, or a Pixel Fold for most people.\nThe most affordable foldable phone we would still be willing to recommend is the Motorola Razr 2023. It is a good foldable and costs only $700.\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell, but at the moment, foldable are still niche devices. Despite being innovative, they still face many problems that prevent them from going mainstream.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nMotorola's Razr 2025 series is here, including the most expensive Razr yet\nApril 24, 2025\n- Motorola has launched the Motorola Razr 2025 series.\n- The new range includes a top-tier Ultra model, complete with a $1,299 price tag.\n- The standard Razr and Razr Plus phones are nearly identical to last year\u2019s models and cost $699 and $999, respectively.\nThe Motorola Razr series has emerged as one of the best alternatives to the Galaxy Z Flip range. That\u2019s in large part due to these foldable phones enjoying wide availability, a great cover screen experience, and a healthy list of specs. Now, after plenty of rumors and leaks, Motorola has launched the Razr 2025 series. And we\u2019ve got three models this year.\nAll three models have an expansive cover screen with a rear camera island, an IP48 rating, a redesigned hinge, and a less prominent crease. The company also revealed that all three phones will have a pre-installed Perplexity AI app optimized for the cover screen and three free months of Perplexity Pro.\nPlenty of AI features\nMotorola hopped on the AI bandwagon last year with its Moto AI features, and all three phones will offer this suite of capabilities. Some of the notable AI additions include image generation, Catch Me Up (an optional notification summary feature), Remember This, and Next Move. Remember This is similar to Nothing\u2019s Essential Space, although Motorola first announced this feature last year. Meanwhile, Next Move will effectively suggest when specific Moto AI features could come in handy. The manufacturer also offers a nifty Playlist Studio AI feature, which generates music playlists based on user descriptions.\nThe company is also bringing two camera-related features to all models. There\u2019s the Group Photo feature, which is effectively Motorola\u2019s version of Best Take on Pixels. Then there\u2019s Signature Style, which sees the phone automatically tweaking the color and tone of your image as it learns your preferences. It\u2019s unclear how the latter feature works.\nMotorola Razr Ultra 2025\nThe Razr Ultra 2025 earns its moniker thanks to additions like the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, 16GB of RAM, and your choice of 512GB or 1TB of storage. This is all powered by a 4,700mAh battery along with 68W wired charging, 30W wireless charging, and 5W reverse wireless charging.\nOn the display front, the phone has a seven-inch 165Hz OLED folding screen (1,224p, 4,500 nits peak brightness) and a four-inch 165Hz OLED cover screen (3,000 nits peak brightness). The phone also has Gorilla Glass Ceramic protection, which should make for a notable durability boost.\nMotorola claims this is the most advanced flip camera system in the world, which is a curious assertion when it simply consists of a 50MP main camera and a 50MP ultrawide shooter (with macro mode). There\u2019s no telephoto camera here, but the brand says the primary camera is capable of 30x zoom. We don\u2019t have high hopes for good-quality 5x or 10x zoom. By contrast, 2023\u2019s OPPO Find N3 Flip managed to squeeze three rear cameras into its frame, including a 32MP 2x tele lens.\nAn ultrawide lens certainly makes sense on a flip foldable, though. These phones are often marketed for their ability to take hands-free photos and group shots in Flex Mode, so an ultrawide camera is definitely worth having in these situations. Otherwise, the Razr Ultra 2025 also has a 50MP selfie camera on the folding screen.\nMotorola Razr and Razr Plus 2025\nDon\u2019t need all these bells and whistles? Then the Razr and Razr Plus 2025 might be for you. However, a cursory glance at the spec sheet reveals that these phones are almost identical to last year\u2019s Razr and Razr Plus phones. That makes us wonder why you\u2019d even buy these devices in the first place when the older ones will likely be cheaper.\nThe Razr Plus 2025 still uses the same Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB storage as the Razr Plus 2024. It also features the same battery and charging specs as last year\u2019s phone, namely a 4,000mAh battery, 45W wired charging, and 15W wireless top-ups.\nThere don\u2019t appear to be any display-related changes, either. So that means a 6.9-inch 165Hz OLED screen (2,400 nits peak brightness) and a four-inch 165Hz OLED cover screen (2,400 nits peak brightness). The Plus variant also has a 50MP main camera, a 50MP 2x tele lens, and a 32MP selfie snapper.\nMeanwhile, the standard Razr 2025 offers an incremental chip upgrade, switching from the Dimensity 7300X to the Dimensity 7400X. It still retains 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 6.9-inch 120Hz OLED screen (FHD+), and a 3.6-inch cover display. The phone has a slightly larger 4,500mAh battery (up from 4,200mAh) but the same 30W wired and 15W wireless charging speeds.\nThe vanilla model also ships with a 50MP main camera (with OIS) and a 13MP ultrawide camera with macro support. A 32MP camera handles video calls and selfies.\nThese new phones now have an IP48 rating instead of an IPX8 rating seen last year. That\u2019s not really an upgrade in practice, as the IP4X rating means these devices still aren\u2019t actually dust-resistant.\nMotorola Razr 2025 series pricing and availability\nIn the market for a premium foldable phone? Then the Razr Ultra 2025 starts at an eye-watering $1,299 for the 16GB/512GB model, although there\u2019s no word on the 1TB variant\u2019s price just yet. The device will be available in a number of color options, including an Alcantara finish and a fancy woodgrain variant akin to the old Moto X.\nThe Razr Plus 2025 is available in a solitary 12GB/256GB variant for $999, while the standard Razr 2025 costs $699 for the sole 8GB/256GB model. All three Razr 2025 series phones will be available for pre-order in the US from May 7, with open sales kicking off from May 15.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\n$200 off: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE discounted for the first time\n8 hours ago\nSamsung\u2019s new foldable phones are exciting, but most are pretty expensive. The only exception is the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which usually costs $899.99. Today, we\u2019re taking a look at its first actual discount, which will save you $200 on the retail price.\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE for just $699.99 ($200 off)\nThis offer is available from Amazon. The discount applies to both available colors. These include Black and White. We\u2019re specifically referring to the 128GB storage model. The one with 256GB is $200 off, but it is pricier at on sale for $759.99.\nDespite only being released late last month, today we\u2019re taking a look at the first discount on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. Before today, we had only seen offers that included a storage upgrade and/or a free gift card with the purchase, so it\u2019s nice to see an actual discount! The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is already the most affordable foldable phone of the most recent line-up, so think of this as savings on top of savings.\nAlthough this device is priced at $699.99, it is still a very capable phone. Its Exynos 2400 processor can handle pretty much any app, game, or task most people will use. After all, it\u2019s the same processor found on the international models of the Galaxy S24 series. It also features 8GB of RAM, which is nothing impressive these days, but it will handle most people\u2019s multitasking needs very well. Most casual users without specialized needs will notice no difference compared to a high-end, premium model.\nThe camera system won\u2019t be among the best, but it should take very decent photos. You get a 50MP primary camera and a 12MP ultrawide shooter. The battery is on the smaller side at 4,000mAh, but this is a common downside with foldable phones. It can charge at 25W wired or 15W wirelessly. You still get an aluminum frame and an IP48 rating.\nAll things considered, this is a really good phone for just $699.99. It\u2019s an especially nice deal considering it\u2019s such a new phone and Samsung\u2019s only foldable phone on sale. Get it while it\u2019s hot!\nIf you\u2019re still not sure, though, we also have a list of the best foldable phones with plenty of alternatives.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nI test all the best Android phones every year, and these are the ones you should buy in 2025\nJuly 4, 2025\nIt\u2019s a funny thing, this idea of calling something the best. After all, everyone wants to think that their favorite of anything is the best \u2014 the best album, book, or cup of coffee \u2014 but that can\u2019t always be true. And, when you apply the idea of being the best to a category as wide open as Android phones, which can come in different shapes, sizes, and prices, the task becomes even greater.\nHowever, I think I have a pretty good idea of what makes an Android phone great. I test and review dozens of them every year, and I\u2019ve spent time with just about every phone you can get your hands on in the US (and even some that you can only buy elsewhere). And, across my many Android-fueled adventures, I\u2019ve learned to pick the qualities that make a phone worth buying. So, with that in mind, here\u2019s what I think are the best Android phones you can buy in 2025.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: The best Android phone overall\n- Excellent build quality, refined design\n- Stunning display\n- Extensive update policy\n- Sharp, powerful cameras\n- Improved wired charging\n- Clever Gemini features\n- Tensor still runs warm\n- Confusing charging situation\n- Only 128GB base storage\nI remember when Google\u2019s Pixel phones felt like niche picks for the most dedicated Android fans. They paired clean, simple software with brilliant cameras and added a dash of fun Google design to the mix, and I always felt clever spotting one out in the wild. These days, the Pixel 9 Pro XL hangs its hat on many of the same features as its predecessors, but it\u2019s no longer a pick for those in the know \u2014 it\u2019s just the best Android phone that money can buy.\nI\u2019ve spent perhaps more time with the Pixel 9 Pro XL (and its smaller Pixel 9 Pro sibling) than anyone else at Android Authority, and it continues to find new ways to impress. Its updated design with smooth, shiny side rails and a camera bar that\u2019s become more of an island feels a little bit Apple-inspired, but in a way that makes me think the student has become the master. Granted, I\u2019ve always been a fan of Google\u2019s camera bar design, but it now feels polished and premium in a way that can stand with any other phone on the market.\nAnd, since we\u2019re already on the topic of the camera bar, let\u2019s dig into Google\u2019s impressive hardware a little further. The Pixel 9 Pro XL packs a 50MP primary sensor that\u2019s simply excellent, capturing plenty of detail and processing images with a very natural color profile thanks to the Tensor G4 chipset. Google\u2019s ultrawide and 5x optical telephoto sensor help to round out the setup with up to 30x zoom, while tricks like a revamped panorama mode and Add Me helped to earn the phone the title of best Android camera phone, too.\nWith an updated design, improved Tensor G4 chipset, and tons of AI features, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is Google's most complete phone to date.\nUpdates under the hood have helped to keep Google\u2019s top-end flagship at the front of my mind since it launched last fall. Its 16GB of RAM (with 4GB reserved for Gemini) and up to 1TB of storage space feel like clever future-proofing methods that will keep the Pixel 9 Pro XL near the top of the list as Google rolls out new AI-powered features like updates to the Pixel Studio, better support for Pixel Screenshots, and new capabilities for Gemini Live over the course of seven years of updates.\nEven the Pixel 9 Pro XL\u2019s battery and charging setup have taken a step forward, thanks in no small part to the combination of the more efficient Tensor G4 chipset and upgraded 37W wired speeds. I don\u2019t even mind that I needed to pick up Google\u2019s new USB-C Pixel charger, as I\u2019m still achieving close to two days of battery life between charges. And, with a starting price of $1,099 (or $999 for the Pixel 9 Pro), Google\u2019s best Pixel to date is a little more approachable than rivals from Samsung and Apple.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The best ultra-tier Android phone\n- Premium materials\n- Great battery life\n- Solid cameras\n- Top-tier Snapdragon performance\n- Brilliant display\n- Excellent software policy\n- Downgraded S Pen\n- Mostly AI-based upgrades\n- Still no full Qi2 support\n- Can be uncomfortable to hold\n- Very expensive\nAs a Pixel fan, it\u2019s easy for me to hype up the Pixel 9 Pro XL as the best Android phone, but for many Samsung diehards, it\u2019s Galaxy or nothing. And, with the amount of power packed into the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I can see where they\u2019re coming from. If there\u2019s a spec you\u2019re looking for \u2014 solid charging, flexible cameras, ample RAM and storage \u2014 I\u2019d be willing to bet that Samsung\u2019s top-end option checks that box, which is why we\u2019re calling it the best ultra-tier Android phone.\nFrom the minute you take it out of the box, the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels like a tool that\u2019s ready to work. Its massive titanium frame protects panels of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both the front and back, and it continues to house the S Pen that\u2019s boosted productivity users since the days of the Galaxy Note lineup. Yes, Samsung simplified its built-in stylus a bit this year and took away a few features, but it remains the easiest way to take notes and doodle your way into Sketch to Image on the gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED panel.\nTo me, though, the Galaxy 25 Ultra stands out because of its four rear cameras. Like the previous generation, the start of the show is a huge 200MP sensor that covers much of the short-range zoom until the dual 3x and 5x optical telephoto sensors take over to push to 100x Space Zoom with a bit of help from some Galaxy AI processing. I prefer the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s shots up to about the 10x zoom length, as there\u2019s barely any drop in quality, and the built-in camera filters make it easier to put some personality into your images right off the bat.\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra remains a productivity powerhouse with four rear cameras and a built-in S Pen.\nThe rest of Samsung\u2019s internals keep the Galaxy S25 Ultra well-positioned for the future, even if they come at a cost. Yes, this ultra-tier flagship starts at $1,299 \u2014 more than any of our other primary picks \u2014 but that\u2019s what you pay for an \u201cUltra\u201d phone, and for your money, you get an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM across most configurations, frequently updated Galaxy AI features, and the fastest charging that you\u2019ll currently find on a Samsug phone at 45W. But, with seven years of updates, you can stretch your time with the Galaxy S25 Ultra further than most of its rivals.\nGoogle Pixel 9a: The best Android phone under $500\n- Solid, reliable cameras\n- Excellent update commitment\n- Clever AI-powered features\n- Great battery life\n- New, streamlined design\n- Excellent price\n- Relatively slow charging\n- Aging Gorilla Glass 3 (again)\n- Missing Pixel Screenshots\nAlthough I love spending time with the biggest, most expensive flagship Android phones, I think I\u2019m ready to tell you a little secret: They\u2019re not my favorites. Instead, I think the mid-range is the best section of the Android market right now \u2014 the phones that pick up a few flagship-level features without the painful price tag. There\u2019s no better example than the slimmed-down, sped-up Pixel 9a.\nIn almost every way, the Pixel 9a is just the type of addition the larger Pixel 9 series needed. It carries over most of the great AI-powered features I mentioned falling in love with on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, like access to the Pixel Studio, using Gemini to multitask across apps, and receiving the same regular Pixel Drops as its flagship siblings. It\u2019s a bummer to see Pixel Screenshots wind up on the cutting room floor, but I\u2019ve always found screenshot management in Photos good enough that I don\u2019t mind too much.\nI love the Pixel 9a's slimmed-down design and flagship-tier features at the $500 price point.\nPerhaps the one thing that initially surprised me about the Pixel 9a was its updated design. I\u2019d seen leaks and rumors that the camera bar was going away, and I didn\u2019t want to believe it. However, since spending time with Google\u2019s most affordable model, I\u2019ve come around to the benefit of simplicity. Google didn\u2019t just axe its iconic camera bar for fun, but instead found ways to slim the internal components to free up the space to embed its cameras deeper into the body. The result is a phone that doesn\u2019t collect dust around its cameras, but still manages to have the same Google-y personality I love about Pixels.\nAlong with that refreshed design, Google gave its mid-ranger several other updates to make the $500 price tag feel like even more of a bargain. It carries the same Tensor G4 chipset as its flagship siblings, and has swapped to a wider 48MP primary camera that lets in more light for Google\u2019s brilliant image processing to play with, and it\u2019s all topped off with the largest battery on any Pixel at 5,100mAh. I called it the best $500 phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019ll stand by that until the Pixel 10a comes around.\nCMF Phone 2 Pro: The best Android phone under $300\n- Incredibly low price\n- Amazing design and display\n- Cool modular features\n- Primary, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses\n- Good update commitment\n- Not good for a US-based buyer\n- Controversial Essential Key\nMoving down another step, it\u2019s remarkable to see how far the budget Android segment has come in just a few years. I remember bashing cheap options for their lame cameras, underwhelming charging, and bland designs, and now the CMF Phone 2 Pro feels like a breath of fresh air by comparison. It\u2019s the personality-packed follow-up to one of the most interesting phones of 2024, the CMF Phone 1, and it improves on almost every aspect of the modular design without jumping the price too much.\nOf course, I should point out that it still doesn\u2019t work well in the US. Yes, you\u2019ll get some band support, but it won\u2019t completely cover any of the big three networks. That said, if you live in a supported market, or can live with some signal inconsistency, there is absolutely no better phone under $300.\nThe modular design is the most fun I\u2019ve had with a phone since Samsung brought back the flip phone with its Galaxy Z Flip lineup. The design still works the same as it did on the first CMF Phone, having you release the back panel with a series of screws before attaching different accessories like a lanyard, card holder, or a kickstand.\nCMF's Phone 2 Pro builds on a quirky, modular design in a way that's still fun to switch up every day.\nI think the coolest accessory that the team at CMF has cooked up is one that\u2019s out for Moment\u2019s lunch. The Phone 2 Pro supports new external camera lenses, which you can screw on and off the updated 50MP sensors to give them macro and fisheye functionality. It\u2019s perhaps a slightly old-fashioned take on what\u2019s usually done with software or a dedicated sensor, but I like that it means you don\u2019t have to worry about macro mode turning on and off as it senses you nearing a subject. Oh, and have I mentioned that you can give this quirky pick a try for less than $300?\nAt that price, we usually expect some pretty significant cuts to budget phones, but I think the Phone 2 Pro has managed to avoid most of the pitfalls. Its Dimensity 7300 Pro is up for most tasks, and adding the Essential Key allows the budget pick to tap into the same convenient AI journal that Nothing introduced on its recent Phone 3a duo. The upgraded IP54 rating (up from IP52) is also a nice touch, but it falls slightly behind the IP68 protection that Samsung and Motorola have started adding to their affordable options.\nSamsung Galaxy A16 5G: The best Android phone under $200\n- Stellar software update promise\n- Solid primary camera\n- Decent battery life\n- Great price\n- Good charging\n- Just-okay build quality\n- Aging performance\n- Weak peripheral cameras\n- Bland design\nThe last of our budget picks, the Galaxy A16 5G, somehow manages to dance within one of the tightest categories of Android phones. When launching for less than $200, you have to make some serious concessions on the spec sheet, yet this cheap Android option manages to check off quite a few boxes with a decent IP54 rating (matching the CMF Phone 2 Pro above), an AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, and an in-house Exynos 1330 processor in the US. It also looks the part of a more expensive Galaxy device, pulling heavily from Samsung\u2019s streamlined flagship style.\nI spent a fair portion of my winter with the Galaxy A16 5G in my pocket, and I came away impressed more often than not. Yes, I have to put it into the context that this is merely a $200 Android phone, but sometimes good enough is all you need. Its display is bright enough in most conditions, its primary camera is flexible enough to cover day-to-day shooting in decent lighting, and its battery life is pretty solid because of the power-sipping processor. However, one thing truly adds a mountain of value to a phone that costs little more than a mole hill.\nSamsung's Galaxy A16 5G is a fine value pick boosted by an incredible update commitment.\nYes, it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s downright remarkable commitment to software updates. Despite costing about the same as a premium pair of running shoes, the Galaxy A16 5G is on tap for six years of updates across major Android patches and regular security coverage. That puts this budget option at more updates than either the OnePlus 13 or Motorola Razr Ultra can match, despite both flagships costing at least four times more.\nUltimately, that mix of value and long-term support makes the Galaxy A16 5G great for a few particular groups of people, like kids or grandparents. It makes sense for the former as you won\u2019t have to worry too much about the phone picking up scuffs or scrapes since it doesn\u2019t cost too much to repair or replace, while it makes sense for the latter as One UI probably won\u2019t change too much over the course of its many updates, making it easy for you to lend a hand as the go-to tech support person in your family.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro: The best Android camera phone\n- Impressive Gemini-powered features\n- Excellent build quality\n- Gorgeous display\n- Flexible, capable cameras\n- Reliable update commitment\n- Tensor G4 still runs hot\n- Charges slower than 9 Pro XL\n- Limited base storage\nA lazier guide would tell you to scroll back up to the Pixel 9 Pro XL \u2014 our pick for the best overall Android phone \u2014 skim that entry, and then come back here to understand why the Pixel 9 Pro also makes this list, as both phones share the same camera specs and smarts. But I\u2019d much rather take this chance to hype up one of the best pocket-sized phones you can still get your hands on. After all, this is the one phone that\u2019s made its way back into my pocket more than any other whenever I find myself between reviews, and if you don\u2019t care about having a larger screen for snaps, the Pixel 9 Pro gets you that same industry-leading camera package for under $1,000, so it\u2019ll save you some cash, too.\nGoogle\u2019s 6.3-inch flagship packs the same hardware \u2014 50MP primary, 48MP periscope telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide sensors \u2014 as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the smaller body makes it much easier to pull out of your pocket and grab a photo before you miss the moment. On top of that, the Pixel 9 Pro still supports all of the same AI-powered shooting modes like Add Me, the refreshed Panorama mode, and the ability to edit your shots after the fact with Magic Editor.\nWant to see the proof for yourself? You can check out a whole bunch of our camera test samples in this Google Drive.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro takes everything we loved about the XL and, well, shrinks it.\nOf course, to make its compact Pro model run smoothly, Google had to make a cut or two. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t follow the path of Apple\u2019s previous Pros, putting different telephoto sensors on each size, but instead opted for a smaller battery. The Pixel 9 Pro packs a still-solid 4,700mAh battery with 27W wired charging from the same USB-C Pixel charger I\u2019ve mentioned once or twice and 21W wireless charging from the in-house Pixel Stand. Otherwise, though, everything from the combination of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to the top-notch build quality and the still-questionable Temperature Sensor is a perfect match for the full-sized flagship.\nMotorola Razr Ultra: The best flip-style Android foldable\n- Blisteringly fast charging and excellent battery life\n- Ultra-flagship-tier performance\n- Solid dual camera setup\n- Top-notch materials and eye-catching Pantone colors\n- Two very vibrant displays\n- Clean, simple software\n- Moto AI feels half baked\n- Limited software commitment\n- Long-range zoom kinda stinks\n- Expensive\nIt\u2019s tough to pick a flip phone as my favorite overall Android phone, but I think the Motorola Razr Ultra is about as close as any has come. After all, it\u2019s the first of its form factor to truly take the training wheels off, packing its spec sheet with Ultra-grade decisions while carefully dancing within its limits. It takes almost everything I loved about the previous flagship Razr foldable, fixes the odd camera decision I thought I\u2019d like, and then adds an extra dose of power in the form of additional RAM and Qualcomm\u2019s top-tier chipset.\nMore specifically, the Razr Ultra packs an impressive 16GB of RAM in its base configuration with 512GB of storage by default, both of which are more than any of Samsung\u2019s foldables can match. It then pairs them up with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and a 4,700mAh battery that towers over that of most flip phones I\u2019ve reviewed. Not only that, but Motorola\u2019s top-tier flip phone also packs a charging setup worth writing home about. The Razr Ultra ships ready to handle up to 68W wired TurboPower speeds with 30W wireless charging as a backup, at least as long as you have a capable charger. That\u2019s fast enough to run circles around everyone but OnePlus in the US, and makes an already great phone feel even better.\nThe Razr Ultra is by far the best-looking, most powerful flip phone I've ever used.\nPerhaps what wins the Razr Ultra the most points over Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip lineup is that I still prefer its cover screen experience. There are no hoops to jump through, no extra software to install, and no weird layouts to avoid. Yes, your apps use the entire display by default, meaning they might get cut off by the camera cutouts, but you can quickly fix that with a press of the gesture pill to compact the interface into a smaller square. On top of that, AI companions like Perplexity, Gemini, and Moto AI come optimized for the cover screen, making it easy to ask for help when needed.\nWhile I don\u2019t usually like to put too much stock into the way a phone looks \u2014 especially if I\u2019m going to put it into a case \u2014 there\u2019s no way around it on the Razr Ultra. Every colorful finish that Motorola offers comes from its close partnership with Pantone, and the different back panels offer more personality than the usual mix of Gorilla Glass can match. I reviewed the Mountain Trail version, which comes with a wooden back and a bronzed aluminum frame, but Motorola\u2019s Scarab finish is an eye-catcher with its deep green color and slightly fuzzy Alcantara back panel. I might be concerned about how it\u2019ll age in the coming years, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen anyone use materials quite like Motorola.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold: The best tablet-style Android foldable\n- Impressively thin design that opens completely flat\n- Excellent displays with high brightness\n- Thoughtful enhancements to Android for foldables\n- Lots of Gemini-powered AI features\n- Seven years of update support\n- Camera setup weaker than other Pixel 9s\n- Sluggish, frustrating charging\n- Tensor G4 behind the competition for power\n- Buttons too low\n- Extremely high price\nAt long last, there\u2019s a new king of the tablet-style Android foldable phones. Yes, this was Samsung\u2019s spot to lose for a long time \u2014 partly because it was the only real option in the US for several years \u2014 and now it\u2019s happened. After an original Pixel Fold that felt like a bright idea with classic prototype flaws, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels ready to stand on its own two feet, or at least two sides of its hinge. Google took everything we liked about its original form factor, ironed out the quirks, and then completely reimagined its internal display for a more comfortable experience.\nWhat surprised me most about coming to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a little late in the game is that it doesn\u2019t feel too different from the small Pixel 9 Pro, at least not when closed. As a result, I\u2019m much more willing to pull it out of my pocket for casual tasks like streaming, social media, and updating my Strava activities without feeling like I\u2019m trying to type on a knife\u2019s edge. Then, when I\u2019ve found whatever show I\u2019m desperately trying to keep up with, I\u2019m perfectly comfortable opening the nearly bezelless internal display and only losing a bit of space to letterboxing.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels like a much larger upgrade than simply a second-year refresh.\nAlthough it\u2019s a massive leap forward for Google\u2019s foldables overall, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold isn\u2019t without its quirks. Its slim form factor means the Tensor G4 chipset has to work a little harder to vent heat, while the 4,650mAh battery is held back by just 21W wired charging \u2014 barely faster than what you get from the Pixel 9a for a third of the cost. Google\u2019s peripheral cameras feel like odd choices, too, with just a 10.8MP telephoto and 10.5MP ultrawide to hold down the newly square camera bump.\nAnd yet, I still feel like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the best tablet-style foldable you can get your hands on. Maybe it\u2019s because many of the Android Authority crew are Pixel fans by nature, but I feel like Google\u2019s approach to Android remains one of the cleanest and easiest to navigate, with the right mix of optimizations for the internal display. You\u2019ll also get the full suite of AI-powered features like Call Screen, Pixel Studio, and Gemini Live, just with far more real estate on which to explore them.\nOnePlus 13: The best Android phone for battery life\n- Gorgeous design\n- Incredible camera zoom and overall photography\n- Helpful AI integration\n- Excellent charging options\n- Simplified Oxygen OS experience\n- Great performance\n- Magnetic charging requires accessories\n- Fewer updates than Samsung or Google\nThese days, 5,000mAh batteries have almost become the standard on large Android flagships. Everyone is using them, from Google to Samsung to Motorola, and it\u2019s made life hard when hunting for the phone with the best battery life. However, whenever everyone seems to catch up, there\u2019s always one brand ready to jump ahead again. To nobody\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s once again the flagship killer, OnePlus. Its OnePlus 13 is a shoo-in for the best battery life, and it comes down to a no-limits combination of capacity and charging speed. Plus, it also helps that it\u2019s generally one of the best phones OnePlus has ever made.\nUp first, the cell that keeps the lights on. The OnePlus 13\u2019s 6,000mAh cell is large enough to make all but the most dedicated gaming phones feel inadequate. It\u2019s a full 1,000mAh larger than the battery Samsung tapped for its Galaxy S25 Ultra or Google chose for its Pixel 9 Pro XL, yet the OnePlus 13 is no thicker than either one. It can achieve such a remarkable capacity thanks to its switch from lithium-ion technology to silicon-carbon, a move that we\u2019d love to see the likes of Samsung copy the next time it tries an ultra-thin Edge model.\nBetter, our objective drain testing showed that the OnePlus 13 can go on and on thanks to its impressive cooling setup and efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It does experience some pretty extreme throttling here and there, occasionally quitting out benchmarking tests in the name of thermal management, but I\u2019ve always been able to go two days between charges, so I\u2019m not complaining.\nOnePlus's 6,000mAh battery looms large over most other Android flagships.\nAnd, when you inevitably drain your OnePlus 13, SuperVOOC charging is some of the best in the business. You\u2019ll need to keep the included USB-A charger close at hand since SuperVOOC is a much different standard than USB PD PPS in terms of support, but when you watch the OnePlus 13 fly back to a 50% charge in just 13 minutes, you probably won\u2019t have an issue with it. OnePlus\u2019s latest flagship also supports 50W wireless charging through a brand-new magnetic charger with a built-in fan, though you\u2019ll need a magnetic charger and might have to use a special plastic panel to protect the Arctic Dawn finish should you choose that colorway \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a confusing mess, and the only blot on an otherwise near-perfect package.\nASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Best Android phone for gaming\n- Overkill performance\n- Outstanding battery life\n- Fast, universal charging\n- Super-stable video\n- Handy AI tools\n- Expensive Pro model\n- Poor software commitment\n- Inconsistent cameras\n- No 4K recording on all lenses\nThe last of our main selections for this list of the best Android phones is one for the gamers, literally. ASUS\u2019s ROG Phone 9 Pro is about as close to a gaming laptop as you can get, at least if you can ignore that it doesn\u2019t fold in half. It has a frankly ridiculous spec sheet, offering up to 24GB of RAM with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip under the hood and 65W wired charging that\u2019s much faster than the MacBook Air I\u2019m using to assemble this list.\nOf course, those features aren\u2019t completely unheard of in the flagship Android segment \u2014 well, 24GB of RAM is a lot \u2014 but its clever gaming tweaks set the ROG Phone 9 Pro apart. It pulls the programmable matrix from the back of the ROG Zephyrus and pairs it with pressure-sensitive triggers dotted around the frame to help you draw some of the controls off the 6.78-inch AMOLED itself. Those features, combined with the improved efficiency of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, had my colleague Rob Triggs gaming with a smile, pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro as hard as he wanted to find out where its throttling point lay.\nFor what might be the first time, though, Rob also declared this to be a gaming phone he might not mind using every day. See, a lot of gaming-specific devices fall into the common trap of being too big, too edgy, and too expensive for casual usage, not to mention the fact that camera hardware almost always comes last. On the ROG Phone 9 Pro, however, you get an updated 50MP LYTIA 700 sensor for the bulk of your photography, and ASUS has reimagined its stabilization for better video shooting. The display is also brighter and smoother than before, topping out at a 185Hz refresh rate and 2,500 nits of brightness, which is more than enough for a bright, sunny day.\nThe ROG Phone 9 Pro is an elite gaming phone that's flexible enough for everyday usage.\nAlso, if you\u2019re serious about pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro to its gaming limits (and why wouldn\u2019t you be?), ASUS has several accessories worth checking out. Rob got plenty of mileage out of the detachable controller below, though he also mentioned the external cooling setup as a helpful option when trying to game and charge simultaneously. And, if you\u2019re not set on the customizable LED matrix on the back, you can also check out the ROG Phone 9 to save a couple of bucks.\nHonorable mentions\nIf the Xiaomi 15 Ultra were just a little bit easier to access in the US, it might have earned a full spot on our list rather than simply an honorable mention, and I think it still has a legitimate claim to being the best Android camera phone. Like the last few Ultras, it\u2019s practically a mirrorless camera with a phone on the back, pairing a trio of 50MP sensors with a 200MP telephoto camera and sporting an overall design that\u2019s reminiscent of a Leica mirrorless camera to go along with Xiaomi\u2019s Leica-tuned color science.\nMaking its first full appearance on this list (CMF Phone 2 Pro not withstanding), the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is one of the most fun mid-rangers I\u2019ve reviewed in a while. Yes, it suffers from the same limited US band support as its siblings, but it\u2019s easy to fall in love with the dot-based Nothing OS skin, the light-up Glyph Interface, and the snappy 50W wired charging. I might like the more subtle camera bump on the Nothing Phone 3a a little better, but the extra zoom flexibility is a worthy tradeoff.\nOnePlus\u2019s proper 2025 flagship is more than deserving of its place as our battery king, but its mid-range option isn\u2019t far behind. Some might say that the OnePlus 13R is a bit of a 2024 flagship in disguise, and I think they\u2019d be right \u2014 in the best of ways. It pairs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset with a OnePlus 13-esque design, housing a trio of camera sensors in its circular bump. I\u2019ll never complain about a phone with a 6,000mAh battery capacity, though it\u2019s a bit of a bummer that the included SuperVOOC charger will only get you to 55W.\nAlthough I\u2019m happy to call Motorola\u2019s latest Razr Ultra the best flip phone, it\u2019s also the most expensive. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 6, on the other hand, picks up right where the Galaxy Z Flip 5 left off, with two capable cameras, a folder-shaped Flex Window, and nabs a chipset upgrade to keep things interesting. You\u2019ll have to get used to having two app drawers if you want more than Maps, YouTube, and Google Messages at your disposal, but Samsung\u2019s full-screen widgets are simply excellent.\nIn that same vein, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has gone from setting the standard for book-style foldables to playing second fiddle to the Pixel. It\u2019s still an excellent foldable, and its taller, thinner internal display sometimes makes a bit more sense than Google\u2019s wide aspect ratio, but it hasn\u2019t changed too much outside of a chipset upgrade in recent years, still sporting the same battery, charging setup, and cameras as the Folds that came before it.\nIf you\u2019ve spent any time looking for a great Android phone, you\u2019ll know there aren\u2019t many small ones left. Somehow, 6.5-inch or larger displays have become the standard, leaving those of us with smaller hands relegated to a precious few picks. Thankfully, the Pixel 9 is one of those, offering quite a lot of the Pro-level experience in a slightly more comfortable form factor. Its 6.3-inch display is easy to reach across yet doesn\u2019t feel so tiny that you\u2019re missing out on real estate. If we hadn\u2019t already put every other Pixel 9 device on this list, this one might have earned more than an honorable mention.\nMany of Samsung\u2019s best offerings lay it on pretty heavy with the focus on power users, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. However, it also has the unintended benefit of making Samsung\u2019s budget-conscious picks stand out slightly more. The Galaxy S24 FE is one such option, landing just below the flagship tier with a display that nearly matches the Galaxy S25 Plus, materials like aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus that I\u2019d trust without a case, and just enough of a dip into Galaxy AI to give more users a taste of Chat Assist, Note Assist, and better photo editing tools.\nWhat to look for in a good Android phone\nWe could sit here and list the best Android phones all day \u2014 we\u2019re phone nerds, it\u2019s our job. We\u2019ll sit here and reminisce on some of the best phones from yesteryear, too, looking for any excuse to pull something fun out of the closet. However, just because we like one or two or ten things about a phone doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right for you. There\u2019s much more to consider before you splash the cash, especially if you plan to have this phone for several years.\nWe have our favorite Android phones, but the best way for you to pick one is to break it down into the features you really want.\nFor example, if you want a small, super-portable phone, something like the Galaxy S25 Ultra simply won\u2019t work, no matter how you try to wrangle it. That 6.9-inch display will always feel too big for your pocket. At the same time, it\u2019s a great phone that packs flexible cameras, a powerful chipset, and a convenient S Pen, so it\u2019s all about deciding what features you absolutely must have in a device.\nSo, with that in mind, here are a few things I always tell people to look for when buying a new phone:\n- Software updates: A phone is only as good as the number of software updates it will receive. You won\u2019t be able to change your battery, display, or camera hardware over time, so most of the value you\u2019ll pull from a phone comes from keeping it for years and years after you\u2019ve paid it off. The best way to guarantee some of that value is with a Pixel or Galaxy device set for seven years of patches, though Motorola and OnePlus are catching up with four and five years of support at their flagship levels.\n- Camera flexibility: If you\u2019re after one of the best Android phones on the market, you probably have high camera expectations. It\u2019s perfectly understandable \u2014 you\u2019ll probably capture your life with this device for several years. And, as you might have noticed, single-camera Android phones aren\u2019t a thing anymore. So, if you prioritize a great camera phone, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on things like sensor size, telephoto focal length, and how your phone processes images after the fact.\n- Display size: As mentioned above, finding a small Android phone is easier said than done these days. There aren\u2019t many 6.1-inch or 6.2-inch options left, with premium picks like the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S25 Ultra measuring close to 7 inches, and many budget to mid-range options measuring 6.5 inches or larger. Also, if display size is no issue (or you want a phone that can check two boxes at once), you might consider a foldable that can take over for a tablet, too.\n- RAM and storage options: Depending on your needs, you might also want to monitor the RAM and storage that your chosen Android phone comes with. At one point, 8GB of RAM was enough to tackle everything from web browsing to gaming to streaming a full season on Netflix, but no longer. With the explosion of AI-powered features, 12GB is closer to the bare minimum for flagships, while the Pixel 9 Pro series feels even more capable with 16GB across the board.\n- To fold or not to fold: Foldable Android phones remain one of the most exciting categories in tech, at least to me. They\u2019ve improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, picking up better cameras, thinner hinges, and better protection against water and dust. However, you\u2019ll still have to weigh out whether or not you have the budget to try something new and if you can live with a spec sheet that hasn\u2019t caught up just yet.\n- Durability: These days, phones feature more premium materials than ever, sometimes pairing aluminum and titanium frames with advanced glasses like Panda Glass and Gorilla Glass or interesting textures like vegan leather and, in the case of the Razr Ultra, Alcantara. My advice would be to think about what materials you want and whether or not you plan to put your phone in a case. Also, keep in mind that IP68 ratings against water and dust have become the standard for many flagships, so think twice before settling for a lower rating, even if it saves money.\n- Charging speed: It\u2019s no longer a surprise to see phones ship with 5,000mAh batteries \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s expected on phones of a certain size. However, with great power capacity comes great responsibility, so you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on the charging speeds that your new phone supports. Some, like OnePlus, offer up to 80W speeds with the correct charger, while others, like the Galaxy S25, won\u2019t go above 25W no matter how hard you try. Also, if you opt for something like the Pixel 9 Pro XL, you\u2019ll need Google\u2019s in-house USB-C charger to guarantee the best speeds, so you might need to budget for some extra charging accessories.\n- AI features: One last thing worth watching \u2014 and probably the least essential of my picks \u2014 is the list of AI features your new phone will support. If you opt for a flagship Pixel or a Galaxy S25, you\u2019ll get a pretty solid set of Gemini and Galaxy AI picks, while the OnePlus 13 and Motorola Razr lineup might lag behind just a bit. Then again, you might find that the available features don\u2019t quite mesh with your usage or don\u2019t feel quite polished enough, so you may also be able to get by with Circle to Search and some of the other features that have made their way to lower price points.\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019m a phone guy \u2014 always have been. I can still rattle off every device I\u2019ve ever purchased with my own money, and I continue to hold the LG G3 as one of my favorite phones of all time. I stayed almost perfectly true to Android ever since my parents got me my first smartphone after I made it to high school, at least as long as you\u2019re willing to forgive the few years I spent with an iPhone 7 when I let green bubble bullying get the best of me.\nSince then, I\u2019ve made my love of phones into my day job, shifting my personal SIM more times than I can count and spending time with everything from the Motorola Moto G Play (2021) to the OnePlus Open to the Galaxy S25 Ultra in my pocket. I won\u2019t pretend to have loved every phone I\u2019ve reviewed \u2014 you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet \u2014 but I\u2019ve taken highlights away from each one and come to appreciate Android options both high and low.\nI review dozens of Android phones every single year, and my personal SIM moves around enough to qualify for frequent flyer status.\nFurther, my opinions come from more than simply running around with a new phone in my pocket. Part of my role as a reviewer is to work closely with my colleague, and our resident testing expert, Rob Triggs, to come up with objective metrics by which we can compare devices. We\u2019ve worked closely to cook up tests for battery life and charging, along with a nicely standardized set of ways to put CPUs and GPUs through their paces long before I ever sit down to write a review. Do I still count my hands-on experience? Of course I do, but I also like to ensure that data backs them up. If you want more information on our testing procedures, you can read our full methodology at the link.\nWhat do you look for in an Android phone?\nSometimes, my need to be thorough means that I\u2019m not the first reviewer to press the publish button, and I\u2019m rarely the shortest and sweetest among my peers, but I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll happily cause a little bit of a headache for my editor (shout out to you, Ollie) if it means I know I\u2019m being as thorough as possible. Besides, with how far phones have come in just the last few years, I\u2019m not sure how anyone could put together a review without stopping and taking a few stretch breaks.\nThank you for being part of our community.
