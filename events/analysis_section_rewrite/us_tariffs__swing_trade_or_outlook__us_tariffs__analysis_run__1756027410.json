      "feedback": "Overall this draft shows the right four-line structure and a plausible regime/scenario framing, but it falls short on the exact format, explicit probabilities, and tight, first-principles linkage. Key fixes: (1) enforce the required four-line format with exact fields and fill in Probability % for each line; anchor probabilities to the material’s language (e.g., “moderate confidence path” or explicit regime odds) and attach precise IDs after facts; use ranges rather than vague levels where the sources don’t give a single number. (2) Reorder and align lines so two Up lines and two Down lines map to a clean cause–effect chain: Baseline/Escalation as Up or Down with clear catalysts, and Deregulation/Geopolitics as the other pair, ensuring each line states a concrete driver, a watch item, and a numeric focal point. (3) Tighten first-principles grounding: start from the five pillars (tariff regime, real-rate/policy reaction, productivity/supply-chain reconfiguration, cross-border finance, governance) and show how each line’s driver propagates to prices, margins, or capital reallocation, citing Adyen (QRX2HD4X0), Intel‑CHIPS governance (5M9M1KACF), Japan anti-dumping (2SJORBV6H), and the tariff signals (RHFWI02JT; Scraped Source 2) where relevant. (4) Quantification and specificity: replace generic phrases with concrete numbers where available (15% EU tariff; 1.8% near-term lift; 18.6% import burden; Adyen H1-2025 metrics) and attach citations after each numeric claim (e.g., “15% broad EU tariff (RHFWI02JT)”; “1.8% lift, 18.6% tariff burden (Scraped Source 2)”; “Adyen H1 2025 net revenue €1,093.5m, +20% YoY (QRX2HD4X0)”). (5) Outlook/Swing-Trade plan: since the material is macro/regime-focused and not a single tradable asset, present the required Outlook as a single, concise line if you’re not conditioning on a tradable asset; otherwise, convert to a Swing Trade line for a liquid instrument if preferred and specify entry/stop/target and risk metrics with sources. (6) Citations: ensure every factual number has an in-text ID, and avoid piling sources on non-numeric claims; ensure coverage of critical sources (RHFWI02JT; Scraped Source 2/3; QRX2HD4X0; 2SJORBV6H; 5M9M1KACF; 9W8ZUIBDY; WLXM1819K; AJTHKYXQ3; DGG6HXUFZ; VCZKKPORO; etc.) and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., Baseline tariff persistence vs Geopolitics shocks) within the four lines.\n\nSpecific edit instructions you can apply now:\n- Rebuild each of the four lines as: Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % (cite after the line’s facts); e.g. Up | 3–6 months | Baseline regime intact with 15% EU tariff; near-term price lift ~1.8% and 18.6% tariff burden; watch tariff cadence and exemptions | 60–70% (RHFWI02JT; Scraped Source 2)\n- Second Up line: Up | 3–6 months | Deregulation/Policy Reversal lifting investment appetite; CRA activity and Intel CHIPS governance signaling subsidies monetized via equity stakes | Watch policy cadence, CRA activity, and Intel CHIPS governance outcomes | 55–65% (9W8ZUIBDY; Scraped Source 5; 5M9M1KACF)\n- Down line 1: Down | 0–3 weeks | Near-term enforcement tightening: India tariffs Aug 27; de minimis expiry Aug 28; EU 15% MFN from Sept 1; 50-day furniture tariff window | Watch DOJ/court timing, EU legislative cadence, de minimis outcome, furniture tariff window progression | 40–50% (DGG6HXUFZ; VCZKKPORO; 8; 9; 10; 9BA7355CV)\n- Down line 2: Down | 3–6 months | Escalation regime: higher pass-through, margins compression; near-shoring/realignment; Geopolitics Shock signals (Japan anti-dumping) amplify risk | Watch tariff expansion pace, steel quota progress, cross-border capital shifts, geopolitics signals | 35–50% (RHFWI02JT; 2SJORBV6H; QRX2HD4X0)\n- For the Trade/Outlook plan: if you treat the regime as not tradable, render a single Outlook line (Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence) that clearly references the anchors (Adyen, Intel CHIPS, cross-border policy) in a concise form; e.g. Neutral-to-moderate constructive | multi-year | Tariff framework persists with sector-specific pass-through; cross-border financing adjustments; | Signals: Adyen geographic expansion; Intel governance updates | Invalidation: durable deregulation surge or Geopolitics Shock derailing baseline | Trigger: concrete policy steps or governance shifts | 65% | 68\n- Throughout, keep lines tight, ensure no filler, and place each numeric claim with its ID immediately after the clause; cross-check that all critical sources (especially RHFWI02JT, Scraped Source 2/3, QRX2HD4X0, 2SJORBV6H, 5M9M1KACF, 9W8ZUIBDY, WLXM1819K, AJTHKYXQ3) are represented where relevant and that any conflicts are acknowledged and reconciled within the four-line map.",
