  "content": "An ongoing \u00a3600m campus investment plan at Southampton is helping drive a surge in applications, which have never been higher than in the past two years. Even an 8% increase in the number of admissions in September 2024, causing them to reach their highest level since 2015, still left stiff competition with almost eight applications per place. Southampton is one of the 24-strong Russell Group of research-intensive universities which also tend to command the highest entry requirements. A contextual offers scheme that knocks two A-level grades off standard entry requirements helps to widen access. An extensive web of careers support ensures that opportunities for graduates to land high-skilled jobs and earn high salaries - one of the university's strongest performance outcomes - extend to students from all backgrounds, too. Mental health and wellbeing support is also among the best. The university is based on several sites across Southampton, with the main Highfield campus being the mothership and the focus of much of the ongoing developments that include a new STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) teaching building and a clinical skills hub. Engineering is the biggest subject area here and one in which the university enjoys considerable success in our subject rankings. Investment is also being put into its city centre campus site and the outlying Winchester campus, home to the Winchester School of Art.\n\nSouthampton's undergraduate bursary is paid to all students from homes where annual income is less than \u00a336,200. A lower rate of \u00a31,000 per year is paid to those from homes with income of between \u00a323,201 and \u00a336,200, while \u00a32,000 per year is paid to those from homes where income is \u00a323,200 or less. A student support fund offers help to those struggling with living costs via grants of up to \u00a33,500 per year. There are also funds for technology, placement support, and health and well-being, introduced as part of the university's response to the cost of living crisis. The ignite your success scheme for up to 60 UK and international students provides internships, peer mentoring, and access to alumni and prospective employers, as well as paying bursaries worth \u00a310,000 paid in roughly equal instalments over three years or awards worth \u00a33,000 paid over three years. Applicants from homes in the 20% of postcodes considered the most deprived, those who have been in care or received free school meals, and participants in the ignite your journey outreach programme are eligible for the awards, which are made based on an application form and an interview. Overall, 24% of students received some form of financial support in 2023-24. Southampton has 6,250 rooms in student accommodation. Self-catered rooms are priced between \u00a35,536 for a 41-week tenancy and \u00a315,103 for the most expensive accommodation on a 51-week let. Catered accommodation costs between \u00a38,995 and \u00a310,857 for 41 weeks.\n\nSouthampton's \u00a3600m campus investment programme will transform the institution's campuses. Among the key additions will be a new STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) teaching building, a precision biosciences hub, and a clinical skills teaching hub. All will encourage greater collaboration with outside organisations, while increasing the presence of medicine - one of the university's strongest suits - on the main Highfield campus. More generally, this site is getting a spruce up with new landscaping and improvements to public spaces. A new teaching and learning centre is under construction containing lecture theatres, a caf\u00e9, a student hub, places for independent study and academic workspaces for the faculty of medicine. An extension to the university's Jubilee Sports Centre opened for the 2024-25 academic year. It includes an indoor cycling studio and a martial arts space; three squash courts; and a climbing centre with speed climbing and top rope climbing options to complement the existing bouldering facilities. The university is continuing to develop its new city centre campus, growing its presence in Southampton's cultural quarter, while there is significant investment in its Winchester campus, home to the Winchester School of Art, to improve facilities and improve the student experience. Among the new degrees planned for September 2026 are a BA in luxury brand management, a BScs and MScis in earth sciences and microbiology. The university will also introduce an MSc in advanced audiology.\n\nStudent support is extensive and spans mental health/well-being and careers. Southampton graduates are among the best paid and most likely to land high-skilled jobs and a web of support ensures that opportunities to succeed are open to all students including those drawn from non-traditional backgrounds. The university's new successful futures programme embeds career planning and employability across all degrees to ensure equity of access to careers education, while the my generation scheme provides careers coaching to students who are the first in their family to go to university. Further initiatives such as the vice-chancellor's progression scheme and career vision plus also target practical and financial support on students from under-represented backgrounds. Southampton is one of just 17 universities to be awarded the student minds university mental health charter award in recognition of its holistic efforts to support student well-being. All academic employees, including personal tutors, are required to complete a training module on support services and how to raise a concern about a student, while all security undertake mandatory first aid for mental health training. From the 2025-26 academic year all staff will be trained on how to recognise mental health concerns in students. The university has a compulsory consent training course for all new students. Southampton made contextual offers at up to two A-level grades (or equivalent) lower than standard entry requirements to one in seven applicants last year. Among those eligible are those from postcodes among the 20% considered to be the most deprived or from which the fewest progress on to higher education, those who have received free school meals, those who have been in care or are estranged from their families, and students who have participated in one of Southampton's outreach programmes.",
