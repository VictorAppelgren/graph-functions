  "title": "Emmanuel Haro died from long-term abuse, district attorney alleges",
  "description": "Officials said at a press conference on Aug. 27 that they believe 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro was abused before his death.",
  "content": "Emmanuel Haro died after years of prolonged abuse, officials alleged Aug. 27 as they continue to search for the 7-month-old's body.\n\nOn Aug. 26, Jake and Rebecca Haro, Emmanuel's parents, were each charged with murder and knowingly making a false report of a crime.\n\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested them on Aug. 22 at their home in Cabazon, California, located about 25 miles northwest of Palm Springs.\n\nRebecca Haro initially told authorities the infant had been kidnapped on Aug. 14 outside a store in nearby Yucaipa. Investigators determined the kidnapping never occurred, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department (SBCSD) said in a release.\n\nIn an interview with The Press-Enterprise from jail on Aug. 24, Rebecca Haro maintained that her son was kidnapped and she and her husband would not hurt the infant.\n\nBrian Cosgrove, a deputy public defender, represented both Jake and Rebecca Haro at their court hearing on Aug. 26. In statements to the media outside the courthouse, Cosgrove did not comment on the allegations, saying he knows nothing about the case beyond the limited information in the complaint.\n\nRiverside County District Attorney Michael Hestrin said at a news conference on Aug. 27 that investigators believe Emmanuel Haro's death was a result of prolonged abuse.\n\n\"The filing in this case reflects our belief that baby Emmanuel was abused, a victim of child abuse over time and that eventually because of that abuse, he succumbed to those injuries,\" he said.\n\nHestrin also said officials have \"a pretty strong indication\" of where Emmanuel's body is, but search operations are still underway.\n\n\"We don't know exactly where the remains are,\" Hestrin said. \"We have some ideas in terms of where we're going to look and where we're going to continue to investigate.\"\n\nProsecutors are not pursuing the death penalty against Jake and Rebecca Haro in this case, and they didn't present the couple with plea bargains, Hestrin said.\n\n\"We're interested in a trial and getting to justice,\" Hestrin said.\n\nHestrin also addressed Jake Haro's previous child cruelty conviction, which stemmed from a 2018 incident involving another child in San Jacinto Valley, according to state court records obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nJake Haro reportedly told police that he accidentally dropped a baby girl while giving her a bath in a kitchen sink, resulting in those charges, according to the Los Angeles Times. Vincent Hughes, who is representing Jake Haro in the 2023 child cruelty case, did not respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment.\n\nIn that case, a judge sentenced Jake Haro to probation in 2023. He was scheduled to appear in court on Sept. 2 for allegedly violating the terms of his probation soon before he was arrested alongside Rebecca in the current case, the court documents show.\n\nThe probation sentence was \"an outrageous error in judgment,\" Hestrin said.\n\n\"That decision was absolutely outrageous. Mr. Haro should have been in prison at the time that this crime happened,\" Hestrin said. \"And if that judge had done his job as he should have done, Emmanuel would be alive today. And that's a shame and it's an outrage.\"\n\nHestrin also said the child victim in the previous case is \"permanently bedridden\" due to a cerebral palsy diagnosis from \"long-term child abuse.\"\n\u2022 Aug. 14: Rebecca Haro reported that Emmanuel had been kidnapped outside a store in Yucaipa shortly before 8 p.m. local time. She said she was standing outside her car while changing his diaper when she was knocked unconscious by an unknown person who took the boy, according to a release from the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\u2022 Aug. 15: Rebecca Haro, with a visible black eye, said in interviews with KCAL and KTLA that the family was in the area for a football practice. She said she went to the store to buy a mouthguard.\n\u2022 Aug. 16: Investigators announced that they interviewed both Rebecca and Jake Haro. After confronting the mother about \"inconsistencies\" in her statements, she declined further cooperation, the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a release.\n\u2022 Aug. 22: San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department deputies arrested Rebecca and Jake Haro and charged them with murder.\n\u2022 Aug. 26: Rebecca and Jake Haro were charged with murder and falsely reporting Emmanuel's kidnapping.\n\u2022 Aug. 27: Riverside County District Attorney Michael Hestrin said officials believe Emmanuel died after long-term child abuse.\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Infant Emmanuel Haro still missing after parents' arrest. What to know.\nThe search continues for Emmanuel Haro, the 7-month-old who is believed to have died. Here\u2019s what we know.\nCalifornia sheriff\u2019s deputies are still searching for a missing infant after his parents were arrested on murder charges.\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro on Aug. 22 at their Southern California home. The boy's mother initially told authorities 7-month-old Emmanuel had been kidnapped on Aug. 14. Investigators determined the kidnapping never occurred.\nThe sheriff's department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Aug. 23.\nHere\u2019s what we know about the case.\nWhat was the initial call?\nThe evening of Aug. 14, deputies responded to the Big 5 Sporting Goods store in Yucaipa, about 20 miles from the Haro family\u2019s home in Cabazon, a desert community in the Inland Empire, less than 20 miles from Palm Springs. Rebecca Haro, 41, told officials that while she was standing outside her car in the parking lot changing her son\u2019s diaper, she was physically assaulted by an unknown man who left her unconscious, according to a sheriff\u2019s news release. When she came to, she explained to officials, her infant son was gone.\nAs local news station KTLA reported, friends and family had gathered at the Big 5 parking lot to conduct searches. Rebecca Haro, with a visible black eye, told reporters she and her husband, Jake Haro, 32, and their two other children had been at a nearby park for their older son\u2019s football practice.\nAt around 7 p.m., she drove to Big 5 to buy a mouthguard for her older son. In the parking lot, she said she had to change the baby\u2019s diaper when she was attacked. There were no witnesses, reported KTLA.\nDeputies then began searching but said they found inconsistencies with Rebecca Haro\u2019s initial statement. When she was asked about those inconsistencies, she stopped speaking with officials, the sheriff\u2019s department said.\nDeputies have said they couldn\u2019t rule out foul play in the infant\u2019s disappearance.\nWhat happened in the search?\nOn Aug. 18, the sheriff\u2019s department said investigators \u201cconducted extensive searches\u201d in Yucaipa and Cabazon for Emmanuel. They were also reviewing surveillance videos. Community members began reporting information, including possible sightings, but officials were unable to locate the infant.\nOn Aug. 20, the sheriff\u2019s department said Emmanuel continued to be the main focus of the investigation. Mara Rodriguez, a department spokesperson, confirmed to USA TODAY that investigators seized a car belonging to Jake Haro for evidence processing.\nLocals set up a small memorial for the boy, with toys and signs such as \u201cWhere is baby Emmanuel?\u201d The Los Angeles Times reported that residents held a vigil for the boy on Aug. 21.\nHow were the parents arrested?\nOn Aug. 22, deputies arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro at their home. The LA Times reported that armored vehicles rammed their front gate.\nDeputies booked them into a county jail without bail. Officials said there were no other suspects.\n\u201cWhile these arrests mark a significant development, our focus remains on finding Emmanuel,\u201d an Aug. 22 sheriff\u2019s department news release said.\nCrowds gathered outside the house after the parents' arrests.\nJake Haro's previous criminal offenses\nAccording to state court records obtained by USA TODAY, Jake Haro was convicted in June 2023 of willful child cruelty for an incident involving another child in the nearby town of Hemet. He was due to appear in court on Sept. 2 for arraignment on allegations he violated the terms of his probation, the documents state.\nThe charges stem from an incident during which Haro told police that he had been giving a baby girl a bath in a kitchen sink. During the bath, he said, he accidentally dropped her. A doctor\u2019s report said the girl\u2019s injuries did not fit that narrative, the LA Times reported.\nVincent Hughes, who is representing Jake Haro in the 2023 child cruelty case, told the LA Times that the incident had nothing to do with Emmanuel.\n\u201cJake has a criminal past,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe\u2019re not running from that, but the facts of that case are a lot different than the facts of this case. And one crime doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve committed every other crime known to man, especially to take your own child.\u201d\nThe attorney also told the outlet that Jake Haro and his wife \"just want their son back,\" adding that \"they want people to put in the same effort that they\u2019re using to question them to go out and search for Emmanuel.\"\nUSA TODAY contacted Hughes on Aug. 23 but has not received a response."

      "text": "Fed governor Cook to sue over Trump\u2019s attempt to fire her from Fed. What's next.\nPresident Donald Trump on Aug. 25 announced he was firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move that brings the president one step closer to shaping the balance of the Fed's seven-member board in his favor.\nIn a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump claimed \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook immediately, pointing to accusations that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.\nCook said Aug. 26 the president lacked authority to oust her from the board of the central bank. She plans to challenge the move in court, according to a statement from her attorney.\nThe move comes amid Trump's monthslong efforts to influence the Fed's decisions on interest rates. Trump had previously focused on pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates through name-calling and termination threats, although he has since walked back threats to remove Powell.\nHere's what to know:\nWall Street mostly shrugs off firing\nU.S. stocks closed higher Aug. 26 despite the White House\u2019s attempt to remove Cook.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, adding 135.6 points to 45,418.07. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, or 26.62 points, to close at 6,465.94. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite closed at 21,544.27, up 0.4% or 94.98 points.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped about two basis points to close near 4.258%, while the 30-year bond closed higher. Investors were likely responding to \u201cbroader financial market stability concerns and the risk that the President's decision weakens demand for this week's two-year, five-year, and seven-year Treasury auctions,\u201d said Oxford Economics Lead Analyst John Canavan in a note.\n\u2013 Andrea Riquier\nTrump says Cook firing will soon give him \u2018a majority\u2019 on Fed board\nTrump touted soon having \u201ca majority\u201d of the appointments on the seven-member Federal Reserve board of governors following his attempted firing of Cook.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a majority shortly, so that will be great,\u201d Trump said during a lengthy Cabinet meeting. \u201cOnce we have a majority, housing is going to swing and it\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\nTrump said he has \u201csome very good people\u201d in mind as possible replacements to Cook, who he announced he terminated from the board in an Aug. 25 letter.\n\u201cI think I, maybe in my own mind, have somebody that I like,\u201d Trump said, adding that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will also be involved in the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important decision.\"\nTrump suggested he might switch Stephen Miran, his nominee to fill the final months of recently departed Fed Governor Adriana Kugler\u2019s term, to instead fill Cook\u2019s significantly longer term, which runs through until 2038. Trump would then pick a different person to replace Kugler.\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s term ends in 2026, giving Trump another opportunity to sway the composition of the board.\nMeanwhile, Trump brushed off Cook\u2019s announcement that she plans to sue the president over his attempt to fire her. \u201cYou always have legal threats. I had a legal fight that went on for years with crooked people, very horrible people,\u201d Trump said referring to the criminal charges he faced after his first term in office.\n\u2013 Joey Garrison\nFed says it will abide by court decision\nThe Fed on Aug. 26 said it will abide by any court decision on Trump's efforts to remove Cook from the Federal Reserve board of governors.\nThe Fed\u2019s statement also says its governors' long, fixed terms are a \u201cvital safeguard\u201d that ensure monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis and long-term economic interests for Americans, and that a president can only fire governors \u201cfor cause.\u201d\nWhile Trump's move to fire Cook has raised concerns over the central bank's autonomy, the Fed said it \"reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses,\" according to an emailed statement.\n\u2013 Bailey Schulz\nTrump addresses Lisa Cook's plans to sue\nTrump said he was prepared for a legal fight over his efforts to fire Cook.\nCook's attorney, Abbe Lowell, earlier in the day said Trump has \u201cno authority\u201d to remove the Fed governor, and announced plans to file a lawsuit challenging the action. Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud when announcing his intention to fire Cook.\n\u201cShe seems to have had an infraction and she can\u2019t have an infraction, and especially that infraction, because she\u2019s in charge of \u2013 if you think about it \u2013 mortgages. And we need people that are 100% above board, and it doesn\u2019t seem like she was,\u201d Trump said after an Aug. 26 Cabinet meeting.\nThe Fed can influence mortgage rates, but interest rate cuts won't always lead to cheaper home loans. USA TODAY has previously reported mortgage rates follow the path of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, not the banking rates the Fed sets.\n\u2013 Bailey Schulz\nDoes Lisa Cook support interest rate cuts?\nWhile Cook has voted in line with the FOMC majority to keep interest rates steady in recent months, Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist, and Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard, said Cook has generally been one of the committee's more dovish members, meaning she generally favors lower rates.\n\u2013 Rachel Barber\nWill firing Cook lead to lower interest rates?\nSkordeles said if Trump wants lower interest rates, going after Cook or Powell isn't necessarily the way to get them. He and Chubb both emphasized that while the Fed does influence long-term interest rates, it does not directly set them.\n\"The Fed controls overnight rates. They don't control prevailing interest rates,\" Skordeles said. \"This notion that the Fed's going to cut and rates are going to go down \u2014 and, oh great, sunshine, unicorns, and confetti \u2014 that's not how rates work.\"\n\u2013 Rachel Barber\nWas Trump justified in firing Lisa Cook?\nTrump said he fired Fed governor Lisa Cook because of allegations of mortgage fraud, which he called \u201cpotentially criminal,\u201d and she vowed to fight her removal.\nLegal experts said Congress authorized the president to remove Federal Reserve officials for \u201ccause,\u201d which means a good reason. Trump\u2019s justification doesn\u2019t pertain to Cook\u2019s work at the Fed and she hasn\u2019t had a chance to respond formally to the allegations. She hasn\u2019t been charged.\nThe dispute over whether Trump had \u201ccause\u201d to fire Cook will likely be the foundation of her legal fight against being removed and could eventually be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\u201cWhat constitutes cause is not clear as a legal matter,\u201d Kathryn Judge, a law professor at Columbia University, told USA TODAY. \u201cNo previous president has ever tried to fire a Fed governor for cause.\"\n\u2013 Bart Jansen\nCook to file lawsuit\nCook is filing a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s move to fire her from the Fed\u2019s board of governors.\nCook\u2019s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said Trump has \u201cno authority\u201d to remove Cook, and that the president's attempt \u201clacks any factual or legal basis.\u201d\n\u201cWe will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,\u201d Lowell said in an emailed statement.\nThe Federal Reserve Act of 1913 says a president can only fire a Fed governor \"for cause.\u201d Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused Cook of lying on applications for home mortgages in 2021.\n\u2013 Bailey Schulz\nWho is Lisa Cook?\nFormer President Joe Biden appointed Cook as governor of the Federal Reserve in 2022, making her the first Black woman in the role. She was reappointed in 2023 for a term set to end in 2038.\nBefore joining the Board, Cook served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama. From 2000 to 2001, she worked as a senior adviser on finance and development in the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of International Affairs. She also worked as a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University.\nAs one of seven members on the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, Cook plays a leading role in guiding U.S. monetary policy. She has voted with the majority to keep interest rates steady in recent months, despite Trump\u2019s calls for the committee to lower them.\n\u2013 Rachel Barber\nWhat is the Fed?\nThe Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, is tasked with keeping prices stable and employment rates high.\nA seven-member board of governors, led by Chair Powell, as well as five of 12 regional Federal Reserve bank presidents make up the Fed\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee. This group holds eight regularly scheduled meetings each year to decide monetary policy, including interest rate adjustments.\nThe Fed raises its key interest rate when inflation is high to make borrowing more expensive and cool economic activity. When unemployment is high, it can cut rates to promote economic growth.\n\u2013 Bailey Schulz\nCook says Trump can't remove her\nCook, in a statement released by her lawyer, said of Trump that \"no causes exist under the law, and he has no authority\" to remove her from the job she was appointed to by former President Joe Biden in 2022.\n\"I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy,\" she said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.\nAbbe Lowell, Cook's attorney, said Trump's \"demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority. We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent this attempted illegal action.\"\nCongressional Black Caucus slams Trump\n\u201cIn the 111-year history of the Federal Reserve, no president has ever attempted to remove a governor of the central bank until now,\" the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement torching Trump's moves to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve board.\n\"President Trump is attempting to oust Dr. Lisa Cook \u2212 the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board \u2212 with no credible evidence of wrongdoing,\" the group said. \"This is a blatant effort to distract from his failure to lower costs for Americans and a transparent attempt to install a loyalist at the central bank who will carry out his agenda without question.\"\nStock futures down after Trump moves to fire Fed governor\nU.S. stock futures are lower after President Donald Trump fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, saying she submitted fraudulent mortgage applications.\n\u201cI have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position,\u201d Trump wrote in a letter to Cook posted on social media.\nAt 6:15 a.m ET, futures tied to the blue-chip Dow fell -0.14%, while broad S&P 500 futures slipped -0.08% and tech-heavy Nasdaq futures lost -0.06%.\n\u2013 Medora Lee\nWhat does Cook's firing mean for the Fed?\nCook's firing escalates Trump's efforts to reshape the Fed's makeup to his liking.\nGovernor Adriana Kugler, another Biden appointee, announced an early resignation in August. Trump nominated Stephen Miran, who chairs the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, to serve the roughly six months remaining of Kugler's term, although Miran has yet to be confirmed by the Senate.\nThe board also has two Trump-appointed board members, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both of whom have expressed support for lower rates.\nPowell, who was appointed by Trump as chair in 2017 and reappointed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden, is set to end his term as chairman in May 2026, although he could serve as a governor until 2028. Cook was nominated to the Fed's board of governors by Biden, along with board members Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr.\nIf Miran replaces Kugler and Cook is ousted from her seat, Trump's nominees would have a majority on the seven-person board.\nThe board members, along with the five presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks, make up the Federal Open Market Committee, which decides the Fed's key interest rate.\nDoes this mean the Fed will lower interest rates in September?\nPowell had already signaled that the Fed could move toward interest rate cuts soon.\nThe Fed adjusts interest rates to support its dual mandate of keeping prices stable and employment high. When inflation is high, the Fed can raise rates to make borrowing more expensive and cool economic activity. When unemployment is high, cutting rates can promote economic growth and hiring.\nThe Fed has kept rates steady since late 2024 amid concerns that tariffs could drive up consumer prices, but that could soon change. While the Fed has yet to commit to a rate cut, Powell on Aug. 22 said \"the balance of risks appears to be shifting\" as the downside risks to employment rise, which \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"\nWhat does this say about the Fed's independence?\nThe central bank was established as an independent agency so that its decisions are based on what's best for the economy. Confidence in the Fed's autonomy could take a blow if the Fed bows down to a president's demands without a sound basis.\n\"The concern is the intent of the Trump administration: it's not to preserve Fed integrity, it's to install Trump's own people at the Fed,\" said Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, of Cook's firing, as reported by Reuters. \"It goes back to trust in institutions... It's another crack in the edifice of the United States and its investibility.\nAnalysts say that could erode the value of the U.S. dollar, which has already grown weaker this year.\n\"The dollar continues to weaken as American governance continues to erode,\" said Skanda Amarnath, executive director of think tank Employ America and a former Fed economist. \"That means higher prices for all commodities.\"\nWhat happens next?\nCook has previously said she has \"no intention of being bullied to step down.\" After Trump asked her to resign on Aug. 20, Cook said she was gathering information to answer \"any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"\nContributing: Reuters\n(This story was updated with new information)"

She took him out of the car seat and placed him on the chair. At that moment, she said she was hit from behind and Emmanuel was taken. \"Someone said, 'Hola.' I couldn't even turn, I don't remember nothing,\" Haro said.\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Department deputies and K9 units responded Thursday night with scent-tracking dogs and searched for the child and any possible suspects.\nOn Friday, Haro, her husband, and friends showed up at the Big 5 parking lot in Yucaipa to hand out flyers, desperate for Emmanuel's return.\n\"To the person who took my son, please just give him back to us we'll forgive you. We won't bother you, we just want our baby boy,\" Emmanuel's father, Jake Haro, said.\nInvestigators said Emmanuel was last seen wearing a black Nike onesie. He weighs about 21 pounds, is 24 inches tall, has brown hair, brown eyes, and is cross-eyed.\nDeputies continue their investigation, and the baby has not been located yet. Anyone with information can call 911 or Sheriff's Dispatch at (909) 387-8313."

      "text": "Mother of missing 7-month-old refused a polygraph test but is cooperating, lawyer says\n- Share via\nThe parents of a missing 7-month-old boy in Yucaipa are cooperating with law enforcement despite claims from investigators that they cut off communication, an attorney representing the father said Tuesday.\nEmmanuel Haro disappeared after his mother, Rebecca Haro, said she was attacked in a parking lot last week and knocked out. She told detectives with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department that when she woke up, her son was gone.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department said it cannot rule out foul play in the case but has not named any suspects.\nSince then, authorities have searched the Cabazon home where the family lives and said that the parents have stopped cooperating with the investigation.\nBut according to an attorney for the boy\u2019s father, Jake Haro, the family is still cooperating, and Rebecca Haro only refused to take a polygraph when it was requested by law enforcement.\nAuthorities said she gave contradictory statements, but Vincent Hughes, who is representing Jake Haro in a separate case, said she was overcome with emotion because of her missing son.\n\u201cNo attorney in their right mind would allow that to happen, and no person should ever consent to a lie detector test when it\u2019s not even scientifically proven to be admissible in court,\u201d Hughes told The Times on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe fact of the matter remains: How does a normal person act in this situation?\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThere\u2019s John Walsh on one extreme. You have Casey Anthony on the other extreme. Where is their normal between there? How does anyone act when their 7-month-old baby magically disappears?\u201d\nEmmanuel was reported missing Thursday under suspicious circumstances after his mother said she was attacked and knocked unconscious outside a Big 5 store in Yucaipa, according to a San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department media press release.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies arrived and searched the area but could not find Emmanuel. The boy was last seen wearing a black onesie, authorities said.\nAuthorities did not disclose whether Rebecca Haro had suffered any visible injuries. During her interview with detectives, officials said, she was confronted with inconsistencies from her initial statement and stopped speaking with investigators.\nHughes said law enforcement provided a \u201cvague statement\u201d about Rebecca Haro\u2019s inconsistencies but has not elaborated or clarified that the parents are cooperating with the investigation. The Sheriff\u2019s Department has not issued a missing person flier, Hughes said, and has not provided Emmanuel\u2019s parents with any updates about the case.\nA sheriff\u2019s spokesperson said they have shared all information about the case over social media and that Hughes requested all further communication with the couple be made through him.\nAccording to court records, Jake Haro was convicted in June 2023 of willful child cruelty for an incident involving another child in Hemet. He\u2019s due to appear in court on Sept. 2 for a violation of his probation, and Hughes is defending him in that case.\nThat case is separate and has no connection to the Haros\u2019 child missing, Hughes said.\n\u201cJake has a criminal past,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe\u2019re not running from that, but the facts of that case are a lot different than the facts of this case. And one crime doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve committed every other crime known to man, especially to take your own child.\u201d\nThe couple surrendered their phones to investigators and allowed detectives to search their Cabazon home, Hughes said. Investigators also took two iPads, including one that had not been taken out of the box, and three Xbox video game consoles.\n\u201cJake has and continues to state that law enforcement is free to come, free to look around,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t ran. I want to make sure that the public is aware they have not gone anywhere. They\u2019re still in the family home, scared for their safety.\u201d\nOver the weekend, investigators and police dogs searched the family home in Cabazon. The Sheriff\u2019s Department says it has served multiple search warrants at the home and is reviewing surveillance footage from areas of interest in the case."

Swift made \"The Alchemy\" the closing credit song for the concert, replacing \"You're On Your Own Kid.\" She also incorporated \"So High School\" into her set list for year two with moves inspired by Kelce's end zone dances. In the lyric video, the football lights show a \"TS\" and \"TK\" in light pink at 0:43.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Taylor Swift reporter Bryan West on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "Emmanuel Haro disappearance: Police seize father's car in search for missing 7-month-old\nPolice in California have seized a car belonging to the father of a missing 7-month-old as they investigate the baby's disappearance.\nThe car, which belongs to Emmanuel Haro's father Jake Haro, was \"collected for evidence processing,\" Mara Rodriguez, public information officer for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department (SBCSD), confirmed to USA TODAY on Aug. 20.\n\"Investigators have not ruled out anyone\u2019s involvement and are following up on all leads and tips,\" Rodriguez said.\nSBCSD said in a release on Aug. 20 that Jake Haro has retained an attorney, but detectives would still \"welcome their cooperation as we continue efforts to locate Emmanuel.\"\nRebecca Haro, Emmanuel's mother, said he was kidnapped outside a retail store in Yucaipa, California, on Aug. 14 before 8 p.m. local time, according to a release from SBCSD.\nHowever, police said they found \"inconsistencies\" in Rebecca Haro's statements and have not ruled out foul play.\nPossible sighting of missing infant reported, police say\nRodriguez confirmed to USA TODAY on Aug. 20 that investigators have received a report of a possible sighting of the infant.\nThe sighting was in Kern County, but no information as to where in the area has been provided to investigators, Rodriguez said.\nIn an update shortly after 2 p.m. ET on Aug. 20, SBCSD said \"investigators have followed up on the reported sightings\" but Emmanuel Haro has not been located.\nKern County is about 180 miles north of the San Bernardino area, including Yucaipa, where Haro was last seen.\nCabazon, where Haro is from, is about 20 more miles away from Yucaipa.\nWhat happened to 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro? Mother said he was kidnapped\nRebecca Haro told news outlets, including KCAL and KTLA, that the family was in Yucaipa for another child's football practice. She said she went to a sporting goods store to buy a mouthguard for her other child when she realized her infant's diaper needed to be changed.\nShe said she was changing her son's diaper outside her car when a man assaulted her and knocked her unconscious. When she regained consciousness, the infant was gone, Rebecca Haro told police.\nIn interviews with local TV stations, Rebecca Haro appeared with a black eye, which she said she got from the assault.\n\"I took him out of the car seat and laid him on the chair. I had his diapers right here, and someone said, 'Hola.' I couldn\u2019t even turn. I don\u2019t remember nothing,\" Rebecca Haro told the outlets.\nUSA TODAY has been unable to reach Rebecca and Jake Haro for comment.\nPolice continue to investigate baby's disappearance. Here's what has happened so far.\nInvestigators said in an Aug. 18 update they have \"conducted extensive searches\" in both Yucaipa and Cabazon.\n\"Investigators have served several search warrants at the Haro home and utilized K9s to aid in the investigation,\" SBCSD said in a release.\nOfficials also said they are reviewing surveillance video from areas of interest.\nOn Aug. 16, SBCSD said in a release that investigators have not ruled out foul play in Emmanuel's disappearance.\nMultiple people, including Rebecca and Jake Haro, sat for interviews with investigators.\n\"During those interviews, Rebecca was confronted with inconsistencies in her initial statement and declined to continue with the interview,\" the sheriff's department said in the release.\nEmmanuel Haro was last seen wearing a black Nike onesie. He is about 24 inches tall, has brown hair and brown eyes and is cross-eyed, according to police.\nAnyone with information should call Sheriff's Dispatch at 909-387-3545.\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "A subdued Rebecca Haro sat hunched over in a seventh-floor inmate visiting area of the Robert Presley Detention Center in Riverside on Sunday morning and said she wished she were out searching for her missing 7-month-old son, Emmanuel.\n\u201cI will not give up. I will not give up on my baby,\u201d Haro said Aug. 24 in a jailhouse interview with a Southern California News Group reporter, during which she maintained that Emmanuel was kidnapped.\nLaw enforcement authorities believe the baby is dead, and on Friday arrested Haro and her husband Jake Haro at their home in Cabazon on suspicion of murder.\nHaro, 41, sat separated from a reporter by a glass window and communicated through a telephone hookup on Sunday. She wore a blue jail jumpsuit. Her hair, up in a bun as she was led away in handcuffs Friday, was now down to her shoulders. The once-prominent bruise around her right eye has faded but was still noticeable.\nHaro, and her husband Jake, 32, were arrested eight days after the baby\u2019s mother reported that Emmanuel had been stolen from her after a kidnapper knocked her out while she changed the baby\u2019s diaper outside a Big 5 in Yucaipa.\nThough the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department says her story was a lie, she stuck by it on Sunday.\nHaro shook her head side to side when asked about widely circulating rumors that days before she reported the kidnapping, she went to the Big 5, told employees that her car had been burglarized and asked whether the business had surveillance cameras. The sheriff\u2019s department did not respond to questions about the claims.\n\u201cI want to be out looking for my baby,\u201d Haro said, appearing to cry.\nThe crying, the commitment to finding Emmanuel and her account of the boy\u2019s disappearance, however, have all been called into question by investigators and the public.\nOver and over, people have noted Haro\u2019s composed, tearless crying during media interviews. The Uvalde Foundation for Kids, which offered to help the Haros hunt for Emmanuel on foot, withdrew its support when the parents stopped searching and failed to respond to subsequent reach-outs. And San Bernardino County sheriff\u2019s investigators said unspecified \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Haro\u2019s statements raised their suspicions.\nInvestigators searched the Haros\u2019 home and seized electronics belonging to Jake.\nHaro said Sunday that she married Jake Haro in 2021, aware of his previous child cruelty case, and that their relationship has been \u201cwonderful.\u201d\nHe treats her well, she said, and the same goes for her 16-year-old child \u2014 a stepchild to Jake \u2014 and the couple\u2019s 2-year-old daughter, and Emmanuel.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good dad,\u201d Rebecca Haro said. \u201cHe would never hurt a baby.\u201d\nShe said she retained an attorney but declined to provide that person\u2019s name.\nThe Haros have not been charged. A tentative court date of Aug. 26 has been set. Jake Haro, initially booked into the Riverside jail, is now incarcerated at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility in Banning.\nBoth are being held without the possibility of bail.\nAs of Sunday morning, Emmanuel was still missing, said Mara Rodriguez, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department."

      "text": "Cracker Barrel to return to 'Old Timer' logo after Trump, customer backlash\nCracker Barrel announced Aug. 26 that it is dropping its much-criticized new logo and returning to the \"Old Timer.\"\n\"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. We said we would listen, and we have,\" the company wrote in a statement provided to USA TODAY. \"Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"\nThe nationwide restaurant chain and country store, which is known for its comfort food and nostalgic atmosphere, unveiled a new, simplified logo with the launch of a fall menu campaign on Aug. 19.\nThe \"enhanced brand look\" was intended to modernize the company's brand, executives said. The intent includes moving its restaurants away from nostalgia-rich decor to something more contemporary and less cluttered.\nThe change drew sharp criticism from customers and politicians, with both President Donald Trump and the Democratic Party decrying the change.\n\"All of your fans very much appreciate it,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social following the announcement. \"Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!\"\nUSA TODAY followed up with Cracker Barrel asking if the Trump's comments had influenced its decision and did not recieve an immediate response.\nThe company issued a response on its website on Aug. 25 after unveiling a simplified logo days earlier that left some customers unhappy with changes at the restaurant.\n\"If the last few days have shown us anything, it's how deeply people care about Cracker Barrel. We're truly grateful for your heartfelt voices,\" the company said. \"You've also shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"\nAnnouncement draws praise after rebrand incited criticism\nThe reversion to the \"Old Timer\" drew praise in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.\n\"Kudos to their team for making a great decision and may many happy memories and delicious meals continue for the next generation,\" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-TN, said in a post on X.\nBrantley McDonald of North Carolina wrote on the company's Instagram announcement post that, \"WE ARE SO BACK.\"\nBrandon Weems of Tennessee, pithily wrote on the announcement post, \"bullying works.\"\nThe Tennessee-based comfort food chain took a financial hit following the logo announcement, with the stock dropping 7% at the close of trading Aug. 21. The company's stock is up over 9.5% in after-hours trading as of just after 8 p.m. ET Aug. 26, according to Yahoo Finance.\nThe now scrapped logo was part of a larger aesthetic adjustment for the company that has been equally panned.\n\u201cCracker Barrel always stood out for its uniqueness, but now it\u2019s nothing more than a Denny\u2019s with a gift shop,\u201d Destiny Alexander told the Victorville Daily Press \u2013 a part of the USA TODAY Network.\nThis story has been updated\nContributing: Reuters"

The child has been missing for eight days.\n\"This morning, detectives from the Sheriff\u2019s Homicide Detail and Specialized Enforcement Division arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro at their residence in Cabazon for PC 187 \u2013 Murder,\" the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department (SBCSD) said in a post on X shortly after noon ET.\nInvestigators are still searching for Emmanuel Haro, the post said.\nGloria Orejel, SBCSD's public information officer, confirmed to USA TODAY that Jake and Rebecca Haro's arrests are linked to their son's disappearance, but said no additional information is being released at this time.\nRebecca Haro, Emmanuel's mother, told police that her infant was kidnapped outside a retail store in Yucaipa, California, on Aug. 14, according to a release from SBCSD. However, police said they found \"inconsistencies\" in her statements.\nBut the SBCSD said later Friday, Aug. 22 in a news release, \"Based on the evidence, investigators determined a kidnapping in Yucaipa did not occur. It is believed Emmauel is deceased and the search to recover his remains is ongoing.\"\nEmmanuel Haro's parents charged with murder: What we know so far\nSBCSD said that Jake Mitchell Haro, 32, and Rebecca Renee Haro, 41, were arrested and charged with murder under California's penal code 187.

It's unclear whether they have retained legal counsel.\nWhat happened to 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro? Mother said he was kidnapped\nRebecca Haro told news outlets, including KCAL and KTLA, that the family was in Yucaipa for another child's football practice. She said she went to a sporting goods store to buy a mouthguard for her other child when she realized her infant's diaper needed to be changed.\nShe said she was changing her son's diaper outside her car when a man assaulted her and knocked her unconscious. When she regained consciousness, the infant was gone, Rebecca Haro told police.\nIn interviews with local TV stations, Rebecca Haro appeared with a black eye, which she said she got from the assault.\n\"I took him out of the car seat and laid him on the chair. I had his diapers right here, and someone said, 'Hola.' I couldn\u2019t even turn. I don\u2019t remember nothing,\" Rebecca Haro told the outlets.\nPolice are still searching for Emmanuel Haro\nAlthough his parents have been arrested in connection with his murder, Emmanuel Haro's body has not been found. \"While these arrests mark a significant development, our focus remains on finding Emmanuel,\" The SBCSD said in the Aug. 22 afternoon post on X.\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding this investigation are tragic and we will continue to search for Emmanuel,\" Sheriff Shannon Dicus said in department's news release.\nInvestigators said in an Aug. 18 update that they \"conducted extensive searches\" in both Yucaipa and Cabazon, where the family is based. Police said they served search warrants at the family's home and utilized K9s in the investigation.\nOn Aug. 20, Mara Rodriguez, public information officer for SBCSD, confirmed to USA TODAY that investigators seized a car belonging to Jake Haro for evidence processing.\nRodriguez also said that investigators received reports of possible sightings of the boy in Kern County, which is about 180 miles north of the San Bernardino area. However, they did not find the boy after following up on the reports.\nSBCSD previously said in a release that investigators were not ruling out foul play in Emmanuel's disappearance. Multiple people, including Rebecca and Jake Haro, sat for interviews with investigators.\n\"During those interviews, Rebecca was confronted with inconsistencies in her initial statement and declined to continue with the interview,\" the sheriff's department said in the release.\nAuthorities ask that anyone with information about the disappearance call Sheriff's Dispatch at 909-387-3545.\nContributing: Mike Snider\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Record cocaine bust had enough to 'fatally overdose' Florida, Coast Guard says\nThe U.S. Coast Guard offloaded a historic quantity of cocaine, worth hundreds of millions, on Monday, Aug. 25, marking the largest amount of drugs ever offloaded by the agency.\nOn Aug. 25, the Coast Guard announced in a news release that it captured 76,140 pounds of illicit narcotics valued at approximately $473 million in Port Everglades, a seaport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The drugs included roughly 61,740 pounds of cocaine and 14,400 pounds of marijuana.\n\"To put this into perspective, the potential 23 million lethal doses of cocaine seized by the U.S. Coast Guard and our partners, are enough to fatally overdose the entire population of the state of Florida,\" Rear Adm. Adam Chamie, commander of the Coast Guard\u2019s Southeast District, said in the release.\nChamie noted the feat underscored \"the immense threat posed by transnational drug trafficking in our nation.\"\nThe Coast Guard was assisted by the Royal Netherlands Navy ship HNLMS Friesland, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Air and Marine Operations, in addition to other military segments.\nThe Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton, one of four 418-foot Legend-class national security cutters homeported in Charleston, South Carolina, brought the illegal drugs to port.\n\"Team Hamilton with our partners, worked incredibly hard the last several months to safeguard the American public from the dangers of illicit narcotics entering the United States,\" Capt. John B. McWhite, commanding officer, Hamilton, said in the release.\nWhen did the seizures occur?\nThe seizures, which occurred between June 26 and Aug. 18, resulted from 19 interdictions in international waters in the Eastern Pacific Coast and the Caribbean Sea, the Coast Guard said. Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton detained 34 suspected drug traffickers and stopped 11 go-fast vessels throughout the interdictions.\nDrug seizures deny criminal organizations over half of a billion dollars in revenue, according to the Coast Guard's release.\nAuthorities released videos of the seizures showing what occurred during two separate interceptions. In one instance, officials stopped a go-fast vessel approximately 40 miles southwest of Haiti on Friday, Aug. 15. The boat had been detected by a maritime patrol aircraft, and that interdiction resulted in the seizure of more than 1,615 pounds of marijuana.\nIn another incident, Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton intercepted two go-fast vessels suspected of drug smuggling southeast of the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, on Thursday, June 26. In that instance, officials seized more than 4,475 pounds of cocaine.\nAbout 80% of drugs are interdicted on the high seas, according to the Coast Guard.\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Latest in disappearance of Emmanuel Haro: Jake Haro joined police at search location\nOfficials in California are continuing to search for 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro days after charging his parents with murder in his disappearance.\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro on Aug. 22 at their home in Cabazon, California, located about 25 miles northwest of Palm Springs. They have both been charged with murder and are set to appear in court on Aug. 26.\nRebecca Haro, the boy's mother, initially told authorities the infant had been kidnapped on Aug. 14 outside a store in nearby Yucaipa. Investigators determined the kidnapping never occurred, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department (SBCSD) said in a release.\nAs the search for Emmanuel continues, here's what we know so far about the boy's parents and why they are being accused of murder.\nWhat we know about Jake and Rebecca Haro\nPolice arrested Jake Haro, 32, and Rebecca Haro, 41, on one count each of murder on Aug. 22. They were booked into a Riverside County Jail without bail, SBCSD said.\n\"No other arrests have been made, and no suspects remain outstanding,\" the department said on X.\nOne of Jake and Rebecca Haro's other children was removed from the family's home by Riverside County Children's Services, Rodriguez confirmed to USA TODAY on Aug. 25.\nThe Department of Public Social Services said in a statement to USA TODAY that it cannot comment on specific children or family cases due to state confidentiality laws.\nUSA TODAY had been unable to reach Rebecca and Jake Haro for comment prior to their arrests. It's not clear whether they have retained legal counsel.\nJake Haro has previous child cruelty conviction\nAccording to state court records obtained by USA TODAY, Jake Haro was convicted in June 2023 of willful child cruelty for an incident involving another child in the nearby town of Hemet.\nThe charges stem from an incident during which Haro told police that he had been giving a baby girl a bath in a kitchen sink and accidentally dropped her, the LA Times reported.\nBefore his Aug. 22 arrest, Jake Haro was due to appear in court on Sept. 2 for arraignment on allegations he violated the terms of his probation, according to the documents.\nUSA TODAY contacted Vincent Hughes, who is representing Jake Haro in the 2023 child cruelty case, on Aug. 23 but has not received a response.\nHas Emmanuel Haro been found?\nAs of Aug. 25, Emmanuel Haro has not been found. Investigators believe he is dead, and a kidnapping never occurred, SBCSD said on Aug. 22.\nPrior to Emmanuel's parents' arrests, police said that they \"conducted extensive searches\" using K-9s in Yucaipa and Cabazon.\nThey also seized a car belonging to Jake Haro for evidence processing, Mara Rodriguez, public information officer for SBCSD, confirmed to USA TODAY on Aug. 20.\nOn Aug. 24, Jake Haro joined investigators at a search off a freeway in Moreno Valley, the department said in a post on X. Despite using cadaver dogs, the infant was not found, and police said they are continuing their search.\nHow can parents be accused of murder without finding Emmanuel Haro's body?\nA so-called \"no-body homicide\" is uncommon, but not impossible, Ambrosio Rodriguez, a criminal defense attorney and former Riverside County deputy district attorney, told USA TODAY.\n\"Honestly, it happens more often in places where there's large swaths of land like San Bernardino or Riverside County, where it's just easier to bury a body,\" Rodriguez said.\nIn this case, as Emmanuel Haro still has not been found, Rodriguez said it's likely that detectives relied on the parent's inconsistent statements, rather than physical evidence, in order to carry out the arrests.\n\"The importance of physical evidence is something that happens on TV and movies, not in real life. The majority of cases are based on words, not on DNA or anything of that nature,\" Rodriguez said.\nTimeline of Emmanuel Haro's disappearance\nHere's what has happened in the case of the missing child so far.\n- Aug. 14: Rebecca Haro reported that her son, Emmanuel, had been kidnapped outside a store in Yucaipa shortly before 8 p.m. local time. She said she was standing outside her car while changing his diaper when she was knocked unconscious by an unknown person who took the boy, according to a release from SBCSD.\n- Aug. 15: Rebecca Haro, with a visible black eye, said in interviews with KCAL and KTLA that the family was in the area for a football practice. She said she went to the store to buy a mouthguard.\n- Aug. 16: Investigators announced that they interviewed both Rebecca and Jake Haro. After confronting the mother about \"inconsistencies\" in her statements, she declined further cooperation, SBCSD said in a release.\n- Aug. 22: SBCSD deputies arrested Rebecca and Jake Haro and charged them with murder.\n- Aug. 26: Rebecca and Jake Haro are expected to have their first court appearances.\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas and Jonathan Limehouse, USA TODAY\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.
