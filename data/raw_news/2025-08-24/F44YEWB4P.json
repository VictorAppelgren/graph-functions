  "description": "The arrest of the son of a former prime minister with heroin in his car is drawing comparisons to past cases of the elite escaping justice.",
  "content": "Selangor police confirmed late on Sunday that they had detained a man in his twenties, who was found with three grams (0.1 ounces) of heroin and drug paraphernalia in his car.\n\nThe suspect is the son of a former prime minister, according to state police chief Shazeli Kahar as reported by national news agency Bernama. Authorities have withheld his name, however, citing the ongoing investigation and the fact that formal charges have yet to be filed.\n\nThe incident marks the latest in a string of controversies involving relatives of Malaysia\u2019s political elite, fuelling renewed scrutiny over whether the powerful are held to account under the law.\n\nPublic reaction was swift and incredulous, with images of the suspect\u2019s red Ferrari \u2013 where the drugs were discovered \u2013 circulating widely on social media.\n\n\u201cDrug possession as a user and a trafficker both carry different penalties in Malaysia. Don\u2019t be shocked if he can simply be released even after this arrest,\u201d wrote Arif Ayob in one comment.\n\nThe case has drawn comparisons to earlier scandals involving the families of prominent leaders. In 2023, the son-in-law of former prime minister fled the country to escape . while tax authorities continue to pursue more than 1 billion ringgit (US$24 million) in unpaid taxes from former prime minister and his two sons.",

      "text": "After nine years as Malaysia's prime minister, Najib Razak was driven from office in 2018 when he lost a general election to Mahathir Mohamad. The result was a political earthquake in Malaysia, where the Barisan Nasional coalition had held sway for more than 60 years. It also exposed Najib to prosecution over the vast corruption scandal engulfing state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which he established. Police seized luxury goods worth millions of dollars from Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansoor, and Najib has since been charged over his role in the scandal, including several counts of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power."
