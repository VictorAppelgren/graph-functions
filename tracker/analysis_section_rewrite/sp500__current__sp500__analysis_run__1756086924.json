      "feedback": "The analysis is directionally solid but needs a tighter, timeline-driven core for 0–3 weeks with explicit catalysts, thresholds and invalidation points, plus sharper quantification and source discipline. Actionable edits: rebuild as a compact, date-stamped 0–3 week narrative anchored to three near‑term regimes (HUTCHMED leadership transition with clear data catalysts; PubMatic litigation risk with defined milestones; Spirit Aviation going‑concern disclosures and litigation inquiries). For Hutchmed, foreground the governance transition (CFO Johnny Cheng as Acting CEO) as a near‑term overhang only if accompanied by governance updates, and foreground the data cadence: SACHI Phase III PFS data (no numeric value in sources—call out the need for PFS hazard ratio, median PFS, p-values from ASCO) and SANOVO enrollment completion with the ASCO webcast timing; set explicit watch levels (e.g., if ASCO data show sustained PFS benefit with acceptable safety, trims to risk; if data delay or negative safety signals emerge, reprice risk) and include the ASCO webcast date/time as a monitoring trigger (cite RAV2UWRTT and Y4QWID79M). For PubMatic, separate a litigation risk overlay from fundamentals: clock to Oct 20, 2025 lead-plaintiff deadline, contingency-fee cap of up to one‑third, and the absence of class certification to date (cite 4LDHF4T77, G4GWY9RFT); quantify sentiment risk via known milestones (filings, potential settlements) and, if possible, embed a rough implied overhang range based on Rosen Law Firm’s track record and “over a billion dollars recovered” reference, but avoid implying a specific expected payout. For Spirit Aviation, quantify the immediate shock (going‑concern disclosure within 12 months, 40.7% share decline) and frame the near‑term risk as litigation-driven and liquidity covenant risk; list monitoring points (regulatory filings, covenant status, debt disclosures, Schall Law Firm inquiry timeline) with explicit dates if available (cite Z5IA1CYUF). Across all three, reconcile conflicts by placing each assertion with a single source reference, and explicitly note data gaps (e.g., Hutchmed’s exact PFS numbers; any updated interim results timing) to avoid overclaiming. Finally, tighten language to a single, linear chain: immediate drivers → 0–3 week catalysts → reaction function (price/volatility) → invalidation criteria (governance disruption, data fail, or litigation milestones) and add a crisp “monitor next” line with concrete dates, ensuring the coverage maps to the cited IDs (RAV2UWRTT, Y4QWID79M, 4LDHF4T77, G4GWY9RFT, Z5IA1CYUF) and excludes extraneous material.",
