  "content": "Kelly Ortberg wants Boeing (BA) to straighten up and fly right.\n\nOrtberg, who became the aerospace giant's CEO last August, said in an interview with Aviation Week that \"major culture change is one of my key turnaround focus areas.\"\n\n\"I've talked to our leadership about the need to get close to the people building and designing the airplanes,\" he said. \"We've got to be closer and helping our people be successful. I've done a lot of work in changing the culture of a company. It's not a poster on the wall.\"\n\nOrtberg said people watch leadership's behavior, \"and that's what drives change.\"\n\n\"This is going to be an important year as we drive that into the organization,\" he said. \"People need to see us walk the talk from the top down.\"\n\nBoeing reported Q2 deliveries from its commercial operations totaled 150 planes, including 104 of the 737, 9 of the 767, 13 of the 777 and 24 of the 787. That 150 figure was up 63% from 92 a year earlier. Boeing Defense, Space and Security delivered a total of 36 units in Q2.\n\nThe 2025 second quarter was the best such period since 2018, before two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes five months apart grounded the jets from March 2019 to November 2020.\n\u2022 The head of a low-cost airline drops hints about IPO\n\u2022 3 major airlines secretly sold your data to the government\n\nThe company made headlines last January when an Alaska Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after a door plug on the Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft blew out.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few months later, Boeing said CEO Dave Calhoun would step down. The move was part of a broad management shakeup.\n\nAn article in the July issue of CPA Journal charged that \"the Boeing case is a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when a company fails to develop and implement sound internal quality controls that protect operational processes and encourage a culture of safety.\"\n\n\"At Boeing, whistleblowers reported problems with operating processes that were ignored by management and weren't always reported to the board of directors,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"The company did not use internal audits to identify and correct operational problems, relying instead on FAA inspections to point out safety issues in its 737 MAX aircraft,\" the article continued.\n\nBoeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, investigators probing last month's fatal crash of an Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner are closely examining whether the aircraft's fuel control switches were moved - intentionally or accidentally - just moments before the plane lost thrust and slammed into the ground, The Economic Times reported, citing a Reuters story.\n\nThe London-bound jetliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad on June 12, after climbing to just 650 feet. Of the 242 people on board, only one survived, and several people were also killed on the ground.\n\nShares of Boeing, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on July 29, are up nearly 28% this year and up 23% from this time in 2024.\n\nRelated: Boeing workers sent blunt message on 787 Dreamliner in leaked video\n\nIn March, the U.S. Defense Department awarded Boeing the Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance future fighter jet, known as NGAD.\n\nThe sixth-generation fighter, which will replace the F-22 Raptor, will be designated the F-47.\n\n\"It's the single largest investment we've ever made in a defense program,\" Ortberg said. \"We've been investing for years. This was a well-run competition, and I think we did an excellent job in putting an offer forward that was superior to the competition.\"\n\nOn July 3, Boeing said it had been awarded a $2.8 billion contract for the Evolved Strategic Satellite Communications program, the space-based component of the U.S. nuclear command, control and communications architecture.\n\nThe initial contract is for two satellites, with options for two more in the future.\n\nOn July 9 Susquehanna raised its price target on Boeing to $252 from $240 and affirmed a positive rating on the shares, according to The Fly. The investment firm updated its model following Boeing's report of the June deliveries.\n\nIn light of the data, Susquehanna said, it continues to be encouraged by Boeing's progress on the commercial-production reramp. It said Boeing posted solid deliveries through the first half of 2025.\n\nDeutsche Bank raised its price target on Boeing to $245 from $235 and maintained a buy rating on the shares.\n\nThe firm changed ratings in the defense sector as part of a Q2 earnings preview. U.S. defense \"will again be a mixed bag this earnings season,\" the firm said.\n\nThe Arena Media Brands, LLC THESTREET is a registered trademark of TheStreet, Inc.\n\nThis story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 1:52 PM.",

      "text": "Reuters, quoting three sources familiar with the ongoing investigation, claimed that a preliminary report is expected by Friday. One of the sources said the focus has narrowed to the position and movement of the engine fuel switches, based on data recovered from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, and simulations conducted by Boeing.\nThe London-bound jetliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad on June 12, after climbing to just 650 feet. Of the 242 people onboard, only one survived. Several were also killed on the ground.\nAviation industry publication The Air Current first reported the attention on the switches, which supply fuel to the plane\u2019s two engines. The available data, however, has not yet confirmed whether the switches were improperly, inadvertently, or deliberately activated.\nU.S. aviation safety expert John Cox told media that these switches are designed to be resistant to accidental movement. \u201cYou can't bump them and they move,\u201d he said. Shutting one off would result in an almost immediate loss of power.\nSo far, investigators have found no indications of mechanical failure and no bulletins have been issued to airlines operating the 787.\nIndia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), leading the inquiry, has not responded to media requests. The agency was initially reluctant to allow U.N. involvement, but later reversed course, permitting an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specialist to join as an observer.\nThe crash has dealt a serious blow to Air India\u2019s image amid the Tata Group\u2019s efforts to modernize the airline following its takeover in 2022. It has also sparked a parliamentary review of aviation safety standards, with officials scheduled to testify this week.\nPublic confidence has been shaken further by delays in releasing data and limited government transparency, with just one press conference held since the disaster \u2014 and no questions allowed.\nWhile the report could shed new light on the causes of the crash, the sources cautioned that its scope and details may still change before publication.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online."

      "text": "In Kelly Ortberg\u2019s first in-depth interview since being tapped in August 2024 as president and CEO of Boeing, he met with Aviation Week editors Joe Anselmo, Guy Norris and Sean Broderick at the company\u2019s 737 final assembly factory in Renton, Washington. During the wide-ranging and often frank discussion, Ortberg shared his plans for turning around the company, reforming its culture and navigating market uncertainties.\nAW&ST: The big story for Boeing this year is your win of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F-47 fighter contract. Congratulations. It\u2019s the single largest investment we\u2019ve ever made in a defense program. We\u2019ve been investing for years. This was a well-run competition, and I think we did an excellent job in putting an offer forward that was superior to the competition. We invested in prototype aircraft and facilities, and I think that investment has paid off. So, a huge win for us, because we don\u2019t have a position in the current fifth-generation fighter. To have this sixth generation really sets the stage for our St. Louis fighter operations. We still have the F-15 and F/A-18 programs, but they\u2019re reaching end of life, particularly the F/A-18. So this is going to be really important for us for decades to come.\nBefore Boeing won the F-47, its defense business was widely viewed as floundering. There were even questions about who would want it if you tried to spin it off. It resets the stage for our future in the fighter business. We\u2019ve got the T-7 [trainer] franchise, which is just coming in. We\u2019ve got continuation of the [KC-46] tanker franchise. So this was an important element in several ways. It\u2019s the first sixth-generation program, and we had the technology ready to do that. I think a lot of people were probably surprised at that. What we\u2019ve been doing in the dark cloud in investment for that program really paid off. I\u2019m pleased to say we have what it takes to be providing state-of-the-art, next-generation capability. And some of those things from the defense business will help us as we think about our next commercial platforms as well. So we\u2019ve got what it takes to recover this business. I\u2019m not worried that we\u2019ve lost a step and can\u2019t recover. We\u2019ve just got to execute better.\nYou\u2019ve been big on program execution. What is Boeing doing differently on the F-47? Much more rigorous baseline management, making sure we have our supply chain aligned with the contract. Some of the large fixed-price contracts that we\u2019ve had in the past have been problematic because we didn\u2019t have back-to-back alignment with our supply chain, and that got us into real challenges. So we\u2019ve focused on making sure we\u2019ve got that understood, and we\u2019ve invested heavily to reduce the risk. We\u2019re at a very mature stage for a program of this nature. We\u2019re going to be able to go faster and not incur those risks in the middle of the development program.\nWhat are the two or three biggest risks current tariff policies pose to Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA)? The input tariffs, where we pay a 10% tariff, are predominantly impacting us for wings and fuselages in Japan and Italy. We\u2019re not in a position to pass those [costs] along to our customers. I\u2019m hopeful that, as each of these country-by-country negotiations resolve, those tariffs will go away in the long run. Luckily, 80% of our supply chain comes out of the U.S. In some cases, if you pay a tariff and then [export] the airplane, you actually can draw back on the tariff. A large portion of our backlog is international, so that would be more of a cash timing issue than a margin performance issue.\nThe other issue, probably more impactful, is if any retaliatory tariffs are applied. We are seeing that right now in China, and that is causing Chinese airlines not to take delivery of [U.S.-made] aircraft. We certainly hope this doesn\u2019t escalate to where other countries apply retaliatory tariffs and we get in a situation that we can\u2019t deliver the airplanes we have in the production system today. Now, there is tremendous demand for airplanes overall, so we can [find another buyer] if there is a certain region where we can\u2019t make deliveries. But it\u2019s not easy to shift quickly, because airplanes are painted in an airline livery, the interiors are aligned to that airline, so to go sell that to a different customer takes work. I\u2019m in regular contact with the administration, all the way to POTUS. They are clearly focused on making sure the aerospace and defense business continues to be an export engine. They\u2019re watching very closely, and their intent is to help us, not hurt us. It\u2019s a very dynamic time. Every day is a new day with tariffs.\nBoeing is the prime contractor for NASA\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS) core stage. The Trump administration is proposing to terminate the SLS, and there is much uncertainty about NASA\u2019s future direction. Do you see space as a core part of Boeing\u2019s future? Absolutely. I think some of the challenges we\u2019ve had with Starliner [Boeing\u2019s crew vehicle] have overshadowed our space portfolio. We\u2019ve got a tremendous portfolio, particularly in the secure national security space regime. I think the manned space, commercial and NASA business is going to be dependent on where the budget goes and what the country wants to invest in those programs. But that doesn\u2019t implicate our overall commitment to space and national security space. With the work we\u2019re doing with the X-37B [orbital test vehicle], there are great opportunities for us in the future. We\u2019re a world leader in space. A lot of that is classified business, but we\u2019re going to stay committed to the space sector.\nDo you think the SLS could survive in a different form or at least be extended further? I have no privileged insight to give you. I\u2019m following the budget and the [Trump] administration priorities as much as everybody. We\u2019re just going to have to react to what that is. Whether that\u2019s a few more launches and then a wind-down or a redirection is yet to be seen.\nBoeing\u2019s decision to put NASA\u2019s X-66 Transonic Truss-Braced Wing demonstrator aircraft on ice was a bit of a surprise. Your predecessor, Dave Calhoun, had pointed to the X-66 as a potential pathway to the 737 single-aisle replacement market. What changed? I don\u2019t know if anything really changed as much as the value we thought we were going to get out of the program. We\u2019ve redirected the resources to continue to invest in the areas we think are going to be more impactful to a future aircraft program. So I think it\u2019s making sure we\u2019re not spending valuable resources on a prototype airplane that\u2019s not getting us what we need in terms of technology development. It has been a great program, and we learned a lot from it. And we are going to continue our investments in elements that we think will have value in our future airplanes.\nNamely thin-wing technology? Yes. We didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of our resources on what I\u2019ll call mundane maintenance of an aircraft. We\u2019re focusing on the technology areas. That\u2019s the shift you\u2019re seeing.\nAs you look to Boeing\u2019s next commercial airplane, where do you see the company prioritizing research? The near-term priorities are, from a commercial perspective, getting the current development programs through the certification process. We\u2019re hoping to get the two variants of the 737 MAX wrapped up this year so we can start deliveries of the -7 and the -10, two airplanes that are very, very important to our customers and our backlog. And then the 777-9, which will be the largest dual-engine widebody in the market. We\u2019ve got four [777-9s] in flight test, and we\u2019re making great progress. I think that\u2019s going to be a game-changing platform for us.\nIn terms of what\u2019s next, I view it as different work streams:\nOne: \u201cWhen is the market ready?\u201d Two: \u201cWhen is the technology ready?\u201d And three: \u201cWhen are we ready and can financially handle that?\u201d\nWe\u2019re not ready on any of those work streams today, but we need to be when the market is ready for a new aircraft. Remember, we have half a trillion dollars of backlog, and most of that is commercial products. We have huge demand for those products, and I would say there\u2019s more focus on upgrading existing aircraft, putting new engines and capability on them.\nThere is growing demand for airplanes in the midmarket sector, which Boeing looked at five years ago. Now startups such as JetZero are trying to penetrate that market. Do you think you\u2019ll begin to look at a new product for the 2030s? We\u2019re constantly looking. Looking is one thing; launching is another. We\u2019re in the early innings of our recovery. We\u2019re still in a negative cash situation. We\u2019re going to get that turned around by the second half of the year, but we\u2019ve got to get our company healthy. We\u2019ll continue to do our research to be ready, but I\u2019m not going to put a date on it because all three of those work streams have to have a thumbs-up for us to go. And right now, they all have a thumbs-down. Hopefully our recovery will stay on track, and that will give us more flexibility to do something.\nAre you concerned that Airbus is pulling too far ahead in its market advantage? No. We are behind [in certifying] the 737-10 in that segment of the market. We need to get that airplane certified so we can compete. We\u2019re in great shape with our widebody product line. We\u2019ve got to get the 777 in place. But I\u2019m not too concerned that we\u2019ve fallen significantly behind. We\u2019re doing things in our labs that we\u2019re not talking about to be prepared for the next generation.\nYou\u2019ve called out certification as a focus area for BCA leadership and talked about Boeing needing to be more proactive. Could you expand on that? What I was specifically talking about is working with the FAA in a more proactive way to ensure that we don\u2019t see continuous delays in the certification process, especially when it\u2019s administrative or documentation review or documentation back-and-forth between us and the FAA. I\u2019m very encouraged with the new FAA leadership. I\u2019ve had meetings with Secretary [Sean] Duffy at the Department of Transportation, and he\u2019s come out and talked with our employees. We need to work together to streamline that process. It has gotten way too elongated. We\u2019ve seen progress. We recently got FAA type inspection authorization approvals for the 777-9. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, particularly on the 777X, to get that certification complete. That\u2019s going to be a continued focus for us for the rest of the year.\nThe 777X program was launched at the 2013 Dubai Airshow. You had just become CEO of Rockwell Collins, a key supplier to the program. Could you have ever imagined at that time we would be here in 2025, and it still wouldn\u2019t be in service? No. I\u2019m still shocked. Now, it\u2019s partially driven by circumstances outside of the 777X program. The extra regulations that came out and the whole certification process were driven more by the MAX situation than anything on 777X. It\u2019s amazing that it has not been in service for years. But it isn\u2019t, and the task at hand is to get it over the finish line.\nAre you satisfied with where the program is today? Yes. The performance of the four that are flying is fantastic. We\u2019ve got more hours on this airplane than any other we\u2019ve ever put into production service. So we feel really good about having a good entry into service. Customers have hung with us through that long delay because they see value in the airplane. I think it\u2019s going to be a great product for us once we get through the near-term certification challenge.\nWhere are you on ramping up 737 MAX production? We now have three lines running and flowing, and we have [an FAA-imposed] rate cap of 38 [per month]. It is important to get beyond that 38 rate. What day or month we do that is less important than ensuring we have a stable quality system and that we can move to a higher rate in a stable way. We\u2019re in a cash-negative situation, and for us to be generating cash, we need to have the MAX production up around 38-40 a month. So it\u2019s important to our overall recovery that we increase these rates. But we\u2019re going to do it in a smart, safe way, in accordance with our safety and quality plan. Year-to-date, we\u2019re ahead of our plan on deliveries, and we haven\u2019t been pushing the deliveries; we\u2019ve been pushing the safety and quality plan. So it\u2019s playing out like we want.\nThe current 777F freighter is a valuable cash-earner for you, but under International Civil Aviation Organization emissions rules, production must end in 2027. Can you deliver the existing backlog by that deadline? We\u2019re quite comfortable in being able to deliver the metal-wing freighters and meeting the certification timeline. So as you know, we have another freighter version with the composite wing, so that\u2019ll come later. But yes, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our ability to do that, and our manufacturing flow for the freighters is going quite well.\nAnother delayed program is the new Air Force One. Donald Trump complained about it when he was elected president in 2016. Eight and a half years later, he\u2019s still waiting, and he\u2019s not happy. What changes are you making to execute on this program differently? A lot of changes. The president has asked Elon Musk to oversee and help us as we look at the program. We have been struggling with certain requirements that were just unachievable. In some cases, we\u2019ve gotten relief from those requirements, and Elon has been very helpful. I will tell you that we\u2019ve made more progress on the airplane in the last four months than we made in the last four years. We are closing jobs; the design is getting very, very close to completely closed. And then it\u2019s just a matter of building up the aircraft to that design. I\u2019m pretty pleased with the progress. It\u2019s not fast enough for POTUS, and he\u2019s made that perfectly clear. So we\u2019re going to do everything we can to go faster. Having said that, we\u2019re not cutting any corners. We\u2019ve got to make sure that this is a super-safe airplane and it meets the needs of the president and the national security.\nWhere are you in the program? We\u2019ve been through a series of design reviews. We haven\u2019t published a schedule yet with the Air Force, although I think we\u2019re getting close. The Air Force has made some statements talking about a 2027 delivery, which has pulled up significantly from where it was. So we\u2019ll be making more public announcements on the details of the schedule in concert with the Air Force.\nThe main thrust of Boeing\u2019s internal safety and quality plan is instilling a culture of change all the way down to the factory floor. They have to buy into your system, safety first, the leadership. From your seat as CEO, what is the most effective thing you can do to help drive that change? Major culture change is one of my key turnaround focus areas. I\u2019ve talked to our leadership about the need to get close to the people building and designing the airplanes. That\u2019s literally why I\u2019m here in Seattle. That\u2019s why, right after this interview, I\u2019m going out on the factory floor to talk to people building the 737 MAX. We\u2019ve got to be closer and helping our people be successful. We did a voice-of-the-employee survey this year, the first one in five years. It gave us great feedback on areas where we\u2019ve got to improve. We\u2019re creating action plans to address that. I\u2019ve done a lot of work in changing the culture of a company. It\u2019s not a poster on the wall. People watch the behaviors of the leadership, and that\u2019s what drives change. This is going to be an important year as we drive that into the organization. People need to see us walk the talk from the top down.\nYou\u2019ve made a few changes to your leadership team. Is what we see now the team going forward for the foreseeable future? I think the leadership team is getting pretty well, and that\u2019s helping, as we\u2019re starting to see progress. But we\u2019ll continue to supplement the team as necessary. I think as we move through our values and behavior implementation this year, that could cause some shift in leadership\u2014maybe not at my direct level, but at other levels. Because we\u2019re making it clear that we\u2019re going to shift the culture of the company, and our leaders have to buy into that or we\u2019re going to have to put different people in those roles. We won\u2019t be shy to make the necessary changes we need to drive the culture change that\u2019s important for our future.\nYou\u2019re renowned for what you did with the culture at the old Rockwell Collins. Boeing is a much bigger company. How do you reduce bureaucracy and internal complexity in an enterprise as big as Boeing? It\u2019s a good question. When I ran Collins Aerospace, we had 77,000 employees. At Boeing we have 160,000 employees, so the scale is massively different. And to scale the culture change is probably the biggest challenge I have. When we went through our workforce reduction last fall, we targeted layers of management, and in certain areas we\u2019ve eliminated two entire layers of management so that we can make decisions faster, be more streamlined, get closer to our employees. It\u2019s the same process. It\u2019s just a bigger scale, and it\u2019s going to take more diligence and probably a little longer.\nBoeing had zero write-downs in its first quarter. Does this mean we\u2019re done seeing these every quarter? We had a good quarter, no write-downs, but we are definitely not claiming victory. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do on these fixed-price [military] programs. I am proud of the team\u2019s focus on baseline management, and in some cases where we\u2019re working with the customers to adjust the contract in win-win ways. This allows us to be more successful and them to get their product at an earlier date. The T-7 is kind of our case-study program. We restructured that through a [memorandum of agreement] with the Air Force. We are ticking off the new milestones on schedule, and they\u2019re very pleased. The more we can get into an environment where we\u2019re working with the customer to create the win-win, the less the large [write-downs]. I think we\u2019ve changed our focus and are making progress on these big fixed-price programs.\nBoeing Global Services (BGS) recently divested several businesses that were platform-agnostic. In the future, will BGS be more focused on supporting Boeing programs versus agnostic? There\u2019s two answers to that. The Boeing programs, and certainly the proprietary parts, are critically important to our economic engine and to the support of our customers. That\u2019s super-core to the company. But we also have parts distribution businesses where we\u2019re selling parts that aren\u2019t a part of Boeing. That\u2019s a nice business\u2014it generates a good cash flow and is operating really well. So I think our BGS business remains core to us. [But] we\u2019re looking across portfolios. You mentioned the divestiture that we recently announced out of BGS in our digital data services business. We\u2019ll continue to look at those things that maybe don\u2019t create value to the core of what we\u2019re doing. But in the main, the BGS business is critical to our success, our customers\u2019 success and our future.\nSustainability suddenly seems to be out of fashion. Do you think there\u2019s any chance of the industry making its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050? I think there\u2019s great opportunities for us, but we have to continue to invest in the capabilities [like] SAF [sustainable aviation fuel]. SAF has to play a major role. We\u2019re not a SAF supplier, but we want to make sure that all of our aircraft are 100% SAF-capable. So we\u2019re making those investments and continuing to help the airlines as they look at how they do carbon-credit trading and become more efficient. I think that\u2019s the path. It\u2019s not going to be a silver bullet. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get there, but I think it\u2019s a noble goal, and we ought to continue to drive everything we can to get as close to it as possible."
