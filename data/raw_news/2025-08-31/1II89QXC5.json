  "content": "There have been a plethora of varying rumors for Apple\u2019s next generation spatial computer. Is Apple prioritizing a cheaper model, or going all out with a second generation Pro model? We\u2019ll summarize all of the Vision headset rumors here today.\n\nIn the coming months, Apple will be announcing a spec bump for the Apple Vision Pro. Rumors have fluctuated on whether or not it\u2019ll include an M4 chip or an M5 chip, though things are currently leaning towards the upcoming M5 chip. This\u2019ll bring a great performance boost over the current M2 chip.\n\nApple is reportedly also \u2018prototyping\u2019 new head straps to make the headset feel lighter on your head, despite the general headset remaining mostly unchanged.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019ll be a light refresh. Apple may have a version with a bolstered neural engine compared to a standard M4 or M5 chip.\n\nFurther down the road, Apple is considering more of a Mac dependent version of the Vision Pro. This headset would target users who use the Vision Pro for high-end applications, like surgery overlays and flight simulators. From Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman:\n\nInstead, it\u2019s now working on a Vision Pro that plugs into a Mac. The difference between the two ideas is the level of immersion. The canceled device had transparent lenses; the product still in the works will use the same approach as the Vision Pro. The idea is to create an ultra-low-latency system for streaming a user\u2019s Mac display or for connecting to high-end enterprise applications.\n\nApple was previously working on a version of augmented reality glasses that would pair to a Mac, and it now sounds like Apple is trying to recreate that now-cancelled product in the form of a headset.\n\nThere have been rumors about a cheaper Vision Pro from the moment the product launched, probably even before the product launched. We\u2019ve been hearing about a so-called Vision Air product that reduces weight and price for quite some time now.\n\nIn more recent months, we\u2019ve seen and heard a lot more, and Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman corroborates that Apple is indeed working on a cheaper and lighter Vision Pro. Though, he does note that tariffs might make it more difficult to work on price reductions.\n\nGurman doesn\u2019t provide much detail on how Apple will make it lighter and cheaper, though he does note that Apple wants to resolve neck strain issues. Design work should be done \u2018next year\u2019, and it should be on the market within the following year. So, by 2027, we\u2019ll finally have a lighter Vision Pro.\n\nWhile AR glasses aren\u2019t immediately on the horizon, Apple CEO Tim Cook is reportedly \u201chell bent\u201d on beating Meta to launching a pair of industry leading AR glasses.\n\nHowever, in the interim, we do know that Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses. Think of Meta Ray-Bans, but Apple. They\u2019ll be light glasses with cameras, speakers, mics, but no displays \u2013 making them perfect for interacting with AI. According to Gurman, such a product will launch in 2026.\n\nHopefully Siri and Apple Intelligence are all set by then.\n\u2022 AirTag 4-pack (on sale for 20% off!)",

      "text": "Earlier this week, it was reported that the next-gen Apple Vision Pro will come with the upcoming M5 chip and not the current M4. Not so fast, however, says the source of the M4-powered Apple Vision Pro.\nMark Gurman responded to the apparent code leak that referenced a variety of unannounced Apple hardware, including the next Apple Vision Pro.\nIt was Ming-Chi Kuo who claimed Apple Vision Pro 2 would be powered by the M5 chip and support Apple Intelligence. That was September 2024. Apple added Apple Intelligence support to the current Apple Vision Pro in February 2025.\nMore recently, Gurman has reported for Bloomberg that Apple is using an M4 chip inside the second-generation Apple Vision Pro.\nHaving Apple Vision Pro 2 ship with a chip one generation behind would mirror the current model, which uses the M2 even though it launched after the M3 was already available. The original Apple Vision Pro was announced nearly a year before release, which helps explain why it shipped with the M2 instead of the M3.\nOne takeaway from the code leak suggesting Apple Vision Pro 2 will use the M5 chip is that it doesn\u2019t improve the outlook for a more affordable model. The price gap between the M4 and M5 is negligible compared to the components that drive the $3,500 cost. Still, sticking with the previous-generation chip could serve as one of many cost-saving measures that adds up.\nSo is an M5 Apple Vision Pro essentially a lock? Not exactly. Mark Gurman writes in this week\u2019s Power On newsletter that he continues to hear Apple is testing versions with the M4, adding that it is certainly plausible the company has considered both.\nThis is where the context of the code leak is important. It\u2019s an interesting data point, but I still put significant weight behind Mark Gurman\u2019s reporting.\nAnother thought: what would an M5 do for Apple Vision Pro 2 that M4 can\u2019t? Both are speed boosts over the M2, and as Gurman also writes in this week\u2019s Power On, speed really isn\u2019t what\u2019s holding back Apple Vision Pro for now:\nWhen you get down to the core of the problem, Apple Inc.\u2019s Vision Pro headset isn\u2019t selling well for two reasons: its $3,499 price tag and a lack of sufficiently compelling features. [\u2026]\nIn the near term, Apple isn\u2019t going to dramatically improve the Vision Pro. The next version, coming as soon as this year, will mostly just get a faster chip. [\u2026]\nThe bigger upgrade is coming in 2027, when Apple will release a model that is both cheaper and lighter, I\u2019ve reported.\nI think upgrading Apple Vision Pro with a straightforward processor boost is better than letting the first-gen model age without grace. Still, perhaps the chip we should be most curious about when it comes to Vision and what most people will use if the cheaper one takes off more than the $3,500 version.\nCheck out these great accessories\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Bad news for fans of bad products. Apple won\u2019t be shipping a pair of augmented reality glasses that require a tethered connection to the Mac after all. Mark Gurman at Bloomberg has the exclusive development, including a thorough description of how the product would have worked. Based on Mark\u2019s reporting, this project was buried in compromises that ultimately made it undesirable.\nApple Glasses remains a product that technology enthusiasts want to see from Apple, but this Mac-connected hardware sounded like a dud based on the direction of the project. Apple wasn\u2019t expected to announce and ship hardware until at least 2027.\nHere\u2019s Mark Gurman reporting on the project cancellation:\nApple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\nPeople want to wear a pair of augmented reality smart glasses wherever they go, not when they\u2019re stuck at their desk or behind a laptop. Apple knows that of course, which is why the project initially tried to use the iPhone for compute and not the Mac, but that product wasn\u2019t feasible for Apple.\nHowever, Gurman details a number of new technologies that Apple hoped to use in the tethered smart glasses product.\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\nThe company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\nStill, needing a tethered computer is too tall of an ask to make a hit product.\nMeanwhile, Meta drew attention last year when it showed off a very early prototype of the type of product Apple was developing. Orion, as Meta calls it, costs about $10,000 to even produce and requires a separate compute device for functionality. Meta believes it can bring down the cost and turn Orion into a compelling product in the years ahead.\nAnd while the Mac-connected AR glasses aren\u2019t shipping, Apple still believes in the idea, at least Tim Cook. Here\u2019s what the Apple CEO said about the idea of AR glasses last month:\nYes, it\u2019s a progression over time in terms of what happens with form factors. AR is a huge deal. With Vision Pro, we\u2019ve progressed to what is clearly the most advanced technology we\u2019ve ever done, and I think the most advanced technology in the world in terms of electronics problems. We\u2019ll see where it goes.\nRead Mark Gurman\u2019s full story at Bloomberg.\nTop iPhone accessories\n- Anker 621 Magnetic Portable Charger\n- Ailun iPhone 16 Screen Protector\n- Beats Solo Buds\n- Apple MagSafe Charger (1m)\n- Anker USB-A/USB-C Charger\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Apple Vision Pro launched in early 2024, and now rumors indicate Apple\u2019s follow-up model is almost ready to ship. Here are three upgrades expected with the new Vision Pro 2.\n#1: M4 or M5 chip\nThe current Vision Pro includes an M2 chip as its main processor alongside the brand new R1 chip.\nThere have been conflicting reports around the new chip coming to Vision Pro 2:\n- Ming-Chi Kuo has consistently said M5 will be the new chip.\n- Mark Gurman more recently claimed it would be an M4 instead.\nEither chip seems plausible, and Kuo and Gurman both have strong track records with their reporting.\nWhichever proves true, Vision Pro 2 will get a chip that\u2019s at least two generations better than its predecessor, and possibly three. We don\u2019t yet know the specs of the M5, however they should be revealed soon as part of the new M5 iPad Pro unveiling.\n#2: New, more comfortable head strap\nOne of the most common critiques of the existing Vision Pro hardware is that it\u2019s too heavy.\nThough a lighter weight model is reportedly not coming until 2027, Apple has good news in the interim.\nVision Pro 2 will feature a new strap that, per Bloomberg, is \u201cdesigned to reduce neck strain and head pain.\u201d\nHow much the strap differ from existing options? It\u2019s hard to say, but this is clearly an area in need of change.\n#3: Upgraded Neural Engine for AI and more\nFinally, regardless of whether the new Vision Pro includes an M4 or M5 chip, it seems Apple has a custom build coming with special upgrades to the neural engine.\nMark Gurman writes at Bloomberg:\nApple is also testing versions of the new device that increase the number of cores inside of the neural engine \u2014 a component for processing artificial intelligence tasks. The neural engine in the current Vision Pro includes 16 cores, a measure of processing power. These capabilities are critical for a device that relies on AI for the live processing of imagery and applications in complex virtual environments.\nVision Pro 2 features: wrap-up\nReporting indicates Vision Pro 2 will largely be a spec bump update, but there\u2019s certainly potential for a new strap to make a big difference for users.\nAnd fortunately, if that proves true, I suspect this strap will also be available for existing Vision Pro owners to purchase separately.\nVision Pro owners are unlikely to shell out another $3,499 for upgraded chips, but if Apple\u2019s strap solution can alleviate the weight problem, then that paired with visionOS 26 could make for some nice improvements to the existing Vision Pro hardware.\nWhat features do you most want to see in Vision Pro 2?

      "text": "Apple is expediting its plans to compete with Meta\u2019s popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Bloomberg reports today that Apple is now aiming to release smart glasses \u201cat the end of next year.\u201d Simultaneously, the company has dropped its plans to release an Apple Watch with a built-in camera.\nApple\u2019s AI smart glasses coming next year\nThe report says that Apple will \u201cstart producing large quantities of prototypes at the end of this year.\u201d The glasses will reportedly have built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers so they can \u201canalyze the external world and take requests via the Siri voice assistant.\u201d Other features on the docket include support for taking phone calls, playing music, turn-by-turn directions, and live translation.\n\u201cOne person with knowledge of the glasses said they will be similar to the Meta product but better made,\u201d the report says. The work is being spearheaded by Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which spearheaded the work on Vision Pro as well.\nThere are reportedly concerns inside Apple, however, that the company\u2019s ongoing struggles in AI could hinder these smart glasses:\nPeople working on Apple\u2019s smart glasses remain concerned that its AI failings may undermine the new product. The Meta Ray-Bans and upcoming glasses running the Android operating system benefit from the strength of Meta\u2019s Llama and Google\u2019s Gemini artificial intelligence platforms.\nToday, Apple uses Google Lens and OpenAI for analysis of the real world via the iPhone\u2019s Visual Intelligence feature. The company will likely want to roll out its own technology for that with the upcoming hardware\nBloomberg had previously reported that Apple was also developing future Apple Watch models with built-in cameras. That project, however, has reportedly been shelved as of this week. Work on AirPods with built-in cameras is still ongoing.\nRead the full report at Bloomberg.\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nI\u2019m glad to see Apple expediting its work on these Meta-like smart glasses. It\u2019s an industry that Apple realistically should have already entered, but shipping this product by 2026 is better than the previously-reported timeline of 2027.\nLike the Apple Watch, Apple\u2019s smart galsses will also benefit from their deep integration with the iPhone and the broader Apple ecosystem.\nMy favorite iPhone accessories:\n- Anker Power Bank with built-in USB-C Cable\n- Charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time\n- Bring wireless CarPlay to any car\n- Anker MagSafe Power Bank\nFollow Chance: Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, and Mastodon.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Tim Cook really wants Apple to make true AR glasses. He \u201ccares about nothing else\u201d, according to an Apple engineer. That said, building true AR glasses will take a lot of time.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman though, Apple is developing \u201cits own glasses with cameras and microphones\u201d in the meanwhile, similar to Meta Ray-Bans. Despite this interim product, AR glasses are Tim Cook\u2019s \u201ctop priority.\u201d\nThese glasses would tap heavily into Siri and Visual Intelligence, as part of Apple\u2019s AI push. However, Apple has some privacy concerns with allowing the glasses to capture media, something that would differentiate it quite heavily from Meta\u2019s offering.\nRegardless, Gurman\u2019s report describes it as an \u201cinterim solution\u201d until the company is able to develop true AR glasses. Developing AR glasses still requires a number of technologies to \u201cbe perfected.\u201d Even if all of the components are up to spec, it still needs to manufacturable at volume:\nA variety of technologies need to be perfected, including extraordinarily high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip and a tiny battery that could offer hours of power each day. Apple also needs to figure out applications that make such a device as compelling as the iPhone. And all this has to be available in large quantities at a price that won\u2019t turn off consumers.\nGiven the fact that Meta has had success in the smart glasses product category, and that AR glasses aren\u2019t around the corner, it seems quite likely that Apple will launch some form of smart glasses product in the meanwhile.\nTop comment by CarAnalogy\nIt's pretty clear that he \"cares about nothing else\" except maybe those tariffs since they are an existential threat. I really wish he would care about something else, like the software experience on all the other platforms.\nAccording to the report, Apple AR glasses are still a top priority for Tim Cook. He is \u201chell-bent\u201d on creating an \u201cindustry-leading product\u201d before Meta, and \u201ccares about nothing else.\u201d\nMeta unveiled its prototype Orion AR glasses last year. Those are still many years away from volume production, and the prototype cost is likely in the tens of thousands. Regardless, competition is fierce \u2013 and Tim Cook does not want to lose. It\u2019s the \u201conly thing he\u2019s really spending his time on,\u201d at least in terms of product development.\nMy favorite Apple accessory recommendations:\n- Anker MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand with Qi2\n- DualSense Wireless Controller for iPhone, iPad, and Mac gaming\n- MOFT Magnetic Wallet Stand, fits up to 3 cards\n- AirTag 4-pack (on sale for 20% off!)\n- Anker MagSafe/Qi2 Ultra-Slim Battery Pack\n- AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C)\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

  "argos_summary": "Apple is preparing a next\u2011generation Vision Pro headset that will likely feature an M4 or M5 chip, a lighter head strap, and an upgraded neural engine, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman. The company is also working on a cheaper, lighter Vision Pro model slated for 2027 and a pair of smart glasses with cameras and microphones expected to launch in 2026, aimed at beating Meta\u2019s Ray\u2011Bans. Gurman notes that tariffs could hinder price reductions, and Apple\u2019s focus on AI and AR is driving these hardware developments. The Vision Pro 2 will mainly be a spec bump, while the smart glasses serve as an interim product until a full AR headset is ready.",
