  "description": "Consumers and businesses will lose out, thanks to other Trump economic policies.",
  "content": "It looks as though President Trump is winning the trade wars. Deals with the European Union, Japan, Britain and many other trading partners, which went into effect on Thursday, seem heavily one-sided. The United States gets to impose tariffs on imports from other countries and they agree to drop their tariffs on some U.S. imports to zero, buy more U.S. energy and other products and commit to increasing their investments in the United States.\n\nIn the end the victory will be Pyrrhic, especially for U.S. households and businesses and for America itself, given the expected damage to its relationships with other countries and its standing in the world.\n\nThere is little clarity about the meaning of countries\u2019 agreements to invest more in the United States. Moreover, few of the deals have been signed. And Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral imposition of tariffs, usurping congressional power, faces legal challenges.\n\nHopes that the tariffs will help create jobs and bring down the U.S. trade deficit might also be hurt by other Trump policies. Many businesses, such as American automakers, may be left worse off relative to their foreign competition because they face high tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as engines and other components. And since it is far from clear that the trade deals negotiated so far will stick, the uncertainty will crimp business investment. None of this is good for job growth.",

      "text": "The trade group representing the traditional Big Three US automakers is objecting to the US agreement with Japan, saying it would be unfair to American automakers and parts suppliers.\nThe trade agreement announced Tuesday by the Trump administration would place 15% tariffs on imports from Japan, including autos and auto parts. The American automakers claim that gives Japanese imports an unfair advantage over other imported vehicles, including those assembled in Mexico and Canada by US companies with a significant number of US parts. Most imported cars \u2013 including American cars made outside the United States \u2013 face a 25% base tariff rate.\n\u201cAmerican automakers still need to review the details of the US-Japan agreement, but any deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no US content than the tariff imposed on North American built vehicles with high US content is a bad deal for US industry and US auto workers,\u201d said Matt Blunt, president of The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (parent of Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands).\nBlunt told CNN on Wednesday that the automakers have expressed their concerns about Japan\u2019s agreement with the Trump administration, just as they had when a trade framework reached with UK lowered tariffs to 10% on some luxury cars built in England, such as the Rolls Royce, Bentleys, Land Rovers, Jaguars and Aston Martins.\n\u201cWe said then, we didn\u2019t want that to become the precedent for other trade deals,\u201d he said.\nThe three automakers all referred requests for comment to AAPC.\nJapan exported 1.3 million cars to the United States last year, or about 8% of the US market, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. That\u2019s about half of the 2.5 million imported from Mexico, but just above Canada\u2019s 1.1 million.\nHowever, the Japanese automakers build most of the cars they sell in the United States in North America. Together, they built 3.3 million cars at US plants, far more than the vehicles they imported from Japanese plants.\nBut auto plants in Canada and Mexico use far more US-made parts than those built in Japan. American auto parts manufactures shipped $35.8 billion in parts to Mexico and $28.4 billion to Canada in 2024, according to Commerce Department data, but only $1.5 billion to Japan.\nAnd US car part makers employ more than 500,000 Americans, nearly twice as many workers as US auto plants, according to Labor Department data.\nJapan imports few cars itself\nThe United States, like most countries, has virtually no auto exports to Japan. Only 6% of cars sold in Japan are imports from other countries, Blunt said.\n\u201cJapan has been one of the most closed automotive markets in the world,\u201d he said.\nPresident Donald Trump posted on his Truth social media platform Wednesday that \u201cJapan is, for the first time ever, OPENING ITS MARKET TO THE USA, even to cars, SUV\u2019s, Trucks.\u201d\nBut Blunt doesn\u2019t see that happening any time soon.\n\u201cWe certainly share the president\u2019s objective of opening markets that are closed to US exports, but Japan is going to be a very tough nut to crack,\u201d he said.\nJapan does not impose tariffs on the relatively limited number of US cars it imports, but Blunt said there are a number of technical barriers. For example, Japanese certification processes differ from US specifications, there are limited dealership opportunities and Japanese car buyers prefer Japanese cars. American automakers have also greatly moved away from the small car portion of the market that is the central to Japan auto sales.\n\u201cWhen we think about markets that present real opportunities for greater US exports, I don\u2019t think Japan is often on that list,\u201d he said.\nJustin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, also questioned how many American cars the Japanese will ultimately buy.\n\u201cThe fundamental problem is if you\u2019ve ever been in Tokyo the cars are small and the roads are narrow,\u201d Wolfers said. \u201cThey don\u2019t drive American cars because they don\u2019t meet Japan\u2019s needs.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report."

However, the long-term implications may be detrimental for U.S. households and businesses, particularly in the automotive sector, where American automakers express concerns over unfair advantages given to Japanese imports. The uncertainty surrounding these trade deals and the potential legal challenges to Trump's tariff policies could hinder job growth and business investment in the U.S.",
