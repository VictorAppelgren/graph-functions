  "content": "Detroit Lions quarterback Tim Boyle (12) warms up before an NFL preseason football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Sunday, Aug. 28, 2022, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Don Wright) AP\n\nFormer Detroit Lions quarterback Tim Boyle has been waived by the Tennessee Titans after signing with the team in March.\n\nBoyle, 30, spent last year with three different teams \u2014 the Houston Texans, Miami Dolphins and New York Giants \u2014 appearing in three total games for the latter two teams and completing 54% of his throws for 276 yards and one touchdown.\n\nThe Titans are signing veteran quarterback Trevor Siemian to fill in the third quarterback spot on the roster alongside No. 1 overall pick Cameron Ward and Brandon Allen.\n\nBoyle played the final four drives of the Titans\u2019 first preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and he had a lackluster showing, completing 4-of-13 passes and getting picked off twice.\n\nThe Eastern Kentucky product went undrafted in 2018 before signing with the Green Bay Packers as a UDFA and segueing a strong preseason performance into a spot on the 53-man roster.\n\nAfter two seasons of limited play for the Packers, Boyle signed a one-year deal with the Lions in 2021. A stint on the injured list preceded Boyle getting to make his first career start in place of an injured Jared Goff in Week 11.\n\nBoyle would make three starts for the Lions, throwing for 526 yards with three touchdowns and six interceptions. Detroit lost all three of Boyle\u2019s starts.\n\nFollowing the season, Boyle signed a one-year extension with the Lions but was cut after training camp in 2022, before re-signing to the practice squad. The Chicago Bears signed Boyle off the practice squad in November 2022 and he played in one game for them.\n\nBoyle has now been with eight different teams since joining the league and will look for his next opportunity as training camp continues.",

Williams said the offer he received from the Lions was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and inked a three-year, $12 million contract.\nHe still professed his admiration for the city and his teammates even after he signed elsewhere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all love (for Detroit),\u201d Williams told reporters in New Orleans. \u201cLike, I know my teammates, everybody there at the Detroit Lions got love for me and all that. But at the same time, we couldn\u2019t come to terms, and \u2014 it\u2019s just funny, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nWhile he faced Detroit in 2023 on the Saints\u2019 roster, he hasn\u2019t returned to compete in the city since his departure.\nHis usage dropped over the last two years, getting just 48 carries in 14 games last season, ending in his release.\nFollowing the news Miami\u2019s Alexander Mattison required season-ending neck surgery, Williams appears to be a contender to join the Dolphins\u2019 running back room.\nIf the Dolphins need to get him involved quickly, it\u2019s possible he gets his feet wet for the 2025 season against his former team this week.\nLatest Detroit Lions news:\n- Ex-Lions running back\u2019s time with 49ers cut short by season-ending IR\n- \u2018Always has to one-up me\u2019: Lions kicker reacts to college teammate\u2019s 70-yard field goal\n- Former Lions journeyman quarterback waived by Titans\n- Observations: Lions\u2019 Jared Goff and first-team offense get it clicking\n- Lions reflect on QB2 competition after early turnovers opened door for one backup"

      "text": "ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions are still sorting out their backup quarterback rotation, specifically who will serve as the immediate QB2 behind starter Jared Goff.\nWhile the Hall of Fame game against the Los Angeles Chargers didn\u2019t offer many bright spots, last Friday\u2019s preseason matchup with the Atlanta Falcons provided a glimpse of hope and positive play.\n\u201cI thought Kyle (Allen) played really well, man, I was fired up. That was outstanding,\u201d coach Dan Campbell said. \u201cHe comes in the game, he wasn\u2019t going to play until the second half, and we get him in there. So it\u2019s kind of like, \u2018Hey man, you\u2019re up.\u2019 And, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to be ready to go now?\u2019 He gets out there and immediately gives us a boost. Runs the offense and makes two huge throws in the first drive he\u2019s in there.\n\u201cMan, I thought he was on point with the checks, the kills, motion landmarks, the whole thing. He operated the offense at a high level and made big-time throws, so I was fired up.\u201d\nAllen finished the game 7-of-8 passing for 120 yards and two touchdowns.\nA large portion of those yards came on a 68-yard deep shot to undrafted rookie wide receiver Jackson Meeks. Moments later, Allen connected with rookie Isaac TeSlaa for an 11-yard touchdown.\nIn the second half, on a drive largely fueled by Lions running back Jacob Saylors, Allen threw his second touchdown pass \u2014 a one-yard strike to Meeks.\nAllen entered the game late in the first half, earlier than expected. Earlier in the week, Campbell had announced that 2023 third-round pick Hendon Hooker would play the first half, with Allen taking over in the second. But Hooker, who went 7-of-10 for 38 yards, struggled to protect the football when scrambling, fumbling twice.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s preseason, so you never know when you\u2019re going to go in the game, and you just got to be ready,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing as being a backup in the regular season. You never know when your number\u2019s going to be called, so you just got to be ready.\u201d\nAfter Hooker\u2019s second fumble, Allen entered with 5:31 left in the second quarter.\n\u201cJust turning the ball over. That was the big one,\u201d Campbell said about Hooker\u2019s benching. \u201cLook, Hooker made some good throws before. He was doing a few things, but we\u2019ve got to get more work taking care of the ball.\n\u201cYou decide you\u2019re going to be a runner, you\u2019ve got to tuck it away like any runner does. Two hands on the ball in the pocket when you go to step up, so it\u2019s all the fundamentals that we talk about. So, we just need more work at that, and then he\u2019ll get to play.\u201d\nLatest Detroit Lions news:\n- Ex-Lions running back\u2019s time with 49ers cut short by season-ending IR\n- \u2018Always has to one-up me\u2019: Lions kicker reacts to college teammate\u2019s 70-yard field goal\n- Former Lions journeyman quarterback waived by Titans\n- Observations: Lions\u2019 Jared Goff and first-team offense get it clicking\n- Ex-Lions running back works out for upcoming preseason opponent, NFC North rival"

      "text": "ALLEN PARK \u2014 Even through two preseason games, the Detroit Lions are eager for the opportunity to get more reps against other NFL competition.\nThe next few times the Lions will hit the field \u2014 both in practice and in a preseason game \u2014 will be up against the Miami Dolphins.\nBeginning on Wednesday, the Lions have a pair of joint practices with the Dolphins at the team\u2019s facility before meeting in a preseason matchup on Saturday at Ford Field.\nIt will be a good chance for the Lions to get more live reps with competition outside their roster. It came together for coach Dan Campbell thanks in part to the Dolphins\u2019 nearby game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday.\n\u201cThey were going to be out there. We\u2019d already had our set up with Houston the last week, so I didn\u2019t know how much I wanted to do one before that,\u201d Campbell said Monday. \u201cI do like doing two joint weeks, if we can. They were already going to be in Chicago, so it just kind of made sense, like, all right, why don\u2019t you guys come out here and play us and then we\u2019ll get a couple of days of practice.\u201d\nCampbell knows Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, the Lions\u2019 coach being a former Dolphins assistant and interim head coach in his own right.\nGetting to go up against a high-power offense that features a lot of agility with receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and a defense that can be unpredictable can offer the Lions some valuable experience before the season.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a talented roster. They\u2019re creative on offense and they\u2019ve got a tough (defense). That\u2019s that kind of Baltimore background,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe scheme will be good. The speed on the perimeter will be really good for our guys, obviously, with what they\u2019ve got. We\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d\nUnlike the Lions\u2019 preseason games so far, this will be the first-team offense and defense\u2019s first time to face opposing players.\nCampbell hasn\u2019t used his starters \u2014 save for specialists and getting rookies Tate Ratledge and Tyleik Williams action against the Atlanta Falcons \u2014 in preseason.\nNow the starters can get that experience, but in a more controlled environment where the coaches can dictate what scenarios they want to see their key players experience against another team.\nThe Dolphins used their starters sparingly against the Bears, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and many top players on the roster playing in one drive before heading to the bench.\nIn their joint practices, we\u2019re expecting top players from the Lions to get reps against top players from the Dolphins ahead of Saturday\u2019s game.\nLatest Detroit Lions news:\n- Ex-Lions running back\u2019s time with 49ers cut short by season-ending IR\n- \u2018Always has to one-up me\u2019: Lions kicker reacts to college teammate\u2019s 70-yard field goal\n- Former Lions journeyman quarterback waived by Titans\n- Observations: Lions\u2019 Jared Goff and first-team offense get it clicking\n- Lions reflect on QB2 competition after early turnovers opened door for one backup"
