  "content": "This story was originally published by ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive its biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\nErin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather \u201cthe most credible scientists from all over the world\u201d to solve the mystery.\n\nNothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.\n\nMcCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been doing!\u201d she said to her husband, Fred.\n\nAs an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents\u2019 exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. Just three weeks earlier, she\u2019d been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.\n\nFor 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.\n\nHe remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. \u201cWe need to stop trusting the experts,\u201d he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by \u201ctrickery\u201d and researchers\u2019 self-interest.\n\nIn contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get real studies done for the first time.\u201d\n\nSome autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines. \u201cKennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,\u201d said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy \u201ccasually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.\u201d\n\nAs Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies\u2019 lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.\n\nKennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists. \u201cUnder the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cNIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic \u2014 employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.\u201d\n\nGenetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.\n\nKennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet.\n\nThe nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world\u2019s most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the \u201cheroes for the planet,\u201d he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book \u201cClimate in Crisis\u201d that 33 years\u2019 worth of his work was \u201creduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.\u201d\n\nBut recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s aware of my work,\u201d McCanlies said, \u201cor most of the literature that\u2019s been published on what the causes of autism are.\u201d\n\nMcCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.\n\nIt was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids\u2019 developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?\n\nThe questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups\u2019 chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.\n\nHertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother\u2019s fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.\n\nMcCanlies hadn\u2019t studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world\u2019s experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.\n\nTheir first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto\u2019s data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.\n\nThe sample size was small \u2014 just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.\n\nMcCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)\n\nTheir third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism. Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.\n\nResearchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certain pesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes \u201cautism-like behavioral changes\u201d in mice. In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking \u201cforever chemicals\u201d called PFOA and PFNA with the condition. (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA.) Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.\n\nTogether, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.\n\nAt least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt \u2014 and funded by the NIEHS and NIH \u2014 found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.\n\nOne problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz\u2013Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.\n\nIn 2023, they set about finding out.\n\nThey were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America\u2019s health.\n\nDespite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiple studies have linked to autism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won\u2019t legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism. It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditions contributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.\n\nThe EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions. Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was \u201cno longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.\u201d After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge\u2019s ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.\n\nSchmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. \u201cMillions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency\u2019s cuts to getting rid of \u201cunhealthy fat,\u201d but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists. Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.\n\nThe reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that \u201ccritical programs will continue.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy\u2019s watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump\u2019s \u201canti-woke\u201d priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms. Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men\u2019s exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism. (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated.) A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,\u201d said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. \u201cTo take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.\u201d\n\nHoused under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy\u2019s new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find \u201cpossible contributors to the causes of autism\u201d as well as conduct research on existing treatments.\n\nWith the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have \u201csome initial indicator answers\u201d about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.\n\nWhile the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds. HHS did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals \u201cdo not follow the traditional NIH review process.\u201d According to the video, the process was \u201cdesigned to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.\u201d\n\nHertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is \u201cshutting down good studies,\u201d is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. \u201cSome of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if something good can be done with this money, I\u2019d like to be part of that.\u201d\n\nIf her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.\n\nMcCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him at all,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy \u2014 or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump\u2019s Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn\u2019t respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a \u201chigher productivity\u201d job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.\n\nThe 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn\u2019t been ready to leave NIOSH\u2019s Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.\n\nMcCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab\u2019s hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.\n\nShe felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents\u2019 exposure to plastics was \u201cconsistently and significantly associated\u201d with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in \u201caberrant behaviors\u201d and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.\n\nThe paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies \u201cconsider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.\u201d\n\nHaving just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.",

  "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, has shut down research into the environmental causes of autism by eliminating an entire division from his division. This comes after Kennedy promised to gather \"the most credible scientists from all over the world\" to solve the mystery of autism's increase in severity. He has also overseen massive cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including environmental causes. Critics argue that he lacks transparency and ignores decades of high quality research. Kennedy has defended the theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence suggesting otherwise. He also supports the Trump administration's efforts to dismiss federal employees with experience studying environmental threats and roll back environmental protections linked to autism.",

A related goal is to determine whether susceptibility to autoimmune disease increases the neurotoxicity of environmental contaminants and increases the risk for developing disorders such as autism. Understanding how exposure to environmental toxicants may contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders is important so that the exposure risks can be identified and minimized. If immune system dysfunction is found to increase the risk of exposure to environmental toxicants, then exposure limits to toxic substances can be lowered, and children with immune system dysfunction who may be at increase risk can be identified and protected.\nThere are two major hypotheses in Project 3. Each will be tested in mice as models of the human condition. The first hypothesis is: Developmental neurotoxicity will be greater in mice susceptible to autoimmunity. The second hypothesis is: Developmental exposure of C57BL/6J and SJL/J mice to methylmercury (MeHg), a non-coplanar polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) or a polybrominated diphenyl ether BDE will alter immune system function, with greater effects predicted in autoimmune-susceptible SJL/J mice. The objectives are to expose mouse strains with low (C57BL/6J) or high (SJL mice) susceptibility to autoimmunity perinatally to each of these environmental toxicants of concern to childrens health. We will compare the effects of toxicant exposure between these mouse strains on brain development, complex social behaviors, and immune system function. The overriding hypothesis is that perinatal exposure to each of these toxic substances will impair brain development and behavior, and that suscepbility to autoimmune disease will increase the neuro- and immunotoxicity of these agents. We will also explore a potentially new model of autism in mice injected prenatally with unique autoantibodies isolated from the serum of mothers who have given birth to two more more autistic children. Brain development will be examined histologically using stereological procedures and immunohistochemistry. Complex social behaviors will be studied using behavioral testing procedures established in our laboratory that measure social recognition, social interaction and social communication in mice. Immune system status will be established by measuring cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, and quantifying immune system response to antigenic stimulation. In addition, seizure susceptibility will be measured in toxicant-exposed mice as well as measures of synaptic excitibility and plasticity in hippocampal brain slices. These studies will provide critical new information on the role of the immune system and its interaction with environmental contaminants in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\nApproach:\nProject 3 addresses the need to develop mouse models that can directly test specific hypotheses about how abnormal immune systems impact neurodevelopmental outcomes, especially those relevant to autism including social behaviors and susceptibility to seizure disorders. First and foremost, the mouse models we have chosen will permit direct analysis of measures of altered immune parameters in parallel with measures of neurobehavioral outcomes. Second, we will compare how exposures to known developmental toxicants influence the immune and nervous systems in mouse strains susceptible (SJL/J) and non-susceptible (C57BL/6J) to autoimmunity. Third, analysis of immunological and neurodevelopmental profiles measured in control mice and mice exposed perinatally to known immunological and neurodevelopmental toxicants will be compared to immunological profiles and cellular responses measured from peripheral blood samples obtained from children with and without autism who enroll in the CHARGE-BACK study. Fourth, we will test if prenatal exposure to purified IgG containing autoantibodies directed at fetal brain protein (AA-IgG) isolated from the serum of mothers of autistic children will alter brain development, behavior, and susceptibility to MeHg.\nExpected Results:\nThe experimental approach we propose in Project 3 addresses a major goal of CCEH investigators; to better understand how immune cells from autistic children respond differently to environmental triggers, to elucidate their underlying mechanisms, and to understand their impact on brain development and behavior through the use of relevant animal models.\nSupplemental Keywords:\nautism, genes, environment, mercury, PCBs, PBDEs, immune, autoimmune, neurodevelopment, developmental neurotoxicity, persistent organic pollutants, CHARGE, MARBLES,, Health, Scientific Discipline, Health Risk Assessment, Risk Assessments, Epidemiology, Genetics, autism, genetic analysis, susceptibility, children's health, developmental effects, developmental neurotoxicologyProgress and Final Reports:\nMain Center Abstract and Reports:\nR833292 UC Davis Center for Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Subprojects under this Center: (EPA does not fund or establish subprojects; EPA awards and manages the overall grant for this center).\nR833292C001 PROJECT 1: Environmental Epidemiology of Autism\nR833292C002 PROJECT 2: Immunological Susceptibility in Autism\nR833292C003 PROJECT 3: Models of Neurosusceptibility\nThe perspectives, information and conclusions conveyed in research project abstracts, progress reports, final reports, journal abstracts and journal publications convey the viewpoints of the principal investigator and may not represent the views and policies of ORD and EPA.

      "text": "Reporting Highlights\n- Slashed Autism Funding: RFK Jr. promised to identify the causes of autism but has eliminated parts of his agency actively investigating them and has cut millions in funding for autism research.\n- Silent on Rollbacks: Once an ardent environmentalist who took on big polluters, RFK Jr. has been silent on Trump\u2019s dismantling of efforts to combat climate change and pollution.\n- Conflicting Priorities: RFK Jr. helps lead an administration that is reversing regulations on pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\nErin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather \u201cthe most credible scientists from all over the world\u201d to solve the mystery.\nNothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.\nMcCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been doing!\u201d she said to her husband, Fred.\nAs an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents\u2019 exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. Just three weeks earlier, she\u2019d been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.\nFor 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.\nHe remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. \u201cWe need to stop trusting the experts,\u201d he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by \u201ctrickery\u201d and researchers\u2019 self-interest.\nIn contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get real studies done for the first time.\u201d\nSome autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines. \u201cKennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,\u201d said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy \u201ccasually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.\u201d\nAs Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies\u2019 lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.\nKennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists. \u201cUnder the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cNIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic \u2014 employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.\u201d\nGenetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.\nKennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet.\nThe nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world\u2019s most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the \u201cheroes for the planet,\u201d he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book \u201cClimate in Crisis\u201d that 33 years\u2019 worth of his work was \u201creduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.\u201d\nBut recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s aware of my work,\u201d McCanlies said, \u201cor most of the literature that\u2019s been published on what the causes of autism are.\u201d\nMcCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.\nIt was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids\u2019 developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?\nThe questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups\u2019 chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.\nHertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother\u2019s fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.\nMcCanlies hadn\u2019t studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world\u2019s experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.\nTheir first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto\u2019s data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.\nThe sample size was small \u2014 just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.\nMcCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)\nTheir third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism. Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.\nResearchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certain pesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes \u201cautism-like behavioral changes\u201d in mice. In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking \u201cforever chemicals\u201d called PFOA and PFNA with the condition. (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA.) Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.\nTogether, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.\nAt least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt \u2014 and funded by the NIEHS and NIH \u2014 found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.\nOne problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz\u2013Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.\nIn 2023, they set about finding out.\nThey were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America\u2019s health.\nDespite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiple studies have linked to autism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won\u2019t legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism. It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditions contributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.\nThe EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions. Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was \u201cno longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.\u201d After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge\u2019s ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.\nSchmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. \u201cMillions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency\u2019s cuts to getting rid of \u201cunhealthy fat,\u201d but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists. Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.\nThe reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that \u201ccritical programs will continue.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy\u2019s watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump\u2019s \u201canti-woke\u201d priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms. Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men\u2019s exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism. (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated.) A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,\u201d said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. \u201cTo take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.\u201d\nHoused under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy\u2019s new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find \u201cpossible contributors to the causes of autism\u201d as well as conduct research on existing treatments.\nWith the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have \u201csome initial indicator answers\u201d about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.\nWhile the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds. HHS did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals \u201cdo not follow the traditional NIH review process.\u201d According to the video, the process was \u201cdesigned to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.\u201d\nHertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is \u201cshutting down good studies,\u201d is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. \u201cSome of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if something good can be done with this money, I\u2019d like to be part of that.\u201d\nIf her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.\nMcCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him at all,\u201d she said.\nMcCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy \u2014 or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump\u2019s Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn\u2019t respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a \u201chigher productivity\u201d job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.\nThe 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn\u2019t been ready to leave NIOSH\u2019s Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.\nMcCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab\u2019s hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.\nShe felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents\u2019 exposure to plastics was \u201cconsistently and significantly associated\u201d with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in \u201caberrant behaviors\u201d and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.\nThe paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies \u201cconsider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.\u201d\nHaving just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.\nMariam Elba contributed research."

Methods: We used data from the Study to Explore Early Development to evaluate the association between proximity of residence at birth to major roadways, PM2.5, and odds of ASD. Analyses included 674 cases of children with confirmed ASD and 855 population controls. We assessed associations with roadway proximity, as a marker of traffic-related air pollution, and PM2.5 during the entire pregnancy and first year of life. To characterize neighborhood deprivation, a weighted index was created, based on eight census tract level socioeconomic status-related parameters obtained from the US census. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the associations between roadway proximity, PM2.5, and ASD. Results: We observed modification by neighborhood deprivation for the association between PM2.5 exposure during the first year of life and ASD, with the strongest associations observed for those living in high neighborhood deprivation (odds ratio=2.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.20, 4.86). Conclusions: These results provide suggestive evidence of interaction between neighborhood deprivation and PM2.5 exposure during the first year of life in association with childhood ASD.

      "text": "Welcome\nThe Coalition of Autism Scientists formed in 2025 in reaction to U.S. Department for Health and Human Services' actions to dismiss decades of autism research and establish questionable research protocols without input from the autism community. The Coalition is comprised of the leading autism researchers from across the United States who advocate for high quality, transparent, and collaborative research approaches that inform the global understanding of autism. The Coalition will publicly refute misinformation about autism and monitor progress by the federal government in supporting the highest quality research that addresses the priority needs of the autism community.\nStatement on Concerns Related to NIH Approach\nto Funding Autism Research\nJune 10, 2025 -- On May 27, 2025, the National Institutes of Health announced the Autism Data Science Initiative (ADSI) and opened a request for proposals with plans to award $50 million, purportedly to boost research on identifying the causes of autism. While the amount available for this ADSI is significant, representing more than 10 percent of the annual budget for autism research1, the Coalition of Autism Scientists has serious concerns about the primary focus on data mining of existing datasets and the process for selecting proposals for funding, all while drastically eliminating ongoing investigator-initiated grants and gutting the NIH budget for future research.\n\u201cThe ADSI needs to be understood in the context of the Secretary of Health and Human Services\u2019 recent, bold statements about the department\u2019s intention to find \u2018the causes of autism by September,\u2019 which casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight of U.S. public health and research initiatives,\u201d said Helen Tager-Flusberg, PhD, Boston University and founder of the Coalition of Autism Scientists. \u201cWhile the ADSI invites applicants to embrace an open science framework by registering their research plans and sharing their data and models, which are accepted scientific practices, it lacks transparency in the awarding and execution of the research to be conducted.\u201d\nADSI Framework Evades Best Science Practices\nIn addition to registering research plans, the ADSI also calls for applications to validate and replicate initial findings, which is appropriate. However, what concerns the Coalition of Autism Scientists is the unusual \u2018Other Transactions\u2019 mechanism that the ADSI uses, which is unlike the standard NIH grant or contract mechanisms.\nLisa A. Croen, PhD, Senior Research Scientist, Director, Autism Research Program, Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and member of the Coalition of Autism Scientists Executive Committee explained, \u201cUnder the \u2018other transactions\u2019 agreement, NIH staff will be involved in the grant review process itself and have far greater involvement in the execution of the funded projects than is standard.\u201d This high degree of involvement undermines the independence of the peer-review process as well as the role of the investigators whose proposals are selected for funding.\nDavid G. Amaral, PhD, UC Davis Distinguished Professor, The M.I.N.D. Institute, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Director, Autism BrainNet, and member of the Coalition of Autism Scientists Executive Committee added, \u201cAnother concerning issue is the rapidity with which the process from announcement to the application submission deadline is taking place, allowing just one month for applicants to pull together a large-scale, collaborative scientific proposal.\u201d\nPrioritize External Review to Build Trust\nThe open science framework proposed for ADSI should be complemented with an open review process that publicizes the names and credentials of the reviewers who will evaluate submitted proposals, shares which applications are selected for funding, and provides details on the terms and conditions for the awards. For that reason, the Coalition of Autism Scientists calls for an independent external advisory board of autism scientists and community members to support the ADSI, which will facilitate earning the trust of researchers and the public.\nAutism Scientists Concerned About Future Research Support\nDespite this planned infusion of money to advance autism science, the autism research community has grave concerns about the current and future landscape for the field. In a survey conducted last month with over 100 members of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, 98 percent worried that they would have difficulty obtaining new grants to support their research and 85 percent expressed fears that they might lose their current funding.\nWhy are researchers so apprehensive about the administration\u2019s stated commitment to advancing the science of autism? Responders to the survey cited several reasons, including plans to drastically reduce the budget for NIH, the sudden expiration of all NIH funding opportunities for autism research, the termination of existing grants, and changes in NIH priorities for future funding.\nAlready, Reuters reported that in the first 4 months of this year NIH funding for autism research was down by $31 million, from $147 million to $116 million, with cuts to institutions, grants that focused on women or diversity topics, and training grants, particularly those targeting underrepresented minorities.2 Funding for subcontracts to institutions outside the United States have also been eliminated. The future is looking bleak as proposed budget cuts to NIH, NSF and the CDC and the elimination of the Department of Defense Autism Research Program will drastically curtail funding for most autism research.\nThe current concerns of the autism research community could be assuaged if federal funding levels for autism research are fully restored and commitments are made to award new investigator-initiated grants in areas outside ADSI.\nReferences\n-\nFigures based on recent figures from the federal Inter-Agency Autism Coordinating Committee.

And I am fabulous because of it.\nYsabel, a late diagnosed autistic woman\nIt\u2019s important to celebrate autistic strengths, and not solely focus on the challenges autistic people might face. Some autistic people who experience a high level of disability may struggle to see their strengths, but neurodiversity is a collective strength, regardless of an individual's abilities.\nEach autistic person is different, just like how all non-autistic people are different. We\u2019ve listed some examples of strengths that are common in autistic people, but it doesn\u2019t mean every autistic person will excel in every one of these areas.\n10 examples of autistic strengths\n1. Expertise in their favourite topics\nSome autistic people have developed deep expertise in topics that interest them, which some people call special interests. There is a huge variety in these topics, which can range from astrophysics to vintage clothing and everything in between.\nMy special interest has been a way for me to succeed in education and my career, even when the social and psychological odds were stacked against me from the start.\nLauren, an autistic therapist and PhD researcher\n2. Hyperfocus\nMany autistic people experience periods of intense focus on something that interests them, known as hyperfocus. When they are engaged in something, some autistic people can experience a flow state, where everything else disappears apart from the task they are focusing on.\nMy autistic strength is hyperfocus. I get through way more work than my colleagues and it\u2019s always accurate and of excellent quality.\nGill, autistic adult\n3. A strong sense of justice\nMany autistic people are highly empathetic and have a strong moral compass. They may become distressed by injustice and motivated to change the world for the better. Plenty of autistic people are not afraid to stand up for their beliefs and challenge things they see as unjust.\nI have a strong sense of justice and will fight and be vocal for what I think is right.\nShardae, an autistic adult\n4. Creativity\nThere are lots of creative autistic people. Many autistic people pursue careers in the arts, such as becoming a musician or a visual artist.\nI enjoy being creative: it not only brings me joy, it's a useful tool in all parts of life.\nJimi, an autistic adult\n5. Attention to detail\nMany autistic people are observant and have excellent attention to detail. This can serve them well in professional settings and day-to-day life.\nI tend to have such high attention to detail, which as an artist, helps me to create many wonderful artworks.\nDylan, an autistic adult\n6. Honesty\nAutistic people can have excellent character strengths, including honesty. Honesty fosters trust and credibility, which are crucial in personal and professional relationships. It also promotes integrity, when someone is consistent between one's words and actions.\nI feel like due to my autism I am probably the most trustworthy, honest and loyal person anyone could ever meet, I genuinely feel this is because: 1. I have a strong sense of justice which means I struggle to lie even if it\u2019s for my benefit. It also means if I do something wrong I hold myself accountable. 2. I have to have everything fair and equal. These traits occasionally do go against me though!\nDani - an adult who happens to be autistic\n7. Loyalty\nAutistic people are often very loyal. Whether that's to friends, family, or even their employer...\nI\u2019m fiercely loyal. Once I let you into my heart, you can trust me implicitly.\nEmma , an autistic adult\n8. Creative problem solving\nMany autistic people are excellent problem solvers and can come up with creative solutions with their great pattern recognition.\nOne of my autistic child\u2019s strengths is his uncanny ability to figure out solutions to problems that are amazingly creative, inventive, and often downright ingenious.\nBethel, parent of an autistic teenager\n9. Less influenced by socially-derived biases\nResearch suggests autistic people are less likely to be influenced by prejudices driven by societal norms and beliefs.\u00b9\nA great strength of autism can be seeing the world in a different way, questioning and breaking norms which others blindly follow.\nNick\n10. Excellent memory\nMany autistic people talk about their excellent recall ability and how well they can remember details.\nMy memory. I retain ridiculous and usually pointless details and facts. It's usually a strength and I love it when people are amazed by the cool memory game and challenges I show them. But sometimes it's a weakness too, because when something awful and traumatic happens, I wish I didn't remember it so vividly\nJosh - a trans male autistic adult\nAre you autistic, or do you have an autistic family member? Join the Autistica Network to get involved in research and use your autistic strengths to help others!\nWhen we asked members of the Autistica Network for quotes, we let people to choose how we would like to refer to them. There may be examples of both person-first and identity-first language to reflect people's individual preferences.\nReferences\n[1] Rozenkrantz, L. et al (2021) Enhanced Rationality in ASD."

      "text": "Under pressure, HHS reinstates hundreds of occupational health workers\nAfter facing considerable pushback from labor organizations and congressional lawmakers, the Trump administration has reversed course on some of its planned layoffs at the federal health agency responsible for overseeing workplace safety.\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, was slated to lose at least 900 workers, which represents more than 90% of the entire agency workforce.\nBut a federal lawsuit brought by a coal miner and a push among some members of Congress \u2014 including Republicans from West Virginia \u2014 appear to have prompted the Department of Health and Human Services to reinstate some critical programs.\nAltogether 328 employees at NIOSH were reinstated, according to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr., who was questioned about the layoffs during a congressional hearing on Wednesday.\nWhile he didn't provide many details, Kennedy did say the rehired workers were based at NIOSH facilities in Morgantown, W.Va., and Cincinnati, as well as at the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides services to first responders and survivors of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\nDeep cuts to NIOSH remain\n\"I welcome the return of some NIOSH scientists, but this isn't the NIOSH that all American workers need,\" said Dr. Robert Harrison, who directs the Occupational Health Program at the University of California San Francisco.\nHe said the cuts continue to jeopardize the agency's mission to keep workers in many other industries safe \u2014 from construction and agriculture to warehouses and restaurants.\n\"All of these workers need the advice and protections that NIOSH gives,\" he says.\nAmong the people being brought back are staff involved with investigating workplace hazards like cancer clusters, testing and certifying personal protective equipment and addressing respiratory health in coal miners and other workers, according to interviews with several NIOSH employees and an internal email from the agency's director.\n\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not,\" wrote NIOSH director John Howard in an email to staff on Tuesday. \"I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH.\"\nHoward was first appointed to the top post at the institute during the George W. Bush administration and later re-appointed by President Barack Obama.\nRFK Jr. faces criticism on Capitol Hill\nThe move to bring back some NIOSH employees came on the eve of Kennedy's Wednesday appearance in front of two congressional committees on his department's proposed 2026 budget.\nIn both hearings, Kennedy was grilled about the rationale for eliminating much of the federal agency, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn one exchange, Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, asked Kennedy why the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer had stopped enrollment, which is clearly stated on the federal website.\n\"I don't know about that,\" Kennedy answered.\nIn response to questioning from Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper on the loss of staff in his state of Colorado and elsewhere in the West who were focused on the health risks for firefighters, Kennedy pointed to the need to reduce the federal debt and said that \"a lot of the cuts that we're implementing now are painful.\"\nAfter employees were notified in April that they would lose their jobs, the Trump administration maintained that critical services would remain intact and be streamlined as a part of the new agency within HHS being created by Kennedy.\nBut people at NIOSH told NPR that key functions had come to a standstill because of the huge disruptions. And even with the reversal of some cuts, many others involved in studying and preventing toxic chemicals and workplace hazards are still slated to be laid off.\nFor example, more than 140 employees in Spokane, Wash., and Pittsburgh who work on mining safety and research \u2014 everything from preventing mine explosions to machine accidents \u2014 are being cut.\n\"While I'm extremely happy to return to my job with the [National Firefighter Registry for Cancer] team, the union is determined to continue to advocate for full reinstatement of all NIOSH employees. All NIOSH programs are important for the health and safety of working people in this country,\" said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, representing employees at NIOSH in Cincinnati."

      "text": "Abstract\nEvidence of air pollution exposure, namely, ambient particulate matter (PM), during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in children is growing; however, the unique PM sources that contribute to this association are currently unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate local, source-specific ambient PM exposure during pregnancy and its associations with childhood autism, specifically, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as a group. A cohort of 40,245 singleton births from 2000 to 2009 in Scania, Sweden, was combined with data on locally emitted PM with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5). A flat, two-dimensional dispersion model was used to assess local PM2.5 concentrations (all-source PM2.5, small-scale residential heating- mainly wood burning, tailpipe exhaust, and vehicle wear-and-tear) at the mother\u2019s residential address during pregnancy. Associations were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Exposure to local PM2.5 during pregnancy from each of the investigated sources was associated with childhood autism in the fully adjusted models. For ASD, similar, but less pronounced, associations were found. The results add to existing evidence that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of childhood autism. Further, these findings suggest that locally produced emissions from both residential wood burning and road traffic-related sources (tailpipe exhaust and vehicle wear-and-tear) contribute to this association.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nAir pollution is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) derived from fossil fuels alone has recently been estimated to contribute to 10.2 million premature deaths around the world each year2. The relationship between traffic-related air pollution, often tailpipe emissions stemming from diesel fuel and petrol combustion, and adverse health effects is well established3,4,5. Additionally, vehicle wear-and-tear\u2019s finer fractions contribute to inhalable PM pollution6. Wood burning for residential heating and leisure purposes also produces PM as well as other toxic compounds7,8,9, yet little is known about the health effects of ambient wood smoke.\nEvolving evidence indicates that health effects may vary in type and degree depending on the source of PM2.5 exposure10. Source-specific epidemiological studies are still scarce, though, as such separation requires high quality exposure data that has not been available previously. Air pollution is far from static and varies substantially in time and space, which means that advanced exposure assessment is needed to better capture local exposures\u2019 unique composition. With this, the health effects of distinct sources, rather than total concentrations, can be investigated. For instance, associations between tailpipe exhaust particles and low birth weight have been observed in a Swedish study using advanced source-specific exposure data11. Associations between ambient wood smoke, and their related markers, and both dementia12 and childhood asthma13 have also been found in other Sweden-based studies using advanced exposure assessment data.\nWhile all people are susceptible to the adverse health effects of air pollution, pregnant women and their developing fetuses may be particularly vulnerable14,15. Thus, air pollution exposure during pregnancy and in early life has been studied in connection to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Evidence of this association has been developing, with a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the association but emphasizing cautious interpretation due to the relatively small sample of available studies16. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis including both adults and children has demonstrated more robust associations, naming ASD among other neurological and developmental disorders associated with PM2.5 exposure17. More current systematic reviews and meta-analyses focusing on children only and prenatal exposure specifically identified the strongest evidence for PM2.5 exposure and ASD18,19, with one reporting each 5 \u00b5g/m3 incremental increase in PM2.5 to lead to a 5%, 7%, or 15% increased risk of ASD in newborns depending on the model used19. Similarly, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis examining vulnerable exposure windows, including prenatal periods (first trimester, third trimester and entire pregnancy), first year after birth, and second year after birth, also reported an association between PM2.5 and ASD, and the authors named early postnatal periods as critical exposure windows20. Some disagreement exists, however, as another review found the pregnancy period to be the most impactful PM2.5 exposure window for ASD21.\nAutism development is poorly understood, but mounting evidence has emphasized the importance of genetic and environmental factors22. With the latter being modifiable, research on the role of the environment, particularly air pollution, has increased. Suggested biological mechanisms include oxidative stress, inflammation (neuro-inflammation and systemic inflammation), neurotoxicity, and endocrine disruption23,24,25,26. Animal models also support developmental neurotoxicity as a plausible pathway27,28, and one such study has demonstrated ASD traits in mice following prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust29. A recent study of maternal serum samples indicated that high exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy disturbed metabolic pathways and mitochondrial function among mothers with children that developed ASD30. Moreover, short- and long-term species of PM2.5 that can be traced to wood burning have been shown to negatively affect several metabolic pathways involved in oxidative stress and inflammation31.\nAlthough air pollution has been demonstrated to significantly affect neurodevelopment and contribute to autism18,19, only one study could be identified considering these associations with respect to source-specific exposure (tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions from road traffic)32. As the sources of locally produced air pollution may vary from setting to setting and each source can have unique effects on human health, previous research has encouraged more source-apportionment studies of PM33. Road traffic is often one of the largest contributors to PM emissions and is predicted to increase19, therefore, exploring the various sources of traffic-related PM can provide a better understanding of their individual impacts on public health. Additionally, too few epidemiological studies investigating ambient wood smoke from residential wood combustion and health exist to date34, and none consider autism. Indeed, a review on the health impacts of wood burning emissions cited the need for more studies on non-respiratory pediatric outcomes, with better exposure assessment and proper adjustment for confounding35. The knowledge gleaned from source-specific findings can be used to inform air quality policy on all potentially detrimental emission sources.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the association between exposure to source-specific ambient PM2.5 during pregnancy and autism in children within a low-exposure setting where air pollution concentrations generally comply with the current European air quality guidelines36.\nMethods\nStudy setting and study population\nThis study was undertaken in Scania (Sk\u00e5ne), the southernmost county in Sweden, which had a total population of approximately 1.4 million at the end of 2019. The study population is comprised of the Maternal Air Pollution in Southern Sweden (MAPSS) cohort, containing data on 43,256 singleton births from 2000 to 2009 in Scania. A detailed description of this cohort has been provided previously by Malmqvist et al.37. In short, MAPSS utilizes a high-quality local birth register with 98% coverage of all births in Scania and includes important data on the women\u2019s obstetric history, risk factors, and other relevant covariates. The birth register, Perinatal Revision Syd (PRS), has a wide catchment area of hospitals in Malm\u00f6, Lund, and Trelleborg.\nUsing each woman\u2019s unique personal identification number, PRS was linked to air pollution concentrations at her residential address as well as to additional demographic information and socioeconomic characteristics obtained from Statistics Sweden. This data combined constitutes MAPSS. When excluding children with missing exposure or incorrect data linkage, the final study size was 40,245 (Fig. 1).\nExposure assessment\nA Gaussian plume air dispersion model was used to model the dispersion of emissions throughout Scania, Sweden, during the study period38. This flat, two-dimensional dispersion model is a locally adjusted version of the American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency39 and was implemented in the ENVIMAN software package. Total PM2.5 concentrations were modelled at a 100 m by 100 m spatial resolution and a standard, hourly temporal resolution, which was then aggregated into yearly concentrations to derive annual mean concentrations. Source-specific PM2.5 concentrations were based on dispersion calculations utilizing statistical weather data, which consisted of 360 different conditions. These were derived from monitored weather conditions over a long period. The software calculated dispersion for each PM2.5 source according to each of the 360 conditions, multiplied the result for each case with the frequency in which the condition occurred during the monitored period, and summed these to obtain an annual mean concentration. Because modelling each individual 100-m grid-square throughout the entire study area (11,303 km2) and for the whole study period (12 years) is both resource- and time-intensive, the dispersion calculation was only carried out for the start and end years (2000 and 2011) of the study period. The interpolation of the years between them was based on an atmospheric ventilation index using a complex method developed by the Swedish Clean Air and Climate Research Program. To derive monthly values, further interpolation was performed and is described in Rittner et al.38. During this process, month- and year-specific temporal and meteorological variations in air pollution were addressed. The model was evaluated against measured monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations, aggregated from hourly or daily averages, from three monitoring stations in Malm\u00f6, Trelleborg and Landskrona (along the west and southwest coast of Scania). Correlations (Pearson R2) between modelled and measured PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 0.44 to 0.86, with the highest correlation seen in the southwest part of Scania where Malm\u00f6, the largest city in Scania, is located38. Mean bias of the PM2.5 model was negative and positive spanning: \u2212 8.99 to 4.59 \u00b5g/m3, which does not indicate the presence of systematic modelling error in any specific direction38. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the three monitoring stations ranged between 1.50 and 9.3338.\nEmission data for this dispersion model was obtained from a detailed database of local emission sources maintained by the City of Malm\u00f6\u2019s Environmental Department. These included aviation, industries, major energy and heat producers, railroads, road traffic, shipping, small-scale residential heating, non-road vehicles, and emissions from Zealand, Denmark. Aviation emission data from regional airports and Kastrup (Copenhagen, Denmark) were obtained from the airports\u2019 annual environmental reports. Industry and energy production emissions were reported by relevant entities within the study area. Railroads in Sweden are mainly electric; therefore, railroad emissions were estimated using the fuel consumption of the few operational diesel engine freight trains in Scania while in transit on railway lines and while static at railway stations37. To account for emissions from road traffic, data on fuel sources (petrol, diesel, and compressed natural gas), types of vehicles (passenger cars, light-goods vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles), traffic volume, and speed limits were known for each road segment (classified into one of 36 distinct road types in an urban or rural environment) in the study area. This data was gathered from the Swedish Road Administration and local municipalities. Emission factors developed by the Handbook of Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA), version 3.240 were then applied to this data to estimate local traffic exhaust emissions. Emissions from vehicle wear-and-tear, or the abrasive emissions from road traffic, included re-suspended road dust, tire-wear and brake-wear particles according to the emission model detailed in HBEFA 3.240. Originally, only the re-suspension of PM10 particles was included in the emission database. To include PM2.5, it was estimated that only 20% of PM10 particles were less than 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter (i.e., PM2.5 equals 0.2 of PM10)38. The suspension of road dust and tire-wear during wintertime was also based on research analyzing particulate emissions from studded tires in Stockholm, Sweden. These were then applied to the Scanian setting according to an estimate of the percentage of vehicles with studded tires (35% in 2000 and 25% in 201138). Shipping emissions from around Scania\u2019s coast were estimated by Gustafsson39 for the year 2000, and 2011 emissions were described by Project Shipair41. Regarding small-scale residential heating, the frequency of, for example, fireplace- and/or wood stove-use in Scania was estimated using detailed chimney sweeping records39. Emissions from non-road vehicles throughout the study area were derived from a report by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute, IVL. Scania\u2019s proximity to the industrial island of Zealand and the area\u2019s prevailing westerly winds warranted the inclusion of their local emissions in the dispersion model38.\nThe geographical coordinates of each woman\u2019s residential address were obtained from Statistics Sweden, linked to MAPSS, and used to calculate individual exposure. Statistics Sweden only updates changes in residency at the end of the calendar year. Exposure estimates for every gestational month were, therefore, based on the nearest available time: January\u2013June coordinates from the end of the previous year and July\u2013December coordinates from the end of the current year. Moreover, if 67% or more of monthly exposure data was non-missing, the pregnancy exposure overall was designated as non-missing. This cut-off was chosen following an evaluation of monthly exposures for pregnancies with complete exposure data. For pregnancies where > 67% of the monthly exposure data was missing, all missing values were replaced with an estimated value based on exposure from subsequent years using the Expectation\u2013Maximization algorithm.\nBecause this study examined locally emitted PM2.5, regional background concentrations (often referred to as \u201clong-range\u201d or \u201cin-transported\u201d) were not considered. As regional background emissions typically comprise the majority of total PM, investigating only local PM concentrations results in seemingly low exposure levels. However, the spatial contrast of regional background concentrations is low in this study area38. Because of this, effect estimates would still describe contrasts in local exposures even if regional background concentrations were included. The interpretation of the estimates becomes somewhat different, though: it illustrates the effect of local contrasts rather than the aggregate effect of total PM, which is more traditionally studied.\nFour sources of locally emitted PM2.5 were investigated: all-source PM2.5, small-scale residential heating, tailpipe exhaust, and vehicle wear-and-tear. Small-scale residential heating mainly consists of wood burning in household fireplaces and/or wood stoves for heating or leisure, and vehicle wear-and-tear comprises the air pollution generated from re-suspended road dust and vehicles\u2019 brakes and tires (Fig. 2). All other source contributions (aviation, industries, major energy and heat producers, railroads, shipping, non-road vehicles, etc.) were very small. Therefore, these were not examined separately but were captured by the aggregated all-source PM2.5 category, which also included small-scale residential heating, tailpipe exhaust, and vehicle wear-and-tear. The distribution of these exposure variables can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S1 (Supplementary Information).\nOutcome assessment\nThe outcome of interest in this study was autism, specifically ASD [International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders version 10 (ICD-10) diagnosis codes starting with F84] and childhood autism (ICD-10 diagnosis code F84.0) only. ASD comprises all pervasive developmental disorders. It is characterized by one or more of the following areas of neurodivergence: qualitative variations in patterns of communication; difficulties with reciprocal social interactions; and a restricted, repetitive collection of behaviors and interests. For childhood autism, symptoms within all three areas of neurodivergence must be present before the age of 3 years.\nWhen a child is suspected of having autism in Scania, they are referred to the Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and are examined by a multidisciplinary team42. These evaluations utilize both the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G)43 and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)44 for most (75%) cases. Diagnostic methods for the remaining cases can differ. On occasion, structured instruments other than ADOS and ADI, such as the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid), the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS), the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition (SRS-2), the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), or the Nordic Questionnaire for Evaluation of Development and Behavior in Children and Adolescents called Five-to-Fifteen (5\u201315 or FTF), are used to varying degrees and in varying combinations. In all cases, however, the child\u2019s behavior is observed, the parents are interviewed, and information is gathered from the child\u2019s school. All data is then evaluated and compared to diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Finally, an autism diagnosis is assigned according to the ICD-10 and entered into the Sk\u00e5ne Healthcare Database (SHR). The outcome data used in this study was extracted from SHR and was available through the 31st of December, 2017.\nCovariates\nThe risk factors for autism development, identified a priori, considered for this study were maternal age (\u2264 19, 20\u201334, \u2265 35), parity (1, 2, 3, or \u2265 4), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI; < 18.5, 18.5\u201324.9, 25\u201329.9, \u2265 30 kg/m2), smoking status at first antenatal visit (non-smoker, 1\u20139 cigarettes/day, \u2265 10 cigarettes/day), as well as sex of the child (male/female) and birth year (categorical; 2000\u20132009). Socioeconomic status (SES) predictors were also incorporated to control for potential confounding. These included maternal birth country (Sweden, Europe, other), maternal education (\u2264 9, 10\u201312, 13\u201316, and > 16 years of schooling), annual household disposable income (quartiles), and neighborhood-level SES. Neighborhood-level SES was a continuous measure and captures the proportion of inhabitants in the neighborhood with \u201clow economic standard\u201d, which is defined by Statistics Sweden as the number of people living in a household with an economic standard that is less than 60% of the national median value45. Other covariates considered in sensitivity analyses included birth month and low birth weight.\nStatistical methods\nThe main analyses applied binary logistic regression models with ASD or childhood autism as the outcome in a univariate model and two multivariate models using exposure data during pregnancy where missing observations were replaced with imputed data. Concerning missing outcome and covariate data, however, complete-case analysis was applied. The first multivariate model was partially adjusted and included only variables that were significantly associated with the outcome when using the all-source (local) PM2.5 exposure variable: parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, sex of the child, and birth year. In addition to these variables, the second multivariate model, hereafter referred to as the fully adjusted model, also included maternal age, smoking status at first antenatal visit, maternal birth country, maternal education, annual household disposable income, and neighborhood-level SES. As correlation coefficients between the different sources of PM2.5 were very high (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Information), a single pollutant model was used. Linear exposure trends were assessed using a continuous increment corresponding to an interquartile range (IQR) increase in local PM2.5 concentrations. The PM2.5 sources' respective IQRs were as follows: 0.99 \u00b5g/m3 for all-source PM2.5, 0.33 \u00b5g/m3 for small-scale residential heating, 0.12 \u00b5g/m3 for tailpipe exhaust, and 0.31 \u00b5g/m3 for vehicle wear-and-tear. To check the assumption of linearity, associations were also investigated with the exposure variables in tertiles.\nThree sensitivity analyses were conducted using the fully adjusted model with all-source PM2.5 as the exposure and childhood autism as the outcome. One adjusted for birth month as a categorical variable, as air pollution may vary substantially throughout the year; there may, therefore, be seasonal effects in the risk of autism46. The second excluded children with a low birth weight (LBW; < 2500 g) because birth weight is a potential mediator of the effect: air pollution increases the risk for low birth weight47, and low birth weight is a risk factor for autism48. Lastly, the children of mothers born outside of Sweden were excluded, as previous studies have shown much a higher risk of childhood autism among children whose mothers emigrated from non-European countries47.\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 27. Odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported for all analyses.\nEthical considerations\nThe Lund University Ethical Committee approved this study prior to its realization (permission number 2014/696 and amendment 2016/211). As this was a register-based study, no formal informed consent was required. Lund University\u2019s rules and protocols on data collection and processing were strictly followed. To ensure data integrity and safeguard confidentiality, sensitive data was stored in LUSEC, a highly secure data management platform hosted by the Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Sweden, which utilizes data encryption and two-factor authentication. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. No personal identifying information is included in the present article.\nResults\nDescriptive information on the exposures, covariates, and ASD is documented in Table 1. Relationships between ASD and various markers of socioeconomic status, smoking intensity, BMI, and PM2.5 exposure were seen.\nAll-source PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was associated with ASD, with ORs of 1.33 (95% CI 1.13\u20131.57) in the partially adjusted model and 1.22 (95% CI 0.99\u20131.50) in the fully adjusted model (Table 2). An association was also found for exposure to PM2.5 from small-scale residential heating and ASD in the partially adjusted model [1.22 (95% CI 1.08\u20131.37)], but the association was less pronounced in the fully adjusted model: 1.12 (95% CI 0.94\u20131.34). Regarding the road traffic-related sources, both tailpipe exhaust and vehicle wear-and-tear were associated with ASD: ORs in the fully adjusted model were 1.30 (95% CI 1.05\u20131.60) and 1.24 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.50), respectively. Analyses utilizing exposure variables in tertiles did not suggest any major deviations from linearity (data not shown).\nResults for childhood autism (Table 3) were somewhat more pronounced compared to ASD as a group, with ORs of 1.34 (95% CI 1.05\u20131.70) for all-source PM2.5, 1.18 (95% CI 1.01\u20131.39) for small-scale residential heating, 1.46 (95% CI 1.15\u20131.85) for tailpipe exhaust, and 1.36 (95% CI 1.10\u20131.68) for vehicle wear-and-tear in fully adjusted models.\nConcerning the sensitivity analyses using the fully adjusted model, adjusting for birth month did not affect the OR estimate for childhood autism: 1.34 (95% CI 1.06\u20131.70). Additionally, when excluding LBW babies, the OR for childhood autism was 1.35 (95% CI 1.06\u20131.72), which is similar to the OR for all births [1.34 (95% CI 1.05\u20131.70)]. Limiting the study population to Swedish-born women resulted in lower ORs compared to the entire study population. For example, the OR for childhood autism associated with an IQR increase in all-source PM2.5 was 1.16 (95% CI 0.87\u20131.54) among Swedish-born women, compared to 1.34 (95% CI 1.05\u20131.70) for all women.\nDiscussion\nMain findings\nIn this population-based study from southern Sweden, associations were observed between exposure to nearly all investigated sources of local PM2.5, except for small-scale residential heating, during pregnancy and the broad diagnosis group ASD. Exposure to locally produced PM2.5 from each investigated source (all-source PM2.5, small-scale residential heating, tailpipe exhaust, and vehicle wear-and-tear) was associated with childhood autism, with associations being somewhat more pronounced than for ASD. Because ASD comprises all pervasive developmental disorders for which symptoms of neurodivergence do not have to be present by a specified age, these results may reflect the larger heterogeneity within the ASD group compared to childhood autism, which has stricter, more uniform diagnostic criteria.\nWhen considering only mothers born in Sweden, the associations tended to be lower than for that of the entire study population. Findings from previous research on environmental injustice in Scania showed that non-Swedish-born persons, as well as those with less education and lower income, had higher odds of being exposed to greater concentrations of air pollution49. In Sweden, children born to women who emigrated from Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East are, furthermore, more commonly diagnosed with autism47. Other than air pollution exposure and SES risk factors, a possible explanation for the higher proportion of autism diagnoses among immigrants is, for example, vitamin D deficiency50, which is particularly predominant among immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East living in Scandinavia51,52,53. Although data on vitamin D deficiency was not available for the present study, it is unlikely that this would explain our findings, especially since controlling for birth month did not affect the results.\nSmall-scale residential heating\nNo previous epidemiological studies investigating the effects of source-specific ambient wood smoke exposure from small-scale residential heating on autism development could be identified. Concerning neurological conditions in general, a longitudinal study in northern Sweden has indicated that PM2.5 from residential wood burning is associated with dementia incidence12. In an experimental study, exposure to wood smoke particles induced cytotoxicity and disrupted proliferation in exposed first trimester placenta cells; particles detected inside the cells also caused structural damage to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum54. Existing source-apportionment studies investigating prenatal exposures have mainly included pregnancy complications, where Delta-C (a marker for wood smoke) during wintertime was found to be associated with greater odds of developing early-onset preeclampsia55, and birth outcomes, where PM2.5 from biomass burning (i.e., ambient wood smoke) was associated with a lower risk of preterm birth56, low birth weight57, and stillbirth58. Despite this evidence on other adverse health effects, additional studies on wood smoke and autism are needed to corroborate our results.\nDue to its unique chemical composition, PM2.5 derived from wood smoke may have varying toxicity compared to other sources of ambient PM2.5. For example, a 2003 review stated that studies including residential wood combustion as a major source of PM reported higher relative risks for adverse health outcomes compared to general ambient PM estimations59. A study examining short-term exposure also found higher statistically significant risk-increases in mortality when 24-h average concentrations were used and stronger increased risks for deaths occurring in the cold season, both of which better represent PM2.5 exposure from wood burning compared to traffic60. There is much heterogeneity in the literature surrounding this source, its origins and its assessment, however, as a 2018 review found ambient PM from biomass burning to be less detrimental than other sources33, with a noted exception from Copenhagen61. In the present study, emphasis is placed on the positive associations observed for all PM2.5 sources, including small-scale residential heating, as opposed to comparing the size of each source's individual point estimates. Regardless, residential wood burning remains an air quality concern. Initiatives aiming to reduce ambient PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from wood smoke have luckily proven successful and have been shown to improve public health62.\nRoad traffic-related sources\nOur results suggest that both local PM2.5 from tailpipe exhaust and vehicle wear-and-tear contribute to the observed associations with autism. These findings are in line with our previous study on prenatal exposure to ambient NOX concentrations, mainly from traffic, and autism using the same cohort (MAPSS), where children in the highest exposure quartile had a 40% greater risk of developing ASD compared to those in the lowest42. Under the assumption of a causal association between PM2.5 and childhood autism, a health impact assessment conducted in Scania identified 3% of autism cases to be attributable to locally emitted PM2.5, of which ~ 30% is derived from traffic63. Outside our study setting, two case\u2013control studies from California found 15% increased odds64 and just over double the risk65 of autism development due to traffic-related PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy.\nHowever, studies conducted in Stockholm, Sweden, did not find associations between exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy and ASD66,67. Reasons for this conflict may include that those studies considered PM10 and NOX, while ours investigated PM2.5, which is the pollutant with the strongest evidence in connection to autism development according to systematic reviews18,19. Another register-based study in Stockholm not observing associations used \u201csymptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders\u201d as opposed to physician-diagnosed ASD66. Similarly, a study using four European cohorts, including a Swedish one, explored autistic traits, but did not find an association with air pollution, even for PM2.5; here, land-use regression models, with predictor variables including traffic and space heating, were used68. In neighboring Denmark, researchers found that exposure to traffic-related NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 in early infancy, not during pregnancy, was associated with autism69. In the present study, exposure during fetal life and postnatal life could not be adequately differentiated.\nOne study, conducted in Southern California, USA, on prenatal exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 that further differentiated between tailpipe exhaust and vehicle wear-and-tear in association with autism was identified32. Authors used tracers of carbonaceous tailpipe PM2.5, including elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), from diesel and gasoline fuel combustion as well as non-tailpipe particles rich in trace metals (copper, iron and manganese) from re-suspended dust, tire-wear and brake-wear. The observed hazards ratios (HR) for tailpipe tracers of PM2.5 were 1.11 (95% CI 1.06\u20131.16), 1.09 (95% CI 1.04\u20131.15) per interquartile increase of EC and OC, respectively32. For interquartile increases in non-tailpipe tracers of copper, iron and manganese, the HRs were 1.09 (95% CI 1.04\u20131.13), 1.14 (95% CI 1.09\u20131.20), and 1.17 (95% CI 1.12\u20131.22), respectively32. This is in line with our findings that PM2.5 from both tailpipe exhaust and vehicle wear-and-tear may contribute to air pollution\u2019s association with ASD. Interestingly, Rahman and colleagues found that the associations for tailpipe tracers were considerably attenuated when analyses were adjusted for non-tailpipe sources, while estimates for non-tailpipe tracers were generally unaltered when adjusting for tailpipe sources32. This indicates that the HRs for non-tailpipe emissions and ASD were independent of the effects of tailpipe emissions, further supporting their importance as a traffic-related source with negative health impacts.\nFuture research\nSystematic reviews on air pollution exposure and ASD development have noted both the pregnancy and postnatal periods to be decisive exposure windows19. With this, future studies should prioritize the discernment and investigation of specific vulnerable periods, such as pregnancy trimesters and late gestation versus the first year(s) of life, which was not possible in the present study.\nThe continued inclusion of residential wood burning in source-specific air pollution epidemiology is pertinent, as it has been shown to be a significant source of ambient PM, especially in wintertime, and has also been identified as a potential challenge toward air quality control due to the increase in recreational wood stove-use, particularly in urban areas across Europe70. Moreover, recent reviews33,35 on the health effects of PM exposure attributable to wood combustion are limited to mainly respiratory outcomes, with some cardiovascular and oncological outcomes included. Future research should, therefore, consider investigating additional health effects35, such as the development of autism where current literature is lacking. Such source-apportionment studies are needed to substantiate our results.\nAs only one prior study on autism could be identified that apportioned PM2.5 road traffic emissions into their respective tailpipe exhaust and vehicle wear-and-tear sources, future studies should consider source-specific separation. This source-apportionment of traffic-related air pollution would also be valuable for research on other health outcomes. The subsequent findings would provide a greater understanding of how distinct PM2.5 sources affect human health. Importantly, vehicle wear-and-tear from re-suspended dust, tires and brakes will continue to be a relevant source of PM, especially as larger proportions of vehicle fleets become electrified and tailpipe emissions are reduced.\nMethodological considerations\nA key strength of this study is its large sample population derived from the MAPSS birth cohort, comprising 98% of all births occurring in the hospital catchment areas throughout Scania. Utilizing a validated, high resolution dispersion model to estimate PM2.5 exposure and obtaining the exact geographic coordinates of each woman\u2019s home residence were also vital for accurate exposure estimates at the individual level. An additional strength includes the thorough outcome assessment performed by Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. It should be mentioned, however, that the prerequisites for autism diagnosis have likely changed over time worldwide. For instance, a Swedish study reported that the presence of significantly fewer symptoms appeared to be necessary to receive a clinical autism diagnosis between the years 2004 and 2014 compared to 1998 and 200771. Any such trends in our data should not have affected the results because the analyses were adjusted for birth year.\nFurthermore, health care systems in Sweden are tax-subsidized and are used by virtually all residents, which increases the ability to identify physician-diagnosed cases of ASD and childhood autism and record them in high quality healthcare databases. With this, outcome misclassification, response-bias, recall-bias, and selection bias were likely avoided. Information on covariates were similarly collected from well-managed, precise registers. Our results are also considered generalizable to study areas where the populations and sources of air pollution are comparable. The findings are relevant to both public health in general and the clinical setting specifically because they indicate that locally produced PM2.5 concentrations can affect the risk of autism among children. Finally, this study contributes evidence to an emerging research area investigating the health effects of local, source-specific air pollution exposure. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that locally produced PM may be more hazardous to human health than regional, background concentrations72.\nThis study also has several limitations. A sizeable proportion of the study population was missing data on exposure, outcome, and/or covariates. While missing exposure values were able to be imputed using exposure data from subsequent years, the absence of detailedness in the exposure data hindered our ability to fully distinguish between sensitive periods of pregnancy, i.e., trimesters, as well as between the entire pregnancy period and the first year(s) of life. These exposure windows tend to be highly correlated because air pollution concentrations are relatively stable between years, and only a limited proportion of women move to a new residential address, with new exposure concentrations, directly after giving birth. Still, the present study aims to describe prenatal exposure, and it is, therefore, described as such. Another limitation is that data on parental diagnoses was not available. Given that genetic factors account for a considerable part of the variation in autism development and emergence73, our results could partly be explained by heredity, if parents with autism were more likely to reside in areas characterized by higher concentrations of air pollution than parents without autism. Residual confounding may be present due to other risk factors for autism that are also associated with the exposure but are not accounted for in our statistical models, such as lifestyle factors and vitamin D deficiency. There is also potential for residual confounding with respect to SES, as indicated by results from the sensitivity analysis on Swedish-born women. Exposure misclassification may exist, as exposure was assessed at each woman\u2019s home residence, and participants\u2019 total exposure, including indoor, behavior-related, transport-related, and occupational, was not considered. However, this approach is deemed standard practice in air pollution epidemiology research, with the assumption that the resulting misclassification is non-differential. Moreover, we could not clearly distinguish between tailpipe exhaust and vehicle wear-and-tear due these sources\u2019 high correlation (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Information). Instead, more studies, preferably in a multi-cohort setting, are needed to increase statistical power. Finally, because the differences in ORs between the investigated sources of local PM2.5 were not formally tested, direct comparisons between our source-specific risk estimates could not be made.\nConclusion\nThese findings add to current evidence that prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with an increased risk of developing ASD, particularly childhood autism, and offers insight into these associations in a relatively low exposure setting. Additionally, this source-specific study indicates that both local PM2.5 from small-scale residential heating (mainly wood burning) and road traffic (tailpipe emissions and vehicle wear-and-tear) are relevant exposure sources. Our results also support existing literature that has documented the substantial health effects of locally produced particles, despite their relatively small contribution to PM\u2019s total concentrations compared to long-range, in-transported particles.\nData availability\nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are stored on a secure server and are not publicly available because they contain sensitive information (on health data, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status) and, therefore, cannot be shared openly. However, they are available from Anna Oudin (anna.oudin@med.lu.se) on reasonable request.\nReferences\nCohen, A. J. et al.

      "text": "Although it was too late for him to benefit, Daniel Kinel felt relieved in December when the Environmental Protection Agency finally banned TCE. The compound, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines, can cause cancer, organ damage and a potentially fatal heart defect in babies, according to independent studies and the EPA. It has also been shown to greatly increase people\u2019s chances of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nKinel and three of his colleagues were diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease. They all worked in a law office in Rochester, New York, that sat next to a dry cleaner that had dumped TCE into the soil. Kinel was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative condition at age 43, after working there for seven years. His three colleagues have since died. At least 15 of the firm\u2019s partners developed cancers related to TCE.\n\u201cIt felt good that we were finally getting rid of this terrible chemical,\u201d said Kinel, whose symptoms now make it impossible to type, write or work as a lawyer. \u201cMy children and grandchildren would be protected.\u201d\nBut his feeling of solace has been short-lived.\nThe ban has been challenged on multiple fronts since President Donald Trump assumed office for a second time in January. Republicans in the Senate and House introduced resolutions to repeal the ban, which was vulnerable to being overturned through the Congressional Review Act because it was issued shortly before the inauguration. Meanwhile, companies and trade groups have sued to stop the ban in court. A Trump executive order delayed the implementation of the ban until March 21. And last week, the EPA asked a federal appeals court to further delay the ban until the end of May.\nTCE, short for trichloroethylene, is one of five toxic substances for which full or partial bans put in place by the EPA under President Joe Biden are now under threat. The Trump administration told the courts that it wants to review all five bans to determine whether they should be rolled back. Those banned substances include a deadly paint stripper called methylene chloride; PCE, a solvent that\u2019s similar to TCE; carbon tetrachloride, which is used as a cleaning fluid; and the cancer-causing mineral asbestos. David Fotouhi, the lawyer Trump nominated to be second-in-command of the agency, tried to overturn the asbestos ban in October, when he was serving as an attorney for a group of car companies. The EPA classifies all of the recently banned chemicals as either carcinogenic or probably carcinogenic to humans.\nBut the EPA\u2019s ban on TCE is in greater peril than the rest because it has yet to take effect. The prohibition on the chemical was to begin this year for all consumer uses and many industrial and commercial uses. The EPA allowed a more gradual phasing out for more than a dozen industrial uses, such as for some aerospace and defense applications. In those cases, the Biden EPA required employers to provide health protections for workers who come into contact with TCE. The Trump EPA\u2019s recent petition to the federal appeals court to extend the ban\u2019s delay would also mean that employers would not be required to implement the new health protections for workers.\nDelaying the ban means that people will continue to be exposed to the chemical, which causes liver cancer, kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as holes in infants\u2019 hearts that can be fatal. While safer alternatives now exist for many of its uses, TCE has seeped into the drinking water of more than 17 million people in the U.S., according to data compiled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. Dangerous plumes of TCE have been identified in Woburn, Massachusetts; Wichita, Kansas; and Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base in North Carolina, where hundreds of service members developed Parkinson\u2019s disease and cancer. There is another TCE plume on Long Island in New York, in the district abutting the one that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin represented in Congress.\nThe idea that people will still be exposed to TCE infuriates Jerry Ensminger. This chemical \u201cneeds to go away,\u201d said the retired Marine Corps master sergeant who\u2019s an outspoken advocate for military families exposed to TCE. Ensminger\u2019s daughter Janey died from leukemia when she was 9; Ensminger said Janey was conceived at Camp Lejeune and the family lived there during most of the pregnancy\u2019s first trimester, then returned when she was 6. Ensminger recalled seeing workers on the base dip truck engines into vast metal vats of TCE in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nScientists began raising concerns about the toxicity of TCE almost a century ago. The EPA\u2019s work on the chemical proceeded slowly. In 1987, it deemed TCE a \u201cprobable human carcinogen.\u201d In 2001, a draft EPA assessment found the chemical to be more toxic than previously thought and highly likely to cause cancer. The conclusion came under attack from some industry and government scientists. The Department of Defense, which is responsible for hundreds of TCE-contaminated sites, criticized the report as based on \u201cjunk science.\u201d Two reviews by panels of independent scientists, however, found the assessment was sound. Still, the EPA didn\u2019t begin drafting stricter regulations on TCE until the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nThose efforts were dealt a blow during Trump\u2019s first term when the EPA weakened a report on TCE\u2019s effects on fetal heart abnormalities and stopped work on the new regulations. Nancy Beck, who before joining the first Trump administration had been a high-level lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade group, presided over the EPA\u2019s chemical program when it pulled back from the TCE ban and, more broadly, retreated from rules that the chemical industry saw as burdensome.\nAfter returning to the private sector, Beck was recently named the principal deputy assistant administrator in the EPA\u2019s office of chemical safety and pollution prevention. She did not respond to requests for comment.\nHer appointment has left environmentalists despairing over the fate of the long-awaited TCE ban.\n\u201cThe same industry lobbyist who was in charge of EPA\u2019s chemical program before is in charge of it again,\u201d said Daniel Rosenberg, director of federal toxics policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWhen she was there the first time, she moved heaven and earth to weaken the evaluation of the chemical and downplay the hazard TCE posed to people\u2019s health. That appears to be where this is headed again.\u201d\nMore than 100 groups representing public health, environment and community interests recently sent a letter to Zeldin urging him to reinstate the TCE ban. Referencing Zeldin\u2019s proclaimed interest in clean water for every American, the letter noted that the EPA estimated its rule would produce $20 million in health benefits from reduced cancer rates and said that \u201cdelaying implementation of these rules will lead to preventable death, disease and incapacitation and increase medical costs and hardships to families and communities.\u201d This week, environmental and labor groups filed a court brief opposing the EPA\u2019s efforts to delay implementation of the TCE ban.\nThe EPA did not respond to questions about the TCE ban. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who introduced the resolution to repeal the TCE ban in the Senate, and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, and Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn., who introduced a resolution for its repeal in the House, also did not respond to inquiries from ProPublica. A spokesperson from the American Chemistry Council referred ProPublica to its press release from December, which acknowledged that the EPA had included \u201cimportant adjustments\u201d in the TCE ban to provide flexibility to affected industries.\nIn a press release about his bid to repeal the ban, Kennedy said that the \u201cBiden administration waged war against America\u2019s chemical producers,\u201d and he urged Congress to \u201cmove quickly to take off the handcuffs that President Biden placed on Louisiana and U.S. businesses.\u201d In the same release, Harshbarger described the TCE ban as \u201cone of many examples of the Biden Administration\u2019s overregulation.\u201d\nIn a hearing about chemical regulation in the House in January, Harshbarger said that a company in her district, Microporous, which makes membranes used in lithium-ion batteries, is facing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d from the TCE ban. The ban made an exception for the use of TCE for this purpose, allowing the battery industry to continue using it until 2044. Microporous, which has challenged the ban in court, did not respond to a question about why it needed 20 years to find a suitable replacement for TCE.\nSince Trump\u2019s inauguration, the EPA has been touting its efforts to roll back environmental protections. Earlier this month, the agency announced the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history,\u201d listing 31 rules it planned to step away from, related to oil and gas, air pollution and greenhouse gases. The agency celebrated the announcement with a 6,500-word press release that included praise from 61 industry leaders, CEOs and Republican politicians.\nStill, some who have been focused on TCE were surprised that the Trump administration was delaying and reconsidering the recent ban. \u201cI thought it was a done deal,\u201d said Dr. Sara Whittingham, a retired United States Air Force flight surgeon who was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease at 46. When she heard that the rule might be repealed, she was aghast. \u201cWhat the heck, how can nobody care about this?\u201d she said. \u201cThis should be a nonpartisan issue.\u201d\nWhittingham believes her disease may stem from the two years she spent as an aircraft maintenance officer at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, from 1996 to 1998. Her office was above a shop where workers used TCE to clean engine parts.\nLast week, Whittingham teamed up with two friends, both Air Force graduates who were diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s as women in their 40s, to urge people to pressure Congress to drop the resolutions.\n\u201cWe signed up to go fight for our country,\u201d she said, but now the attitude seems to be, \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t care about your health, you\u2019ve already signed on the dotted line.\u2019 It\u2019s a kind of a kick in the face.\u201d\nBefore being diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, Whittingham had hoped that her children would follow her career path. But recently she discouraged her daughter, who is a senior in high school, from joining the military. The health risks, she said, were too high."

      "text": "At a glance\n- The National Exposure Report presents data collected since 1999-2000 on chemical presence in the human body.\n- Samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey are used to determine levels of environmental chemicals by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.\n- The presence of a chemical doesn't imply health risks; further research is necessary to establish safe levels and potential adverse effects.\nOverview of individual samples\nThe National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals (National Exposure Report) presents nationally representative, cumulative biomonitoring data gathered since 1999\u20132000.\nIn each survey period, the reported chemicals or their metabolites were measured in blood, serum, and urine samples from random subsamples of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). These subsamples typically consisted of about 2,500 participants \u2013 exact numbers are included in the tables. Survey data and samples are collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics. CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory (Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS), National Center for Environmental Health) used mass spectrometry methods to obtain the blood, serum, and urine exposure measurements presented in the National Exposure Report.\nThe National Exposure Report is divided into three sections:\n- Analysis of Whole Blood, Serum, and Urine Samples (Individual Samples)\n- Analysis of Pooled Serum Samples for Select Chemicals (Pooled Samples)\n- Analysis of Chemicals Found in Cigarette Smoke in a Special Sample of U.S. Adults (Chemicals in Cigarette Smoke)\nThe term environmental chemical refers to a chemical compound or chemical element present in air, water, food, soil, dust, or other environmental media (e.g., consumer products). Biomonitoring is the assessment of human exposure to chemicals by measuring the chemicals or their metabolites in human specimens such as blood or urine. A metabolite is a chemical alteration of the original compound produced by body tissues. Blood, serum, and urine levels reflect the amount of the chemical that gets into the body by all routes of exposure, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption. The measurement of an environmental chemical in a person's blood or urine is a measure of exposure; it does not by itself mean that the chemical causes disease or an adverse effect. Research studies, separate from these data, are required to determine which blood or urine levels are safe and which are associated with disease or an adverse effect.\nThe National Exposure Report provides geometric means and percentiles of environmental chemicals by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity for blood, serum, and urine levels measured in individual samples. For serum levels measured in pooled samples, weighted arithmetic means, and unadjusted standard errors are provided for categories defined by race/ethnicity, sex, age group, and survey years. More in-depth statistical analysis, including multivariate analysis incorporating health endpoints and other predictive variables, is beyond the scope of this document. We encourage scientists to examine the data further through analysis of the raw data available at NHANES."

      "text": "REGULATORY RELIEF FOR CERTAIN STATIONARY SOURCES TO PROMOTE AMERICAN CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING SECURITY\nBy the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\n1. The United States relies on a strong chemical manufacturing sector to support industries like energy, national defense, agriculture, and health care. These facilities produce essential inputs for critical infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, medical sterilization, semiconductors, and national defense systems. Maintaining a robust domestic chemical industry is vital to safeguarding the supply chains that underpin our economy and to reducing the Nation\u2019s dependence on foreign control over materials critical to national resilience. As adversaries expand influence over key inputs, continued domestic production is essential not only to economic resilience but also to military readiness, public health, and national preparedness.\n2. On May 16, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule titled New Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry, 89 FR 42932 (HON Rule). The HON Rule imposes new emissions-control requirements on certain chemical manufacturing facilities, some of which were promulgated pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412.\n3. The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations. Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions. For many facilities, the timeline for compliance as set forth at 89 FR 42953-42955 would require shutdowns or massive capital investments before any proven pathway to compliance exists. The HON Rule imposes requirements that assume uniform technological availability across facilities, despite significant variation in site conditions, permitting realities, and equipment configurations. A disruption of this capacity would weaken key supply chains, increase dependence on foreign producers, and impair our ability to respond effectively in a time of crisis. These consequences would ripple across sectors vital to America\u2019s growing industrial strength and emergency readiness.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the HON Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with those aspects of the HON Rule that were promulgated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412 for a period of 2 years beyond the HON Rule\u2019s relevant compliance dates (Exemption). This Exemption applies to all compliance deadlines established under the HON Rule applicable to the stationary sources listed in Annex I, with each such deadline extended by 2 years from the date originally required for such deadline. The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such 2-year period, these stationary sources will be subject to the emissions and compliance obligations that they are currently subject to under the applicable standard as that standard existed prior to the HON Rule. In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:\na. The technology to implement the HON Rule is not available. Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the HON Rule by the compliance dates in the HON Rule.\nb. It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this proclamation.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.\nDONALD J.

      "text": "Trump EPA Announces Reconsideration of Air Rules Regulating American Energy, Manufacturing, Chemical Sectors (NESHAPs)\nWASHINGTON \u2013 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the agency will reconsider multiple National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) affecting a broad range of American industrial sectors. In doing so, EPA is ensuring appropriate protections for human health and the environment based on the best record possible. The Trump Administration is considering a 2-year compliance exemption via Section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act for affected facilities while EPA goes through the rulemaking process.\n\u201cEPA is moving forward with the reconsideration of a number of air rules that cover nearly every sector of the American economy. During this review, we will ensure the appropriate protections for human health and the environment based on the best record possible. Breathing clean air, living on clean land, and drinking clean water are all shared goals while we also do our part to usher in a Golden Age of American success,\u201d said EPA Administrator Zeldin.\nSpecifically, EPA is initially reconsidering NESHAPs for integrated iron and steel manufacturing, rubber tire manufacturing, synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry, commercial sterilizers for medical devices and spices, lime manufacturing, coke ovens, copper smelting, and taconite ore processing.\nEPA intends to evaluate other NESHAPs and New Source Performance Standards to determine whether they should be reconsidered.\nThis was announced in conjunction with a number of historic actions to advance President Trump\u2019s Day One executive orders and Power the Great American Comeback. Combined, these announcements represent the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in the history of the United States. While accomplishing EPA\u2019s core mission of protecting the environment, the agency is committed to fulfilling President Trump\u2019s promise to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, restore the rule of law, and give power back to states to make their own decisions."

  "argos_summary": "Erin McCanlies, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has been studying the link between parental exposure to workplace chemicals and autism for two decades. However, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., her division was eliminated, and funding for autism research has been significantly cut, raising concerns among scientists about the direction of autism research and the potential manipulation of data to support Kennedy's controversial views on vaccines. Despite Kennedy's promise of a new $50 million autism research initiative, many researchers fear it will ignore established findings and lack transparency.",
