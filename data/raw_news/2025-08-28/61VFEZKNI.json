  "description": "New York Mets rookie pitcher Nolan McLean made franchise history on Wednesday as he twirled an eight-inning gem against the Philadelphia Phillies.",
  "content": "New York Mets pitcher Nolan McLean has been a bright spot in the team\u2019s resurgence over the last few weeks and made history on Wednesday night against the Philadelphia Phillies.McLean lasted eight innings and struck out six in the 6-0 win over the Phillies, inching New York to within four games of the National League East division lead. With the gem of an outing, he accomplished something neither Tom Seaver, Dwight Gooden, Jacob deGrom nor anyone else in the blue and orange had ever done \u2013 win his first three MLB starts.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\"He\u2019s a stud, man,\" Mets infielder Mark Vientos said after the game. \"It\u2019s so fun to be a part of what he does on day-to-day basis.\"He started the first game of his MLB career on Aug. 16 against the Seattle Mariners. He struck out eight and allowed only two hits in the Mets\u2019 3-1 win. Last week, he went seven innings against the Atlanta Braves, allowing two runs on four hits in the Mets\u2019 12-7 win.The start against Philadelphia on Wednesday was as impressive given the amped-up pressure the organization has on itself going into the final month of the season.PHILLIES' JESUS LUZARDO RECEIVES EJECTION AS HE CALLS OUT UMPIRE ON HIS WAY TO DUGOUT\"All I can say is wow,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"It\u2019s just everything about the kid \u2014 not only what we\u2019re seeing on the mound, just the way he carries himself. He\u2019s got electric stuff, but he\u2019s got pitchability. He knows what he\u2019s doing on the mound. He knows how to manipulate the baseball. He knows what hitters are trying to do. He\u2019s not afraid to use all his pitches.\"The Mets have gone 8-3 since McLean won his first start. McLean lowered his ERA to 0.89 \u2013 the lowest in team history for a rookie in his first three starts. Seaver held the mark previously with a 1.19 ERA over his first three starts in 1967.\"I\u2019ve always been a believer in my stuff. I\u2019m a confident guy,\" McLean said. \"Obviously, the hitters here are the best in the world and I know that. But I also know I have good stuff. And if I go out there and execute, I can get a lot of guys out as well.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",
