  "title": "Is Perplexity\u2019s $34 billion offer to buy Chrome real or a marketing stunt?",
  "description": "Tuesday\u2019s disclosure that Perplexity wants to buy Chrome may be intended to influence a federal judge more than Google/Alphabet. Either way, it\u2019s getting a lot of attention, which might have been Perplexity\u2019s primary goal.",
  "content": "AI startup Perplexity has sent Google/Alphabet an offer to buy Chrome for $34.5 billion. The offer was made in a letter from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas to Sundar Pichai, who serves as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google. A copy of the letter, provided to Computerworld by Perplexity, pledges to maintain Google as the browser\u2019s default search engine, although it points out that users can always change that via settings. The letter promises to maintain, support, and promote Chromium, the open source project underpinning Chrome. \u201cWe intend for this commitment to be legally binding, subject to regulatory approval,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also promises to invest \u201c$3 billion over 24 months in reliability, performance, security, and customer support scale; pursue appropriate security certifications; maintain a quarterly customer-facing roadmap and convene an Open Web Advisory Board within 120 days post-close.\u201d However, the letter does not promise to retain all Chrome employees, but said that Perplexity will \u201cextend offers to a substantial portion of designated key personnel and implement retention programs to preserve expertise and continuity.\u201d It also said, \u201cthis proposal is designed to satisfy an antitrust remedy in [the] highest public interest by placing Chrome with a capable, independent operator focused on continuity, openness, and consumer protection.\u201d\n\nThe backdrop to the story, and potentially the sole reason for the acquisition offer, is a federal court case to determine whether Google should be forced to sell off units to undercut its supposedly monopolistic hold on web search. US District Court Judge Amit Mehta is currently considering a decision about the actions the court will order. Analysts were mixed on the implications of such a move. \u201cMy brain says \u2018marketing stunt,\u2019\u201d said Jason Andersen, a VP/principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. Perplexity has been quiet for the last few months, Andersen said, \u201cand this is them taking a shot to get their name out there so people don\u2019t forget them. Their competition is making a lot of noise right now.\u201d\n\nBrian Jackson, a principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, had a more charitable take. Jackson said that \u201cpart of the genius of Perplexity\u2019s play\u201d is that it comes right before the judge\u2019s decision. Jackson saw it as a way to let Google avoid an unfavorable judicial decision by moving Chrome to a third party. The financial portion of the offer also raised some issues. Some questioned whether Perplexity can justify spending $34.5 billion on a browser, and even whether it can raise that much money at all, given that Chrome users could easily abandon the browser if it is disconnected from the Google universe of products.\n\nJackson said he thinks that the price tag Perplexity placed on Chrome is too low. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is fair market value. It probably [should sell for] twice as much, at least.\u201d Google did not initially report the offer to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but given that parent company Alphabet reported $350 billion in annual revenue last year, the offer might not have been considered material. While it is noteworthy that the letter promises to not change the default search engine from Google, it doesn\u2019t address Chrome\u2019s most compelling feature: The browser\u2019s seamless integration with a large number of Google services, including Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive and YouTube.\n\nThere are pros and cons to whether the tight Google app integration would survive a Perplexity acquisition. Perplexity might want to instead integrate its own services, but doing so might risk alienating the users it is paying for. Given that the browser is free, its users have no financial reason to stay if the value seems diminished. But would Google permit that integration to survive? Depending on the judge\u2019s order, it might have little reason not to. That tight integration delivers a lot of revenue. If Google/Alphabet is not permitted to create a browser for those services, it might simply let Chrome remain so linked. \u201cA lot of the entrenched value is in the [Google apps] integration,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nAndersen said that Comet, a recent Perplexity extension to Chrome which allows interaction with the AI from within Chrome, might help explain Perplexity\u2019s interest. Andersen said he has been testing Comet and found it unimpressive, adding that it was \u201ca little slow\u201d and \u201cthere were certain tasks that I could do faster on my own. It was intriguing but still early. Maybe not there yet.\u201d But, Andersen said, \u201cif Perplexity was to buy the Chrome browser, they could remedy the complaints I had\u201d because they would have direct access to, and control over, the browser source code.\n\nAndersen also said that Perplexity might welcome keeping the Google app integrations. \u201cPerplexity only has one or two services to plug into Chrome, whereas Google has hundreds,\u201d he said. He also said that he sees a different path if the judge orders Google to sell Chrome. Google parent Alphabet could simply shift it to another part of the company and then strictly wall it off to address the judge\u2019s concerns, not unlike the way many financial firms isolate sensitive business units to maintain compliance. \u201cIf they lose [in court], they are not going to sell it,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cThey are going to find a way around it.\u201d",

      "text": "Perplexity managed to use Apple\u2019s own APIs to supersede Siri, Google and everyone else as the iPhone\u2019s best place to get information. Credit: iStock/Tippapatt \u201cJust Google it.\u201d That\u2019s how most people found information they were interested in for more than a quarter-century. All that is changing now. Today, the main reason fewer people are \u201cGoogling it\u201d is that users are turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper, Chatsonic, HuggingChat, Socratic, Grok, DeepSeek, IBM watsonx Assistant, Pi, and Character AI. Or even more powerfully, they\u2019re using tools that integrate old-fashioned search results with LLM-powered chatbot information, including Google Search (with Gemini), Microsoft Bing (with Copilot), You.com, and Perplexity AI. Old-school search engines used to give you links to websites that contained the information people were seeking. Nowadays, more and more want the answers directly \u2014 even if the tool also provides links. This just-give-me-the-answer idea is perfect for a future in which people will ask an always-present assistant for the kind of information they used to get from Google. Smart glasses, of course, will be the main interface to arbitrary information, but other wearables, mobile devices, IoT devices and general purpose computers will enable a personal assistant that knows all about the world and knows all about us, individually and personally. I\u2019ve been living in this future recently, and I can tell you that it will prove irresistible to most people. Perplexity\u2019s great leap forward Perplexity AI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system launched in 2022 that answers questions directly by searching the web in real time, pulling from news sites, academic journals, and databases, then writing up a summary with accompanied search links. It uses AI models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 to understand your question, find the best information, and explain it in plain English. In February, Perplexity added a feature called \u201cDeep Research,\u201d which reads hundreds of sources, and reasons through the material to produce a very detailed, well-organized report. Then in April, Perplexity unveiled a new version of the company\u2019s iPhone app, which provides a glimpse into the future of getting information from an always-present assistant. For starters, it became an actual assistant, rather than just being an AI search tool. It can now do things even Siri, Apple\u2019s own assistant, can\u2019t do \u2014 which is somewhat astonishing, given how closed and Apple-centric the company\u2019s operating systems tend to be. For example, you can use your voice to ask Perplexity on your iPhone to play a song from Apple Music, open a podcast, set reminders, schedule calendar events, or even book a ride with Uber. It can scan your Apple Calendar and read out your appointments or add a reminder. It can bring up Apple Maps and give you directions or send an email through Apple Mail. Perplexity also goes beyond what Siri can do by opening third-party apps like OpenTable or YouTube and pre-filling reservation requests or video searches. For example, if you ask it to find a dinner reservation, it\u2019ll fill in the date, time, and number of guests in OpenTable, so all you have to do is tap \u201cBook.\u201d If you want to find a specific moment in a YouTube video, just describe it, and Perplexity will queue it up instantly. One of the most practical features is that Perplexity saves every conversation as a \u201cThread\u201d in the app, so you can revisit or continue a previous task anytime. You can even add shortcuts to Perplexity on your home or lock screen for fast access. Of course, there are limits to what Apple lets Perplexity do. It can\u2019t send text messages directly, set alarms, control core iPhone functions like muting notifications, or access the camera for live object recognition. At this point, Android users are yawning at the mention of these features. The Android version of Perplexity got many of these capabilities and more back in January. On Android, Perplexity Assistant can write emails, set reminders, book rides, make reservations, play media, and even use your phone\u2019s camera to answer questions about what it sees or what\u2019s on your screen. It acts as a layer on top of your device, integrating with many apps so you don\u2019t have to switch between them, and supports multimodal input and multi-app actions. Some features, like screen sharing and camera access for contextual awareness, are available on Android though not yet on iOS. But the most futuristic thing Perplexity can do, it can do on iPhone exclusively. The persistent assistant Perplexity AI\u2019s new iPhone app offers something the company calls \u201cpersistent listening.\u201d When enabled, the assistant keeps listening for your voice even after you leave the app or switch to something else. You tap the voice icon or use the Action Button to start, and from that point, the assistant keeps the microphone open, so you don\u2019t have to keep pressing anything or reopening the app to continue the conversation. This continuous listening works as long as the app or its background process is allowed by iOS to run, which means it can keep going for extended periods unless you close the app or revoke microphone access. The assistant is designed to pick up your voice even with background noise (it doesn\u2019t always work). It doesn\u2019t use a wake word like \u201cHey Siri,\u201d so it won\u2019t accidentally respond to other conversations; it\u2019s only listening for input after you\u2019ve started a session. If you stop interacting for about a minute or so, or close the session, it stops listening; until that point, it holds onto the context and keeps the channel open, making it feel like a real assistant that doesn\u2019t lose track of what you were talking about. Lately, I\u2019ve been taking advantage of the continuous listening feature via both my Ray-Ban Meta glasses and my AirPods. And this combination of continuous listening and hearing the answers privately from close-to-the-ears speakers, feels very much like something we\u2019re all going to do all the time in the near future. Perplexity\u2019s quiet coup is quite a feat. It\u2019s actually got me never using Siri anymore, even to do things like set reminders in Apple\u2019s Reminders app. (I\u2019m also no longer using Meta AI in my Ray-Ban Meta glasses anymore, at least for arbitrary information.) The tech industry is currently fighting a brutal, winner-take-all war for the future of personal assistants that do things for us, use our apps for us, get information for us and generally help us out all day, every day, even when we\u2019re walking around, driving or doing the dishes. Once the public gets in the habit of using one specific tool, it could be another quarter-century before that habit can be changed by new technologies. I\u2019d have to say that \u2014 for now \u2014 Perplexity AI is winning that war.

      "text": "A bit over 30 years ago, the Netscape browser took the online world by storm with a graphical interface that provided a lens to enjoy the internet in color. Now it\u2019s Comet\u2019s turn to shake things up. Credit: Agam Shah/Foundry The next browser revolution \u2014 this time with an AI interface \u2014 is just around the corner. At least, that\u2019s how OpenAI, The Browser Company, and Perplexity see it. These companies are all developing AI browsers designed to do an even better job of presenting information available on the web. Perplexity\u2019s Comet is among the earliest such browsers. And once users latch onto it, using Google\u2019s Chrome will feel like using a Walkman. (That\u2019s how Perplexity sees it, anyway.) To cut through the hype, Computerworld tested an early version of Comet to understand how AI could change browsing in much the same way Netscape shift the online landscape three decades ago. Comet, which is only available for now by invitation only, uses AI\u2019s best attributes to cut down the manual slog of clicking through links, creating tabs, finding files, and completing web-based work. The centerpiece is a built-in assistant, where users can type in search queries or ask the browser to complete tasks. A chatbot pops up in a side panel of the browser, while the main window shows web pages. The goal was to compare how an AI-powered web browser and a generic browser would complete the same task. I tested an early version of Comet, with Perplexity promising to add more functionality over time. Writing emails First, I connected Comet to my Gmail account; that allowed the browser chatbot to list and summarize my latest emails. The chatbot was also able to auto-compose and send an email from the Gmail account and it could search through emails by broadening the context beyond just keywords. (Typical Gmail searches look for specific words.) The AI browser saved time and effort from the conventional click-through process of composing and sending email. Automatically create tabs Even better was Comet\u2019s ability to automatically create multiple tabs based on queries to the AI assistant. Using this query, \u201cKeith Shaw\u2019s Today in Tech \u2014 create tabs in Comet browser for last 5 episodes\u201d delivered as promised. It automatically created five tabs linking to Apple Podcasts of the most recent Today in Tech episodes, which is hosted by my Foundry colleague Keith Shaw. Comet browser used AI to create five browser tabs linking to five recent episodes of Today in Tech. Agam Shah/Foundry The AI assistant used reasoning to determine the most recent episodes and browsed the web to find them. The automation saved time compared to the conventional browsing experience of manually determining the last five episodes and finding links via Google search. Create a shopping cart with one click Similarly, the query \u201cCreate a shopping cart for enchiladas for 1 person on Instacart\u201d automated the creation of a shopping cart on Instacart. It determined that the enchilada was for one person, identified six ingredients, browsed nearby stores, and automatically created a shopping cart. (The checkout and use of coupons required a manual process.) The AI assistant also followed up by providing directions on how to make enchiladas with the ingredients purchased on Instacart. A typical browsing experience would require knowing the ingredients and browsing through multiple stores to see whether the items were in stock. The automated experience using Comet was a real time saver. The Comet browser AI assistant filled up an Instacart shopping cart with ingredients for enchiladas. Agam Shah/Foundry Automating productivity Comet\u2019s AI features can also summarize, edit, and suggest improvements to documents. A few weeks ago, my martial arts instructor asked me to document the belt syllabus of Nintai, an eclectic martial art with cross-training in Korean and Japanese styles. Creating the syllabus is proving to be a highly involved manual task and includes putting together information scattered through different files. I wanted to see whether Comet would help me automate the process. I loaded the brown-belt syllabus from a document in Google Drive in the browser. The AI was able to summarize the text and provide suggestions to modify the document. Furthermore, the suggestions drew context from references to Nintai and my instructor in my browsing and email history. The AI also summarized videos about the style, which improved the document even further. I also asked the Comet chatbot to find documents related to Nintai in my Google Drive. Comet made an attempt, and it was fascinating to see how AI automated the entire browsing process. The browser window showed in real-time Comet trying multiple ways to access and open files to determine the content, which would help locate files related to Nintai\u2019s syllabus. It couldn\u2019t open the files, but it provided a hint at how AI browsers in the future could understand documents and boost productivity. Final thoughts Comet isn\u2019t perfect and retains the traditional manual browsing experience (because it\u2019s built on Chromium). It did take me a while to get used to a AI-assisted browsing and filling up shopping carts, much like the first time I sat in a Waymo. But Comet is still in beta and will likely mature. OpenAI has teased a possible web browser of its own (the latest speculation is it\u2019ll be called \u201cAura\u201d and arrive this summer), and is already planning an AI-powered productivity suite. Meanwhile, The Browser Company\u2019s Dia is available for download for Mac users on a waitlist. Dia was introduced after the company ditched its conventional Arc browser, which was known for its slick design but deemed irrelevant in the AI era. Who knows what will happen with Apple\u2019s Safari, given the company\u2019s slow start on AI? A Gemini add-on isn\u2019t available for Chrome, and Firefox, Chrome and Opera will also need AI extensions. But it seems likely that conventional browsers without AI features won\u2019t survive what\u2019s coming.
