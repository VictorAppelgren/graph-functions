  "summary": "Asian stock markets are mostly higher on Friday, largely due to positive cues from Wall Street and support from crude oil prices. The Australian stock market rebounded after four consecutive losses, with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 moving above the 7,400 level. The potential for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by mid 2022 is also raised. Reports from China suggest several bondholders have received overdue coupon payments from China Evergrande Group. The Japanese stock market also saw significant gains, with benchmark Nikkei 225 closing just below the 29,600 level. However, traders are cautious due to ongoing cases of COVID-19 in Victoria, where cases are high.",
