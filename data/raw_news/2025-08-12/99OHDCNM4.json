In addition, each airline will offer flights on each other\u2019s website and app, while JetBlue will provide United access to slots at JFK International Airport for up to seven daily round-trip flights out of JFK Terminal 6 starting as early as 2027.\nThe two airlines will also exchange eight flight timings at Newark, while United will move its website and mobile app\u2019s ability to sell hotels, rental cars, cruises and travel insurance to new technology and services offered by JetBlue\u2019s Paisly platform.\nDespite working together, JetBlue reportedly has no plans to merge with United, the industry news website Airline Geeks reported Thursday.\nThat report, responding to stories in an Italian publication about a possible merger, cited an email sent to JetBlue employees.\n\u201cDespite speculation and rumors you may have read on blogs and social media, it\u2019s important to point out that there is no agreement or plan for us to merge with United,\u201d the message said.\nThe partnership comes a little more than three months after JetBlue\u2019s president said the airline was discussing potential partnerships with several of its contemporaries after federal judges blocked its attempt to purchase Spirit Airlines in 2024 and its collaboration with American Airlines in 2023.\n\u201cIf we find a deal that\u2019s accretive, we\u2019ll absolutely do it,\u201d JetBlue President Marty St. George said a Barclays conference.\nAbout the partnership with American Airlines, St. George said: \u201cWhen I look at the benefits that we got from the partnership we had, I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s attractive for us.\u201d\nMeanwhile, United said last month that it will remove 4 percentage points of its scheduled domestic capacity, beginning in the third quarter, in response to the \u201ccurrent demand environment,\u201d while also retiring 21 aircraft earlier than anticipated."

      "text": "Fanatics Rolls Out \u201cFanatics ONE,\u201d a New Enterprise-Wide Loyalty Program Offering Next-Level Rewards, Access and Experiences\nThe tiered program allows fans to unlock a wide variety of perks that only Fanatics can offer across its platform and partners\nFanCash \u2013 Fanatics\u2019 rewards currency \u2013 has been significantly expanded for members to now use across many of its businesses\nFanatics has officially launched its new, enterprise-wide loyalty program, Fanatics ONE. As the company\u2019s first cross-business loyalty program, Fanatics ONE leverages the scale of the company\u2019s growing sports platform to offer a truly unique selection of rewards and experiences, including fan apparel, trading cards and collectibles, online sports betting and casino rewards, and access to unforgettable events.\nA key component of the Fanatics ONE experience is FanCash, the currency of sport, now more powerful than ever. Informed by fan feedback, the program expands on how FanCash can be redeemed, giving members access to an unmatched catalog of rewards, including apparel and exclusive shopping experiences, tickets, live card breaks and fixed-price trading card purchases on Fanatics Collect, bonus bets and casino credits, and much more.\nEligible fans with a preexisting Fanatics account are automatically enrolled in the Fanatics ONE program as members, with the initial migration completed earlier this summer. As members engage, they also earn tier points that help them climb the ladder to new benefits. Members can achieve five different tiers based on their FanCash earnings and frequency of activity, activating a variety of exclusive rewards and benefits. The tiers include: ONEmember, ONEmember pro, ONEgold, ONEplatinum, and ONEblack.\nThe entry level membership (ONEmember) includes 5% FanCash back on all purchases on the Fanatics App and up to 10% FanCash earned on all bets (win or lose) placed within Fanatics Sportsbook, free shipping and returns, and access to the most coveted product drops. Members can also participate in free-to-play games, contests and sweepstakes, with chances to win epic sports experiences, like a trip to an upcoming NFL Game in London.\n\u201cAs Fanatics has grown as a sports platform, we\u2019ve been methodically building a loyalty program that rightfully rewards fans for their passion across our full suite of experiences,\u201d said Tucker Kain, Fanatics Chief Strategy and Growth Officer. \u201cWe listened to what fans wanted \u2013 more unique rewards and more ways to spend their FanCash - and built a program that only Fanatics could deliver.

      "text": "As smartphones become critical to online and in-store shopping, U.S. merchants need to adjust to the evolving consumer behavior to stay relevant and competitive, according to a recent PYMNTS Intelligence report, \u201cThe 2025 Global Digital Shopping Index: U.S. Edition,\u201d commissioned by Visa Acceptance Solutions.\nThe report draws insights from a survey of 18,468 consumers and 3,464 merchants across eight countries conducted from Oct. 17, 2024, to Dec. 9, 2024. Our U.S. sample includes 3,110 consumers and 526 merchants.\nMobile Shopping and Consumer Behavior\nWhile mobile shopping is less common in the U.S. compared to global leaders like Singapore or the UAE, the report notes U.S. shoppers use mobile as a shopping tool. Consider 42% of U.S. shoppers used their mobile phones for their most recent retail purchase, whether online or in-store. This shift is more evident among younger consumers and parents. Millennials and Gen Z, for example, engage in digital shopping 62 times per month, considerably more than older generations like baby boomers, who engage about 29 times a month.\nParents, particularly those with children under their care, are also more likely to shop with their phones \u2014 engaging in digital shopping 1.6 times more frequently than non-parents. With these groups driving mobile shopping behavior, U.S. merchants must consider how they can meet the demand for mobile-friendly shopping experiences.\nTo keep up with consumer demands, U.S. merchants must focus on the digital features that enhance mobile shopping experience, the report notes. Consumers are not only using their phones to browse products; they expect a seamless, feature-rich shopping journey. Some of the most requested digital features include rewards programs, digital coupons, easy-to-navigate online stores, and accessible product information.\nFor instance, 67% of U.S. shoppers show interest in using rewards and loyalty programs, but 36% of merchants in the U.S. have yet to implement them. Digital coupons also top the list, with 66% of consumers wanting to use them, yet many merchants are not offering this feature. This creates a gap where U.S. businesses can differentiate themselves by providing the digital experiences their customers seek.\nStored payment credentials are another critical feature. According to the study, 67% of U.S. shoppers used stored payment credentials for their most recent online purchase. This is the highest percentage among the countries surveyed, highlighting the importance of making it easy for customers to make repeat purchases quickly and securely. Merchants that offer secure, fast, and convenient payment options are more likely to gain consumer trust and repeat business.\nHow Merchants Can Stay Competitive\nTo remain competitive in the mobile-first era, U.S. merchants need to adopt several strategies that align with consumer expectations:\n- Optimize for Mobile Shopping: As more consumers rely on their phones for browsing and shopping, merchants must prioritize creating mobile-friendly experiences. This includes designing responsive websites and mobile apps that provide a seamless shopping journey, from product discovery to checkout.\n- Offer Key Digital Features: U.S. consumers want certain digital features, including rewards programs, digital coupons, and easy-to-navigate online stores. Merchants who implement these features will enhance the shopping experience, encourage repeat visits, and increase customer loyalty. These tools are essential for standing out in a competitive market.\n- Support Stored Payment Credentials: With many consumers preferring to use stored payment methods for faster checkouts, merchants must offer secure and convenient options for saving payment information. This not only speeds up the purchasing process but also fosters trust and convenience, two factors that drive repeat purchases.\n- Integrate Digital Features for In-Store Shopping: Mobile shopping isn\u2019t just about online experiences \u2014 it also impacts physical stores. Many U.S. consumers use their phones to enhance their in-store experience, such as checking product availability, comparing prices, or finding store locations. Merchants must integrate digital tools in their physical stores, offering in-store wayfinding, inventory checks, and price-matching capabilities to create a consistent experience across channels.\n- Prioritize Convenience and Security: For merchants to succeed in the mobile-first era, they must ensure their payment systems and digital features are not only convenient but also secure. Consumers are more willing to store payment information with retailers they trust, and merchants need to address concerns around data security to build long-term relationships with their customers."

Available through Shake Shack\u2019s app and website, this program will offer discounts to customers who place two orders within specified periods of time, according to the email.\nBoth initiatives aim to drive traffic, increase frequency and build loyalty, the email said.\nBloomberg reported Wednesday that Shake Shack decided to launch its first loyalty program after completing a successful test earlier this year. In that test, the company found that the loyalty offering led customers to visit more often than they would have otherwise.\nA Wednesday blog post by Shake Shack dubs the $1 soda offer a \u201cShake Hack\u201d and says this is the first such offer, with more to come.\nShake Shack said in a May 1 earnings release that its first-quarter revenue was up 10.5% year over year and its comparable sales were up 0.2%.\n\u201cDespite macro uncertainties, we remain focused on creating durable value for all our stakeholders through initiatives to drive same-Shack sales including strengthening our culinary and calendar strategy and driving frequency,\u201d the company said in a May 1 shareholder letter.\nThe letter said Shake Shack had added a new offer capability to its app and web channels to drive repeat business and expand guest recognition capabilities.\nRewards are a key incentive when it comes to doing business, examining the goods and then checking out after hitting the buy button, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report commissioned by Visa Acceptance Solutions, \u201c2025 Global Digital Shopping Index.\u201d\nThe report found that 67% of shoppers said they either earned or wanted to earn rewards at the merchants where they had made their last purchase.\n\u201cPreferred payment methods, rewards, coupons, product details and easy-to-navigate digital stores can increase shopper confidence and conversion,\u201d the report said."
