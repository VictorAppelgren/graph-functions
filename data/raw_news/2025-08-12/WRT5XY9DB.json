  "description": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked a judge to jail Beto O'Rourke for fundraising efforts connected to the state\u2019s redistricting fight.",
  "content": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking a judge to jail Beto O'Rourke, claiming the former Democratic congressman violated a court order by fundraising to support the dozens of state Democratic lawmakers who have fled the state amid its redistricting battle.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s request builds on a previous order, granted by a Texas county judge earlier this month, barring O\u2019Rourke and his nonprofit, Powered by People, from raising money to help fund the Democratic lawmakers\u2019 exodus from the state more than a week ago. Paxton claimed in his filing to the Tarrant County court on Aug. 12 that O\u2019Rourke violated the fundraising block by soliciting donations through the Democrats\u2019 ActBlue platform.\n\n\"He\u2019s about to find out that running your mouth and ignoring the rule of law has consequences in Texas,\" Paxton said in a statement released alongside the filing. \"It\u2019s time to lock him up.\"\n\nPaxton\u2019s move is the latest in growing escalations between Democrats and Republicans in the Lone Star state, as the standoff over GOP attempts to redraw congressional boundaries in Texas. The redistricting attempt could add another five Republican seats to Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, and is seen as blatant gerrymandering efforts by Democrats.\n\nIn response, Democrats decamped the state en masse, many taking refuge in blue-led states like Illinois and New York, to prevent the vote from taking place in Austin, Texas, where the Republicans\u2019 firm majority would all but guarantee the revised maps pass.\n\nTexas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the arrest of the dozens of Democratic lawmakers who have fled while Paxton asked the state Supreme Court to oust them from office over their absence, arguing they abandoned their seats.\n\nIn the first sentence of the court filing, Paxton quoted the former congressman at an Aug. 9 Fort Worth event saying: \"There are no refs in this game, f--- the rules,\" claiming O\u2019Rourke was \"disparaging\u201d the previous court order.\n\nIn response, O\u2019Rourke posted the full clip of his speech at the event to X, saying that Paxton took his words out of context in the filing. In the full recorded video of the speech, O\u2019Rourke is speaking about the Democrats\u2019 attempts to put forward their own revised maps in states like California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Illinois, telling the crowd that blue states should redistrict now and \"not wait for Texas to move first.\"\n\n\"You may say to yourself, 'Well, those aren\u2019t the rules,'\" O\u2019Rourke says immediately after speaking about the Democrats\u2019 redistricting efforts. \"There are no refs in this game, f--- the rules, we are going to win. Whatever it takes, we are going to take this to them in every way that we can.\"\n\nO\u2019Rourke said in his post on X on Aug. 12 that the attorney general's office lied in its filing.\n\n\"We\u2019re seeking maximum sanctions in response to his abuse of office,\" he said. \"Taking the fight directly to this corrupt, lying thug.\"\n\nAlong with jail time, the attorney general is also requesting O\u2019Rourke be held in contempt and fined $500.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Who is Ken Paxton? Texas Attorney General's wife files for divorce\nAngela Paxton said she filed for divorce \"on biblical grounds\" after \"recent discoveries.\"\nKen Paxton, the Texas attorney general and GOP U.S. Senate candidate who has been embroiled in a series of controversies in recent years, confirmed that he and his wife, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, are divorcing.\nAngela Paxton, a Republican who represents the state's 8th senate district, announced the news on X July 10.\n\"Today, after 38 years of marriage, I filed for divorce on biblical grounds,\" she wrote. \"I believe marriage is a sacred covenant and I have earnestly pursued reconciliation. But in light of recent discoveries, I do not believe that it honors God or is loving to myself, my children, or Ken to remain in the marriage.\"\nKen Paxton released his own statement on X shortly thereafter, in which he attributed \"the pressures of countless political attacks and public scrutiny\" for the filing.\nAngela accused her husband of adultery, according to court filings obtained by The Texas Tribune. The divorce petition also says the couple has lived apart since June 2024, according to The Texas Tribune.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the court clerk's office for Collin County, Texas, where the divorce petition was filed, to obtain a copy.\nHere's what to know about Ken Paxton, a high-profile conservative and longtime ally of President Donald Trump.\nWho is Ken Paxton?\nKen Paxton is the incumbent attorney general of Texas, a role he has held since 2015. Before that, Paxton was a Texas state representative from 2003 to 2013, and a state senator for two years.\nIn April, Ken Paxton launched a bid to challenge U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, in the 2026 primary for Cornyn's Senate seat.\nPaxton graduated from Baylor University with a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in business administration. He also received a law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law and subsequently practiced as an attorney before his foray into politics, according to the Texas attorney general website.\nThe Texas attorney general met his wife, Angela Paxton, while they were both students at Baylor, per his website. They had been married for 38 years before she filed for divorce and share four children and two grandchildren.\nThroughout his time as Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton has been a staunch Trump ally, supporting many of the administration's policies, including immigrant deportations and strict border policies.\nTrump has called Paxton \"a very talented guy\" and a \"great attorney general.\"\nKen Paxton controversies: impeachment, alleged adultery\nKen Paxton has faced his share of controversies over the years, notably including a 2023 impeachment trial. He was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives on bribery charges, but the state Senate later acquitted him.\nThe trial in part stemmed from 2020 allegations from several of Paxton's former aides, who alleged abuse of office, bribery and other crimes. Some of the aides later filed a wrongful termination lawsuit, prompting a Texas House investigation into a request Paxton made for the state Legislature to fund a $3.3 million settlement to resolve the lawsuit.\nThe impeachment trial also saw dramatic testimony about his alleged extramarital affair. It's unclear whether the adultery reportedly cited in Angela Paxton's divorce petition is related.\nIn a separate case, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ken Paxton with securities fraud in 2016. State prosecutors pursued the case for years until the charges were dropped in 2024 as part of a pretrial agreement.\nSome of Ken Paxton's other legal entanglements include a since-tossed lawsuit from the State Bar of Texas over his efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 election, and a federal probe into criminal corruption.\nContributing: Kayla Jimenez, Aysha Bagchi, Davis Winkie, USA TODAY\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Texas Hold 'em: Gov. Abbott threatens legal action for absent Dems\nAfter more than 50 Democrats fled the state amid a redistricting battle, Greg Abbott gave them an ultimatum and deadline to return to Austin.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott threatened more than 50 Democrats with legal action and removal from the state legislature after the lawmakers fled the Lone Star State en masse Aug. 3 amid a heated redistricting battle.\nAt President Donald Trump's urging, Texas Republicans have proposed a revised congressional map that could give the party a leg up in next year's midterm elections and the ability to flip as many as five U.S. House seats.\nDemocrats in the state, limited by their minority position, employed one of their few viable methods of protest by leaving Texas to break necessary quorum. Many traveled to Illinois, greeted by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, while other, smaller groups landed in Boston, Massachusetts and Albany, New York.\nIn a memo late Sunday evening, Abbott said he would expel any Democrat who was not back in Austin by the time the legislature reconvened Aug. 4 at 3 p.m. CT.\n\"Democrats hatched a deliberate plan not to show up for work, for the specific purpose of abdicating the duties of their office and thwarting the chamber's business,\" the governor wrote. \"That amounts to an abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\"\nAbbott based his ultimatum on a 2021 nonbinding opinion from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. In it, Paxton asserts that district courts could rule to remove a lawmaker who has left in order to break quorum, leaving a vacancy that Abbott would then be able to fill.\nThe absent Democrats are already facing consequences in the form of a $500 per day fine for being out of state. The penalty was put in place after state Democrats in 2021 fled in order to protest new voting restrictions and halted operations for 38 days.\nDeep-pocketed donors and officials on the left \u2212 including Pritzker, a billionaire, and Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a congressional Texan and star fundraiser \u2212 have offered to assist Texas Democrats.\nAbbott, in his note, accused the state lawmakers of violating bribery laws by accepting the support.\n\"In addition to abandoning their offices, these legislators may also have committed felonies,\" Abbott wrote. \"I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons.\"\nTexas Democrats say they are not deterred by the governor's warnings.\nAt a press conference with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, state Rep. Jolanda Jones, a Democrat from Houston and an attorney, said Abbott was \"making up\" a threat he could not follow through on.\n\"He's going to come get us how?\" Jones added. \"Let me be clear \u2212 he's putting up smoke and mirrors.\""

      "text": "Which states are being impacted by Texas' redistricting battle?\nWhat started on the floor of the Austin, Texas statehouse last week has rapidly mushroomed into a multi-state standoff with national implications, as the Lone Star State\u2019s redistricting battle continues to bleed beyond its borders.\nDozens of Texas Democrats have fled to three blue states in a bid to stave off a vote on the proposed map, which could give Republicans five more seats in Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nSeveral Democratic state leaders have entered the fray, and two GOP lawmakers announced efforts to take the issue to the U.S. Capitol in recent days. President Donald Trump lent his opinion on the melee Aug. 5, as Texas Republicans\u2019 redistricting fight now stretches across at least five states and captures national attention.\nHere\u2019s how Texas\u2019 redistricting crisis has ballooned into state-on-state fights over the last week:\nIllinois, New York and Massachusetts host Texas Democrats\nThe governors of Illinois, New York and Massachusetts are hosting Democratic lawmakers from Texas after they fled their home state Sunday, Aug. 3. The lawmakers\u2019 mass absence from the legislature prevents the quorum Republicans need to call for a vote on the new map, which is likely to pass among its GOP majority.\nUnder the new maps, Texas' congressional districts in the Houston, Austin and Dallas metro areas would be redrawn, along with a handful in southern Texas, creating five additional districts that would have heavily favored Trump in last year's presidential race. By extension, these Republican-heavy new districts would very likely go to GOP candidates in congressional elections, strengthening the party\u2019s currently slim majority in Congress.\nMore than 50 of Texas' 67 Democratic lawmakers have fled the state as of Tuesday, Aug. 5, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered their arrests \u2212 though it's unclear whether and how Texas law enforcement will be able to work with out-of-state law enforcement to execute the arrest order.\nStates threaten to redraw their own maps in response\nNew York and California have threatened to launch their own redistricting, sparking a kind of political arms race between Democratic and Republican states.\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, though not hosting any Texas lawmakers, joined New York governor Kathy Hochul in threatening to use his state\u2019s overwhelming blue majority to counteract Texas Republicans\u2019 plans. Both governors lead two of the most powerful Democratic states.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in a press conference Monday, Aug. 4 that his plans are to \u201cfight fire with fire,\u201d instructing Democrats to move forward with an effort to redraw the most populous state\u2019s congressional districts if Texas moves forward with its proposed map. He said Democrats are moving forward with a plan to put the redistricting plan before voters on Nov. 4.\nIn a press conference the same day, Hochul discussed the possibility of new maps in her state.\n\"This is a war. We are at war,\" she said. \"And that's why the gloves are off and I say, 'Bring it on.'\"\nRepublicans in Missouri, New York and California propose their own responses\nIn red Missouri, a coalition of the state\u2019s conservative GOP lawmakers issued a statement on July 25 urging Gov. Mike Kehoe to call for its own redistricting effort, which would give Republicans an advantage. The governor's spokesperson Gabby Picard told POLITICO on Tuesday, Aug. 5 that Kehoe \u201cwill always consider options\u201d which \u201cprovide congressional districts that best represent Missourians\" regarding the push for a map redraw.\nBut not all GOP lawmakers appear to be on board with fighting one map with another. Two Republicans, Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Mike Lawler of New York announced that they will introduce bills to place nationwide limits on all such partisan gerrymandering. Kiley\u2019s proposal would prohibit mid-decade redistricting, which would likely spike Texas Republicans' efforts and the tit-for-tat proposals from New York and California.\nWhatever happens in Texas, the fight over Congress via redistricting will continue in Ohio later this month, where Republicans hold a supermajority in the state legislature.\nContributing: Phillip M.

      "text": "Bernie Sanders calls Texas redistricting push 'pathetic,' urges Dems to 'fight back'\nWASHINGTON \u2212 Progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders in a new interview called the Republican redistricting push in Texas \u201cpathetic\u201d and urged Democrats to \u201cfight back.\u201d\nSanders\u2019 remarks to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash come as Texas Democrats fled the Lone Star State Aug. 3. The lawmakers are trying to block a redistricting effort that could give House Republicans up to five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. President Donald Trump has pushed for the changes.\n\u201cWhat Trump is trying to do, he understands that there is a good chance that Republicans will lose control over the House,\" Sanders said.\n\"So what should Democrats do? Sit back and say, \u2018Oh, gee, Trump is doing this terrible - we can't do anything. Let them win the election,\u2019 when they shouldn't? So Democrats have got to fight back. I think it's pathetic, but I think that's what they've got to do,\u201d Sanders said.\nDemocratic governors Gavin Newsom of California, Kathy Hochul of New York and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois have threatened to launch their own redistricting efforts that could give Democrats a boost, sparking a tit-for-tat.\nRedistricting is required by federal law every 10 years following the release of new U.S. Census Bureau figures; however, Trump encouraged Texas Republicans to jumpstart the process in the middle of the decade. The president argued during an Aug. 5 appearance on CNBC that Republicans \"are entitled to five more seats\" in Texas because of his 2024 election victory in the state.\nThe 38-member Texas congressional delegation is currently comprised of 25 Republicans, 12 Democrats and there is one vacant seat that leans Democratic.\nTexas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last week ordered Texas law enforcement to arrest Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent the legislature from having a quorum to block a vote on redistricting. Many of the state lawmakers went to nearby Illinois.\nStill, Sanders argued in the new interview that Democrats have more work to do beyond the southern redistricting fight.\nThe longtime Independent lawmaker, who is traveling around the country on a \"fighting oligarchy tour,\" accused Democrats of turning their back on working class Americans. For example, he claimed former Vice President Kamala Harris was \u201cheavily influenced by very wealthy people\u201d in her 2024 presidential campaign, which she lost to Trump.\n\u201cHow do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda which speaks to the economic crisis facing working families?\u201d he said. \u201cYou have more income and wealth inequality today than we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nContributing: Joey Garrison"

      "text": "Texas Democrats seek to block redistricting vote by leaving state\nWASHINGTON \u2212 Democratic lawmakers in Texas said they were leaving the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts, a move sought to protect the Republicans' narrow House majority in next year's midterm elections.\nPresident Donald Trump has championed the redistricting plan, telling reporters he expects the effort to yield as many as five additional House Republicans. Republicans hold a narrow 220-212 majority in the House of Representatives, and three Democratic-held seats are vacant after members' deaths.\nIn a video shot in front of an airport, Democratic Rep. James Talarico said the redistricting plan amounted to \"rigging\" the 2026 elections.\n\"If you're seeing this video, my Democratic colleagues and I have just left our beloved state to break quorum and stop Trump's redistricting power grab,\" Talarico said in a video posted on X.\nSeveral other Texas Democrats said on X they were headed to Illinois, whose governor is Democrat J.B. Pritzker. A smaller contingent also traveled to Albany, New York, and Boston.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has threatened the more than 50 liberal lawmakers with expulsion from the state House, if they do not return to Austin by 3 p.m. CT Aug. 4.\n\"Democrats hatched a deliberate plan not to show up for work, for the specific purpose of abdicating the duties of their office and thwarting the chamber's business,\" Abbott wrote in a letter Aug. 3. \"That amounts to an abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\"\nAbbott, a former Texas attorney general, added that the representatives \"may also have committed felonies.\"\nTexas House Democrats responded to the governor with a four-word statement: \"Come and take it.\"\nStates are required to redistrict every 10 years based on the U.S. Census, but the Texas map was passed just four years ago by the Republican-dominated legislature. While mid-cycle redistricting occasionally takes place, it is usually prompted by a change in power at the legislature.\nRepublicans have pursued redistricting in a special legislative session that will also address funding for flood prevention in the wake of the deadly July 4 flash flooding that killed more than 130.\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee accused the absent legislators of \"neglecting their responsibility\" in office.\n\"Texas Democrats need to return home immediately, stop wasting taxpayer money on their media tour, and work collaboratively with Republicans in Austin to advance the future of Texas,\" Communications Director Mason Di Palma said in a statement.\nUnder current lines, Republicans control 25 seats, nearly two-thirds of the districts in a state that went for Trump last year by a 56% to 42% margin.\nRedistricting experts have said the plan could backfire if Republicans try to squeeze too many seats out of what is already considered a significantly skewed map.\nContributing: Alexandra Ulmer, Sandra Maler, Reuters"

There is a referee\u2014the Honorable Megan Fahey\u2014and there are rules\u2014namely, that a person violating a temporary restraining order can be fined up to $500 and jailed for up to six months.\nGiven Robert Francis\u2019s vulgar disdain for the rule of law and immense personal wealth, imprisonment is absolutely necessary to persuade him to obey the lawful restraining order issued by the Tarrant County court.\n\u201cBeto told me \u2018to come and take,\u2019 so I did and beat him in court. Now, he still thinks he\u2019s above the law, so I\u2019m working to put him behind bars,\u201d said Attorney General Paxton. \u201cRobert Francis flagrantly and knowingly violated the court order I secured that prevents him from raising funds and distributing any more Beto Bribes. He\u2019s about to find out that running your mouth and ignoring the rule of law has consequences in Texas. It\u2019s time to lock him up.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke, whose criminal past includes drunk driving, was sued by Attorney General Paxton last Friday for operating a misleading and fraudulent scheme to raise personal funds for rogue runaway lawmakers breaking quorum while advertising it as political fundraising. Just a few hours later, a court ordered O\u2019Rourke and his organization, Powered by People, to stop their unlawful fundraising operation and expenditures.\nDespite this crystal-clear court order and temporary restraining order, O\u2019Rourke continued to scam Texans by repeatedly promoting his illegal fundraising scheme over the weekend at events hosted by Powered by People.\nTo read the motion, click here."

      "text": "Texas GOP eyes redistricting, Dems poised to hit back. What to know.\nAt Trump's urging, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has requested lawmakers potentially redraw the state's electoral map. Opponents warn it could backfire.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 Texas state lawmakers head back to work on July 21 with a 30-day special session that's set to be dominated by a controversial redistricting effort pushed by President Donald Trump.\nIf Trump gets his way, Republicans could acquire new U.S. House seats in Texas, potentially saving their paper-thin majority in next year's midterm elections.\n\"Just a very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats,\" Trump told reporters on July 15.\nSome Republicans worry it's not so simple.\nRed districts, red lines\nGov. Greg Abbott has requested, at the White House\u2019s urging, that the legislature consider redrawing lines for a handful of Texas\u2019 38 congressional districts, giving Republicans the chance to flip seats red in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.\nThe prospect is raising Democratic hackles inside and out of the Lone Star State.\nIn California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is threatening to fight fire with fire. Former congressman and serial Texas candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke has advised Democrats to do just that.\nRepublicans are treading carefully, amid warnings that the controversial move \u2013 lumping reliably red voters into Democratic districts in order to shift election outcomes \u2013 could come with the unintended consequence of endangering incumbents in formerly safe districts.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the potential redistricting effort as the Texas legislature\u2019s summer session gets underway.\nTrump team urges redraw\nThe New York Times reported in June that Trump\u2019s political team was nudging state leaders to shift district boundaries to favor Republicans in contests up to five House seats.\nA district redraw in the middle of the decade is rare \u2013 typically states make those changes at the beginning of each decade, when new Census data becomes available.\nBut Republicans are staring down the barrel of historical precedent, in which the party that does not hold the White House often has the advantage in midterm congressional elections.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, already has the tricky task of navigating a narrow eight-seat majority, three of which are expected to be filled by Democrats in special elections later this year.\nChance of a backfire\nRepublicans currently control 25 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts.\nDemocrats have long salivated at the prospect of turning Texas blue. And now, they argue, any aggressive gerrymandering that squeezes Republican voters into neighboring districts could backfire and put the red districts they left at risk of a Democratic pick up.\n\u201cTexas Republicans are likely going to continue to act like political punks and bend the knee to Donald Trump's extreme agenda,\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said at a news conference July 15. \u201cIn doing so, they will jeopardize their own electoral careers.\u201d\nRep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, said in June that the House Texas delegation was working to \u201cbe on the same page\u201d about potential drawbacks of a 2026 redraw.\n\u201cWe assured each other, you need to bone up. We need to have a conversation,\u201d Sessions told reporters. \u201cWe need to think about what those impacts would be on the entire delegation.\u201d\nBlue states weigh in\nDemocrats have started drawing up a potential response, if Texas Republicans go through with their redistricting, the Texas Tribune reported.\nNewsom suggested in a July 16 press conference that his state could play hardball and change its electoral map to favor Democrats.\n\u201cWe can act holier than thou,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe can sit on the sidelines, talk about the way the world should be. Or we can recognize the existential nature that is this moment.\u201d\nFigures from other Democratic stronghold states have weighed in with similar tit-for-tat proposals in recent days.\n\u201cLet me just simply say the maps in New York are not as fair as they could be,\u201d Jeffries told CNN.\nTexas Democrats could protest\nTexas Democrats have limited tools to block Republicans from plowing through with Trump\u2019s plan.\nDemocrats could choose to leave the state during the special session, breaking the necessary quorum and bringing legislative operations to a standstill.\nTexas Democrats employed this approach in 2021, to protest new voting restrictions. After 38 days, enough representatives had trickled back into the state to restore quorum, and Republicans were able to see their measure through.\nContributing: Corpus Christi Caller-Times"
