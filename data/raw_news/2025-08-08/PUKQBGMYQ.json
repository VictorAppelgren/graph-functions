  "content": "One person has been killed after a large wildfire in Keratea, south-east of Athens, spread rapidly, destroying homes and prompting evacuation alerts.\n\nThe fire service says the body of an elderly man was found inside his home in the Togani area, close to where the fire started.\n\nThe blaze broke out shortly after 14:00 local time (11:00 BST) on Friday in the Manoutso area, initially burning through dry grass and plots of land.\n\nAcross Greece, more than 50 agricultural and forest fires have broken out in the past 24 hours - one of the worst days for wildfires this summer.\n\nFanned by winds of up to 80km/h (49mph), the fire near Keratea grew quickly in size and intensity. Thick smoke and strong gusts are hampering firefighting efforts.\n\nEmergency messages from the 112 civil protection service have been sent in quick succession, urging thousands of residents to leave affected areas.\n\nPolice are in place to help with evacuations and have already removed at least 10 people who had refused to leave their homes.\n\nAuthorities say seven areas have so far been evacuated: Synterina, Dimolaki, Maliasteka, Agiasma, Charvalo, Drosia and the settlement of Ari, which has been severely affected, with the fire sweeping through from end to end. Roads have been cut off as flames have crossed fields and reached residential areas.\n\nLavreotiki mayor Dimitris Loukas told public broadcaster ERT that the blaze is \"extremely difficult\" to contain and now stretches more than seven kilometres.\n\nHe said evacuations are under way for all residents in the affected settlements. The fire has moved south from Manoutso towards Drosia, entering a pine forest, with winds now pushing it towards the Anavyssos area.\n\nAuthorities warn that if it is not contained soon, it could grow even larger.\n\nA force of 190 firefighters, seven ground teams, 44 vehicles and the mobile operations centre \"Olympus\" - is battling the flames, supported by 11 aircraft and seven helicopters. Tankers and heavy machinery from the Attica region are also deployed.\n\nFire crews from the Czech Republic and Romania have joined the effort, while army engineering units are providing heavy machinery to assist in containment.\n\nLater on Friday, another large wildfire broke out in Helidoni, in the municipality of Ancient Olympia, western Greece.\n\nRegional authorities have deployed 105 firefighters, four ground teams and 34 vehicles to tackle the blaze there. They are supported from the air by nine aircraft and four helicopters.\n\nVolunteers have also assisted, using water tankers and other machinery.\n\nFire officials say the greatest danger comes from embers carried by the wind, which are igniting multiple spot fires. High-voltage power lines run through the area, and crews are working urgently to stop the flames from reaching them.\n\nEvacuation messages were sent via the 112 civil protection service to residents of Grammatikos, Lantzoi, Agios Georgios Lantzo\u00efou, Pournari and Irakleia in the regional unit of Ilia, advising them to move towards the town of Pyrgos.\n\nFire crews are battling the flames in Grammatikos, Lantzoi, Helidoni and Irakleia, with strong winds driving the fire dangerously close to Pelopio and the archaeological site of Ancient Olympia.\n\nOne person who had been trapped at the Helidoni football ground has been taken to hospital by ambulance with severe burns to their arms.\n\nAround 80 firefighters, three ground teams, 25 vehicles and local authority resources are on scene. Six aircraft and three helicopters are assisting from the air.\n\nAuthorities have warned that the risk of further outbreaks remains severe, particularly in Attica, the Peloponnese and western Greece.\n\nMore on this story\n\u2022 None What to do if your planned holiday destination is affected by wildfires\n\u2022 None Wildfires rage in Greece and Turkey as extreme heat persists",

      "text": "Wildfires rage in Greece and Turkey as extreme heat persists\n- Published\nGreece continued to battle major wildfires across the country amid a severe heatwave, but firefighters have brought many outbreaks under control.\nExtreme heat persisted, with temperatures reaching 42.4C (108.32F) in central Greece on Sunday.\nFirefighters were working on five major fire fronts late on Sunday in the Peloponnese area west of Athens, as well as on the islands of Evia, Kythira and Crete.\nMeanwhile, neighbouring Turkey has recorded its highest ever temperature as fires raged in several regions.\nTurkey's forestry minister, Ibrahim Yumakli, said on Sunday that areas affected by fires were \"going through risky times\" and that he thought it would be several days before they were fully contained.\nOn Saturday, Turkey's environment ministry said meteorologists had recorded a reading of 50.5C in the south-eastern city of Silopi, surpassing the previous heat record of 49.5C.\nFirefighters have faced a four-day battle to contain a fire in the northern Karabuk province, AFP news agency reported on Sunday. On Wednesday, 10 people died fighting a fire in Eskisehir, a province in the north-west, it added.\nSome local authorities have announced restrictions on water consumption, including for the resort of Cesme on Turkey's west coast.\nIn Greece, high winds continued to fan the flames on Sunday. The country formally requested assistance from the EU Civil Protection Mechanism for six firefighting aircraft.\nFire brigade spokesman Vasilios Vathrakoyannis said early on Sunday that the situation had improved after an \"all night battle\".\nClimate crisis and civil protection minister Giannis Kefalogiannis previously said: \"We have injured firefighters, human lives were put at risk, properties have been burned, and forest areas have been destroyed.\"\nIn Kythira, a blaze spread rapidly after breaking out on Saturday morning in the village of Pitsinades. According to initial estimates, about 20% of the island has been affected by the fire.\nNew evacuation alerts were issued on Sunday ordering residents of several villages to leave.\nBy dawn, firefighters were still tackling flare-ups, supported by helicopters and two water-bombing aircraft.\nOn the island of Evia, officials said a blaze near Pissona had got \"out of control\" on Saturday. Six firefighters were taken to hospital with burns and smoke inhalation, while several villages were left without power.\nIn Messinia, a third wildfire broke out in the Polithea area of Trifylia on Saturday morning and intensified later in the day. Officials reported significant damage to homes and agricultural land.\nOn Sunday, Vathrakoyannis said 67 firefighters were attending the Kythira fire and 100 were in Messinia, where an active front remained.\nIn Attica, the region where Athens is, a fire that started in Afidnes on Saturday spread rapidly through Drosopigi, Kryoneri and Agios Stefanos, forcing residents to flee.\nWhile the fire service says the main front had been contained, scattered hotspots continue to burn.\nMeanwhile, in Crete's Chania region, firefighters were battling a 20km wildfire front that swept through forest land, beehives, crops and livestock.\nStrong southwesterly winds were complicating efforts to contain flare-ups, while several villages remained without electricity.\nLast month, fires on Greece's fifth-biggest island Chios, in the northern Aegean, destroyed 4,700 hectares (11,600 acres) of land.\nEarlier in July, a wildfire on the island of Crete forced the evacuation of 5,000 tourists.\nHave you been affected by the wildfires in Greece?

Specialist firefighting planes and helicopters are also in use.\nThe Dardanelles links the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara. Together with the Bosporus Strait, it serves as a vital route for commercial shipping between Europe and Asia.\nNearly 46,000 vessels crossed the Dardanelles in 2024, according to official data.\nStrong winds fanned the wildfires, helping them spread in hot dry weather, local officials said. Efforts to extinguish the blazes from \"both the air and ground\" were ongoing, Canakkale's provincial governor - quoted in Turkiye Today - said on Friday.\nCanakkale's main airport is closed to passenger flights, but firefighting and search and rescue aircraft are still operating from there.\nHundreds of wildfires have broken out across Turkey this summer, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes.\nIn July, at least 10 forestry and rescue workers were killed while battling wildfires in the country's central Eskisehir province.\nRelated topics\n- Published27 July"

      "text": "What to do if your planned holiday destination is affected by wildfires\n- Published\nIt's been a scorching summer so far in parts of Europe, and with it has come an outbreak of wildfires - and warnings of more.\nMainland Greece, some Greek islands, Turkey, France and the Balkans have all been affected in recent weeks. This has come alongside a heatwave - with 50.5C recorded in Silopi, Turkey in late July, and 44C in both Athens and Cyprus.\nSo what should you do if you have a holiday booked for one of these destinations?\nCrucially, the Foreign Office says it's safe to travel, external to all of them - for now.\nBut if you're worried your holiday might still be subject to delays or cancellations - or you're thinking of cancelling it yourself - BBC News has spoken to a range of experts to look at where you stand.\nIf it's safe to travel but you'd prefer not to, what can you do?\nIf you're concerned your planned getaway may be prone to wildfires and you no longer want to go - say because a wildfire has happened near your resort, even if it hasn't directly damaged it - you may have options.\nSome travel insurance providers do allow you to buy additional coverage in the event of natural catastrophes like wildfires, should they occur near your holiday destination - such as within a 20km radius.\nBut if you have not paid for this additional cover and decided that you no longer want to travel, or wish to come home early, and the Foreign Office says it is safe to travel, then you likely won't be able to claim for the costs of cancellation via insurance.\n\"There needs to be reasonable evidence as to why you can't go [or need to leave],\" explains Rhys Jones. \"I think uneasiness or unhappiness about the country [isn't enough].\"\nDuring the Rhodes wildfires in 2023, Jet2 and Tui cancelled a raft of flights but Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways largely continued running. Some airlines cancelled their package holidays, but not their flights.\nIn this case - and with any similar situations this summer - the usual advice is to chat to your airline and hotel, as applicable, because bespoke solutions may be offered for your circumstances.\nClaiming on travel insurance\nAccording to European Commission data, there has been a 13% increase since last week in the total area burnt by wildfires, with more than 290,000 hectacres burnt so far this year in Europe - more than double the figure at the same time last year.\nIf you have travel insurance then most disruption to your trip caused by wildfires should be covered under your standard policy, says Rhys Jones, a travel insurance specialist at GoCompare.\n\"Any sort of curtailment or cancellation of your trip as a result of wildfires - whether that be you can't travel to your destination or you have to come home early - should be covered.\"\nCosts imposed due to other emergency measures such as evacuation, relocation or medical expenses should also be included, he adds. In Crete early last month, 5,000 people, many tourists, were temporarily evacuated during wildfires.\nUnder a standard policy, Mr Jones says there usually needs to be official advice not to travel from the Foreign Office or another authority, to make a successful insurance claim for a cancellation.\nBut some travel insurance providers will cover you if you decide against embarking on your trip before the Foreign Office issues such advice, explains Jo Rhodes, a travel specialist at Which?\n\"For example, if travel has been disrupted or the specific area you're staying in is being affected, the best thing to do is to contact the insurer to check where you stand - and make sure you do this before cancelling any bookings.\"\nWhat if you don't have travel insurance?\nAround one in four Britons who went on an overseas holiday in the last 12 months did so without travel insurance, according to research published by The Travel Association (ABTA), in May.\n\"If you have no insurance but your holiday provider or airline has cancelled bookings, you may still be eligible for a refund from these companies,\" Jo Rhodes says.\nHolidaymakers often look out for package holidays which are Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Atol) protected - but this is not a form of travel insurance.\nThe Atol scheme only protects you if the company providing your holiday goes bust. They will help you get home if you're already aboard a flight, or make a claim for a refund if you are yet to travel.\nThe scheme does not allow you to claim compensation for a cancelled trip or flight, or delays, caused by wildfires.\nWhere you stand with your airline\nYou're covered by UK law if you're departing from a UK airport on any airline, or arriving in the EU on a UK airline, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says, external.\nThis means airlines must provide you with care and assistance if your flight is delayed by two or three hours depending on the distance - including supplying food and drink vouchers and a refund on phone call costs, if necessary.\nAnd, the CAA explains, if your flight is cancelled and rescheduled to another day, your airline must provide accommodation and transport to it.\nHowever, you're unlikely to get compensation for wildfire or extreme heat-related disruption, because that would probably be considered an \"extraordinary circumstance\" so would not be classed as the airline's fault.\nIf you're delayed by more than five hours and you no longer wish to travel, you may be able to get a refund from your airline though, according to the CAA.\nThe body makes clear that if your flight is cancelled, you might have to wait a while but your airline is required to get you to your destination.\nMore Weekend Picks\n- Published13 July\n- Published17 May\n- Published11 August 2024"
