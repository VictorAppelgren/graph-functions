  "title": "Autonomous Driving Startup Nuro Gains Nvidia As An Investor In $97M Series E Extension",
  "description": "Mountain View, California-based Nuro, a developer of autonomous driving technology and software, announced on Thursday that it has raised $97 million in a Series E extension at a $6 billion valuation.",
  "content": "Nuro, a developer of autonomous driving technology and software, has raised $97 million in a Series E extension at a $6 billion valuation, the company announced on Thursday.\n\nThe financing builds upon the April news that Nuro had raised $106 million in the first tranche of that Series E.\n\nThe $6 billion valuation represents a decrease from the reported $8.6 billion Nuro was valued at in 2021 after raising a $600 million Series D led by Tiger Global Management.\n\nIn total, the Mountain View, California-based company says it has raised over $2.3 billion in funding since its 2016 inception.\n\nNotably, the new round of funding included participation from Uber, returning backer Baillie Gifford, and new investors Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Nvidia and Pledge Ventures.\n\nNuro says the new capital will go toward the scaling of its \u201cAI-first\u201d autonomous technology as well as the growth of its commercial partnerships.\n\nIn recent years, Nuro faced some major challenges, including slashing its workforce and changing its business strategy, moving away from its delivery vehicles for packages to now licensing its autonomous driving software.\n\nThe move seems to have been a wise one so far.\n\nIn July, the company announced a partnership with Lucid and Uber to launch a \u201cnext-generation\u201d global robotaxi service.\n\n\u201cThe closing of our Series E reinforces the strong conviction our investors and strategic partners have in Nuro\u2019s technology, our scalable approach to commercialization, and our vision for the future of autonomy,\u201d said Dave Ferguson, Nuro\u2019s co-founder and president, in a blog post.\n\nFunding to autonomous driving tech bounced back in 2024, with Waymo\u2019s massive $5.6 billion round led by Alphabet significantly helping the total reach $12.6 billion, per Crunchbase data. In 2023 that number was only $5.9 billion. So far this year, funding is trending far lower than last year \u2014 with just over $2 billion flowing into autonomous driving tech startups.",

      "text": "Nuro Founder\u2019s message to employees\nThe following was an email sent out to Nuro employees earlier today by our founders Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson.\n______________\nDear Nurons,\nToday we\u2019re announcing the most difficult decision we\u2019ve had to make since we founded Nuro 6 years ago. We are reducing the size of our team by roughly 20%, which equates to around 300 Nurons. You will all receive an email shortly letting you know if you are impacted by this layoff and with information on next steps.\nAs co-founders, we\u2019ve repeatedly said that building this team has been our proudest accomplishment to date \u2014 this remains as true today as ever. We owe all Nuro\u2019s progress to our team. Each and every one of you have made important contributions to this company, and saying goodbye to talented Nurons is not a decision we have taken lightly. For those of you leaving Nuro, we are very sorry for this outcome \u2014 this is not the experience we wanted to create for you. We made this call and take full responsibility for today\u2019s circumstances.\nWe want to share as much as we can about the context and the why behind our decision, what we are doing to support those who are leaving, and details of what will happen next.\nFirst, we\u2019d like to share what led to this and what mistakes we made. The world has changed significantly in the past twelve months. Late 2021 represented one of the strongest fundraising environments in history. We saw an abundant supply of capital for deep tech companies and almost all companies were aggressively hiring and expanding. In that environment, we determined it made sense to invest heavily across the board and grow our team rapidly.\nBut 2022 has brought a variety of macroeconomic challenges \u2014 geopolitical uncertainty, energy crises, persistent inflation, and an impending US recession, among others. The market has gotten ugly. This stark shift requires us to respond decisively and we made the decision to extend our runway well into 2025 to ensure Nuro will steadfastly weather this market downturn. We have dug into company spending and cut back across the board. Laying off team members is always the last resort, but unfortunately it was needed after other options were exhausted. This result is on us; we doubled the size of our team in less than two years and significantly increased our operating expenses, assuming the funding environment would remain strong. This was a mistake.\nToday our focus is on those who are impacted. We want to be clear that these reductions are not a reflection of the work of impacted individuals. You have all made important contributions to Nuro, contributions that made the company what it is today and will continue to shape its future. We are so grateful for that.\nWhile there is no good way to do a layoff, our aim is to execute this as respectfully as we can to honor the strong team members who are leaving us. All departing Nurons will receive support and compensation that includes:\n- Severance: We will offer all impacted Nurons 12 weeks\u2019 pay, and up to 14 weeks for employees with 2+ years of service.\n- Bonus: We will pay departing Nurons their eligible 2022 performance based bonus payouts (prorated for those who started after Oct 2021).\n- Equity: We will waive the one year vesting cliff for impacted employees and accelerate their vesting schedules to January 17, 2023.\n- Healthcare: We will fully subsidize 100% of COBRA healthcare premiums (including families) through March 31, 2023. This will cover access to Lyra.\n- Career Support: We will provide career transition support and create an alumni list for those who opt in. All departing Nurons will also be able to keep their laptops and ergonomic equipment.\n- Immigration Support: Visa holders will receive some notice period to ease this transition and if applicable, travel assistance.\nThose impacted will hear directly from their org leader and HRBPs and will have the opportunity to meet with a team member 1:1 to receive support and get any outstanding questions answered.\nGiven the magnitude of this decision, those of you who are staying are probably wondering how this affects our progress going forward. The two of us have been working in this industry for about two decades now, and we are more convinced than ever that Nuro is on the right path to commercialize autonomous vehicles at scale. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Nuro has hit the major milestones we planned for this year and our pace of progress is accelerating. Our robots are now driving more miles each week (without drivers or follow vehicles) in Houston, Palo Alto, and Mountain View than we did in all of 2021. We launched a commercial service with our new partner UberEats just a couple of months after the partnership became official. Our manufacturing team, partners, and suppliers around the world are adding more robots to our fleet every week, including our third generation vehicle.\nWe have always been hyper focused on commercializing AV technology. It is why we are delivering goods, not passengers, and why we have always pushed for capital efficiency. With this step we are doubling down on that. We still have over a billion dollars on our balance sheet and will deploy it thoughtfully. With our newly extended 2025 runway we now have the resources \u2014 and renewed focus \u2014 to scale an incredible, efficient service for our partners, and be less distracted by noise in the market. And we\u2019ll share more on this soon.\nWe started Nuro because we believe that robotics has the potential to significantly improve everyday life. What we\u2019re doing here matters. It is why we have all dedicated our most precious resource \u2014 our time, ourselves \u2014 to this effort. And we will continue to do everything we can to realize this mission and honor the contributions of every Nuron.\nJZ & Dave"

      "text": "In this article:\nBy Jane Lanhee Lee\n(Reuters) - Autonomous delivery vehicle maker Nuro raised $600 million in its latest funding round, the Silicon Valley-based startup said on Tuesday, bringing on board Alphabet Inc's Google as an investor.\nThe funding round, led by Tiger Global Management, lifted Nuro's valuation to $8.6 billion from $5 billion previously, according to a person close to the deal.\nToyota Motor Corp's Woven Capital, SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 1, Kroger Co. were among other investors.\nSelf-driving startups are racing to build war chests to develop and commercialize technology, an expensive and time-consuming process. Alphabet's self-driving unit Waymo in June raised $2.5 billion.\nNuro, whose R2 unit has no pedals or steering wheel and only room for packages, said it has signed a five-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to support self-driving simulation and data management.\nGoogle Cloud said it was also looking to help Nuro optimise how it makes deliveries for retailers and other businesses, with the aim of transforming local commerce together.\nNuro's founders, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, both worked on Google's self-driving car project, later spun out as Waymo, before launched Nuro.\nNuro's R2 has been tested in several cities, including Houston in Texas, Phoenix in Arizona, and Mountain View in California.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave Nuro approval in February last year to deploy up to 5,000 R2 vehicles on public roads over two years. The company has not disclosed the number of R2s on the road.\n(Reporting By Jane Lanhee Lee; editing by Jane Wardell)"
