      "feedback": "This draft has breadth but lacks a crisp, testable causal chain and precise 3–6‑month sequencing; tighten by (a) anchoring the AI leadership thesis to explicit, monitorable catalysts (Nvidia’s AI demand, Wedbush AI‑30 changes adding CrowdStrike/Roblox/GE Vernova/Nebius and removing Adobe/C3.ai as evidence of core AI infra leadership; STBVARD8F) and (b) tying M&A/ Costa Coffee context to a measurable pace of deal activity and its macro‑growth implications (Costa sale chatter, slow M&A cadence in 2024–2025 from the same piece). Strengthen the transmission by explicitly linking these to market moves: AI leadership pressure on large‑cap multiples vs. value/defensive reversion as IPOs and capital allocation shift; cite IPO cadence (95 deals in 2025 raising $12.9B vs 73 deals in 2024/$16B) and Russell 2000 dynamics (lowest valuation vs S&P since 2008, ~4,300 small‑caps vs ~7,000 historically; Q7VVGNSQE). Tie to value/quality tilts via IUSV’s profile (large‑cap, low volatility with Services and Software & Programming exposure) from the Validea report (4661GWFP7). Explicitly anchor the dividend‑stock framework to the concrete stock list and yields from The Motley Fool/MarketWatch material (TXN, AXP, SBUX, Alphabet, LLY, HON, PG, XOM, SO, MAA, SHW in YX2J8NHZ1; KO commentary in the same ecosystem) to justify ballast allocations (YX2J8NHZ1; 4661GWFP7). For 3–6 months, present a tight scenario map: Base Case (AI leadership persists but grows conservatively; small‑cap fundamentals improve modestly with IPO flow rising toward the 95‑deal pace; IUSV/low‑vol/value tilt outperforms modestly), Alt 1 (AI leadership broadens with greater dispersion; cyclical/infrastructure/touchpoint names benefit; HK/PG/HON/XOM crowd leading), Alt 2 (consumption/retail risk intensifies; KO/consumer staples underperform without durable capital returns). Add explicit triggers and invalidations for each: Trigger: IPO count sustained above ~90–100 deals in 2–3 months; Invalidation: IPOs stall or AI leadership loses momentum (cite 95 IPOs/12.9B vs 73/16B; STBVARD8F; Q7VVGNSQE). Watch‑list signals: accelerations in IPO flow; Russell 2000 balance‑sheet improvement and earnings resilience; IUSV relative performance versus broad market (Q7VVGNSQE; 4661GWFP7). Quantify where possible (cite exact numbers and ranges; e.g., 95 deals/$12.9B in 2025; 4,300 vs 7,000 company universe; KO forward dividend yield ~2.89% and P/E ~25x from the KO data; 4661GWFP7), and reconcile potential conflicts by stating a clear allocation stance under each path. Finally, deliver a tightened narrative with a clear base case probability, 1–2 alternative paths, a concise risk/watch‑list, and a confident, 3–6‑month expiry with an explicit end‑state.",
