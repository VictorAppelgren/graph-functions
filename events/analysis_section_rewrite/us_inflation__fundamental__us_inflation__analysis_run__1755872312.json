      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced depth and clarity in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how inflationary pressures from tariffs directly impact consumer behavior and corporate pricing strategies, using specific examples or data points. Additionally, ensure that the discussion of structural regimes includes more concrete first-principles analysis, such as referencing real rate differentials or terms of trade, to ground your arguments in economic fundamentals. The section on risks should be more specific, identifying particular catalysts or triggers that could lead to a sharper economic slowdown or a Fed policy shift. Lastly, improve citation density by integrating more direct references to the source material throughout the analysis, ensuring that all critical sources are covered and conflicts reconciled. Aim for a more concise conclusion that succinctly summarizes the base case and key risks while maintaining a confident tone.",
