  "content": "PLANO, TX / ACCESS Newswire / August 6, 2025 / BGSF, Inc. ( ), a leading provider of workforce solutions through the Property Management segment, today reported financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2025.\n\u2022 Revenues were $23.5 million for Q2, compared to $20.9 million for Q1 . The 12.6% increase from Q1 is primarily driven by increased billed hours from seasonal demand.\n\u2022 Gross profit was $8.4 million for Q2, up from $7.6 million in Q1, primarily due to higher sales.\n\u2022 Net loss was $4.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share for Q2, compared to a net loss of $2.2 million in Q1 or $0.21 per diluted share.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA1 loss was $1.1 million (4.9% of revenues) in Q2 compared to $1.0 million (5.4% of revenues) in Q1.\n\u2022 Adjusted EPS1 loss was $0.19 for Q2, compared with Adjusted EPS1 loss of $0.11 for Q1.\n\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n\n(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)\n\n1 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures as defined and reconciled below.\n\nInterim Co-Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Keith Schroeder, said, \u201cThe proposed sale of BGSF\u2019s Professional division to INSPYR is moving along as planned, a proxy statement was filed on July 25th to call for a special meeting of shareholders on September 4th to vote on the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, we will perform under a Transition Service Agreement, or TSA, for up to six months or longer to help INSPYR stand up the business in their operating environment. We will be paid for those services, and we also plan to continue reducing our overhead costs to align with a smaller, Property Management-focused company. We expect our financial results, post-close, to be noisy for a couple of quarters.\u201d\n\nInterim Co-Chief Executive Officer and Property Management President, Kelly Brown, commented, \u201cOur second quarter Sales from continuing operations, or the Property Management business, of $23.5 million, improved sequentially on seasonality from the first quarter by 12.6%, and declined from last year\u2019s quarter of 8.6%. Gross margins were relatively stable at 35.8% for the second quarter. In addition to implementing cost reduction measures that Keith addressed, we are also re-baselining Property Management costs to align more closely with revenue and investing in strategic initiatives to drive revenue and profitability in our business. Specifically, we are implementing AI-powered sales and recruiting tools that are expected to be operational by the middle of the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nBGSF will discuss its second quarter 2025 financial results during a conference call and webcast at 9:00 a.m. ET on August 7, 2025.

To help the readers understand our financial performance, we supplements our GAAP financial results with Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS.\n\nA non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company\u2019s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income per diluted share, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or measures of our liquidity. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are useful performance measures and are used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. In addition, the financial covenants in our credit agreement are based on EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement.\n\nWe define \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, costs associated with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives (\u201cstrategic alternatives review\u201d), software as a service costs, and certain non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation expense, as well as certain specific events that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance.\n\nWe define \u201cAdjusted EPS\u201d as diluted earnings per share eliminating amortization expense of intangible assets from acquisitions, the strategic alternatives review, software as a service costs, and certain non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation expense, as well as certain specific events that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance, net of the respective income tax effect.\n\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n2 We capitalize direct costs incurred in cloud computing implementation from hosting arrangements, which are reported as a Software as a service and are expensed as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\n2 We capitalize direct costs incurred in cloud computing implementation from hosting arrangements, which are reported as a Software as a service and are expensed as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses.",
