      "feedback": "The draft is on the right track but needs tighter focus, stronger evidence, and clearer causal mapping to the S&P 500 over the 3–6‑month horizon. 1) Add explicit dates for the key catalysts: the September 5 Q3 jobs report, the Fed’s September policy meeting (expected cut), and the next CPI/PCE releases (Oct 2025). 2) Quantify the baseline S&P 500 pullback as a 5–10 % decline (mid‑point 7.5 %) if tech earnings falter and the Fed cuts rates, citing the 40 % top‑10 weight (FAN5RYW6T) and the 2.7 % CPI/2.9 % core PCE (FAN5RYW6T). 3) Explicitly link the dollar’s 2 % August decline (Z7O1DCHS7) to a modest equity lift (+0.5–1 %) via improved export competitiveness and risk‑on sentiment, and note that a steeper 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (57 bp, Z7O1DCHS7) could drag the index by 1–2 %. 4) Provide an alternative scenario: if the labor market strengthens (e.g., Q3 jobs growth > 200k) and inflation moderates (CPI < 2.5 %), the Fed may cut less aggressively, flattening the curve and keeping the S&P near or slightly above current levels (±2 %). 5) Add a watch‑list with explicit dates: Sept 5 jobs, Sept 20 Fed minutes, Oct 15 CPI/PCE, weekly 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, any Cook lawsuit updates. 6) Assign a confidence rating (moderate‑high) and justify it with the convergence of multiple catalysts. 7) Ensure every claim has an inline citation (e.g., (FAN5RYW6T), (Z7O1DCHS7)); remove or re‑link any sentence that drifts from the S&P 500 focus (e.g., generic statements about “dollar index” without tying to equity impact). 8) Tighten the narrative to a single causal chain: tech earnings → index drag → dollar move → equity valuation effect, with magnitude ranges and catalyst windows. This will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, provide actionable signals, and align with the 3–6‑month horizon.",
