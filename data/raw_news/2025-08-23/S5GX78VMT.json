  "content": "Kelsey Birch remembers the crushing pressure, the sharp jerks, and the feeling of hands inside her abdomen. \"I felt like I was being torn apart,\" she said. \"I couldn't handle it.\"Birch, a then 28-year-old emergency dispatcher in Colorado, hadn't gone into labor expecting surgery. She was healthy. Her first pregnancy had been going well, and her full-term baby was positioned face down \u2014 an ideal candidate for a vaginal birth. As her contractions grew stronger, a delivery room nurse urged Birch to get an epidural before the hospital anesthesiologist finished his shift. Birch agreed.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that a woman with an epidural in first-time labor push for up to four hours. Birch pushed for just over two before a doctor intervened. Her labor had failed to progress, her medical records noted, so, like one in three American women who give birth, Birch underwent a cesarean section.The half-hour surgery began months of recovery. For weeks, Birch struggled to hold and breastfeed her newborn daughter. Her incision site was searingly painful; first as a fresh wound and again as it healed, scar tissue adhering to skin and muscle. Like many women who undergo a C-section, she learned to cope with intrusive memories of the surgery.C-sections are now the most common inpatient surgery in America. Business Insider analyzed years of hospital delivery data from Florida, Mississippi, and Iowa and found that C-section rates can differ sharply between hospitals just miles apart \u2014 even when caring for similar, low-risk patients. Those gaps, experts say, point to how a hospital's policies, culture, and financial incentives can push surgery rates higher, helping explain why the US consistently performs far more C-sections than global health authorities consider necessary.In 1970, just over 5% of babies in the US were delivered by C-section nationwide \u2014 too low to protect some women and their babies. That rate tripled within a decade. Now, for nearly 20 years, over 30% of babies in the United States have been born by C-section, around double the rate the World Health Organization says is \"ideal\" for maternal and infant health. US doctors perform these surgeries 60% more frequently than doctors in France, and nearly double the rate of Finland and Sweden.Many of them, maternal health experts told Business Insider, are medically unnecessary. Federal health agencies consider women with low-risk pregnancies \u2014 those who are pregnant for the first time, are at full term, are not delivering twins, and whose babies are head-down rather than breech \u2014 the least likely group to require surgery to safely deliver their babies. Yet more than a quarter of those women delivered by C-section in the US in 2023, the most recently available year with national data.One large study estimates that as many as 19% of all births should be C-sections to protect women and their babies, leaving as many as 13% possibly performed needlessly in the US.That suggests roughly one in 10 pregnant American women \u2014 nearly half a million women each year \u2014 are operated on unnecessarily, undergoing major abdominal surgeries that carry a higher risk of hemorrhage, blood clots, and infection, and leave women more likely to develop dangerous complications in their future pregnancies.It's not because women are asking for more C-sections. Only an estimated 2.5% of US babies are born by elective C-section each year. Instead, experts say, the reason behind the high C-section rate largely comes down to the structure of the American medical system.C-sections are more profitable, predictable, and are perceived to be more protective against lawsuits than vaginal births, according to experts and multiple studies. They say health systems looking to keep operating rooms full, revenue up, and liability risk minimized are indirectly incentivized to keep surgery rates high.Put plainly, a high C-section rate may just be better for business.C-sections are often critical, sometimes lifesaving procedures.In medical emergencies, like when the placenta completely blocks the cervix or an umbilical cord slips down past the baby, a C-section is mandatory. Failure to promptly perform the surgery can disable or kill the woman, her baby, or both. Other factors \u2014 including a pregnant woman's age, whether she's obese, or if she's diagnosed with diabetes or pre-eclampsia \u2014 all increase the chance that a C-section is the safest way to deliver a baby.To deliver a baby by C-section, a surgeon dissects through seven layers of body tissue: skin, fat, fascia, muscle, peritoneum, uterus, and amniotic sac. Doctors first use a scalpel; later, they may use their fingers or a blunt tool. Like any abdominal surgery, it also presents immediate risks, including infections, hemorrhages, blood clots, or injury to other organs.The risks increase with additional C-sections, and a woman is far more likely to have another C-section once she's had her first. In 2021, 86% of women who previously had a C-section underwent the surgery again to deliver their next baby. While studies show that as many as 80% of women who have undergone a prior C-section can safely deliver their next baby vaginally, many hospitals nationwide ban women who have had a C-section from attempting a later vaginal birth, citing safety and liability concerns. Each additional surgery will increase her risk of developing severe complications, like placenta accreta, which almost always requires a hysterectomy to prevent hemorrhaging.These complications can sometimes turn deadly. While rare, the United States has the highest rate of maternal mortality among high-income countries \u2014 18.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2023 \u2014 and a woman who receives a C-section is up to five times more likely to die due to pregnancy-related causes than a woman who delivers vaginally.Even when the surgery goes as expected, some women describe the experience as extreme, even traumatic. Women are anesthetized, but most choose to remain conscious to witness the birth of their child. While some women who spoke with Business Insider said their surgeries were unremarkable and felt little of the procedure, others told Business Insider they still felt the snagging pull of the scalpel, intense pressure, and sometimes shocking pain. Their memories of the surgery are punctuated with specific detail: their arms held outstretched, pinned in restraints secured to the operating table; their bodies trembling; and their newborns held amid IV lines and the surgical drape.After a C-section, some women endure weeks or months of painful recovery, much longer than women who deliver vaginally. Women told Business Insider they struggled to breastfeed, shower, and get out of bed to care for their newborns. Some suffered painful infections along their 4- to 6-inch surgical incisions. Others weathered panic attacks, nightmares, and lingering anxiety.Doctors delivering babies have to make tough calls. If a fetal heart rate monitor alerts that a baby is in distress, or if a woman's labor is so prolonged that she or her baby is at risk of suffering severe injury, a doctor might feel compelled to intervene.Even if the medical necessity of C-section is ambiguous, \"I can't really gamble,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Langen, an OB-GYN and a clinical associate professor at the University of Michigan who studies C-section rates. Doctors may choose to perform a C-section because \"it's devastating when a baby is born and isn't doing well,\" she said. \"You keep thinking, 'Is there something else I could have done?'\"The health and safety of a woman and her baby aren't always the only influences at play.Controlling for a constellation of factors \u2014 hospital obstetric care levels, delivery volume, urban or rural location, maternal age, race, health, and income \u2014 multiple studies show that one of the strongest predictors of whether a woman will get a C-section is which hospital she delivers in.Business Insider requested data on hospital delivery data from all 50 states and DC, and analyzed data from three states that responded first to the request or had already published the data publicly: Florida, Mississippi, and Iowa. Business Insider's analysis reveals huge variations in C-section rates from one neighboring hospital to another \u2014 suggesting a woman's chance of undergoing a C-section is affected by her choice between two close-by hospitals.A 15-minute drive is enough to swing outcomes. In 2019, the average rate of C-sections at one Palm Beach County hospital in Florida was 26% higher than at a hospital less than 5 miles away in a similarly majority white, wealthy area. Between 2010 and 2019, Business Insider found similar instances in Broward, Duval, Miami-Dade, and at least five other Florida counties. The hospitals all had similar levels of obstetric care and numbers of babies delivered.Similar patterns were found in Mississippi, where C-section rates are among the highest in the country, as well as in Iowa, where C-section rates are among the lowest nationwide. Doctors at a hospital in northwest Iowa, performed surgeries on women who were pregnant for the first time at a rate 65% higher than doctors at a comparable hospital 15 minutes away, according to Business Insider's analysis of aggregate five-year hospital birth data from 2019 to 2023.For C-sections performed on low-risk pregnancies, differences in hospital rates may be more telling, experts told Business Insider, as surgeries performed in this category are more likely to have been medically unnecessary.In Mississippi, which has the highest rate of C-sections on low-risk pregnancies in the country, some hospitals had low-risk pregnancy cesarean delivery rates that swung as low as 14%. Doctors at other hospitals performed C-sections on 45% of all women with low-risk pregnancies, according to the analysis of data from 2022.How a hospital operates \u2014 its workplace culture, administrators' priorities, and the type and number of staff employed, particularly nurses or midwives \u2014 can dramatically impact how many cesarean deliveries its doctors perform, said Dr. Emily White VanGompel, a family medicine doctor and professor at the University of Illinois Chicago who studies how organizations impact C-section rates.Hospital administrators and care staff can foster cultures more supportive of vaginal birth, White VanGompel said. Conversely, they can also implement policies and care standards that cause doctors to intervene more in a woman's labor.Some hospitals that treat women with high-risk pregnancies may require a high C-section rate to most safely deliver their patients' babies. A risk-adverse hospital may also lead doctors to perform more medical interventions in part to minimize its risk of a lawsuit, said Louise Roth, a sociology professor at the University of Arizona who studies how organizations and medical malpractice influence maternal health, including C-section rates.Doctors may then practice medicine in ways that evidence-based studies show can increase the chance of a C-section: induce labor more often, continuously monitor more fetal heart rates in low-risk pregnancies, and interrupt women who push for more than a few hours \u2014 all procedures that are more insulating in the case of a lawsuit, Roth said.OB-GYNs are among the doctors most likely to face a legal threat at least once in their career, a 2023 study found, and a lawsuit filed over the serious harm or death of a baby can result in tens of millions of dollars in jury awards.\"People often will teach young obstetricians that you don't get sued for doing a C-section, you get sued for not doing a C-section,\" Langen said.Roth said doing more also satisfies another hospital demand: billing more procedures and garnering more reimbursements.\"Intervening more almost always means a C-section,\" Roth said, \"But less intervention means less money.\"In Kelsey Birch's case, the hospital where she delivered disclosed in a 2025 survey that it had an average C-section rate 22% higher than the state average.A C-section is major surgery. It's also lucrative.Providers in the 1970s and 1980s responded to \"market shocks\" \u2014 dips in the birthrate that undercut their profits \u2014 by performing more highly reimbursed C-sections, a pioneering 1996 study found. A 2017 study revealed that California women, meanwhile, were 12% more likely to receive a C-section if their doctor was reimbursed just $420 more for the surgery than for a vaginal delivery.On average, US insurers in 2020 paid $17,103 for a C-section and $11,453 for vaginal birth, according to one 2022 study. Physicians were paid about 16% more, on average, for a C-section than a vaginal delivery, according to a 2015 study. Because a C-section takes much less time, it's more cost-effective for both providers and hospitals.While researchers in the early 2000s found that pregnant women who are older, obese, or who have other preexisting health issues undergo C-sections at higher rates, more recent studies have since found that controlling for these and many other patient factors doesn't eliminate the wide swings in C-section rates between hospitals or explain the high C-section rate nationwide.Research has repeatedly shown the connection between profits and surgical deliveries. Women who gave birth at for-profit hospitals were more likely to deliver by C-section; women were more likely to undergo a C-section at hospitals that reap higher profits from each C-section than hospitals where the procedure is less lucrative; and Florida obstetricians increased the number of C-sections they performed after their practices were acquired by management companies that prioritized increasing practice revenue.Some women are more likely to get the surgery. Black women nationwide undergo C-sections at higher rates than white women. Doctors in hospitals across New Jersey, for example, were much more likely to give Black women unnecessary C-sections to fill empty operating rooms and maximize payouts.Directly incentivizing doctors to perform more C-sections is illegal, but other incentives like bonus payments for bringing in more money to the practice or mandatory practice revenue thresholds can influence doctors to increase the number of surgeries they perform, said Ambar La Forgia, an associate professor at Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkley, and the author of the Florida study.\"It's a known fact that C-sections reimburse more highly than a vaginal birth, but they're also easier to do and easier to schedule,\" said La Forgia, making them attractive procedures to healthcare companies looking to boost their bottom line.In some cases, overuse becomes criminal. In January 2025, the Department of Justice accused Chesapeake Regional Medical Center in Southeast Virginia of fraudulently billing for unnecessary procedures, including C-sections tied to the hospital's former chief obstetrician, Javaid Perwaiz. Prosecutors said Perwaiz routinely falsified records to justify early labor inductions and C-sections timed to his weekend surgery block. The pattern was so blatant that hospital staff nicknamed the resulting NICU admissions the \"Perwaiz special,\" according to a federal indictment.The indictment called the fraud \"patently obvious\" and an \"open secret\" that was documented repeatedly to hospital leadership and ignored. The hospital turned a blind eye, the indictment said, because Perwaiz's actions reaped a financial reward.The hospital had been aware of red flags around Perwaiz's history for decades, the indictment charged. Following Perwaiz's federal tax fraud conviction in 1996, another obstetrician at Chesapeake Regional warned the Virginia medical board that \"unnecessary gynecologic surgery is a growth industry in Chesapeake,\" according to the indictment, and that Perwaiz might be incentivized to perform even more surgeries to pay off his fraud debts.Around the same time, the indictment charged, Chesapeake Regional's president wrote a letter to the medical board supporting the reinstatement of Perwaiz's medical license, citing his value to the hospital's bottom line.Perwaiz was charged in a separate criminal case in 2019 and convicted in 2021 for performing medically unnecessary surgeries, including C-sections. He was sentenced to 59 years in prison. His lawyers declined to comment on Business Insider's reporting.Dr. Nick Oberheiden, Chesapeake Regional's attorney, told Business Insider that the hospital denied any wrongdoing. \"We are confident that the court and a jury will find, based on the facts, the law, and the evidence, that Dr. Perwaiz was the sole wrongdoer,\" Oberheiden said.The case against Chesapeake Regional is ongoing.The C-section rate at each individual hospital isn't an intractable problem, said White VanGompel, the family medicine doctor. Since hospital policies, administration priorities, and staff culture have so much bearing on increasing C-section rates, she told Business Insider, changing policy, priorities, and culture can also lower them.In a 2024 study, White VanGompel and co-authors studied hospitals in California and Florida that focused on safely lowering their C-section rate and managed to reduce cesarean births by 5% for at least 18 months.They found the most successful hospitals had strong leadership support, communication between care teams supportive of vaginal delivery, and a culture that empowered nurses to advocate for their patients without retribution. (Nationwide, hospitals with more nursing staff or that employ midwives are also associated with lower C-section rates.)California also shows what's possible at the state level. In 2015, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative launched a campaign with policy recommendations, financial incentives, and new public transparency requirements \u2014 including publicly publishing all hospitals' annual low-risk C-section rates \u2014 aimed at lowering low-risk pregnancy C-section rates.In 2014, California's low-risk pregnancy C-section rate mirrored the country's nationwide: 26%. Five years later, the rate had declined to 22.8% \u2014 a 12% drop.States like Wisconsin, Illinois, and New Jersey have also seen success with initiatives meant to lower C-section rates.These kinds of state policies and hospital-level interventions aren't just niceties, only implemented when it's convenient for providers and hospitals, White VanGompel said.Women's health is at stake, White VanGompel said. \"This is what actually gets results.\"Back in Colorado, Kelsey Birch wrote a complaint letter to the administrator of the hospital where she gave birth. \"I now have a scar on my uterus, which could affect any subsequent pregnancies and births,\" she wrote. She feared her providers had rushed her first with the epidural, and then again as she attempted to give birth vaginally.\"I believe my cesarean could have been avoided.\"Have a tip?
