      "summary": "TKO Group Holdings has doubled its quarterly dividend to $0.76 per share, a $150 million payout, driven by new U.S. media rights deals: a seven‑year, $1.1 billion‑per‑year UFC contract with Paramount Skydance and a five‑year, $1.6 billion WWE deal with ESPN. The move lifts TKO’s dividend yield to 1.64%, above the S&P 500’s 1.2%, and signals confidence in the company’s cash flow. TKO also plans to expand its credit facility by up to $1 billion to support future growth.",
