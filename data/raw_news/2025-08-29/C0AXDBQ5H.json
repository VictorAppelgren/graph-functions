  "description": "UK pharmacies have revealed how much they will be charging for Mounjaro next week.",
  "content": "How much pharmacies will be charging for the 'King Kong' weight loss jab Mounjaro as of Monday has been revealed.\n\nThe manufacturer Eli Lily sparked panic among slimmers earlier this month, when it announced it will more than double the price of the drug in the UK.\n\nThe US pharmaceutical giant revealed the cost would soar from September 1, with the wholesale price of a month's supply of the highest dose rising from \u00a3122 to \u00a3330.\n\nThis led to patients rushing to stockpile months' worth of the jabs which has resulted in some pharmacies running out of stock.\n\nIn response to unprecedented demand, the manufacturer temporarily paused shipments of the jab to the UK.\n\nWhile not all pharmacies have shared their new prices, or vowed to keep prices as they are for existing customers until stocks run out, others have revealed what people can expect to pay for future doses.\n\nThe cheapest option from our list for all doses is online pharmacist Curely who will be offering the lowest dose of 2.5mg for \u00a3136.80 and the highest dose for \u00a3270.\n\nAlthough the most expensive option differs across doses, for the highest dose of 15mg, Boots has the highest price at \u00a3335.\n\nThere also isn't a universal cheapest option as different people will need different doses, and some pharmacies offer bundles.\n\nAnd things could still change, as recently leaked documents seen by Sky News revealed Lilly may be U-turning on their price hike.\n\nThe documents showed the cost of the manufacturer's highest dose will rise to \u00a3247.50\u2014almost \u00a3100 less than planned.\n\nSo, those using the jabs could save more than \u00a380 on the maximum dose, Sky News has reported.\n\nPharmacy leaders said the rebate will 'mitigate some of the impact' of the hike, although patients should 'still anticipate seeing a rise in prices'.\n\nAn Eli Lilly spokesperson said: 'We are working with private providers on commercial arrangements to maintain affordability and expect these to be passed onto patients when the change is effective on 1 September.\n\n'We are already seeing providers respond in different ways to the price change, with a range of options available for eligible patients.'\n\nExperts had feared the looming Mounjaro price hike could drive more people to towards the black market.\n\nOver 18,000 illegal weight-loss and diabetes medications, including fake Mounjaro pens were seized by Border Force at Heathrow between June 2024 and June 2025.\n\nThe data, obtained by the online pharmacy group Chemist4U, showed that smugglers had been stopped at the airport with fake Mounjaro pens hidden on their bodies.\n\nIt is estimated at least half a million NHS patients are prescribed the jabs, and the number of people obtaining them on private prescription are even higher.\n\nIn a bid to tackle the UK's obesity crisis, the government allowed GPs to prescribe the jabs.\n\nStudies have found that they can help obese patients lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a few months.\n\nOfficial guidelines say they should only be given to patients with a body mass index (BMI) over 35 and at least one weight-related problem like high blood pressure.\n\nThose with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service can also use them.\n\nLatest data revealed nearly two-thirds of adults in England are overweight, with more than a quarter\u2014an estimated 14 million people\u2014obese.\n\nThe obesity crisis costs the NHS more than \u00a311 billion a year and the economy billions more in lost productivity and benefits.",

The wholesale price of a month's supply of the highest dose of the drug is expected to rise from \u00a3122 to \u00a3330.

      "text": "U-turn on Mounjaro price hike: drug giant scales back planned rise after backlash - new costs revealed in full\nThe cost of the 'King Kong' weight loss jab Mounjaro will not be as much as first feared, leaked documents have revealed.\nUS pharmaceutical giant Lilly, which manufactures the drug, has reportedly backed down after mounting pressure over its planned price hike.\nUnder plans announced earlier this month, it had said the cost would soar from September 1, with the wholesale price of a month's supply of the highest dose rising from \u00a3122 to \u00a3330.\nEven mid-range doses, such as the 5mg pen, would jump from about \u00a392 to \u00a3180.\nNow, however, documents have shown the cost of the highest dose will rise to \u00a3247.50\u2014almost \u00a3100 less than planned.\nLower doses will get smaller discounts under the new price list.\nIn a statement, Lilly said: 'We are working with private providers on commercial arrangements to maintain affordability and expect these to be passed onto patients when the change is effective on 1 September.\n'We are already seeing providers respond in different ways to the list price change, with a range of options available for eligible patients.'\nEli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company behind the drug, has backed down to mounting pressure over the planned price hike, and the increased cost for the fat jab will now not be as high as previously announced\nIt comes as slimmers have rushed to stockpile months worth of Mounjaro after panic grew over its soaring cost.\nSocial media users have boasted online of getting their hands on months worth of injection pens, to avoid having to pay the new price.\nPharmacies have also warned that patients have been 'Covid-style' panic-buying the drug since the announcement.\nIt has left some experts fearing patients may be tempted by black market sellers who flog the jabs at reduced prices\u2014putting their health at risk.\nMore than 18,000 illegal weight-loss and diabetes medications, including fake Ozempic and Mounjaro pens, were seized by Border Force at Heathrow between June 2024 and June 2025.\nThe data, obtained by the online pharmacy group Chemist4U, showed that smugglers had been stopped at the airport with fake Mounjaro pens hidden on their bodies.\nYesterday, Lilly also announced it was temporarily pausing the supply of Mounjaro to the UK until the price hike is enforced.\nThe US pharmaceutical giant claimed this was to ensure they are not stockpiling at the current lower price.\n| Mounjaro\u00ae\u00bf (tirzepatide) KwikPen\u00ae Dose | Current UK List Price | New UK List Price (From September) |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2.5mg | \u00a392 | \u00a3133 |\n| 5mg | \u00a392 | \u00a3180 |\n| 7.5mg | \u00a3107 | \u00a3255 |\n| 10mg | \u00a3107 | \u00a3255 |\n| 12.5mg | \u00a3122 | \u00a3330 |\n| 15mg | \u00a3122 | \u00a3330 |\nBut health leaders warned the move would further panic patients and threatened to overwhelm pharmacy staff who have already been 'extending opening hours' to provide weight loss jab advice since the price hike announcement.\nDr Leyla Hannbeck, CEO of the Independent Pharmacies Association told the Daily Mail: 'It is completely unacceptable that Eli Lilly has not only decided to cause significant instability by increasing prices with minimal notice, but is now making matters worse by suspending supply until those higher prices take effect in September.\n'Lilly's latest move is throwing the system into chaos.\n'It is utterly wrong that patients are being made to suffer as a result of Eli Lilly's pursuit of profit.\n'There is still time for Eli Lilly to reverse this disastrous decision, and I sincerely urge them to do the right thing.'\nEli Lilly said the UK was one of the first countries to roll out Mounjaro, and the list price had been significantly lower than the European average.\nIn a statement, it said: 'We are now aligning the list price more consistently to ensure fair global contribution to the cost of innovation.'\nAt least half a million NHS patients and some 15million patients in the US are now thought to be using weight-loss jabs, which can help patients lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a few months.\nAnd the numbers using them privately are even higher.\nUnder official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35 and at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, or those who have a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed weight-loss jabs."

The temporary shipment pause and panic buying have highlighted supply\u2011chain fragility, while the revised price of \u00a3247.50 may partially offset the impact. Market participants should watch inflation releases and supply\u2011chain metrics for signs of broader price pressures.",
