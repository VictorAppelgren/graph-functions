      "summary": "Lyft priced a $450 million convertible senior notes offering due 2030, with a conversion rate of 42.517 shares per $1,000, implying a $23.52 conversion price—about a 40% premium to its last sale price. The deal will net roughly $438.8 million, with $37.8 million earmarked for capped call transactions and $95.7 million for share repurchases. Lyft also offered an option for an additional $50 million in notes to qualified institutional buyers, and any proceeds from that option will further fund capped calls. The notes are unsecured, non‑interest‑bearing, and redeemable in cash from September 2028 if the stock meets a performance threshold. The transaction is set to close on September 5, 2024, and Lyft’s shares closed up 0.18% at $16.83 on Nasdaq.",
