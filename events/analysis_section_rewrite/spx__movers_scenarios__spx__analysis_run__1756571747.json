      "feedback": "The draft mixes ETH‑specific dynamics with generic crypto‑market language, diluting the causal chain to the asset in focus (ETH). Remove the “Stable‑coin fee share rise” line – it lacks a clear handle mapping to ETH price and no catalyst window is specified. The “Fed hawkish policy + equity rally reversal” line is too vague; replace it with a concrete path: Fed hawkish stance → higher yields (us10y) → reduced risk‑on equity (ndx) → lower ETH demand (OGK8WLL69). Add a catalyst window: Fed September meeting (2025‑09‑16‑20) and the release of the Fed minutes (2025‑09‑17). For the “Stalled corporate treasury inflows + regulatory setbacks” line, specify the corporate treasury flow data (e.g., Bitmine Immersion’s $45 m purchase) and the regulatory announcement window (Project Crypto and retirement‑plan order updates). Ensure each line maps to at least one canonical handle (e.g., ust10y, ndx, dxy, spx) with a sign and magnitude, and cite the source ID in parentheses. Finally, tighten probabilities: use 70% for the dovish upside, 55% for the hawkish downside, and 45% for the stalled inflows scenario, reflecting the moderate‑high confidence stated in OGK8WLL69.",
