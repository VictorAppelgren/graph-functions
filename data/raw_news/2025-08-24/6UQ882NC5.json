  "content": "More delays are planned for Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s South Park Season 27 after two breaks in the first three weeks.\n\nParker and Stone\u2019s $1.5 billion deal with Paramount Global to produce 50 new episodes of South Park and to make Paramount+ its new streaming home was announced on July 23, just in time for the new season\u2019s cable premiere on Comedy Central later in the evening.\n\nSeason 27, Episode 1 \u2014 the President Donald Trump-skewering Sermon on the \u2018Mount \u2014 premiered as promised on July 24, but then the show went on a one-week hiatus.\n\nSouth Park then continued Aug. 6 when the show took aim at Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance with Episode 2 \u2014 Got a Nut \u2014 before going on hiatus for another week before the premiere of the tech bro-ChatGPT-Trump episode Sickofancy on Comedy Central on Aug. 20.\n\nNow, after a month of guessing when new episodes of South Park would be released, Comedy Central has given some clarity regarding the upcoming schedule. According to The Hollywood Reporter and other publications, South Park Season 27\u2019s episodes will be released every other week, at least through September.\n\nWhen Will The Upcoming Episodes Of \u2018South Park\u2019 Be Released?\n\nUnlike the mystery of when viewers would see the second and third episodes of South Park Season 27, Comedy Central has given some clarity to when the next two episodes will air.\n\nPer THR, Comedy Central has announced that the fourth episode of South Park Season 27 will not air until Wednesday, Sept. 3, and after another week break, Season 27, Episode 5 will be released on Sept. 17.\n\nSince the next two episodes of South Park are arriving in two-week intervals, it appears to be a sign that the one week on-one week off pattern will go on all season. If that ends up being the case, then Season 27 of South Park won\u2019t conclude until Nov. 19 on Comedy Central and Nov. 20 on Paramount+, since new episodes don\u2019t stream until the next day.\n\nTo date, neither Trey Parker, Matt Stone nor Comedy Central has given a reason for stretching out episode releases to one every two weeks \u2014 apart from Comedy Central\u2019s explanation, per THR, that Aug. 13 was reserved to celebrate \u201cSouth Park Day.\u201d On that day, Comedy Central aired a marathon of South Park favorites, along with interview footage from Parker and Stone from San Diego Comic-Con in July.",

      "text": "The Trump Resistance-era of South Park continues with the show\u2019s latest season 27 episode.\nIn a promo for the new episode (below), Towelie heads to Washington, D.C., and discovers the town overrun by soldiers and tanks. \u201cWow, Washington, D.C.!\u201d Towelie enthuses amid shots of a town overrun by the military. \u201cThis seems like a perfect place for a towel.\u201d The episode is titled \u201cSickofancy.\u201d\nThe footage suggests South Park is tackling President Trump\u2019s controversial decision to deploy a significant number of federal law enforcement and immigration agents into the nation\u2019s capital as part of a crackdown on crime and homelessness. The White House has said the move has resulted in hundreds of arrests. Critics have called it an unnecessary authoritarian takeover of the District, which has seen its crime statistics fall in recent years.\nRelated Stories\nIt comes at a time when South Park \u2014 long famed for refusing to be perceived as taking political sides and mocking all comers \u2014 has taken a decidedly strong and recurring stance this season against the Trump administration (at least, so far).\nComedy Central also announced that after Wednesday\u2019s episode, the next episode of South Park won\u2019t air until Sept. 3, and then won\u2019t air again until Sept. 17. In other words, the show will be running every other week for the near future. This follows last week being skipped (the network claimed it was to celebrate the show\u2019s anniversary, and aired a marathon of past episodes), as well as the show skipping a week after its ratings record-breaking season premiere.\nWhile the network and South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone haven\u2019t commented on the schedule shifts, one might assume they\u2019re using the extra time to edge away from the show\u2019s usual breakneck six-day production schedule and give themselves more breathing room to make episodes at a time when the show is under perhaps unprecedented scrutiny and enjoying a surge of viewership.\nSouth Park\u2018s ratings have been setting records for Comedy Central. The season 27 premiere delivered 6 million cross-platform viewers and had the show\u2019s biggest share in 25 years. The second episode then delivered 6.2 million viewers and had the show\u2019s biggest share ever.\nThe second episode took aim at Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and resulted in some back and forth between the Trump administration and the series. Noem was portrayed as a serial puppy shooter with a face that kept melting off, while the secretary shot back, \u201cIt\u2019s so lazy to make fun of women for how they look.\u201d\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

      "text": "Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s controversial South Park Season 27 Episode 2 taking on Kristi Noem and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now streaming.\nThe classic Comedy Central satire series kicked off its 27th season on July 23 by skewering President Donald Trump, which prompted a strongly-worded response by the White House. By July 29, it became apparent in a post on the official South Park account on X that ICE was in Parker and Stone\u2019s comedic crosshairs for the second episode in Season 27.\nNote: The remainder of this article features spoilers from the South Park Season 27 Episode 2 episode.\nIn the 20-second clip promoting Episode 2 of South Park Season 27, Mr. Mackay is shown riding in an ICE convoy and pulling up a mask over the bottom half of his face while holding a rifle.\nThen on Tuesday, South Park posted another teaser on X promoting the upcoming episode \u2014 titled Got a Nut \u2014 with a photo of Mr. Mackay in his ICE gear standing next to a South Park version of U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Noem, as well as an image of Cartman with a laptop in his bedroom.\nThe teaser for the Got a Nut episode included a short teaser that said, \u201cWhen Mr. Mackay loses his job, he desperately tries to find a new way to make a living.\u201d You can see the full post below.\nAs promised, in the episode, South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackay loses his job after 26 years because of cuts to Department of Education funding and has to join ICE as a result to make his \u201cnut\u201d (aka personal expenses).\nNoem first appears in the episode in an ICE training video shooting puppies, referring to her admission in her book in 2024 about shooting her \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d family dog. Noem pops up again throughout the episode guiding Mackay and his new fellow ICE officers on raids (and shooting more puppies, including one in pop culture who has surged in popularity this summer).\nSouth Park Season 27 Episode 2 \u2014 Got a Nut \u2014 first aired on Comedy Central on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET/PT. The new episodes then began streaming on Thursday at 6 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT on Paramount+.\nAlong with mocking ICE, Got a Nut once again went after Trump as well as Vice President V.D. Vance, who serves as the president\u2019s version of a Tattoo-like assistant to Trump\u2019s Mr. Roarke-like character in a spoof of the TV classic Fantasy Island that takes place a Mar-a-lago.\nThe inclusion of Trump wasn\u2019t a huge surprise, considering that the promotional teaser from July 29 included a few seconds of the South Park version of the president rubbing Satan\u2019s leg under a table.\nAnd yes, Satan makes an appearance in the new South Park episode, too. Elsewhere, the photo of Cartman is a reference to his reaction of Clyde\u2019s incendiary new podcast that has a right wing theme that infuriates the perpetual instigator. As a result, Cartman starts his own podcast and becomes a \u201cmaster debater.\"\nFor viewers who don\u2019t have Paramount+, the Paramount Global streaming platform offers an ad-based Paramount+ Essential plan, which is $7.99 per month, as well as an ad-free Paramount+ Premium plan for $12.99 per month.\n\u2018South Park\u2019 Vs. The U.S. Government, Round 2\nSouth Park\u2019s X post to tease Season 27 Episode 2 on Tuesday morning prompted a response by the Department of Homeland Security on X later in the day.\nThe DHS post on X included a screengrab of the ICE convoy from South Park\u2019s teaser video released on July 29, along with a link directing interested parties to apply to join ICE.\nIn turn, the South Park account took a swipe at the post and the White House\u2019s statement about the show not being \u201crelevant\u201d for the past 20 years by replying on X, \u201cWait, so we ARE relevant?\u201d along with the hashtag #eatabagofd---s.\nSouth Park Season 27 Episode 2 \u2014 Got a Nut \u2014 is streaming on Paramount+."

      "text": "South Park\u2019s Season 27 premiere episode \u2014 where creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone take on President Donald Trump \u2014 has media outlets buzzing.\nWhile there aren\u2019t enough episodes for critics to release a season review for South Park Season 27 plenty of online outlets are sharing their observations of Episode 1, called Sermon on the \u2018Mount.\nAfter the series\u2019 premiere was delayed two weeks over Skydance\u2019s pending acquisition of Paramount Global \u2014 as well as Paramount Global\u2019s negotiations with Parker and Stone to bring South Park to its Paramount+ streaming platform \u2014 Episode 1 finally premiered on Comedy Central on Wednesday.\nParamount Global and Stone and Parker finally reached a deal early Wednesday that is worth $1.5 billion over five years, and Season 27 Episode 1 premiered on Paramount+ early Thursday morning \u2014 along with South Park\u2019s first 26 seasons.\nThe logline for South Park Season 27 Episode 1 reads, \u201cWhen the residents of South Park face their possible demise, Jesus returns to give them an important message.\u201d\nHowever, upon Jesus\u2019 visit to South Park Elementary, it sets off a chain of events that extends to the White House, where Parker and Stone go hard after President Donald Trump with scenes involving Satan and lots of nudity \u2014 South Park animation-style and via a live-action AI deepfake.\nIn addition, the episode works in pointed observations about Paramount\u2019s $16 million lawsuit settlement with Trump and even manages to work in a reference to \u201cEpstein\u2019s list.\u201d\nIn her take on the Season 27 premiere, Liz Shannon Miller of Consequence wrote that \u201ccreators Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a lot, but perhaps the most important thing they did was remember what punching up looks like.\n\u201cTaking aim at President Trump in a way that seems actively tailored to piss the current administration off, Sermon on the \u2018Mount plays like a direct dare to Paramount to cancel the show, or for our government to make Parker and Stone\u2019s lives very unpleasant the next time they try to go through airport security,\u201d Miller added. \u201cAnd by doing so, the pair have created a piece of subversive political art that feels like a true reflection of today.\u201d\nWhat Did Other Outlets Say About The \u2018South Park\u2019 Season 27 Premiere?\nAlan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone also lauded Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s gutsy episode, even if their criticism was leveled by using South Park brand humor.\n\u201cAt precarious moments like this, certain things need to be said out loud, even if they\u2019re being packaged with juvenile d--- jokes,\u201d Sepinwall wrote in Rolling Stone. \u201cWhen so many of their peers are too scared to offer even a mealy-mouthed version of criticism, Parker, Stone, and South Park just went for it. Motivations don\u2019t matter.\u201d\nWhile President Donald Trump and conservatives were at the center of Episode 1\u2019s mockery, Parker and Stone have been known to be an equal opportunity offenders. As such, Sepinwall wrote that viewers shouldn\u2019t be surprised if a future episode lampoons the left.\n\u201cDesperate times mean you can\u2019t afford to interrogate the credentials of everyone who takes your side, even if it\u2019s only temporary,\u201d Sepinwall writes in Rolling Stone. \u201cParker and Stone can be so politically elusive that it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if the next episode had a subplot about AOC [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] in a bikini contest, so the duo can once again insist that their chief goal is to play devil\u2019s advocate to whatever the conventional wisdom of the moment is.\u201d\nIn his assessment of the South Park Season 27 premiere for The Guardian in the U.K., Stuart Heritage wrote that there could be greater implications for Paramount.\n\u201cSermon on the \u2018Mount is a grand dare. If Trump could get $16 million by suing Paramount over an editorially acceptable edit on a news [program], then it stands to reason that he will try to go after a cartoon that depicts him trying to insert his microscopic p---- into Satan,\" Heritage wrote in The Guardian. \u201cAnd if he does sue, will Paramount risk destroying its already damaged reputation by capitulating yet again?\u201d\nWhile media outlets celebrated the South Park Season 27 premiere, it managed to attract one major criticism \u2014 from the White House.\n\u201cThis show hasn\u2019t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to media outlets (via Variety). \u201cPresident Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country\u2019s history \u2013 and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump\u2019s hot streak.\u201d\nSouth Park Season 27 is available on streaming on Paramount+ along with Seasons 1-26."

      "text": "Peacemaker Season 2 is back with Episode 1, which contains a shocking scene with John Cena which provides provides proof once again why the series has a TV-MA rating.\nThe second season of DC Studios\u2019 hit antihero series finds Peacemaker/Chris Smith (Cena) in a dark place, as he\u2019s still haunted by the tragic death of his brother in his youth and by how he was forced to execute his father, Auggie (Robert Patrick), at the end of Season 1.\nAlso bothering Chris is his failed attempt at a romantic relationship with the now former ARGUS Agent Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), who lost her job after the events of Season 1.\nNote: Spoilers are discussed throughout the rest of the article.\nAfter learning from Emilia that their brief romantic dalliance was a mistake and that she wants to move on, Chris returns to his father\u2019s home, where he now resides and snorts some hardcore substance that at first seems to give him hallucinations.\nHowever, as Chris discovers, the people who suddenly show up in the flesh, quite literally, are real.\nSuddenly, Chris finds himself \u2014 fully clothed \u2014 in the middle of an orgy in his living room where countless men and women are naked and having sex in a scene that is punctuated by graphic depictions of male and female full-frontal nudity.\nJames Gunn Says There Was No Pushback From HBO Over The Scene\nPeacemaker creator James Gunn \u2014 who writes all of the episodes in Season 2 and directs three of them, including Season 1 \u2014 said in a recent Zoom conversation that the show\u2019s home, HBO, had no qualms about the orgy scene.\n\u201cIt was really about dealing with HBO on it, and they didn't give us any pushback,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cThey just didn't ever even mention it, so I guess they're okay with it.\u201d\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise that HBO didn\u2019t raise any concerns about the scene. After all, the cable network and its streaming service, HBO Max, knew the hardcore nature of Peacemaker with the release of Season 1 \u2014 which was also rated TV-MA \u2014 mainly because of the graphic violence in the series and its rough language.\nOn top of that, Peacemaker is a spinoff series from Gunn\u2019s 2021 DC antihero movie The Suicide Squad, which had an R rating.\nGunn and his longtime filmmaking collaborator, Peter Safran, were hired as co-CEOs of Warner Bros.\u2019 DC Studios division in 2022, at which time they were tasked with rebooting the DC Universe that extends across film and television in both live-action and animated capacities.\nGunn, of course, is also the writer and director of the first new DCU live-action film, Superman, which was released in theaters in July.\nAnd while Peacemaker Season 2 is tied to the events of Superman and even brings in some characters from the superhero feature, Gunn said the stories of the new DCU are being told with different creative sensibilities that vary in tone \u2014 and the adult audience vibe of Peacemaker is a reflection of just how different each story will be.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for us in the DCU that we\u2019re telling incredibly different stories for different groups of people,\u201d Gunn explained. \u201cIt should be made very clear to people that although [Peacemaker Season 2] is a continuation of Superman, this is not for children. This is for adults and I think it\u2019s important that the DCU tells stories for adults.\u201d\nAnd while Peacemaker Season 2 takes a hardcore turn as it begins to set up the rest of the new DCU, Gunn assures audiences that there will be something for everybody going forward.\n\u201cWe have the Krypto shorts coming out that are for kids and we have Supergirl [in 2026], which is a family audience in the same way Superman was,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cWe also have Clayface being made [for 2026], which is an R-rated horror movie, so there are all different types of stories in the same universe. That variety is what makes it really fun to me.\u201d\nPeacemaker Season 2, Episode 1 is new on streaming on HBO Max and on cable on HBO."

      "text": "Stans \u2014 a music documentary about iconic rapper Eminem and how his songs have resonated with his enormous fan base \u2014 is coming to streaming this week.\nStans opened in theaters in limited release on Aug. 7. The title of the feature-length documentary was inspired by the name of Eminem\u2019s legendary song released 25 years ago.\n\u201cReleased in 2000, Eminem\u2019s song \u2018Stan,\u2019 about an obsessive, unstable fan, remains iconic \u2014 so iconic that the term stan was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017,\" reads the official summary of Stans from Paramount+. \"The song and its storyline serve as a guiding light for this unconventional and fully authorized feature, which follows a cast of real-life stans whose deep personal connections to Eminem mirror some of the many themes found throughout his lyrics.\n\u201cMore than just an exploration of fandom, Stans examines the complicated relationship between one of the world\u2019s most private artists and his massive public persona. Through stylized recreations, rare archival footage and intimate original interviews, it offers a raw, loud and revealing journey across Eminem\u2019s career and the passionate audience that has grown with him.\u201d\nStans will make its streaming premiere on Tuesday, Aug. 27, on Paramount+.\nThe streaming platform has two tiers. Paramount+ Essential is an ad-based tier that costs $7.99 per month, while Paramount+ Premium is an ad-free tier and costs $12.99 per month. Both tiers offer a free seven-day trial.\nDirector Says One Line In \u2018Stan\u2019 Song Echoes Through \u2018Stans\u2019 Movie\nIn addition to being featured in Stans, Eminem \u2014 whose real name is Marshall Mathers III \u2014 produces the documentary. Stans is directed by Emmy Award-winning writer, director and investigative journalist Steven Leckart.\n\u201c'Stan' is one of the most unconventional songs ever written, where the story is mostly told from a fan's perspective, so this film was an incredible opportunity to find a unique approach,\u201d Leckart said in the Paramount+ press release announcing the streaming date of Stans.\n\u201cWe kept coming back to one lyric from the song: 'I\u2019m just like you.\u2019 Fans who echo that same sentiment carry much of the film,\" Leckhart added. \"But like the song, Marshall's perspective was also essential to the movie. I'm grateful for just how candid, sincere and frequently hilarious he was.\"\nStans was a huge hit with Rotten Tomatoes critics, who gave the film a 93% \u201cfresh\u201d review based on 14 reviews. Stans also received a 94% \u201cfresh\u201d score on RT\u2019s Popcornmeter based on 100-plus verified user ratings.\nStans debuts on streaming on Paramount+ on Tuesday."

The summary for Thunderbolts* reads, \u201cMarvel Studios assembles an unconventional team of antiheroes \u2014 Yelena Belova (Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Stan), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) and John Walker (Wyatt Russell).\n\u201cAfter finding themselves ensnared in a death trap set by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss), these disillusioned castoffs must embark on a dangerous mission that will force them to confront the darkest corners of their pasts. Will this dysfunctional group tear themselves apart, or find redemption and unite as something much more before it\u2019s too late?\u201d\nThunderbolts*, aka The New Avengers, will begin streaming on Disney+ on Wednesday, Aug. 27, per a recent announcement by the streaming platform.\nFor viewers who don\u2019t have Disney+, the streaming platform offers various subscription options.

      "text": "Vice President JD Vance appears to be taking being mocked on the new episode of South Park in stride.\nSouth Park Season 27, of course, has been unflinching in poking fun at the Trump administration, first by skewering President Donald Trump in its premiere episode on July 23, followed by an all-out comedic attack on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in the second episode of the new season.\nThe episode \u2014 titled Got a Nut \u2014 premiered on cable\u2019s Comedy Central on Wednesday night and began streaming on Paramount+ on Thursday morning. While the majority of Got a Nut takes aim at Noem and her Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, the episode, toward the end, features Trump and Vance in a parody of the classic ABC-TV series Fantasy Island.\nDuring the scenes, Mr. Mackay \u2014 who became an ICE officer after being fired from his job as a South Park Elementary counselor because of a cut in funding from the Department of Education \u2014 works under Noem\u2019s watch. Impressed by his service, she sends her new star employee to meet the president at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\nAs South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone liken Trump\u2019s Florida home to a luxurious destination akin to the locales featured in Fantasy Island, the animated version of Trump is seen wearing a white suit, a la Mr. Rourke (played in the series by Ricardo Montalban), while Vance is portrayed like Rourke\u2019s diminutive assistant, Tattoo (Herv\u00e9 Villechaize).\nVance responded to the South Park parody on Thursday morning by simply writing, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve finally made it.\u201d Vance\u2019s post is a repost from South Park\u2019s official X account, which reads, \u201cWelcome to Mar-A-Lago! #SouthPark.\u201d\nThe post with Vance\u2019s response is embedded below. Obviously, it\u2019s much milder than the White House\u2019s response carried by several media outlets in July to the premiere episode featuring Trump, which partially reads, \u201cThis show hasn\u2019t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.\n\"President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country\u2019s history \u2013 and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump\u2019s hot streak.\u201d\nNote: The next section includes spoilers for the new \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode \u201cGot a Nut.\u201d\nHow Does \u2018South Park\u2019 Mock JD Vance In The New Episode?\nDuring the Fantasy Island parody featuring President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a private plane carrying Mr. Mackay arrives at Mar-a-Lago.\nAfter that, Trump\u2019s Mr. Roarke-like character yells, \u201cRelax! Take a load off,\u201d while Vance\u2019s Tattoo-esque character yells, \u201cBoss, the plane is here from Immigration and Customs Enforcement!\u201d Trump replies to Vance, \u201cI know, stupid! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\nIn the real Fantasy Island series, Tattoo would typically yell upon the guests\u2019 arrival, \u201cThe plane! The plane!\u201d\nFrom there, Vance is seen riding in the back of a golf cart driven by Trump. After Trump welcomes Mr. Mackay to Mar-a-Lago, he kicks Vance out of the way and makes his guest a lucrative offer to become the new face of the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 alluding to animated Kristi Noem\u2019s continuously melting face during the episode.\nAfter that, Mr. Mackay is invited to join Trump and Satan in bed and he freaks out about the offer and Satan says, \u201cI just want to go. This place is gross!\u201d\nThe vice president appears on the scene again and asks Trump, \u201cWould you like me to apply the baby oil to Satan\u2019s a-----e, boss?\u201d\nVance and Trump scenes conclude as Noem lands at Mar-a-Lago and confronts the president about replacing her. Both the president and vice president appear again during the episode\u2019s closing credits.\nSouth Park Season 27 Episode 2 \u2014 Got a Nut\u2014 is streaming now on Paramount+."

      "text": "After signing a new $1.5 billion deal with Paramount, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are part of Hollywood\u2019s most elite club.\nIf you piss off South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, they will make you pay\u2014both financially and satirically. On July 2, after Comedy Central delayed the Season 27 premiere of the show because Paramount, the network\u2019s parent company, was locked in a contentious negotiation for its streaming rights\u2014in the midst of months-long acquisition of Paramount by David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media\u2014Parker and Stone issued a statement on X.com and let it rip: \u201cThis merger is a shit show,\u201d the duo wrote, \u201cand it's fucking up South Park.\u201d\nBoth transactions were resolved this week, as Parker and Stone agreed Monday to a five-year, $1.5 billion streaming deal that will bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. And Thursday, the FCC officially approved the Skydance acquisition. The deal cements the duo\u2019s place as the highest-paid TV showrunners in Hollywood and made the 55-year-old Parker and the 54-year-old Stone billionaires\u2014worth an estimated $1.2 billion each.\nBut the new agreement\u2014which will pay the pair at least $250 million per year\u2014didn\u2019t end Paramount\u2019s headaches. In South Park\u2019s season premiere, which aired Wednesday, Donald Trump is depicted in bed with Satan, and Jesus is seen warning the show\u2019s young protagonists about the dangers of provoking him. \u201cYou guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount,\u201d says the Jesus character. \u201cYou really want to end up like Colbert?\u201d\nThe comedically fearless Parker and Stone now enter television\u2019s rare billionaire creative class, joining Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Dick Wolf and Jerry Seinfeld in the three-comma club.\nThat astonishing amount of money is a testament to the enduring popularity of South Park, which has been a cultural phenomenon since its debut on Comedy Central in 1997, becoming, in just its second season, the highest-rated non-sports program in basic cable history, with nearly six million viewers. Over the years it became indispensable to Comedy Central, and its 300-plus episodes have now become bulk inventory that re-air dozens of times per week.\nParker and Stone\u2019s real coup came in 2007, when the creators and their lawyer and business partner, Kevin Morris, struck a deal with the network to play South Park episodes online using a rudimentary Flash video player, agreeing to split the then-non-existent digital revenues 50-50 \u201cin perpetuity.\u201d\nThen came the streaming revolution. Hulu licensed the show\u2019s streaming rights in 2014 for $87.5 million and reupped for $110 million through 2019. HBO Max then won a bidding war over Peacock, Netflix and others to become South Park\u2019s exclusive domestic streaming home for $550 million over five years. That deal expired in June.\nInstead of just pocketing their half of the HBO deal, in 2021 Parker and Stone negotiated for a new arrangement with Paramount (which owns Comedy Central) for a guaranteed $155 million a year in exchange for creating new episodes of the show and their portion of the streaming revenue. Monday\u2019s agreement renegotiated the terms of that deal, upping the annual payout to $250 million.\nParker and Stone pour that wealth into Park County, not only the location of South Park\u2019s fictional town but also the name of their production studio, which is owned entirely by the pair. Founded in 2012, they route all income from their TV show, movie projects and stage productions of The Book of Mormon (which they cowrote) through the company, taking only an estimated $10 million per year in salary.\nIt\u2019s a common corporate structure among Hollywood\u2019s top earners, but unlike other companies such as Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine or Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Entertainment, Park County has never taken on equity partners or investors. Instead, in 2012, Parker and Stone leveraged the existing and projected future income generated by South Park and other projects to score $60 million in convertible debt funding from media-focused merchant bank The Raine Group. As long as they paid off the loan on time, they would keep all of the equity. The bet on themselves paid off as the streaming dollars began to flow in, and in 2016 Parker and Stone bought out Raine, maintaining full ownership ever since.\nPark County continues to use debt to fund the company\u2019s growth, including securing an $800 million credit line from private equity giant The Carlyle Group in 2023. Using the cost of the debt and some clever Hollywood accounting around depreciating catalog value, Park County has been able to lower and delay its tax bills considerably.\nThe ultimate exit plan would be to one day sell the company, settle up with creditors and tax collectors, and pocket the remaining cash.\nSources tell Forbes that Viacom (Comedy Central\u2019s then-parent company) and Park County discussed doing exactly that in 2019, a deal reminiscent of Disney\u2019s acquisition of valuable brands such as Lucasfilm or Marvel. The two sides got as far as a $1 billion valuation before talks broke down. That same year Viacom was, just as it has been lately, in the midst of a messy merger with CBS that made high-priced acquisitions difficult. When the companies returned to the negotiating table in 2021, Park County\u2019s overall production deal rang in at $935 million over six years\u2014nearly the same price tag as the acquisition, without ownership changing hands.\nGiven Park County\u2019s guaranteed revenue and strong profitability, Forbes estimates the enterprise value of the company could now reach as much as $3 billion in a potential sale, netting Parker and Stone more than $1 billion each.\nParamount and Park County\u2019s most recent round of negotiations proved to be the toughest yet, and became an early referendum on the stewardship of Skydance\u2019s David Ellison, son of the world\u2019s second richest man Larry Ellison. He told analysts he wants his new Paramount to be \u201ca creativity-first studio and the first stop for best-in-class storytellers.\u201d Where previous owners had licensed some of the company\u2019s biggest shows, like South Park and Yellowstone, to other streaming services for a short-term cash influx, it seems Ellison is prioritizing bringing everything back under the company\u2019s own streaming platform, Paramount+.\nIt hadn\u2019t gone entirely smoothly. In late June, Park County threatened legal action against Skydance, which they believed was tampering with their talks with Netflix and Warner Bros. about potentially obtaining South Park\u2019s streaming rights. Paramount was motivated to make a deal and eager to avoid more negative publicity, like that which followed a $16 million settlement paid to Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris and the recent cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\nFacing the prospect of another season premiere delay and potential trash talking on stage at San Diego Comic-Con this week\u2014where Parker and Stone took a rare high road\u2014Skydance and Paramount agreed Monday to rework Park County\u2019s production deal in conjunction with the new streaming rights agreement, a sticking point in the negotiations.\nWith their pockets sufficiently lined by the $1.5 billion deal, Parker and Stone will produce 10 new episodes of South Park each year until 2030, and there\u2019s little doubt they will continue to poke fun at both their parent company and a very litigious president. When asked at during a Comic-Con panel Thursday evening what to expect from the rest of this season, Stone quipped, \u201cno politics,\u201d drawing laughter from the crowd.\nAnd Parker, when asked about Trump\u2019s negative reaction to the first episode, answered with similar deadpan: \u201cWe\u2019re terribly sorry.\u201d"

      "text": "Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s South Park Season 27, Episode 3 \u2014 titled Sickofancy \u2014 took on the artificial intelligence boom with ChatGPT, tech bros, the immigration crackdown and President Donald Trump and Satan (again) at the White House.\nReturning for Episode 3 after the show\u2019s second hiatus this season, South Park revealed a brief teaser clip of Sickofancy Tuesday night on the show\u2019s X account, which showed Toweley going to Washington, D.C. A pair of photos promoting the episode on X show Toweley outside of the nation\u2019s capital and another of Randy and Stan Marsh with Stan dosing himself with something at the family\u2019s Tedgridy Farms home.\nNote: Spoiler details from \u201cSickofancy\u201d are revealed through the rest of the article.\nAs it turns out, Randy is microdosing himself with ketamine to bolster his creativity after agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detain all of his migrant workers while they were in the fields of his cannabis farm. Randy\u2019s plan is to get Tegridy Farms back on its feet after he and his one employee, Toweley, turn to their reliable \u201cfriend\u201d ChatGPT.\nFrom there, Randy imagines himself as a tech bro and hallucinates a transformation of turning Tegridy into Techridy, which is \u201cno longer a marijuana farm\" but \u201can AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions.\u201d Sharon\u2019s had enough of Randy\u2019s constant reliance on ChatGPT because she feels it does nothing but kiss her husband\u2019s backside with constant pandering: \u201cGo ahead and have fun with your little sychophant machine,\u201d Sharon rages at Randy.\nThe sycophant behavior \u2014 hence, the Sickofancy \u2014 then continues inside the White House, where a lineup of power players the likes of Apple CEO Tim Cook (and later on, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg) each tell Trump how great he is, give him a gift and remind him that he does not have small genitalia. Trump then goes to his bedroom to cozy up to Satan again, who also has a newfound friendship with ChatGPT. Satan is somehow hoping ChatGPT can develop an exit strategy to get away from Trump.\nWhy Did Toweley Go To Washington, D.C.?\nWhile the South Park promotional teaser for Episode 3 \u2014 Sickofancy \u2014 implies that Trey Parker and Matt Stone were aiming to skewer President Donald Trump\u2019s order to have the government take control of the Washington, D.C., police force to clean up the nation\u2019s capital, it turns out to be somewhat of a misdirect.\nInstead, Toweley was sent by Randy to D.C. to lobby the idea of making marijuana legal nationwide so Randy can put his grand Techridy plans into play. Using ChatGPT, Randy booked Toweley\u2019s travel plans, got his employee White House clearance and found the perfect president to give to the president.\nAs such, the government takeover of D.C. \u2014 and it\u2019s huge with thousands of troops and military firepower \u2014 merely provides a backdrop to Toweley\u2019s mission. When meeting with Trump, Toweley opens a package, which is a camera that projects a hologram of Randy, who asks the president to \"reclassify marijuana on the national level\" (something that Trump is actually considering).\nAs for the gift, it\u2019s Toweley, who is surprised by the offer.\nBack at Tegridy, Randy is suffering the mindbending side effects of microdosing too much ketamine, while Sharon seems to have taken on ChatGPT\u2019s personality. As it turns out, it was part of a plan to outsmart Randy\u2019s AI assistant.\nThe episode ends with Randy giving up on his hemp business and selling Tegridy Farms. Since Randy can\u2019t remember the last few days because of his ketamine bender, he also asks his family, \u201cHas anyone seen Toweley?\u201d who is still at the White House \u2014 and is subject to a disgusting existence.\nSouth Park Season 27, Episode 3 \u2014 Sickofancy \u2014 began streaming on Paramount+ Thursday morning at 6 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT after airing on cable on Comedy Central Wednesday night.\nViewers can stream the new South Park episode anytime with a Paramount+ subscription. The platform offers an ad-based monthly subscription with Paramount+ Essential for $7.99 a month (or $59.99 annually) and an ad-free subscription with Paramount+ Premium for $12.99 per month (or $119.99 annually). Both plans come with a free seven-day trial.\nSouth Park Season 27 returns with Episode 4 on Sept. 3."
