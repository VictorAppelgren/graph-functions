  "description": "From seven-figure jewelry empire to beauty disruption: Andraya Kenton launches Luna Roca \u2014 a \u00a335 volcanic face roller to democratize luxury skincare.",
  "content": "When Andraya Kenton spotted a friend pulling out a volcanic roller at dinner in Bali, she didn\u2019t just see a beauty tool \u2014 she saw her next business opportunity. \u201cIt worked, but it wasn\u2019t chic,\u201d recalls the founder of multi-seven-figure jewelry brands Celeste Starre and MeMe London.\n\n\u201cThat was the spark. Why hasn\u2019t anyone created a glow-giving beauty tool that looks and feels as good as it works?\u201d\n\nThat dinner conversation, shared with a marketing guru and manufacturing expert, would mark Kenton\u2019s subsequent venture beyond jewelry and into the global beauty industry that\u2019s worth a staggering $600 billion.\n\nFast forward a year on since that serendipitous event, Kenton launches Luna Roca this July, a lava rock face roller priced at an affordable \u00a335 (approx. $46). Kenton puts it in the \u201caccessible luxury\u201d category \u2014 a strategic decision reflecting her 15 years of experience building consumer brands that have dressed celebrities from Blake Lively to Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThe subconscious inspiration for Luna Roca traces back to Kenton\u2019s early twenties spent in Japan, where blotting papers were beauty essentials, and later to ancient Chinese beauty rituals she discovered during her travels. \u201cLiving in Bali, where the heat and humidity are constant, I found myself constantly reaching for something portable to stay fresh,\u201d she explains. And when she saw a functioning solution in front of her, the dots instantly connected.\n\nLiterally \u201ca million years in the making,\u201d the compact roller features a removable volcanic lava rock ball that promises to mattify skin while providing lymphatic drainage benefits. \u201cYou can even use it over makeup, and it won\u2019t smudge or shift your face,\u201d Kenton notes. \u201cA total game changer,\u201d \u2014 especially for today\u2019s consumers, who \u2014 as informed as they are demanding \u2014 are permanently searching for ways to refreshed skin without the need for chemicals or powders that disrupt their natural balance.\n\nUnlike her friend\u2019s roller that served the purpose but \u201cdefinitely not something you\u2019d be excited to pull out of your handbag,\u201d Luna Roca is undeniably pleasing on the eye \u2014 think muted earthy base palette completed with a pop of neon, design that allows easy removal of the lava rock, as well as a sleek outer box reminding customers of its functionality and origin. The final outcome is not just worthy of being toted around, it is a great talking point and even an accessory \u2014 much like Hailey Bieber\u2019s lip gloss phone case and Touchland\u2019s portable hand sanitizing mist \u2014 that could easily become the next viral beauty trend on TikTok.\n\nBut the real differentiator lies in the efforts made in meeting sustainability credentials that align with Kenton\u2019s personal values \u2014 ones that helped shaping all her business ventures. The volcanic stone is sustainably sourced, the casing made from recycled materials, and the lava rock ball can be removed, washed, dried overnight and reused again and again. Just like your make-up brushes, but even easier. \u201cThat kind of thoughtful, low waste design really matters to me,\u201d says Kenton.\n\nFor younger consumers increasingly seeking products aligned with their values, Luna Roca\u2019s environmental positioning and simple application with immediate visible results could prove decisive \u2014 especially for Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Evereden, a skin and haircare brand for kids and preteens, initially attracted young mothers searching for safe products for their sensitive skin infants, and now brings in $100 million in annual sales thanks to its proven formulation and loyal customer base. Tatcha, the luxury skincare brand emphasizing sustainable sourcing, refillable packaging, and have partnerships focused on environmental and social impact, showed serious profitability and was acquired by Unilever for reportedly $500+ million. \u201cToday\u2019s customer gets that. They\u2019re done with wasteful beauty. They want results, they want integrity, and they want something that actually looks as good as it feels to use,\u201d Kenton observes.\n\nKenton\u2019s hard-won experience navigating product development and global supply logistics has prepped her for this transition from jewelry to beauty. Shipping chaos, COVID distruptions, and now unexpected tariffs resulted from trade wars, the serial-preneur has seen it all. Now she\u2019s applying those lessons to a faster-moving industry.\n\n\u201cWhat they [MeMe London and Celeste Starre] share with beauty is emotion. That said, beauty moves much faster. In beauty, it\u2019s all about functional results and storytelling that spreads across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond.\u201d\n\nFamily is paramount to Kenton, with her sharing a deep bond with her children and stepchildren \u2014 one of whom she has been working with on multiple projects for the past few years. Her stepdaughter Tabi Kenton, with whom she\u2019s co-founded both their Bali-based concept store STACKED and now Luna Roca, is central to the new beauty brand\u2019s development and brings that crucial Gen Z perspective. \u201cTabi is a digital guru with a natural eye for what\u2019s cool, current, and culturally relevant,\u201d Kenton explains. \u201cI bring two decades of brand building and operational grounding. Together, we speak to both mothers and daughters.\u201d\n\nKenton doesn\u2019t hesitate in voicing her ambitions for Luna Roca. \u201cThe Rock and Roller is just the beginning,\u201d says Kenton, telling me their vision is to build an entire cosmic beauty universe: \u201cOne that blends empowerment, earth alignment, and elevated design, all with products that really work.\u201d In a crowded beauty market, the combination of ancient wisdom, modern design, and accessible luxury positioning is just about the winning recipe with the conscious consumer base she\u2019s cultivated over more than a decade.",

      "text": "Forbes 30 Under 30 alum Kimberley Ho walked away from her Wall Street career to launch Evereden for Generation Alpha. Today, her business and customers are maturing together.\nKimberley Ho\u2019s dining room table is almost always cluttered. On any given afternoon, the 35-year-old cofounder and CEO of Evereden, the New York-based cosmetics company for kids, risks ruining the white marble surface by testing bright-colored lipsticks in the shape of crayons and other beauty products aimed at Generation Alpha, or people born after 2010.\n\u201cWe now have a laboratory with chemists, and research and development specialists,\u201d says Ho, a member of the Forbes 30 Under 30 class of 2019, \u201cbut I have never been willing to leave that part of the job\u2014being product-obsessed is in our DNA.\u201d\nSince cofounding Evereden in 2018 with her husband, Goldman Sachs alum Huang Lee, the brand now brings in $100 million in annual sales after finding a market for family-friendly skin and haircare products for babies and preteens. Many of her earliest customers were young mothers searching for safe products for their sensitive skin infants. Having raised some $40 million in venture capital funding between 2018 and 2021, Evereden, like its client base, has matured, expanding to include face serums, conditioners and perfumes engineered and marketed specifically to kids, preteens and pregnant mothers. While the company sells in Sephora across eight countries outside the United States, including Canada, Australia and the Philippines, most of its revenue comes from direct-to-consumer sales online.\n\u201cBillions of investment dollars have gone to women's beauty, cosmetics and skincare, but none of that innovation and investment really went into family skincare,\u201d Ho says. \u201cThat mismatch just didn't make sense for me.\u201d\nBecause of social media, Gen Alpha first interacts with a beauty product at 8 years old, according to a consumer trends study done last year by Ulta Beauty. That\u2019s a marked difference from younger Millennials and members of Generation Z, who on average first engaged with this industry at 15 and 12 years old, respectively.\n\u201cClearly these young consumers are interested in skincare and are exposed to the internet\u2026they probably need some help picking the right product,\u201d says Dan Su, an analyst at Morningstar. \u201cOtherwise, they would be going to products that are designed for adult skin that may not really serve their needs.\u201d\n\u201cThe most interesting thing [about Evereden] is the tween space,\u201d Su continues, \u201cwhich is catching the attention of the companies and investors and the beauty space.\u201d\nBorn and raised in Malaysia\u2019s bustling capital city Kuala Lumpur, Ho grew up with two entrepreneur parents, who founded a printing company. \u201cI was a literal startup baby in my mother's womb as she was hauling boxes because she couldn't afford to hire anybody,\u201d she says.\nAs a teenager, she became obsessed with getting into an Ivy League school\u2014later pivoting to apply early to Stanford based primarily on campus photos of sunny California on the university\u2019s website. \u201cThat was my first time in America, when I landed in SFO to attend Stanford,\u201d she recalls.\nWith clear, glassy skin and a quick smile, Ho presents as an Elle Woods-type, someone who has never considered anything to be impossible. During her first semester as an economics major at Stanford, she witnessed her peers trying to get in good with Goldman Sachs representatives at recruiting events. A few years later, in 2013, she became an investment banker at the elite Manhattan firm for a few years after college, later moving to the asset management firm Oaktree.\nAt Oaktree, Ho first started seeing troubling patterns in several big beauty brands she worked with, ranging from billion-dollar lawsuits concerning undisclosed health risks, to an influx of indistinguishable direct-to-consumer brands, to smaller quality issues consistently swept under the rug.\n\u201cIt was a lack of care and the integrity of some of these products that made me uncomfortable as a consumer, a beauty lover and someone who grew up with very sensitive skin,\u201d Ho recalls. \u201cThe light bulb moment came to me when my friends back home in Malaysia were starting families, and they would beg me to bring home these big American brands that were so-called \u2018clean and safe.\u2019 But because I was an investor behind the scenes in many of these brands, I knew that they were not as honest as they claim to be.\u201d\nHaving seen a giant hole in premium skincare products, she decided to leave Oaktree in 2017 to launch a high-end family cosmetics brand that became Evereden. Ho emailed her proposal to 50 dermatologists at top medical institutions to help her formulate her products. Dr. Joyce Teng, head of Stanford Medical School's pediatric dermatology department, invited her to pitch her company in person. Ho\u2019s concept immediately resonated with Teng, who shared the story of her youngest daughter\u2019s struggles with severe eczema. Teng soon came on board as the company\u2019s Chief Science Officer and was later joined by two other mothers who worked as doctors at Harvard Medical School. Cosmetics do not require FDA approval before going on the market, but sunscreen and over-the-counter eczema products do. Evereden receives FDA approval for these select items, and its team of doctors allows the company to make claims of being safe and \u201cclinically tested\u201d for all other products across the board.\nEvereden launched in 2018 with one line of baby skincare products following a seed fundraising round led by Sidekick Partners, a Texas-based venture capital firm. In 2019, the company expanded into skincare for mothers, which included oils made to mitigate stretch marks. After surpassing $1 million in revenue in its first few years of business, the company started to add kids\u2019 skin- and haircare into the business.\n\u201cWe expanded mostly because our customers were growing up and were saying, \u2018Hey, my baby's no longer an infant,\u201d Ho says. \u201cIn fact, they have an older sibling. Do you have products for children?\u2019\u201d\nThe brand\u2019s presence in several niche subcategories is paramount to its growth, especially on Amazon. Within a few months of being on the market, the company\u2019s haircare products grew to No. 1 in Amazon\u2019s kids\u2019 hair category\u2014a sector that had been relatively unexplored at the online retail giant. Products for preteens quickly became Evereden\u2019s fastest-growing segment.\nEvereden raised money twice in 2021. The company\u2019s Series C round brought in $32 million and was led by Menlo Park-based GSR Ventures. Much of the funds raised in the Series C went toward building the company\u2019s own formulation lab and team of dedicated chemists.\n\u201cThis not typical in the skincare or beauty industry,\u201d Ho says. \u201cTypically, only the L\u2019Or\u00e9als, Unilevers and P&Gs of the world have their own formulation labs.\u201d\nMost emerging cosmetics brands\u2014including Hailey Bieber\u2019s Rhode Beauty, which recently sold for $1 billion to Elf Beauty\u2014use third-party chemists and labs that charge a fixed rate for formulation while simultaneously doing the same for dozens of other competing businesses.\nThe industry standard to develop a new product with one of these outsourced companies is usually about 18 months. \u201cWith our lab, our product development life cycle is three to six months,\u201d Ho says. \u201cSo, we\u2019re launching products three to four times faster than any one of our competitors.\u201d\nEvereden began launching around 10 products a year starting 2021. Over the next four years, the company added enough products to address every need across its age categories, including hair, skin, body, fragrance and cosmetic products\u2014effectively becoming a one-stop personal care shop for families. Since 2021, Amazon has been one of the brand's fastest-growing channels.\nHo was also naturally conscious of the brand\u2019s presence internationally, given that she originally dreamed up her company after her friends in Malaysia asked her to send clean and safe American products for their newborns. While Evereden is in retail locations abroad, nearly all total sales still come from online purchases. The company had a net profit last year after reaching $100 million in sales.\nWithin the last few years, Evereden\u2019s growth has coincided with marked increases in preteens flooding retailers and social media to test, buy and show off comically extensive skincare routines. Sephora\u2019s 2023 annual report stated that the number of its customers aged 9 to 12 doubled over the last five years, and the global children\u2019s cosmetic market was worth an estimated $1.6 billion in 2024.\n\u201cWe are a multi-category, multi-generational brand, which I think is unique on the market,\u201d Ho says. \u201cNo single SKU makes up more than 20% of our total sales. And we have hero products in each of our categories.\u201d\nWhile Evereden has reaped the benefits from the rise of so-called \u201cSephora kids,\u201d the brand\u2019s recent growth is not directly related to TikTok-influenced children. For one, Evereden isn\u2019t in major U.S. retailers such as Sephora or Ulta yet\u2014although Ho hopes to secure a big retail partnership this year.\nEvereden\u2019s growth has also coincided with the rise of young kids developing an interest in high-end skincare brands such as Drunk Elephant and Laneige. Those brands often notably contain anti-aging components or exfoliating chemicals that dermatologists have said can cause considerable damage to young skin.\nEvereden is priced premium, especially next to a $5 bottle of Johnson\u2019s Baby Lotion, but the brand is relatively inexpensive compared to these adult brands piquing kids\u2019 interests. A 50 ml jar of Drunk Elephant\u2019s moisturizing cream costs $69, whereas a comparable cream from Evereden is less than half that at $28.\nDrunk Elephant reported sales of $120 million when it was acquired by Shiseido in 2019, but that figure dropped 65% in year-over-year sales in 2024, due in part to the losing its older consumer base as the brand soared with kids and tweens.\n\u201cI haven't really seen any specific brand gaining traction,\u201d Morningstar\u2019s Su admits. \u201cI think it is reasonable to think that some of the large brands in the personal care and beauty space would be doing research and coming up with products. But it's just that it's very specific.\u201d\nSu says that Evereden may face challenges since there might not be sufficient consumer data to help them with product development. She also notes that companies across the board are being given the chance to identify and understand young consumers based on their social media use.\n\u201cEvery generation grows up faster than the previous one,\u201d Ho says. \u201cGen Alpha have grown up on social media, and they all have cell phones from eight years old.\u201d\nOn Evereden\u2019s TikTok account, there\u2019s a pinned video with half a million views that begins with two children\u2014around six years old\u2014dabbing one of Evereden\u2019s cream products on their faces, cosplaying as miniature versions of adult influencers who have made millions doing the same on their own accounts. It\u2019s somewhat uncanny seeing such small children expertly pose in front of the camera, but most of comments on the video address something along the lines of \u201cCan you please send me your products?\u201d"
