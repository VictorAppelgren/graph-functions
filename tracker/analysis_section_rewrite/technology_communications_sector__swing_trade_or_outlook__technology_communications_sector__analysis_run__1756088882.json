      "feedback": "The draft shows solid regime-based framing and credible numeric anchors (private-credit ~$50B/quarter; CMBS AI exposure +30% to $15.6B; NXPI ~+7%, ON ~+6.5%; PIK ~6%), but it needs tightening to world-class standards. Actionable edits: (1) Lock the Movers to exactly 4 lines with 2 Up / 2 Down, reform each line for crisper first-principles causality (Driver: durable hyperscaler cash flows financed by private credit/CMBS; Mechanism: liquidity-to-pricing channel via credit spreads; Timeframe: align with 3–6 months and 0–3 weeks as appropriate); (2) Elevate “What to watch” into explicit catalysts and verifiable triggers (e.g., private-credit inflow holding at ~$50B/Q, CMBS AI exposure hitting a new threshold, data-center capex velocity, OpenAI/MIT profitability signals, refinancing windows) and add a concise invalidation note per line; (3) Tighten probabilities to reflect explicit evidence (e.g., Up 3–6 months 60% OBQMETU6O; Up 0–3 weeks 50% S94YUAWG8/OBQMETU6O; Down 3–6 months 40% OBQMETU6O; Down 0–3 weeks 35% OBQMETU6O) and attach citations after the numbers; (4) Decide Tradability for the Swing Trade: if you want a tradable anchor, name a specific instrument from the material (e.g., a semis ETF or the names NXPI/ON as stocks) and supply Entry/Stop/Target/R/R/Invalidation/Trigger; otherwise present the Swing Trade as an Outlook line with Direction, Horizon, Expected path/levels, Decision signals, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, Confidence, citing the 60%/65% base-case framing; (5) Remove redundancy and non-material Apple/Siri/Mashable detail unless you can tie them to the liquidity regime, and ensure the narrative stays focused on AI-infrastructure liquidity and long-horizon cash-flow monetization; (6) Reconcile any conflicts by foregrounding the base-case vs bear-case trade-offs with distinct, testable triggers and a single, coherent transmission channel (private credit/CMBS liquidity into long-dated AI infra). Ensure the final output adheres strictly to the four movers, a single Outlook or Swing Trade line, exact 5-field line format, and citations only for facts/numbers drawn from OBQMETU6O, S94YUAWG8, and related IDs.",
