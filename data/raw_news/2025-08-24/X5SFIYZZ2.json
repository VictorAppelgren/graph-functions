  "content": "WELCOME TO BLOOMBERG MARKETS, I\u2019M SCARLET FU. > > > > WE SEE TECH STOCKS UNDER PRESSURE AS WE APPROACH IN NEW YORK, FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK UNDER PRESSURE TO RESIGN FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HIS ADMINISTRATION ACCUSES HER OF COMMITTING MORTGAGE FRAUD. LET'S GET A CHECK OF WHERE THE MARKET STAND NOW AND THE NASDAQ 100 DECLINING ONE AND A QUARTER PERCENT, THE FIRST BACK-TO-BACK LOSSES OF MORE THAN 1% SINCE THE LIBERATION DAY SELLOFF. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE EQUAL WEIGHTED INDEX FOR THE S & P 500, THE NUMBER OF GAINERS AND DECLINERS ARE ROUGHLY EQUAL, SO YOU ARE NOT SEEING AS BIG A DECLINE THERE. YESTERDAY, WHEN MAJOR INDICES DECLINED, THE S & P EQUAL WEIGHT INDEX WAS HIGHER. THE YIELDS ARE COMING DOWN. WE HAVE A BIG AUCTION OF TWENTY-YEAR BONDS LATER ON, SO IN AN HOUR. AND CRUDE OIL AS WELL AS RENT UP NOW, UP TO 63-44 AFTER AN INDUSTRY SIGNALED DECLINE IN U.S. INVENTORIES. LET'S GET TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. BLOOMBERG REPORTED THAT THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY DIRECTORS URGING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK. THIS MARKS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF MOVES BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO STEP UP LEGAL SCRUTINY OF DEMOCRATIC FIGURES AND APPOINTEES. IN RESPONSE TO THE REPORT, PRESIDENT TRUMP DEMANDED THAT LISA COOK RESIGN. THAT STORY WAS REPORTED BY BLOOMBERG AND EVEN LINKED TO BY THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. JOSH JOINS US NOW FROM WASHINGTON WITH MORE. HE WANTS AN INVESTIGATION INTO LISA COOK'S MORTGAGES. WHAT DID SHE DO THAT GOT HIS ATTENTION? > > IT IS NOT CLEAR. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER DOJ WILL PICK THIS UP, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT POSITIVE INDICATION WOULD SUGGEST THAT PEER WHAT IS AT STAKE IS HER DECLARING TWO PROPERTIES PRIMARY RESIDENCES WITHIN THE SPAN OF A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN NAMED HER TO THE FED. SHE HAS SINCE BEEN REAPPOINTED TO A FULL TERM, BUT SHE TOOK A MORTGAGE ON A MICHIGAN PROPERTY ACCORDING TO THIS CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO THE DOJ, NO INVESTIGATION YET, NO CHARGES, AND THEY TOOK THAT MONEY AND TWO WEEKS LATER TOOK ANOTHER MORTGAGE ON A PROPERTY IN GEORGIA AND IN BOTH CASES THE MORTGAGE DOCUMENT SIGNALS SHE HAD TO MAKE IT HER PRIMARY RESIDENCE. WITHIN 60 DAYS AND FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR, SO THE TIMELINES WOULD SUGGEST THAT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE, TO MAKE BOTH FOR THE FULL YEAR YOUR 5 -- YOUR PRIMARY RESIDENCE. SHE LISTED THE GEORGIA PROPERTY FOR RENT, PART OF BILL PULTE'S COMPLAINT BECAUSE RENTAL PROPERTIES OFTEN HAVE A DIFFERENT MORTGAGE RATE. THE BACK STORY HERE IS TWOFOLD. TRUMP IS AT WAR WITH THE FED ESSENTIALLY, MOUNTING A PRESSURE CAMPAIGN FOR LOWER RATES, CRITICIZING POWELL. THIS IS A NEW FRONT IN THAT BATTLE. SECONDLY, TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER DEMOCRATS, IN PARTICULAR ON ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD. ADAM SCHIFF, WHO WAS A BIG FIGURE IN THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIALS. THIS IS IN SOME WAYS AN EXTENSION OF BOTH THINGS. TRUMP IS USING GOVERNMENT ESSENTIALLY TO LOOK INTO THESE THINGS AND FIND WHAT THEY SAY ARE ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD, ESSENTIALLY SAYING YOU LIVE IN A HOUSE TO A LOWER MORTGAGE RATE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY IF YOU ARE NOT OCCUPYING IT YOURSELF AS OWNER. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW, TRUMP CALLING ON HER TO RESIGN, SOME REPORTING THAT TRUMP HIMSELF IS CONSIDERING FIRING HER FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. THAT IS NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW. BILL PULTE IS SUGGESTING THAT SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE, BUT THINGS ARE SWIRLING NOW. ONE THING WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM LISA COOK SINCE THE STORY BROKE ABOUT 12 HOURS AGO. SCARLET: LISA COOK FIRST JOINED THE FED IN 20 22. HOW LONG IS HER TERM? > > UNTIL 2038, SO SHE HAS A LOT OF RUNWAY LEFT. THE QUESTION IS WILL SHE BOW TO PRESSURE IN RESIGN? WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A SURPRISE EARLY RESIGNATION WITH ANOTHER BITE AND APPOINTEES, BUT SHE WAS LEAVING A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HER TERM WAS UP. WITH COOK, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YEARS AND YEARS. IF SHE DID STEP AWAY OR IF TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE HER, WITH HER -- WHETHER THAT WOULD TRIGGER A LEGAL FIGHT IS UNCLEAR. THAT WILL GIVE TRUMP TWO SEATS TO FILL ON A BOARD. HE IS APPOINTING AIDES AND ALLIES TEMPORARILY TO FILL THE SEAT UNTIL JANUARY, SO POWELL HIMSELF LEAVING IN MAY AS CHAIR, NOT NECESSARILY AS BOARD MEMBER. THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PIECES, BUT THE FED COULD LOOK DIFFERENT A YEAR FROM NOW. SCARLET: SO FAR AS WE KNOW, PAM BONDI HAS NOT INDICATED WHETHER SHE WILL FURTHER INVESTIGATE LISA COOK. THE FED ALSO COMING UNDER FIRE FROM A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CENTRAL BANK CHAIR ROLE. HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT THE FED HAS NEVER BEEN INDEPENDENT AND THE POLITICAL PRESSURES ON THE POLITICAL PRESSURES ON THE FED HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GROWING AND CONTINUE TO GROW. HE WOULD ON -- WENT ON TO SAY POWELL IS OPERATING FROM THE ANTI-TRUMP SIDE. FOR A TAKE ON HOW THE FED DRAMA MIGHT PLAY INTO INVESTING DECISIONS, I WANT TO BRING IN THE HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY TRADING STRATEGY AT CITIGROUP. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I KNOW THAT YOU AND DAVID HAVE SIMILAR SOUNDING TITLES BUT YOU FOCUS ON EQUITIES. I WONDER HOW YOU FACTOR IN PRESSURES ON THE FED, POLITICAL PRESSURES WE ARE SEEING. AND TRUMP'S WAR ON THE FED INTO YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND CALL FOR THE S & P 500. > > I DO NOT THINK IT AFFECTS OUR VIEW ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE FED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE FED HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT THEY WILL BE DATA-DEPENDENT AND WE WILL TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD. THE MARKET WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE THIS DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE, BUT IF YOU LISTED ALL THE UNCERTAINTY IS, FED UNCERTAINTY WOULD NOT BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. IT MATTERS, ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF A WRINKLE TODAY TODAY HEADLINES, BUT WE DO NOT THINK IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON FED POLICY. SCARLET: DO YOU SEE IT BECOMING A BIGGER ISSUE IF THIS PICKS UP? STUART: IF THE ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO FIRE POWELL, THAT WOULD GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. IF THEY DECIDE ON A SUCCESSOR TO THE FED CHAIR AND THAT PERSON WAS VOCALLY TRYING TO QUESTION FED DECISIONS, THAT COULD ADD TO UNCERTAINTY, BUT OUR VIEW IS THIS IS PROBABLY NOT YOUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN IF YOU'RE AN EQUITY INVESTOR. POWELL WAS A TRUMP APPOINTEE. SCARLET: THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT. OAKTREE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT WAS ON BLOOMBERG TODAY AND HE WAS FLOGGING THAT STOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE. > > I AM NOT RAISING AN ALARM BELL, BUT I THINK IT IS TIME FOR CAUTION. I THINK THERE WILL BE A CORRECTION SOON, BUT THE POINT IS THAT THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE. THEY MAY GO ON TO BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT THE FACT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE SHOULD NOT BE LOST. SCARLET: HE SAID THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THERE WILL BE A CORRECTION SOON, BUT WE ARE SEEING A SELLOFF IN TECH STOCKS FOR THE NASDAQ 100. HOW WOULD YOU READ INTO THAT? STUART: INTO THE MOVE? VALUATION IS HIGH HISTORICALLY. OUR VIEW IS VALUATION MATTERS IF YOU ARE A MEDIUM OR LONG-TERM INVESTOR. VALUATION I THINK GIVES YOU A POORER RISK FOR WARD ON MARKETS AS OPPOSED TO A RECENT TO SELL. IN TERMS OF TECH SELLOFF TODAY, THERE IS NOT A SMOKING GUN HERE AS TO WHY WE HAVE SEEN PRESSURE THE LAST COUPLE DAYS SO A LOT OF THIS IS POSITIONING ITSELF -- NVIDIA WAS UP 31% SINCE THE LAST EARNINGS REPORT. WE JUST GOT THROUGH A HEAVY EARNINGS SEASON. NO REASON NECESSARILY FOR A NEAR-TERM SELLOFF, BUT YOU DO HAVE POOR SEASONALITY. INVESTORS ARE AWARE OF THAT, SO THIS DOES FEEL LIKE A POSITION DRIVEN MOVE. RETAIL FAVORITE SOCKS -- STOCKS HAVE SOLD OFF, THINGS I WOULD CALL FOR POSITIONS IN A LOT OF PORTFOLIOS. WITHOUT A CLEAR CATALYST, THIS SEEMS SENTIMENT DRIVEN. WHAT COULD GET WORSE WOULD BE BAD NEWS FRIDAY FROM THE FED OR POTENTIALLY DISAPPOINTING EARNINGS FROM NVIDIA. WITHOUT THAT, YOU WOULD EXPECT MUCH OF THE POSITIONING TO BURN OUT OVER A SHORT TIME. SCARLET: DO YOU THINK THE MARKET IS PRICING IN JAY POWELL NOT COMMITTING TO A LOT, SAYING HE IS WATCHING THE DATA OR COULD THERE BE ROOM FOR SOME KIND OF SURPRISE? STUART: ABOUT A 75 BASIS POINT MOVE FOR THE S & P -- THIS IS LIGHT ON FRIDAY. I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE HOPING FOR A NOTHING TYPE EVENT. THE RISK IS A LITTLE BIT TO THE HAWKISH SIDE, BUT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY HIGHLIGHT. IF THEY HIGHLIGHT INFLATION AND CONSUMER SENTIMENT VERSUS PAYROLL AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT, YOU COULD GET DIFFERENT RESPONSE BUT OUR VIEW WOULD BE IT IS AN IMPORTANT EVENT, NOT AS IMPORTANT AS FOMC, BUT EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE A QUIET FRIDAY. SCARLET: THAT IS IMPORTANT, THE CONTEXT. EARNINGS SEASON IS LARGELY OVER AND YOU HAVE TWO BIG EVENTS COMING UP. JAY POWELL'S SPEECH FRIDAY AT NVIDIA EARNINGS NEXT WEEK. YOU MENTION HOW PEOPLE ARE TAKING A BREATHER HERE. IS THE MEME STOCK FRENZY OVER? WE ARE NOT SEEING BUY THE DIP COME IN AS AGGRESSIVELY AS EARLIER THIS MONTH. STUART: IT IS HARD TO SAY THE MEME STOCK FRENZY IS OVER. THE STOCKS THAT YOU CALL MEME STOCKS MIGHT EVOLVE. RETAIL WILL BE PLAYING A SMALLER PART IN THE MARKET. AI IS STILL VIEWED AS A MUST-HAVE IN YOUR PORTFOLIO. THESE THINGS ARE NOT GOING AWAY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT MONTH, YOU HAVE FOUR MAJOR EVENTS. YOU HAVE POWELL FRIDAY AND THEN NVIDIA AND PAYROLL AND CPI AND THEN WE GET ANOTHER FOMC MEETING. BETWEEN THOSE EVENTS, THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING PRICED. IT FEELS LIKE A BY APPOINTMENT MARKETS AND THOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE PRETTY EASY. WE DO NOT THINK RETAIL PULLBACK. THIS IS A BLIP IN THE ROAD UNTIL WE SEE SOMETHING MEANINGFUL ON THE FUNDAMENTAL SIDE OF THINGS. THAT WOULD BE WEAKNESS IN EARNINGS OR ON OTHER WEEK LABOR MARKET REPORT. THOSE THINGS COULD CHANGE THE DYNAMIC, BUT WE ARE NOT THERE YET. SCARLET: WHERE IS THEIR VALUE TO BE FOUND IN THIS MARKET? IS IT IN THE SMALL CAPS, WHICH TRY TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF A LEFT AND THEN FAIL? STUART: WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY LOWER QUALITY VALUE STOCKS. WE HAVE SEEN BURSTS OF THIS ACTIVITY OVER THE LAST 12 TO 18 MONTHS. THEY HAVE GENERALLY FADED BECAUSE OF EARNINGS. THOSE COMPANIES ARE GENERATING GROWTH. THE REST OF THE S & P IS IN THE MID SINGLE DIGITS. TO SEE LEGS IN THAT TRADE, YOU WOULD HAVE TO SIRI ACCELERATION IN U.S. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. WE TOOK A THREE-MONTH BREAK BECAUSE OF TARIFF UNCERTAINTY AND WE ARE GOING TO REHIRE -- THAT IS NOT A BASE CASE BUT THE TYPE OF ACCELERATION AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY YOU NEED TO SEE FOR THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE IN SMALL CAPS. SCARLET: WHAT IS THE ONE THING YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT, IF SOMETHING WEIGHS ON YOU? STUART: OUR NUMBER ONE RISK IS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE THE ENTIRE YEAR. WE HAVE HAD THREE MONTHS OF WEEK PAYROLLS. WE SAW THREE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS LAST SUMMER AS WELL, SO IT DOES FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN A HIRING STRIKE RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE JUST NOT REPLACING FOLKS THAT ARE LEFT. THAT COULD BE TARIFF UNCERTAINTY. IT COULD BE LET'S SEE IF AI CAN DO THAT JOB. THE BIG RISK WOULD BE LATER THIS YEAR AND YOU GET A MEANINGFUL UPTICK IN ON A PLANET RATE. THAT IS NOT THE BASE CASE AND WE COULD ARGUE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, BUT THE NUMBER ONE RISK WOULD BE LABOR MARKET. SCARLET: THANK YOU. COMING UP, NEW DISCLOSURES SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BOUGHT HUNDREDS OF BONDS THROUGH THE LAST YEAR, CORPORATE BONDS. WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK INTO HIS LATEST EFFORT TO BUILD HIS PERSONAL WEALTH WHILE IN OFFICE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. THIS IS BOOMBERG MARKETS, I\u2019M SCARLET FU. SEEING THE S & P 500 DECLINED FOR A FOURTH STRAIGHT DAY. LET'S HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MOVERS. > > NVIDIA STOCK IS DOWN BY 1.5% AFTER A 3.5% DECLINE YESTERDAY. I HAVE TO POINT OUT THIS IS A BROADER SELLOFF IN THE SO-CALLED MOMENTUM STOCKS, WHICH INCLUDE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RELATED COMPANIES. A FEW REASONS BEHIND THAT EVALUATION POSITIONING. SOME PEOPLE ARE TAKING MONEY OFF THE TABLE AHEAD OF NVIDIA RESULTS AND THERE ARE CONCERNS IN VOLATILITY AHEAD OF THE JACKSON HOLE MEETING. THE NEXT ONE IS RETAIL SPACE. SHARES OF TARGET ARE DOWN BY 7.3%. THE COMPANY NAMED ITS COO AS THE NEXT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE STOCK PRICE REACTION SHOWS WALL STREET WAS HOPING FOR AN OUTSIDER FOR THIS JOB. IN TERMS OF EARNINGS, THEY WERE BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND ALSO TARGET MAINTAINED ITS GUIDANCE. SHARES OF A DISCOUNTER ARE DROPPING BY 3.2%. THIS IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL ON RECORD. THE COMPANY RAISED OUTLOOK, POSTED BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED RESULTS. THIS IS A SIGNAL THAT SHOPPERS ARE TURNING TO DISCOUNTERS AS WORRIES ABOUT TARIFFS AND INFLATION ARE GROWING. SCARLET: I LOVE T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALL'S. TODAY'S EQUITY MOVERS. FROM EQUITIES TO BONDS. THERE ARE NEW DISCLOSURES THAT SO -- SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BOUGHT MORE THAN $1 MILLION OF CORPORATE BONDS SINCE RETURNING TO OFFICE, INCLUDING THOSE SOLD BY QUALCOMM HOME DEPOT AND META, ALL U.S. COMPANIES AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO FEDERAL POLICIES THAT HE HAS CHAMPIONED. HERE WITH MORE ON ALL OF THIS IS BILL ELLISON FROM WASHINGTON. THIS IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE THIS IS HIS SECOND TERM IN OFFICE BUT WE HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A DISCLOSURE LIKE THIS BEFORE. HOW DID WE LEARN OF THESE PURCHASES? > > FEDERAL OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT HAVE TO REPORT WHEN THEY BUY CERTAIN TYPES OF ASSETS. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NO EXCEPTION. THINGS LIKE BONDS, STOCKS. YOU HAVE TO REPORT THOSE. THE WHITE HOUSE BASICALLY -- HE SIGNED THIS ON AUGUST 12 AND IT WENT UP ON THE WHITE HOUSE WEBSITE YESTERDAY. WE NOTICED IT AND LOOKED INTO IT. SCARLET: HE DID NOT COME AS FAR AS WE KNOW CANNOT BUY ANY CORPORATE BONDS IN HIS FIRST TERM IN OFFICE. CAN YOU PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIS PERSONAL HOLDINGS? > > HE DID NOT HOLD A LOT OF MUNICIPAL BONDS DURING HIS FIRST TERM. WE NOTICE WHEN HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT THE THIRD TIME, CANDIDATES HAVE TO FILE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES AND THERE WERE A LOT MORE HOLDINGS AND MOSTLY MUNICIPAL EQUITIES -- BONDS, BUT HE ALSO -- THIS IS KIND OF UNUSUAL BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN HIM BUYING JUST A HANDFUL OF CORPORATE BONDS. SCARLET: WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BUSINESS INTERESTS, I THINK ABOUT MAR-A-LAGO AND HIS GOLF RESORTS, WHICH HE JUST VISITED IN SCOTLAND THIS MONTH. I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE TRUMP MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, WHICH HOUSES THE TRUTH SOCIAL NETWORK, AND HIS CRYPTO VENTURES. HOW DOES THAT FACTOR INTO ALL OF THIS? > > HIS BUSINESS EMPIRE IS PROBABLY PRODUCING A LOT OF INCOME. THIS IS NOT HIM MOVING MONEY AROUND. THIS IS A PRETTY HUGE BOND PURCHASE AND MORE THAN 690 TRANSACTIONS THAT HE REPORTED STARTING THE DAY AFTER HE WAS INAUGURATED AND I THINK THAT HIS BUSINESS EMPIRE IS -- IT IS THROWN OFF MUCH MORE MONEY THIS TIME THAN IT DID IN HIS FIRST TERM. CRYPTO IS A HUGE PART OF THAT. FROM TECHNOLOGY -- TRUMP TECHNOLOGY GROUP IS A HUGE PART OF HIS NET WEALTH. HE WAS JUST TRAVELING ABROAD PROMOTING HIS GOLF COURSES IN SCOTLAND, SO CLEARLY BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN BAD IN TRUMP'S SECOND TERM. SCARLET: THIS DISCLOSURES LIKE A SNAPSHOT, NOT REALLY A PICTURE OF HOW THINGS HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME. DO WE KNOW IF HE IS BUYING -- IF HE IS A BUY-AND-HOLD KIND OF GUY OR COULD HE BE TRADING FREQUENTLY? > > IF HE WERE TRADING, YOU WOULD SEE SOME SALES AS WELL AS PURCHASES. THIS DOCUMENT WAS 690 PURCHASES, SO HE IS BASICALLY INVESTING AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW HE IS HOLDING ONTO THEM CANNOT REPORTING -- HE WOULD BE REPORTING SALES IF YOU WERE TRADING AND SWAPPING THINGS OUT. SCARLET: THANK YOU SO MUCH, BLOOMBERG'S BILL ALLISON WITH THE LATEST ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CORPORATE BOND PURCHASES. BLOOMBERG IN ALASKA'S NEW PROGRAM LET'S USERS PICK THEIR OWN PLAN. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a SCARLET: ALASKA AIR IS DEBUTING A NEW LOYALTY PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FLYERS TO PICK THEIR PLAN, WITH THE OPTION TO EARN BASED ON DISTANCE, PRICE, OR NUMBER OF SEGMENTS. FOR US. IS THIS GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS? > > THIS IS AWESOME. MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. IT IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES I DID NOT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WHEN I NEW CHANGES WERE COMING AND CRINGE AND DREAD IT. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD STUFF. LOTS OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EARN STATUS. I THINK IT WILL BE A GREAT PROGRAM FOR MOST FOLKS. SCARLET: DID THEY DEVALUE ANY POINTS AS THEY ABSORB HAWAIIAN AND THAT COMPANY'S PROGRAM? > > NO. THAT IS THE REMARKABLE THING. USUALLY THEY SAY IT IS FOR CUSTOMER REASONS BUT IT IS REALLY DEVALUATION. THAT IS NOT TRUE IN THIS CASE. I THINK ALASKA WANTS TO BE THE BEST MILEAGE PROGRAM, BEST LOYALTY PROGRAM, AND THE CHANGES THEY ARE UNVEILING GIVE THEM A HEAD START, SO MUCH SO THAT I'M GOING TO SWITCH MY LOYALTY OVER TO THE ALASKA PROGRAM. SCARLET: THAT IS PRETTY TELLING SINCE YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS THAN ANYONE ELSE THE CONTEXT HERE IS THAT ALASKA AIR IS PUSHING TO BECOME A GLOBAL AIRLINE. I WAS AT THEIR HUB AND THEY HAD ADVERTISEMENTS ABOUT DIRECT FLIGHTS TO TOKYO, TO KYOTO. HOW DOES THIS PLAY INTO THAT? HOW EASY OR DIFFICULT IS IT TO GET A FREE OVERSEAS TICKETS, FOR INSTANCE? BILL: IT IS INTERESTING. THIS OPENS THE WORLD TO ALASKA AND HAWAII. NOW ALASKA IS GOING TO FLY TO CITIES LIKE ROME, TOKYO, AND THEY ARE EXPANDING DRAMATICALLY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. THEY WILL HAVE 12 INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS PRETTY SOON. THEY ARE TAKING DELIVERY OF MORE BIG DREAMLINER JETS AND I THINK THIS IS AN INTERESTING PROGRAM. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TOP-TIER LEADS WITH ALASKA ARE GOING TO BE GIVEN FREE UPGRADES INTERNATIONALLY. NO OTHER PROGRAM HAS DONE THAT BEFORE. THIS IS A GENEROUS PROGRAM. WILL IT LAST FOREVER? I AM NOT SURE. FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS, IT WILL BE GREAT. SCARLET: IT IS NOT GOING TO LAST FOREVER. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW LONG THE OFFER IS GOOD FOR, DO YOU THINK? BILL: I DO NOT HAVE INSIDER KNOWLEDGE ON THIS BUT I THINK BENEFITS ARE SO GENEROUS FOR THIS PROGRAM THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OFFERING AS GENEROUS A PROGRAM GOING FORWARD JUST FOR COMPETITIVE REASONS, SO WE WILL SEE. I THINK THAT IS YEARS DOWN THE LINE AND FOR NOW CONSUMERS SHOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS. THEY ALSO HAVE THREE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN QUALIFY FOR STATUS, WHICH IS INTERESTING. YOU CAN DO IT BASED ON DISTANCE STILL, THE LAST PROGRAM, WHERE IF YOU ARE FLYING A LOT INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS ON CHEAP TICKETS YOU COULD QUALIFY WITH JUST DISTANCE FLOWN THERE ALSO ALLOW YOU TO PICK REVENUE, SO IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS TRAVELER WHOSE COMPANIES BOOKING A LOT OF LAST-MINUTE NEW TICKETS YOU CAN QUALIFY THAT WAY FAIRLY EASILY. FOR FOLKS JUST FLYING WITHIN IN CALIFORNIA AND ALASKA AND HAWAII , YOU CAN QUALIFY ON SEGMENTS. SO REALLY INNOVATIVE CHANGES HERE, REALLY EXCITING FOR BUSINESS TRAVELERS AND CONSUMERS. SCARLET: IT SOUNDS GREAT ON THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SWITCHING TO ALASKA AIRLINES SHOULD BE INDICATIVE COMPARED TO OTHER LOYALTY PROGRAMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. CLINT HENDERSON IS A MANAGING EDITOR. WE ARE GOING TO HEAD LIVE TO JACKSONVILLE, WYOMING. FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a SCARLET: WELCOME TO \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" I AM SCARLET FU. LET\u2019S GET A QUICK LOOK AT WHERE THINGS STAND. YOU WITH THE S & P 500 LOWER BY A THIRD OF A PERCENT. IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON AN EQUAL WEIGHTED BASIS, IT\u2019S .1%. THAT IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE WEAKNESS IS IN THE MEGA TECH CAP NAMES. IN FACT, MARKING ITS FIRST BACK-TO-BACK DECLINE OF MORE THAN 1% SINCE THE LIBERATION DAY SELL-OFF IN EARLY APRIL. WE ARE SEEING YIELDS DOWN ACROSS THE CURVE. THERE IS GOING TO BE A BIG BOND AUCTION IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES TIME. $16 BILLION OF THE 20 YEAR ONES WHICH TEND TO BE LESS POPULAR WITH INVESTORS. THE YIELD LOWER ON THE TWO YEAR TO 3.71%. W.T.I. HIGHER THIS AFTERNOON AS AN INDUSTRY REPORT SIGNALED A DECLINE IN U.S. INVENTORIES LAST WEEK. ALL RIGHT. LET\u2019S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES ARE FARING THIS AFTERNOON. I WAS GOING TO SAY MORNING BUT WE HAVE MOVED INTO THE AFTERNOON. MICRON SHARES TUMBLING FOLLOWING REPORTS THAT SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS HAS PASSED EARLY TESTING FOR ITS HIGH BANDWIDTH MEMORY CHIPS SO IT COULD CAM UCH TO RIVALS IN THE A.I. CHIP RACE AND PERHAPS WIN KEY DEALS WITH NVIDIA. LET\u2019S LOOK AT SHARES OF PALANEIR ON TRACK FOR THE SIXTH STRAIGHT DAY OF LOSSES AFTER RESEARCH SAYS THE STOCK IS WORTH $40 IN A POST ON X. COMPARE THAT TO THE CURRENT $152. EARLIER IT WAS CALLED A HIGH MULTIPLE HYPE DRIVEN NARRATIVE. FINALLY WE ARE LOOKING AT SHARES OF JAMES HARDY, THAT IS ON THE DECLINE AS WELL. A SIZABLE 35% PLUNGE AFTER THE BUILDING MATERIALS MAKER REPORTED NET SALES THAT MISSED ANALYSTS\u2019 ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY WARNED OF WEAK DEMAND FOR REPAIRS AND NEW CONSTRUCTION IN NORTH AMERICA. THIS BY THE WAY MARKS THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY DECLINE SINCE 1973. LET\u2019S GO BACK TO OUR TOP STORY. THIS IS THE HEAD LINE THAT WAS FIRST REPORTED BY BLOOMBERG. TRUMP DEMANDS FED\u2019S LISA COOK QUIT. BILL PULTE SEEKS MORTGAGE PROBE. THE PRESIDENT RESPONDING TO THE BLOOMBERG REPORT THIS MORNING, POSTING THAT COOK MUST RESIGN NOW. SO OF COURSE WE NEED SOME CONTEXT ON ALL OF THIS. WHO WETTER -- BETTER THAN TO ASK BLOOMBERG\u2019S MIKE MCKEE LIVE IN WYOMING WHERE HE WILL BE COVERING THE JACKSON HOLE ECONOMIC SYMPOSIUM HOSTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. I KNOW OFFICIALS HAVE NOT YET ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, BUT I IMAGINE THIS WILL BE A BIG TALKING POINT, THE IDEA THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u2019S WAR ON THE FED CONTINUES. THIS TIME IT HAS SPREAD TO LISA COOK. WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE ISSUE IS WITH LISA COOK? > > WELL, THE ISSUE IS THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AUTHORITY DIRECTOR, BILL PULTE, DISCOVERED THE MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS THAT LISA COOK FILED IN 2021 FOR TWO SEPARATE HOUSES, ONE IN MICHIGAN AND ONE IN GEORGIA. IN EACH SHE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE HER PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND IF SHE DIDN\u2019T KEEP UP WITH THAT, IT MIGHT BE ILLEGAL. HE SENT THAT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, PAM BONDI, AND SAID YOU SHOULD INVESTIGATE WHAT THE STORY IS HERE AND MAYBE BRING CHARGES. OF COURSE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO ATTACK DEMOCRATS. HE DID THE SAME THING WITH ADAM SCHIFF, THE SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA AND WITH THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE DIFFERENCE IS HERE THAT LISA COOK IS A DEMOCRAT APPOINTED BY A DEMOCRAT, BUT SHE HAS NOT BEEN AN ENEMY OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AT LEAST NOT PUBLICLY. SHE\u2019S NOT A SWING VOTE ON THE FED. SO AT THIS POINT, IT ISN\u2019T CLEAR EXACTLY WHY THEY\u2019RE GOING AFTER HER OTHER THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING ANOTHER OPEN BOARD SEAT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD FILL. THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AFTER THE STORY BROKE AND TWEETED THAT SHE SHOULD RESIGN IMMEDIATELY AND PULTE SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESIDENT NOW HAS CAUSE TO FIRE HER. REMEMBER, FED GOVERNORS CAN ONLY BE FIRED FOR CAUSE, WHICH WAS UNDERSCORED BY THE SUPREME COURT EARLIER THIS YEAR. SCARLET: HER TERM LASTS FOR A WHILE AS WELL. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER STANCE ON MONETARY POLICY? MICHAEL: SHE HAS BEEN A LOYAL SUPPORTER OF JAY POWELL AND OF THE MAJORITY. SHE\u2019S VOTED WITH THE MAJORITY IN EVERY CASE SINCE SHE TOOK HER SEAT ON THE BOARD, AND SHE WOULD BE CONSIDERED AT LEAST A MILD HAWK, AN FLAKES SH -- AN INFLATION HAWK. THE DIFFERENCE IS KIND OF SMALL, IT\u2019S A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU THINK THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING ENOUGH TO GET ANOTHER -- TO GET A RATE CUT. BUT SHE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE RATES UNCHANGED IN SEPTEMBER IF THAT\u2019S WHAT THE MAJORITY WAS DOING. SCARLET: OF COURSE, AT THE HEARTS OF THIS IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IT\u2019S NOT JUST FED OFFICIALS WHO WILL BE DESCENDING UPON JACKSONVILLE. YOU ALSO HAVE LAGUARD AS WELL AS BAILEY, THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND. HOW MUCH DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO TALK ABOUT CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS THIS WEEK? MICHAEL: WELL, BLOOMBERG\u2019S REPORTER WROTE A STORY THAT SUGGESTED FROM HER CONTACTS WITH THOSE EUROPEAN POLICYMAKERS THAT THEY DO INTEND TO BRING UP THE IDEA OF FED INDEPENDENCE AND SUGGEST IT\u2019S VERY IMPORTANT FOR A CENTRAL BANK TO NOT BOW TO POLITICAL PRESSURE, IN A WAY TRYING TO SUPPORT JAY POWELL IN HIS HOUR OF NEED. I DON\u2019T THINK THEY\u2019LL GO SO FAR AS TO CALL OUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT THEY MAY MAKE REMARKS THAT WOULD HINT AT CENTRAL BANK SOLIDARITY AS IT WERE, WHEN THEY ARE HERE. SCARLET: WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR THAT. MIKE MCKEE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL BE CHECKING IN WITH YOU OVER THE COURSE OF THE REST OF THE WEEK. NOW LET\u2019S SHIFT GEARS AND TALK ABOUT SOME DEAL MAKING BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT SHARES OF DAY FORCE RISING. YOU CAN SEE UP ABOUT 2.7%, THIS AFTER THE HUMAN RESOURCES SOFTWARE PROVIDER CONFIRMED BLOOMBERG\u2019S REPORTING THAT IT IS IN ADVANCE TALKS TO BE SOLD TO A P.E. FIRM. THE POTENTIAL DEAL WOULD BE ONE OF THOMAS BRAVO\u2019S LARGEST EVER DEALS. HERE WITH MORE IS U.S. DEALS MANAGING EDITOR. WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? > > THIS IS GOING TO BE THEIR BIGGEST DEAL SHOULD IT GOAT THE FINISH LINE. THE STOCK WORTH $70 A SHARE WOULD BE VALUED OVER $11 BILLION EQUITY VALUE BUT IF YOU ADD ON THE DEBT ON THE COMPANY, WE ARE TALKING BIG NUMBERS, OVER $1 BILLION IN DEBT. WE DON\u2019T SEE THIS EVERY DAY, COMPANIES CONFIRMING OUR REPORTS, BUT WE LOVE TO SEE IT AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IT\u2019S NOT SUPER COMMON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN BUT IT\u2019S POSSIBLE. INVESTORS WANTED TO KNOW AT WHAT PRICE WOULD THIS DEAL BE AND NOW THEY ANSWERED THAT QUESTION, $70 A SHARE. SCARLET: CONGRATULATIONS TO BLOOMBERG\u2019S DEALS TEAM FOR GETTING IT FIRST. THE APPAREL MAKER GUESS IS GOING TO GO PRIVATE IN A $1.4 BILLION DEAL WITH AUTHENTIC. HOW SURPRISING IS THIS GIVEN THAT IT IS NO LONGER ONE OF THE MORE FASHIONABLE BRANDS AND PERHAPS HAS BEEN STRUGGLING A BIT? > > SO I THINK BLOOMBERG HAD REPORTED THAT AUTHENTIC BRANDS WAS LOOKING AT A BID FOR GUESS, SO IT\u2019S NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING. ONE OF THEIR COMPETITORS HAD ALSO TRIED TO BID ON GUEST, SO MAYBE IT WAS A BIDDING WAR. BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT AUTHENTIC BRANDS MAY NOT BE A HOUSEHOLD NAME BUT THEY OWN A STABLE OF BRANDS THAT ARE HOUSEHOLDS NAMES, CHAMPION, NINE WEST AND MORE. SO THIS REALLY JUST FITS IN NICELY WITH THESE BRANDS THAT PEOPLE KNOW AND RETAIL IS A REALLY CHALLENGED SPACE RIGHT NOW SO THEY\u2019VE SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY TO ROLL UP ALL OF THESE NAMES. SCARLET: TO WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER ABOUT STRUGGLING, GUESS\u2019 SALES FOR 2024 DECLINED 46%. IT\u2019S EXPECTED TO RECOVER $17% FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. FINALLY YOU ARE ALSO LOOKING AT HONEYWELL, RAISING MONEY FOR QUANTUM COMPUTING FIRM, THIS IS A FIRM THAT IT HAD A STAKE IN. > > HONEYWELL OWNS 50% OF QUANTINIUM, A REALLY EXCITING TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE STILL A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM IT BEING FULLY ADOPTED BUT IT CONNECTS TO A.I. AND IT\u2019S GOING TO SORT OF REPLACE CLASSICAL COMPUTING AS THEY CALL IT. THIS COMPANY HAS BEEN VALUED AT $10 BILLION BEFORE, BUT THEY\u2019RE LOOKING TO BRING IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. HONEYWELL AS THEIR BIGGEST BACKER IS ALSO LOOKING AT PUT INNING MORE MONEY. SCARLET: HOW DOES THIS FIT IN WITH HONEYWELL\u2019S PLAN TO SPLIT ITSELF INTO SEPARATE COMPANIES? > > THIS WAS ALWAYS A SEPARATE COMPANY AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD LOOKED AT TAKING IT PUBLIC, SO WE ARE GOING TO BE CHECKING IN TO SEE WHAT THOSE PLANS ARE NOW THAT THERE IS TALK OF A CAPITAL RAISE. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING SINCE HONEYWELL IS SPLITTING TO SO MANY COMPANIES. THIS COB ANOTHER -- COULD BE ANOTHER PUBLIC COMPANY HONEYWELL IS CONNECTED TO. SCARLET: YOU FOUND THAT NVIDIA IS AMONG THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PERHAPS INTERESTED IN INVESTING IN THIS COMPANY. > > QUANTUM COMPUTING COMPANIES HAVE A LOT OF PARTNERSHIPS WITH NVIDIA. THEY USE THE CHIPS. THERE IS A LOT OF COMPUTING POWER NEEDED FOR THESE ALGORITHMS TO RUN. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT A COMPANY LIKE NVIDIA WOULD BE APPROACHED WHEN THERE IS A BIG FUNDING ROUND IN THIS SPACE. SCARLET: GOOD STUFF. IN TERMS OF THE BIGGER PICTURE OF M & A, THERE WAS A LOT OF ANTICIPATION WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IT\u2019S MORE PRO-BUSINESS APPROACH, WE COULD GET A SPARK. IT TOOK A WHILE BUT IT HAS FINALLY GOTTEN STARTED. WHAT SECTORS ARE YOU SEEING THE MOST ACTIVITIES IN? INVESTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW FINANCIALS ARE DUE FOR CONSOLIDATION. > > I WOULD SAY IT\u2019S ACROSS THE BOARD. THERE WAS THE LOWE\u2019S DEAL WHICH IS RETAIL INDUSTRIALS. FINANCIALS IS A TOUGHER SPACE. THERE STILL IS A LOT OF REGULATION AROUND IT, BUT WE DID SEE A JOANAL BANK -- REGIONAL BANK DEAL RECENTLY. WE ARE BUSY, CAN\u2019T BELIEVE IT\u2019S AUGUST. MY WHOLE TEAM IS IN THE OFFICE WORKING -- > > NOT A NORMAL AUGUST. > > NO, THIS IS NOT NORMAL. IT\u2019S GREAT TO SEE THESE DEALS GET TO THE FINISH LINE OR TALKS OF DEALS GETTING CONFIRMED, REALLY A GOOD SIGN FOR THE MARKET. SCARLET: WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF THE PIPELINE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR? > > ONE AREA FOR THE PIPELINE THAT WE ARE LOOK AT, THE I.P.O. PIPELINE AFTER LABOR DAY THAT WILL BE BIG. BUT YEAH, JUST IN TERMS OF M & A, I THINK WITH THE TARIFFS THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WENT ON PAUSE AND NOW THEY\u2019RE COMING BACK. IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR DEAL DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THE FOURTH QUARTER IS THE TIME TO DO IT. SCARLET: WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A SPURT OF DEALS AT THE SAME TIME, THESE ARE DEALS THAT HAVE BEEN MONTHS IN THE MAKING. > > OR YEARS SOMETIMES. SCARLET: ABSOLUTELY. > > IT\u2019S LIKE A MARRIAGE APPARENTLY. SCARLET: THANK YOU SO MUCH, MANAGING EDITOR OF DEALS FOR BLOOMBERG NEWS. COMING UP ON \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS\" WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE RETAILERS BECAUSE CONSUMERS TRADE DOWN AND FLOCK TO DISCOUNTS. HOW LONG CAN THE OFF PRICE BOOM LAST? WE WILL BRING YOU MORE NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" I AM SCARLET FU. IT\u2019S TIME FOR OUR STOCK OF THE HOUR. WE ARE LOOKING AT SHARES OF T.J.X., THE COMPANY POSTED A BETTER THAN EXPECTED QUARTER. HERE WITH MORE IS ADRIENNE YIH, SENIOR RETAIL AMIST AT BARCLAYS. A PRICE TARGET OF $147. ADRIENNE, THE STOCK IS ALREADY AT $139 A RECORD HIGH. SO $147 IS NOT FAR FROM HERE AND THIS ALL GOES BACK TO THE IDEA THAT T.J.X. IS DOING THIS BETTER, OFF PRICE RETAILING THAN ITS PEERS. ADRIENNE: ABSOLUTELY. OUR PRICE TARGET AS OF PREPRINT, WHERE THE GUIDANCE IS ABOVE WHERE THE STREET IS, SO THAT\u2019S ALL GOOD NEWS. FORWARD EARNINGS ESTIMATES ARE BEING REVISED UPWARDS. THE COMPANY TOANDZ BE REALLY CONSERVATIVE SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE UPSIDE TO ALL THOSE NUMBERS AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE YEAR. YOU ARE RIGHT, THIS IS A STELLAR QUARTER. THIS IS REALLY AN ANOMALY IN A SEA OF RETAILERS. WE ARE ABOUT TO HEAR A LOT OF PRINT AND THE Q2\u2019S WILL BE GOOD WITH THE HEALTHY CONSUMER BUT WE EXPECT DOWNWARD REVISIONS UNDER THE TARIFF SCENARIO. SCARLET: RIGHT. PART OF IT IS THE BUSINESS MODEL IS GREAT. OFF PRICE IS ATTRACTIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE CONSUMER IS WORRIED, CONFUSE $, AND SEEKING VALUE. WHAT IS IT ABOUT T.J.X. IN PARTICULAR THAT SETS IT APART FROM ITS PEERS, BECAUSE THIS BUSINESS MODEL WORKS BUT THEY\u2019RE EXECUTING BETTER THAN THE OTHERS. > > I WOULD 100% AGREE WITH YOU. THIS IS A PATTERN OF NINE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS OF POSITIVE COMPS, YOWTS PERFORMING THE -- OUTPERFORMING THE RETAIL SPACE BUT EVEN A BURLINGTON AND ROSS. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE ARE THREE MAIN PLAYERS IN THE OFF PRICE SPACE. T.J.X. DOES FOCUS ON THE HIGHER HOUSEHOLD INCOME BRACKETS, ABOUT 3/4 OF THEIR BUSINESS ARE IN METROPOLITAN AREAS THAT HAVE $75,000 HOUSEHOLDS AND ABOVE. THE OTHER TWO PLAY KIND OF $50,000. SO THEY REALLY HAVE A TARGET MARKET THAT HAS A LOT MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT, IT\u2019S NOT JUST THAT THEY BEAT THE COMP. THEY PUT UP A +4. AT THEIR SIZE, THAT\u2019S $300 MILLION IN 90 DAYS THAT THEY ARE TAKING FROM SOMEPLACE. SCARLET: THAT IS REMARKABLE. WE KNOW WHO THEY\u2019RE TAKING IT FROM. THE OTHER THING ABOUT T.J.X. IS THAT IT IS INTERNATIONAL. THEY HAVE STORES IN EUROPE AS WELL. HOW MUCH MORE GROWTH IS THERE IN THE U.S. VERSUS OVERSEAS? ADRIENNE: IN THE U.S., THERE IS PROBABLY -- THEY\u2019RE VERY COMFORTABLE OPENING A NET NEW STORES IN THE 130 STORE PER YEAR RANGE, WHICH IS ABOUT 3% SQUARE FOOTAGE GROWTH FOR AT LEAST THE KNICKS THREE -- NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS. YOU WOULD SAY YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THE OVERINDEXING OF STORES WILL PROBABLY COME FROM EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, THEY\u2019RE DOING WELL THERE. I AGREE WITH YOU, THE NOTION OF OFF PRICE, WE DON\u2019T HAVE ENOUGH LIQUIDATION FIREPOWER FOR FRONTLINE RETAIL. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE OFF PRICES ARE THERE TO CLEAN UP INVENTORY ON BEHALF OF THE RETAILERS EVERY SEASON, EVERY YEAR. THERE IS REALLY ONLY THREE OF THEM. SO WE STILL THINK THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF LANDSCAPE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO OPEN SQUARE FOOTAGE EVEN IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO INTERNATIONALLY. SCARLET: NOW, OF COURSE, T.J.X.\u2019S VALUE PROPOSITION IS IT GIVES CONSUMERS A GREAT DEAL. IF THE RETAILERS THAT IT ENDS UP BUYING EXCESS INVENTORY FROM RAISE THEIR PRICES, DOES T.J.X. PASS ALONG THOSE COSTS, HIGHER PRICES TO CONSUMERS, OR DOES IT HAVE ROOM TO NOT HAVE TO DO THAT? ADRIENNE: THAT\u2019S FANTASTIC QUESTION AND THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE BUSINESS MODEL. THEY DON\u2019T HAVE TO. THEY HAVE THE OPTIONALITY TO. IN THE EVENT -- THEY\u2019RE ALWAYS 20% TO 60% OFF FRONTLINE. IF THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE IT, THAT\u2019S ALL GRAVY. BUT THE MODEL IS PREDICATED ON HOLDING THAT PRICE AND GETTING THE COMP AND MARGIN WHILE HOLDING PRICE. EVERYTHING THAT THEY WOULD RAISE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND UPSIDE TO THE CURRENT GUIDANCE. SCARLET: PRETTY INCREDIBLE STORY THERE. T.J.X. TRADING AT RECORD HIGH. THANK YOU, ADRIENNE YIH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DEALS AND WE DID GET ONE FROM LOWE\u2019S. THE COMPANY AGREED TO BUY FOUNDATION BUILDING MATERIALS FOR $8.8 BILLION IN CASH, ACCELERATING THE HOME IMPROVEMENT SUPPLIER\u2019S PUSH TO SERVE MORE PROFESSIONAL CONSUMERS. HERE WITH THAT STORY IS LILY MEYER. I JOKE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN HOME DEPOT\u2019S PLAYBOOK. > > EXACTLY. BOTH HOME GOODS COMPANIES HAVE LEANED INTO THEIR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, SO THEY\u2019RE CATERING TO CONTRACTORS AND TO PEOPLE WHO WORK IN CONSTRUCTION, WHO OFTEN SHOP MORE AND BUY MORE. SCARLET: THIS HAS WORKED OUT REALLY WELL FOR HOME DEPOT AT THE EXPENSE OF LOWE\u2019S. NOW THAT LOWE\u2019S HAS WADESSED INTO THE SPACE, WHAT ARE ANALYSTS SAYING ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS GOING FORWARD? > > THE MARKET REACTED WELL TO THE DEAL AND TO LOWE\u2019S EARNINGS THIS MORNING. BOTH OF THE COMPANIES HAVE STRUGGLED IN RECENT YEARS. PEOPLE ARE MOVING LESS. RATES ARE HIGH. BUT THEY\u2019RE LOOKING TO THIS AREA TO TRY AND REGAIN SOME TRACTION IN GROWTH SALES. IT MIGHT BE WORKING. SCARLET: IN TERMS OF LOWE\u2019S\u2019 RESULTS OVERALL WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE SPENDING AND WHETHER THE COMPANY IS UNDER PRESSURE TO PASS ALONG INCREASED COSTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS BECAUSE HOME DEPOT HAD MADE CLEAR PEOPLE ARE STILL SPENDING BUT JUST ON SMALLER PROJECTS. > > LOWE\u2019S SAID THEY\u2019RE SEEING A MIX. THEY DIDN\u2019T GIVE A TON OF SPECIFICS ON SMALL VERSUS LARGE. TO MY UNDERSTANDING. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE. SCARLET: ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT. PERHAPS THE BIG PROJECTS WILL NOW COME FORTH BECAUSE OF THIS NEW PURCHASE. LILY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. COMING UP ON \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS,\" CITIGROUP IS SAID TO HIRE A LAW FIRM TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE WEALTH MANAGEMENT CHIEF. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a SCARLET: THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" I AM SCARLET FU. CITIGROUP LAWYERED UP, HIRING A LAWYER TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE WEALTH MANAGEMENT CHIEF, WHO WAS MEANT TO DRIVE A KEY PART OF THE TURN AROUND PLAN. HERE WITH MORE IS TODD GILLESPIE WHO BROKE THE NEWS. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SCOOP. HOW IS CITIGROUP RESPONDING TO YOUR REPORTING? > > THEY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION BUT THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS WOULD BE STANDARD PRACTICE TO AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHEN THERE ARE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE RAISED AGAINST SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THEY ALSO APPEAR TO STAND BY HIM. THEY MADE THE POINT THAT HE HAS INCREASED REVENUE AND RETURNS OF THE BUSINESS AND HE IS DOING ON PAPER IN TERMS OF RESULTS WHICH IS WHAT SHAREHOLDERS WANT A DECENT JOB. BEAR IN MIND, THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN HIS JOB FOR LESS THAN TWO YEARS. TO ATTRACT THIS AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS AND SENIOR WOMEN WHO HAVE LEFT UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, IT HAS RAISED CONCERNS AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE FIRM. WE MENTIONED IN OUR STORY FOR INSTANCE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EXPLETIVE-FILLED RANTS, REDUCING MALE MANAGING DIRECTORS TO TEARS, USING THE WORD PATHETIC TO DESCRIBE A PERSON\u2019S CONTRIBUTION IN A MEETING IN FRONT OF THAT PERSON AND THEIR COLLEAGUES AS WELL. SO THIS GOES BEYOND LIKE NORMAL WALL STREET ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE AND HAS RAISED FLAGS THAT GO BEYOND THAT. SCARLET: SOME SENIOR LEADERS WHO FELT THE BRUNT OF HIS WRATH. WE SHOWED THEIR RESPONSE. THEY SEEM TO BE STANDING BY HIM. HAS HE BEEN PUT ON LEAVE? IS HE STILL RUNNING WEALTHS MANAGEMENTS? > > HE IS VERY MUCH RUNNING WEALTH MANAGEMENT. ONE PERSON WHO IS NO LONGER IN THE WEALTH BUSINESS IS IDA LOU, SHE SUDDENLY LEFT IN JANUARY THIS YEAR AFTER 18 YEARS AS CITIGROUP, ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FIGURES AT THE BANK. SHE DID LEAVE SUDDENLY. WE KNOW NOW IN OUR REPORTING THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE COMPLAINTS WERE FOCUSED ON HIS TREATMENT OF HER. FOR INSTANCE, HIS C.O.O. DIRECTED ANOTHER MANAGING DIRECTOR TO EXCLUDE HER FROM CORRESPONDENCE THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HER BUSINESS. WE KNOW HE MOCKED AND DISPARAGED HER, USED SARCASTIC COMMENTS TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT HE -- ANOTHER TARGET OF THIS BEHAVIOR WAS ONE OF HIS CURRENT DEPUTIES STILL AT THE FIRM. SHE RUNS ONE OF THE THREE CORE BUSINESSES DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH ANDY SIEG AND SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS WERE ABOUT HIS TREATMENT OF HER. SCARLET: WE KNOW JANE FRAZIER HAD REALLY TRIED TO RECRUIT HIM AND HAD OFFERED HAIM LOT TO MOVE OVER -- HIM A LOT TO MOVE OVER TO CITI. IS HE IN CONTENTION TO BE ONE OF THE SENIORS -- SENIOR LEADERS OF THE FIRM? > > HE CAME AFTER SIX YEARS OF RUNNING MERRILL AT BANK OF AMERICA, AN INVESTMENTS GUY, THAT SORT OF HIT HIS BREAD AND BUTTER. HE ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAVE REALLY BEEN PART OF JANE\u2019S PUSH TO REVAMP THE BANK. HE IS STILL ONE OF THE FIVE -- ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUNS EACH OF THE FIVE CORE BUSINESSES AT HER BANK. HE SITS ON THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM. HE HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR INSTANCE IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS A POTENTIAL C.E.O. CONTENDER. SCARLET: ALL RIGHT. SO FAR THAT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE STILL. TODD, REALLY FANTASTIC REPORTING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING IT WITH -- SHARING IT WITH US. I AM SCARLET FU. THAT DOES IT FOR \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" \"BALANCE OF POWER\" IS UP NEXT. \u266a",

  "argos_summary": "Bloomberg Markets reports a modest decline in the S&P 500 amid pressure on Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who faces a resignation demand from President Trump over alleged mortgage fraud. Trump also disclosed significant corporate bond purchases, while the show highlighted Alaska Air\u2019s new loyalty program and a range of equity movers, including a sell\u2011off in tech stocks and gains in discount retailers like T.J. X. Analysts note that market volatility is largely driven by positioning rather than fundamentals, and that upcoming Fed events and corporate deals\u2014such as Lowe\u2019s acquisition of Foundation Building Materials\u2014could shape short\u2011term sentiment. Additionally, Citigroup is hiring a law firm to investigate complaints against its wealth\u2011management chief, reflecting ongoing internal governance concerns. Overall, the segment underscores the intersection of political pressure, monetary policy uncertainty, and corporate activity in shaping market dynamics.",
