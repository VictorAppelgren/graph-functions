Diehard B&S fans that can\u2019t wait to hear \u201cElectronic Renaissance\u201d and \u201cLike Dylan in the Movies\u201d live can snag two-day passes here.\n\nAs for what the \u201cclassic tracks\u201d are that will accompany the cult favorite albums on nights one and two, we don\u2019t have any insider information but would guess \u201cThe Boy With The Arab Strap,\u201d \u201cAnother Sunny Day,\u201d \u201cLazy Line Painter Jane\u201d and \u201cEvery Day\u2019s A Lesson in Humility\u201d make the cut based on past set lists.\n\nAnd, no promises but our fingers are crossed they rock \u201cPiazza, New York Catcher\u201d in the Big Apple.\n\n\u201cThe high-energy set saw the band in good form, with frontman Stuart Murdoch bouncing (sometimes literally) between keyboard, guitar, and tambourine,\u201d Concert Addicts wrote in a glowing review of a May 2024 concert. \u201cOverall, it was a fun show which served as a reminder of why the band has had so much longevity.\u201d\n\nThe Herbaceous Border can purchase tickets for all upcoming North American Belle and Sebastian shows on sites like Vivid Seats; the official on-sale for the 30th Anniversary Tour is Friday, Aug. 22.\n\nVivid Seats is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey have a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and will be delivered before the event.\n\nA complete calendar including all tour dates, venues and links to buy tickets can be found here:\n\nRather than make you shlep to Spotify, we\u2019ve got all the songs that make up \u201cTigermilk\u201d for you here:\n\nHere\u2019s a refresher in the off-chance you\u2019ve forgotten what makes up \u201cIf You\u2019re Feeling Sinister\u201d:\n\n06.) \u201cGet Me Away From Here, I\u2019m Dying\u201d\n\n10.) \u201cJudy and the Dream of Horses\u201d\n\nFans of Stuart Murdoch know his history as an overachieving go-getter who ended up saddled with chronic fatigue in the early \u201990s, before the disease had become well-known.\n\nUsing that as a jumping-off point, the hyper-literate Scotsman wrote \u201cNobody\u2019s Empire,\u201d which tells the story of Stephen with \u201cgraceful notes, melancholic chords, and witty, thoughtful riffs on life\u2019s infinite possibilities and curiosities,\u201d according to Amazon.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read the book that the Minnesota Star Tribune claims \u201cdazzles with indie charm,\u201d click here.\n\nIn 2014, Murdoch released his debut film, the romantic musical drama \u201cGod Help The Girl\u201d starring Emily Browning and Olly Alexander.\n\n\u201cOne of my top indie gems of the year, charming, enchanting, fun and fancy-free, \u2018God Help The Girl\u2019 is a divine intervention,\u201d Behind The Lens raved about the stylish coming-of-age feature.\n\nNever seen the flick?\n\nNo worries. \u201cGod Help The Girl\u201d is streaming on Tubi for free.\n\nCan\u2019t wait until 2026 to see Stuart live?\n\nHold onto your hats, fellow hipsters.

      "text": "Midway through his Friday, Sept. 1 concert at East Rutherford, NJ\u2019s MetLife Stadium, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Bruce Springsteen took a minute to allude to one of the few unfortunate breaks in his illustrious career.\nThe music quieted and The Boss told a humorous story of how he was kicked out of his first band, The Rogues, way back in 1965.\nHe laughed it off with \u201cSopranos\u201d cast member and longtime E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt but clearly this chip on his shoulder had a lasting impact.\n58 years later, no one in music continually works harder to prove their worth. Rather than phone it in, Springsteen gives it his all to show his loyal fanbase \u2014 and maybe The Rogues \u2014 that he belongs every single time he takes the stage.\nLet\u2019s go back to the beginning though.\nStarting promptly at 7:55 p.m. as New Jerseyans straggled into the massive Jets and Giants stadium with their $50 \u201cBorn In The U.S.A.\u201d souvenir t-shirts, Springsteen and the E Street Band kicked the evening off with the rockin\u2019, larger-than-life \u201cLonesome Day.\u201d\nThen, for nearly 2.5 hours, the long-running ensemble took nary a break. No banter, all bangers. Each song bled into the next with Bruce\u2019s signature \u201c1, 2, 3, 4!\u201d cry giving the crowd a full-on musical thrill ride that never ran out of gas and was simultaneously heavy, silly and soaring sometimes all within the span of one song.\nOf course, the singalong hits were just as impassioned, fresh and joyously infectious as when they debuted nearly a half century ago \u2014 \u201cBorn To Run,\u201d \u201cThunder Road\u201d and \u201cDancing In The Dark\u201d all made this reviewer\u2019s hair stand on end \u2014 but they weren\u2019t even close to the chill-inducing pair of highlights from the jam-packed evening.\nEarly in the night, the band surprised super fans with the inclusion of their bluesy 1973 classic \u201cSpirit In The Night\u201d which The Boss hasn\u2019t busted out since 2017 according to Set List FM. While the song didn\u2019t have the seamless flow it does on the record, hearing the slowed-down, twinkling piano section live under Bruce\u2019s powerful, gruff vocals was truly a great gift.\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the peak.\nFor this reviewer, it was the rousing cover of The Commodores\u2019 hit \u201cNight Shift\u201d where Springsteen stepped aside and showcased the horn section, drummer Max Weinberg (who you may remember from \u201cLate Night with Conan O\u2019Brien\u201d) and most importantly, backup singer Curtis King Jr.\u2019s striking falsetto that left the night\u2019s most lasting impression.\nThat\u2019s not to mention Bruce\u2019s true co-MVP, saxophonist Jake Clemons (the nephew of the late Clarence Clemons), who blew his heart out all night breathing shockingly urgent life into the music that the band has been playing live for six (!) decades now.\nSimply put, you have to see The Boss and his talented band live to truly appreciate their craft.\nAt the center of it all, the 74-year-old Springsteen is a pure showman full of gusto and bravado incorporating every tool at his disposal. Whispers, echoes, street preacher sermons, false starts and stops, ripping his shirt open, sharing a mic dangerously close to Van Zandt, spoken word sections, yelps and heart. Lots and lots and lots of heart.\nThe man still really cares about the music.\nBased on what we saw, no one\u2019s kicking him out of The E Street Band anytime soon.\nFinal verdict: Although Bruce didn\u2019t play \u201cJungleland,\u201d \u201cBorn In The U.S.A.,\u201d \u201cHungry Heart\u201d and countless other favorites at the gig this reviewer attended, we\u2019ll give him a pass \u2014 the Sept. 1 concert was a complete, satisfying experience that encapsulated Springsteen\u2019s historic career beautifully.\nIf you haven\u2019t caught The Boss live, make it a priority.\nNew Yorkers, he\u2019s in Syracuse next at the JMA Wireless Dome on Thursday, Sept. 7.\nAfter that, The Boss will drop into Albany\u2019s MVP Arena on Tuesday, Sept. 19.\nBruce Springsteen 2023-24 tour schedule\nA complete calendar of all 24 remaining summer, fall and winter concert dates, venues and links to buy tickets can be found below.\nBruce Springsteen set list\nHere\u2019s what we heard Asbury Park\u2019s most famous band play at the Sept. 1 MetLife Stadium show courtesy of Set List FM.\n01.) \u201cLonesome Day\u201d\n02.) \u201cNight\u201d\n03.) \u201cNo Surrender\u201d\n04.) \u201cGhosts\u201d\n05.) \u201cProve It All Night\u201d\n06.) \u201cDarkness On The Edge Of Town\u201d\n07.) \u201cLetter To You\u201d\n08.) \u201cThe Promised Land\u201d\n09.) \u201cSpirit In The Night\u201d\n10.) \u201cKitty\u2019s Back\u201d\n11.) \u201cNightshift\u201d (Commodores cover)\n12.) \u201cThe E Street Shuffle\u201d\n13.) \u201cMary\u2019s Place\u201d\n14.) \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d\n15.) \u201cBackstreets\u201d\n16.) \u201cBecause The Night\u201d (Patti Smith cover)\n17.) \u201cShe\u2019s The One\u201d\n18.) \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d\n19.) \u201cThe Rising\u201d\n20.) \u201cBadlands\u201d\n21.) \u201cThunder Road\u201d\nEncore\n22.) \u201cBorn To Run\u201d\n23.) \u201cRosalita (Come Out Tonight)\u201d\n24.) \u201cSeven Nights To Rock\u201d (Moon Mullican cover)\n24.) \u201cGlory Days\u201d\n25.) \u201cDancing In The Dark\u201d\n26.) \u201cTenth Avenue Freeze Out\u201d\nEncore Two\n27.) \u201cI\u2019ll See You In My Dreams\u201d\nClassic rockers on tour in 2023\nA surprising number of stars that dominated the charts in the \u201970s and \u201980s are back on the road this year.\nHere are our five favorite acts you won\u2019t want to miss these next few months.\n\u2022 Billy Joel with Stevie Nicks\n\u2022 Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band\nWant to see who else is out and about?

      "text": "By: debbie lynn elias\nWith a beguiling adorable awkwardness, first time screenwriter/director Stuart Murdoch puts a song in your heart and a spring in your step with the oh-so-lovely, GOD HELP THE GIRL. Lead singer-songwriter of the Scottish pop/rock group Belle & Sebastian, Murdoch makes the jump to film with a musical that is truly a musical, with songs and their lyrics built into the story and dialogue, harkening to Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age or even the Peter Webb directed Paul McCartney vehicle, \u201cGive My Regards to Broad Street\u201d or The Beatles \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d. Tapping into the ideal of music as the common denominator of the world, with the opening scene and eye-catching number, \u201cAct of the Apostle\u201d, Murdoch strikes an easy chord thanks to not only his easy-breezy yet thematically telling pop tunes (which you will be humming as you leave the theatre) but with a youthful exuberant cast who act, sing, dance and yes, do all their own vocals.\nSet in a quiet, cobblestoned, pastoral suburb of Glasgow, we meet Eve as she is sneaking out late at night of what we presume to be a boarding school, heading off to see bands at a local club. Appearing to be \u201copen mic night\u201d, the crowd rocks out to Wobbly Legged Rats and their sexy frontman and lead singer, Anton (who seems to have eyes for Eve), before being less than wowed by newcomer singer-guitarist James who appears bandless but for the house drummer loudly banging in the background, prompting an all-out barroom brawl. One look at Eve and you know that there\u2019s something about James and his music that speaks to her.\nOn her returning \u201chome\u201d, we realize that Eve is not in a boarding school, but in a residential treatment facility/psychiatric hospital for a severe eating disorder. Through conversations with her psychiatrist, we learn just enough to know Eve has had a tough life, a life that pushed her into depression and this disorder. Unable to cope, Eve\u2019s one outlet is songwriting and music. Pouring her feelings into lyrics is emotionally freeing. But she wants more. She wants to perform.\nStifled and wanting out of the facility, Eve moves into a room in James\u2019 apartment, allowing her to partner up with him to write songs. Although Eve believes she needs James\u2019 help, James is convinced that Eve has a God-given talent and he\u2019s just there to provide musical support. Joining in the mix is Cassie. A girl from the \u201cright side of the tracks\u201d, Cassie has been a music student of James\u2019 for some time, but to little avail. She wants more than practicing methodical scales over and over and over. She wants to write and sing and perform; and inspired by Eve, that\u2019s exactly what she starts to do. And so, on one bright summer day, a music group is formed.\nBut as with most groups comes trials and tribulations as James is falling for and pines away for Eve who is oblivious to his intentions as she is smitten with Anton who has promised to get her demo CD to some local radio DJ\u2019s. And Cassie, well, while a bit flighty, is up for anything James and Eve want to do.\nAs worlds and wants start colliding and long buried truths emerge, not to mention Eve running out of a much needed medication to keep her on an emotionally even keel, can the trio hold things together or will they fall apart just as their career starts to take flight?\nEmily Browning is luminous as Eve. Walking the fine line between fragility and calculating tough as nails persona, Browning soars with a sincerity and beauty that is at times enchantingly Audrey Hepburn kittenish and others, Bette Davis cold and enraged. Browning knows how to use the camera with her eyes and it doesn\u2019t take much before you find yourself hypnotized by her, drawn ever deeper into Eve\u2019s world. It\u2019s a delicate dance that is only enhanced by an amazing strong and versatile voice that evokes wistful emotion, defiance, pain and joy with every note. Browning\u2019s lyricism serves as it\u2019s own layer of storytelling. Notable in her performance is the intricacy of some of her choreography which at times requires perfecting a clipped rigidity. Browning nails the movements.\nI first took note of Olly Alexander some years back in \u201cBright Star\u201d. He has an understated quality that many audiences are just now discovering thanks to his work in \u201cPenny Dreadful.\u201d Here, as the nerdy James, Alexander laces the character with a touch of musically superior arrogance that gives James a duality that is both confident and not. It\u2019s an interesting approach that is compelling, serving as a connective thread that balances the contrasting personas of Browning\u2019s Eve and Hannah Murray\u2019s Cassie. And again, his musical talents are not wasted here.\nHannah Murray delights as Cassie. Free-spirited yet needing to break free of the rigidity of her family\u2019s wealth and prominence, Murray adds a touch of ditziness to Cassie that is warm and welcoming \u2013 and charmingly funny. She finds strong footing with a \u201ccoming of age\u201d and \u201cfinding of self\u201d tone that buoys the dynamic of the three principals.\nWhen it comes to bad boy Anton, Pierre Boulanger fills the bill nicely from his leather looks to a two-faced personality evident to all but Eve.\nThe real joy of GOD HELP THE GIRL is the music and the story construct as it incorporates the specific songs and lyrics into the plot. This is not a case of songs just being \u201cdropped in\u201d for amusement. Each is staged as part of the script and are poignant, speaking to specific thematic and tonal elements of the moment, yet never feeling heavy or maudlin. Murdoch keeps the songs and the tone of the film, light and upbeat. Adding to the engaging feel of the film as a whole is Emily-Jane Boyle\u2019s dance choreography that accompanies each song, providing a Gene Kelly-Stanley Donen touch that is highly stylized and accentuated in movement and tone. Particularly joyous in song, performance and tone is a large multi-generational set-piece in a seniors\u2019 hall to \u201cDance With Cassie\u201d.\nInteresting is Murdoch\u2019s journey in making GOD HELP THE GIRL and the fact that it started back in 2003 with the music and specific song lyrics. Seeing and sensing a complete story emerging from the song, Murdoch knew it wasn\u2019t a fit for Belle & Sebastian. That\u2019s when the idea of a feature film started to take shape. It wasn\u2019t until 2006, however, that Murdoch sat down to not only write the screenplay for GOD HELP THE GIRL but to seek out singers and musicians for a new band to record the songs he was writing within the film\u2019s construct. Although an album of the tracks was released in 2009 complete with some key music videos which then aided Murdoch with his visual design of the film and became the core of GOD HELP THE GIRL, when casting the film, Murdoch was intent on casting actors who could not only act but do their own singing, which is what you see and hear in the film to excellent result. (And yes, the soundtrack is a must for your personal playlist as are the original recordings off the 2009 album.)\nSomewhat light in backstory and plot details, the structure serves GOD HELP THE GIRL well as it puts everything and everyone \u201cin the moment\u201d for a French New Wave feeling. Set within the confines of one summer, friendships are made and tested, the fear and wonder of self-discovery pulsates with the beat of the music and the ordinary becomes sun-kissed extraordinary. Underscoring the \u201cin the moment\u201d sensibility is the tacit messaging about life and that no matter how mundane or boring or stuck one may be, every life warrants the joy and fun of music and a musical. Adding to this is some beautiful cinematography by Giles Nuttgens. A cinematographer with mad skills, it\u2019s easy to look at some of his key prior films \u2013 \u201cDom Hemingway\u201d, \u201cWhat Maisie Knew\u201d and \u201cLoss of a Teardrop Diamond\u201d \u2013 to see why he is the perfect man for GOD HELP THE GIRL.\nShooting on 16mm film, Nuttgens and Murdoch create a timelessness that is not only beautiful to look at thanks to saturation of color and the way 16mm captures light and color, but provides an ambient tone that engages with each shot looking as much a \u201cmoney shot\u201d as the next. Cinematic with a bit of whimsy, the result is wonderfully executed emotional metaphor with juxtapositioned contrasts. Gorgeous locations throughout Glasgow and its West End just add to the overall experience \u2013 Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow\u2019s Central Station, the Botanic Gardens (a stunner to be sure), the Victorian era Western Baths Club \u2013 and make a wonderful mini-travelogue for Glasgow!\nEditor David Arthur finds an even beat not only with the overall pace of the film, but particularly with the cutting of the musical numbers. Done with an edge and often utilizing jump cuts to their best advantage, Arthur\u2019s music video background and prior work with Murdoch and his music serves the film. Appreciative is the care by Murdoch and Arthur in the placement of musical numbers within the context of the story and visuals, scattering them from beginning to end allowing the ebb and flow of the story and characters with the music elevating emotional levels.\nIcing on the cake with GOD HELP THE GIRL is the production of Mark Leese and Denise Coombs\u2019 costume design. Where production design has a bohemian shabby chic sensibility contrasted against the stoic timeless strength of some of the locations, fashion blends nods to 60\u2019s pop, Twiggy and the British invasion with a 50\u2019s vibe and even post-WWII London. Costuming \u2013 especially for Emily Browning\u2019s Eve \u2013 leaps off the screen, begging to be seen on pages in Vogue. Eclectic blends of color, flower power, various textures and fabrications, schoolgirl innocence styling, all enhance the freeform adventurous styling of the film as a whole.\nOne of my top indie gems of the year, charming, enchanting, fun and fancy-free, GOD HELP THE GIRL is a divine intervention.\nWritten and Directed by Stuart Murdoch\nCast: Emily Browning, Olly Alexander, Hannah Murray, Pierre Boulanger"

      "text": "Backstreet\u2019s back to manageable ticket prices, alright.\nAfter hovering over $570 per seat for Backstreet Boys\u2018 last three August \u2018Into The Millennium\u2019 Las Vegas Sphere residency concerts earlier this week \u2014 as reported by The Post here \u2014 ticket prices have dropped precipitously.\nAt the time of publication, our team found some seats for their Aug. 22-24 concerts going for as low as $401.75 including fees on Vivid Seats.\nTheir two other shows have tickets starting at $407 and $434 including fees.\nWhile still pricey, that\u2019s over $170 in savings. Not bad for a time when inflation runs rampant and hikes up costs in nearly every sector of American life.\nAlso, if you haven\u2019t heard about the \u2018Into The Millennium\u2019 residency, it shouldn\u2019t be understated how groundbreaking Nick, AJ, Kevin, Brian and Howie\u2019s live Sphere show is.\nIn addition to dishing out the \u201cMillennium\u201d album in full and timeless hits like \u201cEverybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back),\u201d \u201cThe Call\u201d and \u201cQuit Playing Games (With My Heart),\u201d the vocally-gifted Grammy nominees deliver a showstopping spectacle that must be seen live to be believed.\n\u201cThe visuals, all carefully married to the music, take fans on a surreal ride: from blast-off into deep space, to asteroid-surfing and dancing on alien worlds populated by giant, holographic Backstreet avatars,\u201d Live For Live Music raved in a review of the live show. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Interstellar,\u2019 \u2018Tron,\u2019 and \u2018TRL\u2019 had a glitter-soaked lovechild.\u201d\nCan\u2019t make it to the one-of-a-kind concert this weekend?\nNo worries.\nDue to overwhelming BSB Army demand, the residency has been extended into 2026. As of now, the \u201990s icons have 14 more shows lined up from December through February including a New Year\u2019s Eve gig as well as a Friday the 13th show and Valentine\u2019s Day concert.\nFor more information, our team has everything you need to know and more about Backstreet Boys\u2019 2025-26 Las Vegas Sphere residency below.\nAll prices listed above are subject to fluctuation.\nBackstreet Boys Las Vegas Sphere ticket prices\nA complete calendar including remaining \u2018Into The Millennium\u2019 Sphere dates, show start times and links to the what tickets cost versus what they were going for on Aug. 18 can be found here:\n| Backstreet Boys Sphere dates | Ticket prices start at | Ticket prices started at on Aug. 18 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Friday, Aug. 22 8 p.m. | $401.75 (including fees) | $622.15 (including fees) |\n| Saturday, Aug. 23 8 p.m. | $434.02 (including fees) | $626.94 (including fees) |\n| Sunday, Aug. 24 8 p.m. | $407.22 (including fees) | $572 (including fees) |\n(Note: The New York Post confirmed all above prices at the publication time.

Melissas,\u201d Villase\u00f1or said over Zoom. \u201cI had a really good time the whole week we filmed.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not all.\nVillase\u00f1or is also embarking on her nationwide \u2018New Things Tour\u2019 gearing herself up for her eventual special \u201cMore Melissa\u201d \u2014 named after what commenters would write online after watching \u2018SNL\u2019 \u2014 and a possible sitcom she\u2019s developing.\nWhat can fans expect if they see Villase\u00f1or live this year?\n\u201cMy stand up is about myself,\u201d she shared. \u201cThere\u2019s impressions, but it\u2019s not famous people. It\u2019s people around me, my family, so there\u2019s always a lot of voices.\u201d\nTo be fair, there are a few celebrities in the act.\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing back J-Lo. Ash Ketchum from Pok\u00e9mon and Pikachu and Schwarzenegger. They\u2019re all very silly, but tied of my life in some way,\u201d she said.\nMore than anything, the material really is more Melissa \u2014 more personal, more honest, more of a showcase of her skills set.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more my story, more my point of view, more voices, more singing. It\u2019s everything. There are no rules.\u201d\nPlus, she may even surprise you at a show.\n\u201cMy journey has been positive but I have a lot of new bits that are on the darker, meaner side that I don\u2019t usually get to reveal.\u201d\nShe won\u2019t get too crazy though.\n\u201c(The jokes) aren\u2019t even that mean but I think the crowd really loves it because they\u2019re like, \u2018Whoa, we didn\u2019t expect that.'\u201d\nWant to see more Melissa than ever before?\nKeep reading.\nWe\u2019ve got everything you need to know and more below.\nMelissa Villase\u00f1or 2023 tour schedule\nA complete calendar including all of Villase\u00f1or\u2019s tour dates, venues and links to buy tickets can be found below.\nMelissa\u2019s time at \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\nAs major SNL nerds, we couldn\u2019t help but ask Melissa a few questions about her six seasons on the show.\nHere\u2019s what she had to say.\nNew York Post: Are there any sketches that got cut at dress you\u2019re especially bummed the world never got to see?\nMelissa: My impression of Sebastian Maniscalco. I did him twice at dress rehearsal. There was one where I was him on a \u2018Family Feud,\u2019 and it did really well but sometimes it doesn\u2019t work out. Maybe the host doesn\u2019t like their piece or you don\u2019t know the reason.\nThere are also a few comedy songs I wrote for SNL that didn\u2019t get picked for music videos so I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to make those happen for the live show because they\u2019re so fun.\nNYP: Did you ever do another installment of your dirty talk character you did with Aziz Ansari and Donald Glover?\nMelissa: Sort of. There was a table read with Oscar Isaac because he really liked that one but it didn\u2019t pan out.\nThose sketches were written by Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell. They always joked \u201cMelissa can\u2019t talk dirty.\u201d\nNYP: What do you think of this season thus far?\nMelissa: I think it\u2019s great. It makes me happy to see everyone get more screen time too. They\u2019re really spreading their wings with their ideas now.\nNYP: Which writers did you appreciate most in your time there?\nMelissa: I really enjoyed working with my friend Steven Castillo. We wrote for a few years together on things like the Nickelback sketch from a few years back. I liked working with Andrew Dismukes and Ben Silva the last season too.\nSilva helped me write my Cesar character and the Peek at Pico \u201cthat\u2019s so sad\u201d sketch.\nNYP: What do you see after the 50th season happening now?\nI have no clue. It\u2019s a mystery. It\u2019s a mystery, yeah.\nEven if I was there, it\u2019d be a mystery. No one knows anything, really.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nSNL stars on tour in 2023\nMelissa isn\u2019t the only cast member out and about this year.\nHere are just five fellow Not Ready For Primetime Players that you can catch at a venue near you these next few months.\nWho else is on the road from \u201cSNL?\u201d Check out our list of all 31 \u201cSNL\u201d alumni on tour in 2023 here."
