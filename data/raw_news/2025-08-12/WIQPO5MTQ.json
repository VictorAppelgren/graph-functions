  "description": "CINCINNATI, August 12, 2025--Healthwarehouse reports 182% Growth in Sales and $228,000 in Net Income for the Second Quarter of 2025",
  "content": "Reports 182% Growth in Sales and $228,000 in Net Income for the Quarter CINCINNATI, August 12, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HealthWarehouse.com, Inc. (OTCQB:HEWA) announced today that its net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, totaled $15.7 million, a 182% increase from the quarter ended June 30, 2024, resulting from 495% growth in partner services revenues. The Company reported net income of $228,000 and Adjusted EBITDA of $568,000 for the quarter. HealthWarehouse.com, a technology company with a focus on healthcare e-commerce, sells and delivers prescription and over-the-counter medications to all 50 states as an Approved Digital Pharmacy through the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). HealthWarehouse.com provides a platform focused on increasing access to and reducing costs of healthcare products for consumers and business partners nationwide. Joseph Peters, President and CEO, commented, \"Our team carried the momentum from the past nine months of rapid growth into the second quarter of 2025, resulting in continued positive financials, proving the economic scalability of our business model. We have established ourselves as a reliable service provider for high volume partners and we have shown our expertise in processing orders that require cold-chain shipping services.\" HealthWarehouse.com continues to invest in proprietary technology to remain at the forefront of new developments and offerings in the world of healthcare, focusing on patient experience, operational efficiency, and scalability. Peters noted that the FDA has announced the end of the shortage of certain GLP1 drugs, including tirzepatide and semaglutide. That will impact pharmacies and telehealth providers like Healthwarehouse.com which have been offering compounded versions of those drugs while the principal manufacturers were unable to meet demand. Healthwarehouse.com expects to see an impact from the FDA ruling on its results for the second half of the year, starting with the third quarter. \"Fortunately, as the pharmacy world starts to focus on offerings outside of the GLP1 space, we have a robust pipeline of partner-service business, with many diversified product categories,\" Peters added. \"Additionally, we are well equipped to help manufacturers launch direct-to-patient programs and are eager to develop new opportunities in that market. I am grateful for our team, as they continue to solve new problems and provide world class service to our customers.\" Overview of Results for Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 Net Sales: Total net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, were $15.7 million and $30.7 million, respectively, increasing by $9.9 million (171.8%) and $19.8 million (182.0%), respectively, versus the same periods in 2024.\n\nPrescription sales were $15.0 million and $29.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, respectively, an increase of $10.0 million (196.5%) and $19.9 million (210.5%), respectively, compared with the same periods in 2024. The increase in prescription sales was due to growth in partner services revenue, offset by $908,000 and $1.6 million declines in the direct-to-consumer prescription business for the three- and six-months periods. Sales of over-the-counter products were $599,000 and $1.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, respectively, a decrease of $44,000 (6.8%) and $122,000 (9.6%), respectively, over the same periods in 2024, primarily due to a decline in Partner Services over-the-counter sales. Gross Profit: Gross profit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, was $5.2 million and $9.7 million, respectively, representing increases of $2.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2024. The increases were the result of higher sales offset by lower margins on our partner services prescription business. Gross margin percentages were 32.9% and 31.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, respectively, which were 18.4 and 22.7 percentage points lower, respectively, versus prior-year periods. The reduction was primarily due to lower margins in the Partner Services prescription businesses. Operating Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.8 million and $9.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, respectively, which were increases of $1.6 million (49.9%) and $2.8 million (43.3%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2024. Expense increases included increases in shipping and shipping supplies, salaries primarily related to higher direct pharmacy labor, software engineering and business development, and advertising and legal expenses. Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA: The Company reported net income of $228,000 and $406,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, respectively, compared with net losses of $344,000 and $596,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2024. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as adjusted for stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring charges (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), were $609,000 for the three months and $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. That compares with Adjusted EBITDA of $25,000 and $140,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these non-GAAP terms and a reconciliation to GAAP measures are provided below. For the Three Months Ended Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures HealthWarehouse.com, Inc. (the \"Company\") prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are commonly used. In addition to adjusting net income or net loss to exclude interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of right of use lease asset, (\"EBITDA\"), Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation, and certain nonrecurring charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, Adjusted EBITDA is used internally in planning and evaluating the Company`s performance. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of this metric offers lenders and other shareholders an additional view of the Company`s operations that, when coupled with GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company\u2019s financial results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net loss or to net cash provided by or used in operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the Company`s performance. HealthWarehouse.com, Inc. (OTCQB: HEWA), a technology company with a focus on healthcare e-commerce, sells and delivers prescription and over-the-counter medications to all 50 states as an Approved Digital Pharmacy through the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (\"NABP\").
