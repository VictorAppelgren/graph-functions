  "title": "How long is Shedeur Sanders out? Injury timeline for Browns QB",
  "description": "Shedeur Sanders is battling an oblique injury. Here's how long the Browns may be without their rookie quarterback.",
  "content": "Shedeur Sanders' roller coaster doesn't appear to be pulling into the station anytime soon.\n\nIt began with a positive outlook in the 2025 NFL Draft, continued with a stunning fall to the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round, and then transitioned to some positive community work. It was that same community where Sanders ran into trouble with a pair of speeding tickets and then turned some heads with his solid performance in Week 1 of the NFL preseason.\n\nFootball fans, the Browns and Sanders were all looking forward to an encore performance in Week 2 of the preseason \u2013 which came with yet another bump in the road.\n\nSanders suffered an oblique injury during joint practices with the Philadelphia Eagles on Wednesday, Aug. 13. That now threatens the quarterback's availability for the remainder of the preseason, meaning it's a mystery when we'll see Sanders on the field in game action again.\n\nHere's what to know about Sanders' injury and how long he might be out.\n\nHow long is Shedeur Sanders out?\n\nSanders is day-to-day with an oblique injury.\n\n\u201cYeah, felt it early, I think warming up and then felt it throughout individual (drills), so took a look at it,\u201d Stefanski told reporters on Thursday. \u201cIf it\u2019s a right guard, you can play through that. When it\u2019s a quarterback, you kind of need that muscle to throw.\"\n\nStefanski added that they'll see how Sanders responds to treatment, adding that they don't want to push it with him.\n\n\"So unfortunately we're going to put him down for a little bit here,\" Stefanski said. \"We will treat it day to day and see how he responds. But we want to be smart. He's a thrower so you can't push that thing.\"\n\nWhile losing the practice and game reps doesn't help Sanders' case in the team's quarterback competition, the head coach did note that there are other ways to prepare and improve off the field as well.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just with throwers, and pitchers, and guys that torque and twist their body, you\u2019ve got to be really careful,\u201d Stefanski said.\n\nBarring something unforeseen, it appears Sanders will be held out of the Browns' second preseason game. It provides an opportunity for fellow rookie, Dillon Gabriel, to have his moment in the spotlight if the former Oregon signal caller can recover from an injury of his own.\n\nThe Browns will wrap up their preseason slate on Saturday, Aug. 23 at home against the Los Angeles Rams.",

      "text": "Shedeur Sanders injury update: Latest news, updates on Browns QB\nThe Cleveland Browns have another quarterback injury to deal with.\nAs Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel are on the mend from hamstring injuries, rookie Shedeur Sanders left practice today with an oblique injury.\nHe was throwing during the early portion of today's joint practice with the Philadelphia Eagles and was held out for the rest of the session.\nSanders was expected to get work vs. the Eagles in the Browns' second preseason game on Saturday, Aug. 16. He started the opening preseason game against the Carolina Panthers in the Browns' 30-10 victory.\nShedeur Sanders injury update\nOn Aug. 14, the day following the revelation of Sanders' injury, head coach Kevin Stefanski said the passer would be \"put down for a little bit\" while he recovers. An exact timeline for Sanders' return is unclear.\n\"If it's a right guard, you can play through that,\" Stefanski said. \"When it's a quarterback, you kind of need that muscle to throw. So unfortunately we're going to put him down for a little bit here. We will treat it day to day and see how he responds. But we want to be smart. He's a thrower so you can't push that thing.\"\nSanders was seen fully dressed at practice, but was not throwing.\nThe Browns originally listed Sanders as day-to-day, a status that hasn't changed.\nSanders suffered an oblique injury during the early stages of the Wednesday, Aug. 12 practice and was held out. He did remain on the sidelines for the remainder of the day.\nBrowns QB depth chart\nThe Browns are a little bit snakebitten when it comes to the quarterback position at the moment. While there's nothing serious affecting the room (outside of Deshaun Watson), Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel are nursing soft-tissue injuries and are making their way back.\nHere's how the room stacks up:\n- Joe Flacco\n- Kenny Pickett\n- Shedeur Sanders/Dillon Gabriel\n- Deshaun Watson (IR)\nThis story will be updated with more information when available."

      "text": "Why did Shedeur Sanders fall in the NFL draft? There's not a simple answer: Opinion\nThere are many layers to why quarterback Shedeur Sanders had a precipitous drop in the 2025 NFL Draft.\nThe quarterback was forecasted by many to go in the first-round after he set Colorado single-season records for passing yards, completions, attempts, touchdowns, completion percentage and quarterback rating last year.\nYet, Sanders didn\u2019t hear his name called until the Cleveland Browns selected him in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, ending a lengthier-than-expected wait.\nEven with the production and the talent, there was still a question after he tumbled down draft boards all the way to Saturday afternoon: Why did Sanders slide to Round 5?\nUSA TODAY Sports spoke to several individuals around the NFL to investigate why Sanders fell to the 144th overall pick in the fifth round of the draft.\nWhy did Shedeur Sanders fall in the draft?\nOverall ability as an NFL quarterback\nDespite Sanders' success at Jackson State and Colorado, many NFL teams didn\u2019t view him as a top quarterback prospect.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good quarterback but doesn\u2019t have traits that jump off the chart,\u201d former NFL All-Pro running back and current NFL Network analyst Maurice Jones-Drew told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not good, but he\u2019s not the fastest and doesn\u2019t have the strongest arm.\u201d\nArm strength and mobility are considered two of Sanders\u2019 main weaknesses when evaluating him as an NFL quarterback prospect. He completed just 47% of his passes beyond 20 yards and 68% of his passes between 10-19 yards at Colorado last season. He also completed 54% of his passes when under pressure last year.\nSanders was sacked 94 times in two seasons at Colorado, the most in FBS during that span.\nInterview process\nThere were several reports leading up to the draft that criticized Sanders' draft interview process. CBS Sports reported that Sanders\u2019 spiral down the draft reflects how he carried himself during the process. The Ringer reported Sanders had a poor interview with the New York Giants, a team that ultimately selected quarterback Jaxson Dart in the first round.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into [that],\u201d Giants general manager Joe Schoen told reporters Friday after reports surfaced about Sanders unfavorable meeting.\nAn anonymous NFL assistant coach told NFL Network his meeting with Sanders was \"the worst formal interview\" he ever had.\n\"Is the juice worth the squeeze? And when the juice has some flaws, the squeeze of managing the personality and dad equal it not being worth it in a lot of instances,\" an NFL agent told USA TODAY Sports. The agent spoke on condition of anonymity because they don't represent Sanders.\nFurthermore, Sanders declined to play at the East-West Shrine Bowl and elected not to participate in drills at the NFL combine. Each event can impact a prospect\u2019s draft status.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s still a job interview when we\u2019re going through the pre-draft process and as clubs are evaluating a potential face of the franchise. It\u2019s important for a QB to look the part and present himself in a certain way,\u201d an NFL agent told USA TODAY Sports. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they don\u2019t represent Sanders.\nSanders' own admission shows he may have second thoughts about how he handled the entirety of the pre-draft process.\n\"I feel like in life, there's always a way I can improve. I'm able to improve. And some things that I [did] that seemed right at the time, I could've went about it a different way,\" he said.\nLack of traditional agent\nSanders doesn\u2019t have a traditional certified NFL agent. His Hall of Famer father, Deion, guides him.\n\"His father has a strong presence in his life. And not to mention he has been through this process. I think a lot of people are intimidated by that,\" former NFL defensive end Hugh Douglas said to USA TODAY Sports.\nA prominent NFL agent told USA TODAY Sports that Sanders\u2019 choice not to have a traditional agent is \u201cself-serving.\" They spoke on condition of anonymity because they don\u2019t represent the QB.\nA traditional agent could\u2019ve informed Sanders of his draft stock or helped him improve his standing.\nIt\u2019s worth noting there are other NFL players who don\u2019t have traditional agents. For example, two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson represents himself, as does 10-time Pro Bowler Bobby Wagner to name a few notable players.\nThe Deion Sanders effect\nLike father, like son?\nDeion Sanders is regarded as the best cornerback in NFL history. He\u2019s a Hall of Famer, two-time Super Bowl champion, six-time first-team All-Pro, eight-time Pro Bowler and was the recipient of the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in 1994. He was one of the most charismatic, flashy and confident athletes in league history, too.\nThe same charisma, flash and confidence has followed him into his coaching career. It\u2019s part of the reason why he\u2019s always in the limelight.\nThe apple doesn't fall far from the tree \u2013 Shedeur harbors a similar personality.\n\u201cShedeur has moxy. He\u2019s loud, he\u2019s arrogant, he\u2019s flashy and he\u2019s proud,\u201d a college football coach told USA TODAY Sports. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nWhy was Shedeur Sanders projected to be top draft pick by pundits?\nSometimes perception isn\u2019t reality. One NFL agent told USA TODAY Sports that many reporters have about four or five sources and often times don\u2019t have a great sense of how the entire NFL views draft prospects.\n\u201cIn terms of Shedeur\u2019s pre-draft projection, there\u2019s a lot of amateur scouting in the media and there\u2019s a lot of misinformation that comes from clubs and agents. Given Shedeur\u2019s notoriety, there\u2019s a greater probability of misinformation because it\u2019s low-hanging fruit for information seekers,\u201d another NFL agent told USA TODAY Sports. The agent spoke on a condition of anonymity because he doesn't represent Sanders.\nThe consensus was this year's QB draft class wasn't strong. Several evaluators pegged Sanders as a second-round prospect. Teams differ in their draft evaluations and have contrasting boards.\n\"I can\u2019t speak to why the market priced him the way it did,\" Browns general manager Andrew Berry said to reporters Saturday. \"We had our own internal evaluation in terms of how we view the skillset and the quality of the player.\"\nMy take\nIt's apparent there were several factors on and off the field that contributed to when Sanders was draft.\nSanders doesn\u2019t have the strongest arm nor is he a very mobile quarterback. Despite those limitations, he\u2019s an accurate passer when protected and a good distributor of the football. His records at Colorado validate that. Plus, he was viewed as a leader among his teammates. I ranked him as the second best quarterback prospect in this year\u2019s draft behind No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward.\nSanders perceived arrogance shouldn\u2019t be criticized as long as he has respect for others. However, poor interviews can negatively impact a player's draft status. It\u2019s a necessity for all athletes to have some level of confidence and or arrogance to be successful. A big part of being a top athlete is psychological. I know this as a former athlete.\nThe Sanders name does come with notoriety, but that can be channeled as a positive under the proper guidance.\nSometimes a team and an environment can determine a player\u2019s level of success in the NFL. Sanders is in a situation where he can earn the starting job in Year 1 given the state of the Browns\u2019 quarterback room.\nThe Browns enter the next phase of the offseason without a clear-cut QB1. Aside from Sanders, they have Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, rookie third-round pick Dillon Gabriel and an injured Deshaun Watson on their roster.\n\"It wasn\u2019t necessarily the plan going into the weekend to select two quarterbacks, but we do believe in best player available. We do believe in positional value. We didn\u2019t necessarily expect him to be available in the fifth round,\u201d Berry said.\n\u201cWe love adding competition to every position room. And adding him to compete with the guys that are already in there, we felt like that was the appropriate thing to do.\u201d\nThe good news for Sanders? He\u2019s got an opportunity to prove his naysayers wrong with the opportunity from Cleveland \u2013 even if that came in the fifth round instead of the first.\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely grateful for the opportunity, throughout everything,\u201d Sanders said to reporters after being drafted by Cleveland.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever focus on the negative or even think about the negative, because the positive happened so fast.\u201d\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon on X @TheTylerDragon."

      "text": "Shedeur Sanders pays speeding tickets, addresses citations at Browns event\nShedeur Sanders has been living life in the fast lane during the month of June. While the quarterback is battling for the Cleveland Browns starting quarterback job on the field, he's been speeding off of it.\nSanders was ticketed for speeding on two separate occasions in June, according to court records.\nAs of Friday morning, both tickets have been paid. Sanders paid $269 in fines and court fees on June 20 to settle his ticket from a June 5 incident, according to records from Medina, Ohio. In addition, the quarterback paid $250 in fines and court costs for his June 17 speeding ticket, which also cost him four points on his license, according to the Strongsville Mayor's Court Online Docketing and Ticket Payment System.\nSanders addressed the incidents at Browns tight end David Njoku's celebrity softball game.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made some wrong choices,\u201d Sanders said with a laugh. \u201cI gotta own up to them. ... I learn from them.\u201d\nSanders was cited for driving 101 mph in a 60 mph speed limit zone in Strongsville, Ohio at around 12:30 a.m. on June 17, according to court records from Medina, Ohio. It was the second incident involving the 23-year-old's speed in June, with the other coming on June 5 in Brunswick, Ohio, where he was ticketed for driving 91 mph in a 65 mph zone.\nHe later failed to appear in court for the first ticket on June 16, leaving $269 outstanding in fines and court costs for the former Colorado quarterback to deal with.\nTeam spokesman Peter John-Baptiste told Cleveland.com on Thursday, \"He is taking care of the tickets.\"\nUp to this point, Sanders has been mostly in the news for good reasons. He's been involved in the community and hasn't let his draft slide dominate the offseason.\nAfter falling to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, Sanders was eventually selected with the 144th overall pick. He's battling Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel for the starting gig \u2014 and a roster spot.\nWhile a pair of speeding tickets won't cost him the job, Sanders will want to return everyone's attention to his work on the field rather than any potential issues off of it.\nRookies are set to report to Browns training camp on July 18 in Berea, Ohio."

      "text": "Shedeur Sanders debut winners, losers: How Browns QB's performance impacts team\nShedeur Sanders' first start as a member of the Cleveland Browns took place earlier than many anticipated it would.\nSanders was tapped to start Cleveland's first preseason game despite being fourth on the team's quarterback depth chart. The fifth-round rookie's opportunity came as Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel dealt with injuries while coach Kevin Stefanski had 40-year-old veteran Joe Flacco sit out the game.\nAs a result, Sanders was given a chance to handle the bulk of the Browns' offseason reps. He and Tyler \"Snoop\" Huntley were the only two quarterbacks to see action during the game, which gave the Colorado product an ideal chance to state his case for a spot on Cleveland's 53-man roster.\nHow did Sanders do in his extensive opportunity? Here are the winners and losers of Sanders' Browns debut against the Carolina Panthers.\nWINNERS\nShedeur Sanders\nSanders was given a chance to play a majority of Cleveland's preseason opener against the Panthers. He did not disappoint in extensive action.\nSanders played most of the first three quarters of Friday's game kept the Browns offense moving, reading the field well and demonstrating sharp accuracy throughout the contest. The 23-year-old was able to thread the needle a couple of times, including on his first touchdown pass, where he threw a strike to Kaden Davis that zipped by two defenders.\nAdditionally, Sanders showed great pocket awareness throughout the contest. He was able to scramble away from pressure on numerous occasions and showed an ability to navigate the pocket while still positioning himself to make downfield throws.\nNotably, he hung in amid pressure on his second touchdown pass of the day. His running back made a nice pick-up in pass protection, which allowed Sanders the time needed to find Davis open in the end-zone.\nThe biggest area for improvement for Sanders came when dropping back to avoid sacks. On several occasions, Sanders dropped back 10-plus yards behind the line of scrimmage and attempted to scramble around oncoming defenders to create a game. He was sacked just twice despite that, but as Caleb Williams learned last season, that may not work against higher-caliber NFL defenses.\nStill, Sanders certainly built some positive momentum during Friday's performance, during which he completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns with a 106.8 passer rating. That could prove crucial for him he jockeys for a role in a wide-open quarterback room.\nDeion Sanders\n\"Coach Prime\" would have relished seeing his son have success in the NFL in any circumstance. Still, there's little doubt the Browns quarterback's solid debut will be sweeter for his father after the 23-year-old signal-caller endured during the Colorado product's draft slide.\nSanders told USA TODAY Sports' Brent Schrotenboer watching his son last until the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft \"did hurt\" him emotionally. Despite the dramatic fall, the 57-year-old coach remained steadfast his son would perform well at the NFL level.\n\"He's gonna be a problem after tonight,\" Sanders said on eve of his son's debut. \"I promise you that.\"\nSanders lived up to that billing in his preseason debut, and his father relished the opportunity to praise him for a job well done during the contest.\nKevin Stefanski\nStefanski has to be happy with what he saw from Sanders on Friday. He deserves credit for giving the fifth-round rookie extensive playing time, even if he had little choice in the matter given the injuries to other quarterbacks on Cleveland's roster.\nThe bigger reason Stefanski is a winner? Sanders' performance gives the Browns a bit of excitement at quarterback. That's something that was undoubtedly lacking in the lead-up to the 2025 NFL season.\nMany wanted to see Sanders in action but weren't sure how the fifth-round rookie would perform. Now that he has performed well, Stefanski could have an ace up his sleeve to insert into Cleveland's lineup if he needs a spark. That's nice for any coach to have, but especially for one coming off a 3-14 season.\nJoe Flacco\nWhile Sanders was the big winner of Friday's game, Flacco still has to be feeling confident after it. The 40-year-old veteran is presently favored to start and saw only one member of his legitimate competition for the starting job, Sanders, see action in the game.\nPickett and Gabriel's inability to suit up in preseason Week 1 should allow Flacco to maintain an advantage in the race for Cleveland's starting job. Sanders stated his case to be a part of the race given his performance against the Panthers, and Pickett or Gabriel could still give Flacco a run for his money if they can play in preseason Week 2.\nFor now, Flacco should be viewed as the favorite to begin the season as Cleveland's top quarterback.\nLOSERS\nDillon Gabriel\nGabriel and Sanders entered training camp engaged in a battle for Cleveland's third-string quarterback job. Sanders took advantage of the strong opportunity he had to stake his claim to that role against the Panthers.\nAs for Gabriel, he missed Cleveland's preseason opener while dealing with a hamstring injury. The malady is considered minor, but nonetheless, his absence opened the door for Sanders to close the gap between the two rookies in the Browns quarterback room.\nThe reason the battle between Gabriel and Sanders is so important is that the fourth-string signal-caller could be in danger of being released. ESPN's Adam Schefter has reported Cleveland is \"more likely than not\" to keep all four of its quarterbacks, but few NFL teams have devoted four, 53-man roster spots to quarterbacks in recent seasons.\nWith Sanders looking good Friday, Gabriel could find himself a little closer to the chopping block than he'd like. He will have to change that over the final two weeks of the preseason.\nKenny Pickett\nPickett was expected to battle Flacco for Cleveland's starting job. He may find himself wondering how secure his roster spot may be after Sanders' performance.\nAs mentioned, the Browns may prefer to keep four quarterbacks on their active roster. After all, Flacco is 40 and may not play much longer, so having a trio of young passers could benefit the team.\nBut if not, could Pickett be the odd man out? He was initially viewed as the top competition for Flacco, but with Sanders performing well in the preseason and Pickett missing time due a hamstring injury, the gap between the two could be closing.\nAdd in the presence of Gabriel, on whom the team spent a third-round pick, and Pickett could find himself in a tight, three-man battle for the backup job.\nSo, while Pickett still seems favored to be Cleveland's No. 2 quarterback to open the season, his footing there is more precarious than it once was.\nNFL teams that passed on Shedeur Sanders\nYes, Sanders' preseason start is just one game. Still, the rookie's debut looked a lot better than those of most fifth-round quarterbacks the NFL has produced in recent seasons.\nDoes that mean every NFL team who passed on Sanders will end up regretting it? Maybe not yet, but Sanders has at least given the quarterback-needy teams who let him last until the fifth round something to chew on."

      "text": "Shedeur Sanders shined vs. Panthers. Will performance shake up Browns' QB depth chart? | Opinion\n- Listed as fourth-string on the Browns' depth chart, Shedeur Sanders got the start vs. the Panthers\n- He finished 14-for-23 for 138 yards and threw two touchdowns\n- What does his performance mean for the Browns' QB competition?\nCHARLOTTE, NC \u2013 So much for the narrative that Shedeur Sanders was set up to fail.\nNo, there\u2019s another way to look at this after the fifth-round rookie quarterback essentially aced his test for the Cleveland Browns in their preseason opener on Friday night.\nSanders was hardly perfect while handling a heavy workload in the 30-10 exhibition win against the Carolina Panthers.\nBut boy was he good. Sanders, 23, threw two touchdown passes to Kaden Davis that looked as if they were guided by laser. He had a few Harry Houdini moments, escaping at least four would-be sacks. He flowed off-script, like on a 30-yard completion that fellow rookie Luke Floriea hauled in with one hand. And he never committed a turnover.\nYet afterward, Sanders (14-of-23, 138 yards, 106.8 passer rating) bemoaned missing on a couple throws that got away.\n\u201cDid I play up to par?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I did.\u201d\nWell, he\u2019s entitled to his opinion, too. So, just imagine what Sanders, listed as fourth-string on the depth chart, might have done if he had worked some practice reps with the starters or the second team. Sanders has yet to have a single rep with the first team during training camp, and has had only a handful with the 2\u2019s. He\u2019s the guy seen during practices working alone on an adjacent field.\nWith Kenny Pickett and rookie Dillon Gabriel, listed behind Joe Flacco, nursing hamstring injuries, Sanders got his chance to start and shine.\nSome suggested he was set up to fail because of his limited practice reps. Sanders, though, has a totally different view.\n\u201cI think overall in life, I don\u2019t want anybody to make excuses,\u201d said Sanders, who led college football in completion percentage in his final year playing for his Hall of Fame father, Deion, at Colorado in 2024 \u2013 then dominated the news cycle during the three-day NFL draft as his stock tumbled from a projected first-round pick to a Day 3 selection.\nSet up to fail?\n\u201cYou ask God for something. It\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to complain about it? So, it\u2019s two ways you can look at it. You can look at it and be thankful and take full advantage of the opportunity. Or you can look at it like \u2018Dang. This is what I\u2019ve been asking for, but I\u2019m not prepared.\u2019 I\u2019ve been able to sleep at night, knowing I was going to be playing. And then I just prepared as normal. Then that switch kicked in. When you\u2019re out there on the field, it feels different. Ball\u2019s ball. Ball has never been a problem for me.\u201d\nSanders may have just played himself into a serious contender for the Browns\u2019 starting job. After all, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski has maintained that it\u2019s an \u201copen\u201d competition. And if that\u2019s the case, Sanders, who played 45 snaps on nine series (excluding a kneel-down at the end of the first half), has at least earned the chance to get reps with the 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s.\nStefanski evaded that question when I asked during his postgame news conference and also wouldn\u2019t touch the topic of the competition. The rookie wouldn\u2019t light a match, either.\nSanders: \u201cI just think about when I got out there, doing what I\u2019ve got to do. Everything else is not in my hand, so why worry about it? I just don\u2019t think that deep into everything because it\u2019s nothing you\u2019re going to be able to control. Why put energy into something that you can\u2019t control? The most you can do is hey, man, if you get your opportunity and your number\u2019s called, perform it. At least to the bare minimum to win the game.\u201d\nThere\u2019s fresh videotape out there now, however, showing Sanders making splash plays like he did at Colorado and demonstrating keen instincts during his big audition. It\u2019s a starting point. Never mind that the Browns didn\u2019t play starters and Carolina played first-teamers for only a couple series.\nAs LeBron James so eloquently put it in a post on X, Sanders\u2019 performance shouldn\u2019t be discounted because he didn\u2019t play with or much against starters.\nAh, social media. Sanders was such a trending topic on Friday night, just as he was during the NFL draft.\nHis famous father, aka Coach Prime, didn\u2019t hesitate to put out a post amid the buzz.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Deion asked on X.\nStefanski and his staff \u2013 including Bill Musgrave, the Browns quarterbacks coach who was a teammate of Deion\u2019s on the San Francisco 49ers squad that won Super Bowl 29 \u2013 can assess so many layers of Sanders\u2019 performance.\nIf you wanted to script a test to cover all of the bases, the Browns couldn\u2019t have done much better than compiling the \u201csituational football\u201d scenarios from Friday night. Sanders operated in a nine-play drive and a two-play drive. On another possession, he faced back-to-back third-and-long plays, converting the first one after he rolled out and bolted from the pocket for a 9-yard run. Another time he powered under the pile to convert a quarterback sneak. Both of his TD passes came while positioned in the red zone. Another series had him backed up deep in his own end, then throwing from the end zone. At the end of the half, a hurry-up drill.\nSaid Stefanski: \u201cThe situations were invaluable for Shedeur, for all of our offense.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s this other situation, reflecting uncharted territory for Sanders. Someone asked about his patience, given the scant opportunities while buried on the depth chart.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different things and different life lessons you\u2019ve got to go through,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t gone through this situation that I\u2019m in, ever. So, it\u2019s really just a test from God. I was just thankful that I was able to see the light of day and get out there and play.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s so striking that he produced so much from so few practice reps.\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with being uncomfortable,\u201d he declared. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is. I\u2019ve got pockets of finding my rhythm. I\u2019ve got to get into that quicker, regardless of anything. But overall, I felt like me out there.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it without the time, I couldn't do it without the play-calling,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, I\u2019m just thankful to have the joy of just being on the field overall. And carrying the responsibility to do the right thing. So, that\u2019s two badges under my belt already.\u201d\nAnd with that, Sanders re-wrote the narrative.\n\u201cMy vow is to definitely make change,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd change was made.\u201d\nWhich adds some major intrigue to the Browns' quarterback situation.\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on social media:\nOn X: @JarrettBell; On Bluesky: jarrettbell.bsky.social"

      "text": "Shedeur Sanders discusses community on Browns podcast: 'Important for my own happiness'\nDespite his draft slide, Shedeur Sanders has remained front and center.\nThe quarterback could've shied away from the spotlight after falling all the way to the fifth round in the 2025 NFL Draft, but that hasn't happened yet. Sanders has been forward-facing during his early days as a Cleveland Browns quarterback.\nSome mock drafts might've had Sanders as an early first-round pick, but for a host of reasons, the a Day 1 or 2 pick wasn't worth the price of admission for the passer. Instead of feeling sorry for himself, Sanders is out in the community and soaking up everything that comes with the opportunity.\nWhether it was getting in a workout with high school kids or speaking with students at another, Sanders is finding the time to connect with the surrounding area.\nDuring an appearance on the latest episode of the Browns \"Best Podcast Available,\" Sanders spoke on how important that is for him.\n\"It's important for my own happiness,\" Sanders said of connecting with the community. \"It makes me happy because I'm able to connect with people, connect with human beings. ... If you live in a world of social media, you are gonna think very negatively, and this for all athletes. You'll think very negatively about yourself or you'll feel too high up. Because that's how media is. You either gonna be high up or they're gonna tear you down. One of the two, no in between.\"\nSanders pointed out that he doesn't pay attention to what happens online.\n\"I focus on real life,\" Sanders said. \"I've never seen hate in real life, by fans and people spectating that I've met. So hate only exists online.\"\nWhen asked how he deals with the hate, the quarterback said he's accustomed to it.\n\"I don't know what people think of me,\" Sanders said in response to a question about the biggest misconception about him.\nFor now, he's just focused about controlling what he can on the field and, as he puts it, proving himself right. That begins with making an impact in a crowded Browns quarterback room."
